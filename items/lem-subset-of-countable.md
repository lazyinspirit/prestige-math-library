## Statement

Let $A$ be at most countable ([[def-countable]]) and let $B \subseteq A$. Then
$B$ is at most countable.

The proof establishes the sharper statement about subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ from
which this follows: **a subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is finite if it is
bounded above, and countably infinite if it is not.**

**No choice principle is used.** This is the point of the lemma rather than a
footnote to it. The enumeration of an unbounded $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is built
by always taking the *least* element of $S$ above the previous one, and the least
element of a nonempty set of naturals is canonical
([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]): it is determined by $S$, not selected from it.
Replacing "least" by "some" would turn the construction into an appeal to
dependent choice.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An at most countable set $A$ and a subset $B \subseteq A$. Throughout, a natural number is the von Neumann natural, so that $0 = \varnothing$ and $\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]); that $n = \{\, m \in \mathbb{N} : m < n \,\}$, and in particular that every element of a natural number is a natural number, is [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]], proved earlier on this page from the additive order of [[def-nat-order]].

[L1] $A$ is finite when $A \approx n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$, countably infinite when $A \approx \mathbb{N}$, and at most countable when one of the two holds ([[def-countable]]).

[L2] $\approx$ is symmetric and transitive, an injection is a bijection onto its image, and the restriction of a bijection to a subset is a bijection onto the image of that subset ([[def-equinumerous]], [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L3] Well-ordering: every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L4] Strong induction: if for every $n$ the truth of $P(m)$ for all $m < n$ implies $P(n)$, then $P(n)$ holds for every $n$ ([[thm-strong-induction]]).

[L5] Recursion: for any set $X$, any $x_0 \in X$ and any $F : X \to X$ there is a function $h : \mathbb{N} \to X$ with $h(0) = x_0$ and $h(\sigma(n)) = F(h(n))$ ([[thm-recursion]]).

[L6] Order facts in $\mathbb{N}$: $m \in n \iff m < n$, $m \le n \iff m \subseteq n$, $n < \sigma(n)$, and $m < \sigma(n) \iff m \le n$ ([[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]); exactly one of $m < n$, $m = n$, $n < m$ holds, so $<$ is irreflexive and any two naturals are comparable ([[lem-nat-trichotomy]]); $\le$ is reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive and total ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]), whence $<$ is transitive, because $m < n < p$ gives $m \le p$ while $m = p$ would force $m = n$ by antisymmetry; $m < n \iff \sigma(m) \le n$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]).

[L7] Every nonzero natural is a successor ([[lem-nat-nonzero-is-successor]]).

[L8] Membership is irreflexive on $\mathbb{N}$: $k \notin k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, and every natural number is a transitive set ([[lem-nat-transitive-irreflexive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Since $A$ is at most countable there is a bijection $\varphi : A \to N_0$ where $N_0 = n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ or $N_0 = \mathbb{N}$; in either case $N_0 \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, and restricting $\varphi$ to $B$ gives a bijection of $B$ onto $S := \varphi[B] \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, so $B \approx S$. It therefore suffices to prove that every subset of $\mathbb{N}$ is at most countable, since then $S \approx n'$ or $S \approx \mathbb{N}$ and transitivity carries the conclusion back to $B$. [given, L1, L2, L6, suffices: every subset of N is at most countable]

1.2 Every subset of a natural number is finite: by strong induction on $n$, assume every subset of every $m < n$ is finite. If $n = 0$ then a subset $T \subseteq 0 = \varnothing$ is empty and $T \approx 0$. Otherwise $n = \sigma(m)$ by [L7], with $m < n$; given $T \subseteq \sigma(m) = m \cup \{m\}$, the set $T \setminus \{m\}$ is a subset of $m$, so the hypothesis at $m$ gives a bijection $u : T \setminus \{m\} \to k$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$. If $m \notin T$ then $T = T \setminus \{m\} \approx k$. If $m \in T$, extend $u$ by $u(m) := k$; since $k \notin k$ by irreflexivity of membership, the value $k$ is not already taken and the extension is a bijection $T \to k \cup \{k\} = \sigma(k)$. In both cases $T$ is finite, so the claim holds for $n$ and hence for all $n$. [L1, L2, L4, L6, L7, L8]

1.3 Case $S$ bounded: assume there is $b_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ with $s \le b_0$ for every $s \in S$. Then $s < \sigma(b_0)$ for every $s \in S$ by [L6], that is, $S \subseteq \sigma(b_0)$. [assume-case bounded, L6]

1.4 Case $S$ unbounded: assume that for every $b \in \mathbb{N}$ there is $s \in S$ with $b < s$. Then $S \ne \varnothing$, and for each $s \in S$ the set $\{\, t \in S : s < t \,\}$ is nonempty, so [L3] makes $\nu(s) := \min \{\, t \in S : s < t \,\}$ a well-defined element of $S$ with $s < \nu(s)$; this defines a function $\nu : S \to S$ with no arbitrary choices. [assume-case unbounded, L3, construct]

2.1 In the bounded case $S$ is a subset of the natural number $\sigma(b_0)$, hence finite by step 1.2, hence at most countable. [step 1.2, step 1.3, L1]

2.2 In the unbounded case apply [L5] with $X = S$, $x_0 = \min S$ (available by [L3] since $S \ne \varnothing$) and $F = \nu$: there is $e : \mathbb{N} \to S$ with $e(0) = \min S$ and $e(\sigma(n)) = \nu(e(n)) = \min \{\, t \in S : e(n) < t \,\}$ for every $n$. [step 1.4, L3, L5, construct]

3.1 For every $n$, $e(n) < e(\sigma(n))$ by the defining property of $\nu$; consequently $m < n$ implies $e(m) < e(n)$, by strong induction on $n$ (for $n = \sigma(j)$ and $m < n$ one has $m \le j$ by [L6], so either $m = j$, giving $e(m) < e(\sigma(j))$ directly, or $m < j$, giving $e(m) < e(j) < e(\sigma(j))$ by the hypothesis at $j$ and transitivity). Hence $e$ is injective: if $m \ne n$ then $m < n$ or $n < m$ by comparability, and irreflexivity forbids $e(m) = e(n)$. [step 2.2, L4, L6, L7]

3.2 For every $k$, $k \le e(k)$: again by strong induction, at $k = 0$ this is immediate, and for $k = \sigma(j)$ the hypothesis at $j$ gives $j \le e(j) < e(\sigma(j))$, so $j < e(k)$ and therefore $\sigma(j) \le e(k)$ by [L6], that is $k \le e(k)$. [step 2.2, L4, L6, L7]

4.1 $e$ is surjective onto $S$: let $t \in S$. The set $K = \{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : t \le e(k) \,\}$ contains $t$ by step 3.2, so $k^\ast := \min K$ exists by [L3]. If $k^\ast = 0$ then $e(0) = \min S \le t$ because $t \in S$, and $t \le e(0)$, so $e(0) = t$. Otherwise $k^\ast = \sigma(j)$ by [L7], and $j \notin K$ by minimality, so $e(j) < t$; then $t$ belongs to $\{\, u \in S : e(j) < u \,\}$, whence $e(k^\ast) = \min \{\, u \in S : e(j) < u \,\} \le t$, and with $t \le e(k^\ast)$ this gives $e(k^\ast) = t$. In both cases $t$ is a value of $e$. [step 2.2, step 3.2, L3, L6, L7]

5.1 In the unbounded case $e : \mathbb{N} \to S$ is therefore a bijection, so $S \approx \mathbb{N}$ and $S$ is countably infinite, hence at most countable. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L1, L2]

6.1 Every $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is either bounded above or not, so steps 2.1 and 5.1 cover all cases and every subset of $\mathbb{N}$ is at most countable; by the reduction of step 1.1 the subset $B$ of the at most countable set $A$ is at most countable. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 5.1, cases-exhaustive, L1, L2] ∎

## Remarks

- A subset of a countably infinite set may perfectly well be finite: $\{0, 1\}$ and $\varnothing$ are subsets of $\mathbb{N}$. This is exactly why the conclusion is "at most countable" and not "countably infinite", and it is why the library's convention that "countable" means "at most countable" ([[def-countable]]) keeps the statement free of case distinctions.

- The dichotomy proved here, bounded subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ are finite and unbounded ones are copies of $\mathbb{N}$, is the only structural fact about $\mathbb{N}$ the rest of the page needs. The enumeration $e$ built in the unbounded case is the increasing one, and it is unique with that property.

- The bounded case rests on the von Neumann encoding: "bounded by $b_0$" is literally "a subset of the set $\sigma(b_0)$", which is what makes the induction of step 1.2 an induction on a natural number rather than on an informal count. That translation is not a convention but a theorem, [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]], since the library's order on $\mathbb{N}$ is defined additively ([[def-nat-order]]) and not by membership.
