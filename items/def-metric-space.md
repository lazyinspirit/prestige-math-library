## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) constructed in this
library ([[def-real-numbers]]) and carrying its order ([[def-real-order]]).

Let $X$ be a set. A **metric** on $X$ is a function
$d : X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $x, y, z \in X$:

- **(M1) Separation.** $d(x,y) = 0$ if and only if $x = y$.
- **(M2) Symmetry.** $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$.
- **(M3) Triangle inequality.** $d(x,z) \le d(x,y) + d(y,z)$.

A **metric space** is a pair $(X,d)$ consisting of a set $X$ and a metric $d$ on
it. The elements of $X$ are its **points** and $d(x,y)$ is the **distance** from
$x$ to $y$. When only one metric is in play we write $X$ for $(X,d)$; when
several are, the metric is always named.

**The values of a metric are real numbers.** The codomain is $\mathbb{R}$, so
$d(x,y)$ is an honest element of the complete ordered field and every
inequality above is an inequality there. No infinite value is permitted;
[[rem-metric-axiom-conventions]] records why extended metrics are not treated in
this library.

**Nonnegativity is deliberately absent from the axiom list.** Many texts add a
fourth axiom $d(x,y) \ge 0$. It is redundant: (M1), (M2) and (M3) already force
it, as [[lem-metric-nonnegativity]] proves. Nothing below assumes it before that
lemma is available.

**Pseudometric.** A **pseudometric** on $X$ is a function
$p : X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying (M2), (M3) and the weakening

- **(M1') Reflexivity.** $p(x,x) = 0$ for every $x \in X$

of (M1). A pseudometric may therefore assign distance $0$ to two distinct
points. Every metric is a pseudometric, and a pseudometric is a metric exactly
when $p(x,y) = 0$ forces $x = y$.

**Ultrametric.** An **ultrametric** on $X$ is a metric $d$ that in addition
satisfies

- **(M3') Strong triangle inequality.** $d(x,z) \le \max\{d(x,y), d(y,z)\}$

for all $x, y, z \in X$, where the maximum is that of a two-element subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, which exists and is one of the two elements
([[def-max-min]], [[lem-finite-set-has-max]]). An **ultrametric space** is a pair
$(X,d)$ with $d$ an ultrametric.

## Remarks

- **(M3') is a genuine strengthening of (M3), not an independent axiom on top of
  it.** A function satisfying (M1), (M2) and (M3') automatically satisfies (M3):
  by [[lem-metric-nonnegativity]] such a function is nonnegative, and for
  nonnegative reals $a, b$ one has $\max\{a,b\} \le a + b$, since the maximum is
  one of $a, b$ and the other summand is $\ge 0$. So "a metric satisfying (M3')"
  and "a function satisfying (M1), (M2), (M3')" describe the same objects, and
  the definition above may be read either way.

- **Why the biconditional form of (M1).** Splitting (M1) into "$d(x,x) = 0$" and
  "$d(x,y) = 0 \Rightarrow x = y$" gives the same notion; the split form is what
  makes the pseudometric weakening above a matter of deleting one clause. The
  naming fork between *pseudometric* and *semimetric*, which is live in the
  literature, is settled for this library in
  [[rem-metric-axiom-conventions]].

- **The metric is part of the data.** Two different metrics on the same set are
  two different metric spaces, even when they have the same open sets. That is
  why [[def-equivalent-metrics]] compares metrics at three separate strengths
  rather than one, and why a property can be invariant under one of them and not
  under another ([[fs-boundedness-is-a-topological-property]]).
