## Statement

Let $(a_k)$, $(x_k)$ and $(b_k)$ be sequences of reals ([[def-sequence]]) with

$$a_k \le x_k \le b_k \quad \text{eventually},$$

and suppose $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ both converge to the same real $L$
([[def-real-limit]]). Then $(x_k)$ converges to $L$.

The middle sequence is not assumed to converge; that is the point of the
theorem, and it is why the squeeze is a tool for *establishing* convergence
rather than for computing a limit already known to exist.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $(a_k)$, $(x_k)$, $(b_k)$ of reals, an index $K_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ with $a_k \le x_k \le b_k$ for every $k \ge K_0$, and a real $L$ such that $(a_k)$ converges to $L$ and $(b_k)$ converges to $L$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L1] Convergence, quantified over rational $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-real-limit]]).

[L2] Absolute value: for $c > 0$, $|u| < c$ if and only if $-c < u < c$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L3] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: adding a constant preserves $<$ and $\le$; $u < v \le w$ and $u \le v < w$ both give $u < w$; and $\le$ is transitive ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L4] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total and transitive, so three indices $K_0, K_1, K_2$ admit an index $K$ with $K \ge K_0$, $K \ge K_1$ and $K \ge K_2$, and then $k \ge K$ gives $k \ge K_0$, $k \ge K_1$, $k \ge K_2$ ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be rational. By convergence of $(a_k)$ there is $K_1$ with $|a_k - L| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K_1$, and by convergence of $(b_k)$ there is $K_2$ with $|b_k - L| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K_2$. [L1]

2.1 By [L2], $|a_k - L| < \varepsilon$ gives $-\varepsilon < a_k - L$, that is $L - \varepsilon < a_k$, for all $k \ge K_1$; and $|b_k - L| < \varepsilon$ gives $b_k - L < \varepsilon$, that is $b_k < L + \varepsilon$, for all $k \ge K_2$. [step 1.1, L2, L3]

3.1 Choose $K$ with $K \ge K_0$, $K \ge K_1$ and $K \ge K_2$. For every $k \ge K$ the hypothesis gives $a_k \le x_k \le b_k$, so $L - \varepsilon < a_k \le x_k \le b_k < L + \varepsilon$, hence $L - \varepsilon < x_k < L + \varepsilon$, hence $-\varepsilon < x_k - L < \varepsilon$, hence $|x_k - L| < \varepsilon$. [step 2.1, given, L2, L3, L4, choose]

4.1 The rational $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary, so for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is an index $K$ beyond which $|x_k - L| < \varepsilon$; that is, $(x_k)$ converges to $L$. [step 3.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- The proof is direct from the definition and does not route through [[lem-limit-preserves-order]]. It could not: that lemma assumes the middle sequence converges, which is what is being proved here.

- Both bounding sequences must have the **same** limit. With $a_k = -1$, $b_k = 1$ and any $(x_k)$ taking values in $[-1, 1]$ the hypothesis $a_k \le x_k \le b_k$ holds and nothing whatever follows, since a bounded sequence need not converge ([[fs-bounded-implies-convergent]]).

- The most common use is with $a_k = -c_k$ and $b_k = c_k$ for a null sequence $(c_k)$: if $|x_k| \le c_k$ eventually and $c_k \to 0$, then $x_k \to 0$. That special case also follows from [[lem-null-times-bounded]] whenever $x_k$ is presented as a product, but the squeeze needs no such presentation.
