## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]). For a natural number
$n \ge 1$, write $n \cdot 1_F := \underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$ for the
$n$-fold sum of the multiplicative identity, and $0 \cdot 1_F := 0$. These are
the **canonical natural numbers** of $F$.

$F$ is **Archimedean** if for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n$ with

$$x < n \cdot 1_F.$$

Equivalently, the canonical naturals $(n \cdot 1_F)_{n \ge 1}$ are **cofinal**:
no single element of $F$ is an upper bound for all of them.

## Remarks

- Equivalently (applying the definition to $1/\varepsilon$): for every
  $\varepsilon > 0$ in $F$ there is $n$ with $1/(n \cdot 1_F) < \varepsilon$, so
  the canonical fractions $1/n$ are arbitrarily small.
- That the canonical naturals are well-defined, positive, and strictly
  increasing is [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]. Every complete ordered field is
  Archimedean ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); an ordered field need not be
  ([[cex-ordered-field-not-archimedean]]).
