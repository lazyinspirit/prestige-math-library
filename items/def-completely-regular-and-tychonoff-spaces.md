## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]) and let
$[0,1] \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ carry the subspace topology of the usual topology of
$\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-interval]], [[def-subspace-topology-top]],
[[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]], [[def-metrizable-space]]).

- $X$ is **completely regular** when a point can be separated from a closed set
  not containing it *by a continuous function*: for every closed $C \subseteq X$
  and every $x_0 \in X \setminus C$ there is a continuous
  $f : X \to [0,1]$ ([[def-continuous-map-top]]) with
  $$f(x_0) = 1 \qquad \text{and} \qquad f(y) = 0 \ \text{ for every } y \in C .$$
- $X$ is **Tychonoff**, also written **$T_{3\frac{1}{2}}$** and *completely
  regular Hausdorff*, when it is completely regular **and** $T_1$
  ([[def-t0-and-t1-spaces]]).

The case $C = \varnothing$ is allowed and is satisfied by the constant function
$1$, which is continuous ([[def-zero-sets-and-cozero-sets]]); so the condition
hides no nonemptiness hypothesis.

**The same condition in the vocabulary of zero sets.** With $f$ as displayed,
$C \subseteq Z(f)$ and $x_0 \in \operatorname{coz}(f)$
([[def-zero-sets-and-cozero-sets]]), so complete regularity says: for every
closed $C$ and every $x_0 \notin C$ there is a continuous $f$ whose zero set
contains $C$ and whose cozero set contains $x_0$. In particular
$\operatorname{coz}(f)$ is an open set containing $x_0$ and disjoint from $C$;
that alone is weaker than regularity, and the passage from the function to two
*disjoint* open sets is the next item.

**The values $0$ and $1$ are a normalisation, not a restriction.** If
$g : X \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous with $g(x_0) = a$, $g[C] = \{b\}$ and
$a \ne b$, then the condition above is met by a function built from $g$ by an
affine change of variable followed by truncation into $[0,1]$; this page never
needs that construction, because every function it builds is already normalised.
The *direction* of the normalisation is a genuine convention and is fixed here as
$f(x_0) = 1$ and $f[C] = \{0\}$, following the most common usage; some texts
write the reverse, and a reader must check which is meant before quoting a
formula.

**The convention fork over $T_1$ is the same one as for regularity.** *Completely
regular* names the function-separation condition alone, and Tychonoff names the
conjunction with $T_1$ ([[def-regular-and-t3-spaces]]). The indiscrete topology
on a two-point set ([[def-standard-topologies]]) is completely regular, its only
closed set disjoint from a point being $\varnothing$, and it is not $T_0$; so the
two halves are independent here as well.

## Remarks

- **Complete regularity is a strong hypothesis in disguise.** It asserts the
  existence of many continuous real-valued functions, and a space may have almost
  none; producing such functions is what Urysohn's lemma does for normal $T_1$
  spaces, and that lemma is not available at this point in the reading order
  ([[rem-separation-axiom-conventions]]).

- **Why the numeral is $3\frac12$.** Complete regularity implies regularity, as
  the next item proves, and every normal $T_1$ space is completely regular, which
  this page does **not** prove; so the axiom sits between $T_3$ and $T_4$, and
  the fractional numeral records that position and nothing more.

- **Both names are in use for the conjunction.** *Tychonoff*, *completely regular
  Hausdorff* and *$T_{3\frac12}$* denote the same class; this library writes
  Tychonoff.
