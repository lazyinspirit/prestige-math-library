## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]).

- $X$ is **normal** when any two disjoint closed sets can be separated by
  disjoint open sets: for all closed $A, B \subseteq X$ with
  $A \cap B = \varnothing$ there are $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$ with
  $$A \subseteq U, \qquad B \subseteq V, \qquad U \cap V = \varnothing .$$
- $X$ is **$T_4$** when it is normal **and** $T_1$ ([[def-t0-and-t1-spaces]]).

Either of $A$, $B$ may be empty, and those cases are met by $U = \varnothing$ or
$V = \varnothing$ together with $X$; so the condition hides no nonemptiness
hypothesis. As with regularity, "disjoint open sets" may equivalently be read as
"disjoint open neighbourhoods of the two sets" ([[def-neighbourhood-top]]).

**Normality is the special case of complete normality at a disjoint closed
pair.** Disjoint closed sets are separated in the sense of
[[def-separated-sets]], since the closure of a closed set is itself; so a space
in which every *separated* pair can be put into disjoint open sets is in
particular normal. That stronger condition is defined later on this page, and the
implication is proved there.

**The convention fork, and this library's side of it.** Exactly as for
regularity, textbooks disagree about whether *normal* carries a $T_1$ hypothesis.
Munkres builds it in; Kelley, Willard and Engelking do not. **This library takes
the second side**: *normal* names the separation condition alone, $T_4$ names
normal plus $T_1$, and the $T_1$ hypothesis is written out wherever it is used.
The reason is again that the two halves are independent, and here the point is
sharp: **normality without $T_1$ implies nothing at all** in the hierarchy. The
indiscrete topology on a two-point set ([[def-standard-topologies]]) is normal,
its only closed sets being $\varnothing$ and the whole space, and it is not even
$T_0$; Sierpinski space is normal, $T_0$ and not regular. Both are recorded on
this page, the first as a false statement and both on the companion page.

## Remarks

- **Normality does not imply regularity**, and the failure is witnessed by
  Sierpinski space on the companion page, which is normal and not regular.
  Whether *regularity* implies normality is a question this page leaves open: any
  witness reachable from the material here would need cardinal arithmetic or the
  hereditary behaviour of regularity. Neither is supplied by this page's declared
  prerequisites: the planned page carrying cardinal arithmetic and cofinality sits
  *below* this one and is not yet built, and the hereditary and productive
  behaviour of the separation axioms is planned for a page *above* this one. So
  nothing above asserts an answer and no false statement asserting one is planted
  here ([[rem-separation-axiom-conventions]]).

- **Normality is the axiom that behaves worst**, and the companion page shows
  one symptom: the deleted Tychonoff plank, a subspace of a product of two
  ordinal spaces each of which is $T_3$, is Hausdorff and not normal. Whether
  normality is inherited by subspaces or preserved by products is a question this
  page does not answer, and nothing here asserts an answer; the plank is
  presented only as a Hausdorff space that fails normality.

- **What the definition does *not* say.** It says nothing about separating a
  point from a closed set, because a point need not be closed; that is the
  content of the $T_1$ hypothesis in $T_4$, and the theorem two items below is
  where it is spent.
