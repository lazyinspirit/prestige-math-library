## Statement

Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals with partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$, let
$N \in \mathbb{N}$, and let $t_j := \sum_{i<j} a_{N+i}$ be the partial sums of the
$N$-th tail series $\sum_{k \ge N} a_k$ ([[def-series]]). Then:

1. $t_j = s_{j+N} - s_N$ for every $j \in \mathbb{N}$;
2. $\sum a_k$ converges **if and only if** its $N$-th tail series converges, and
   in that case
   $$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k \;=\; s_N \;+\; \sum_{k=N}^{\infty} a_k ;$$
3. hence the following are equivalent: $\sum a_k$ converges; every tail series of
   $\sum a_k$ converges; some tail series of $\sum a_k$ converges.

In words: convergence of a series is a property of its terms from any index on,
and changing finitely many terms changes the sum but not the fact of convergence.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(a_k)$ of reals, a natural number $N$, the partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ and the partial sums $t_j = \sum_{i<j} a_{N+i}$ of the $N$-th tail series ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[L1] Splitting of finite sums: if $m \le n$ then $\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]), and $\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k$ is by definition $\sum_{i<n-m} a_{m+i}$ ([[def-finite-sum]]).

[L2] Convergence depends only on the tail: a sequence $(x_n)$ converges to $x$ if and only if its $N$-th tail $(x_{j+N})_{j}$ converges to $x$ ([[lem-limit-of-tail]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L3] Algebra of limits: if $x_j \to x$ and $y_j \to y$ then $x_j + y_j \to x + y$ and $x_j - y_j \to x - y$ ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]]).

[L4] A constant sequence $y_j = c$ converges to $c$, immediately from the definition of a limit ([[def-real-limit]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Fix $j \in \mathbb{N}$ and put $n := j + N$, so that $N \le n$ and $n - N = j$. [given]

1.2 The family $(s_{j+N})_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ is the $N$-th tail of the sequence $(s_n)$ of partial sums. [given, L2]

2.1 Splitting the partial sum $s_n$ at $N$ gives $s_n = \sum_{k<N} a_k + \sum_{k=N}^{n-1} a_k = s_N + \sum_{i<j} a_{N+i} = s_N + t_j$. [step 1.1, L1]

2.2 Suppose $\sum a_k$ converges, say $s_n \to S$; then the $N$-th tail $(s_{j+N})_j$ converges to $S$. [given, step 1.2, L2]

3.1 Claim 1 follows: $t_j = s_{j+N} - s_N$ for every $j \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.1, algebra]

4.1 The constant sequence with value $s_N$ converges to $s_N$, so $t_j = s_{j+N} - s_N \to S - s_N$, and the $N$-th tail series converges with sum $S - s_N$. [step 2.2, step 3.1, L3, L4]

4.2 Conversely, suppose the $N$-th tail series converges, say $t_j \to T$; then $s_{j+N} = s_N + t_j \to s_N + T$ by the same two rules. [step 3.1, L3, L4]

5.1 So the $N$-th tail of $(s_n)$ converges to $s_N + T$, hence $(s_n)$ itself converges to $s_N + T$ and $\sum a_k$ converges. [step 4.2, step 1.2, L2]

6.1 Claim 2 follows: the two convergences are equivalent, and when they hold the sums are related by $S = s_N + T$, which is the displayed identity. [step 4.1, step 5.1, algebra]

7.1 Claim 3 follows as well: if $\sum a_k$ converges then by claim 2 every tail series converges; every tail series converging trivially gives some tail series converging, the family of tails being indexed by all of $\mathbb{N}$; and if some tail series, say the $N$-th, converges then by claim 2 again $\sum a_k$ converges. [step 6.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the hypothesis-free character comes from.** Nothing here assumes the terms have a sign or that any series converges: claim 1 is an identity between finite sums, valid always, and claims 2 and 3 are read off from it by two standard limit rules. That is why the lemma may be used to move between a series and its tails inside proofs that have not yet decided the convergence question.

- **The sum does change.** Only the fact of convergence is tail invariant. The identity in claim 2 is the exact bookkeeping: discarding the first $N$ terms lowers the sum by $s_N$, and no more.
