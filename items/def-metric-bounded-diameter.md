## Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]) and let
$A, B \subseteq X$.

**Bounded subset.** $A$ is **bounded** if $A = \emptyset$ or there are $x_0 \in X$
and a real $r > 0$ with $A \subseteq B(x_0, r)$ ([[def-metric-ball]]). The space
$(X,d)$ is a **bounded metric space** if $X$ is a bounded subset of itself.

**Diameter, for nonempty bounded $A$ only.** Suppose $A$ is nonempty and
bounded, and put

$$D(A) := \{\, d(a,b) : a, b \in A \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}.$$

Then $D(A)$ is nonempty, since $A$ is, and it is bounded above: fixing $x_0$ and
$r$ with $A \subseteq B(x_0,r)$, every $a, b \in A$ satisfy
$d(a,b) \le d(a,x_0) + d(x_0,b) < r + r$ by the triangle inequality, symmetry
([[def-metric-space]]) and addition of inequalities ([[lem-of-add-order]],
[[def-ordered-field]]), so $r + r$ is an upper bound of $D(A)$
([[def-bounded-set]]). Hence $D(A)$ has a least upper bound in $\mathbb{R}$ by
the least-upper-bound property ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), and that bound
is unique ([[lem-sup-unique]]). Define

$$\operatorname{diam}(A) := \sup D(A).$$

**Distance from a point to a set, for nonempty $A$ only.** Let $x \in X$ and let
$A$ be nonempty, and put $E(x,A) := \{\, d(x,a) : a \in A \,\}$. Then $E(x,A)$ is
nonempty and bounded below by $0$, since a metric is nonnegative
([[lem-metric-nonnegativity]], [[def-bounded-set]]), so it has a greatest lower
bound ([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]), unique by [[lem-sup-unique]].
Define

$$d(x,A) := \inf E(x,A).$$

**Distance between two sets, for nonempty $A$ and $B$ only.** Put
$E(A,B) := \{\, d(a,b) : a \in A,\ b \in B \,\}$, again nonempty and bounded
below by $0$, and define

$$d(A,B) := \inf E(A,B).$$

**Every one of the three scope restrictions is load bearing.** In this library
$\sup$ and $\inf$ denote real numbers and are written only after existence has
been established; there is no extended real line and no convention
$\sup \emptyset = -\infty$ ([[rem-sup-conventions]]). Accordingly:

- $\operatorname{diam}(A)$ is defined exactly when $A$ is nonempty **and**
  bounded. It is not defined for $A = \emptyset$, and it is not defined, not even
  as an infinite value, for an unbounded $A$.
- $d(x,A)$ is defined exactly when $A \ne \emptyset$, and $d(A,B)$ exactly when
  both $A$ and $B$ are nonempty. No boundedness is needed for these two, because
  $0$ is always a lower bound.

## Remarks

- **Diameter and the distance functions are nonnegative.** For nonempty bounded
  $A$ and any $a \in A$ we have $0 = d(a,a) \in D(A)$, so
  $\operatorname{diam}(A) \ge 0$; and $d(x,A) \ge 0$, $d(A,B) \ge 0$ because $0$
  is a lower bound of the sets they are infima of
  ([[lem-metric-nonnegativity]], [[def-infimum]]).
- **$d(A,B)$ is not a metric on the nonempty subsets of $X$.** It is symmetric
  and vanishes on $A = B$, but two distinct disjoint sets can be at distance $0$,
  so the separation axiom (M1) of [[def-metric-space]] fails; the witness is on
  the companion page. The letter $d$ is reused for three different functions
  here, the metric, the point-to-set distance and the set-to-set distance, only
  because the arguments make the intended one unambiguous.
- **$d(x,A)$ is the special case $d(\{x\},A)$**, since
  $E(\{x\},A) = E(x,A)$, and the two infima therefore agree by uniqueness
  ([[lem-sup-unique]]).
