## Statement

Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals. If the series $\sum |a_k|$ converges
([[def-series]]) then the series $\sum a_k$ converges.

A series with the property that $\sum |a_k|$ converges is called **absolutely
convergent**; the lemma says that absolute convergence implies convergence.

The same statement holds for a family from a general starting index $m$, being
this statement applied to the shifted sequence $j \mapsto a_{j+m}$
([[def-series]]).

**The converse is false**, and the standard witness is the alternating harmonic
series. That witness is not available on this page: its convergence is the
alternating series test, which is not proved here. Nothing below asserts a
converse, and no item on this page uses one.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(a_k)$ of reals such that the series $\sum |a_k|$ converges, with partial sums as in [[def-series]] and finite sums as in [[def-finite-sum]].

[L1] The Cauchy criterion for series: $\sum d_k$ converges if and only if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $N \in \mathbb{N}$ with $\big|\sum_{k=p+1}^{n} d_k\big| < \varepsilon$ for all $n > p \ge N$ ([[thm-series-cauchy-criterion]], [[def-series]]).

[L2] Triangle inequality for finite sums: $\big|\sum_{k<d} u_k\big| \le \sum_{k<d}|u_k|$ ([[lem-triangle-inequality-finite]]); the block $\sum_{k=p+1}^{n} u_k$ is by definition the finite sum $\sum_{t < n-p} u_{p+1+t}$ ([[def-finite-sum]]), so applying the inequality to the shifted sequence $t \mapsto u_{p+1+t}$ gives $\big|\sum_{k=p+1}^{n} u_k\big| \le \sum_{k=p+1}^{n} |u_k|$ for all naturals $n > p$.

[L3] Monotonicity of finite sums: if $x_t \ge 0$ for all $t < d$ then $\sum_{t<d} x_t \ge 0$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L4] Absolute value: $|u| \ge 0$ for every real $u$, and $|u| = u$ whenever $u \ge 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L5] Convergence of a real sequence, and the fact that the real and rational formulations of a tolerance agree ([[def-real-limit]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real; since $\sum |a_k|$ converges, the Cauchy criterion applied to the sequence $(|a_k|)$ supplies $N \in \mathbb{N}$ with $\big|\sum_{k=p+1}^{n} |a_k|\big| < \varepsilon$ for all $n > p \ge N$. [L1, L5, choose]

1.2 For all naturals $n > p$ the block $\sum_{k=p+1}^{n} |a_k|$ is a finite sum of nonnegative terms, hence nonnegative, hence equal to its own absolute value. [L2, L3, L4]

2.1 So for all $n > p \ge N$ one has $\big|\sum_{k=p+1}^{n} a_k\big| \le \sum_{k=p+1}^{n} |a_k| = \big|\sum_{k=p+1}^{n} |a_k|\big| < \varepsilon$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L2]

3.1 As $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary, the sequence $(a_k)$ satisfies the Cauchy criterion, so $\sum a_k$ converges. [step 2.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Nothing here identifies the two sums**, and they are in general different. What is proved is that the second series converges, not that it converges to the same value; the bound $\big|\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k\big| \le \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}|a_k|$ is true and is not needed anywhere on this page, so it is not proved here.

- **Why the Cauchy criterion is the right instrument.** The terms have no sign, so [[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]] does not apply to $\sum a_k$ and boundedness of its partial sums would prove nothing. The Cauchy criterion is the one convergence test on this page that never names a candidate sum and never asks for a sign, and the whole proof is the observation that its hypothesis for $(|a_k|)$ implies its hypothesis for $(a_k)$, term by term, through one application of the finite triangle inequality.

- **What this unlocks on this page.** The root test ([[thm-root-test]]) and the ratio test ([[thm-ratio-test]]) each produce convergence of $\sum |a_k|$ directly, by comparison with a geometric series; with this lemma both reach their standard conclusion, the convergence of $\sum a_k$ itself. Without it their convergence halves would be strictly weaker than the classical statements.

- **The systematic theory is elsewhere.** Rearrangement, the Riemann series theorem, conditional convergence and products of series all belong with absolute convergence and are developed on a later page of this track. This lemma is only the one implication those two tests need.
