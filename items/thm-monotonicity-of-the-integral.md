## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]). Then:

1. **Nonnegativity.** If $f(x) \ge 0$ for every $x \in [a,b]$ then
   $\int_a^b f \ge 0$.
2. **Monotonicity.** If $f(x) \le g(x)$ for every $x \in [a,b]$ then
   $$\int_a^b f \;\le\; \int_a^b g .$$
3. **Two-sided bound.** If $m \le f(x) \le M$ for every $x \in [a,b]$, with
   $m, M$ real, then
   $$m\,(b-a) \;\le\; \int_a^b f \;\le\; M\,(b-a) .$$

**Equality in claim 1 does not force $f$ to vanish.** A nonnegative integrable
function with integral $0$ may be positive at infinitely many points; that is
[[fs-nonnegative-integrable-with-zero-integral-vanishes]] on the previous page's
companion. Under the additional hypothesis of continuity the conclusion does
hold, and that is [[thm-nonnegative-continuous-with-zero-integral-vanishes]]
below.

**Claim 2 is stated for $a < b$ and is not orientation-invariant.** With the
convention of [[def-oriented-integral]], $f \le g$ gives
$\int_u^v f \le \int_u^v g$ when $u \le v$ and the reverse inequality when
$u \ge v$, since both sides change sign together.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and integrable $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, with reals $m \le M$ where claim 3 is concerned.

[A1] $f(x) \ge 0$ for every $x \in [a,b]$.

[A2] $f(x) \le g(x)$ for every $x \in [a,b]$.

[A3] $m \le f(x) \le M$ for every $x \in [a,b]$.

[L1] If $m' \le h \le M'$ on $[a,b]$ then $m'(b-a) \le L(h,P) \le \underline{\int_a^b} h \le \overline{\int_a^b} h \le U(h,P) \le M'(b-a)$ for every partition $P$ ([[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]], [[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L2] If $h$ is integrable then $\int_a^b h$ is the common value of the lower and upper integrals ([[def-darboux-integral]], [[def-infimum]]).

[L3] Sums and scalar multiples of integrable functions are integrable, and $\int_a^b(\lambda h + \nu k) = \lambda\int_a^b h + \nu\int_a^b k$ ([[thm-linearity-of-the-integral]]).

[L4] Ordered-field arithmetic: adding a constant to both sides of an inequality preserves it, and the order is total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). The nonstrict forms follow from the strict ones by adjoining the case of equality.

[L5] With oriented limits, $\int_v^u h = -\int_u^v h$ ([[def-oriented-integral]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Claim 1.** Under [A1] the constant $0$ is a lower bound of $f$ on $[a,b]$, so [L1] applies with $m' := 0$ and gives $\underline{\int_a^b} f \ge 0$. [A1, L1]

1.2 **Claim 2.** Under [A2] the function $h := g - f$ satisfies $h(x) \ge 0$ for every $x \in [a,b]$, and $h$ is integrable with $\int_a^b h = \int_a^b g - \int_a^b f$ by [L3]. [A2, L3, L4]

2.1 Since $f$ is integrable, $\int_a^b f = \underline{\int_a^b} f \ge 0$ by [L2]. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 By claim 1 applied to $h$, $\int_a^b g - \int_a^b f \ge 0$, that is $\int_a^b f \le \int_a^b g$. [step 2.1, step 1.2, L4]

4.1 **Claim 3.** Under [A3], [L1] applied to $f$ with $m' := m$ and $M' := M$ gives $m(b-a) \le \underline{\int_a^b} f$ and $\overline{\int_a^b} f \le M(b-a)$, and both integrals equal $\int_a^b f$ by [L2]. [A3, L1, L2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Claim 3 is cited, not reproved.** [[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]] already proves the five-term chain for every partition, and it is the item that also computes the integral of a constant, $\int_a^b c = c(b-a)$. Claim 3 is that chain read at an integrable $f$; nothing new is established here.

- **Claim 2 is proved through claim 1 and linearity, and not by comparing Darboux sums.** Comparing sums works too, since $f \le g$ gives $m_i(f) \le m_i(g)$ and $M_i(f) \le M_i(g)$ on every subinterval, but the route through $g - f$ is shorter and uses only results already available. Either way the hypothesis is a pointwise inequality on the *whole* of $[a,b]$; an inequality holding off a finite set gives the same conclusion, by [[lem-changing-a-function-at-finitely-many-points]], and that is a separate statement.

- **What claim 2 is for.** It is what turns a pointwise estimate on an integrand into an estimate on the integral, and every estimate of that shape on this page and its companion is an application of it. No count of those applications is asserted here; the dependency graph of the page is where that is read off.
