## Statement

Every Cauchy filter $\mathcal F$ canonically determines a unique Cauchy filter $m(\mathcal F)\subseteq\mathcal F$ that has no strictly coarser Cauchy filter. For every $x\in X$, the principal filter $\mathcal P_x:=\{A\subseteq X:x\in A\}$ is Cauchy and therefore has an associated minimal Cauchy filter $m(\mathcal P_x)$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A Cauchy filter $\mathcal F$ on a uniform space.

[L1] Cauchyness supplies arbitrarily small members of $\mathcal F$ ([[def-cauchy-filter-in-a-uniform-space]]).

[L2] Filter bases generate the least filter containing them ([[def-filter-base]], [[lem-filter-base-generates]]).

[L3] Symmetric entourages form a base and may be chosen with prescribed finite-composite control ([[lem-symmetric-entourages-form-a-base]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 Let $\mathcal B$ consist of all $E[A]$ with $A\in\mathcal F$ and symmetric entourage $E$. Every such set contains the nonempty set $A$. Given $E[A],D[B]\in\mathcal B$, the symmetric entourage $E\cap D$ and the member $A\cap B\in\mathcal F$ give $$ (E\cap D)[A\cap B]\subseteq E[A]\cap D[B]. $$ Thus $\mathcal B$ is a proper downward-directed filter base. Let $m(\mathcal F)$ be the filter it generates. [L2, L3, construct]

2.1 Since $A\subseteq E[A]$, every member of $\mathcal B$ belongs to $\mathcal F$, so $m(\mathcal F)\subseteq\mathcal F$. To prove it Cauchy, let $U$ be an entourage and choose a symmetric $E$ with $E^{\circ3}\subseteq U$. Choose $A\in\mathcal F$ with $A\times A\subseteq E$. If $y,z\in E[A]$, take $a,b\in A$ with $aEy$ and $bEz$; symmetry gives $yEaEbEz$, so $(y,z)\in E^{\circ3}\subseteq U$. Hence $E[A]\in m(\mathcal F)$ is $U$-small. [L1, L3, step 1.1]

2.2 Let $\mathcal G\subseteq\mathcal F$ be Cauchy, and fix $E[A]\in\mathcal B$. Choose a symmetric $D$ with $D\subseteq E$, and a $D$-small $B\in\mathcal G$. Since $A,B\in\mathcal F$, choose $c\in A\cap B$. Then $B\subseteq D[c]\subseteq E[A]$, so $E[A]\in\mathcal G$. Thus every Cauchy filter coarser than $\mathcal F$ contains $m(\mathcal F)$. [L1, L3, step 1.1, choose]

3.1 If a Cauchy filter is coarser than $m(\mathcal F)$, step 2.2 places $m(\mathcal F)$ inside it, so equality holds; hence $m(\mathcal F)$ is minimal. Any minimal Cauchy filter coarser than $\mathcal F$ contains $m(\mathcal F)$ by step 2.2 and must equal it by minimality. This proves uniqueness. [step 2.1, step 2.2]

4.1 For $x\in X$, the set $\{x\}$ belongs to $\mathcal P_x$, and $\{x\}\times\{x\}\subseteq\Delta_X\subseteq E$ for every entourage $E$. Thus $\mathcal P_x$ is Cauchy by [L1], and step 3.1 supplies its associated minimal Cauchy filter. [L1, step 3.1, discharge-construct] ∎
