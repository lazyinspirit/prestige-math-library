## Statement

The relation $\le$ on $\mathbb{N}$, where $m \le n \iff \exists k\ (m + k = n)$ ([[def-nat-order]]), is a linear (total) order: reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive, and total.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The order $m \le n \iff \exists k\ (m + k = n)$ ([[def-nat-order]]) and addition with $m + 0 = m$, $m + \sigma(n) = \sigma(m + n)$ ([[def-nat-addition]]).

[L1] $0 + k = k$ and addition is associative ([[lem-nat-add-identity]], [[lem-nat-add-associative]]).

[L2] Cancellation: $m + k = n + k \Rightarrow m = n$ ([[lem-nat-add-cancellative]]).

[L3] Every nonzero natural is a successor: if $j \ne 0$ then $j = \sigma(i)$ for some $i$ ([[lem-nat-nonzero-is-successor]]).

[L4] Trichotomy: exactly one of $m < n$, $m = n$, $m > n$ holds ([[lem-nat-trichotomy]]).

[L5] Addition is commutative ([[lem-nat-add-commutative]]).

[L6] $\sigma(x) \ne 0$ for every $x$ (Peano axiom P1) ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Reflexive: $m + 0 = m$, so $m \le m$. [given]

1.2 Transitive: if $m \le n$ and $n \le p$, say $m + k = n$ and $n + j = p$, then $m + (k + j) = (m + k) + j = n + j = p$, so $m \le p$. [given, L1]

1.3 A sum is zero only if both summands are: if $k + j = 0$ with $j \ne 0$ then $j = \sigma(i)$ and $k + j = k + \sigma(i) = \sigma(k + i) \ne 0$ [L6], a contradiction, so $k = j = 0$. [L1, L3, L6]

1.4 Total: by trichotomy one of $m < n$, $m = n$, $m > n$ holds, and each of these gives $m \le n$ or $n \le m$. [L4]

2.1 Antisymmetric: if $m \le n$ and $n \le m$, say $m + k = n$ and $n + j = m$, then $m + (k + j) = (m + k) + j = n + j = m = m + 0$; commuting both sides [L5] gives $(k + j) + m = 0 + m$, and cancelling the common right summand $m$ [L2] gives $k + j = 0$, hence $k = j = 0$ by step 1.3 and $m = n$. [given, L1, L2, L5, step 1.3]

3.1 Reflexivity, antisymmetry, transitivity, and totality all hold, so $\le$ is a linear order on $\mathbb{N}$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.1, step 1.4] ∎
