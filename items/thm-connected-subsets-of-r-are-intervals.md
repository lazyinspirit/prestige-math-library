## Statement

Let $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $E$ is connected ([[def-connected-r]]) if and
only if $E$ is **order-convex** ([[def-interval]]), that is, if and only if

$$x, z \in E \text{ and } x \le w \le z \;\Longrightarrow\; w \in E .$$

**On the word "interval".** Order-convexity is exactly the defining property
that [[def-interval]] proves for each of its nine forms, and in that sense the
theorem says that the connected subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ are the intervals. The
converse classification, that every order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty
or one of the nine forms, is true and is explicitly **not proved anywhere in
this library**; [[def-interval]] records that omission in its own remarks. So
the statement proved below is the equivalence with order-convexity, and the
phrase "is an interval" is to be read as "is order-convex" throughout this page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] Separated sets, disconnection, connectedness; separated sets are disjoint ([[def-connected-r]]).

[L2] $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed superset of $A$, so $A \subseteq B$ gives $\overline{A} \subseteq \overline{B}$ and $\overline{A} \subseteq F$ for every closed $F \supseteq A$; and $\overline{A}$ is exactly the set of points every neighbourhood of which meets $A$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]).

[L3] Order-convexity, and the interval forms: $(-\infty,w]$ and $[w,\infty)$ are closed sets, $(-\infty,w)$ and $(w,\infty)$ are open sets, and the order is total and transitive ([[def-interval]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L4] Least-upper-bound property: a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ bounded above has a unique least upper bound ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-sup-unique]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L5] Epsilon characterisation: for nonempty $S$ bounded above and $c = \sup S$, every $\varepsilon > 0$ admits $s \in S$ with $c - \varepsilon < s$ ([[lem-sup-epsilon]]).

[L6] $N_\varepsilon(x) = \{\, y : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L7] Every nonempty finite set of reals has a minimum, which is one of its members ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L8] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 := 1+1 > 0$ and $2^{-1} > 0$; for $d > 0$ one has $0 < d \cdot 2^{-1} < d$; adding a constant preserves an inequality ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Suppose $E$ is not order-convex: there are $x, z \in E$ and $w \in \mathbb{R}$ with $x \le w \le z$ and $w \notin E$; then $w \ne x$ and $w \ne z$, so $x < w < z$. Put $A := E \cap (-\infty,w)$ and $B := E \cap (w,\infty)$; then $x \in A$ and $z \in B$, so both are nonempty, and $A \cup B = E$ because no element of $E$ equals $w$. [assume-hyp, L3]

1.2 Suppose instead that $E$ is order-convex and that $(A,B)$ is a disconnection of $E$; fix $p \in A$ and $q \in B$. Separated sets are disjoint by [L1], so $p \ne q$, and interchanging the names $A$ and $B$ if necessary, which is legitimate because the hypotheses on the pair are symmetric, we may assume $p < q$. [assume-hyp, L1, choose]

1.3 For a nonempty $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ bounded above, $\sup S \in \overline{S}$: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the fact [L5] supplies $s \in S$ with $\sup S - \varepsilon < s \le \sup S$, so $|s - \sup S| < \varepsilon$ and $s \in N_\varepsilon(\sup S) \cap S$; thus every neighbourhood of $\sup S$ meets $S$, and [L2] gives $\sup S \in \overline{S}$. [L2, L4, L5, L6]

2.1 In the situation of step 1.1 the pair $(A,B)$ is a disconnection: $(-\infty,w]$ is a closed set containing $A$, so $\overline{A} \subseteq (-\infty,w]$ by [L2], whence $\overline{A} \cap B \subseteq (-\infty,w] \cap (w,\infty) = \varnothing$; symmetrically $\overline{B} \subseteq [w,\infty)$ and $A \cap \overline{B} = \varnothing$. So $A$ and $B$ are separated, nonempty, and their union is $E$, and $E$ is disconnected. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L3]

2.2 In the situation of step 1.2 put $S := A \cap [p,q]$; it is nonempty because $p \in A$ and $p \le p \le q$, and it is bounded above by $q$, so $c := \sup S$ exists by [L4], and $p \le c \le q$ since $p \in S$ and $q$ is an upper bound. [step 1.2, L3, L4]

3.1 $c \in A$: from $S \subseteq A$ and [L2] we get $\overline{S} \subseteq \overline{A}$, and $c \in \overline{S}$ by step 1.3, so $c \in \overline{A}$ and hence $c \notin B$ because $\overline{A} \cap B = \varnothing$; on the other hand $p \le c \le q$ with $p, q \in E$ and $E$ order-convex gives $c \in E = A \cup B$, so $c \in A$. [step 1.2, step 1.3, step 2.2, L1, L2]

4.1 $c < q$, since $c \in A$ and $q \in B$ are distinct by [L1] while $c \le q$; and every $v$ with $c < v \le q$ lies in $B$: such a $v$ satisfies $p \le c < v \le q$, so $v \in E$ by order-convexity, and $v \notin A$, for otherwise $v \in A \cap [p,q] = S$ would force $v \le c$. [step 1.2, step 2.2, step 3.1, L1, L3]

5.1 $c \in \overline{B}$, which is impossible: given a real $\varepsilon > 0$, put $t := \min\{\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1},\ (q - c) \cdot 2^{-1}\}$, a positive real by [L7] and [L8] since $q - c > 0$, and $v := c + t$; then $c < v$ and $v \le c + (q-c) \cdot 2^{-1} < q$, so $v \in B$ by step 4.1, while $|v - c| = t \le \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} < \varepsilon$, so $v \in N_\varepsilon(c) \cap B$. Hence every neighbourhood of $c$ meets $B$ and $c \in \overline{B}$ by [L2]; but $c \in A$ by step 3.1 and $A \cap \overline{B} = \varnothing$ by [L1]. So the assumed disconnection cannot exist and an order-convex $E$ is connected. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L1, L2, L6, L7, L8]

6.1 Step 2.1 shows that a set which is not order-convex is disconnected, hence a connected set is order-convex; step 5.1 shows that an order-convex set admits no disconnection, hence is connected. The two together are the asserted equivalence. [step 2.1, step 5.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where completeness is spent.** Only in step 2.2, which produces
  $\sup(A \cap [p,q])$; no other step uses the least-upper-bound property, and
  the rest is the order, ordered-field arithmetic and the definition of
  separation. The obstruction over an incomplete ordered field is traceable to
  the failure of that supremum to exist, and it is visible in
  [[cex-rationals-in-an-interval-are-disconnected]]: the set
  $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,2]$ contains all the rationals between its endpoints and is
  nevertheless disconnected as a subset of $\mathbb{R}$, split at an irrational
  point that $\mathbb{Q}$ does not see.

- **The two directions are of different characters.** "Not order-convex implies
  disconnected" is a construction, step 1.1, and needs nothing beyond the order.
  "Order-convex implies connected" is where the work sits, and the supremum
  $c$ produced in step 2.2 is the point at which the two pieces would have to
  meet; the contradiction is that it is adherent to both.

- **The theorem is about subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ and its statement is written in
  order vocabulary**, so it cannot even be stated where no order is present;
  [[rem-r-native-topology-scope]] collects the results on this page with that
  feature.
