## Definition

For $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ write

$$\tfrac{1}{3} S \;:=\; \{\, x \cdot 3^{-1} : x \in S \,\}, \qquad \tfrac{2}{3} + \tfrac{1}{3} S \;:=\; \{\, 2 \cdot 3^{-1} + x \cdot 3^{-1} : x \in S \,\},$$

and let $F : \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}) \to \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})$ be

$$F(S) \;:=\; \tfrac{1}{3} S \ \cup \ \big(\tfrac{2}{3} + \tfrac{1}{3} S\big).$$

By the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]), applied to the set
$\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})$, the starting element $[0,1]$ ([[def-interval]]) and
the function $F$, there is a unique family $(C_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of subsets
of $\mathbb{R}$ with

$$C_0 = [0,1], \qquad C_{n+1} = F(C_n) = \tfrac{1}{3}C_n \cup \big(\tfrac{2}{3} + \tfrac{1}{3}C_n\big) \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

The **Cantor middle-thirds set** is

$$C \;:=\; \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} C_n .$$

**The first step really is the removal of the open middle third.** Directly from
the clauses,

$$C_1 \;=\; \tfrac{1}{3}[0,1] \cup \big(\tfrac{2}{3} + \tfrac{1}{3}[0,1]\big) \;=\; [0, \tfrac13] \cup [\tfrac23, 1] \;=\; [0,1] \setminus (\tfrac13, \tfrac23),$$

the middle equality because $x \mapsto x \cdot 3^{-1}$ is an order isomorphism of
$\mathbb{R}$ onto itself with inverse $x \mapsto 3x$ ([[def-ordered-field]],
[[lem-of-sign-rules]]), and the last because $0 \le x \le 1$ splits, by
totality of the order, into $x \le \tfrac13$, $\tfrac13 < x < \tfrac23$ and
$x \ge \tfrac23$. The recursion then performs the same operation inside each of
the two scaled copies, which is what "removing the open middle thirds" names.

**Every $C_n$ lies in $[0,1]$**, by induction on $n$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]):
$C_0 = [0,1]$; and if $C_n \subseteq [0,1]$ then $\tfrac13 C_n \subseteq [0,\tfrac13]$
and $\tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C_n \subseteq [\tfrac23, 1]$, so
$C_{n+1} \subseteq [0,1]$ ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]]). The same
computation shows that **the two halves of $C_{n+1}$ are disjoint**, the first
lying in $[0,\tfrac13]$ and the second in $[\tfrac23,1]$, and $\tfrac13 < \tfrac23$
([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

**The family is nested**, $C_{n+1} \subseteq C_n$ for every $n$, again by
induction. For $n = 0$ this is $C_1 = [0,\tfrac13] \cup [\tfrac23,1] \subseteq
[0,1]$. And $F$ is monotone, in the sense that $S \subseteq T$ implies
$F(S) \subseteq F(T)$, directly from the displayed description of $F$; so
$C_{n+1} \subseteq C_n$ gives $C_{n+2} = F(C_{n+1}) \subseteq F(C_n) = C_{n+1}$.
Consequently $C = \bigcap_n C_n \subseteq C_m$ for every $m$, and
$\bigcap_n C_{n+1} = \bigcap_n C_n = C$.

**Powers.** Here $3^{-n}$ means $(3^{-1})^n$, the integer power of
[[def-integer-power]], so that $3^{0} = 1$, $3^{-(n+1)} \cdot 3 = 3^{-n}$ and
$3^{-n} > 0$ for every $n$ ([[lem-power-laws]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Remarks

- **Why the self-similar recursion rather than a description by digits.** The
  clause $C_{n+1} = F(C_n)$ is a single application of [[thm-recursion]] to one
  explicitly given function on $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})$, so nothing is selected
  at any stage and no listing of the $2^n$ intervals making up $C_n$ has to be
  constructed. Every structural property below is then proved by induction on
  $n$ through $F$. The description by ternary digits is a theorem about $C$, not
  its definition, and it is [[thm-cantor-set-ternary-description]].

- **$C$ is not empty.** $0 \in C_n$ for every $n$, by induction:
  $0 \in [0,1]$, and $0 \in C_n$ gives $0 = 0 \cdot 3^{-1} \in \tfrac13 C_n
  \subseteq C_{n+1}$. Likewise $1 \in C$, since $1 \in C_n$ gives
  $1 = \tfrac23 + 1 \cdot \tfrac13 \in C_{n+1}$. So $C$ contains at least the two
  endpoints; that it is in fact uncountable is
  [[thm-cantor-set-properties]].

- **The construction with a different proportion.** Replacing "middle third" by
  an interval of length $4^{-n}$ removed at stage $n$ produces a set that is
  closed, has empty interior and is *not* of measure zero
  ([[def-fat-cantor-set]]). So none of the qualitative properties of $C$ proved
  on this page is a consequence of its being nowhere dense, and the two
  constructions are kept apart deliberately.
