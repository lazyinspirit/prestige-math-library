## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]), with
open covers, subcovers, finiteness and compactness as in [[def-compact-space]],
and *finite*, *at most countable* and *uncountable* as in [[def-countable]].

- $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is **countably compact** when every open cover of $X$ that
  is at most countable has a finite subcover.
- $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is **Lindel&ouml;f** when every open cover of $X$ has an at
  most countable subcover.
- $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is **sequentially compact** when every sequence $(x_k)$ in
  $X$, that is every function $x : \mathbb{N} \to X$
  ([[def-sequence-convergence-top]]), has a subsequence $(x_{n_j})$ converging to
  a point of $X$, the index map $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ being strictly
  increasing ([[def-sequence]], [[lem-index-map-grows]]).
- $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is **limit point compact** when every infinite subset
  $A \subseteq X$ has a limit point in $X$, that is a point $p \in X$ every
  neighbourhood $N$ of which satisfies $N \cap (A \setminus \{p\}) \ne \varnothing$
  ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]). Here *infinite* means not finite in
  the sense of [[def-countable]].
- $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is **$\sigma$-compact** when there is an at most countable
  family $\mathcal{K}$ of compact subsets of $X$ with $X = \bigcup \mathcal{K}$.
- A subset $A \subseteq X$ is **relatively compact in $X$** when its closure
  $\overline{A}$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]) is a compact subset of
  $X$.

A subset $A \subseteq X$ is called countably compact, Lindel&ouml;f,
sequentially compact, limit point compact or $\sigma$-compact when the subspace
$(A, \mathcal{T}_A)$ is ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]), exactly as for
compactness. **Relative compactness is the exception and is deliberately not of
that form**: it is a statement about $A$ *inside* $X$, since $\overline{A}$ is
computed in $X$, and a set may be relatively compact in one space and not in
another that contains it. Every other notion on this list is intrinsic to the
subspace.

**The countable covers may be listed.** A nonempty at most countable family
$\mathcal{U}$ admits a surjection $\mathbb{N} \to \mathcal{U}$
([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]]), so countable compactness says: for
every sequence $(U_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of open sets with
$X = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} U_n$ there are finitely many indices whose sets
already cover $X$. That surjection is produced from the countability assumption
alone and no choice principle is involved; the empty family covers only the empty
space, which is compact anyway.

**Indexing starts at $0$.** A sequence here is a function on $\mathbb{N}$ and
$\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$ ([[def-sequence]]), so a subsequence is
$(x_{n_j})_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ with $n_0 < n_1 < \cdots$ and $n_j \ge j$
([[lem-index-map-grows]]). An index range taken from a text that starts at $1$
must be shifted before it is used here.

**Agreement with the metric definitions.** Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space carrying
its metric topology $\mathcal{T}_d$ ([[def-metric-topology]],
[[def-metrizable-space]]). Then the three notions that
[[def-metric-compactness-variants]] defines metrically are the three defined
above, read in $(X, \mathcal{T}_d)$:

- *Countably compact.* The open sets used there are the members of
  $\mathcal{T}_d$, so the at most countable open covers are the same families and
  the condition is the same condition, exactly as for compactness itself
  ([[thm-compactness-agrees-with-metric-compactness]]).
- *Sequentially compact.* Convergence of a sequence in the metric sense and in
  the sense of [[def-sequence-convergence-top]] agree on a metric topology,
  because the balls around a point are a neighbourhood base at it
  ([[def-metrizable-space]]); the subsequences quantified over are the same.
- *Limit point compact.* A point $p$ is a limit point of $A$ in the metric sense
  when every ball around $p$ meets $A \setminus \{p\}$, and in the sense above
  when every neighbourhood does; the same neighbourhood base makes the two
  conditions one ([[def-metrizable-space]],
  [[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

So no statement below about a metrizable space introduces a second notion, and
every theorem of the metric development about these three properties may be
quoted here once a metric inducing the topology is named. Lindel&ouml;fness,
$\sigma$-compactness and relative compactness have no metric counterpart in this
library and are defined here for the first time.

## Remarks

**None of the conditions listed above is compactness by definition.** Countable
compactness restricts the covers tested; Lindel&ouml;fness weakens the conclusion
from finite to at most countable; sequential compactness speaks about sequences
instead of covers; limit point compactness speaks about subsets;
$\sigma$-compactness asks only that the space be assembled from at most countably
many compact pieces; relative compactness is a condition on a subset of an
ambient space. Which implications hold between them, and which need a choice
principle, is [[thm-compactness-variants-hierarchy]]; that some of them fail
to be equivalent is witnessed by the false statements at the end of this page.

**Why $\sigma$-compactness is not a compactness property at all.** The real line
is $\sigma$-compact, being the union of the compact intervals $[-n, n]$, and it is
not compact; the definition is useful precisely because it names a class of
spaces built out of compact pieces without being compact. The same remark
explains why a $\sigma$-compact space need not be countably compact.

**Limit point compactness is sometimes called the Bolzano-Weierstrass
property**, and *countably compact* is occasionally used for what is called limit
point compact here. This library uses the four names above with the meanings
given, and writes the condition out whenever the risk of confusion is real.
