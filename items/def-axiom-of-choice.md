## Definition

The **Axiom of Choice** (AC) is the following statement.

> Every family of nonempty sets has a choice function
> ([[def-choice-function]]).

Written out: for every set $\mathcal{F}$ all of whose members are nonempty,
there exists a function $g$ with domain $\mathcal{F}$ satisfying $g(S) \in S$ for
all $S \in \mathcal{F}$.

An equivalent formulation is that a product of nonempty sets is nonempty: if
$X_i \ne \emptyset$ for every $i \in I$, then $\prod_{i \in I} X_i \ne \emptyset$.
Here $\prod_{i \in I} X_i$ is the set of functions $f$ with domain $I$ such that
$f(i) \in X_i$ for every $i \in I$; when a family of nonempty sets is indexed by
itself, such an $f$ is precisely a choice function for it.

## Remarks

- **This is an axiom, not a theorem, and it is deliberately not derived here.**
  **Assume ZF is consistent.** Then AC is independent of the axioms of
  Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory: Gödel (1938) showed that ZF, if consistent, cannot
  refute it ([[rem-godel-constructible-universe]]), and Cohen (1963) showed that
  ZF, if consistent, cannot prove it ([[rem-cohen-forcing-ac-independent]]). The
  consistency hypothesis is not decoration and cannot be dropped: an inconsistent
  ZF proves everything, AC included, so both halves of the independence would
  fail. Nor can the hypothesis be discharged inside ZF. Both directions also
  require machinery (the constructible universe and forcing) that this library
  does not yet contain, so both are recorded with references rather than proved.
  [[fs-zorn-provable-in-zf]] carries the same consistency assumption explicitly
  in its Given; [[rem-choice-ledger]] records the weaker choice principles.
- Being an axiom, AC carries no well-definedness obligation, which is why this
  item has no `justified_by`.
- The case of a family listed by a natural number, which is the finite case once
  finiteness is defined, is a theorem of ZF and needs no axiom
  ([[lem-finite-choice]]). AC is exactly the extension of that theorem to
  arbitrary index sets, and the gap between the two is not a matter of degree:
  [[ex-russells-socks]] exhibits the difference concretely.
- "ZFC" abbreviates ZF together with AC. A result that invokes AC should say so
  where it is stated, so that a reader can tell which theorems are choice-free;
  that bookkeeping is the purpose of [[rem-choice-ledger]].
  [[rem-choice-strengths]] carries the narrower question of what the ultrafilter
  lemma costs, and on cited authority, and under the hypothesis that ZF is
  consistent, places that principle strictly between ZF and AC.
