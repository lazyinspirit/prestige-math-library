## Statement

Let $D$ be the set of sequences $a : \mathbb{N} \to \{0,2\}$
([[def-sequence]]), the two values being the real numbers $0$ and $2$. For
$a \in D$ the series $\sum_{k \ge 0} a_k 3^{-k-1}$ converges ([[def-series]]);
write

$$\Phi(a) \;:=\; \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k 3^{-k-1} .$$

Then, with $C$ and $(C_n)$ as in [[def-cantor-set]]:

1. $\Phi(a) \in [0,1]$ for every $a \in D$, and $C = \{\, \Phi(a) : a \in D \,\}$;
2. $\Phi$ is injective, so $\Phi$ is a bijection from $D$ onto $C$
   ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]);
3. consequently $b \mapsto \Phi\big((2 b_k)_k\big)$ is a bijection from
   $\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$, the set of sequences with values in $\{0,1\}$, onto
   $C$;
4. $C = \tfrac13 C \cup \big(\tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C\big)$, and the two sets on the
   right are disjoint.

**On the indexing.** The digit $a_k$ carries the weight $3^{-k-1}$, so the
series starts at $k = 0$ with the term $a_0/3$; written with the classical
$1$-based index it reads $\sum_{k \ge 1} a_k 3^{-k}$, which is the form in the
title. Sequences in this library are functions on $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}$
contains $0$ ([[def-sequence]]), so the $0$-based form is the one used
throughout the proof.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The sets $C_n$ and $C$ of [[def-cantor-set]], the set $D$ of sequences with values in $\{0,2\}$, and for $a \in D$ the shifted sequence $\sigma a$ defined by $(\sigma a)_k := a_{k+1}$, which again lies in $D$.

[L1] The Cantor set: $C_0 = [0,1]$, $C_{n+1} = \tfrac13 C_n \cup (\tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C_n)$, $C = \bigcap_n C_n = \bigcap_n C_{n+1}$, every $C_n \subseteq [0,1]$, the two halves of $C_{n+1}$ lie in $[0,\tfrac13]$ and in $[\tfrac23,1]$ respectively and are disjoint, and $3^{-n}$ denotes $(3^{-1})^n$ ([[def-cantor-set]], [[def-interval]]).

[L2] Series: partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} t_k$, convergence of $(s_n)$, the sum as its limit, the tail clause $\sum_{k \ge m} t_k$ and the identity $\sum_{k<n+1} t_k = t_0 + \sum_{j<n} t_{j+1}$ ([[def-series]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L3] A series of nonnegative terms converges exactly when its partial sums are bounded above, its sum is then their supremum, every partial sum is at most the sum, and a convergent series of nonnegative terms has sum $\ge 0$ ([[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]]).

[L4] $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} 3^{-k} = 1/(1 - 3^{-1}) = 3 \cdot 2^{-1}$ ([[thm-geometric-series]], [[def-integer-power]], [[lem-power-laws]]).

[L5] Convergent series add and scale termwise ([[lem-series-linearity]]).

[L6] Recursion and induction on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-recursion]], [[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L7] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L8] $3^{-n} \to 0$ ([[lem-geometric-sequence-null]]); convergence is tested against rational $\varepsilon > 0$ and a convergent sequence has exactly one limit ([[def-real-limit]], [[lem-limit-unique]]); $|z| \ge 0$ and $|z| = z$ for $z \ge 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L9] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 > 0$ and $3 > 0$ and $3^{-1} > 0$, and $3^{-1} < 2 \cdot 3^{-1}$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve an inequality; the order is total and transitive ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **$\Phi$ is well defined and takes values in $[0,1]$.** For $a \in D$ every term $a_k 3^{-k-1}$ is $\ge 0$ by [L1] and [L9], and for every $n$ the partial sum satisfies $\sum_{k<n} a_k 3^{-k-1} \le \sum_{k<n} 2 \cdot 3^{-1} \cdot 3^{-k} = 2 \cdot 3^{-1} \sum_{k<n} 3^{-k} \le 2 \cdot 3^{-1} \cdot 3 \cdot 2^{-1} = 1$, by [L3], [L4] and [L9]. So by [L3] the series converges, its sum $\Phi(a)$ satisfies $0 \le \Phi(a) \le 1$, and $\Phi(a) \in [0,1]$ by [L1]. [given, L1, L3, L4, L9]

1.2 **Shift identity:** $\Phi(a) = a_0 \cdot 3^{-1} + 3^{-1}\Phi(\sigma a)$ for every $a \in D$. Indeed by [L2] the partial sums satisfy $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k 3^{-k-1} = a_0 3^{-1} + \sum_{j<n} a_{j+1} 3^{-j-2} = a_0 3^{-1} + 3^{-1}\sum_{j<n} a_{j+1}3^{-j-1}$, using $3^{-j-2} = 3^{-1}\cdot 3^{-j-1}$ from [L1] and [L9]; letting $n$ grow and using [L5] and [L2] gives the identity. [given, L1, L2, L5, L9]

1.3 **Self-similarity of $C$**, claim 4. If $y \in C$ then $y \in C_n$ for every $n$, so $y \cdot 3^{-1} \in \tfrac13 C_n \subseteq C_{n+1}$ and $2 \cdot 3^{-1} + y \cdot 3^{-1} \in \tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C_n \subseteq C_{n+1}$ for every $n$, whence both lie in $\bigcap_n C_{n+1} = C$ by [L1]; this gives the inclusion $\supseteq$. Conversely let $x \in C$, so $x \in C_{n+1}$ for every $n$. By [L1] the first half of $C_{n+1}$ lies in $[0,\tfrac13]$ and the second in $[\tfrac23,1]$, and $\tfrac13 < \tfrac23$ by [L9]. If $x \le \tfrac13$ then $x \notin [\tfrac23,1]$, so for every $n$ one has $x \in \tfrac13 C_n$, that is $3x \in C_n$; hence $3x \in C$ and $x \in \tfrac13 C$. If $x > \tfrac13$ then $x \notin [0,\tfrac13]$, so for every $n$ one has $x \in \tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C_n$, that is $3x - 2 \in C_n$; hence $3x - 2 \in C$ and $x \in \tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C$. Disjointness is [L1] and [L9], since $\tfrac13 C \subseteq [0,\tfrac13]$ and $\tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C \subseteq [\tfrac23,1]$. [L1, L9]

2.1 **$\Phi(a) \in C$ for every $a \in D$.** By induction on $n$ ([L6]) the statement "for every $a \in D$, $\Phi(a) \in C_n$" holds for every $n$: at $n = 0$ it is step 1.1 and [L1]; and if it holds at $n$, then for $a \in D$ the value $a_0$ is $0$ or $2$, so step 1.2 gives $\Phi(a) = 3^{-1}\Phi(\sigma a) \in \tfrac13 C_n$ in the first case and $\Phi(a) = 2 \cdot 3^{-1} + 3^{-1}\Phi(\sigma a) \in \tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C_n$ in the second, so $\Phi(a) \in C_{n+1}$ by [L1]. Hence $\Phi(a) \in \bigcap_n C_n = C$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1, L6]

2.2 **The digit recursion.** Fix $x \in C$ and let $T : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be $T(y) := 3y$ for $y \le 3^{-1}$ and $T(y) := 3y - 2$ for $y > 3^{-1}$, a definition by cases on the total order ([L9]) and so a genuine function. By [L6] there is $y : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with $y_0 = x$ and $y_{n+1} = T(y_n)$; put $a_n := 0$ when $y_n \le 3^{-1}$ and $a_n := 2$ otherwise, so that $a \in D$ and $y_{n+1} = 3 y_n - a_n$ for every $n$. Every $y_n$ lies in $C$, by induction on $n$: $y_0 = x \in C$; and if $y_n \in C$ then, by step 1.3, either $y_n \in \tfrac13 C \subseteq [0,\tfrac13]$ or $y_n \in \tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C \subseteq [\tfrac23,1]$, and these two cases are exactly $y_n \le \tfrac13$ and $y_n > \tfrac13$ by [L9]; in the first $y_n = z \cdot 3^{-1}$ with $z \in C$ and $y_{n+1} = 3y_n = z \in C$, in the second $y_n = 2 \cdot 3^{-1} + z \cdot 3^{-1}$ with $z \in C$ and $y_{n+1} = 3y_n - 2 = z \in C$. [step 1.3, L1, L6, L9]

2.3 **$\Phi$ is injective.** Let $a, b \in D$ with $a \ne b$; the set of $k$ with $a_k \ne b_k$ is a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$, so by [L7] it has a least element $k$, and by symmetry we may take $a_k = 0$ and $b_k = 2$. By [L5], $\Phi(b) - \Phi(a) = \sum_{j \ge 0}(b_j - a_j)3^{-j-1}$, and the terms with $j < k$ vanish, so by [L2] this equals $2 \cdot 3^{-k-1} + R$ with $R := \sum_{j \ge k+1}(b_j - a_j)3^{-j-1}$. Every $b_j - a_j$ is at least $-2$, so the series $\sum_{j \ge k+1}\big((b_j - a_j) + 2\big)3^{-j-1}$ has nonnegative terms and hence nonnegative sum by [L3], giving $R \ge -\sum_{j \ge k+1} 2 \cdot 3^{-j-1} = -2 \cdot 3^{-k-2} \cdot 3 \cdot 2^{-1} = -3^{-k-1}$ by [L2], [L4], [L5] and [L9]. Therefore $\Phi(b) - \Phi(a) \ge 2 \cdot 3^{-k-1} - 3^{-k-1} = 3^{-k-1} > 0$ and $\Phi(a) \ne \Phi(b)$. [step 1.1, L2, L3, L4, L5, L7, L9]

3.1 **The value is recovered from the digits.** With $x$, $(y_n)$ and $a$ as in step 2.2, put $s_n := \sum_{k<n} a_k 3^{-k-1}$. Then $x = s_n + 3^{-n} y_n$ for every $n$, by induction on $n$ ([L6]): at $n = 0$ both sides are $x$, since $s_0 = 0$ by [L2] and $3^{0} = 1$; and if $x = s_n + 3^{-n}y_n$ then $s_{n+1} + 3^{-n-1}y_{n+1} = s_n + a_n 3^{-n-1} + 3^{-n-1}(3y_n - a_n) = s_n + 3^{-n}y_n = x$, using [L1], [L2] and [L9]. [step 2.2, L1, L2, L6, L9]

4.1 **Hence $x = \Phi(a)$, so $C \subseteq \Phi[D]$.** Every $y_n$ lies in $C \subseteq [0,1]$ by step 2.2 and [L1], so $0 \le x - s_n = 3^{-n}y_n \le 3^{-n}$ by step 3.1 and [L9]. Given a rational $\varepsilon > 0$, [L8] supplies $N$ with $3^{-n} < \varepsilon$ for all $n \ge N$, and then $|s_n - x| = x - s_n \le 3^{-n} < \varepsilon$ by [L8]; so $s_n \to x$. But $s_n \to \Phi(a)$ by [L2], since $(s_n)$ is the sequence of partial sums of the series defining $\Phi(a)$, and limits are unique by [L8]; therefore $x = \Phi(a)$ with $a \in D$. [step 2.2, step 3.1, L1, L2, L8, L9]

5.1 By steps 2.1 and 4.1 the image of $D$ under $\Phi$ is exactly $C$, which with step 1.1 is claim 1; step 2.3 is claim 2, so $\Phi$ is a surjection from $D$ onto $C$ that is injective, that is, a bijection ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]); the map $b \mapsto (2b_k)_k$ is a bijection from $\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$ onto $D$, with inverse $a \mapsto (a_k \cdot 2^{-1})_k$ by [L9], and a composition of bijections is a bijection, which is claim 3; and step 1.3 is claim 4. [step 1.1, step 1.3, step 2.1, step 2.3, step 4.1, L9] ∎

## Remarks

- **The endpoints are the digit sequences that are eventually constant.** For
  instance $0 = \Phi(0,0,0,\dots)$, $1 = \Phi(2,2,2,\dots)$,
  $\tfrac13 = \Phi(0,2,2,2,\dots)$ and $\tfrac23 = \Phi(2,0,0,0,\dots)$, the
  first two by [[thm-geometric-series]] and the last two by the shift identity of
  step 1.2. That the eventually constant sequences do **not** exhaust $C$ is the
  content of [[cex-cantor-point-that-is-not-an-endpoint]], where $1/4$ is
  computed to be $\Phi(0,2,0,2,\dots)$.

- **No digit is ever $1$, and that is the whole point.** A real of $[0,1]$ with a
  ternary expansion using the digit $1$ at some place and not representable
  without it lies in one of the removed middle thirds. The theorem does not
  assert that every real has a ternary expansion, and it does not need to: the
  map $\Phi$ is constructed from the digits, and the converse direction extracts
  digits from a point of $C$ by the canonical recursion of step 2.2, never by
  invoking a general expansion theorem.

- **Where the choice-freeness lies.** The digit extraction is a definition by
  cases on a total order fed to [[thm-recursion]], so the whole passage from a
  point of $C$ to its digit sequence is a single function, not a sequence of
  selections. The same discipline governs [[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]] and
  [[thm-baire-category-r]].

- **Claim 3 is what makes $C$ uncountable.** $\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$ is in
  bijection with the power set of $\mathbb{N}$, which is uncountable by
  [[thm-cantor-powerset]]; that route and the perfect-set route are both recorded
  in [[thm-cantor-set-properties]].
