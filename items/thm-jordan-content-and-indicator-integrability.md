## Statement

A metric-bounded set $E\subseteq\mathbb R^m$ is Jordan measurable if and only
if its indicator $1_E$ is Riemann integrable on a fixed nondegenerate bounding
rectangle $Q$. In that case
$$\int_Q1_E=\operatorname{cont}(E).$$

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Metric-bounded $E\subseteq Q$ in the sense of [[def-metric-bounded-diameter]], where $Q$ is a nondegenerate bounding rectangle.

[L1] Jordan inner and outer content are [[def-jordan-inner-and-outer-content]].

[L2] Multidimensional Darboux sums and integrability are [[def-multidimensional-darboux-sums]], [[def-multidimensional-darboux-integral]], and [[thm-multidimensional-riemann-criterion]].

[L3] A finite rectangle cover can be converted to grid cells meeting $E$ with arbitrarily small excess volume ([[lem-finite-cube-covers-admit-grid-control]]), and rectangles are finite coordinate products ([[def-multidimensional-rectangle-and-volume]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 On a grid cell, the infimum of $1_E$ is $1$ exactly when the cell is contained in $E$, while its supremum is $1$ exactly when the cell meets $E$. Thus lower and upper sums are inscribed and covering grid approximations.  [L1, L2]

2.1 Apply [L3] to each finite outer rectangle approximation to obtain a grid whose cells meeting $E$ have arbitrarily small excess volume. For an inner approximation, shrink each nondegenerate inscribed rectangle by an arbitrarily small volume, insert the shrunken endpoints, and retain the grid cells inside it. Degenerate rectangles contribute zero. Splitting along the aligned endpoints shows that arbitrary Jordan approximations and grid approximations have the same infimum and supremum. [step 1.1, L3, given]

3.1 Equality of Jordan contents is therefore equality of the lower and upper integrals on the fixed bounding rectangle, and their common value is $\operatorname{cont}(E)$.   [step 2.1, L1, L2, given] ∎
