## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ be a monotone sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]],
[[def-monotone-sequence]]). Then $(x_k)$ converges if and only if it is bounded,
that is if and only if there is $M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for every
$k \in \mathbb{N}$.

The forward implication holds for every sequence and is
[[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]]. What monotonicity buys is the converse, which
is false for sequences in general.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A monotone sequence $(x_k)$ of reals, with range $S = \{x_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$.

[L1] Monotone means nondecreasing or nonincreasing ([[def-monotone-sequence]]).

[L2] Monotone convergence: a nondecreasing sequence whose range is bounded above converges, to the supremum of its range; a nonincreasing sequence whose range is bounded below converges, to the infimum ([[thm-monotone-convergence]]).

[L3] Every convergent sequence of reals is bounded ([[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]]).

[L4] A sequence is bounded when some $M$ satisfies $|x_k| \le M$ for every $k$; its range is bounded above by $u$ when $x_k \le u$ for every $k$, and bounded below by $\ell$ when $\ell \le x_k$ for every $k$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L5] Absolute value: $|t| \le M$ exactly when $-M \le t \le M$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Suppose $(x_k)$ converges. Then it is bounded by [L3], and this direction uses neither the monotonicity hypothesis nor any case distinction. [given, L3]

1.2 Suppose instead that $(x_k)$ is bounded, and fix $M$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for every $k$; then $-M \le x_k \le M$ for every $k$, so the range $S$ is bounded above by $M$ and bounded below by $-M$. [given, L4, L5, assume-hyp]

2.1 If $(x_k)$ is nondecreasing then its range is bounded above by step 1.2, so $(x_k)$ converges, to $\sup S$. [step 1.2, L2, assume-case nondec]

2.2 If $(x_k)$ is nonincreasing then its range is bounded below by step 1.2, so $(x_k)$ converges, to $\inf S$. [step 1.2, L2, assume-case noninc]

3.1 A monotone sequence is nondecreasing or nonincreasing, so those two cases exhaust the hypothesis, and in both a bounded monotone sequence converges. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L1, cases: nondecreasing or nonincreasing, cases-exhaustive]

4.1 Both directions are established: a monotone sequence converges if and only if it is bounded. [step 1.1, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The limit is named, not merely asserted to exist.** In the nondecreasing case
  it is $\sup S$ and in the nonincreasing case $\inf S$, by
  [[thm-monotone-convergence]]. The equivalence is stated without the value only
  because the value depends on which of the two cases holds.

- **This is the form in which the result is used.** Bolzano-Weierstrass
  ([[thm-bolzano-weierstrass]]) extracts a monotone subsequence of a bounded
  sequence and then needs exactly this corollary, since what is available about
  the subsequence is boundedness, inherited from the sequence, and not a bound on
  a particular side.

- **Neither hypothesis can be dropped.** Without monotonicity the converse
  direction fails, by [[fs-bounded-implies-convergent]]. Without boundedness the
  forward direction is what fails, and it fails in the describable way recorded
  by [[lem-monotone-unbounded-diverges]]: a nondecreasing unbounded sequence
  diverges to $+\infty$.
