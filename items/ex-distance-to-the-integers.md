## Example

Identify $\mathbb{Z}$ with its canonical copy in $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-integers]], [[lem-int-embeds-rat]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) and for
$x \in \mathbb{R}$ put

$$D(x) \;:=\; \{\, |x - n| \ : \ n \in \mathbb{Z} \,\}, \qquad \psi(x) \;:=\; \inf D(x)$$

([[def-infimum]]). Write $m := \lfloor x \rfloor$ for the integer part of $x$
([[lem-integer-part]]) and $t := x - m$, so $0 \le t < 1$. Then:

1. **Existence and attainment.** $\psi(x)$ exists and is **attained**:
   $$\psi(x) \;=\; \min\{\, t,\ 1 - t \,\} \;=\; \min\bigl\{\, |x - m|,\ |x - (m+1)| \,\bigr\} ,$$
   so $\psi(x) = |x - n|$ for $n = m$ or $n = m + 1$, and $\psi(x) = \min D(x)$
   ([[def-max-min]]).
2. **Range.** $0 \le \psi(x) \le 1/2$ for every real $x$, and every value in
   $[0, 1/2]$ occurs: the range of $\psi$ is exactly the interval $[0, 1/2]$
   ([[def-interval]]).
3. **Zero set.** $\psi(x) = 0$ if and only if $x \in \mathbb{Z}$.
4. **Half-integers.** $\psi(m + 1/2) = 1/2$ for every $m \in \mathbb{Z}$.
5. **Periodicity.** $\psi(x + 1) = \psi(x)$ for every real $x$.

**What this function is for.** It is the elementary, trigonometry-free
substitute for $\sin$: it is bounded, it oscillates, and on every punctured
neighbourhood of $0$ the composite $\psi(1/x)$ attains both the value $0$ and the
value $1/2$. Claims 3 and 4 are exactly what the companion counterexample
[[cex-psi-of-one-over-x-has-no-limit-at-zero]] evaluates, and claim 2 is what the
squeeze argument of [[ex-x-times-psi-tends-to-zero]] uses.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real $x$; the set $D(x) = \{\, |x - n| : n \in \mathbb{Z} \,\}$; the integer $m := \lfloor x \rfloor$ and the real $t := x - m$. Integers are identified with their canonical copies in $\mathbb{R}$.

[L1] Integer part: for every real $x$ there is exactly one integer $m$ with $m \le x < m + 1$ ([[lem-integer-part]]). Hence $0 \le t < 1$ and $0 < 1 - t \le 1$, where $1 - t = (m+1) - x$.

[L2] Integers in $\mathbb{R}$: the embeddings $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$ are injective and preserve $0$, $1$, addition and order; $\mathbb{Z}$ is a totally ordered commutative ring, closed under $n \mapsto n + 1$ and $n \mapsto n - 1$; every integer $\ge 0$ is the image of a unique natural; and a natural $j \ne 0$ satisfies $j \ge 1$, so an integer $> 0$ is $\ge 1$ and consequently, for integers $n < n'$, one has $n + 1 \le n'$ ([[def-integers]], [[lem-nat-embeds-int]], [[lem-int-embeds-rat]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]], [[thm-int-ordered-ring]], [[thm-int-comm-ring]], [[lem-nat-discrete]], [[def-natural-numbers]]).

[L3] Infimum: $\ell = \inf S$ when $\ell \le s$ for every $s \in S$ and $\ell' \le \ell$ for every lower bound $\ell'$ of $S$. So a lower bound of $S$ that belongs to $S$ is the infimum, and is then also the minimum of $S$ ([[def-infimum]], [[def-max-min]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L4] Absolute value: $|u| \ge 0$; $|u| = 0$ exactly when $u = 0$; $|u| = u$ for $u \ge 0$ and $|u| = -u$ for $u \le 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]]).

[L5] Order and field arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: the order is total and trichotomy holds; translation invariance and adding inequalities ([[lem-of-add-order]]); $0 < 1$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]), so $2 > 0$, $1/2 > 0$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]), $1/2 < 1$ and $1 - 1/2 = 1/2$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-field]]); and the minimum of a two-element set of reals ([[def-max-min]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Verification

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $D(x)$ is nonempty and $0$ is a lower bound of it: the integer $0$ gives $|x - 0| \in D(x)$, and $|x - n| \ge 0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. [L2, L4]

1.2 By [L1] the integer $m = \lfloor x \rfloor$ satisfies $m \le x < m + 1$, so $t = x - m$ satisfies $0 \le t < 1$, and $(m+1) - x = 1 - t$ satisfies $0 < 1 - t \le 1$. [L1, L5]

2.1 Every element of $D(x)$ is at least $\min\{t, 1-t\}$. Let $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. By [L2] and totality either $n \le m$ or $m < n$, and in the second case $m + 1 \le n$. If $n \le m$ then $x - n \ge x - m = t \ge 0$, so $|x - n| = x - n \ge t$. If $m + 1 \le n$ then $n - x \ge (m+1) - x = 1 - t > 0$, so $|x - n| = n - x \ge 1 - t$. In both cases $|x - n| \ge \min\{t, 1-t\}$. [step 1.2, L2, L4, L5]

2.2 Both $t$ and $1 - t$ belong to $D(x)$: since $t \ge 0$ we have $t = |x - m|$, and since $1 - t > 0$ we have $1 - t = |x - (m+1)|$, with $m$ and $m+1$ in $\mathbb{Z}$. [step 1.2, L2, L4]

3.1 Hence $\min\{t, 1-t\}$ is a lower bound of $D(x)$ belonging to $D(x)$, so by [L3] it is the greatest lower bound and also the minimum: $\psi(x) = \min\{t, 1-t\} = \min\{|x - m|, |x - (m+1)|\}$, attained at $n = m$ or at $n = m+1$. This is claim 1. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L3, L5]

4.1 Claim 2, the inclusion. $\psi(x) \ge 0$, since $t \ge 0$ and $1 - t > 0$; and $\psi(x) \le 1/2$: if $t \le 1/2$ then $\psi(x) \le t \le 1/2$, while if $1/2 < t$ then $1 - t < 1 - 1/2 = 1/2$ and $\psi(x) \le 1 - t < 1/2$. So $0 \le \psi(x) \le 1/2$ for every real $x$. [step 1.2, step 3.1, L5]

4.2 Claim 3. If $\psi(x) = 0$ then $\min\{t, 1-t\} = 0$; since $1 - t > 0$ this forces $t = 0$, that is $x = m \in \mathbb{Z}$. Conversely if $x \in \mathbb{Z}$ then $|x - x| = 0$ lies in $D(x)$ and $0$ is a lower bound of $D(x)$ by step 1.1, so $\psi(x) = 0$ by [L3]. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 3.1, L3, L4, L5]

4.3 Claim 4. Let $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $x := m + 1/2$. Since $0 < 1/2 < 1$ we have $m \le x < m + 1$, so the uniqueness in [L1] gives $\lfloor x \rfloor = m$ and $t = 1/2$; then step 3.1 gives $\psi(x) = \min\{1/2,\ 1 - 1/2\} = \min\{1/2, 1/2\} = 1/2$. [step 3.1, L1, L5]

4.4 Claim 5. The map $n \mapsto n + 1$ is a bijection of $\mathbb{Z}$ onto itself, with inverse $n \mapsto n - 1$ [L2]; so, substituting $n = n' + 1$, $$D(x+1) = \{\, |(x+1) - n| : n \in \mathbb{Z} \,\} = \{\, |x - n'| : n' \in \mathbb{Z} \,\} = D(x) .$$ Being infima of the same set, $\psi(x+1)$ and $\psi(x)$ are equal by step 3.1 applied at $x + 1$ and at $x$. [step 3.1, L2, L3]

5.1 Claim 2, the exact range. Every value of $\psi$ lies in $[0,1/2]$ by step 4.1. Conversely let $s$ satisfy $0 \le s \le 1/2$; then $0 \le s < 1$, so $0 \le s < 0 + 1$ and the uniqueness in [L1] gives $\lfloor s \rfloor = 0$ and $t = s$; and $s \le 1/2 \le 1 - s$ because $2s \le 1$, so step 3.1 gives $\psi(s) = \min\{s, 1-s\} = s$. Hence the range of $\psi$ is exactly $[0,1/2]$. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L1, L5]

6.1 So $\psi$ is defined at every real, is attained at a nearest integer, has range exactly $[0,1/2]$, vanishes exactly on $\mathbb{Z}$, takes the value $1/2$ at every half-integer, and is $1$-periodic. [step 3.1, step 4.1, step 4.2, step 4.3, step 4.4, step 5.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **No completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ is needed for the infimum here.** The general existence theorem [[thm-infimum-property]] would supply $\inf D(x)$ from the least-upper-bound property, but step 3.1 does not use it: the infimum is produced by exhibiting an element of $D(x)$ that is also a lower bound, which is [[def-infimum]] read directly. Completeness does enter, once, through [[lem-integer-part]], whose existence half is the Archimedean property.

- **Why $\min\{t, 1-t\}$ and not "the distance to the nearest integer".** The phrase presupposes that a nearest integer exists, which is exactly what step 2.2 establishes and what the picture cannot. When $t = 1/2$ there are two nearest integers, $m$ and $m+1$, and the formula is indifferent to which is chosen, so nothing has to be selected.

- **$\psi$ is the sawtooth-shaped triangle wave** of amplitude $1/2$ and period $1$: on $[0, 1/2]$ it is $\psi(s) = s$ by step 5.1, and periodicity and the reflection $\psi(-x) = \psi(x)$ — immediate from $D(-x) = \{\, |-x - n| : n \in \mathbb{Z} \,\} = \{\, |x + n| : n \in \mathbb{Z} \,\} = D(x)$, using $|-u| = |u|$ and the bijection $n \mapsto -n$ of $\mathbb{Z}$ — determine it everywhere.
