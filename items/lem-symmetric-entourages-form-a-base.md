## Statement

If $\mathcal U$ is a uniformity on $X$, then its symmetric entourages form a filter base: for every $E\in\mathcal U$ there is a symmetric $D\in\mathcal U$ with $D\subseteq E$. More generally, for every entourage $E$ and every integer $n\ge 1$, there is a symmetric entourage $D$ whose $n$-fold composite satisfies $D^{\circ n}\subseteq E$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A uniformity $\mathcal U$ on $X$, an entourage $E\in\mathcal U$, and an integer $n\ge 1$.

[A1] A uniformity is a filter whose members are closed under inverse and admit square roots ([[def-uniform-space-by-entourages]]).

[L1] A nonempty, proper family that refines every pair of its members is a filter base ([[def-filter-base]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Choose $R\in\mathcal U$ with $R\circ R\subseteq E$, and put $S:=R\cap R^{-1}$. [A1, choose]

1.2 Put $E_0:=E$. By finitely iterating the square-root axiom, choose entourages $E_1,\ldots,E_n$ such that $E_{k+1}\circ E_{k+1}\subseteq E_k$ for $0\le k<n$, and put $D:=E_n\cap E_n^{-1}$. [A1, choose]

2.1 The set $S$ is an entourage, since $R,R^{-1}\in\mathcal U$ and a filter is closed under intersections; also $S=S^{-1}$ and $S\subseteq R\circ R\subseteq E$, because every entourage contains the diagonal. [step 1.1, A1]

2.2 The entourage $D$ is symmetric and $D\subseteq E_n$. Induction on $k$ gives $D^{\circ 2^k}\subseteq E_{n-k}$ for $0\le k\le n$, hence $D^{\circ 2^n}\subseteq E$. Since every entourage contains the diagonal and $n\le 2^n$, one may insert diagonal factors to obtain $D^{\circ n}\subseteq D^{\circ 2^n}\subseteq E$. [step 1.2, A1, algebra]

3.1 Thus symmetric entourages refine every entourage; their intersections are symmetric entourages and none is empty because each contains the diagonal, so they form a filter base by [L1]. [step 2.1, L1]

4.1 Therefore symmetric entourages form a base and admit the asserted finite-composite control. [step 3.1, step 2.2] ∎
