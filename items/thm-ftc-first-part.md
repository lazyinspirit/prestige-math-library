## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]), let $F$ be its integral function
([[def-the-integral-function]]), and let $c \in [a,b]$ be a point at which $f$ is
continuous ([[def-continuity-real]]). Then $F$ is differentiable at $c$ as a
function on $[a,b]$ ([[def-derivative]]) and

$$F'(c) \;=\; f(c) .$$

At $c = a$ and $c = b$ this is the one-sided statement, which is what
[[def-derivative]] means at those points: every point of a nondegenerate interval
is a limit point of it, so $F'(c)$ is a meaningful symbol at every $c \in [a,b]$,
and the difference quotient is taken over $[a,b] \setminus \{c\}$.

**Consequently, if $f$ is continuous on the whole of $[a,b]$, then $F$ is a
primitive of $f$ there**: $F' = f$ at every point of $[a,b]$.

**Continuity at $c$ is a hypothesis and it cannot be dropped.** For an integrable
$f$ that is discontinuous at $c$, $F'(c)$ may fail to exist, and it may exist and
differ from $f(c)$; both are exhibited on the companion page, by
an integrable function with no primitive and by a false
statement about the integral function.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, an integrable $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, its integral function $F(x) = \int_a^x f$, a point $c \in [a,b]$ at which $f$ is continuous, and a real $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] $F(x) - F(c) = \int_c^x f$ for all $x, c \in [a,b]$, in either order ([[def-the-integral-function]], [[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]]).

[L2] Continuity at $c$: for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $t \in [a,b]$ with $|t - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|f(t) - f(c)| < \eta$ ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L3] Every point of a nondegenerate interval is a limit point of it, so $F'(c) = \lim_{x\to c} \bigl(F(x)-F(c)\bigr)/(x-c)$ is a meaningful symbol, the limit being taken over $[a,b]\setminus\{c\}$ ([[def-derivative]], [[def-function-limit]], [[def-interval]]).

[L4] For $p < q$ in $[a,b]$: $f$ and $|f|$ and every constant are integrable on $[p,q]$; $\int_p^q \lambda = \lambda(q-p)$; sums and scalar multiples of integrable functions are integrable with the corresponding identity; and $\bigl|\int_p^q u\bigr| \le \int_p^q |u|$ ([[lem-integrability-on-a-subinterval]], [[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]], [[thm-linearity-of-the-integral]], [[cor-integrability-of-absolute-values-products-and-lattice-operations]]).

[L5] If $u \le w$ pointwise on $[p,q]$ and both are integrable then $\int_p^q u \le \int_p^q w$ ([[thm-monotonicity-of-the-integral]]).

[L6] With oriented limits, $\int_q^p u = -\int_p^q u$ and $\int_p^p u = 0$ ([[def-oriented-integral]]).

[L7] Absolute value and ordered-field arithmetic: $|{-t}| = |t|$, $|t\,s| = |t||s|$, $|t| \le c$ follows from $-c \le t \le c$, a positive real has a positive inverse, and the order is total and transitive ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). The nonstrict forms of the order facts follow from the strict ones by adjoining equality.

[L8] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a real $\eta' > 0$ with $\eta' < \eta$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L2] with $\eta := \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$, fix a real $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(t)-f(c)| < \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1}$ for every $t \in [a,b]$ with $|t-c| < \delta$. [given, L2, L7, L8, choose]

1.2 For $x \in [a,b]$ with $x \ne c$, [L1] and [L4] give $F(x) - F(c) - f(c)(x-c) = \int_c^x f - \int_c^x f(c) = \int_c^x \bigl(f(t) - f(c)\bigr)\,\mathrm{d}t$, the constant $f(c)$ having integral $f(c)(x-c)$ over the oriented interval from $c$ to $x$ by [L4] and [L6]. [L1, L4, L6]

2.1 **The estimate for $c < x < c+\delta$.** Every $t \in [c,x]$ has $|t-c| < \delta$, so $-\varepsilon\cdot2^{-1} \le f(t)-f(c) \le \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1}$ there by step 1.1, whence $\bigl|\int_c^x (f - f(c))\bigr| \le \varepsilon\cdot2^{-1}\,(x-c)$ by [L4] and [L5]. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L4, L5, L7]

2.2 **The estimate for $c-\delta < x < c$.** By [L6], $\int_c^x (f-f(c)) = -\int_x^c (f-f(c))$, and every $t \in [x,c]$ has $|t-c| < \delta$, so the same argument gives $\bigl|\int_c^x (f-f(c))\bigr| \le \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1}\,(c-x)$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L4, L5, L6, L7]

3.1 In both cases $\bigl|\int_c^x(f-f(c))\bigr| \le \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1}\,|x-c|$, so dividing by the nonzero $|x-c|$ and using step 1.2 gives $\Bigl|\dfrac{F(x)-F(c)}{x-c} - f(c)\Bigr| \le \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1} < \varepsilon$ for every $x \in [a,b]$ with $0 < |x-c| < \delta$. [step 1.2, step 2.1, step 2.2, L7]

4.1 Since $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary, the limit of the difference quotient of $F$ at $c$ exists and equals $f(c)$ by [L3]; that is, $F'(c) = f(c)$. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L3]

5.1 If $f$ is continuous at every point of $[a,b]$ then step 4.1 applies at every $c \in [a,b]$, so $F' = f$ on $[a,b]$ and $F$ is a primitive of $f$. [step 4.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **The estimate is written out for $x < c$ as well, and that is not redundancy.** For $x < c$ the factor $1/(x-c)$ is negative and the naive chain $m(x-c) \le \int_c^x \le M(x-c)$ reverses; what makes the argument uniform is taking absolute values *before* dividing, which is what steps 2.1, 2.2 and 3.1 do. This is the single most common error in this proof.

- **The route is the definition of the derivative, not the mean value theorem for integrals.** Deducing $F'(c) = f(c)$ from [[thm-first-mean-value-theorem-for-integrals]] would need $f$ continuous on a whole subinterval around $c$, which is a strictly stronger hypothesis than continuity at the single point $c$. The theorem as stated is the sharp one.

- **What is proved at a point is proved at a point.** Nothing here says $F$ is differentiable anywhere else, and nothing says $F' = f$ off the continuity set of $f$. Where $f$ is merely integrable, all that survives is [[thm-the-integral-function-is-lipschitz]].

- **Forward references, orientation only.** The two failures at a discontinuity are worked out on the companion page as [[cex-an-integrable-function-with-no-primitive]] and [[fs-the-integral-function-is-always-a-primitive]]; nothing above depends on either.
