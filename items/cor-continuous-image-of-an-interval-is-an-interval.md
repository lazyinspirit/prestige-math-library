## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $A$
([[def-continuity-real]]) and let $I \subseteq A$ be order-convex
([[def-interval]]). Then:

1. $f[I]$ is order-convex, hence connected
   ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]], [[def-connected-r]]);
2. if $I = [a,b]$ with $a \le b$, then $f[I] = [m, M]$ where
   $m = \min f[I]$ and $M = \max f[I]$ ([[def-max-min]]) — a **closed bounded
   interval**, degenerate exactly when $f$ is constant on $[a,b]$.

**"Interval" means "order-convex" here.** As [[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]]
records, this library proves that the connected subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ are
exactly the order-convex ones, and does **not** prove that every order-convex
subset is one of the nine written forms of [[def-interval]]. Claim 1 is
therefore stated as order-convexity, which is what the intermediate value
theorem delivers; claim 2 identifies the written form in the one case where the
extreme value theorem supplies the endpoints.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ continuous on $A$, and an order-convex set $I \subseteq A$.

[L1] Intermediate value theorem: if $u \le v$ in $\mathbb{R}$, if $f$ is continuous on $[u,v]$ and if $w$ lies between $f(u)$ and $f(v)$ in either order, then $f(t) = w$ for some $t \in [u,v]$ ([[thm-intermediate-value]]).

[L2] Continuity passes to subsets of the domain: if $B \subseteq A$ then $f|_B$ is continuous on $B$, since the defining condition quantifies over fewer points ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L3] Order-convexity: $x, z \in S$ and $x \le w \le z$ imply $w \in S$; every closed bounded interval $[u,v]$ with $u \le v$ is order-convex and is a subset of any order-convex set containing $u$ and $v$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L4] Connectedness: a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is connected if and only if it is order-convex ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]], [[def-connected-r]]).

[L5] $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$ is nonempty, closed and bounded ([[def-interval]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-bounded-set]]), hence compact ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L6] Extreme value theorem: a continuous real function on a nonempty compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ attains a greatest and a least value on it ([[thm-extreme-value-r]], [[def-max-min]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Claim 1.** Let $u', v' \in f[I]$ and let $w$ satisfy $u' \le w \le v'$. Write $u' = f(p)$ and $v' = f(q)$ with $p, q \in I$, and let $[s,t]$ be the closed bounded interval with $\{s,t\} = \{p,q\}$ and $s \le t$; by [L3] and order-convexity of $I$ we have $[s,t] \subseteq I \subseteq A$. [L3, choose]

1.2 **Claim 2, the endpoints.** Suppose $I = [a,b]$ with $a \le b$. By [L5] the set $[a,b]$ is nonempty and compact, so by [L6] there are $q, p \in [a,b]$ with $f(q) \le f(x) \le f(p)$ for every $x \in [a,b]$; put $m := f(q)$ and $M := f(p)$, so $m = \min f[I]$ and $M = \max f[I]$ and $m \le M$. [L5, L6, choose]

2.1 By [L2] the restriction of $f$ to $[s,t]$ is continuous on $[s,t]$, and $w$ lies between $f(s)$ and $f(t)$ in one order or the other, since $\{f(s), f(t)\} = \{u', v'\}$ and $u' \le w \le v'$. By [L1] there is $c \in [s,t] \subseteq I$ with $f(c) = w$, so $w \in f[I]$. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

3.1 So $f[I]$ is order-convex, and by [L4] it is connected. This is claim 1. [step 2.1, L4]

4.1 **Claim 2, the two inclusions.** Every $z \in f[I]$ satisfies $m \le z \le M$ by step 1.2, so $f[I] \subseteq [m,M]$. Conversely, $m$ and $M$ lie in $f[I]$ and $f[I]$ is order-convex by step 3.1, so every $w$ with $m \le w \le M$ lies in $f[I]$; hence $[m,M] \subseteq f[I]$. Therefore $f[I] = [m,M]$, a closed bounded interval, and it is the single point $\{m\}$ exactly when $m = M$, that is exactly when $f$ is constant on $[a,b]$. [step 3.1, step 1.2, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **The two halves come from the two theorems.** Order-convexity of the image is the intermediate value theorem and needs nothing else; that the image of a *closed bounded* interval is again closed and bounded is the extreme value theorem, and it fails for other interval forms: the continuous image of $(0,1)$ under $x \mapsto 1/x$ is $(1,\infty)$, and under $x \mapsto x$ it is $(0,1)$, neither closed.

- **The converse of claim 1 is false.** A function whose image on every subinterval is order-convex need not be continuous; this is the intermediate value property without continuity, and the witness for it is not available at this point in the reading order. What *is* true, and is proved on this page, is that a function which is monotone and has an order-convex image is continuous ([[lem-monotone-with-interval-image-is-continuous]]).

- **Claim 2 is the shape the $n$-th-root example uses.** Applying it to $x \mapsto x^{n}$ on $[0, a+1]$ gives an interval containing $0$ and $(a+1)^{n} \ge a$, hence containing $a$; that is the second proof of the existence of $n$-th roots recorded in [[ex-ivt-gives-nth-roots]] on the companion page.
