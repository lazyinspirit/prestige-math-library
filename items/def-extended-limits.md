## Definition

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]) and let
$L \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-extended-reals]]). Say that $(x_k)$
**converges to $L$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$** when one of the following holds,
according to which of the three kinds of element $L$ is:

- $L \in \mathbb{R}$ and $(x_k)$ converges to $L$ in the sense of [[def-real-limit]];
- $L = +\infty$ and $x_k \to +\infty$ in the sense of [[def-divergence-to-infinity]];
- $L = -\infty$ and $x_k \to -\infty$ in the sense of [[def-divergence-to-infinity]].

Then $L$ is an **extended subsequential limit** of $(x_k)$ when some subsequence
of $(x_k)$ converges to $L$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$: when there is a strictly
increasing $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-sequence]]) such that
$(x_{n_j})_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges to $L$ in the sense just given. The
**extended subsequential limit set** of $(x_k)$ is

$$\overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x) \;:=\; \{\, L \in \overline{\mathbb{R}} : L \text{ is an extended subsequential limit of } (x_k) \,\} \subseteq \overline{\mathbb{R}}.$$

**This extends the published [[def-subsequential-limit]] and does not replace
it.** That definition is finite by design: there $L$ ranges over $\mathbb{R}$ and
$\operatorname{SL}(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Its clause is quoted verbatim as the
first of the three clauses above, so

$$\overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x) \cap \mathbb{R} = \operatorname{SL}(x),$$

immediately from the definitions: a real $L$ lies in
$\overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$ exactly when some subsequence converges to $L$
in the sense of [[def-real-limit]], which is exactly the condition
$L \in \operatorname{SL}(x)$. The extended set is therefore
$\operatorname{SL}(x)$ together with at most the two extra points $\pm\infty$,
each present exactly when some subsequence diverges to it. Nothing about
$\operatorname{SL}(x)$ is redefined, and every statement proved about
$\operatorname{SL}(x)$ elsewhere in the library remains a statement about the
same set.

**Neither is [[def-divergence-to-infinity]] reinterpreted.** The phrase
"$x_k \to +\infty$" keeps exactly the meaning fixed there, an abbreviation for
"for every real $M$, eventually $x_k > M$". What is new is only that the phrase
is now allowed to appear as one of three clauses in a single definition whose
parameter $L$ ranges over $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, so that the three situations
can be quantified over together. In particular the warning recorded there stands:
a sequence diverging to $+\infty$ has no limit in $\mathbb{R}$, and none of the
rules of [[thm-algebra-of-limits]] applies to it.

## Remarks

- **An extended limit is unique.** Suppose $(x_k)$ converges to $L$ and to $L'$ in
  $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$. If both are real, $L = L'$ by uniqueness of real limits
  ([[lem-limit-unique]]). If one is real and the other is $\pm\infty$, that is
  impossible, because a sequence diverging to $\pm\infty$ is unbounded and so does
  not converge, as [[def-divergence-to-infinity]] records. If $L = +\infty$ and
  $L' = -\infty$ then, taking $M = 0$ in both conditions, there are $K$ and $K'$
  with $x_k > 0$ for $k \ge K$ and $x_k < 0$ for $k \ge K'$; any index at least as
  large as both gives $0 < x_k < 0$, which is impossible. So the three clauses are
  mutually exclusive and each determines $L$.

- **Why the extended set is the right object for a $\limsup$ theorem.** The
  greatest subsequential limit of an arbitrary real sequence need not be a real
  number: the sequence that alternates between $0$ and larger and larger values
  has $\operatorname{SL}(x) = \{0\}$, whose greatest element is $0$, while the
  behaviour that dominates it is a subsequence running off to $+\infty$. That is
  exactly the content of [[cex-limsup-infinite-not-attained-in-r]], and it is why
  [[thm-limsup-is-greatest-subsequential-limit]] is stated for
  $\overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$ rather than for $\operatorname{SL}(x)$.

- **A tail changes nothing.** A strictly increasing index map satisfies
  $n_j \ge j$ ([[lem-index-map-grows]]), so all three clauses depend only on the
  behaviour of $(x_k)$ at arbitrarily large indices, and a sequence and each of
  its tails have the same extended subsequential limit set. This is the same
  observation made for $\operatorname{SL}(x)$ in [[def-subsequential-limit]], with
  the two divergence clauses added.
