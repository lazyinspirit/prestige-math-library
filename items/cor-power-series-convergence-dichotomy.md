## Statement

Let $\sum a_n(x-c)^n$ have radius $R$. It converges absolutely at every $x$ with $|x-c|<R$ and diverges at every $x$ with $|x-c|>R$. When $0<R<+\infty$, no common conclusion holds at either endpoint $c\pm R$: power series of radius $R$ can converge there, even absolutely, or diverge there.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real power series $\sum a_n(x-c)^n$ with radius $R$ ([[def-real-power-series-and-radius-of-convergence]]).

[L1] Cauchy-Hadamard identifies $R$ from the limit superior of the coefficient roots and the root test gives absolute convergence below the reciprocal threshold and divergence above it ([[thm-cauchy-hadamard-for-real-power-series]]).

[L2] At root-test boundary value $1$, the coefficient families $1/(n+1)$ and $1/(n+1)^2$ both have root limit superior $1$, while the first series diverges and the second converges; changing the coefficient signs does not change their absolute values ([[thm-root-test]], claim 3).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The assertions for $|x-c|<R$ and $|x-c|>R$ are exactly the two strict alternatives supplied by [L1], including the cases $R=0$ and $R=+\infty$. [L1]

1.2 For endpoint behaviour at radius $1$, the series with coefficients $1/(n+1)^2$ converges absolutely at both $x=1$ and $x=-1$. The series with coefficients $1/(n+1)$ diverges at $x=1$, while the series with coefficients $(-1)^n/(n+1)$ diverges at $x=-1$. All three have radius $1$ by [L2]. [L2]

2.1 Replacing $x$ by $(x-c)/R$ and multiplying coefficients by the corresponding powers of $R^{-1}$ transports the two radius-one examples to any finite $R>0$ and centre $c$. Thus either behaviour may occur at an endpoint, while no assertion has been made when the endpoints are not real. [step 1.2, algebra] ∎
