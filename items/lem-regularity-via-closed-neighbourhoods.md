## Statement

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]), with
closures as in [[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]] and neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-top]], so that a neighbourhood need not be open. The
following three conditions are equivalent.

- **(a)** $X$ is regular ([[def-regular-and-t3-spaces]]).
- **(b)** For every $x \in X$ and every open $U$ with $x \in U$ there is an open
  $V$ with
  $$x \in V \subseteq \overline{V} \subseteq U .$$
- **(c)** Every point of $X$ has a neighbourhood base consisting of **closed**
  neighbourhoods: for every $x \in X$ and every neighbourhood $N$ of $x$ there is
  a closed neighbourhood $K$ of $x$ with $K \subseteq N$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A topological space $(X,\mathcal{T})$, a point $x \in X$, an open set $U$ with $x \in U$, a neighbourhood $N$ of $x$, and a closed set $C$ with $x \notin C$.

[A1] $X$ is regular when for every closed $C$ and every $x \notin C$ there are disjoint open $U_0 \ni x$ and $V_0 \supseteq C$ ([[def-regular-and-t3-spaces]]).

[L1] $N$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ exactly when some open $W$ satisfies $x \in W \subseteq N$; a set is open exactly when it is a neighbourhood of each of its points ([[def-neighbourhood-top]]).

[L2] $\overline{V}$ is the smallest closed superset of $V$: it is closed, contains $V$, and is contained in every closed set containing $V$ ([[thm-closure-characterisation-top]], claim 2, [[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

[L3] $\operatorname{int}(K)$ is the largest open subset of $K$, and $x \in \operatorname{int}(K)$ exactly when $K$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

[L4] A set is closed exactly when its complement is open ([[def-topological-space]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume (a) and let $U$ be open with $x \in U$; then $C := X \setminus U$ is closed by [L4] and $x \notin C$, so [A1] gives disjoint open $V \ni x$ and $W \supseteq C$. [A1, L4, assume-hyp]

1.2 Assume (b) and let $N$ be a neighbourhood of $x$; fix an open $U$ with $x \in U \subseteq N$ by [L1], and let $V$ be as in (b), so $x \in V \subseteq \overline{V} \subseteq U \subseteq N$. [L1, assume-hyp]

1.3 Assume (c) and let $C$ be closed with $x \notin C$; then $X \setminus C$ is open by [L4] and contains $x$, hence is a neighbourhood of $x$ by [L1], so (c) gives a closed neighbourhood $K$ of $x$ with $K \subseteq X \setminus C$. [L1, L4, assume-hyp]

2.1 Under step 1.1: $V \subseteq X \setminus W$, since $V$ and $W$ are disjoint, and $X \setminus W$ is closed by [L4], so $\overline{V} \subseteq X \setminus W$ by [L2]; and $X \setminus W \subseteq X \setminus C = U$ because $C \subseteq W$. [step 1.1, L2, L4]

2.2 Under step 1.2: $\overline{V}$ is a closed set containing the open $V \ni x$, so it is a neighbourhood of $x$ by [L1], and it is a closed neighbourhood of $x$ contained in $N$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.3 Under step 1.3: put $V_0 := \operatorname{int}(K)$, which is open and contains $x$ by [L3] since $K$ is a neighbourhood of $x$; and put $W_0 := X \setminus K$, which is open by [L4] since $K$ is closed. [step 1.3, L3, L4]

3.1 Step 2.1 gives $x \in V \subseteq \overline{V} \subseteq U$ with $V$ open, so (a) implies (b). [step 2.1]

3.2 Step 2.2 gives, for every neighbourhood $N$ of $x$, a closed neighbourhood of $x$ inside $N$, so (b) implies (c). [step 2.2]

3.3 Under step 2.3: $V_0 \cap W_0 = \operatorname{int}(K) \cap (X \setminus K) = \varnothing$ because $\operatorname{int}(K) \subseteq K$ by [L3], and $C \subseteq X \setminus K = W_0$ because $K \subseteq X \setminus C$; so $V_0$ and $W_0$ are disjoint open sets containing $x$ and $C$ respectively, and (c) implies (a). [step 2.3, A1, L3]

4.1 By steps 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 the three conditions (a), (b) and (c) are equivalent. [step 3.1, step 3.2, step 3.3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Clause (b) is the working form.** Every application of regularity below uses it in the shape "shrink an open set around a point so that even its closure stays inside", which is what makes regularity behave like a one-sided version of the normality shrinking lemma proved later on this page.

- **Clause (c) is what makes a clopen basis decisive.** If a space has a basis of clopen sets then the basic sets containing a point are closed neighbourhoods of it and form a neighbourhood base ([[def-neighbourhood-top]]), so (c) holds and the space is regular with no further work. That is exactly the route by which the ordinal spaces later on this page are shown to be regular.

- **No separation hypothesis is used anywhere above.** Points need not be closed, and the lemma is a statement about regularity alone; combining it with $T_1$ is the separate step that produces $T_3$.
