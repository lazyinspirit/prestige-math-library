## Statement

Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals whose series converges conditionally
([[def-absolute-and-conditional-convergence]]). Let $\alpha, \beta \in
\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-extended-reals]]) with $\alpha \le \beta$. Then
there is a bijection $\sigma : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]) such that the partial sums
$T_n = \sum_{k<n} a_{\sigma(k)}$ of the rearranged series
([[def-rearrangement-and-unconditional-convergence]]) satisfy

$$\liminf_{n} T_n = \alpha, \qquad \limsup_{n} T_n = \beta$$

([[def-limsup-liminf]]). In particular:

1. for every $c \in \mathbb{R}$, taking $\alpha = \beta = c$, there is a
   rearrangement of $\sum a_k$ that converges with sum $c$;
2. taking $\alpha = \beta = +\infty$, there is a rearrangement whose partial sums
   diverge to $+\infty$ ([[def-divergence-to-infinity]]), and taking
   $\alpha = \beta = -\infty$, one whose partial sums diverge to $-\infty$;
3. taking $\alpha < \beta$, there is a rearrangement whose partial sums oscillate,
   with limit inferior exactly $\alpha$ and limit superior exactly $\beta$.

So the sum of a conditionally convergent series is an artefact of the order in
which its terms are written, and every prescribed asymptotic behaviour is
attainable. Contrast [[thm-dirichlet-rearrangement]], where absolute convergence
makes the sum independent of the order.

**The construction.** Write $P := \{k : a_k \ge 0\}$ and $N := \{k : a_k < 0\}$,
which partition $\mathbb{N}$, and enumerate each increasingly as $(p_i)$ and
$(q_l)$. Fix real sequences $(u_j)$ and $(v_j)$ with $u_j \le v_j$ and
$u_j \le v_{j+1}$ for every $j$; these are the *targets*. The rearrangement is
produced one index at a time by a greedy rule: **while the running sum is at most
the current upper target, take the next unused nonnegative term; once it exceeds
that target, take negative terms until the running sum falls below the current
lower target; then move to the next pair of targets and repeat.** Both supplies
are inexhaustible, because for a conditionally convergent series both
$\sum a_k^{+}$ and $\sum a_k^{-}$ diverge to $+\infty$
([[lem-positive-and-negative-parts]]); and the overshoot at each turning point is
at most the term just used, which tends to $0$ because $a_k \to 0$
([[lem-nth-term-test]]). Those two facts are the whole theorem.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(a_k)$ of reals with $\sum a_k$ convergent and $\sum |a_k|$ divergent; the positive and negative parts $a_k^{+}$, $a_k^{-}$; the sets $P = \{k : a_k \ge 0\}$ and $N = \{k : a_k < 0\}$; and extended reals $\alpha \le \beta$.

[A1] $P$ and $N$ are disjoint with union $\mathbb{N}$, since the order on $\mathbb{R}$ is total; $a_k^{+} = a_k$ and $a_k^{-} = 0$ for $k \in P$, while $a_k^{+} = 0$ and $a_k^{-} = -a_k$ for $k \in N$ ([[lem-positive-and-negative-parts]]).

[L1] For a conditionally convergent series, the partial sums of $\sum a_k^{+}$ and of $\sum a_k^{-}$ both diverge to $+\infty$ ([[lem-positive-and-negative-parts]], [[def-divergence-to-infinity]]).

[L2] The terms of a convergent series tend to $0$ ([[lem-nth-term-test]]).

[L3] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L4] The recursion theorem: for a set $A$, an element $a \in A$ and a function $f : A \to A$ there is a unique $g : \mathbb{N} \to A$ with $g(0) = a$ and $g(n+1) = f(g(n))$ ([[thm-recursion]]).

[L5] The principle of induction on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L6] Finite sums: $\sum_{k<0} x_k = 0$, $\sum_{k<n+1}x_k = \sum_{k<n}x_k + x_n$, splitting at an intermediate index, and $\sum_{k<n} 0 = 0$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L7] Partial sums of a series and their recursion $s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ ([[def-series]]).

[L8] Limits preserve non-strict inequalities holding eventually ([[lem-limit-preserves-order]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L9] A bijection is an injective surjection ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L10] $\limsup_n x_n = \inf\{\, \sup\{x_m : m \ge n\} : n \in \mathbb{N} \,\}$ and $\liminf_n x_n = \sup\{\, \inf\{x_m : m \ge n\} : n \in \mathbb{N}\,\}$, both taken in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-limsup-liminf]], [[def-extended-reals]]).

[L11] A sequence converges to a real $L$ exactly when its limit inferior and limit superior both equal $L$, and diverges to $\pm\infty$ exactly when both equal $\pm\infty$ ([[thm-convergence-iff-limsup-equals-liminf]], [[def-extended-limits]]).

[L12] For nonnegative terms, a series diverges exactly when the range of its partial sums is unbounded above, and then those partial sums diverge to $+\infty$ ([[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 Since $\sum a_k$ converges, $a_k \to 0$. [given, L2]

1.2 For every $K \in \mathbb{N}$ there is $k \ge K$ with $k \in P$: otherwise $a_k < 0$ for every $k \ge K$, so $a_k^{+} = 0$ for every $k \ge K$, so the partial sums of $\sum a_k^{+}$ are constant from $K$ on and hence bounded, contradicting [L1]. The same argument with $a_k^{-}$ shows that for every $K$ there is $k \ge K$ with $k \in N$. [A1, L1, L6, L12]

2.1 In particular $P$ and $N$ are nonempty, and for every $k$ the sets $\{m \in P : m > k\}$ and $\{m \in N : m > k\}$ are nonempty; so by [L3] each has a least element. [step 1.2, L3]

3.1 Define $p : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ by $p_0 := \min P$ and $p_{i+1} := \min\{m \in P : m > p_i\}$, and $q : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ by $q_0 := \min N$ and $q_{l+1} := \min\{m \in N : m > q_l\}$; both are legitimate applications of the recursion theorem, the "next element" operations being total functions $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ by step 2.1. Both $p$ and $q$ take values in $P$, respectively $N$, and are strictly increasing. [step 2.1, L3, L4, construct]

4.1 An induction gives $p_i \ge i$ and $q_l \ge l$ for every index, since $p_0 \ge 0$ and $p_{i+1} > p_i \ge i$ forces $p_{i+1} \ge i+1$. [step 3.1, L5]

4.2 An induction on $i$ gives $P \cap \{k : k < p_i\} = \{p_{i'} : i' < i\}$: at $i = 0$ both sides are empty because $p_0$ is the least element of $P$; and passing from $i$ to $i+1$ adds exactly $p_i$, since $p_{i+1}$ is the least element of $P$ strictly greater than $p_i$, so no element of $P$ lies strictly between them. The same holds for $q$ and $N$. [step 3.1, L5]

4.3 Fix real sequences $(u_j)$ and $(v_j)$ with $u_j \le v_j$ and $u_j \le v_{j+1}$ for every $j$. Put $A := \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R} \times \{0,1\}$, whose elements are written $(i, l, j, s, m)$, and define $\mathrm{out} : A \to \mathbb{N}$ and $f : A \to A$ by: if $m = 0$ and $s \le v_j$, then $\mathrm{out} := p_i$ and $f := (i+1, l, j, s + a_{p_i}, 0)$; if $m = 0$ and $s > v_j$, then $\mathrm{out} := q_l$ and $f := (i, l+1, j, s + a_{q_l}, 1)$; if $m = 1$ and $s \ge u_j$, then $\mathrm{out} := q_l$ and $f := (i, l+1, j, s + a_{q_l}, 1)$; if $m = 1$ and $s < u_j$, then $\mathrm{out} := p_i$ and $f := (i+1, l, j+1, s + a_{p_i}, 0)$. The four cases are exhaustive and mutually exclusive, the order on $\mathbb{R}$ being total, so $f$ and $\mathrm{out}$ are functions. [step 3.1, construct]

5.1 Every element of $P$ is some $p_i$, and every element of $N$ is some $q_l$: given $k \in P$, the set $\{i : p_i > k\}$ is nonempty by step 4.1, so it has a least element $i_0$; $i_0 \ne 0$ since $p_0 = \min P \le k$, and $p_{i_0 - 1} \le k < p_{i_0}$, so $k \in P \cap \{m : m < p_{i_0}\} = \{p_{i'} : i' < i_0\}$ by step 4.2. Together with step 3.1 this says that $p$ is a bijection onto $P$ and $q$ a bijection onto $N$; both are injective because they are strictly increasing. [step 3.1, step 4.1, step 4.2, L3, L9]

5.2 An induction on $i$ gives $\sum_{i' < i} a_{p_{i'}} = \sum_{k < p_i} a_k^{+}$: at $i = 0$ every $k < p_0$ lies in $N$, so $a_k^{+} = 0$ and both sides are $0$; and splitting $\sum_{k<p_{i+1}} a_k^{+}$ at $p_i$ and at $p_i + 1$ isolates the single term $a_{p_i}^{+} = a_{p_i}$, all remaining indices $k$ with $p_i < k < p_{i+1}$ lying in $N$ by step 4.2 and contributing $0$. The same argument gives $\sum_{l' < l} a_{q_{l'}} = -\sum_{k<q_l} a_k^{-}$. [A1, step 3.1, step 4.2, L5, L6]

5.3 By the recursion theorem let $g : \mathbb{N} \to A$ satisfy $g(0) = (0,0,0,0,0)$ and $g(n+1) = f(g(n))$, write $g(n) = (i_n, l_n, j_n, s_n, m_n)$, and define $\sigma(n) := \mathrm{out}(g(n))$. [step 4.3, L4, construct]

5.4 For general $\alpha \le \beta$ choose real sequences with $u_j \le v_j$ and $u_j \le v_{j+1}$ as follows: if $\alpha, \beta$ are real, $u_j := \alpha$ and $v_j := \beta$; if $\alpha = -\infty$ and $\beta$ is real, $u_j := \beta - (j+1)$ and $v_j := \beta$; if $\alpha$ is real and $\beta = +\infty$, $u_j := \alpha$ and $v_j := \alpha + (j+1)$; if $\alpha = \beta = +\infty$, $u_j := j$ and $v_j := j+1$; if $\alpha = \beta = -\infty$, $u_j := -(j+2)$ and $v_j := -(j+1)$; and if $\alpha = -\infty$, $\beta = +\infty$, $u_j := -(j+1)$ and $v_j := j+1$. In every case $(u_j)$ tends to $\alpha$ and $(v_j)$ to $\beta$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, and both conditions of step 4.3 hold. [step 4.3, L11, choose]

6.1 Hence $\sum_{i'<i} a_{p_{i'}} \to +\infty$ as $i \to \infty$ and $\sum_{l'<l} a_{q_{l'}} \to -\infty$ as $l \to \infty$: the left-hand sides are the values of the partial sums of $\sum a_k^{+}$, respectively of $-\sum a_k^{-}$, at the strictly increasing indices $p_i$, respectively $q_l$, and by step 4.1 those indices are at least $i$, respectively $l$. [step 4.1, step 5.2, L1]

6.2 An induction on $n$ gives $i_n + l_n = n$ and $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_{\sigma(k)}$: both hold at $n = 0$, and each transition increases exactly one of $i, l$ by one and adds to $s$ exactly the term $a_{\sigma(n)}$ indexed by the emitted natural. So $s_n = T_n$, the $n$-th partial sum of the rearranged series. [step 4.3, step 5.3, L5, L7]

7.1 Consequently, for every $i_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ and every real $M$ there is $i > i_0$ with $\sum_{i'=i_0}^{i-1} a_{p_{i'}} > M$, and for every $l_0$ and every real $M$ there is $l > l_0$ with $\sum_{l' = l_0}^{l-1} a_{q_{l'}} < M$; this is step 6.1 together with splitting of finite sums, the omitted initial block being a fixed real. [step 6.1, L6]

7.2 An induction on $n$ gives that $\sigma(n) = p_{i_n}$ at every step that increments $i$, and $\sigma(n) = q_{l_n}$ at every step that increments $l$; since $(i_n)$ and $(l_n)$ are nondecreasing and increase by one exactly at those steps, distinct steps of the first kind carry distinct values of $i_n$ and distinct steps of the second kind distinct values of $l_n$. As $p$ and $q$ are injective with disjoint ranges $P$ and $N$, the map $\sigma$ is injective. [step 4.3, step 6.2, step 5.1, L5]

8.1 There are infinitely many steps of each kind: if from some step $n_0$ on no step increments $l$, then $m_n$ is eventually constantly $0$, because a step with $m = 1$ that does not increment $l$ sets $m$ to $0$ and a step with $m = 0$ that does not increment $l$ leaves $m$ at $0$; then $j_n$ is eventually constant, say $j$, and every subsequent step satisfies $s_n \le v_{j}$, while by step 7.1 the values $s_n$, which from $n_0$ on increase by the successive terms $a_{p_i}$, exceed $v_j$ for some $n$. Symmetrically, if from some step on no step increments $i$, then $m_n$ is eventually constantly $1$, $j_n$ is eventually constant $j$, every subsequent step satisfies $s_n \ge u_j$, and step 7.1 makes $s_n$ fall below $u_j$. [step 7.1, step 4.3, step 6.2, L5]

9.1 Hence $i_n \to \infty$ and $l_n \to \infty$, so every $p_i$ and every $q_l$ occurs as some $\sigma(n)$; since $P \cup N = \mathbb{N}$ and $p, q$ enumerate $P$ and $N$, the map $\sigma$ is surjective, and with step 7.2 it is a bijection of $\mathbb{N}$. [A1, step 5.1, step 7.2, step 8.1, L9]

9.2 Likewise $j_n \to \infty$: if $j_n$ were eventually constant $j$, then from some step on no round is completed, so no step has $m = 1$ and $s < u_j$; by the argument of step 8.1 the mode is then eventually constant, and either it is $0$ forever, whence $s_n \le v_j$ always while $s_n$ increases past $v_j$, or it is $1$ forever, whence $s_n \ge u_j$ always while $s_n$ falls below $u_j$. [step 7.1, step 4.3, step 8.1]

10.1 For each $j \ge 1$ let $\beta_j$ be the step at which the mode of round $j$ changes from $0$ to $1$, that is the unique $n$ with $j_n = j$, $m_n = 0$ and $s_n > v_j$, and let $\alpha_j$ be the step at which round $j$ is completed, the unique $n$ with $j_n = j$, $m_n = 1$ and $s_n < u_j$; both exist by step 8.1 and step 9.2, and $\alpha_{j-1} < \beta_j < \alpha_j$. [step 4.3, step 8.1, step 9.2, choose]

11.1 The step $\beta_j$ is preceded, within round $j$, either by a step that added a term $a_{p_i} \ge 0$ to a value $s \le v_j$, or by the completing step $\alpha_{j-1}$ of the previous round, which added a term $a_{p_i} \ge 0$ to a value $s < u_{j-1} \le v_j$. In both situations $v_j < T_{\beta_j} \le v_j + a_{p_i}$ for the index $i$ used at the immediately preceding step. [step 4.3, step 10.1]

11.2 Likewise the step $\alpha_j$ is preceded within round $j$ by a step that added a term $a_{q_l} < 0$ to a value $s \ge u_j$, that step being either an earlier descent step or the switch $\beta_j$ itself, at which $s > v_j \ge u_j$; so $u_j - |a_{q_l}| \le T_{\alpha_j} < u_j$ for the index $l$ used at that step. [step 4.3, step 10.1]

11.3 For $\alpha_{j-1} \le n \le \beta_j$ the partial sums increase, every step of the climb adding a term $a_{p_i} \ge 0$; for $\beta_j \le n \le \alpha_j$ they decrease, every step of the descent adding a term $a_{q_l} < 0$. Hence for every $n$ with $\alpha_{j-1} \le n \le \alpha_j$ one has $\min\{T_{\alpha_{j-1}}, T_{\alpha_j}\} \le T_n \le T_{\beta_j}$. [A1, step 4.3, step 10.1]

12.1 Put $\delta_j := \max\{a_{p_{i(j)}},\, |a_{q_{l(j)}}|\}$ for the two indices appearing in step 11.1 and step 11.2. As $j \to \infty$ those indices tend to infinity, by step 8.1 and step 9.2, so $p_{i(j)} \to \infty$ and $q_{l(j)} \to \infty$ by step 4.1, and $\delta_j \to 0$ by step 1.1. Thus $v_j < T_{\beta_j} \le v_j + \delta_j$ and $u_j - \delta_j \le T_{\alpha_j} < u_j$ for every $j \ge 1$. [step 1.1, step 4.1, step 8.1, step 9.2, step 11.1, step 11.2]

12.2 Fix $n$ and let $J$ be least with $\alpha_{J-1} \ge n$, which exists because the $\alpha_j$ are strictly increasing. By step 11.3 every $m \ge \alpha_{J-1}$ satisfies $T_m \le \sup\{T_{\beta_j} : j \ge J\}$, and only the finitely many indices $m$ with $n \le m < \alpha_{J-1}$ are unaccounted for; each of those lies in a round of index at most $J-1$ and so is at most $\max\{T_{\beta_j} : 1 \le j \le J-1\}$ together with $T_n$ itself. Hence $\sup\{T_m : m \ge n\}$ is finite or $+\infty$ according as $\sup\{T_{\beta_j} : j \ge J\}$ is, and taking the infimum over $n$, which drives $J$ to infinity, gives $\limsup_n T_n = \limsup_j T_{\beta_j}$. [step 10.1, step 11.3, L10]

13.1 Take $u_j = v_j = c$ for all $j$, which satisfies the two conditions of step 4.3. Then $c < T_{\beta_j} \le c + \delta_j$ and $c - \delta_j \le T_{\alpha_j} < c$, so by step 11.3 every $n$ with $\alpha_{j-1} \le n \le \alpha_j$ has $|T_n - c| \le \max\{\delta_{j-1}, \delta_j\}$. Given a real $\varepsilon > 0$, choose $J \ge 2$ with $\delta_j < \varepsilon$ for all $j \ge J-1$; then $|T_n - c| < \varepsilon$ for all $n \ge \alpha_{J-1}$, so $T_n \to c$ and the rearranged series converges with sum $c$. This is claim 1. [step 12.1, step 11.3, L8]

13.2 Take $v_j = j+1$ and $u_j = j$, which satisfy the two conditions. Then $T_{\alpha_j} \ge u_j - \delta_j = j - \delta_j$, so by step 11.3 every $n$ with $\alpha_{j-1} \le n \le \alpha_j$ has $T_n \ge \min\{j-1-\delta_{j-1},\, j - \delta_j\}$, a quantity that exceeds any prescribed real for all large $j$; hence $T_n \to +\infty$. Taking instead $v_j = -(j+1)$ and $u_j = -(j+2)$, which also satisfy the two conditions, gives $T_n \le T_{\beta_j} \le v_j + \delta_j = -(j+1) + \delta_j$ on the same ranges, hence $T_n \to -\infty$. This is claim 2. [step 12.1, step 11.3, L8]

13.3 By step 12.1 the subsequence $(T_{\beta_j})_{j \ge 1}$ tends to $\beta$ and $(T_{\alpha_j})_{j\ge1}$ tends to $\alpha$, in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$: when the target sequence is real-valued and convergent the two-sided bound of step 12.1 with $\delta_j \to 0$ gives it, and when the target sequence diverges the one-sided bound does. [step 12.1, step 5.4, L8, L11]

14.1 By step 13.3 and [L11], $\limsup_j T_{\beta_j} = \beta$; so $\limsup_n T_n = \beta$. The same argument applied to infima, with $\alpha_j$ in place of $\beta_j$ and the lower bound of step 11.3 in place of the upper one, gives $\liminf_n T_n = \liminf_j T_{\alpha_j} = \alpha$. [step 13.3, step 12.2, L10, L11]

15.1 The bijection $\sigma$ of step 5.3, built from the targets chosen in step 5.4, is therefore a rearrangement of $\sum a_k$ whose partial sums have limit inferior $\alpha$ and limit superior $\beta$; claims 1 and 2 are the special cases computed directly in step 13.1 and step 13.2, and claim 3 is the case $\alpha < \beta$. [step 9.1, step 13.1, step 13.2, step 14.1, discharge-construct] ∎

## Remarks

- **Only two properties of the series are used.** That both part series diverge to $+\infty$ ([[lem-positive-and-negative-parts]]), which is what keeps the two supplies inexhaustible, and that $a_k \to 0$ ([[lem-nth-term-test]]), which is what makes the overshoot at each turning point vanish. Both hold for every conditionally convergent series and neither holds for an absolutely convergent one, whose part series both converge.

- **Where the well-ordering principle is used, and where it is not.** It appears in step 2.1 and step 3.1, to define the increasing enumerations of $P$ and $N$, and in step 5.1. It does *not* appear in the greedy rule: "take terms until the running sum crosses the target" is implemented as a one-step recursion whose state carries the two counters, the round and the running sum, so no least crossing index is ever selected. No choice principle is used anywhere; every object is determined by the data.

- **Zero terms are not a special case.** They are collected into $P$, so a run of zeros is consumed during a climb without moving the running sum, and the climb still terminates because the tail sums of $\sum_i a_{p_i}$ are unbounded. Had $P$ been defined as $\{k : a_k > 0\}$, the zero-indexed terms would have had to be inserted separately for $\sigma$ to be surjective.

- **The oscillating case is genuinely more than the two divergences.** With $\alpha < \beta$ both finite, the partial sums visit every neighbourhood of $\alpha$ and of $\beta$ infinitely often and are eventually confined to a neighbourhood of $[\alpha, \beta]$; the subsequential limit set of $(T_n)$ is then the whole interval, though nothing on this page needs that refinement.
