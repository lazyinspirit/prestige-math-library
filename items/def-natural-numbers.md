## Definition

The set of **natural numbers** is the **smallest inductive set**
([[def-inductive-set]]),

$$\mathbb{N} = \omega := \bigcap\,\{\, I : I \text{ is inductive} \,\},$$

which exists and is itself inductive by [[lem-omega-smallest-inductive]] (the
Axiom of Infinity, [[def-axiom-of-infinity]], supplies one inductive set to
intersect within, and Separation, [[def-axiom-schema-of-separation]], makes the
intersection a set). On $\mathbb{N}$ we take

$$0 := \varnothing, \qquad \sigma(n) := n \cup \{n\},$$

the distinguished element and the successor function. Thus
$0 = \varnothing$, $1 = \{0\}$, $2 = \{0, 1\}$, $3 = \{0, 1, 2\}$, and in general
$n = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ is the set of its predecessors.

## Remarks

"Smallest" means $\omega \subseteq I$ for every inductive set $I$. This minimality
is exactly the **induction principle** ([[thm-induction-principle]]): a subset of
$\mathbb{N}$ that contains $0$ and is closed under $\sigma$ is itself inductive,
hence contains $\omega = \mathbb{N}$, hence equals $\mathbb{N}$.

With $0$ and $\sigma$ so defined, $(\mathbb{N}, 0, \sigma)$ satisfies the Peano
axioms ([[def-peano-system]], proved in [[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]), so it is a
**model** of the abstract natural numbers. By categoricity
([[thm-peano-categoricity]]) any other model is uniquely isomorphic to it, so the
particular set-theoretic encoding chosen here is immaterial to every arithmetic
and order property that follows: those are developed from the Peano axioms, not
from the sets themselves.
