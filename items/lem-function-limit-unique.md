## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$, let $c$ be a limit
point of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]) and let $L, L' \in \mathbb{R}$. If

$$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L \qquad \text{and} \qquad \lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L'$$

([[def-function-limit]]), then $L = L'$.

A function therefore has **at most one** limit at a limit point of its domain,
which is what licenses the notation $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ for a single real
number. This lemma is recorded in the `justified_by` field of
[[def-function-limit]] for exactly that reason.

**The hypothesis that $c$ is a limit point is not removable.** At an isolated
point of the domain the same $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula is satisfied
vacuously by every real at once, which is the content of
[[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$, a limit point $c$ of $A$, and reals $L, L'$ with $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$ and $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L'$ ([[def-function-limit]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L1] The limit condition: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$, and likewise with $L'$ in place of $L$ ([[def-function-limit]]).

[L2] Limit point: for every real $\delta > 0$ there is $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] Triangle inequality: $|u + v| \le |u| + |v|$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L4] Absolute value: $|u| \ge 0$; $|u| = 0$ if and only if $u = 0$; and $|-u| = |u|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L5] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: trichotomy, so $u \ne 0$ together with $|u| \ge 0$ and $|u| \ne 0$ forces $|u| > 0$, and $t < t$ is impossible; adding two strict inequalities ([[lem-of-add-order]]); $0 < 1$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]), hence $2 := 1 + 1 > 0$ and $2^{-1} > 0$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]), so $\eta/2 > 0$ and $(\eta/2) \cdot 2 = \eta$ whenever $\eta > 0$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]]); and of two positive reals the smaller is positive, the order being total.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $L \ne L'$. [assume-contra]

2.1 Then $L - L' \ne 0$, so $|L - L'| \ne 0$ while $|L - L'| \ge 0$, and trichotomy gives $|L - L'| > 0$; hence $\varepsilon := |L - L'|/2 > 0$ and $2\varepsilon = |L - L'|$. [step 1.1, L4, L5]

3.1 Applying [L1] twice with this $\varepsilon$, fix reals $\delta_1 > 0$ and $\delta_2 > 0$ such that every $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta_1$ has $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ and every $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta_2$ has $|f(x) - L'| < \varepsilon$; put $\delta$ to be the smaller of $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$, so $\delta > 0$. [step 2.1, L1, L5, choose]

4.1 Since $c$ is a limit point of $A$, fix $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$. [step 3.1, L2, choose]

5.1 That $x$ satisfies $0 < |x - c| < \delta_1$ and $0 < |x - c| < \delta_2$, hence both $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ and $|f(x) - L'| < \varepsilon$. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L1]

6.1 Therefore $|L - L'| = |(L - f(x)) + (f(x) - L')| \le |L - f(x)| + |f(x) - L'| = |f(x) - L| + |f(x) - L'| < \varepsilon + \varepsilon = 2\varepsilon = |L - L'|$. [step 5.1, L3, L4, L5]

7.1 So $|L - L'| < |L - L'|$, which trichotomy forbids; the assumption $L \ne L'$ is untenable, and hence $L = L'$. [step 6.1, L5, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where each hypothesis is spent.** The limit conditions are used only in step 5.1, and the limit-point hypothesis only in step 4.1, to produce a *single* point $x$ of the domain near $c$ at which both estimates can be read. Without such a point the two estimates never meet and nothing forces $L = L'$; that is the whole mechanism, and it is the reason [[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]] is false.

- **The sequential analogue** is [[lem-limit-unique]], proved by the same two-estimates-at-one-index argument. Neither statement uses any choice principle.

- **One-sided limits inherit this.** By [[def-one-sided-limits]] a one-sided limit is the limit of a restriction of $f$, so applying this lemma to that restriction gives uniqueness there too; nothing has to be reproved.
