## Statement

For all sets $a$ and $b$:

- (i) $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$;
- (ii) $\bigcup \{a\} = a$;
- (iii) $\bigcup \{a,b\} = a \cup b$, and $z \in a \cup b$ holds if and only if $z \in a$ or $z \in b$;
- (iv) $\bigcap \{a\} = a$;
- (v) $\bigcap \{a,b\} = a \cap b$, and $z \in a \cap b$ holds if and only if $z \in a$ and $z \in b$.

The equalities in (iii) and (v) are the definitions of $a \cup b$ and $a \cap b$
written out; what is proved about them here is the membership criterion beside
each.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** sets $a$ and $b$.

[L1] $\bigcup x$ is the set whose elements are exactly the elements of the elements of $x$, and $a \cup b := \bigcup\{a,b\}$ ([[def-union-of-a-set-and-binary-union]]).

[L2] For $x \neq \varnothing$, $\bigcap x$ is the set whose elements are exactly the sets belonging to every element of $x$, and $a \cap b := \bigcap\{a,b\}$ ([[def-intersection-of-a-set-and-binary-intersection]]).

[L3] $\{x,y\}$ is the set whose elements are exactly $x$ and $y$, and $\{x\} := \{x,x\}$ ([[def-unordered-pair-and-singleton]]).

[L4] There is exactly one set with no elements, written $\varnothing$ ([[thm-the-empty-set-exists-and-is-unique]]).

[L5] If every $z$ satisfies $z \in x$ if and only if $z \in y$, then $x = y$ ([[def-axiom-of-extensionality]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Claim (i): $z \in \bigcup \varnothing$ requires a member $s$ of $\varnothing$ with $z \in s$, and $\varnothing$ has no members, so $\bigcup \varnothing$ has no elements and is therefore $\varnothing$. [L1, L4]

1.2 Claim (ii): $z \in \bigcup \{a\}$ requires a member $s$ of $\{a\}$ with $z \in s$, and the only member of $\{a\}$ is $a$, so $z \in \bigcup\{a\}$ holds exactly when $z \in a$. [L1, L3]

1.3 Claim (iii): $a \cup b$ is $\bigcup\{a,b\}$ by definition, and $z \in \bigcup\{a,b\}$ requires a member $s$ of $\{a,b\}$ with $z \in s$; the members of $\{a,b\}$ are $a$ and $b$, so $z \in a \cup b$ holds exactly when $z \in a$ or $z \in b$. [L1, L3]

1.4 Claim (iv): $\{a\}$ is nonempty since $a$ is a member, and $z \in \bigcap\{a\}$ holds exactly when $z$ belongs to every member of $\{a\}$, that is, exactly when $z \in a$. [L2, L3]

1.5 Claim (v): $a \cap b$ is $\bigcap\{a,b\}$ by definition, $\{a,b\}$ is nonempty, and $z \in \bigcap\{a,b\}$ holds exactly when $z$ belongs to every member of $\{a,b\}$; the members are $a$ and $b$, so $z \in a \cap b$ holds exactly when $z \in a$ and $z \in b$. [L2, L3]

2.1 In each of the five claims the elements of the two sides have been shown to satisfy the same condition, so the sets are equal, which is the statement. [L5, step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, step 1.4, step 1.5] ∎
