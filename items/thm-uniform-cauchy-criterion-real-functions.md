## Statement

Let $X$ be a set and let $f_k:X\to\mathbb{R}$ for every
$k\in\mathbb{N}$. Then $(f_k)$ converges uniformly on $X$ to some
$f:X\to\mathbb{R}$ if and only if $(f_k)$ is uniformly Cauchy on $X$
([[def-pointwise-uniform-and-uniformly-cauchy-convergence]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $X$ and a sequence of functions $f_k:X\to\mathbb{R}$.

[A1] Uniform convergence to $f$ means that for every real $\varepsilon>0$ there is $N$ such that $|f_k(x)-f(x)|<\varepsilon$ for every $k\ge N$ and every $x\in X$ ([[def-pointwise-uniform-and-uniformly-cauchy-convergence]]).

[A2] Uniform Cauchyness means that for every real $\varepsilon>0$ there is $N$ such that $|f_m(x)-f_n(x)|<\varepsilon$ for every $m,n\ge N$ and every $x\in X$ ([[def-pointwise-uniform-and-uniformly-cauchy-convergence]]).

[A3] Pointwise convergence as defined through real sequences can equivalently be tested with every positive real error ([[def-pointwise-uniform-and-uniformly-cauchy-convergence]]).

[L1] For reals $u,v$, $|u+v|\le |u|+|v|$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L2] Every Cauchy sequence of reals converges to a real ([[thm-cauchy-criterion-via-lub]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Suppose first that $f_k\to f$ uniformly on $X$, and let $\varepsilon>0$ be real. By [A1] choose $N$ with $|f_j(x)-f(x)|<\varepsilon/2$ for every $j\ge N$ and $x\in X$. Thus, for $m,n\ge N$ and $x\in X$, $|f_m(x)-f_n(x)|\le |f_m(x)-f(x)|+|f(x)-f_n(x)|<\varepsilon$. Since $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary, $(f_k)$ is uniformly Cauchy. [A1, A2, L1, choose, algebra]

1.2 Conversely, suppose that $(f_k)$ is uniformly Cauchy on $X$. For each $x\in X$, [A2] makes $(f_k(x))$ a Cauchy real sequence; by [L2] it has a real limit $f(x)$. These values define a function $f:X\to\mathbb{R}$. [A2, L2, construct]

1.3 Under this converse assumption, let $\varepsilon>0$ be real and choose $N$ such that $|f_m(x)-f_n(x)|<\varepsilon/2$ for every $m,n\ge N$ and every $x\in X$. [A2, choose]

2.1 Fix $k\ge N$ and $x\in X$. Pointwise convergence at $x$ gives a threshold $M$ such that $|f_n(x)-f(x)|<\varepsilon/2$ for $n\ge M$. Choose $n\ge N,M$. Then $|f_k(x)-f(x)|\le |f_k(x)-f_n(x)|+|f_n(x)-f(x)|<\varepsilon$. [step 1.2, step 1.3, A3, L1, choose]

3.1 The index $N$ in step 1.3 is independent of $k$ and $x$, so step 2.1 proves $f_k\to f$ uniformly. Together with step 1.1 this proves both directions. [step 1.1, step 2.1, A1] ∎
