## Statement

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, let $\mathbb{R}^n$ be the set of functions
$n \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $d_2$ be the Euclidean metric on it
([[lem-metrics-on-rn]]). Then:

1. **Closed boxes are compact.** For reals $a_k \le b_k$ $(k < n)$ the box
   $Q = \{\, x \in \mathbb{R}^n : a_k \le x_k \le b_k \text{ for every } k < n \,\}$
   is a compact subset of $(\mathbb{R}^n, d_2)$ ([[def-metric-compactness]]).
2. **Heine-Borel.** A subset $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is a compact subset of
   $(\mathbb{R}^n, d_2)$ if and only if $K$ is closed in $\mathbb{R}^n$
   ([[def-metric-topology]]) and bounded
   ([[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]).
3. **The real line.** A subset $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a compact subset of
   $(\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$, the usual metric $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) = |x-y|$
   ([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]), if and only if $K$ is closed in
   $\mathbb{R}$ and bounded.

**No choice principle is used.** The bisection below halves one coordinate at a
time and takes the **left** half whenever the left half still fails to be finitely
covered, the right half otherwise: a rule with two outcomes, decided by a
property of the box, not a selection. That is the whole reason the theorem is
available in ZF, while the general "complete and totally bounded implies compact"
([[thm-complete-and-totally-bounded-implies-compact]]) is not.

The hypothesis $n \ge 1$ is inherited from [[lem-metrics-on-rn]], which defines
$\mathbb{R}^n$ and its metrics only there; the last remark below records what
happens at $n = 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural number $n \ge 1$, the metric space $(\mathbb{R}^n, d_2)$, and the notions of open, closed, bounded and compact subset in it.

[L1] $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the set of functions $n \to \mathbb{R}$, and $d_2(x,y) = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}(x_k-y_k)^2}$, $d_\infty(x,y) = \max\{|x_k - y_k| : k < n\}$ are metrics on it ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]], [[def-finite-sum]], [[def-metric-space]]).

[L2] Finite sums of nonnegative terms dominate each term and are monotone, and $\sum_{k<n} c = \iota(n)c$ for a constant $c$, $\iota(n)$ being the canonical natural of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[def-finite-sum]], [[def-canonical-natural]]).

[L3] For $a,b \ge 0$: $a \le b$ exactly when $a^2 \le b^2$; every $a \ge 0$ has a unique nonnegative square root; and $\sqrt{c^2} = |c|$ for every real $c$ ([[lem-of-square-monotone]], [[thm-of-square-roots]], [[def-abs-value]]).

[L4] A subset $A$ is compact exactly when every family $(U_i)_{i \in I}$ of open subsets of the ambient space with $A \subseteq \bigcup_{i \in I} U_i$ has finitely many members whose union contains $A$, or $A = \emptyset$; and the sets open in the subspace $A$ are exactly the traces on $A$ of the open subsets of the ambient space, so, taking complements inside $A$, the sets closed in $A$ are exactly the traces on $A$ of the closed subsets of the ambient space ([[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]], [[def-metric-compactness]], [[def-metric-topology]], [[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]).

[L5] A compact subset of a metric space is closed and bounded ([[thm-compact-subset-is-closed-and-bounded]]).

[L6] A closed subset of a compact metric space is compact ([[lem-closed-subset-of-a-compact-space-is-compact]]).

[L7] Nested closed bounded intervals $I_m = [\alpha_m,\beta_m]$ with $I_{m+1} \subseteq I_m$ have nonempty intersection, and the intersection is a single point exactly when the lengths tend to $0$ ([[thm-nested-interval-property]], [[def-interval]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L8] Recursion: for a set $A$, an element $a \in A$ and $f : A \to A$ there is a unique $g : \mathbb{N} \to A$ with $g(0) = a$ and $g(m+1) = f(g(m))$; a stage-dependent rule is handled on $A = \mathbb{N} \times Z$, the first coordinate of $g(m)$ then being $m$ ([[thm-recursion]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[L9] $(1/2)^m \to 0$, integer powers being those of [[def-integer-power]] ([[lem-geometric-sequence-null]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L10] A nonempty finite set of reals has a maximum, one of its members ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L11] $U$ is open exactly when every point of $U$ has a ball inside $U$; a subset is bounded when it is empty or lies in some ball $B(x_0,\rho)$ with $\rho > 0$ ([[def-metric-topology]], [[def-metric-ball]], [[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]).

[L12] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/N < \eta$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For $x,y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $k < n$ the term $(x_k-y_k)^2$ is one of the nonnegative terms of $\sum_{j<n}(x_j-y_j)^2$, so $(x_k-y_k)^2 \le d_2(x,y)^2$, and taking nonnegative square roots gives $|x_k - y_k| \le d_2(x,y)$; hence $d_\infty(x,y) \le d_2(x,y)$. [L1, L2, L3]

1.2 Conversely each $(x_j-y_j)^2 \le d_\infty(x,y)^2$, so $d_2(x,y)^2 \le \iota(n)\,d_\infty(x,y)^2 \le \big(\iota(n) d_\infty(x,y)\big)^2$, the last step because $\iota(n) \ge 1$; hence $d_2(x,y) \le \iota(n)\, d_\infty(x,y)$. [L1, L2, L3]

2.1 For claim 1 fix reals $a_k \le b_k$ $(k<n)$ and the box $Q$ they determine, let $(U_i)_{i \in I}$ be open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with $Q \subseteq \bigcup_{i \in I} U_i$, call a set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ **finitely covered** when finitely many of the $U_i$ have union containing $S$, and suppose for contradiction that $Q$ is not finitely covered. [L4, step 1.1, step 1.2, assume-contra]

3.1 For a box $P = \{\, x : c_j \le x_j \le e_j \ (j<n) \,\}$ with $c_j \le e_j$ and for $k < n$, let $P^{k,0}$ and $P^{k,1}$ be the boxes obtained by replacing the $k$-th interval $[c_k,e_k]$ by $[c_k, (c_k+e_k)/2]$ and by $[(c_k+e_k)/2, e_k]$; then $P = P^{k,0} \cup P^{k,1}$ by trichotomy applied to $x_k$ against the midpoint, the $k$-th side length of each is $(e_k-c_k)/2$ and the others are unchanged, and if both halves were finitely covered so would $P$ be, the union of two finite subfamilies being finite. Define $H_k(P) := P^{k,0}$ if $P^{k,0}$ is not finitely covered, and $H_k(P) := P^{k,1}$ otherwise; this is a definition by a property, and $H_k(P)$ is not finitely covered whenever $P$ is. [L7, step 2.1]

4.1 Recursion on $\mathbb{N} \times Z$, with $Z$ the set of functions from boxes to boxes, starting value $(0, \mathrm{id})$ and rule $(j, h) \mapsto (j+1,\ H_j \circ h)$ for $j < n$ and $(j,h) \mapsto (j+1,h)$ otherwise, produces $G_j$ for every $j$; put $G := G_n$. By induction on $j \le n$, $G_j(P) \subseteq P$ is a box whose $k$-th side is half that of $P$ for $k < j$ and equal to that of $P$ for $k \ge j$, and $G_j(P)$ is not finitely covered when $P$ is not. So $G(P) \subseteq P$ halves every side and preserves not being finitely covered. [L8, step 3.1]

5.1 Recursion applied to the starting value $Q$ and the rule $G$ produces boxes $P_m$ with $P_0 = Q$ and $P_{m+1} = G(P_m)$; each $P_m$ fails to be finitely covered, $P_{m+1} \subseteq P_m$, and the $k$-th side length of $P_m$ is $\ell_k (1/2)^m$, where $\ell_k := b_k - a_k \ge 0$. [L8, step 4.1]

6.1 For each $k < n$ the $k$-th intervals of the $P_m$ form a nested family of closed bounded intervals whose lengths $\ell_k(1/2)^m$ tend to $0$, so their intersection is a single point $p_k$; the function $p : n \to \mathbb{R}$, $k \mapsto p_k$, is a point of $\mathbb{R}^n$ lying in every $P_m$. [L7, L9, step 5.1]

7.1 Since $p \in P_0 = Q \subseteq \bigcup_{i \in I} U_i$, there is $i^{\ast} \in I$ with $p \in U_{i^{\ast}}$, and openness gives a real $r > 0$ with $B(p,r) \subseteq U_{i^{\ast}}$. [L11, step 6.1]

8.1 Put $L := \max\{\ell_k : k < n\} \ge 0$ and $C := \iota(n) L + 1 > 0$; for $x \in P_m$ each $|x_k - p_k|$ is at most the $k$-th side length of $P_m$, so $d_\infty(x,p) \le L (1/2)^m$ and $d_2(x,p) \le \iota(n) L (1/2)^m \le C (1/2)^m$ by step 1.2. Taking a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/N < r/C$ and then $m$ with $(1/2)^m < 1/N$ gives $P_m \subseteq B(p,r) \subseteq U_{i^{\ast}}$, so $P_m$ is finitely covered by the single set $U_{i^{\ast}}$, contradicting step 5.1. [L9, L10, L12, step 1.2, step 5.1, step 6.1, step 7.1, discharge-contradiction]

9.1 Therefore every such family has finitely many members covering $Q$, and $Q$ is a compact subset of $(\mathbb{R}^n,d_2)$: claim 1 is proved. [L4, step 2.1, step 8.1]

10.1 For claim 2, a compact $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is closed and bounded. [L5, step 9.1]

11.1 Conversely let $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ be closed and bounded; if $K = \emptyset$ it is compact, and otherwise $K \subseteq B(x_0,\rho)$ for some $x_0$ and real $\rho > 0$, so every $x \in K$ and $k < n$ satisfy $|x_k| \le |(x_0)_k| + |x_k - (x_0)_k| \le |(x_0)_k| + d_2(x,x_0) < |(x_0)_k| + \rho$ by step 1.1; with $M := \max\{|(x_0)_k| : k < n\} + \rho$ the box $Q_M := \{\, x : -M \le x_k \le M \ (k<n) \,\}$ contains $K$. [L10, L11, step 1.1, step 10.1]

12.1 $K$ is the trace on $Q_M$ of a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, namely of $K$ itself, so $K$ is closed in the metric subspace $Q_M$; that subspace is compact by step 9.1, so $K$ is compact, and claim 2 is proved. [L4, L6, step 9.1, step 11.1]

13.1 For claim 3, let $\psi : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^1$ send $t$ to the function $1 \to \mathbb{R}$ with value $t$; it is a bijection and $d_2(\psi(s),\psi(t)) = \sqrt{(s-t)^2} = |s-t| = d_{\mathbb{R}}(s,t)$, so $\psi$ carries each ball onto the corresponding ball, hence open sets onto open sets and open covers onto open covers with matching finite subfamilies, and likewise closed sets onto closed sets and bounded sets onto bounded sets. Applying claim 2 with $n = 1$ to $\psi[K]$ therefore gives claim 3. [L1, L3, L4, L11, step 12.1] ∎

## Remarks

**Why the bisection halves one coordinate at a time.** Halving all $n$ coordinates at once produces $2^n$ sub-boxes, and choosing one of them canonically means enumerating them, which needs a bijection between the functions $n \to \{0,1\}$ and a natural number. Halving a single coordinate produces two sub-boxes, and "the left one if it is still not finitely covered, the right one otherwise" is a definition by cases needing nothing at all. Composing $n$ such halvings, as step 4.1 does, recovers the full halving of every side and keeps the construction canonical, which is what a choice-free proof requires.

**Where each hypothesis is used.** Closedness enters only at step 12.1, through [[lem-closed-subset-of-a-compact-space-is-compact]]; boundedness enters only at step 11.1, to fit $K$ inside a box. Dropping either leaves a non-compact set: the whole of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is closed and unbounded, and an open ball is bounded and not closed, and neither is compact by claim 2.

**The converse direction is what fails in a general metric space.** Claim 2 says that in $\mathbb{R}^n$ closed and bounded is enough; that is special to $\mathbb{R}^n$, and [[fs-closed-and-bounded-implies-compact-in-every-metric-space]] records the false general statement together with a witness. What survives in every metric space is only the direction of step 10.1 ([[thm-compact-subset-is-closed-and-bounded]]).

**The case $n = 0$.** $\mathbb{R}^0$ has exactly one element, the empty function, and [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] does not treat it, because $d_\infty$ would be a maximum over the empty index set. On a one-element set the only metric is the one taking the value $0$, and the resulting space is compact for trivial reasons: it is listed as $\{x_0\}$, and any family of open sets covering it has a member containing $x_0$ ([[def-metric-compactness]]). Nothing above is needed for that case and nothing above claims it.
