## Definition

For bounded $E\subseteq\mathbb R^m$, in the metric sense of [[def-metric-bounded-diameter]], its **Jordan outer content** is the infimum of $\sum_{r<q}\operatorname{vol}(R_r)$ over finite axis-parallel rectangle covers of $E$. Its **Jordan inner content** is the supremum of the same sums over finite families of rectangles contained in $E$ whose interiors are pairwise disjoint.

Metric boundedness always supplies a nondegenerate bounding rectangle. For
nonempty $E$, choose $x_0\in\mathbb R^m$ and $r>0$ with
$E\subseteq B(x_0,r)$. Since
$|x_j-(x_0)_j|\le d_\infty(x,x_0)\le d_2(x,x_0)<r$ for every coordinate
([[lem-metrics-on-rn]], [[lem-every-norm-on-rn-is-continuous-for-the-euclidean-metric]] clause 3, [[def-metric-ball]]), the nondegenerate box
$\prod_{j<m}[(x_0)_j-r,(x_0)_j+r]$ contains $E$. The empty set lies in
any fixed nondegenerate rectangle.

Thus the outer family is nonempty and the same bounding rectangle bounds the
inner sums; the empty family gives inner sum $0$. Refining all listed
endpoints into one grid and splitting the nested finite sums shows every
inscribed sum is at most every covering sum
([[def-multidimensional-grid-partition]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).
Completeness therefore supplies finite real extrema
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]],
[[lem-sup-unique]]).

The set is **Jordan measurable** when the contents agree, and their common value is its **Jordan content**. The empty set and every degenerate rectangle have content $0$.
