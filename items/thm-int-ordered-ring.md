## Statement

The relation of [[def-int-order]] is well defined and is a total order on
$\mathbb{Z}$; it is compatible with addition ($x \le y$ implies
$x + z \le y + z$) and positives are closed under multiplication
($0 < x$ and $0 < y$ imply $0 < xy$). Thus $\mathbb{Z}$ is a totally
ordered commutative ring.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Integers $x = [(a,b)]$, $y = [(c,d)]$, $z = [(e,f)]$ with the operations of [[def-int-operations]].

[L1] Addition on $\mathbb{N}$ is commutative and associative ([[lem-nat-add-commutative]], [[lem-nat-add-associative]]).

[L2] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total, antisymmetric, and transitive ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

[L3] Natural order is translation-invariant: $x\le y\iff x+z\le y+z$ ([[lem-nat-order-add-compatible]]).

[L4] By the definition of natural order, $x\le y$ exactly when $y=x+k$ for some natural $k$; if $x<y$, such a gap is nonzero ([[def-nat-order]]).

[L5] Natural multiplication is commutative and associative, distributes over addition, and has the usual zero and identity laws; multiplication by a nonzero natural preserves strict order ([[lem-nat-mult-commutative]], [[lem-nat-mult-associative]], [[lem-nat-mult-distributive]], [[lem-nat-mult-identity]], [[lem-nat-order-mult-compatible]]).

[L6] The integer operations make $\mathbb{Z}$ a commutative ring with multiplicative identity ([[thm-int-comm-ring]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Suppose $(a,b) \sim (a',b')$ and $(c,d) \sim (c',d')$, i.e. $a + b' = b + a'$ and $c + d' = d + c'$. [given]

1.2 Suppose $a + d \le b + c$. [given]

1.3 Totality: in $\mathbb{N}$ either $a + d \le b + c$ or $b + c \le a + d$, so $x \le y$ or $y \le x$. [L2]

1.4 Antisymmetry: $x \le y$ and $y \le x$ give $a + d \le b + c$ and $b + c \le a + d$, hence $a + d = b + c$, which is $x = y$ as classes. [L2]

1.5 Transitivity: from $a + d \le b + c$ and $c + f \le d + e$, adding gives $(a+d)+(c+f) \le (b+c)+(d+e)$; regrouping, $(a+f)+(c+d) \le (b+e)+(c+d)$; cancelling, $a + f \le b + e$, i.e. $x \le z$. [L1, L2, L3]

1.6 Compatibility with addition: $x + z \le y + z$ reads $(a+e)+(d+f) \le (b+f)+(c+e)$, which regroups to $(a+d) + (e+f) \le (b+c) + (e+f)$, equivalent to $a + d \le b + c$, i.e. $x \le y$. [L1, L3]

1.7 Suppose $0 < x$ and $0 < y$, i.e. $b < a$ and $d < c$. [given]

2.1 Adding $(a'+d')$: $(a+d) + (a'+d') \le (b+c) + (a'+d')$. [step 1.2, L3]

2.2 Regrouping with the equations of step 1.1: $(b+c) + (a'+d') = (b+a') + (c+d') = (a+b') + (d+c') = (a+d) + (b'+c')$. [step 1.1, L1]

2.3 Write $a = b + k$ and $c = d + m$ with nonzero naturals $k,m$. [step 1.7, L4]

3.1 So $(a+d) + (a'+d') \le (a+d) + (b'+c')$; cancelling $(a+d)$ gives $a'+d'\le b'+c'$. Applying the same argument with primed and unprimed representatives exchanged proves the converse implication, so the relation is independent of representatives. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, L3]

3.2 Expanding both components of $xy = [(ac+bd,\, ad+bc)]$: $ac + bd = (b+k)(d+m) + bd = (bd + bm + kd + bd) + km$ and $ad + bc = (b+k)d + b(d+m) = bd + kd + bd + bm$, so $ac + bd = (ad + bc) + km$. [step 2.3, L1, L5]

4.1 Since $k,m$ are nonzero, $0<k$ and $0<m$ by [L4]. Hence [L5] gives $0=0\cdot m<km$, and step 3.2 yields $ad+bc<ac+bd$, which is $0<xy$. [step 2.3, step 3.2, L2, L4, L5]

5.1 The order is well defined, total, compatible with addition, and positives are closed under multiplication; together with [L6], this makes $\mathbb{Z}$ a totally ordered commutative ring. [step 3.1, step 1.3, step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6, step 4.1, L6] ∎
