## Definition

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]) and let $X$ be any set. Write

$$F^{X} \;:=\; \{\, f \;:\; f \text{ is a function } X \to F \,\},$$

and for $f \in F^{X}$ write $f(x)$ for its value at $x \in X$. Two elements of
$F^{X}$ are equal exactly when they agree at every point of $X$. Define

$$(f + g)(x) \;:=\; f(x) + g(x), \qquad (\lambda f)(x) \;:=\; \lambda\, f(x), \qquad 0_{F^{X}}(x) \;:=\; 0_F,$$

for $f, g \in F^{X}$, $\lambda \in F$ and $x \in X$, the operations on the right
being those of $F$. These are the **pointwise** operations.

**These rules really are the required data.** For $f, g \in F^{X}$ the assignment
$x \mapsto f(x) + g(x)$ is a function $X \to F$, so $+$ is a binary operation
$F^{X} \times F^{X} \to F^{X}$ ([[def-binary-operation]]); for $\lambda \in F$ and
$f \in F^{X}$ the assignment $x \mapsto \lambda f(x)$ is a function $X \to F$, so
scalar multiplication is a map $F \times F^{X} \to F^{X}$; and $0_{F^{X}}$, the
constant function at $0_F$, is an element of $F^{X}$.

**$F^{X}$ is a vector space over $F$** ([[def-vector-space]]). Each axiom is an
equation between elements of $F^{X}$, hence holds exactly when it holds at every
$x \in X$ after evaluation, and there it is the corresponding field axiom applied
to the values $f(x), g(x), \lambda, \mu$:

- associativity and commutativity of $+$, and $f + 0_{F^{X}} = f$, come from the
  same laws for $+$ in $F$; the additive inverse of $f$ is $x \mapsto -f(x)$,
  which lies in $F^{X}$ and satisfies $f + (-f) = 0_{F^{X}}$ pointwise. This is
  axiom (V1);
- $\bigl(\lambda(f+g)\bigr)(x) = \lambda(f(x)+g(x)) = \lambda f(x) + \lambda g(x)$
  is (V2), by distributivity in $F$;
- $\bigl((\lambda+\mu)f\bigr)(x) = (\lambda+\mu)f(x) = \lambda f(x) + \mu f(x)$ is
  (V3), by distributivity in $F$;
- $\bigl((\lambda\mu)f\bigr)(x) = (\lambda\mu)f(x) = \lambda(\mu f(x))$ is (V4),
  by associativity of multiplication in $F$;
- $(1_F f)(x) = 1_F f(x) = f(x)$ is (V5), by the multiplicative identity law
  in $F$.

### The case $X = n$

A natural number is a von Neumann natural ([[def-natural-numbers]]), that is a
set, and $n = \{\, m \in \mathbb{N} : m < n \,\} = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$
([[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]). Taking $X = n$ therefore gives

$$F^{n} \;=\; \{\, x \;:\; x \text{ is a function } n \to F \,\},$$

whose elements are written $x = (x_0, x_1, \dots, x_{n-1})$ with $x_i := x(i)$ for
$i < n$. **The coordinates are indexed from $0$**, because $0 \in n$ whenever
$n \ne 0$ and $n \notin n$ always. The operations read

$$(x + y)_i = x_i + y_i, \qquad (\lambda x)_i = \lambda x_i \qquad (i < n),$$

and the zero of $F^{n}$ is the tuple all of whose coordinates are $0_F$.

**The two boundary cases.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$, so $n = 0$ is a genuine
case. Since $0 = \varnothing$, the set $F^{0} = F^{\varnothing}$ has exactly one
element, the empty function; that element is $0_{F^{0}}$, so $F^{0}$ is the
**zero space** $\{0_{F^{0}}\}$, not the empty set. For $n = 1$ we have
$1 = \{0\}$, and the map $F^{1} \to F$ sending $x$ to its single coordinate $x_0$
is a bijection satisfying $(x+y)_0 = x_0 + y_0$ and $(\lambda x)_0 = \lambda x_0$;
we use it to read $F^{1}$ as $F$ where convenient. (No general notion of
isomorphism of vector spaces is available on this page, and none is claimed here:
what is asserted is exactly the displayed bijection and the two displayed
equations.)

## Remarks

- **The same set $F^{X}$ also carries a ring structure, and the two must not be
  conflated.** For a ring $R$ and a set $X$, [[def-ring-of-functions]] equips the
  set $R^{X}$ of all functions $X \to R$ with pointwise addition and pointwise
  multiplication. Taking $R = F$, the underlying set is literally the same set
  $F^{X}$ as here, and **the addition is literally the same operation**,
  $(f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)$ in both. What differs is the second operation:

  | | second operation | type |
  |---|---|---|
  | ring of functions | $(fg)(x) = f(x)\,g(x)$ | $F^{X} \times F^{X} \to F^{X}$ |
  | vector space (here) | $(\lambda f)(x) = \lambda\, f(x)$ | $F \times F^{X} \to F^{X}$ |

  Neither is a special case of the other, since they do not even have the same
  domain: one multiplies two functions, the other multiplies a function by a
  scalar. They agree in the following sense, and this is the whole of the
  relation between them: for $\lambda \in F$ let $c_\lambda \in F^{X}$ be the
  constant function at $\lambda$; then $\lambda f$ and the ring product
  $c_\lambda f$ have the same value $\lambda f(x)$ at every $x$, so they are
  equal. Both structures are present on $F^{X}$ at once, and nothing on this page
  uses the ring product.

- **Why $F^{n}$ is defined this way rather than as "$n$-tuples".** An $n$-tuple is
  already a function on an index set, and taking that index set to be the natural
  number $n$ itself makes the coordinates, the finite sums of
  [[def-monoid-finite-product]] and the induction arguments below all run over the
  same object. The price is that every index starts at $0$, and that $F^{0}$ is a
  one-element space; both are recorded above so that no statement on this page or
  its companion is quietly restricted to $n \ge 1$.

- **$X$ is arbitrary.** Nothing above assumes $X$ finite, countable, or nonempty.
  The case $X = \mathbb{N}$ gives the space of all families of scalars indexed by
  $\mathbb{N}$, and the case $X = m \times n$ gives the matrices of
  [[def-matrix-space]].
