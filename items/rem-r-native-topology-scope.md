This page builds the topology of $\mathbb{R}$ out of the order and the absolute
value alone: a neighbourhood is an interval ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), and open
and closed are defined from neighbourhoods ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]). Some
of what follows uses nothing else about $\mathbb{R}$, and some of it is written
in order vocabulary from beginning to end. This remark separates the two, so a
reader knows which results are candidates for reuse elsewhere and which are not
even statable elsewhere. **It asserts nothing about topological spaces in
general: this library does not develop them, and no claim about them is made or
needed here.**

**Results that use only the definitions.** [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]] and
[[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] use openness, closedness, closure and the
nesting property of neighbourhoods, together with the comparison of two positive
radii, and nothing beyond that. Neither the least-upper-bound property nor the
Archimedean property appears in either proof, and their statements mention no
interval, no bound and no order, so those statements would still make sense
wherever a notion of neighbourhood is available, however it arises.

**Results that cannot be separated from the order of $\mathbb{R}$.** Four
results on this page depend on the order. For the first three the order is in
what they say and not merely in how they are proved; for the fourth it is in the
proof only, and the bullet says so.

- [[thm-open-subsets-of-r-structure]] says that an open set is a countable
  disjoint union of **open intervals**. An interval is defined by the order
  ([[def-interval]]), the components are the classes of an equivalence relation
  defined by order-convexity, and the identification of a component as an
  interval is carried out with $\sup$ and $\inf$. Delete the order and there is
  no statement left to prove.
- [[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]] characterises connectedness by
  **order-convexity**. Connectedness itself is defined without the order
  ([[def-connected-r]]), but the property it is being equated with is an order
  property, so the theorem is a bridge between an order notion and a topological
  one and exists only where both are present.
- [[thm-heine-borel-r]] and [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]] speak of
  **closed bounded intervals** and of **bounded** sets. Boundedness is an order
  notion ([[def-bounded-set]]), and the proof of the first is a bisection, which
  uses the midpoint and hence the field operations as well. The completeness of
  $\mathbb{R}$ enters through [[thm-nested-interval-property]].
- [[thm-compact-iff-sequentially-compact-r]] routes **both** implications
  through the previous item, whose backward half spends the least-upper-bound
  property, and its **forward** implication additionally uses
  [[thm-bolzano-weierstrass]], which spends that property again; the backward
  implication does not use Bolzano-Weierstrass at all. Its statement mentions
  only compactness and sequences ([[def-open-cover-r]]), so unlike the three
  above it *is* statable without an order; the dependence lies entirely in the
  proof. This library provides no other proof, so nothing here licenses the
  equivalence outside $\mathbb{R}$.

**Where the dependence on completeness is visible rather than merely present.**
[[fs-closed-bounded-compact-without-completeness]] refutes, inside this library,
the claim that closed and bounded implies compact in an arbitrary ordered field,
and [[cex-closed-bounded-in-q-not-compact]] names the witness in $\mathbb{Q}$.
That is the sharpest statement this page makes about the limits of its own
results: the Heine-Borel characterisation is not a formal consequence of the
definitions, and it fails in the nearest ordered field that is not complete.

**What is deliberately not claimed.** Whether the results above have analogues in
a setting with a topology and no order, and whether compactness and sequential
compactness agree there, are questions about general topological spaces. This
library contains no such spaces, proves nothing about them, and the reader should
take no assertion about them from this page. What is claimed here is narrower and
is checkable line by line against the proofs: in the four results listed above,
the order of $\mathbb{R}$ is used, and in three of them it is used in the
statement itself.
