## Statement

Let $S$ be the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set ([[def-fat-cantor-set]]). Then:

1. $S$ is closed and bounded, hence compact
   ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]]);
2. $S$ is perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]);
3. $S$ is nowhere dense ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]]);
4. if $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ are sequences of reals with $a_k \le b_k$,
   $S \subseteq \bigcup_k [a_k,b_k]$ and $\sum_{k<i}(b_k - a_k) \le M$ for every
   $i \in \mathbb{N}$, then $M \ge 2^{-1}$.

In particular $S$ does **not** have measure zero
([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]): no cover of $S$ by intervals has total
length below $2^{-1}$, let alone below every positive $\varepsilon$.

**Claim 4 is the quantitative form**, and it is what claim 4 of the title asserts
in the only vocabulary available here. This library defines no outer measure, so
"the measure of $S$ is $1/2$" is not a statement it can make; what it can state,
and what is proved below, is that $2^{-1}$ is a lower bound for the total length
of every interval cover of $S$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The lengths $(\lambda_n)$, the gaps $g_n = \lambda_n - \lambda_{n+1}$, the finite lists $(N_n, \ell^{(n)})$ with entries $e^{(n)}_j$, and the sets $S_n$, $S$ of [[def-fat-cantor-set]]. For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $j < N_n$ write $M^{(n)}_j := \big(e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_{n+1},\ e^{(n)}_j + g_n\big)$ for the open interval removed from the $j$-th piece at stage $n$.

[A1] The negation of claim 4: sequences $(a_k)$, $(b_k)$ with $a_k \le b_k$, $S \subseteq \bigcup_k [a_k,b_k]$, all partial sums $\sum_{k<i}(b_k - a_k) \le M$, and $M < 2^{-1}$.

[L1] The construction: $N_0 = 1$, $e^{(0)}_0 = 0$, $\lambda_0 = 1$, $N_{n+1} = N_n + N_n$, $e^{(n+1)}_j = e^{(n)}_j$ for $j < N_n$ and $e^{(n+1)}_{N_n + j} = e^{(n)}_j + g_n$ for $j < N_n$; $S_n = \bigcup_{j<N_n}[e^{(n)}_j, e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n]$; $S = \bigcap_n S_n \subseteq S_m \subseteq [0,1]$; $0 < \lambda_{n+1} < g_n < \lambda_n \le 2^{-n}$; $g_n + \lambda_{n+1} = \lambda_n$; $\lambda_n - 2\lambda_{n+1} = 4^{-n-1}$; and $\sum_{j<N_n} c = 2^{n}c$ for every real $c$ ([[def-fat-cantor-set]], [[def-interval]], [[def-integer-power]], [[lem-power-laws]]).

[L2] $[c,d]$ is a closed set, $(c,d)$ is open, $N_\varepsilon(x) = (x-\varepsilon,x+\varepsilon)$, a closed bounded interval is bounded, finite unions of closed sets are closed and an intersection of a nonempty family of closed sets is closed ([[def-interval]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-bounded-set]], [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]).

[L3] A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is compact exactly when it is closed and bounded ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L4] Perfect means closed with no isolated point; nowhere dense means the interior of the closure is empty, and a closed set equals its closure ([[def-perfect-set-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-nowhere-dense-meager]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]]).

[L5] If $[u,v] \subseteq \bigcup_k [c_k,d_k]$ with $u \le v$, $c_k \le d_k$ and $\sum_{k<i}(d_k - c_k) \le M'$ for every $i$, then $M' \ge v - u$ ([[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]]).

[L6] There is a bijection $J : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-n-cross-n-countable]], [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L7] Finite sums: splitting, scaling, monotonicity in the terms; a finite sum of nonnegative terms indexed injectively inside a finite rectangle is at most the sum over the rectangle ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L8] $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} 2^{-n} = 2$, every partial sum of a nonnegative series is at most its sum, and $2^{-n} \to 0$ ([[thm-geometric-series]], [[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]], [[def-series]], [[lem-geometric-sequence-null]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L9] Induction on $\mathbb{N}$; every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element; every finite list of naturals has an upper bound in $\mathbb{N}$, the order of $\mathbb{N}$ being total ([[thm-induction-principle]], [[thm-well-ordering-principle]], [[lem-nat-trichotomy]], [[def-nat-order]]).

[L10] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 > 0$ and $4 > 0$ and $2^{-1} > 0$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve an inequality; the order is total and transitive ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that claim 4 fails, and fix $(a_k)$, $(b_k)$ and $M$ as in [A1], so that $M < 2^{-1}$. [assume-contra, given, A1, choose]

1.2 **$S$ is compact, claim 1.** Each $S_n$ is the union of the finite list of closed sets $[e^{(n)}_j, e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n]$, $j < N_n$, hence closed by [L2]; so $S = \bigcap_n S_n$ is closed by [L2], and $S \subseteq [0,1]$ is bounded by [L1] and [L2]; by [L3] it is compact. [L1, L2, L3]

1.3 **Separation.** For every $n$ and all $i \ne j$ below $N_n$ one has $|e^{(n)}_i - e^{(n)}_j| > \lambda_n$, by induction on $n$ ([L9]). At $n = 0$ there is nothing to prove, since $N_0 = 1$. Assume it at $n$ and let $i \ne j$ below $N_{n+1} = N_n + N_n$. If both indices are $< N_n$, or both are $\ge N_n$, the two entries are $e^{(n)}_{i'}$ and $e^{(n)}_{j'}$ with $i' \ne j'$, possibly both shifted by the same $g_n$, so the difference has absolute value $> \lambda_n > \lambda_{n+1}$ by [L1]. Otherwise the entries are $e^{(n)}_{i'}$ and $e^{(n)}_{j'} + g_n$; if $i' = j'$ the difference is $g_n > \lambda_{n+1}$ by [L1]; if $e^{(n)}_{i'} - e^{(n)}_{j'} > \lambda_n$ then $e^{(n)}_{i'} - e^{(n)}_{j'} - g_n > \lambda_n - g_n = \lambda_{n+1}$, and if $e^{(n)}_{j'} - e^{(n)}_{i'} > \lambda_n$ then $e^{(n)}_{j'} + g_n - e^{(n)}_{i'} > \lambda_n > \lambda_{n+1}$, in each case by [L1] and [L10]. Consequently the pieces $[e^{(n)}_j, e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n]$, $j < N_n$, are pairwise disjoint. [L1, L9, L10]

1.4 **Every endpoint lies in $S$.** Fix $n$ and $j < N_n$. For $m \le n$ one has $e^{(n)}_j$ and $e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n$ in $S_n \subseteq S_m$ by [L1]. For $m \ge n$, an induction on $m$ ([L9]) gives indices $j', j'' < N_m$ with $e^{(m)}_{j'} = e^{(n)}_j$ and $e^{(m)}_{j''} + \lambda_m = e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n$: at $m = n$ take $j' = j'' = j$; and if they exist at $m$, then $e^{(m+1)}_{j'} = e^{(m)}_{j'}$ works for the left endpoint, while $e^{(m+1)}_{N_m + j''} + \lambda_{m+1} = e^{(m)}_{j''} + g_m + \lambda_{m+1} = e^{(m)}_{j''} + \lambda_m$ works for the right one, by [L1]. So both points lie in every $S_m$, hence in $S$. [L1, L9]

1.5 **The complement decomposes over the stages.** $[0,1] \setminus S = \bigcup_{n}(S_n \setminus S_{n+1})$. The inclusion $\supseteq$ holds because $S_n \subseteq S_0 = [0,1]$ and $S \subseteq S_{n+1}$ by [L1]. For $\subseteq$, let $x \in [0,1] \setminus S$; then $x \in S_0$ and, $S$ being $\bigcap_m S_m$, the set of $m$ with $x \notin S_m$ is nonempty, so by [L9] it has a least element $m_0$, and $m_0 \ge 1$ since $x \in S_0$. Put $n := m_0 - 1$; then $x \in S_n$ by minimality and $x \notin S_{n+1}$. [L1, L9]

2.1 **The removed pieces.** Fix $n$ and $j < N_n$. By [L1] the pieces $[e^{(n)}_j, e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_{n+1}]$ and $[e^{(n)}_j + g_n,\ e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n]$ both occur among the pieces of $S_{n+1}$, so a point $x$ of $[e^{(n)}_j, e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n]$ outside $S_{n+1}$ satisfies $\lambda_{n+1} < x - e^{(n)}_j < g_n$, that is $x \in M^{(n)}_j$; hence $S_n \setminus S_{n+1} \subseteq \bigcup_{j<N_n} M^{(n)}_j$. Conversely $M^{(n)}_j \cap S_{n+1} = \varnothing$: a piece of $S_{n+1}$ coming from $i \ne j$ lies in $[e^{(n)}_i, e^{(n)}_i + \lambda_n]$, which is disjoint from $[e^{(n)}_j, e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n] \supseteq M^{(n)}_j$ by step 1.3, while the two pieces coming from $j$ itself are disjoint from the open interval $M^{(n)}_j$ by [L10]. Finally each $M^{(n)}_j$ has length $g_n - \lambda_{n+1} = \lambda_n - 2\lambda_{n+1} = 4^{-n-1}$, so $\sum_{j<N_n} 4^{-n-1} = 2^{n} \cdot 4^{-n-1} = 4^{-1} \cdot 2^{-n}$ by [L1]. [step 1.3, L1, L10]

2.2 **$S$ is perfect, claim 2.** $S$ is closed by step 1.2. Let $x \in S$ and let the real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given; by [L1] and [L8] fix $n$ with $\lambda_n \le 2^{-n} < \varepsilon$. Since $x \in S_n$ there is $j < N_n$ with $x \in [e^{(n)}_j, e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n]$; the two endpoints of that piece lie in $S$ by step 1.4, are distinct because $\lambda_n > 0$, and each is within $\lambda_n < \varepsilon$ of $x$ by [L10]. So at least one of them is a point of $S \cap N_\varepsilon(x)$ different from $x$, and $x$ is not isolated in $S$; by [L4], $S$ is perfect. [step 1.2, step 1.4, L1, L4, L8, L10]

3.1 **$S$ is nowhere dense, claim 3.** $S$ is closed by step 1.2, so it equals its closure, and by [L4] it suffices that its interior be empty. Suppose $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq S$ for some $x$ and some real $\varepsilon > 0$; fix $n$ with $\lambda_n \le 2^{-n} < \varepsilon$ by [L1] and [L8], and $j < N_n$ with $x \in [e^{(n)}_j, e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n]$. The point $w := e^{(n)}_j + (\lambda_{n+1} + g_n) \cdot 2^{-1}$ lies in $M^{(n)}_j$, since $\lambda_{n+1} < g_n$, and hence in $[e^{(n)}_j, e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n]$, so $|w - x| \le \lambda_n < \varepsilon$ and $w \in N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq S \subseteq S_{n+1}$; but $M^{(n)}_j \cap S_{n+1} = \varnothing$ by step 2.1, which is impossible. So no neighbourhood is contained in $S$ and $S$ is nowhere dense. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L1, L4, L8, L10]

3.2 **A cover of $[0,1]$ built from [A1] and the removed pieces.** By [L6] fix a bijection $J$ and define sequences $(c_i)$, $(d_i)$ as follows: for $i \in \mathbb{N}$ write $(m, t) := J^{-1}(i)$; if $m = 0$ put $(c_i, d_i) := (a_t, b_t)$; if $m \ge 1$ and $t < N_{m-1}$ put $(c_i,d_i) := \big(e^{(m-1)}_t + \lambda_{m}, \ e^{(m-1)}_t + g_{m-1}\big)$; and otherwise put $(c_i,d_i) := (0,0)$. Then $c_i \le d_i$ for every $i$ by [L1], and $\bigcup_i [c_i,d_i]$ contains $S$ by [A1] and contains $[0,1] \setminus S$ by steps 1.5 and 2.1, hence contains $[0,1]$. For a partial sum, fix $i_0$; the pairs $J^{-1}(i)$ with $i < i_0$ are distinct, so by [L9] there is $P$ bounding both of their coordinates, and since all the terms are nonnegative [L7] gives $\sum_{i<i_0}(d_i - c_i) \le \sum_{t \le P}(b_t - a_t) + \sum_{n \le P}\sum_{t < N_n} 4^{-n-1} \le M + \sum_{n\le P} 4^{-1}2^{-n} \le M + 4^{-1} \cdot 2 = M + 2^{-1}$, using [A1], step 2.1, [L7] and [L8]. [step 1.1, step 1.5, step 2.1, A1, L1, L6, L7, L8, L9]

4.1 By [L5] applied to $[0,1]$ and the cover of step 3.2, $M + 2^{-1} \ge 1 - 0 = 1$, so $M \ge 2^{-1}$, contradicting step 1.1. Claim 4 therefore holds; and $S$ is not null, since nullity would give, at $\varepsilon := 4^{-1}$, a cover of $S$ with all partial total lengths $\le 4^{-1} < 2^{-1}$, which claim 4 forbids. With steps 1.2, 2.2 and 3.1 all four claims are proved. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.2, step 3.1, step 3.2, L5, L10, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Nowhere dense and null are independent.** $S$ is nowhere dense and not null;
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is null and not nowhere dense ([[lem-countable-sets-are-null]],
  [[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]). The two false statements recording this are
  [[fs-nowhere-dense-implies-measure-zero]] and
  [[fs-measure-zero-implies-nowhere-dense]], with witnesses
  [[cex-nowhere-dense-with-positive-measure]] and
  [[cex-dense-set-of-measure-zero]].

- **Where the construction differs from the Cantor set, and where it does not.**
  Steps 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.2 and 3.1 use only that the pieces shrink to $0$ in
  length, double in number and stay separated, which the middle-thirds
  construction also satisfies; so $S$ and $C$ are indistinguishable at that level.
  The difference is entirely in step 2.1: the removed length at stage $n$ is
  $4^{-1}2^{-n}$ here and $2^{n}3^{-n-1}$ there, and only the first is summable to
  less than $1$. The removed lengths are added up in
  [[ex-fat-cantor-measure-computed]], where they total exactly $2^{-1}$.

- **Compactness is not what is used against nullity.** The proof of claim 4 never
  extracts a finite subcover: it combines the given countable cover of $S$ with
  the countably many removed pieces and appeals to
  [[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]], whose own proof is where the
  compactness of $[0,1]$ is spent. Passing through
  [[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]] would work too and would be longer.
