## Statement

$\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-equinumerous]]): the
plane of pairs of naturals is countably infinite ([[def-countable]]).

The bijection is exhibited, not merely asserted to exist. Define $2^m$ by
recursion on $m$ ([[thm-recursion]]) by $2^0 = 1$ and $2^{\sigma(m)} = 2^m + 2^m$,
and set

$$J(m,n) = 2^m \cdot \sigma(n + n), \qquad \text{that is} \qquad J(m,n) = 2^m(2n+1).$$

Then $J$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ onto
$\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, and $\sigma$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N}$ onto
$\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, so $\sigma^{-1} \circ J$ is a bijection
$\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$. What makes $J$ bijective is the
decomposition of a nonzero natural into a power of two times an odd number,
existence and uniqueness both.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Addition and multiplication on $\mathbb{N}$ with $m + 0 = m$, $m + \sigma(k) = \sigma(m + k)$, $m \cdot 0 = 0$ and $m \cdot \sigma(k) = m \cdot k + m$ ([[def-nat-addition]], [[def-nat-multiplication]]); $1 := \sigma(0)$. Call $k \in \mathbb{N}$ **even** if $k = j + j$ for some $j$ and **odd** if $k = \sigma(j + j)$ for some $j$.

[L1] Recursion: for a set $X$, $x_0 \in X$ and $F : X \to X$ there is $h : \mathbb{N} \to X$ with $h(0) = x_0$ and $h(\sigma(m)) = F(h(m))$ ([[thm-recursion]]).

[L2] Peano: $\sigma(k) \ne 0$ and $\sigma$ is injective ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]); every nonzero natural is a successor ([[lem-nat-nonzero-is-successor]]).

[L3] Arithmetic laws: $+$ and $\cdot$ are commutative and associative, $1 \cdot n = n = n \cdot 1$, $0 + n = n$, $a(b + c) = ab + ac$ and $\sigma(a) + n = \sigma(a + n)$ ([[lem-nat-add-commutative]], [[lem-nat-add-associative]], [[lem-nat-mult-commutative]], [[lem-nat-mult-associative]], [[lem-nat-mult-identity]], [[lem-nat-mult-distributive]], [[lem-nat-add-successor-left]]).

[L4] Order laws: exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds ([[lem-nat-trichotomy]]); $\le$ is reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive and total ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]), so $<$ is transitive, because $a < b < c$ gives $a \le c$ while $a = c$ would force $a = b$ by antisymmetry, and $<$ is irreflexive, because $a < a$ would demand $a \ne a$ ([[def-nat-order]]); $a \le b \iff a + k \le b + k$ and $a < b \iff a + k < b + k$ ([[lem-nat-order-add-compatible]]); $a < b \iff \sigma(a) \le b$, so $a < \sigma(a)$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]); $a \le b$ means $a + c = b$ for some $c$, and $a < b$ means $c \ne 0$ ([[def-nat-order]]).

[L5] Cancellation: $a \cdot k = b \cdot k$ with $k \ne 0$ gives $a = b$ ([[lem-nat-mult-cancellative]]); and $a \cdot b = 0$ forces $a = 0$ or $b = 0$ ([[lem-nat-no-zero-divisors]]).

[L6] Induction ([[thm-induction-principle]]) and strong induction ([[thm-strong-induction]]).

[L7] Bijections, injections, surjections, composition and inverses ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]); $A \approx B$ means a bijection $A \to B$ exists ([[def-equinumerous]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Apply [L1] with $X = \mathbb{N}$, $x_0 = 1$ and $F(x) = x + x$: this defines $m \mapsto 2^m$ with $2^0 = 1$ and $2^{\sigma(m)} = 2^m + 2^m$ for all $m$. [L1, construct]

1.2 Every natural is even or odd: by induction, $0 = 0 + 0$ is even; and if $k = j + j$ is even then $\sigma(k) = \sigma(j + j)$ is odd, while if $k = \sigma(j + j)$ is odd then $\sigma(k) = \sigma(\sigma(j+j)) = \sigma(\sigma(j) + j) = \sigma(j) + \sigma(j)$ is even, using $\sigma(j) + j = \sigma(j + j)$ and $x + \sigma(y) = \sigma(x + y)$. [L3, L6, given]

1.3 No natural is both even and odd, that is $j + j \ne \sigma(i + i)$ for all $i, j$: if $j \le i$ then $j + j \le i + j = j + i \le i + i < \sigma(i + i)$; if $i < j$ then $\sigma(i) \le j$, so $\sigma(i+i) < \sigma(\sigma(i+i)) = \sigma(\sigma(i) + i) = \sigma(i) + \sigma(i) \le j + j$; in both cases the two sides differ by irreflexivity of $<$. [L3, L4, given]

1.4 $\sigma$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N}$ onto $\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$: it is injective by [L2], its values are nonzero by [L2], and every nonzero natural is a value of $\sigma$ by [L2]. [L2, L7]

2.1 $2^m \ne 0$ for every $m$: by induction, $2^0 = \sigma(0) \ne 0$; and if $2^m \ne 0$ then $2^m = \sigma(a)$ for some $a$ by [L2], so $2^{\sigma(m)} = 2^m + 2^m = 2^m + \sigma(a) = \sigma(2^m + a) \ne 0$. [step 1.1, L2, L6, given]

2.2 $2^{m + d} = 2^m \cdot 2^d$ for all $m, d$: by induction on $d$, at $d = 0$ both sides are $2^m$ since $m + 0 = m$ and $2^m \cdot 1 = 2^m$; and if $2^{m+d} = 2^m \cdot 2^d$ then $2^{m + \sigma(d)} = 2^{\sigma(m+d)} = 2^{m+d} + 2^{m+d} = 2^m 2^d + 2^m 2^d = 2^m (2^d + 2^d) = 2^m \cdot 2^{\sigma(d)}$. [step 1.1, L3, L6, given]

3.1 Define $J : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ by $J(m,n) = 2^m \cdot \sigma(n+n)$. Its values are nonzero: $2^m \ne 0$ by step 2.1 and $\sigma(n+n) \ne 0$ by [L2], so $J(m,n) \ne 0$ by [L5]. Thus $J$ maps into $\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L2, L5, construct]

4.1 $J$ is injective. Suppose $2^m \sigma(n+n) = 2^{m'} \sigma(n'+n')$; by [L4] we may assume $m \le m'$, the other case being symmetric, and write $m' = m + d$. By step 2.2 the right side is $2^m (2^d \sigma(n'+n'))$, so cancelling the nonzero factor $2^m$ with [L5] and [L3] gives $\sigma(n+n) = 2^d \cdot \sigma(n'+n')$. If $d \ne 0$ then $d = \sigma(e)$ by [L2] and $2^d = 2^e + 2^e$, so the right side equals $w + w$ with $w = 2^e \sigma(n'+n')$, by [L3]; that would make $\sigma(n+n)$ both odd and even, contradicting step 1.3. Hence $d = 0$ and $m' = m$, and then $\sigma(n+n) = \sigma(n'+n')$ gives $n + n = n' + n'$ by injectivity of $\sigma$, whence $n = n'$ because $n < n'$ would force $n + n < n' + n = n + n' < n' + n'$ by [L4] and [L3], and symmetrically for $n' < n$. [step 1.3, step 2.2, step 3.1, L2, L3, L4, L5]

4.2 $J$ is surjective onto $\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$: by strong induction [L6] we show every $k$ is $0$ or a value of $J$. Let $k \ne 0$ and assume the claim for all $j < k$. By step 1.2, $k$ is odd or even. If $k = \sigma(j+j)$ then $k = 1 \cdot \sigma(j+j) = 2^0 \sigma(j+j) = J(0,j)$ by [L3]. If $k = j + j$ then $j \ne 0$, since $j = 0$ would give $k = 0$; also $j < j + j = k$ by [L4], because $j + j = k$ with $j \ne 0$; so the hypothesis at $j$ and $j \ne 0$ give $j = 2^m \sigma(n+n)$ for some $m, n$, and then $k = j + j = 2^m \sigma(n+n) + 2^m \sigma(n+n) = (2^m + 2^m) \sigma(n+n) = 2^{\sigma(m)} \sigma(n+n) = J(\sigma(m), n)$ by [L3] and step 1.1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 3.1, L3, L4, L6]

5.1 Therefore $J$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ onto $\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, and composing with the inverse of the bijection $\sigma$ of step 1.4 yields the bijection $\sigma^{-1} \circ J : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$; hence $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \approx \mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ is countably infinite. [step 1.4, step 4.1, step 4.2, L7] ∎

## Remarks

- Written out, $\sigma^{-1}(J(m,n)) = 2^m(2n+1) - 1$, the standard bijection. The detour through $\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$ avoids subtraction, which the naturals do not have as a total operation.

- The proof is a proof of unique factorisation into a power of two times an odd number: step 4.2 is existence and step 4.1 is uniqueness. Nothing weaker would do, and no appeal to a picture of the diagonal enumeration is made anywhere. Nothing here uses any choice principle.

- The Cantor pairing polynomial $(m,n) \mapsto \tfrac{(m+n)(m+n+1)}{2} + n$ is an alternative bijection. It is not used because halving is not available in $\mathbb{N}$ without first developing division with remainder, whereas doubling, which is all $2^m$ needs, is immediate from addition.
