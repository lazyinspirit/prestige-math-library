## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]).

- $X$ is **regular** when a point can be separated from a closed set not
  containing it: for every closed $C \subseteq X$ and every
  $x \in X \setminus C$ there are $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$ with
  $$x \in U, \qquad C \subseteq V, \qquad U \cap V = \varnothing .$$
- $X$ is **$T_3$** when it is regular **and** $T_1$ ([[def-t0-and-t1-spaces]]).

Since an open set containing a point is an open neighbourhood of it
([[def-neighbourhood-top]]), regularity reads: $x$ and $C$ have disjoint open
neighbourhoods. The case $C = \varnothing$ is allowed and is satisfied by
$U = X$, $V = \varnothing$, so no nonemptiness is hidden in the condition.

**The convention fork, and this library's side of it.** Textbooks disagree about
whether the word *regular* carries a $T_1$ hypothesis. Munkres builds it in,
defining a regular space to be one in which points are closed and the separation
condition above holds; Kelley, Willard and Engelking do not, and reserve $T_3$
for the conjunction. **This library takes the second side**: *regular* names the
separation condition alone, $T_3$ names regular plus $T_1$, and every statement
that needs points to be closed writes the $T_1$ hypothesis out. The reason is
that the two halves are genuinely independent and each is used alone below: the
indiscrete topology on a two-point set is regular and not $T_0$
([[def-standard-topologies]]), and the cofinite topology on an infinite set is
$T_1$ and not regular, both witnessed on the companion page.

**Regularity alone implies no other separation axiom.** It does not imply $T_0$,
$T_1$ or Hausdorff ([[def-hausdorff-space]]): in the indiscrete topology on a set
$X$ the only closed sets are $\varnothing$ and $X$, so the only pair $(C, x)$ to
be separated has $C = \varnothing$, and $U = X$, $V = \varnothing$ separates it;
yet no two distinct points are distinguished by any open set. Conversely $T_1$
does not imply regularity. It is the *conjunction* $T_3$ that sits above
Hausdorff in the hierarchy, and the proof of that is two items below.

## Remarks

- **A regular space is not required to separate two closed sets**, which is the
  stronger condition of normality defined later on this page; and a normal space
  is not required to separate a point from a closed set, since a point need not
  be closed. Neither axiom implies the other without $T_1$, and the two false
  statements of this page make that precise.

- **What regularity is really about.** The reformulation proved next — every
  point has a neighbourhood base of closed neighbourhoods — is the form in which
  regularity is used in practice, and the form in which it is verified for the
  ordinal spaces later on this page, whose basis consists of clopen sets.

- **The numeral.** Because of the fork above, "$T_3$" in the literature may mean
  either what is defined here or the bare separation condition. This library
  always writes the numeral for the conjunction and never uses it to abbreviate
  the separation condition alone ([[rem-separation-axiom-conventions]]).
