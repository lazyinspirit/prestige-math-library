## Definition

For $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, define the **order** by

$$m \le n \iff \exists k \in \mathbb{N}\ (m + k = n),$$

and the **strict order** by $m < n \iff (m \le n \text{ and } m \neq n)$, using
addition ([[def-nat-addition]]).

## Remarks

Read $m \le n$ as "$n$ is $m$ plus something": the gap $k$ with $m + k = n$ is
unique when it exists (by cancellation, [[lem-nat-add-cancellative]]) and is
written $n - m$ once subtraction is available. That $\le$ is genuinely a linear
order, reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive, and total, is proved in
[[thm-nat-linear-order]] and [[lem-nat-trichotomy]]; compatibility with the
arithmetic ([[lem-nat-order-add-compatible]],
[[lem-nat-order-mult-compatible]]) and discreteness
($m < n \iff \sigma(m) \le n$, [[lem-nat-discrete]]) follow.

In the von Neumann model this order coincides with membership and inclusion:
$m \le n \iff m \subseteq n$ and $m < n \iff m \in n$, matching the picture of
each natural number as the set $\{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ of its predecessors
([[def-natural-numbers]]). The least-element property of every nonempty subset,
the **well-ordering principle** ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]), is the deepest
consequence.
