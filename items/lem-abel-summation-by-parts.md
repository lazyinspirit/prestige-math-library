## Statement

Let $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ be sequences of reals and let

$$A_n \;:=\; \sum_{k<n} a_k \qquad (n \in \mathbb{N})$$

be the partial sums of $\sum a_k$ ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]]), so that
$A_0 = 0$ and $a_k = A_{k+1} - A_k$ for every $k$. Then for every natural number
$n \ge 1$

$$\sum_{k<n} a_k b_k \;=\; A_n\, b_{n-1} \;-\; \sum_{k<n-1} A_{k+1}\,(b_{k+1} - b_k) .$$

Both sides are finite sums in the sense of [[def-finite-sum]]; at $n = 1$ the
right-hand sum is empty and the identity reads $a_0 b_0 = A_1 b_0$.

**The hypothesis $n \ge 1$ is what makes the statement legitimate**, not merely
convenient: the index $n-1$ occurs on the right, and $n-1$ is a natural number
exactly when $n \ge 1$. At $n = 0$ there is nothing to state, both the left-hand
side and $A_0$ being $0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ of reals and the partial sums $A_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ ([[def-series]]).

[L1] Finite sums are defined by the recursion $\sum_{k<0} x_k = 0$ and $\sum_{k<n+1} x_k = \sum_{k<n} x_k + x_n$ ([[def-finite-sum]]).

[L2] The partial sums satisfy $A_0 = 0$ and $A_{n+1} = A_n + a_n$ for every $n$, those being the two clauses of [L1] applied to $(a_k)$ ([[def-series]]).

[L3] Finite sums are additive and may be split at any intermediate index ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L4] The principle of induction on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 The claim to be proved by induction is the statement $P(m)$: the displayed identity holds at $n = m+1$, that is $\sum_{k<m+1} a_k b_k = A_{m+1} b_m - \sum_{k<m} A_{k+1}(b_{k+1} - b_k)$. Every $n \ge 1$ is $m+1$ for exactly one $m \in \mathbb{N}$, so proving $P(m)$ for all $m$ proves the lemma. [L4]

1.2 $P(0)$ holds: the left-hand side is $\sum_{k<1} a_k b_k = a_0 b_0$ by [L1], while $A_1 = A_0 + a_0 = a_0$ by [L2] and $\sum_{k<0} A_{k+1}(b_{k+1}-b_k) = 0$ by [L1], so the right-hand side is $a_0 b_0 - 0$. [L1, L2, base]

1.3 Assume $P(m)$ for a fixed $m \in \mathbb{N}$. [ih]

1.4 By [L1], $\sum_{k<m+2} a_k b_k = \sum_{k<m+1} a_k b_k + a_{m+1} b_{m+1}$. [L1]

1.5 By [L1], $\sum_{k<m+1} A_{k+1}(b_{k+1} - b_k) = \sum_{k<m} A_{k+1}(b_{k+1} - b_k) + A_{m+1}(b_{m+1} - b_m)$. [L1, L3]

1.6 By [L2], $A_{m+2} = A_{m+1} + a_{m+1}$, so $a_{m+1} = A_{m+2} - A_{m+1}$. [L2]

2.1 Substituting the induction hypothesis into step 1.4 gives $\sum_{k<m+2} a_k b_k = A_{m+1} b_m - \sum_{k<m} A_{k+1}(b_{k+1}-b_k) + a_{m+1} b_{m+1}$. [step 1.3, step 1.4]

2.2 Using step 1.6, $A_{m+1} b_m + a_{m+1} b_{m+1} = A_{m+1} b_m + A_{m+2} b_{m+1} - A_{m+1} b_{m+1} = A_{m+2} b_{m+1} - A_{m+1}(b_{m+1} - b_m)$. [step 1.6, algebra]

3.1 Combining step 2.1 and step 2.2 and then step 1.5 gives $\sum_{k<m+2} a_k b_k = A_{m+2} b_{m+1} - A_{m+1}(b_{m+1}-b_m) - \sum_{k<m} A_{k+1}(b_{k+1}-b_k) = A_{m+2} b_{m+1} - \sum_{k<m+1} A_{k+1}(b_{k+1}-b_k)$, which is $P(m+1)$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 1.5, algebra]

4.1 By [L4] applied to step 1.2 and step 3.1, $P(m)$ holds for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$, that is, the displayed identity holds for every $n \ge 1$. [step 1.2, step 3.1, L4, discharge-induction] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the identity is for.** It converts a series $\sum a_k b_k$, about which nothing is assumed, into a boundary term $A_n b_{n-1}$ and a series $\sum A_{k+1}(b_{k+1} - b_k)$ whose terms carry the *differences* of $(b_k)$. If $(A_n)$ is bounded and $(b_k)$ is monotone, those differences have one sign and telescope, which is exactly the situation of [[thm-dirichlet-test]]. The transformation is the discrete analogue of integration by parts, and the boundary term is the analogue of the boundary term there.

- **The block form needs no separate proof.** For $1 \le M \le n$, subtracting the identity at $M$ from the identity at $n$ gives $\sum_{k=M}^{n-1} a_k b_k = A_n b_{n-1} - A_M b_{M-1} - \sum_{k=M-1}^{n-2} A_{k+1}(b_{k+1}-b_k)$, using only splitting of finite sums ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]). Nothing on this page needs that form, so it is recorded here rather than stated as a result.

- **Two conventions are doing work.** $A_n$ sums the $n$ terms $a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$, so $A_0 = 0$ and $a_k = A_{k+1} - A_k$ with no shift ([[def-series]]); and the empty sum is $0$ ([[def-finite-sum]]), which is what makes $n = 1$ a genuine instance of the identity rather than a case to be excluded.
