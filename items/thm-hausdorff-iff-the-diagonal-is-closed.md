## Statement

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space and give $X \times X$ the product
topology ([[def-product-topology]]). Then $X$ is Hausdorff
([[def-hausdorff-space]]) if and only if the diagonal $\Delta_X$
([[def-the-diagonal-of-a-space]]) is closed in $X \times X$:

$$X \text{ Hausdorff} \iff \Delta_X = \overline{\Delta_X} \text{ in } X \times X .$$

The condition on the right is a single closedness statement about one subset of
one space, with no quantifier over pairs of points visible in it; that is what
makes the criterion useful, and every consequence on this page is obtained by
pulling $\Delta_X$ back along a continuous map.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A topological space $(X,\mathcal{T})$, the product $X \times X$ with the product topology, and the diagonal $\Delta_X = \{\, z \in X \times X : z_0 = z_1 \,\}$.

[A1] $X$ is Hausdorff when for all $x \ne y$ in $X$ there are open $U \ni x$ and $V \ni y$ with $U \cap V = \varnothing$ ([[def-hausdorff-space]]).

[A2] The boxes $U \times V$ with $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$ form a basis for the product topology on $X \times X$, the index set being $2$ ([[def-product-topology]], [[def-topology-basis-subbasis]], [[def-the-diagonal-of-a-space]]).

[L1] For a basis $\mathcal{B}$ of a space, a point lies in $\overline{A}$ if and only if every $B \in \mathcal{B}$ containing it meets $A$; and $A$ is closed if and only if $A = \overline{A}$ ([[thm-closure-characterisation-top]], claims 1(d) and 2, [[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

[L2] $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ for every subset $A$ of a space ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]], [[def-topological-space]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $X$ is Hausdorff and let $z \in X \times X$ with $z \notin \Delta_X$, so that $z_0 \ne z_1$; by [A1] there are open $U \ni z_0$ and $V \ni z_1$ with $U \cap V = \varnothing$. [A1]

1.2 Assume $\Delta_X$ is closed and let $x, y \in X$ with $x \ne y$; then $z := (x,y)$ satisfies $z \notin \Delta_X = \overline{\Delta_X}$, the equality holding by [L1] since $\Delta_X$ is closed. [L1]

2.1 The box $U \times V$ of step 1.1 is a basic open set containing $z$, and $(U \times V) \cap \Delta_X = \varnothing$: a point $w$ of the intersection would satisfy $w_0 = w_1$ with $w_0 \in U$ and $w_1 \in V$, putting $w_0$ in $U \cap V = \varnothing$. [step 1.1, A2]

2.2 By [L1] applied to the basis of [A2], step 1.2 supplies a basic open box $U \times V$ with $z \in U \times V$ and $(U \times V) \cap \Delta_X = \varnothing$; so $x \in U$ and $y \in V$. [step 1.2, A2, L1]

3.1 From step 2.1 and [L1], $z \notin \overline{\Delta_X}$ for every $z \notin \Delta_X$; hence $\overline{\Delta_X} \subseteq \Delta_X$, and with [L2] this gives $\overline{\Delta_X} = \Delta_X$, so $\Delta_X$ is closed. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L1, L2]

3.2 The sets $U$ and $V$ of step 2.2 are disjoint: if $t \in U \cap V$ then $(t,t)$ lies in $U \times V$ and in $\Delta_X$, contradicting $(U \times V) \cap \Delta_X = \varnothing$. [step 2.2]

4.1 Step 3.1 shows that $X$ Hausdorff implies $\Delta_X$ closed, and steps 2.2 and 3.2 show that $\Delta_X$ closed implies that any two distinct points of $X$ have disjoint open neighbourhoods, which by [A1] is the Hausdorff condition; the two implications are the theorem. [step 2.2, step 3.1, step 3.2, A1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The criterion is about the product topology on a binary product**, and there the box basis and the product basis are the same family ([[def-product-topology]]), so the boxes tested in steps 2.1 and 2.2 are legitimately basic. No infinite product is formed anywhere in the argument, and the criterion says nothing about one.

- **Neither direction spends a choice principle.** The forward direction produces one box from one Hausdorff separation of one named pair, and the backward direction reads one box out of the closure characterisation; there is no family to select from in either.

- **What the criterion does not say.** It does not say that $\Delta_X$ is closed in $X \times X$ carrying some other topology, and it does not say that $\Delta_X$ is closed in $X$ — the latter is not even a statement, $\Delta_X$ being a subset of the square. The hypothesis that $X \times X$ carries the product topology is used at [A2] and cannot be dropped.
