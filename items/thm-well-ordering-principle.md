## Statement

Every nonempty subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ has a least element: there is $\ell \in S$ with $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A nonempty subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. Define $T = \{\, n \in \mathbb{N} : \text{every } m \text{ with } m \le n \text{ satisfies } m \notin S \,\}$ (informally, no element of $S$ is $\le n$).

[L1] Induction principle: a subset of $\mathbb{N}$ that contains $0$ and is closed under $\sigma$ equals $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L2] $m < \sigma(n) \iff m \le n$, and $\sigma(n)$ is the immediate successor of $n$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]).

[L3] For any $s, n$ either $s \le n$ or $n < s$, and $n < s \iff \sigma(n) \le s$ (comparability and discreteness) ([[lem-nat-trichotomy]], [[lem-nat-discrete]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose $S$ is nonempty but has no least element. [assume-contra]

2.1 First, $0 \in T$: if $0 \in S$ then $0 \le s$ for all $s \in S$ (since $0 + s = s$), making $0$ a least element, contrary to the assumption; hence $0 \notin S$, and $m \le 0$ forces $m = 0$, so every $m \le 0$ lies outside $S$. [step 1.1, given]

2.2 Next, $T$ is closed under $\sigma$: assume $n \in T$; if $\sigma(n) \in S$ then no $s \in S$ satisfies $s < \sigma(n)$ (else $s \le n$ by [L2], so $s \notin S$ because $n \in T$, a contradiction), hence $\sigma(n) \le s$ for all $s \in S$ by [L3], making $\sigma(n)$ a least element, contrary to the assumption; therefore $\sigma(n) \notin S$, and any $m$ with $m \le \sigma(n)$ satisfies $m = \sigma(n)$ or $m \ne \sigma(n)$; in the second case $m \le \sigma(n)$ together with $m \ne \sigma(n)$ gives $m < \sigma(n)$ by the definition of the strict order, hence $m \le n$ by [L2] and $m \notin S$ because $n \in T$, while in the first case $m = \sigma(n) \notin S$; so every $m \le \sigma(n)$ lies outside $S$, giving $\sigma(n) \in T$. [step 1.1, L2, L3]

3.1 By the induction principle [L1], from $0 \in T$ and closure under $\sigma$, $T = \mathbb{N}$; then for every $n$, taking $m = n \le n$ shows $n \notin S$, so $S = \varnothing$, contradicting nonemptiness; therefore $S$ has a least element. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L1, discharge-contradiction] ∎
