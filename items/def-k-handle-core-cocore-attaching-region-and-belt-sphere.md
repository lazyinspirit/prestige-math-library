## Definition

For integers $0\le k\le n$, the standard $n$-dimensional $k$-handle is $D^k\times D^{n-k}$. Its core is $D^k\times\{0\}$, its cocore is $\{0\}\times D^{n-k}$, its attaching region is $S^{k-1}\times D^{n-k}$, and its attaching sphere is $S^{k-1}\times\{0\}$. The outgoing region is $D^k\times S^{n-k-1}$ and the belt sphere is $\{0\}\times S^{n-k-1}$. Here $D^j$ is the closed unit disk, $D^0$ is a point, and $S^{-1}=\varnothing$. For $n=0$ both boundary regions are empty.
