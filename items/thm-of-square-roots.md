## Statement

Let $F$ be a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]). Then every
$a \in F$ with $a \ge 0$ has a **unique** $s \in F$ with $s \ge 0$ and $s^2 = a$;
we write $s = \sqrt{a}$. Consequently the positive elements of $F$ are exactly the
nonzero squares: $x > 0$ if and only if $x = y^2$ for some $y \neq 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), that is, an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with the least-upper-bound property, and an element $a \in F$ with $a \ge 0$.

[L1] Every nonempty subset of $F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Sign and scaling rules: a product of positives is positive, and for $c > 0$ one has $x < y \iff cx < cy$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

[L3] Squaring is strictly monotone on the nonnegatives: if $0 \le x < y$ then $x^2 < y^2$; in particular squaring is injective on $\{x : x \ge 0\}$ ([[lem-of-square-monotone]]).

[L4] A nonzero square is positive: if $y \neq 0$ then $y^2 > 0$ ([[lem-of-square-positive]]).

[L5] Multiplying inequalities of positives: if $0 < x < y$ and $0 < u < v$ then $xu < yv$ ([[prop-of-multiply-inequalities]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 If $a = 0$, then $s = 0$ satisfies $s \ge 0$ and $s^2 = 0 = a$, so existence holds; assume henceforth $a > 0$. [given, algebra]

1.2 Uniqueness holds once a root exists: if $u, v \ge 0$ satisfy $u^2 = v^2$, then strict monotonicity of squaring on nonnegatives [L3] rules out both $u < v$ and $u > v$, forcing $u = v$; so at most one $s \ge 0$ has $s^2 = a$. [L3, given]

1.3 Define $S = \{ t \in F : t \ge 0 \text{ and } t^2 \le a \}$; then $0 \in S$ because $0 \ge 0$ and $0^2 = 0 \le a$, so $S \neq \emptyset$. [given, algebra]

1.4 The element $1 + a$ is an upper bound of $S$: since $a > 0$ we have $1 + a > 1$, so any $t > 1 + a$ has $t > 1$ and $t > 0$, whence $t^2 = t \cdot t > 1 \cdot t = t > 1 + a > a$, giving $t \notin S$. [given, L2]

2.1 By completeness [L1], $s := \sup S$ exists in $F$; and since $0 \in S$ we have $s \ge 0$. [L1, step 1.3, step 1.4]

3.1 Assume, for contradiction, that $s^2 \neq a$; by trichotomy either $s^2 < a$ or $s^2 > a$. [assume-contra, step 2.1]

4.1 (Case $s^2 < a$.) Choose $h$ with $0 < h < 1$ and $h < \dfrac{a - s^2}{2s + 1}$, possible since $a - s^2 > 0$ and $2s + 1 \ge 1 > 0$; then $h^2 = h \cdot h < h \cdot 1 = h$ and $h(2s+1) < a - s^2$, so $(s+h)^2 = s^2 + 2sh + h^2 < s^2 + 2sh + h = s^2 + h(2s+1) < a$, whence $s + h \in S$ with $s + h > s$, contradicting that $s$ is an upper bound of $S$. [assume-case low, step 3.1, step 2.1, L2, L5, choose]

4.2 (Case $s^2 > a$.) Here $s > 0$ since $s^2 > a \ge 0$; choose $h$ with $0 < h < s$ and $h < \dfrac{s^2 - a}{2s}$, so $2sh < s^2 - a$ and $(s-h)^2 = s^2 - 2sh + h^2 \ge s^2 - 2sh > a$, hence every $t \in S$ has $t^2 \le a < (s-h)^2$ with $t \ge 0$ and $s - h > 0$, so $t < s - h$ by [L3]; thus $s - h$ is an upper bound of $S$ with $s - h < s$, contradicting that $s$ is the least upper bound. [assume-case high, step 3.1, step 2.1, L3, choose]

5.1 Both cases of the disjunction in step 3.1 give a contradiction, so the assumption fails and $s^2 = a$: a unique (by step 1.2) $s = \sqrt{a} \ge 0$ with $s^2 = a$ exists, and applying this to any $x > 0$ writes $x = (\sqrt{x})^2$ with $\sqrt{x} \neq 0$ while conversely any nonzero square is positive by [L4], so the positive elements of $F$ are exactly the nonzero squares. [step 4.1, step 4.2, step 3.1, step 1.2, L4, cases, discharge-contradiction] ∎
