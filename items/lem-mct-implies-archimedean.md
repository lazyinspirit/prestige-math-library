## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field with the monotone convergence property (MCT) of
[[def-completeness-properties]]. Then $F$ is Archimedean
([[def-archimedean-field]]).

So (MCT), like (BW) and like (LUB), carries the Archimedean property on its own,
and the hypothesis attached to (CC) in
[[lem-cauchy-complete-and-archimedean-imply-mct]] need not be attached here.
This is what lets [[rem-where-the-archimedean-hypothesis-is-needed]] sort the
five properties into those that do and those that do not.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with (MCT).

[L1] The property (MCT): every nondecreasing sequence in $F$ that is bounded above converges in $F$ ([[def-completeness-properties]]).

[L2] Sequences in an ordered field: a sequence is a function $\mathbb{N} \to F$; it is nondecreasing when $x_j \le x_k$ for all $j \le k$; convergence and Cauchyness in $F$ are as fixed there ([[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Archimedean property: $F$ is Archimedean when for every $x \in F$ there is a natural $n$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$, where $0 \cdot 1_F = 0$ and $(n+1)\cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ ([[def-archimedean-field]]).

[L4] Canonical naturals: $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ and $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing on $\{1,2,3,\dots\}$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L5] A sequence converging in $F$ is Cauchy in $F$ (clause 3 of [[lem-of-sequence-basics]]).

[L6] Order arithmetic: $0 < 1_F$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]); the order is total, so the failure of $x < y$ is $y \le x$; adding a constant preserves the order ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[def-ordered-field]]); and $|u| = u$ whenever $u \ge 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]). Here [[lem-of-add-order]] states the STRICT forms and only those; the nonstrict forms used below are those together with the equality cases, which trichotomy settles, the order being total ([[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose $F$ has (MCT) and is not Archimedean; then there is $x \in F$ with $n \cdot 1_F \le x$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. [L3, L6, assume-contra]

1.2 Let $(y_k)$ be the sequence $y_k := k \cdot 1_F$ in $F$, so $y_0 = 0$ and $y_{k+1} = y_k + 1_F$; it is nondecreasing, since $0 = y_0 < y_n$ for $n \ge 1$ and $j \mapsto j \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing on the positive naturals. [L2, L3, L4]

2.1 $(y_k)$ is bounded above by $x$, so (MCT) makes it converge in $F$ to some $L$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1, L2]

3.1 Being convergent, $(y_k)$ is Cauchy in $F$, so, $1_F$ being positive, there is $N \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|y_k - y_l| < 1_F$ for all $k, l \ge N$. [step 2.1, L2, L5, L6]

4.1 But $y_{N+1} - y_N = 1_F > 0$, so $|y_{N+1} - y_N| = 1_F$, which is not $< 1_F$; this contradicts step 3.1. [step 1.2, step 3.1, L6]

5.1 The assumption of step 1.1 is therefore untenable, and an ordered field with (MCT) is Archimedean. [step 4.1, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why this item exists.** Without it, the natural reading of the equivalence
  theorem would attach an Archimedean hypothesis to (MCT) as well, and
  [[rem-where-the-archimedean-hypothesis-is-needed]] would answer its own
  question wrongly. With it the answer is clean: (LUB), (BW) and (MCT) each
  imply the Archimedean property, while (NIP) and (CC) do not
  ([[fs-nested-intervals-implies-lub]], [[fs-cauchy-complete-implies-lub]]).

- **The witness is the same sequence as in [[lem-bw-implies-archimedean]]**, the
  canonical naturals, but the two arguments use different failures of it. There
  the sequence is bounded and has no convergent subsequence; here it is
  nondecreasing and bounded above and has no limit. Neither argument implies the
  other, because neither (BW) nor (MCT) is assumed in the other's proof.

- The gap of exactly $1_F$ between consecutive terms is what does the work, and
  it is available in every ordered field: $1_F > 0$ by
  [[cor-of-one-positive]], and no smallness of $1_F$ relative to $x$ is
  possible, since the Cauchy condition is tested at the threshold $1_F$ itself.
