## Definition

For a real $m\times m$ matrix $H$, write $q_H(h):=\langle Hh,h\rangle$ using [[def-euclidean-inner-product]]. It is **positive definite** when $q_H(h)>0$ for every $h\ne0$, **negative definite** when $q_H(h)<0$ for every $h\ne0$, **positive semidefinite** when $q_H(h)\ge0$ for every $h$, **negative semidefinite** when $q_H(h)\le0$ for every $h$, and **indefinite** when it takes both positive and negative values. For a twice differentiable scalar field, its Hessian matrix is the matrix of [[def-hessian-and-euclidean-critical-point]].
