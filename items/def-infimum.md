## Definition

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $\ell \in \mathbb{R}$. Then $\ell$ is a
**greatest lower bound**, or **infimum**, of $S$ if both of the following hold:

- $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$ ([[def-bounded-set]]), that is, $\ell \le s$ for
  every $s \in S$;
- $\ell' \le \ell$ for every lower bound $\ell'$ of $S$.

Written out in one line:

$$\ell \text{ is an infimum of } S \iff \big[(\forall s \in S)\, \ell \le s\big] \text{ and } \big[(\forall \ell' \in \mathbb{R})\, \big((\forall s \in S)\, \ell' \le s\big) \Rightarrow \ell' \le \ell\big].$$

An infimum, when it exists, is unique ([[lem-sup-unique]]), so we may write
$\inf S$ for it.

## Remarks

- This is the exact dual of the least upper bound (supremum) of
  [[def-complete-ordered-field]]: reverse every inequality and swap "least" for
  "greatest". The two notions are related by reflection through $0$
  ([[lem-reflection]]).
- Existence is deliberately *not* part of the definition. That every nonempty
  subset of $\mathbb{R}$ which is bounded below actually has an infimum is a
  theorem, [[thm-infimum-property]], derived from the least-upper-bound property;
  it is not an axiom and it is not free.
- As with a supremum, an infimum need not belong to $S$; when it does, it is the
  minimum of $S$ ([[def-max-min]]).
- The usable form of the definition in later arguments is the epsilon
  characterisation [[lem-inf-epsilon]]: $\ell = \inf S$ exactly when $\ell$ is a
  lower bound that cannot be raised by any positive amount without losing that
  property.
