## Definition

Let $\gamma$ be an ordinal ([[def-ordinal]]). Since $\gamma$ is the set of
ordinals below it and $\xi < \eta$ means $\xi \in \eta$, the following two
families of subsets of $\gamma$ are defined for $\beta \in \gamma$ and
$\alpha \in \gamma$:

$$[0,\beta] \;:=\; \{\, \xi \in \gamma : \xi \le \beta \,\} \;=\; \beta^{+}, \qquad (\alpha,\beta] \;:=\; \{\, \xi \in \gamma : \alpha < \xi \le \beta \,\} \;=\; \beta^{+} \setminus \alpha^{+} .$$

Both identifications are immediate: $\beta^{+} = \beta \cup \{\beta\}$ is the set
of ordinals $\le \beta$, and it is a subset of $\gamma$ because $\gamma$ is
transitive and $\beta \in \gamma$ ([[def-ordinal]], [[lem-ordinal-basics]]).

Put

$$\mathcal{B}_\gamma \;:=\; \{\, [0,\beta] : \beta \in \gamma \,\} \;\cup\; \{\, (\alpha,\beta] : \alpha, \beta \in \gamma,\ \alpha < \beta \,\} .$$

**$\mathcal{B}_\gamma$ is a basis for a unique topology on $\gamma$**
([[thm-basis-criterion]], [[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]), and that topology is
the **order topology on $\gamma$**. The obligation is discharged here.

*(B1), covering.* If $\xi \in \gamma$ then $\xi \in [0,\xi] \in \mathcal{B}_\gamma$,
so $\bigcup \mathcal{B}_\gamma = \gamma$. For $\gamma = 0 = \varnothing$ the
family is empty and $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing = \gamma$, so (B1) holds
there too.

*(B2), intersections.* By trichotomy of the ordinals ([[lem-ordinal-trichotomy]])
any two ordinals have a maximum and a minimum, namely the larger and the smaller
of the two, and for $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \beta_1, \beta_2 \in \gamma$:

- $[0,\beta_1] \cap [0,\beta_2] = [0, \min\{\beta_1,\beta_2\}]$;
- $[0,\beta_1] \cap (\alpha_2,\beta_2] = (\alpha_2, \min\{\beta_1,\beta_2\}]$ when
  $\alpha_2 < \min\{\beta_1,\beta_2\}$, and $\varnothing$ otherwise;
- $(\alpha_1,\beta_1] \cap (\alpha_2,\beta_2] = (\max\{\alpha_1,\alpha_2\},\ \min\{\beta_1,\beta_2\}]$
  when $\max\{\alpha_1,\alpha_2\} < \min\{\beta_1,\beta_2\}$, and $\varnothing$
  otherwise.

In each case the intersection is either a member of $\mathcal{B}_\gamma$ or
empty, and in the empty case (B2) is vacuous, having no point to test. So (B2)
holds, and [[thm-basis-criterion]] supplies the topology and its uniqueness.

**This definition is for ordinals only, and it says so.** The general order
topology of a linearly ordered set takes the open intervals, together with the
initial and final rays, as a basis. For an ordinal that family is the wrong one:
a successor $\beta^{+}$ has an immediate predecessor, so the smallest open
interval around it is already $\{\beta^{+}\}$, but no *interval* of the form
$(\alpha,\eta)$ isolates $0$, and the initial segments must be supplied
separately. The family $\mathcal{B}_\gamma$ above is exactly the general order
basis for an ordinal, rewritten so that no case analysis is needed; nothing here
claims to define the order topology of an arbitrary linearly ordered set, and no
statement on this page is about such a set.

**Isolated and non-isolated points.** Every ordinal is $0$, a successor, or a
limit ([[def-limit-ordinal]]). If $\xi = 0$ then $\{\xi\} = [0,0]$ is basic open;
if $\xi = \alpha^{+}$ then $\{\xi\} = (\alpha, \xi]$ is basic open; so every
non-limit point of $\gamma$ is isolated. If $\xi$ is a limit ordinal then every
basic set containing $\xi$ contains some $(\alpha,\xi]$ with $\alpha < \xi$, and
$\alpha^{+} < \xi$ because $\xi$ is a limit, so $\alpha^{+}$ is a second point of
that basic set; hence a limit point of $\gamma$ is not isolated. In particular
$\omega$, the least limit ordinal ([[lem-omega-least-limit-ordinal]]), is the
unique non-isolated point of $\omega + 1$, and every ordinal $\gamma \le \omega$
carries the discrete topology ([[def-standard-topologies]]).

## Remarks

- **The basis members are clopen**, and that is proved as the next item; it is
  the single fact that makes ordinal spaces easy to place in the separation
  hierarchy, since a clopen basis gives regularity at once.

- **$\gamma$ is a set of ordinals and also a space.** The notations $[0,\beta]$
  and $(\alpha,\beta]$ are relative to the ambient $\gamma$: the same symbols in
  a larger ordinal denote larger sets. Where two ordinals are in play the ambient
  one is named.

- **Nothing here needs any choice principle.** Every fact used above is a theorem
  of ZF ([[lem-ordinal-basics]], [[lem-ordinal-trichotomy]]).
