## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]) and let $I \in \mathbb{R}$. The following are equivalent.

1. **(Darboux)** $f$ is Darboux integrable on $[a,b]$ with
   $\int_a^b f = I$ ([[def-darboux-integral]]).
2. **(Riemann)** For every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$
   such that
   $$\bigl|\,S(f,P,\xi) - I\,\bigr| \;<\; \varepsilon$$
   for **every** tagged partition $(P,\xi)$ of $[a,b]$ with $\|P\| < \delta$
   ([[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

**The quantifier over tagged partitions is universal, and that is the content.**
Condition 2 constrains every tagged partition of small mesh at once, tags
included; it is not a statement about one sequence of tagged partitions, and it
cannot be weakened to one. The companion page of this pair exhibits a
non-integrable function whose Riemann sums are constant along such a sequence.

**Boundedness is a hypothesis of both conditions as stated here.** Condition 1
presupposes it, since the Darboux sums of an unbounded function do not exist
([[def-darboux-sums]]); condition 2 makes sense for unbounded $f$ as well, and
in fact implies boundedness, but that implication is not proved here and is not
used: every application on this page starts from a bounded $f$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, a bounded $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $M \ge 0$ with $|f(x)| \le M$ for every $x \in [a,b]$, and a real $I$. Put $M_{+} := M + 1$, so $M_{+} > 0$ and $|f(x)| \le M_{+}$ for every $x$.

[L1] For a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[a,b]$: $n \ge 1$, the subintervals $I_i = [t_i,t_{i+1}]$ are nonempty, $\Delta_i = t_{i+1} - t_i > 0$, $\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = b-a$, and $\|P\| = \max\{\Delta_i : i < n\}$. The uniform partition $U_N$ into $N \ge 1$ parts has $\|U_N\| = (b-a)/\iota(N)$. The common refinement $P \vee P_0$ refines both, and $n_{P \vee P_0} \le n_P + n_{P_0} - 1$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-interval]]).

[L2] $L(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}m_i\Delta_i$ and $U(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}M_i\Delta_i$ with $m_i = \inf f[I_i]$ and $M_i = \sup f[I_i]$; $L(f,P) \le \underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,P)$; $f$ is integrable exactly when the two integrals coincide, and then $\int_a^b f$ is their common value ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L3] $S(f,P,\xi) = \sum_{i<n}f(\xi_i)\Delta_i$ for a tagging $\xi$ of $P$, and $L(f,P) \le S(f,P,\xi) \le U(f,P)$ when $f$ is bounded ([[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]]).

[L4] Riemann's criterion: a bounded $f$ is integrable if and only if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a partition $P$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$ ([[thm-riemann-criterion]]).

[L5] If $P'$ refines $P$ then $L(f,P) \le L(f,P')$, $U(f,P') \le U(f,P)$, and moreover $U(f,P) - U(f,P') \le 2M_{+}\,\iota(n'-n)\,\|P\|$ and $L(f,P') - L(f,P) \le 2M_{+}\,\iota(n'-n)\,\|P\|$ ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]]).

[L6] $\varepsilon$-characterisations: if $u = \sup S$ with $S$ nonempty then for every real $\eta > 0$ there is $s \in S$ with $s > u - \eta$; dually for the infimum ([[lem-sup-epsilon]], [[lem-inf-epsilon]]).

[L7] A family of nonempty sets **indexed by a natural number** $n$ has a choice function, and this is a theorem of ZF; the family used below is indexed by $i < n$, which is exactly that listed form. [[lem-finite-choice]] states it in that form and expressly declines to identify it with "every finite family of nonempty sets has a choice function", no definition of finiteness being available where it is proved ([[lem-finite-choice]], [[def-choice-function]]).

[L8] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N) < \eta$; $\iota$ is nonnegative, additive and nondecreasing on $\mathbb{N}$, and $\iota(N) > 0$ for $N \ge 1$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L9] Finite sums: additivity, scaling, monotonicity in the terms ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L10] Ordered-field arithmetic and the absolute value: adding a constant and multiplying by a positive quantity preserve an inequality; the order is total and transitive; $|x| < c$ exactly when $-c < x < c$ for $c > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[cor-of-one-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Condition 2 implies condition 1.** Assume condition 2 and let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. Fix $\delta > 0$ as in condition 2 for this $\varepsilon$, and put $\theta := \varepsilon/(b-a) > 0$ by [L10]. [given, L10, choose]

1.2 **Condition 1 implies condition 2; this half of the proof is steps 1.2, 2.2, 2.3, 3.3, 4.2, 5.2 and 6.2, and its symbols are its own.** Assume $f$ is integrable with $\int_a^b f = I$ and let a real $\eta > 0$ be given. By [L4] fix a partition $P_0 = (n_0, t^0)$ with $U(f,P_0) - L(f,P_0) < \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$. [given, L4, L10, choose]

2.1 A partition of mesh below $\delta$ exists: by [L8] fix $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N) < \delta/(b-a)$ and take $P := U_N$, so $\|P\| = (b-a)/\iota(N) < \delta$ by [L1] and [L10]. Write $P = (n,t)$. [step 1.1, L1, L8, L10, choose]

2.2 By [L2] and integrability, $L(f,P_0) \le \underline{\int_a^b} f = I = \overline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,P_0)$. Hence $U(f,P_0) - I \le U(f,P_0) - L(f,P_0) < \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$ and $I - L(f,P_0) \le U(f,P_0) - L(f,P_0) < \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$, that is $U(f,P_0) < I + \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$ and $L(f,P_0) > I - \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$. [step 1.2, L2, L10]

2.3 Put $\delta_0 := \eta \cdot \bigl(8\,M_{+}\,\iota(n_0)\bigr)^{-1}$, a positive real since $M_{+} > 0$ and $\iota(n_0) > 0$ by [L8] and $n_0 \ge 1$ by [L1]. [step 1.2, L1, L8, L10, construct]

3.1 For each $i < n$ the set $X_i := \{\, x \in I_i : f(x) > M_i - \theta \,\}$ is nonempty by [L6], since $M_i = \sup f[I_i]$ and $f[I_i]$ is nonempty by [L1]. By [L7] the finite family $\{X_i : i < n\}$ has a choice function $g$; put $\xi_i := g(X_i)$ for $i < n$ and $\xi_k := b$ for $k \ge n$, a tagging of $P$. [step 2.1, L1, L2, L6, L7, choose]

3.2 Likewise the sets $Y_i := \{\, x \in I_i : f(x) < m_i + \theta \,\}$ are nonempty by [L6], and [L7] supplies a tagging $\zeta$ of $P$ with $\zeta_i \in Y_i$ for $i < n$. [step 2.1, L1, L2, L6, L7, choose]

3.3 Let $(Q,\upsilon)$ be any tagged partition of $[a,b]$ with $\|Q\| < \delta_0$, and write $Q = (n_Q,u)$ and $R := Q \vee P_0$, with $R = (n_R, r)$. By [L1], $R$ refines both $Q$ and $P_0$, and $n_R - n_Q \le n_0 - 1$, so $\iota(n_R - n_Q) \le \iota(n_0)$ by [L8]. [step 2.3, L1, L8, given]

4.1 $S(f,P,\xi) \ge U(f,P) - \varepsilon$: by step 3.1, $f(\xi_i) \ge M_i - \theta$ for $i < n$, so multiplying by $\Delta_i > 0$ and summing gives $S(f,P,\xi) \ge \sum_{i<n}(M_i - \theta)\Delta_i = U(f,P) - \theta\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = U(f,P) - \theta(b-a) = U(f,P) - \varepsilon$, by [L9], [L1] and [L3]. Symmetrically $S(f,P,\zeta) \le L(f,P) + \varepsilon$. [step 3.1, step 3.2, L1, L3, L9, L10]

4.2 By [L5] applied to the refinement $R$ of $Q$, $U(f,Q) - U(f,R) \le 2M_{+}\iota(n_R-n_Q)\|Q\| \le 2M_{+}\iota(n_0)\delta_0 = \eta \cdot 4^{-1}$, and likewise $L(f,R) - L(f,Q) \le \eta \cdot 4^{-1}$. [step 2.3, step 3.3, L5, L8, L10]

5.1 By condition 2 both $|S(f,P,\xi) - I| < \varepsilon$ and $|S(f,P,\zeta) - I| < \varepsilon$, since $\|P\| < \delta$. Hence $U(f,P) \le S(f,P,\xi) + \varepsilon < I + 2\varepsilon$ and $L(f,P) \ge S(f,P,\zeta) - \varepsilon > I - 2\varepsilon$, by step 4.1 and [L10]. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 4.1, L10]

5.2 By [L5] applied to the refinement $R$ of $P_0$, $U(f,R) \le U(f,P_0)$ and $L(f,R) \ge L(f,P_0)$. Combining with step 4.2 and step 2.2: $U(f,Q) \le U(f,R) + \eta \cdot 4^{-1} \le U(f,P_0) + \eta \cdot 4^{-1} < I + \eta \cdot 2^{-1} + \eta \cdot 4^{-1}$, and symmetrically $L(f,Q) > I - \eta \cdot 2^{-1} - \eta \cdot 4^{-1}$. [step 2.2, step 3.3, step 4.2, L5, L10]

6.1 By [L2], $\overline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,P) < I + 2\varepsilon$ and $\underline{\int_a^b} f \ge L(f,P) > I - 2\varepsilon$, and since $\underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f$ by [L2], both integrals lie strictly between $I - 2\varepsilon$ and $I + 2\varepsilon$; in particular $\bigl|\overline{\int_a^b} f - I\bigr| \le 2\varepsilon$ and $\bigl|\underline{\int_a^b} f - I\bigr| \le 2\varepsilon$. [step 5.1, L2, L10]

6.2 By [L3], $L(f,Q) \le S(f,Q,\upsilon) \le U(f,Q)$, so step 5.2 gives $I - \eta \cdot 2^{-1} - \eta \cdot 4^{-1} < S(f,Q,\upsilon) < I + \eta \cdot 2^{-1} + \eta \cdot 4^{-1}$, whence $|S(f,Q,\upsilon) - I| < \eta \cdot 2^{-1} + \eta \cdot 4^{-1} < \eta$ by [L10]. Since $(Q,\upsilon)$ was an arbitrary tagged partition of mesh below $\delta_0$, condition 2 holds with this $\delta_0$. [step 5.2, L3, L10]

7.1 Step 6.1 holds for **every** real $\varepsilon > 0$. If $\overline{\int_a^b} f \ne I$, taking $\varepsilon := \bigl|\overline{\int_a^b} f - I\bigr| \cdot 4^{-1} > 0$ would give $\bigl|\overline{\int_a^b} f - I\bigr| \le \bigl|\overline{\int_a^b} f - I\bigr| \cdot 2^{-1}$, which is false for a positive quantity; so $\overline{\int_a^b} f = I$, and the same argument gives $\underline{\int_a^b} f = I$. Hence $f$ is integrable with $\int_a^b f = I$ by [L2], which is condition 1. [step 6.1, L2, L10]

8.1 Steps 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 5.1, 6.1 and 7.1 prove that condition 2 implies condition 1; steps 1.2, 2.2, 2.3, 3.3, 4.2, 5.2 and 6.2 prove the converse. The two halves share no symbol, the first working with $\varepsilon, \delta, P, \xi, \zeta, \theta$ and the second with $\eta, \delta_0, P_0, Q, \upsilon, R$, and together they give the stated equivalence. [step 7.1, step 6.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the Riemann condition costs in choice: nothing beyond ZF.** The only selection made anywhere above is in steps 3.1 and 3.2, where a tag is picked in each of the $n$ subintervals of one fixed partition. That family is listed by the index $i < n$, and a family of nonempty sets listed by a natural number has a choice function outright ([[lem-finite-choice]]), with no appeal to any choice axiom. Every other existential in the proof is instantiated once. This is recorded in [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].

- **Why the mesh of the coarse partition is the right quantity.** Step 4.2 is the only place where the mesh hypothesis is spent, and it is spent through the quantitative clause of [[lem-refinement-inequalities]]. The symbols there are those of the second half: adding the at most $n_0 - 1$ interior points of $P_0$ to the arbitrary partition $Q$ can change each Darboux sum by at most $2M_{+}$ times the total length of the affected subintervals, and each of those has length below $\delta_0$, the mesh bound imposed on $Q$. The number $n_0$ is fixed **before** $\delta_0$ is chosen, in step 1.2 against step 2.3, which is why the argument is not circular.

- **The two conditions are not symmetric in what they presuppose.** Condition 1 names the integral as a supremum and an infimum and needs the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ to make sense; condition 2 names it as a limit of sums and could be stated over any ordered field. What the theorem says is that on $\mathbb{R}$ the two coincide, so the numerical picture and the order-theoretic one describe the same object.

- **The value $I$ is not a free parameter after the fact.** If condition 2 holds for $I$ and for $I'$ then $|I - I'| < 2\varepsilon$ for every $\varepsilon > 0$, by evaluating both at one tagged partition of small enough mesh, so $I = I'$. The integral is therefore determined by condition 2 alone, as it is by condition 1.
