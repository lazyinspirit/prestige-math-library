## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]).

- A **separation** of $X$ is an ordered pair $(U, V)$ of **open**, **nonempty**,
  **disjoint** subsets of $X$ with $U \cup V = X$.
- $X$ is **disconnected** when a separation of $X$ exists, and **connected** when
  none does.
- A subset $A \subseteq X$ is a **connected subset** of $X$ when the space
  $(A, \mathcal{T}_A)$ is connected, $\mathcal{T}_A$ being the subspace topology
  ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]). "Disconnected subset" is read the same way.

Since $U$ and $V$ are complementary in $X$, each of them is closed as well as
open; so a separation is the same thing as a partition of $X$ into two nonempty
clopen pieces ([[def-topological-space]]). The **clopen** subsets of $X$ are
those that are both open and closed, and $\varnothing$ and $X$ are always among
them.

**The empty space and the one-point space are connected in this library.**
Neither admits a separation: a separation requires two nonempty disjoint sets
whose union is the whole space, and neither $\varnothing$ nor a singleton can be
written as such a union. So both are connected under the definition above,
without any special clause. **This is a live convention fork** and the competing
choice is recorded in [[rem-connectedness-conventions]]; nothing on this page
depends on which is taken except the reading of the word "connected" applied to
those two spaces.

**Connectedness is a property of a space, not of an ambient pair.** The condition
above mentions only $(X,\mathcal{T})$. When it is applied to $A \subseteq X$ it
is applied to the space $(A, \mathcal{T}_A)$, so it does not change if $A$ is
regarded as a subspace of some other space inducing the same topology on $A$; in
particular a subset of $A$ is connected as a subset of $A$ exactly when it is
connected as a subset of $X$, by transitivity of the subspace topology
([[def-subspace-topology-top]]). This is why "connected" may be used of a subset
with no ambient space named.

**Spelled out for a subset.** $A \subseteq X$ is disconnected exactly when there
are open $U, V \subseteq X$ with

$$A \subseteq U \cup V, \qquad U \cap A \ne \varnothing, \qquad V \cap A \ne \varnothing, \qquad U \cap V \cap A = \varnothing,$$

because the open sets of $(A,\mathcal{T}_A)$ are precisely the traces $U \cap A$.
Note the last condition: it asks $U$ and $V$ to be disjoint **on $A$**, not in
$X$. Requiring $U \cap V = \varnothing$ outright is a strictly stronger demand
and is a different notion.

**The two-point discrete space.** Write $\mathbf{2} := \{0,1\}$ with the discrete
topology ([[def-standard-topologies]]), in which every subset is open. A
separation of $X$ is the same datum as a surjective continuous map
$X \to \mathbf{2}$ ([[def-continuous-map-top]]): given $(U,V)$, the map sending
$U$ to $0$ and $V$ to $1$ is continuous because the preimage of each of the four
open subsets of $\mathbf{2}$ is one of $\varnothing$, $U$, $V$, $X$; given a
surjective continuous $\chi : X \to \mathbf{2}$, the pair
$(\chi^{-1}[\{0\}], \chi^{-1}[\{1\}])$ is a separation. This reformulation is
proved as a theorem on this page and is recorded here only to name $\mathbf{2}$.

**Separated sets.** Two subsets $A_1, A_2 \subseteq X$ are **separated in $X$**
when

$$\overline{A_1} \cap A_2 = \varnothing \qquad \text{and} \qquad A_1 \cap \overline{A_2} = \varnothing,$$

closures taken in $X$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]],
[[thm-closure-characterisation-top]]). Separated sets are disjoint, since
$A_1 \subseteq \overline{A_1}$; the converse fails. This is verbatim the
condition [[def-connected-r]] uses on the real line, transported to an arbitrary
space, and the theorem relating it to the definition above is the next lemma on
this page.

**Totally disconnected spaces, and the empty case.** The vocabulary for a space
all of whose connected subsets are single points is fixed later on this page,
together with the components; it is not defined here because it is stated in
terms of components.

## Remarks

- **Why "nonempty" and "disjoint" are both in the definition.** Drop
  *nonempty* and every space with more than one open set is "disconnected" via
  $(X, \varnothing)$. Drop *disjoint* and $(X, X)$ separates every nonempty
  space. Drop *open* and every space with at least two points is separated by a
  point and its complement. Each of the four conditions is doing work, and the
  four together are the weakest demand under which the notion has the
  consequences proved on this page.

- **Ordered pair, not unordered.** A separation is written as a pair for
  convenience only; $(U,V)$ separates exactly when $(V,U)$ does, and no statement
  here distinguishes them.

- **The relation to the real-line definition is proved, not assumed.**
  [[def-connected-r]] defines connectedness of $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ by the
  absence of a partition into two nonempty separated sets, which is a condition
  on closures rather than on relatively open sets. That the two definitions agree
  is [[lem-connected-subsets-and-separated-sets]] together with
  [[cor-connected-subsets-of-the-line]]; until those are proved, the two words
  are kept apart and no statement here quietly identifies them.
