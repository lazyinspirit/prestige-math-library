## Definition

**The factorial.** By the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) applied to the
set $\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$, the starting element $(0,1)$ and the function
$f(k, v) = (\sigma(k),\, v \cdot \sigma(k))$, and by the same induction on the
first coordinate as in [[def-nat-finite-sum-and-product]], there is a unique
$F : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ with

$$F(0) = 1, \qquad F(\sigma(n)) = F(n)\cdot\sigma(n) \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

We write $n! := F(n)$. Thus $0! = 1$, $1! = 0!\cdot 1 = 1$, $2! = 1!\cdot 2 = 2$,
$3! = 6$, $4! = 24$, $5! = 120$, $6! = 720$.

**$0! = 1$ is the base clause of this recursion**, not a convention imported from
elsewhere. Nothing about empty products is presupposed; the agreement with the
empty product is proved below, in clause (a), rather than assumed.

**Truncated difference.** Throughout, $n - k$ is the operation fixed in
[[def-nat-finite-sum-and-product]]: the unique $j$ with $k + j = n$ when
$k \le n$, and $0$ when $n < k$.

**The falling factorial.** For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ define $n^{\underline{k}}$ by
recursion on $k$, by the recursion theorem applied to
$\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ with starting element $(0,1)$ and
$f(k, v) = (\sigma(k),\, v \cdot (n-k))$:

$$n^{\underline{0}} = 1, \qquad n^{\underline{\sigma(k)}} = n^{\underline{k}}\cdot(n-k) .$$

So $n^{\underline{1}} = 1\cdot(n-0) = n$ and $n^{\underline{2}} = n\,(n-1)$, and
for $k \le n$ the value is the product $n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1)$ of the $k$ topmost
factors.

**Four facts, proved here because the page uses each of them.**

**(a) The factorial is the product of the first $n$ positive naturals.**
$n! = \prod_{j<n}\sigma(j) = \prod_{j<n}(j+1)$, the $\mathbb{N}$-valued product of
[[def-nat-finite-sum-and-product]]. Induction ([[thm-induction-principle]]): at
$n = 0$ both sides are $1$, the empty product and the base clause agreeing; and
$\prod_{j<\sigma(n)}\sigma(j) = \big(\prod_{j<n}\sigma(j)\big)\cdot\sigma(n) = n!\cdot\sigma(n) = \sigma(n)!$.
**So the empty-product reading and the base-clause reading are the same reading**,
and neither was assumed.

**(b) $n! \ne 0$, and $\iota(n!) = \prod^{\mathbb{R}}_{j<n}\iota(j+1)$.** For the
first, $0! = 1 \ne 0$ ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]) and
$\sigma(n)! = n!\cdot\sigma(n)$ is a product of two nonzero naturals, which is
nonzero: if $xy = 0$ with $y \ne 0$ then $xy = 0\cdot y$
([[lem-nat-mult-identity]]) and cancellation gives $x = 0$
([[lem-nat-mult-cancellative]]). So $n! \ne 0$ for every $n$ by induction. For the second, apply the bridge clause
6 of that lemma to clause (a) above. This is what makes the factorial of this
page and the real-valued product $\prod_{j<n}(j+1)$ used elsewhere in the library
**one object seen twice**, rather than two unrelated notions.

**(c) $n^{\underline{k}}\cdot(n-k)! = n!$ for $k \le n$.** Induction on $k$, for
all $n$ at once. At $k = 0$ this reads $1 \cdot n! = n!$. Assume it at $k$ and
let $\sigma(k) \le n$; then $k \le n$, and writing $d := n - k$ we have
$k + d = n$ and $d \ne 0$, since $k + 0 = k \ne n$; so $d = \sigma(e)$ for a
unique $e$ ([[lem-nat-nonzero-is-successor]]), and $\sigma(k) + e = n$, that is
$e = n - \sigma(k)$ ([[lem-nat-add-cancellative]]). Therefore
$n^{\underline{\sigma(k)}}\cdot\big(n-\sigma(k)\big)! = n^{\underline{k}}\cdot(n-k)\cdot e! = n^{\underline{k}}\cdot\big(e!\cdot\sigma(e)\big) = n^{\underline{k}}\cdot\sigma(e)! = n^{\underline{k}}\cdot(n-k)! = n!$,
using commutativity and associativity of multiplication
([[lem-nat-mult-associative]], [[lem-nat-mult-commutative]]) and the recursion
clause for the factorial.

**(d) Boundary values.** $n^{\underline{0}} = 1$ for every $n$, by the base
clause; $n^{\underline{n}} = n!$, since clause (c) at $k = n$ gives
$n^{\underline{n}}\cdot 0! = n!$ and $0! = 1$; and
$n^{\underline{k}} = 0$ whenever $k > n$. For the last, $n - n = 0$ gives
$n^{\underline{\sigma(n)}} = n^{\underline{n}}\cdot 0 = 0$, the clause
$x \cdot 0 = 0$ being definitional ([[def-nat-multiplication]]), and if
$n^{\underline{k}} = 0$ then
$n^{\underline{\sigma(k)}} = 0$ as well, so $n^{\underline{k}} = 0$ for every
$k \ge \sigma(n)$ by induction.

## Remarks

- **Why $0! = 1$ is not imported.** The empty-product convention of an arbitrary
  monoid is fixed in [[def-monoid-finite-product]], which comes later in the
  reading order, so citing it here would be a dependency pointing the wrong way.
  Taking $0! = 1$ as the base clause of the factorial's own recursion costs
  nothing and owes nothing, and clause (a) then records the agreement.

- **The library's other factorial.** [[lem-factorial-beats-geometric]], later in
  the reading order, works with a real-valued factorial defined as the product
  $\prod_{j<n}(j+1)$ in $\mathbb{R}$. Clause (b) says that this is exactly
  $\iota(n!)$, so the two agree and no second notion has been created. That
  pointer is orientation only.

- **Check every clause at $k = 0$ and at $k = n$.** The falling factorial is
  defined by two regimes, one for $k \le n$ and one beyond, and the recursion
  above covers both because the truncated difference is $0$ past the end. The
  two values that get used constantly are $n^{\underline{0}} = 1$ and
  $n^{\underline{n}} = n!$, and both are clause (d).
