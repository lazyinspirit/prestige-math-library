## Statement refuted

**Refuted claim:** every set of measure zero has content zero
([[fs-null-implies-content-zero]]).

The witness is $E := \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \cap [0,1]$, the rationals of the
unit interval ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]], [[def-interval]]). It is at most
countable, hence null; it is bounded; and every finite family of intervals
covering it has total length at least $1$, because the union of finitely many
closed intervals is closed and contains the closure of $E$, which is all of
$[0,1]$. The refutation is carried out in full in
[[fs-null-implies-content-zero]]; this item records the witness and says what
makes it work.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The set $E = \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \cap [0,1]$.

[A1] The refuted claim: every subset of $\mathbb{R}$ of measure zero has content zero.

[L1] $E$ is at most countable, being a subset of the countable set $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, and therefore null ([[thm-rationals-countable]], [[lem-subset-of-countable]], [[def-countable]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]], [[lem-countable-sets-are-null]]).

[L2] Every point of $[0,1]$ is adherent to $E$, so any closed set containing $E$ contains $[0,1]$; and a finite union of closed intervals is closed ([[fs-null-implies-content-zero]], [[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L3] A finite family of closed intervals covering $[0,1]$ has total length at least $1$ ([[lem-finite-interval-cover-total-length]]).

[L4] Content zero means a finite cover of total length below every positive $\varepsilon$; on compact sets content zero and measure zero coincide ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]], [[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]]).

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $E$ has measure zero by [L1], and $E \subseteq [0,1]$ is bounded. [L1]

1.2 Any finite family of closed intervals covering $E$ has total length at least $1$: its union is closed by [L2] and contains $E$, hence contains $[0,1]$ by [L2], and [L3] applies. [L2, L3]

2.1 So $E$ does not have content zero, since a witness at $\varepsilon = 2^{-1}$ would give a finite cover of total length at most $2^{-1} < 1$; $E$ therefore witnesses the failure of [A1]. [step 1.1, step 1.2, A1, L4] ∎

## Remarks

- **Boundedness is not what is missing.** $E$ is bounded, and its failure is as
  large as it can be: no finite cover does better than the trivial cover of
  $[0,1]$ by itself. What $E$ lacks is closedness, and hence compactness; adding
  it repairs the implication completely ([[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]]).

- **The closure is the whole obstruction.** Content zero is insensitive to
  passing to the closure, since a finite union of closed intervals is closed,
  whereas measure zero is not: $E$ is null and $\overline{E} = [0,1]$ is not
  ([[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]]). That single asymmetry is the
  entire difference between the two notions.

- **Compare the compact case.** The Cantor set is uncountable and null, and being
  compact it also has content zero ([[thm-cantor-set-properties]]). So the failure
  here is not about cardinality: a much larger null set can have content zero,
  and a countable one need not.
