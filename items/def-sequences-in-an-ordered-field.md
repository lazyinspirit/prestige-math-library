## Definition

Throughout, $F$ is an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with its order and
its absolute value $|\cdot|$ ([[def-abs-value]]), and $\mathbb{N}$ is the set of
natural numbers with its order ([[def-natural-numbers]], [[def-nat-order]]).

A **sequence in $F$** is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to F$. We write $x_k$ for
$x(k)$ and $(x_k)$, or $(x_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$, for the function itself.

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence in $F$.

- $(x_k)$ is **bounded** when there is $M \in F$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for every
  $k \in \mathbb{N}$.
- $(x_k)$ **converges to** $L \in F$ when

  $$\text{for every } \varepsilon \in F \text{ with } \varepsilon > 0 \text{ there is } N \in \mathbb{N} \text{ such that } |x_k - L| < \varepsilon \text{ for all } k \ge N.$$

  We then write $x_k \to L$ *in $F$*. The sequence is **convergent in $F$** when
  it converges to some $L \in F$, and **divergent in $F$** otherwise.
- $(x_k)$ is **Cauchy in $F$** when

  $$\text{for every } \varepsilon \in F \text{ with } \varepsilon > 0 \text{ there is } N \in \mathbb{N} \text{ such that } |x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon \text{ for all } k, l \ge N.$$

- $(x_k)$ is **nondecreasing** when $x_j \le x_k$ for all $j \le k$,
  **increasing** when $x_j < x_k$ for all $j < k$, **nonincreasing** when
  $x_j \ge x_k$ for all $j \le k$, **decreasing** when $x_j > x_k$ for all
  $j < k$, and **monotone** when it is nondecreasing or nonincreasing.
- For a strictly increasing $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$, the **subsequence**
  of $(x_k)$ along $n$ is the composite $(x_{n_j})_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$. An
  element $L \in F$ is a **subsequential limit** of $(x_k)$ when some
  subsequence of $(x_k)$ converges to $L$ in $F$.

**Closed intervals and nesting.** For $a, b \in F$ with $a \le b$, the **closed
interval** with endpoints $a$ and $b$ is

$$[a,b]_F \;:=\; \{\, x \in F : a \le x \le b \,\},$$

and its **length** is $b - a \ge 0$. A sequence $(I_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of
closed intervals $I_k = [a_k, b_k]_F$ is **nested** when $I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k$
for every $k$. Its **lengths tend to $0$ in $F$** when the sequence
$(b_k - a_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges to $0$ in the sense above, that is,
when for every $\varepsilon > 0$ in $F$ there is $N \in \mathbb{N}$ with
$b_k - a_k < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge N$ (the absolute value may be dropped
because each length is $\ge 0$).

## Remarks

- **The thresholds range over $F$, and that is not a stylistic choice.** In an
  Archimedean ordered field one may equivalently test $\varepsilon$ over the
  canonical rationals, and that is what the $\mathbb{R}$-specific
  [[def-real-limit]] does; the two agree there, as the remark on rational and
  real $\varepsilon$ in [[def-sequence]] records. In a general $F$ they do
  **not** agree, because the canonical rationals need not be cofinal below the
  positive elements. A concrete failure lives on this page: in
  $\mathbb{R}((t^{-1}))$ every positive rational constant exceeds $t^{-1}$
  (clause 4 of [[lem-laurent-non-archimedean]], since a nonzero constant is
  nonzero at index $0$), so the sequence taking the value $0$ at even indices
  and $t^{-1}$ at odd indices would satisfy the Cauchy condition read with
  rational thresholds only, while failing it at $\varepsilon = t^{-2}$, where
  consecutive terms differ by $t^{-1} > t^{-2}$; and it has no limit at all,
  since a convergent sequence is Cauchy by the triangle inequality. Every
  definition above therefore
  quantifies over $\varepsilon \in F$, and no proof in this library may
  substitute a rational threshold in a field that has not been shown to be
  Archimedean.

- **These are the $\mathbb{R}$-notions with $\mathbb{R}$ replaced by $F$, and
  nothing more.** Sequence, tail, subsequence and boundedness are
  [[def-sequence]]; monotonicity is [[def-monotone-sequence]]; subsequential
  limits are [[def-subsequential-limit]]; convergence and Cauchyness are
  [[def-real-limit]]; closed intervals are the form $[a,b]$ of
  [[def-interval]]. Only the field in which the inequalities are read has
  changed.

- **Transfer of theorems is not automatic, and citing an $\mathbb{R}$-item for a
  general $F$ is a citation error.** A result proved about sequences of reals is
  a statement about $\mathbb{R}$. Many such proofs use only the ordered-field
  axioms and go through for any $F$ verbatim, and many others use completeness
  or the Archimedean property and do not. Which is which has to be settled by
  reading the proof; until an item is stated for a general ordered field, it may
  not be cited for one.

- **Limits are unique in any ordered field.** If $x_k \to L$ and $x_k \to L'$
  in $F$ with $L \ne L'$, put $\varepsilon := |L - L'|/2$, which is positive
  because $|L-L'| > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]) and $2 = 1 + 1 > 0$. Choose $N$
  beyond which both $|x_k - L| < \varepsilon$ and $|x_k - L'| < \varepsilon$
  hold, and take any $k \ge N$: the triangle inequality
  ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]], proved for an arbitrary ordered field) gives
  $|L - L'| \le |L - x_k| + |x_k - L'| < 2\varepsilon = |L - L'|$, which is
  impossible. So the limit, when it exists, is unique, and the notation
  $\lim_k x_k$ is unambiguous. No completeness and no Archimedean hypothesis is
  used.

- **Indexing starts at $0$**, as everywhere in this library, because
  $0 \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]). A nested sequence of intervals
  therefore begins with $I_0$, and a statement about "the first $N$ terms" means
  the indices $0, \dots, N-1$.
