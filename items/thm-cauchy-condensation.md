## Statement

Let $(a_k)_{k \ge 1}$ be a family from $1$ ([[def-series]]) with

$$a_k \ge 0 \ \ (k \ge 1) \qquad \text{and} \qquad a_j \ge a_k \ \ \text{whenever } 1 \le j \le k .$$

Then

$$\sum_{k \ge 1} a_k \ \text{converges} \qquad \Longleftrightarrow \qquad \sum_{j \ge 0} 2^{j} a_{2^{j}} \ \text{converges} .$$

Every term of the condensed series is defined, because $2^{j} \ge 1$ for every
$j \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[lem-power-monotone]]), and the condensed series starts at
$j = 0$, its first term being $2^0 a_{2^0} = a_1$.

The monotonicity hypothesis is equivalent to the consecutive form
$a_{k+1} \le a_k$ for every $k \ge 1$, since it says that the sequence
$b_i := a_{i+1}$, $i \in \mathbb{N}$, is nonincreasing ([[def-monotone-sequence]]).
It cannot be dropped: the companion page exhibits a nonnegative non-monotone
family for which the two series behave differently.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A family $(a_k)_{k \ge 1}$ of reals with $a_k \ge 0$ for $k \ge 1$ and $a_j \ge a_k$ whenever $1 \le j \le k$; the partial sums $A_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k$ of $\sum_{k \ge 1} a_k$, with $A_0 = 0$; and the partial sums $C_n = \sum_{j<n} 2^{j} a_{2^{j}}$ of the condensed series ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[L1] Splitting of finite sums, and the meaning of a sum with general bounds: for $m \le n$, $\sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k = \sum_{k=1}^{m} a_k + \sum_{k=m+1}^{n} a_k$, and $\sum_{k=p}^{q} a_k = \sum_{t < q+1-p} a_{p+t}$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[L2] Monotonicity and scaling of finite sums: if $x_t \le y_t$ for all $t < d$ then $\sum_{t<d} x_t \le \sum_{t<d} y_t$; and a constant sum is $\sum_{t<d} \lambda = d\,\lambda$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L3] Powers of $2$: $2^{j} \ge 1$ for every $j \in \mathbb{N}$, $2^{j+1} = 2 \cdot 2^{j}$, and $2^{j} < 2^{j+1}$ ([[def-integer-power]], [[lem-power-monotone]]).

[L4] The principle of induction ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L5] For a series of nonnegative terms: its partial sums are nondecreasing, it converges if and only if the range of its partial sums is bounded above, and in the convergent case every partial sum is at most the sum ([[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Every term of the condensed series is nonnegative, since $2^{j} \ge 1 > 0$ and $a_{2^{j}} \ge 0$; and every $A_n$, every $C_n$ is nonnegative, both series having nonnegative terms. [given, L3, L5]

1.2 For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the block from $2^{n}$ to $2^{n+1}-1$ is $\sum_{k=2^{n}}^{2^{n+1}-1} a_k = \sum_{t < 2^{n}} a_{2^{n}+t}$, since the number of terms is $(2^{n+1}-1)+1-2^{n} = 2^{n}$. [L1, L3, algebra]

1.3 For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the block from $2^{n}+1$ to $2^{n+1}$ is $\sum_{k=2^{n}+1}^{2^{n+1}} a_k = \sum_{t < 2^{n}} a_{2^{n}+1+t}$, since the number of terms is $2^{n+1}+1-(2^{n}+1) = 2^{n}$. [L1, L3, algebra]

1.4 **Index growth:** $n \le 2^{n} - 1$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, by induction on $n$. At $n = 0$ this reads $0 \le 0$; and if $n \le 2^{n}-1$, that is $n+1 \le 2^{n}$, then $n+1 \le 2^{n} \le 2 \cdot 2^{n} - 1 = 2^{n+1}-1$, the second inequality being $2^{n} \ge 1$. [L3, L4, algebra]

2.1 In the first block every index satisfies $2^{n} \le 2^{n}+t$, so $a_{2^{n}+t} \le a_{2^{n}}$, and therefore $\sum_{k=2^{n}}^{2^{n+1}-1} a_k \le \sum_{t<2^{n}} a_{2^{n}} = 2^{n} a_{2^{n}}$. [step 1.2, given, L2]

2.2 In the second block every index satisfies $2^{n}+1+t \le 2^{n+1}$ for $t < 2^{n}$, so $a_{2^{n}+1+t} \ge a_{2^{n+1}}$, and therefore $\sum_{k=2^{n}+1}^{2^{n+1}} a_k \ge \sum_{t<2^{n}} a_{2^{n+1}} = 2^{n} a_{2^{n+1}}$. [step 1.3, given, L2, L3]

2.3 Suppose the condensed series converges, with sum $C$; then $C_n \le C$ for every $n$. [given, step 1.1, L5]

2.4 Suppose conversely that $\sum_{k \ge 1} a_k$ converges, with sum $A$; then $A_n \le A$ for every $n$. [given, step 1.1, L5]

3.1 **Upper estimate:** $A_{2^{n}-1} \le C_n$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, by induction on $n$. At $n = 0$ both sides are $0$, since $2^0 - 1 = 0$ and $C_0$ is the empty sum; and if $A_{2^{n}-1} \le C_n$, then splitting at $2^{n}-1$ gives $A_{2^{n+1}-1} = A_{2^{n}-1} + \sum_{k=2^{n}}^{2^{n+1}-1} a_k \le C_n + 2^{n} a_{2^{n}} = C_{n+1}$. [step 2.1, L1, L3, L4]

3.2 **Lower estimate:** $2 A_{2^{n}} \ge \sum_{j=1}^{n} 2^{j} a_{2^{j}}$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, by induction on $n$. At $n = 0$ the right-hand side is the empty sum $0$ and the left-hand side is $2a_1 \ge 0$; and if the inequality holds at $n$, then splitting at $2^{n}$ gives $A_{2^{n+1}} = A_{2^{n}} + \sum_{k=2^{n}+1}^{2^{n+1}} a_k \ge A_{2^{n}} + 2^{n} a_{2^{n+1}}$, whence $2A_{2^{n+1}} \ge 2A_{2^{n}} + 2^{n+1} a_{2^{n+1}} \ge \sum_{j=1}^{n+1} 2^{j} a_{2^{j}}$. [step 2.2, step 1.1, L1, L3, L4]

4.1 For every $N \in \mathbb{N}$ we have $N \le 2^{N}-1$, so $A_N \le A_{2^{N}-1} \le C_N \le C$, the first inequality because the partial sums $A_n$ are nondecreasing. [step 1.4, step 3.1, step 2.3, step 1.1, L5]

4.2 For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $\sum_{j=1}^{n} 2^{j} a_{2^{j}} \le 2 A_{2^{n}} \le 2A$, and splitting the condensed partial sum at $j = 1$ gives $C_{n+1} = a_1 + \sum_{j=1}^{n} 2^{j} a_{2^{j}} \le a_1 + 2A$. [step 3.2, step 2.4, L1, L3]

5.1 So the partial sums of $\sum_{k \ge 1} a_k$ are bounded above by $C$, and that series converges. [step 4.1, L5]

5.2 Also $C_0 = 0 \le a_1 + 2A$, so every condensed partial sum is at most $a_1 + 2A$, and the condensed series converges. [step 4.2, step 1.1, L5]

6.1 The two implications just established combine, so the two series converge or diverge together. [step 5.1, step 5.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **What monotonicity buys, in one sentence.** It lets a block of $2^{n}$ consecutive terms be squeezed between $2^{n}$ copies of its last term and $2^{n}$ copies of its first, which is exactly the pair of estimates in steps 2.1 and 2.2. Without it a block carries no information about any single term in it, and the two series decouple entirely.

- **The factor $2$ in the lower estimate is not an artefact.** The blocks used for the two estimates are different: the upper estimate groups $2^{n}, \dots, 2^{n+1}-1$ and the lower estimate groups $2^{n}+1, \dots, 2^{n+1}$, and the second grouping produces $2^{n} a_{2^{n+1}}$, which is half of the condensed term $2^{n+1} a_{2^{n+1}}$. Since only boundedness of the partial sums is at stake, a constant factor is harmless.

- **Base $2$ is a choice, not a necessity.** The same argument with blocks of length $c^{n}$ gives the analogous test for any integer $c \ge 2$. Base $2$ is taken here because it is the one every later application uses, and because the arithmetic of $2^{n+1} = 2 \cdot 2^{n}$ keeps the induction free of extra bookkeeping.
