## Statement

A Sylow $p$-subgroup of a finite group is normal if and only if it is the unique Sylow $p$-subgroup. See [[thm-sylow-second-theorem]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The hypotheses and objects in the Statement.

[L1] Let $G$ be finite, let $P$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup, and let $H\le G$ be a $p$-subgroup. There is $g\in G$ with $H\le gPg^{-1}$. In particular, for every Sylow $p$-subgroup $Q$ there is $g\in G$ with $Q=gPg^{-1}$, so the Sylow $p$-subgroups form one conjugacy class. ([[thm-sylow-second-theorem]]).

[L2] For a finite group $G$ and a prime $p$, let $\operatorname{Syl}_p(G)$ be the set of Sylow $p$-subgroups (def-sylow-p-subgroup). Define $$n_p(G):=|\operatorname{Syl}_p(G)|.$$ This cardinal is defined even before existence is proved because $\operatorname{Syl}_p(G)$ is a subset of the finite power set of $G$; thm-sylow-first-theorem later shows it is nonzero. ([[def-number-of-sylow-p-subgroups]]).

[L3] Let $G$ be a group and let $N\le G$ be a subgroup (def-subgroup). For $g\in G$, write $$gNg^{-1}:=\{gng^{-1}:n\in N\}.$$ The subgroup $N$ is normal in $G$ when $$gNg^{-1}=N\qquad\text{for every }g\in G.$$ In that case write $N\mathrel{\trianglelefteq}G$. Equivalently, every inner conjugation of $G$ maps $N$ onto itself. The connection with equality of the left and right cosets of def-coset is proved in thm-normal-subgroup-characterisations. ([[def-normal-subgroup]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 A normal Sylow subgroup is fixed by every conjugation, and Sylow II says every Sylow subgroup is one of its conjugates. [L1, L2, L3, given, algebra]

2.1 Conversely, uniqueness makes the subgroup conjugation-invariant. This proves the stated claim. [step 1.1, given, algebra] ∎
