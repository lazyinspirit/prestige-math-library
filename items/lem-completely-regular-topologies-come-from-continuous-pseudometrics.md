## Statement

The topology of a completely regular space is induced by the gauge of pseudometrics $p_f(x,y)=|f(x)-f(y)|$, where $f:X\to[0,1]$ ranges over continuous maps.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A completely regular space $X$.

[L1] Complete regularity separates a point from a closed set by a continuous $[0,1]$-valued function ([[def-completely-regular-and-tychonoff-spaces]], [[def-interval]]).

[L2] Such functions are continuous in the neighbourhood sense ([[def-continuous-map-top]]).

[L3] A gauge generates a uniformity from finite simultaneous pseudometric balls ([[def-gauge-of-pseudometrics]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 For each continuous $f:X\to[0,1]$, $p_f(x,y)=|f(x)-f(y)|$ is a pseudometric, and its balls about $x$ are original-open by [L2]. [L2, construct]

1.2 Conversely, if $x\in U$ is original-open, apply [L1] to the closed set $X\setminus U$ to obtain $f$ with $f(x)=1$ and $f[X\setminus U]=\{0\}$; then the $p_f$-ball of radius $1/2$ about $x$ lies in $U$. [L1, L3, choose]

2.1 Hence every gauge-open set is original-open. [step 1.1, L3]

3.1 Thus original-open and gauge-open sets contain one another, so the two topologies agree. [step 2.1, step 1.2, discharge-construct] ∎
