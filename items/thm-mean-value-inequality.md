## Statement

Let $m \in \mathbb{N}$ with $m \ge 1$, let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$,
and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$ be continuous on $[a,b]$ and
differentiable at every point of $(a,b)$ as a function on $[a,b]$
([[def-vector-valued-functions-limits-and-continuity]],
[[def-vector-valued-derivative-and-integral]], [[def-interval]]). Let
$M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $M \ge 0$ satisfy

$$\lVert f'(t)\rVert_2 \;\le\; M \qquad \text{for every } t \in (a,b).$$

Then

$$\lVert f(b) - f(a)\rVert_2 \;\le\; M\,(b-a).$$

**No integrability of $f'$ is assumed**, so the theorem applies to every
differentiable $f$; that is why it is proved from the scalar mean value theorem
rather than from
[[thm-norm-inequality-for-the-vector-valued-integral]].
[[cor-vector-valued-ftc-and-lipschitz-bound]] records the comparison between the
two routes.

**The equality form is not asserted, and for $m \ge 2$ it is false.** There need
be **no** $\xi \in (a,b)$ with $f(b)-f(a) = f'(\xi)(b-a)$; the companion page
carries a differentiable witness on $[0,1]$. The $\xi$ produced in the proof
below depends on the fixed vector $u = f(b)-f(a)$ and is a mean value point of
the **real** function $t \mapsto \langle u, f(t)\rangle$, not of $f$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural $m \ge 1$, reals $a < b$, a function $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$ continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$, a real $M \ge 0$ bounding $\lVert f'\rVert_2$ on $(a,b)$, the vector $u := f(b)-f(a) \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$, and the real-valued function $\varphi : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, $\varphi(t) := \langle u, f(t)\rangle$.

[L1] The inner product is bilinear and symmetric, $\langle w,w\rangle = \lVert w\rVert_2^{2}$, and $\langle u,w\rangle = \sum_{i<m}u_iw_i$ ([[def-euclidean-inner-product]], [[def-p-norms-on-rn]]).

[L2] Cauchy-Schwarz: $|\langle u,w\rangle| \le \lVert u\rVert_2\lVert w\rVert_2$, and $t \le |t|$ ([[thm-cauchy-schwarz-and-the-euclidean-norm]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]); $\lVert w\rVert_2 \ge 0$, and $\lVert w\rVert_2 = 0$ exactly when $w = 0$ ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]).

[L3] Componentwise continuity and differentiability: $f$ is continuous at a point exactly when every $f_i$ is, and differentiable at a point exactly when every $f_i$ is, with $f'(t)_i = f_i'(t)$ ([[thm-componentwise-limits-and-continuity]] clause 1, [[def-vector-valued-derivative-and-integral]], [[def-derivative]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L4] For a real domain, the metric notion of continuity and the notion of [[def-continuity-real]] agree ([[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]] clause 1).

[L5] Algebra of continuous real functions: sums and scalar multiples of functions continuous at a point are continuous there ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]] clause 1).

[L6] Algebra of derivatives: sums and scalar multiples of functions differentiable at a point are differentiable there, with $(w+z)'(c) = w'(c)+z'(c)$ and $(\alpha w)'(c) = \alpha w'(c)$ ([[thm-algebra-of-derivatives]] clauses 1 and 2); and a differentiable function is continuous ([[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]]).

[L7] The mean value theorem: for $\psi$ continuous on $[a,b]$ with $a<b$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$ there is $\xi \in (a,b)$ with $\psi(b)-\psi(a) = \psi'(\xi)(b-a)$ ([[cor-mean-value-theorem]]).

[L8] Laws of finite sums and induction ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[def-finite-sum]], [[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L9] Order arithmetic: $b - a > 0$; a product of nonnegatives is nonnegative; and $u>0$ gives $u^{-1}>0$, so an inequality may be multiplied by a positive real ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Every component $f_i$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ in the sense of [[def-continuity-real]] and differentiable at every point of $(a,b)$, with $f'(t)_i = f_i'(t)$. [L3, L4]

1.2 $\varphi(t) = \sum_{i<m}u_i f_i(t)$ by the coordinate formula for the inner product. [L1]

1.3 $\varphi(b)-\varphi(a) = \langle u, f(b)\rangle - \langle u, f(a)\rangle = \langle u, f(b)-f(a)\rangle = \langle u,u\rangle = \lVert u\rVert_2^{2}$, by bilinearity. [L1]

1.4 By Cauchy-Schwarz and the bound on $\lVert f'\rVert_2$, $\langle u,f'(\xi)\rangle \le \bigl|\langle u,f'(\xi)\rangle\bigr| \le \lVert u\rVert_2\lVert f'(\xi)\rVert_2 \le \lVert u\rVert_2 M$. [L2]

1.5 If $u = 0$ then $\lVert u\rVert_2 = 0$ while $M(b-a) \ge 0$, so the conclusion holds. [L2, L9]

2.1 By induction on $p \le m$, each partial sum $t \mapsto \sum_{i<p}u_i f_i(t)$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$ with derivative $\sum_{i<p}u_i f_i'(t)$: the empty sum is the constant $0$, and each successor step adds one scalar multiple of a function that is continuous and differentiable by step 1.1. [step 1.1, L5, L6, L8]

3.1 Hence $\varphi$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, differentiable at every point of $(a,b)$, and $\varphi'(t) = \sum_{i<m}u_i f_i'(t) = \langle u, f'(t)\rangle$ for $t \in (a,b)$. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L1]

4.1 By the mean value theorem applied to $\varphi$ there is $\xi \in (a,b)$ with $\varphi(b)-\varphi(a) = \varphi'(\xi)(b-a)$. [step 3.1, L7]

5.1 Combining steps 1.3 and 4.1, $\lVert u\rVert_2^{2} = \langle u, f'(\xi)\rangle\,(b-a)$. [step 3.1, step 1.3, step 4.1]

6.1 Since $b-a > 0$, multiplying the inequality of step 1.4 by $b-a$ and using step 5.1 gives $\lVert u\rVert_2^{2} \le \lVert u\rVert_2\,M\,(b-a)$. [step 5.1, step 1.4, L9]

7.1 If $u \ne 0$ then $\lVert u\rVert_2 > 0$, and multiplying step 6.1 by the positive real $1/\lVert u\rVert_2$ gives $\lVert u\rVert_2 \le M(b-a)$. [step 6.1, L2, L9]

8.1 The two cases of steps 1.5 and 7.1 exhaust the possibilities for $u = f(b)-f(a)$, so $\lVert f(b)-f(a)\rVert_2 \le M(b-a)$. [step 1.5, step 7.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the auxiliary function buys.** The scalar mean value theorem produces a point at which one real function has its average slope. Applying it to $\varphi = \langle u, f\rangle$ for the **particular** $u = f(b)-f(a)$ turns that into a statement about $f$, at the cost of the equality becoming an inequality. The loss is not an artefact of the proof: the equality form is genuinely false for $m \ge 2$, and the companion page's curve $t \mapsto (t^{2},t^{3})$ on $[0,1]$ is a differentiable witness.

- **The bound is sharp.** No constant smaller than $\sup\lVert f'\rVert_2$ works in general; the companion page exhibits a curve for which the inequality is an equality.

- **The case split at $u = 0$ is where the statement would otherwise be incomplete**, exactly as in [[thm-norm-inequality-for-the-vector-valued-integral]]. When $f(b) = f(a)$ the left-hand side is $0$ and nothing is divided.

- **$M \ge 0$ is a hypothesis, not a deduction.** It follows from $\lVert f'(t)\rVert_2 \le M$ at any single $t \in (a,b)$, and $(a,b)$ is nonempty here because $a<b$; it is stated anyway so that the conclusion reads as a genuine bound, in the style of [[cor-bounded-derivative-implies-lipschitz]].
