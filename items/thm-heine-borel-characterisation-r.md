## Statement

Let $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $K$ is compact ([[def-open-cover-r]]) if and
only if $K$ is closed ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) and bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]).

This is the Heine-Borel theorem in the form used everywhere below. The forward
implication is [[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]] and spends no
completeness, only the Archimedean property and the existence of maxima of
finite sets; the backward implication rests on
[[thm-heine-borel-r]] and therefore on the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$, and the
remarks below record where it fails without completeness.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] Open cover, finite subfamily and compactness; the empty subfamily covers $\varnothing$ ([[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L2] A compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is closed and bounded ([[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]]).

[L3] Every closed bounded interval $[\ell,u]$ with $\ell \le u$ is compact ([[thm-heine-borel-r]]).

[L4] $K$ is closed exactly when $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L5] $K$ is bounded exactly when there are $\ell, u \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\ell \le y \le u$ for every $y \in K$ ([[def-bounded-set]]).

[L6] $[\ell,u] = \{\, z \in \mathbb{R} : \ell \le z \le u \,\}$ ([[def-interval]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 If $K$ is compact then $K$ is closed and bounded, which is [L2]; this is the forward implication. [L2]

1.2 For the backward implication assume $K$ is closed and bounded. If $K = \varnothing$ then every open cover of $K$ admits the empty subfamily as a finite subcover, so $K$ is compact. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.3 Assume moreover $K \ne \varnothing$; fix $s \in K$ and, by [L5], reals $\ell, u$ with $\ell \le y \le u$ for every $y \in K$. Then $\ell \le s \le u$, so $\ell \le u$, and $K \subseteq [\ell,u]$ by [L6]. [assume-hyp, L5, L6, choose]

2.1 Let $\mathcal{U}$ be an open cover of $K$ and put $\mathcal{W} := \mathcal{U} \cup \{\mathbb{R} \setminus K\}$. Every member of $\mathcal{W}$ is open, since $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$ is open by [L4], and $\mathcal{W}$ covers $[\ell,u]$: a point of $[\ell,u]$ either lies in $K$, hence in some member of $\mathcal{U}$, or lies outside $K$, hence in $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$. [step 1.3, L1, L4]

3.1 By [L3] the interval $[\ell,u]$ is compact, so some finite subfamily $\{W_0, \dots, W_p\}$ of $\mathcal{W}$ covers $[\ell,u]$, where the case of an empty subfamily is possible only when $[\ell,u] = \varnothing$, which is excluded by $\ell \le u$. Put $\mathcal{V} := \{\, W_i : W_i \in \mathcal{U} \,\}$, a finite subfamily of $\mathcal{U}$. Then $K \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{V}$: a point $y \in K \subseteq [\ell,u]$ lies in some $W_i$, and $W_i$ cannot be a member of $\mathcal{W}$ outside $\mathcal{U}$, because the only such member is $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$ and $y \in K$; so $W_i \in \mathcal{U}$ and $W_i \in \mathcal{V}$. [step 2.1, L1, L3, L6]

4.1 Every open cover of a nonempty closed bounded $K$ therefore has a finite subcover, so such a $K$ is compact; together with the empty case of step 1.2 this proves the backward implication, and step 1.1 is the forward one. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 3.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **A closed subset of a compact set is compact.** If $C \subseteq K$ with $K$
  compact and $C$ closed, then $C$ is bounded, being a subset of a bounded set,
  and closed by hypothesis, so it is compact by the theorem. The corresponding
  statement for arbitrary subsets is false: $(0,1) \subseteq [0,1]$ is bounded
  and not compact ([[cex-unbounded-closed-set-not-compact]]).

- **Both hypotheses are needed and neither implies the other.**
  [[cex-unbounded-closed-set-not-compact]] exhibits a closed set that is not
  bounded and a bounded set that is not closed, and neither is compact.

- **What the theorem is not.** It characterises compactness *for subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$*. The two halves are of very different strengths: the forward
  half is elementary and general, while the backward half rests on the
  completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ and fails over $\mathbb{Q}$
  ([[fs-closed-bounded-compact-without-completeness]], witnessed by
  [[cex-closed-bounded-in-q-not-compact]]). Nothing here licenses "closed and
  bounded implies compact" in any other setting.
