## Definition

Throughout, $m \in \mathbb{N}$ with $m \ge 1$, and $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ carries the
Euclidean norm $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ of [[def-euclidean-inner-product]] and
[[def-p-norms-on-rn]], whose induced metric is the published $d_2$
([[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]],
[[lem-metrics-on-rn]]). A function into $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ is called
**vector-valued**.

### Continuity

Let $(X, d_X)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]), let $A \subseteq X$
carry the restricted metric $d_A$ ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]), let
$f : A \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$ and let $a \in A$. Then $f$ is **continuous at $a$**
when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ d_X(x,a) < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ \lVert f(x) - f(a)\rVert_2 < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

with $\varepsilon, \delta$ ranging over the positive reals, and **continuous on
$A$** when it is continuous at every point of $A$.

**This is not a new notion, and that is the point of writing it down.** Since
$\lVert f(x)-f(a)\rVert_2 = d_2\bigl(f(x),f(a)\bigr)$ and $d_A$ is the
restriction of $d_X$, the displayed condition is **verbatim** the condition of
[[def-metric-continuity]] for the map of metric spaces
$f : (A,d_A) \to (\mathbb{R}^{m}, d_2)$. So every theorem about continuous maps
of metric spaces applies to vector-valued functions with no translation, and
this library has exactly one notion of continuity here. The same move was made
once before, between the $\mathbb{R}$-native and the metric notions, in
[[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]]; this item is that move one dimension up in
the codomain.

The two cases used below are $X = \mathbb{R}$ with $d_{\mathbb{R}}(s,t) = |s-t|$
([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]) and $X = \mathbb{R}^{n}$ with $d_2$, for
$n \ge 1$.

### Limits, for a real domain

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$, let $c$ be a limit
point of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]) and let $L \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$. We say
$f(x)$ **tends to $L$ as $x$ tends to $c$**, and write
$\lim_{x\to c} f(x) = L$, when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ 0 < |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ \lVert f(x) - L\rVert_2 < \varepsilon\ \bigr].$$

This is the condition of [[def-function-limit]] with the absolute value in the
codomain replaced by $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$; as there, the puncture $0 < |x-c|$ is
what makes $c$ a point the function need not be defined at, and the hypothesis
that $c$ is a limit point of $A$ is what stops the condition from being satisfied
vacuously.

**The notation denotes: at most one $L$ satisfies the condition.** Suppose $L$
and $L'$ both do and $L \ne L'$. Then $\varepsilon := \lVert L-L'\rVert_2 / 2 > 0$
by (N1) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]). Take $\delta$
and $\delta'$ for this $\varepsilon$ and put $\eta := \min\{\delta,\delta'\} > 0$.
Since $c$ is a limit point of $A$ there is $x \in A$ with $0 < |x-c| < \eta$
([[def-limit-point-r]]), and then

$$\lVert L - L'\rVert_2 \;\le\; \lVert L - f(x)\rVert_2 + \lVert f(x) - L'\rVert_2 \;<\; \varepsilon + \varepsilon \;=\; \lVert L-L'\rVert_2$$

by (N3) and (N2), which trichotomy forbids. So $L = L'$.

### Components

For $i < m$ define the $i$-th **coordinate projection**
$\pi_i : \mathbb{R}^{m} \to \mathbb{R}$ by $\pi_i(y) := y_i = y(i)$, and for
$f : A \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$ the $i$-th **component** $f_i := \pi_i \circ f$, a
real-valued function on $A$.

**Each $\pi_i$ is $1$-Lipschitz** ([[def-lipschitz-holder-contraction]]): for
$y, z \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$,

$$\bigl|\pi_i(y) - \pi_i(z)\bigr| \;=\; |y_i - z_i| \;\le\; \lVert y - z\rVert_2 \;=\; d_2(y,z),$$

the middle inequality being $|w_i| \le \lVert w\rVert_2$ at $w := y-z$
([[lem-every-norm-on-rn-is-continuous-for-the-euclidean-metric]] clause 3, or
directly because $w_i^{2}$ is one term of the sum $\sum_{k<m}w_k^{2}$). Written
in coordinates, $f(x)$ is the vector whose $i$-th coordinate is $f_i(x)$, and
$f(x) = \sum_{i<m} f_i(x)\,e_i$ in the standard basis
([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]]).

## Remarks

- **The codomain $\mathbb{R}^{0}$ is excluded by the standing hypothesis
  $m \ge 1$, and nothing is lost.** $\mathbb{R}^{0}$ has exactly one element, so
  every function into it is constant and every ball condition holds trivially;
  every such map is continuous and every limit is the unique point. That case is
  true, uninteresting, and not what this page is about. It is also outside the
  reach of [[lem-metrics-on-rn]], which defines the metrics only for $m \ge 1$.

- **The domain may be any metric space, and this matters twice below.** The
  derivative of [[def-vector-valued-derivative-and-integral]] needs a real
  domain, so it uses the limit clause; the companion page's function of two real
  variables needs the domain $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, so it uses the continuity clause.
  Both are instances of the same definition, and neither introduces a second
  notion.

- **When $m = 1$ the codomain is $\mathbb{R}^{1}$, not $\mathbb{R}$.** These are
  different sets, $\mathbb{R}^{1}$ being a set of functions $1 \to \mathbb{R}$.
  The map $\theta : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^{1}$ sending $t$ to the function
  with value $t$ at $0$ is an isometric bijection for $d_2$
  ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]), and under it the notions above become
  those of [[def-continuity-real]] and [[def-function-limit]]. Every comparison
  on this page between the vector-valued theory and the one-dimensional theory
  goes through that identification, stated explicitly each time.

- **Convergence of sequences in $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ is not redefined here.** It is
  [[def-metric-convergence]] for $(\mathbb{R}^{m},d_2)$, with balls as in
  [[def-metric-ball]], and its componentwise characterisation is
  [[thm-componentwise-convergence-and-completeness]].
