## Definition

Let $X$ be a set and, for each $k \in \mathbb{N}$, let
$f_k : X \to \mathbb{R}$ be a real-valued function
([[def-function-space]]). Let $f : X \to \mathbb{R}$.

The sequence $(f_k)$ **converges pointwise** to $f$ on $X$ when, for every
$x \in X$, the real sequence $(f_k(x))$ converges to $f(x)$
([[def-real-limit]]). Thus the index after which
$|f_k(x)-f(x)|<\varepsilon$ may depend on both $\varepsilon$ and $x$.

The sequence $(f_k)$ **converges uniformly** to $f$ on $X$ when

$$(\forall \varepsilon>0)(\exists N\in\mathbb{N})(\forall k\ge N)(\forall x\in X)\quad |f_k(x)-f(x)|<\varepsilon,$$

where $\varepsilon$ ranges over the positive reals. Here one index $N$ serves
every point of $X$.

The sequence $(f_k)$ is **uniformly Cauchy** on $X$ when

$$(\forall \varepsilon>0)(\exists N\in\mathbb{N})(\forall m,n\ge N)(\forall x\in X)\quad |f_m(x)-f_n(x)|<\varepsilon.$$

For each of the three notions above, restricting the error to positive
rationals gives an equivalent condition. The real-error condition immediately
implies the rational-error condition. Conversely, given a real $\eta>0$,
choose $n\ge1$ with $1/n<\eta$ by
[[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]]; the condition for the positive rational
$1/n$ implies the condition for $\eta$. The real-error form is used because
it makes the uniform quantifiers transparent.
