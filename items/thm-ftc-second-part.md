## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals, let $G : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be differentiable at every
point of $[a,b]$ as a function on $[a,b]$ ([[def-derivative]]; at $a$ and $b$
this is the one-sided derivative), let $f := G'$, and suppose $f$ is integrable
on $[a,b]$ ([[def-darboux-integral]]). Then

$$\int_a^b f \;=\; G(b) - G(a) .$$

**Both hypotheses are needed and neither is removable.** A function may be
differentiable everywhere with $G'$ not integrable — then the left-hand side does
not exist (an everywhere differentiable function with unbounded derivative) — and an
integrable $f$ need not be the derivative of anything
(the sign function); both witnesses are on the
companion page.

**No continuity of $f$ is assumed**, which is what makes this the working form:
the theorem evaluates $\int_a^b f$ for every integrable derivative, not only for
continuous integrands.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, a function $G : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ differentiable at every point of $[a,b]$, $f := G'$ integrable on $[a,b]$, and a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[a,b]$.

[L1] For a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[a,b]$: $t_0 = a$, $t_n = b$, $t_i < t_{i+1}$ for $i < n$, $\Delta_i = t_{i+1}-t_i > 0$, and $I_i = [t_i,t_{i+1}] \subseteq [a,b]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-interval]]).

[L2] $L(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}m_i\Delta_i$ and $U(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}M_i\Delta_i$ with $m_i = \inf f[I_i]$ and $M_i = \sup f[I_i]$, so $m_i \le f(\xi) \le M_i$ for every $\xi \in I_i$ ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L3] $\underline{\int_a^b} f = \sup_P L(f,P)$ and $\overline{\int_a^b} f = \inf_P U(f,P)$, and $f$ integrable means the two agree, their common value being $\int_a^b f$ ([[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L4] Mean value theorem: if $u$ is continuous on $[p,q]$ with $p<q$ and differentiable at every point of $(p,q)$, there is $\xi \in (p,q)$ with $u(q)-u(p) = u'(\xi)(q-p)$ ([[cor-mean-value-theorem]]).

[L5] A function differentiable at a point is continuous there, and the restriction of a differentiable function to a subinterval is differentiable with the same derivative at every point of that subinterval which is a limit point of it ([[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]], [[def-derivative]], [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L6] Finite sums: telescoping $\sum_{i<n}(c_{i+1}-c_i) = c_n - c_0$, and monotonicity in the terms ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], clauses 4 and 5).

[L7] Ordered-field arithmetic: multiplying an inequality by a positive real preserves it, the order is total and transitive, and a number that is an upper bound of a set and also a lower bound of another set lies between their supremum and infimum ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $P = (n,t)$ be an arbitrary partition of $[a,b]$ and let $i < n$. The restriction of $G$ to $I_i = [t_i,t_{i+1}]$ is continuous on $I_i$ and differentiable at every point of $(t_i,t_{i+1})$, with the same derivative $f$ there, by [L5] and [L1]. [given, L1, L5]

2.1 By [L4] applied on $I_i$ there is $\xi_i \in (t_i,t_{i+1})$ with $G(t_{i+1}) - G(t_i) = f(\xi_i)\,\Delta_i$; since $\xi_i \in I_i$ and $\Delta_i > 0$, [L2] gives $m_i\Delta_i \le G(t_{i+1})-G(t_i) \le M_i\Delta_i$. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L4, L7]

3.1 Step 2.1 holds for every $i < n$, so monotonicity of finite sums applies to the three families and gives $\sum_{i<n}m_i\Delta_i \le \sum_{i<n}\bigl(G(t_{i+1})-G(t_i)\bigr) \le \sum_{i<n}M_i\Delta_i$. [step 2.1, L6]

4.1 The middle sum telescopes to $G(t_n) - G(t_0) = G(b) - G(a)$ by [L6] and [L1], so $L(f,P) \le G(b)-G(a) \le U(f,P)$ by [L2]. [step 3.1, L1, L2, L6]

5.1 Step 4.1 holds for **every** partition $P$, so $G(b)-G(a)$ is an upper bound of the set of lower sums and a lower bound of the set of upper sums; hence $\underline{\int_a^b} f \le G(b)-G(a) \le \overline{\int_a^b} f$ by [L3] and [L7]. [step 4.1, L3, L7]

6.1 Since $f$ is integrable the two integrals coincide with $\int_a^b f$, so $\int_a^b f = G(b)-G(a)$. [step 5.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **No choice principle is spent, and no sequence of tags is ever formed.** The usual proof selects one $\xi_i$ per subinterval and assembles the Riemann sum $\sum_i f(\xi_i)\Delta_i$, which is a choice from finitely many nonempty sets. The proof above never forms that family: step 2.1 proves, for an arbitrary fixed $i$, the *inequality* $m_i\Delta_i \le G(t_{i+1})-G(t_i) \le M_i\Delta_i$, which is a universally quantified statement about $i$ and needs no selection, and step 3.1 then sums the inequality. The telescoping identity supplies the middle term without any tags at all.

- **The hypothesis is differentiability at every point of the closed interval.** It is not enough to be differentiable on $(a,b)$ and continuous on $[a,b]$ in the argument as written, because step 2.1 uses the derivative only on open subintervals but the definition $f = G'$ has to name a function on all of $[a,b]$ for $\int_a^b f$ to mean anything. Changing $f$ at the two endpoints changes neither its integrability nor its integral ([[lem-changing-a-function-at-finitely-many-points]]), so the reader who prefers the weaker hypothesis loses nothing.

- **This is the half of the fundamental theorem that computes.** The other half, [[thm-ftc-first-part]], produces a primitive; this one evaluates an integral once a primitive is known, and it is the tool the companion page reaches for whenever a primitive is available. Where no primitive is at hand the companion page computes instead by splitting at a jump and using the integral of a constant; no claim is made here about how many of its computations take which route.

- **Forward references, orientation only.** The two witnesses showing neither hypothesis is removable are [[cex-a-function-with-a-primitive-that-is-not-integrable]] and [[cex-an-integrable-function-with-no-primitive]] on the companion page; nothing above depends on either.
