## Statement

For every real $x$,
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(1+\frac{x}{\iota(n)}\right)^n=\exp(x),$$
with the sequence started after $n>|x|$, so the base is positive.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real $x$.

[L1] The binomial theorem expands the product. For fixed $k$, [[lem-scaled-binomial-coefficients-converge]] gives both convergence of the scaled coefficient to $1/\iota(k!)$ and, whenever $n\ge\max\{1,k\}$, the bound $0\le\iota\binom nk/\iota(n)^k\le1/\iota(k!)$ ([[thm-binomial-theorem]]).

[L2] The exponential series converges absolutely ([[lem-exponential-series-has-infinite-radius]], [[def-real-exponential-function-and-e]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For $n>|x|$, the binomial theorem gives $(1+x/\iota(n))^n=\sum_{k=0}^{n}\bigl(\iota\binom nk/\iota(n)^k\bigr)x^k$.  [L1]

1.2 Each fixed coefficient tends to $1/\iota(k!)$, while the uniform bound in [L1] holds for every term present in the sum.  [L1]

2.1 Given $\varepsilon>0$, choose $K$ so the absolute exponential tail after $K$ is below $\varepsilon/3$ using [L2]. The same coefficient bound controls the product tail uniformly in $n$; for the finite head $k\le K$, choose $n$ so all coefficient errors sum to below $\varepsilon/3$.  [step 1.2, L2, choose]

3.1 The triangle inequality then makes the product differ from $\sum_{k\ge0}x^k/\iota(k!)=\exp(x)$ by less than $\varepsilon$.   [step 1.1, step 2.1, given] ∎
