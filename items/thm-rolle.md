## Statement

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be
continuous on $[a,b]$ ([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-interval]]) and
differentiable at every point of $(a,b)$ as a function on $[a,b]$
([[def-derivative]]), and suppose

$$f(a) \;=\; f(b) .$$

Then there is $c \in (a,b)$ with $f'(c) = 0$.

**Three hypotheses, three different jobs.** Continuity on the **closed**
interval is what the extreme value theorem consumes; differentiability on the
**open** interval is what Fermat's theorem consumes, and it is asked for
nowhere else; and $f(a) = f(b)$ is what forces the extremum inside when neither
extremum is attained in the interior. Continuity at the two endpoints cannot be
dropped, and a false statement later on this page records a witness for that.

**Differentiability is meant with respect to the domain $[a,b]$.** For $c$ in
the open interval that is the same condition as differentiability of any
restriction of $f$ to a subinterval around $c$, since only points near $c$
enter, but the phrase is fixed here so that the citation of
[[thm-fermat-interior-extremum]], whose hypothesis is interiority in the
domain, is exact.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, a function $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable at every point of $(a,b)$, with $f(a) = f(b)$.

[L1] $[a,b]$ is closed ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) and bounded ([[def-interval]], [[def-bounded-set]]), hence compact ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]]); and it is nonempty, since $a \le a \le b$ gives $a \in [a,b]$.

[L2] Extreme value theorem ([[thm-extreme-value-r]]): for $f$ continuous on $A$ and $K \subseteq A$ nonempty and compact there are $p, q \in K$ with $f(q) \le f(x) \le f(p)$ for every $x \in K$, so that $f(p) = \max f[K]$ and $f(q) = \min f[K]$ ([[def-max-min]]).

[L3] Every point of $(a,b)$ is interior to $[a,b]$: for $c$ with $a < c < b$ put $\varepsilon := \min\{c - a,\ b - c\}$, a positive real; every $y$ with $|y - c| < \varepsilon$ satisfies $y > c - \varepsilon \ge a$ and $y < c + \varepsilon \le b$, so $N_{\varepsilon}(c) \subseteq (a,b) \subseteq [a,b]$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-interval]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]).

[L4] A value $f(c)$ that is a greatest value of $f$ over the whole of its domain is a local maximum at $c$, and a least value is a local minimum at $c$ ([[def-local-extremum]], claim 4 of its body).

[L5] Fermat's interior extremum theorem ([[thm-fermat-interior-extremum]]): a local extremum at a point interior to the domain, at which the function is differentiable, forces the derivative there to vanish.

[L6] $(a,b)$ is nonempty when $a < b$, since $a < (a+b)/2 < b$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L7] A constant function $h$ on $[a,b]$ is differentiable at every point $c$ of $[a,b]$ with $h'(c) = 0$: every point of the nondegenerate order-convex set $[a,b]$ is a limit point of it, and the difference quotient of $h$ at $c$ is the constant $0$ on $[a,b] \setminus \{c\}$, whose limit at $c$ is $0$ ([[def-derivative]], [[def-function-limit]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The set $[a,b]$ is nonempty and compact, and $f$ is continuous on it. [L1]

1.2 Since $a < b$, the open interval $(a,b)$ is nonempty; fix $m := (a+b)/2 \in (a,b)$. [L6, choose]

2.1 By [L2], applied with $A := K := [a,b]$, fix $p, q \in [a,b]$ with $f(q) \le f(x) \le f(p)$ for every $x \in [a,b]$. [step 1.1, L2, choose]

3.1 **Case A: at least one of $p, q$ lies in $(a,b)$.** Fix such a point and call it $c$. By [L3] the point $c$ is interior to $[a,b]$, and $f$ is differentiable at $c$ because $c \in (a,b)$. By step 2.1 and [L4], $f$ has a local maximum at $c$ if $c$ is the point $p$, and a local minimum at $c$ if it is the point $q$; either way a local extremum. So [L5] gives $f'(c) = 0$, and $c \in (a,b)$. [step 2.1, L3, L4, L5]

3.2 **Case B: neither $p$ nor $q$ lies in $(a,b)$.** A point of $[a,b]$ outside $(a,b)$ satisfies $a \le x \le b$ and not $a < x < b$, hence equals $a$ or $b$; so $p, q \in \{a, b\}$ and, since $f(a) = f(b)$, both $f(p)$ and $f(q)$ equal $f(a)$. By step 2.1, every $x \in [a,b]$ satisfies $f(a) = f(q) \le f(x) \le f(p) = f(a)$, so $f(x) = f(a)$. Thus $f$ is the constant function with value $f(a)$ on $[a,b]$. [step 2.1]

4.1 In case B, [L7] gives that $f$ is differentiable at every point of $[a,b]$ with derivative $0$; in particular $f'(m) = 0$, and $m \in (a,b)$ by step 1.2. [step 1.2, step 3.2, L7]

5.1 The two cases are exhaustive, since either at least one of $p, q$ lies in $(a,b)$ or neither does. Case A supplies a point $c \in (a,b)$ with $f'(c) = 0$ by step 3.1, and case B supplies the point $m$ by step 4.1. [step 3.1, step 4.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The constant case is not a degenerate nuisance, it is the case where the extremum sits on the boundary.** When $f$ is constant the greatest and least values are attained at the endpoints as well as everywhere else, so nothing forces the extreme value theorem to hand back an interior point; the argument has to produce a point of $(a,b)$ by hand, and any point will do.

- **Why compactness enters at all.** Only through [[thm-extreme-value-r]], and only to know that the greatest and least values are **attained**. A supremum that is not attained is useless here: Fermat's theorem is a statement about a point, not about a bound. That is precisely the hypothesis the companion page's witness removes.

- **Nothing is claimed about how many such $c$ there are, or where.** A single $c$ is produced, and the proof gives no way to locate it; the theorem is an existence statement and is used only as one.
