## Definition

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, so that $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ carries the
Euclidean metric $d_2$ ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]],
[[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]]). A **sequence of
vectors** is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}^{n}$, written $(x_k)$ with
$x_k := x(k)$; as everywhere in this library $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$ and a
sequence is indexed from $0$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-metric-convergence]]).

### Partial sums and convergence

The **partial sums** of $(x_k)$ are

$$s_N \;:=\; \sum_{k<N} x_k \;\in\; \mathbb{R}^{n} \qquad (N \in \mathbb{N}),$$

the finite sum of the vector space $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
([[def-linear-combination-and-span]]), so $s_0 = 0$ and $s_{N+1} = s_N + x_N$.
**No third notion of finite sum is introduced**: by
[[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]] clause 1 the vector sum is computed pointwise,
$(s_N)(j) = \sum_{k<N} x_k(j)$ for $j<n$, the right-hand side being the real
finite sum of [[def-finite-sum]].

The **series** $\sum x_k$ **converges to $s \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$** when
$s_N \to s$ in $(\mathbb{R}^{n}, d_2)$ ([[def-metric-convergence]]), and then $s$
is **the sum**, written $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}x_k$. The symbol denotes a single
vector, because a sequence in a metric space has at most one limit
([[lem-metric-limits-unique]]). The series **diverges** when $(s_N)$ does not
converge.

### Absolute convergence

$\sum x_k$ **converges absolutely** when the real series
$\sum \lVert x_k\rVert_2$ converges ([[def-series]]); since
$\lVert x_k\rVert_2 \ge 0$ ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]), this is a statement
about a series of nonnegative terms, exactly as in
[[def-absolute-and-conditional-convergence]].

**The choice of norm is immaterial.** If $N$ is any norm on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ then
$c\lVert x_k\rVert_2 \le N(x_k) \le C\lVert x_k\rVert_2$ for fixed $c, C > 0$
([[thm-all-norms-on-rn-are-equivalent]], [[def-equivalent-norms]]), so
$\sum N(x_k)$ converges exactly when $\sum\lVert x_k\rVert_2$ does, both being
series of nonnegative terms. The notion defined above therefore depends on
$\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and not on the norm chosen to test it.

### Rearrangement and the set of rearrangement sums

Let $\sigma : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ be a bijection
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]). The **rearrangement of $\sum x_k$ along
$\sigma$** is the series $\sum x_{\sigma(k)}$ of the sequence
$k \mapsto x_{\sigma(k)}$, verbatim as in
[[def-rearrangement-and-unconditional-convergence]] one dimension down. The
**set of rearrangement sums** of $(x_k)$ is

$$\mathcal{S}(x) \;:=\; \Bigl\{\, s \in \mathbb{R}^{n} \;:\; \text{some rearrangement of } \sum x_k \text{ converges to } s \,\Bigr\}.$$

Taking $\sigma$ to be the identity shows that a convergent $\sum x_k$ has its own
sum in $\mathcal{S}(x)$, so $\mathcal{S}(x) \ne \varnothing$ for a convergent
series.

### Agreement with the one-dimensional theory

$\mathbb{R}^{1}$ is the set of functions $1 \to \mathbb{R}$ and is **not
literally** $\mathbb{R}$. The map $\theta : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^{1}$ sending
$t$ to the function with value $t$ at $0$ is a bijection; it preserves addition
and scalar multiplication, since both are computed pointwise
([[def-vector-space]], [[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]]), and
$d_2(\theta(s),\theta(t)) = |s-t|$, so it is an isometric bijection
([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]). Under that identification, and for
$n = 1$:

- the partial sums above are the partial sums of [[def-series]];
- convergence and the sum are those of [[def-series]];
- absolute convergence is that of [[def-absolute-and-conditional-convergence]],
  since $\lVert\theta(t)\rVert_2 = |t|$;
- rearrangement is that of [[def-rearrangement-and-unconditional-convergence]];
- $\mathcal{S}(x)$ is the image under $\theta$ of the set of rearrangement sums
  that the published remark [[rem-rearrangement-in-higher-dimensions]] writes
  $\mathcal{S}(a)$.

**Every comparison on this page between $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and the published
one-dimensional theory goes through this identification, and it is stated each
time.**

## Remarks

- **Where $n \ge 1$ comes from.** Convergence is tested with $d_2$, and
  [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] defines the metrics on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ only for
  $n \ge 1$. The algebra above — partial sums, rearrangement, the set
  $\mathcal{S}(x)$ as a set of vectors — makes sense at $n = 0$ as well, but
  nothing on this page is asserted there.

- **Convergence is componentwise.** By
  [[thm-componentwise-convergence-and-completeness]] clause 1 and the pointwise
  formula for partial sums, $\sum x_k$ converges to $s$ if and only if the $n$
  real series $\sum (x_k)_j$ converge, with sums $s_j$. That is the form every
  proof below uses, and it is what reduces the vector theory to the published
  scalar theory rather than duplicating it.

- **Unconditional convergence is not defined here.** The one-dimensional notion is
  [[def-rearrangement-and-unconditional-convergence]], and over $\mathbb{R}$ it
  coincides with absolute convergence ([[cor-unconditional-iff-absolute-in-r]]).
  Whether that coincidence survives to $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n \ge 2$ is not
  settled anywhere on this page, and nothing here asserts it in either direction.
  What **is** proved is that absolute convergence implies convergence of every
  rearrangement to the same sum ([[thm-absolute-convergence-in-rn]]).
