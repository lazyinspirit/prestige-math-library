## Statement

Let $(\varepsilon_k)$ be the alternating sequence of [[lem-alternating-sequence]],
that is the unique sequence of reals with $\varepsilon_0 = 1$ and
$\varepsilon_{k+1} = -\varepsilon_k$, which is what is usually written
$\varepsilon_k = (-1)^k$; let $e$ and $o$ be its even and odd index maps, so that
$\varepsilon_{e_j} = 1$, $\varepsilon_{o_j} = -1$, and every natural number is
$e_j$ for exactly one $j$ or $o_j$ for exactly one $j$.

Let $(b_k)$ be a sequence of reals that is nonincreasing
([[def-monotone-sequence]]) and converges to $0$ ([[def-real-limit]]); then
$b_k \ge 0$ for every $k$. Write $t_n := \sum_{k<n} \varepsilon_k b_k$ for the
partial sums ([[def-series]]). Then:

1. the series $\sum \varepsilon_k b_k$ converges; write $L$ for its sum;
2. $t_{e_j} \le L \le t_{o_j}$ for every $j \in \mathbb{N}$, and for every
   $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the sum $L$ lies between the two consecutive partial sums
   $t_n$ and $t_{n+1}$;
3. $|L - t_n| \le b_n$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

Claim 3 is the error bound: the partial sum $t_n$, which uses the $n$ terms
$\varepsilon_0 b_0, \dots, \varepsilon_{n-1}b_{n-1}$, differs from the sum by at
most the first term omitted.

**Only claim 1 is a corollary of [[thm-dirichlet-test]].** Claims 2 and 3 are not:
they come from the interlacing of the even-index and odd-index partial sums, and
that argument is carried out below rather than smuggled into the Dirichlet
estimate, which produces no bracketing at all.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A nonincreasing sequence $(b_k)$ of reals with $b_k \to 0$, the alternating sequence $(\varepsilon_k)$ with its index maps $e$ and $o$, and the partial sums $t_n = \sum_{k<n} \varepsilon_k b_k$.

[L1] The alternating sequence and its index maps: $\varepsilon_0 = 1$, $\varepsilon_{k+1} = -\varepsilon_k$, $|\varepsilon_k| = 1$; $e_0 = 0$ and $e_{j+1} = e_j + 2$; $o_0 = 1$ and $o_{j+1} = o_j + 2$; both $e$ and $o$ are strictly increasing; $\mathbb{N}$ is the disjoint union of their ranges; $\varepsilon_{e_j} = 1$ and $\varepsilon_{o_j} = -1$ ([[lem-alternating-sequence]]).

[L2] Nonincreasing means $b_j \ge b_k$ whenever $j \le k$ ([[def-monotone-sequence]]).

[L3] Limits preserve non-strict inequalities holding eventually ([[lem-limit-preserves-order]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L4] Dirichlet's test: if the partial sums of $\sum x_k$ are bounded and $(y_k)$ is nonincreasing with $y_k \to 0$, then $\sum x_k y_k$ converges ([[thm-dirichlet-test]]).

[L5] A subsequence of a convergent sequence converges to the same limit ([[lem-subsequence-inherits-limit]]).

[L6] Partial sums satisfy $t_0 = 0$ and $t_{n+1} = t_n + \varepsilon_n b_n$ ([[def-series]]).

[L7] The principle of induction on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L8] Absolute value: $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$ and $|x| \ge 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For each fixed $k$ the inequality $b_m \le b_k$ holds for all $m \ge k$, and $(b_m)_m$ converges to $0$ while the constant sequence with value $b_k$ converges to $b_k$; hence $b_k \ge 0$. [given, L2, L3]

1.2 Writing $A_n = \sum_{k<n}\varepsilon_k$, an induction gives that for every $n$ either $A_n = 0$ and $\varepsilon_n = 1$, or $A_n = 1$ and $\varepsilon_n = -1$: at $n = 0$ we have $A_0 = 0$ and $\varepsilon_0 = 1$; and if $A_n = 0$ and $\varepsilon_n = 1$ then $A_{n+1} = 1$ and $\varepsilon_{n+1} = -1$, while if $A_n = 1$ and $\varepsilon_n = -1$ then $A_{n+1} = 0$ and $\varepsilon_{n+1} = 1$. In particular $|A_n| \le 1$ for every $n$. [L1, L6, L7]

1.3 For every $j$ one has $o_j = e_j + 1$ and $e_{j+1} = o_j + 1$, by induction: $o_0 = 1 = e_0 + 1$; and if $o_j = e_j + 1$ then $e_{j+1} = e_j + 2 = o_j + 1$ and $o_{j+1} = o_j + 2 = e_{j+1} + 1$. [L1, L7]

1.4 By [L6], $t_{n+1} - t_n = \varepsilon_n b_n$ for every $n$; hence $t_{e_j + 1} = t_{e_j} + b_{e_j}$ and $t_{o_j + 1} = t_{o_j} - b_{o_j}$. [L1, L6]

2.1 The partial sums of $\sum \varepsilon_k$ are bounded by step 1.2 and $(b_k)$ is nonincreasing with limit $0$, so $\sum \varepsilon_k b_k$ converges by Dirichlet's test; write $L$ for its sum, so that $t_n \to L$. [step 1.2, given, L4]

2.2 Using step 1.3, $t_{o_j} = t_{e_j + 1} = t_{e_j} + b_{e_j}$ and $t_{e_{j+1}} = t_{o_j + 1} = t_{o_j} - b_{o_j}$, so $t_{e_{j+1}} = t_{e_j} + b_{e_j} - b_{o_j}$ and $t_{o_{j+1}} = t_{e_{j+1}} + b_{e_{j+1}} = t_{o_j} - b_{o_j} + b_{e_{j+1}}$. [step 1.3, step 1.4]

3.1 Since $e_j < o_j < e_{j+1}$ and $(b_k)$ is nonincreasing, $b_{e_j} - b_{o_j} \ge 0$ and $b_{e_{j+1}} - b_{o_j} \le 0$; so by step 2.2 the sequence $(t_{e_j})_j$ is nondecreasing and the sequence $(t_{o_j})_j$ is nonincreasing. [step 1.3, step 2.2, L2]

3.2 The maps $e$ and $o$ are strictly increasing, so $(t_{e_j})_j$ and $(t_{o_j})_j$ are subsequences of $(t_n)$ and both converge to $L$. [step 2.1, L1, L5]

4.1 Fix $j$. For every $m \ge j$ one has $t_{e_j} \le t_{e_m}$, and $(t_{e_m})_m$ converges to $L$, so $t_{e_j} \le L$; symmetrically $t_{o_j} \ge L$. This is the first half of claim 2. [step 3.1, step 3.2, L3]

5.1 Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. If $n = e_j$ then $t_n = t_{e_j} \le L$ and $t_{n+1} = t_{e_j+1} = t_{o_j} \ge L$; if $n = o_j$ then $t_n = t_{o_j} \ge L$ and $t_{n+1} = t_{o_j+1} = t_{e_{j+1}} \le L$. Since every $n$ is of exactly one of these two forms, $L$ always lies between $t_n$ and $t_{n+1}$, which is the second half of claim 2. [step 1.3, step 4.1, L1]

6.1 Consequently $|L - t_n| \le |t_{n+1} - t_n| = |\varepsilon_n b_n| = |\varepsilon_n|\,b_n = b_n$ for every $n$, using $b_n \ge 0$ and $|\varepsilon_n| = 1$; this is claim 3. [step 5.1, step 1.4, step 1.1, L1, L8] ∎

## Remarks

- **The two hypotheses are not interchangeable with "$b_k \to 0$" alone.** A null sequence that is not monotone can make $\sum \varepsilon_k b_k$ diverge, and the bracketing of step 3.1 is exactly where monotonicity enters; the error bound is false without it. The test as stated is the classical Leibniz criterion.

- **Why the index maps rather than "$2j$" and "$2j+1$".** The even and odd index maps come from [[lem-alternating-sequence]] together with the parity object itself, and step 1.3 is the only arithmetic needed about them. Rebuilding $(-1)^k$ by a fresh recursion inside this proof, and then proving afresh that the even indices and the odd indices partition $\mathbb{N}$, is precisely what that lemma exists to prevent.

- **What the test does not give.** It produces the sum $L$ as a limit and bounds the error, and it identifies $L$ with no closed expression. For the alternating harmonic series the value is not available at this point in the reading order; see [[rem-sums-proved-to-exist-but-not-evaluated]].
