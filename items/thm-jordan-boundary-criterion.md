## Statement

A metric-bounded set $E\subseteq\mathbb R^m$ is Jordan measurable if and only
if its boundary $\partial E$ is null, equivalently has content zero.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Metric-bounded $E$ in the sense of [[def-metric-bounded-diameter]].

[L1] The indicator $1_E$ is discontinuous exactly at $\partial E$ ([[def-metric-interior-closure-boundary]]).

[L2] Indicator integrability is Jordan measurability ([[thm-jordan-content-and-indicator-integrability]]), and integrability is equivalent to a null discontinuity set ([[thm-lebesgue-criterion-in-rn]]).

[L3] The boundary is closed: it is the intersection of the closed set $\overline E$ with the complement of the open set $\operatorname{int}E$ ([[def-metric-interior-closure-boundary]], [[thm-metric-closure-characterisation]], [[def-metric-topology]]). By [[def-jordan-inner-and-outer-content]], metric boundedness places $E$ in a closed bounding rectangle $Q$. Since $Q$ is closed and contains $E$, the smallest-closed-superset property gives $\partial E\subseteq\overline E\subseteq Q$. Thus $\partial E$ is closed and bounded, hence compact by [[thm-heine-borel-rn]], and compact nullity is equivalent to content zero ([[lem-compact-null-iff-content-zero-in-rn]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L1] and [L2], $E$ is Jordan measurable exactly when $\partial E$ is null.  [L1, L2]

1.2 By [L3], nullity of this compact boundary is equivalent to content zero.   [L3, given]

2.1 Combining the equivalences proves the criterion.   [step 1.1, step 1.2, given] ∎
