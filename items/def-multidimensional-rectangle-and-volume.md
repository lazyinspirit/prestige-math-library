## Definition

Fix a natural number $m\ge1$. For $a,b\in\mathbb R^m$ with $a_j\le b_j$ for $j<m$, define
$$[a,b]:=\{x\in\mathbb R^m:a_j\le x_j\le b_j\ (j<m)\},\qquad \operatorname{vol}[a,b]:=\prod_{j<m}(b_j-a_j).$$
The product is the recursively defined finite product of [[def-finite-sum]]. The rectangle is **nondegenerate** when every $a_j<b_j$, and it is a **cube** when all side lengths are equal.

Every factor is nonnegative, so volume is nonnegative. For a coordinate index $r<m$, cutting at $c\in[a_r,b_r]$ gives two rectangles whose volumes add to the original, by distributivity in that factor and [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]. Under the standard identification $\mathbb R^1\cong\mathbb R$ ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]], [[def-p-norms-on-rn]]), this is the interval $[a_0,b_0]$ and its length.
