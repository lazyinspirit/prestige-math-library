## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in
\mathbb{R}$. Put

$$A^{-} := A \cap (-\infty, c), \qquad A^{+} := A \cap (c, \infty)$$

([[def-interval]]), and write $f^{-} := f|_{A^{-}}$ and $f^{+} := f|_{A^{+}}$
for the restrictions of $f$ to those sets.

**Right limit.** Suppose $c$ is a limit point of $A^{+}$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]).
For $L \in \mathbb{R}$ we write

$$\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x) = L \quad :\Longleftrightarrow \quad \lim_{x \to c} f^{+}(x) = L$$

in the sense of [[def-function-limit]]. Written out: for every real
$\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that

$$|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon \qquad \text{for every } x \in A \text{ with } c < x < c + \delta .$$

**Left limit.** Suppose $c$ is a limit point of $A^{-}$. For $L \in \mathbb{R}$
we write $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) = L$ when $\lim_{x \to c} f^{-}(x) = L$; written
out, for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ with
$|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ for every $x \in A$ with $c - \delta < x < c$.

**The written-out forms agree with the definitions.** For $x \in A^{+}$ the two
conditions $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ and $c < x < c + \delta$ are the same: $x > c$
gives $x - c > 0$, so $|x - c| = x - c$ and $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ reads
$0 < x - c < \delta$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]). Symmetrically on the left, where
$x < c$ gives $|x - c| = c - x$.

**Well-posedness is inherited, not reproved.** A one-sided limit *is* a limit,
namely the limit of a restriction, so:

- **Uniqueness.** At most one $L$ can occur, by [[lem-function-limit-unique]]
  applied to $f^{+}$ on the domain $A^{+}$ (respectively to $f^{-}$ on
  $A^{-}$), which is legitimate exactly because $c$ was required to be a limit
  point of that set. This is what makes the notation $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$
  denote a single real.
- **Locality and restriction.** Both claims of [[lem-limit-is-local]] apply
  verbatim to $f^{+}$ and $f^{-}$.

**When the symbols are defined.** If $c$ is not a limit point of $A^{+}$ — for
instance if $A$ contains no point to the right of $c$, or only points bounded
away from $c$ on that side — then $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$ is **not defined**
here, for the reason given in [[def-function-limit]]: the
$\varepsilon$-$\delta$ condition would be satisfied vacuously by every real at
once. The same applies on the left.

## Remarks

- **Neither one-sided limit requires $c \in A$, and neither looks at $f(c)$.**
  Both properties are inherited from [[def-function-limit]], since $c \notin
  A^{-} \cup A^{+}$: the point $c$ belongs to neither $(-\infty, c)$ nor
  $(c, \infty)$.

- **The two one-sided limits and the two-sided limit.** When $c$ is a limit
  point of both $A^{-}$ and $A^{+}$, the two-sided limit exists exactly when
  both one-sided limits exist and agree, and then all three coincide:
  [[thm-two-sided-limit-iff-both-one-sided]]. When $c$ is a limit point of only
  one of the two sets, that one-sided limit and the two-sided limit are the same
  condition, again by claim 2 of [[lem-limit-is-local]] together with the
  observation that $A$ and that one side have the same points in a small enough
  punctured neighbourhood of $c$.

- **Notation.** Some texts write $f(c+)$ and $f(c-)$ for these values. This
  library writes only $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$ and $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x)$,
  because the shorter notation looks like an evaluation of $f$ and these
  quantities are not values of $f$: they are defined without reference to
  $f(c)$, which may not even exist.
