## Definition

Let $\kappa$ and $\lambda$ be cardinals ([[def-cardinal]]), and recall the
notation of [[lem-cardinal-operations-are-well-defined]]:

$$\kappa \sqcup \lambda = (\{0\} \times \kappa) \cup (\{1\} \times \lambda), \qquad {}^{\lambda}\kappa = \{\, h : h \text{ is a function } \lambda \to \kappa \,\}.$$

**Sum and product.**

$$\kappa \oplus \lambda \;:=\; \lvert \kappa \sqcup \lambda \rvert, \qquad \kappa \otimes \lambda \;:=\; \lvert \kappa \times \lambda \rvert .$$

Both values exist in ZF and are cardinals: claim (c) of
[[lem-cardinal-operations-are-well-defined]] well-orders each of the two sets
explicitly, and [[lem-cardinality-of-a-well-orderable-set]] then supplies the
least equinumerous ordinal. **No choice principle is used.**

**Exponentiation.**

$$\kappa^{\lambda} \;:=\; \lvert {}^{\lambda}\kappa \rvert ,$$

the number of functions from a set of size $\lambda$ to a set of size $\kappa$.
The right-hand side is defined exactly when ${}^{\lambda}\kappa$ is
well-orderable. **Assuming the Axiom of Choice** ([[def-axiom-of-choice]]) every
set is well-orderable ([[thm-well-ordering-theorem]]) and $\kappa^{\lambda}$ is
defined for all cardinals; every statement on this page that writes
$\kappa^{\lambda}$ for an infinite exponent says so in its own hypotheses.

**Transport to arbitrary sets.** If $A$ and $B$ are well-orderable with
$\lvert A \rvert = \kappa$ and $\lvert B \rvert = \lambda$, then

$$\lvert A \sqcup B \rvert = \kappa \oplus \lambda, \qquad \lvert A \times B \rvert = \kappa \otimes \lambda, \qquad \lvert {}^{B}A \rvert = \kappa^{\lambda}$$

whenever the sets on the left have cardinalities at all, because $A \approx \kappa$
and $B \approx \lambda$ ([[def-equinumerous]]) and the three constructions
respect $\approx$ (claim (a) of [[lem-cardinal-operations-are-well-defined]],
[[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]). So the operations may be computed from
any representatives.

**Finite and infinite cardinals.** A cardinal $\kappa$ is **finite** when
$\kappa \in \omega$ and **infinite** when $\omega \subseteq \kappa$, that is
$\omega \le \kappa$; by trichotomy ([[lem-ordinal-trichotomy]]) and
[[lem-omega-least-limit-ordinal]] every cardinal is exactly one of the two.

## Remarks

**The symbols $\oplus$ and $\otimes$ are not decoration.** Ordinal addition and
ordinal multiplication ([[def-ordinal-addition]], [[def-ordinal-multiplication]])
are defined on **the same objects** — cardinals are ordinals — and give
**different values**. With $\omega$ read as a cardinal,
$\omega \oplus \omega = \omega$, whereas the ordinal sum $\omega + \omega$ is
strictly larger than $\omega$; and $\omega \otimes \omega = \omega$, whereas the
ordinal product $\omega \cdot \omega$ is larger still. Writing both operations
with $+$ and $\cdot$ would make every equation on this page ambiguous, so the
cardinal operations get their own symbols and the plain $+$ and $\cdot$ on this
page always mean the ordinal ones.

**Exponentiation keeps the symbol, under a hard rule.** There is no comparably
readable alternative to $\kappa^{\lambda}$, and
[[rem-ordinal-versus-cardinal-exponentiation]] already records that
$\alpha^{\beta}$ is used for two different operations: as ordinals
$2^{\omega} = \omega$, while the cardinal $2^{\omega}$ counts the functions
$\omega \to \{0,1\}$ and is uncountable. The rule adopted here, and followed on
this page and its companion, is:

> **In an exponential, the base and the exponent are always alephs, letters or
> expressions denoting cardinals — $\kappa$, $\lambda$, $\mu$,
> $\mathfrak{c}$, $\operatorname{cf}(\kappa)$, $\lvert A \rvert$ — or a natural
> number read as a cardinal; never $\omega$, never $\omega_1$, and never a
> letter denoting an ordinal, such as $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \xi, \eta$.**

So $2^{\aleph_0}$, $\kappa^{\lambda}$ and $\aleph_1^{\aleph_0}$ are cardinal
exponentials, and an expression such as $\omega^{\omega}$ or $\alpha^{\beta}$ is
never written here at all. Where a value has to be named in both readings, the
two are given different letters.

**What is being counted, in each case.** $\kappa \oplus \lambda$ is the size of
two disjoint blocks laid side by side; the tagging in $\sqcup$ is what makes
"disjoint" true even though one of $\kappa$ and $\lambda$ is always a subset of
the other, so their intersection is the smaller of the two. $\kappa \otimes \lambda$
is the size of a rectangle. $\kappa^{\lambda}$ is the number of ways to choose a
value in $\kappa$ for each of $\lambda$ positions, independently. None of the
three is sensitive to the order in which the elements are arranged, which is
exactly what distinguishes them from the ordinal operations
([[def-ordinal-exponentiation]] included), whose values depend on the arrangement.

**The zero and one cases are not special.** $0 = \varnothing$ and $1 = \{0\}$ are
cardinals ([[def-ordinal]]), and the definitions apply to them unchanged:
$\kappa \sqcup 0 = \{0\} \times \kappa$, $\kappa \times 0 = \varnothing$, and
${}^{0}\kappa = \{\varnothing\}$ has exactly one element, the empty function.
The resulting unit laws are proved rather than stipulated, in
[[lem-cardinal-arithmetic-basic-laws]].
