## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the field of real numbers with its order
([[def-real-numbers]], [[thm-reals-ordered-field]]) and $\mathbb{Z}$ is the
totally ordered commutative ring of integers ([[def-integers]],
[[def-int-operations]], [[def-int-order]], [[thm-int-ordered-ring]]).

For a function $f : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R}$ write

$$\operatorname{supp} f \;:=\; \{\, k \in \mathbb{Z} : f(k) \ne 0 \,\},$$

and say that $\operatorname{supp} f$ is **bounded below** when there is
$m \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $f(k) = 0$ for every $k < m$. The set of **formal Laurent
series in $t^{-1}$ over $\mathbb{R}$** is

$$K \;=\; \mathbb{R}((t^{-1})) \;:=\; \{\, f : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R} \;\mid\; \operatorname{supp} f \text{ is bounded below} \,\},$$

equipped with

$$(f + g)(k) := f(k) + g(k), \qquad (fg)(k) := \sum_{i + j = k} f(i)\,g(j),$$

where the product sum ranges over the pairs $(i,j) \in \mathbb{Z} \times
\mathbb{Z}$ with $i + j = k$ and $f(i)g(j) \ne 0$. That set of pairs is finite
for every $k$, and $f + g$ and $fg$ again lie in $K$: this is
[[lem-laurent-series-ring]], which also proves that $K$ with these operations is
a commutative ring whose zero $0_K$ is the constant function $0$ and whose
identity $1_K$ is the function taking the value $1$ at $0$ and $0$ elsewhere.

**Distinguished elements.** For $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ let $t^{-n} \in K$ be the
function taking the value $1$ at $n$ and $0$ at every other index; so
$t^{0} = 1_K$, and $t := t^{-(-1)}$ is the function taking the value $1$ at $-1$.
For $c \in \mathbb{R}$ let $\iota(c) \in K$ be the function taking the value $c$
at $0$ and $0$ elsewhere. The notation $t^{-n}$ is *defined* here as a name;
that it is consistent with the ring multiplication, $t^{-m} \, t^{-n} =
t^{-(m+n)}$, is proved in [[lem-laurent-series-ring]].

**Series notation.** Because $\operatorname{supp} f$ is bounded below, say by
$m$, one writes

$$f \;=\; \sum_{k \ge m} f(k)\, t^{-k},$$

a purely notational device: the object is the function $f$, and no convergence
of any kind is asserted or used.

**Valuation and leading coefficient.** Let $f \in K$ with $f \ne 0_K$. Then
$\operatorname{supp} f$ is nonempty and bounded below, so it has a least element
([[lem-laurent-series-ring]]). Define

$$v(f) \;:=\; \min \operatorname{supp} f \in \mathbb{Z}, \qquad \operatorname{lc}(f) \;:=\; f(v(f)) \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}.$$

$v(f)$ is the **valuation** and $\operatorname{lc}(f)$ the **leading
coefficient** of $f$. Neither is defined at $f = 0_K$, whose support is empty;
every statement about $v$ or $\operatorname{lc}$ in this library carries the
hypothesis $f \ne 0_K$ explicitly.

**Order.** The **positive cone** of $K$ is

$$P \;:=\; \{\, f \in K : f \ne 0_K \text{ and } \operatorname{lc}(f) > 0 \,\},$$

that is, a nonzero series is positive exactly when its lowest-index nonzero
coefficient is a positive real. That $(K, P)$ is an ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]) is [[thm-laurent-ordered-field]], and
that every nonzero element of $K$ is invertible is
[[thm-laurent-series-field]]. As in any ordered field, $f < g$ means
$g - f \in P$.

## Remarks

- **Why the support must be bounded below.** It is exactly what makes the
  product a finite sum. If arbitrary functions $\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R}$ were
  admitted, the defining sum for $(fg)(k)$ would range over an infinite set of
  pairs and would denote nothing, since $K$ carries no notion of convergence.
  The condition is preserved by both operations, which is the content of
  [[lem-laurent-series-ring]].

- **Indices run over all of $\mathbb{Z}$, and the edge cases are real.** The zero
  series has empty support and no valuation. A nonzero constant series
  $\iota(c)$ has $v(\iota(c)) = 0$ and $\operatorname{lc}(\iota(c)) = c$, so the
  index $k = 0$ is an ordinary index and not a boundary. Negative indices are
  admitted, and they are what makes $t = t^{-(-1)}$, whose support is $\{-1\}$,
  an element of $K$; a series may have finitely many terms of negative index but
  never infinitely many.

- **The order is not the coefficientwise order.** Two series are compared by
  their *lowest* differing coefficient, not by all of them at once, and this is
  what makes $t^{-1}$ smaller than every positive real constant while $t$ is
  larger than every real constant. The consequences are drawn in
  [[lem-laurent-non-archimedean]].

- **Relation to the rational functions.** The ordered field $\mathbb{R}(t)$ of
  [[cex-ordered-field-not-archimedean]], ordered so that $f > 0$ exactly when
  $f(x) > 0$ for all sufficiently large real $x$, is the standard first example
  of a non-Archimedean ordered field, and standard treatments identify it with a
  subfield of $K$ by expanding each rational function at infinity. **This page
  neither constructs that identification nor uses it**, and no item here may be
  cited for it: everything proved about $K$ below is proved from the definition
  above and nothing else. What the two objects share, and all that is used here,
  is the idea of ordering by behaviour at infinity.
