## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be topological spaces
([[def-topological-space]]). Throughout, $X \times Y$ is the binary product
$\prod_{i<2} X_i$ with $X_0 = X$ and $X_1 = Y$ ([[def-product-topology]]),
carrying the product topology; a point of it is a **function** $z$ on the von
Neumann natural $2 = \{0,1\}$, written $(z_0, z_1)$, and $\pi_0, \pi_1$ are the
two projections.

**The basis used throughout.** For the index set $2$ the product basis and the
box basis coincide, since a box $\prod_{i<2} U_i$ has all but finitely many
factors unrestricted for the trivial reason that it has only two
([[def-product-topology]]). So

$$\{\, U \times V : U \in \mathcal{T},\ V \in \mathcal{T}_Y \,\}$$

is a basis for the product topology on $X \times Y$, and every statement below
that tests a basic open set tests a box of two open sets.

**The diagonal.** The **diagonal** of $X$ is

$$\Delta_X \;:=\; \{\, z \in X \times X : z_0 = z_1 \,\} \;=\; \{\, (x,x) : x \in X \,\} ,$$

the second description being the first read through the definition of a point of
the product as a function on $2$. It is a subset of $X \times X$ and is given the
subspace topology ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]) whenever it is regarded as a
space.

**The diagonal map.** The **diagonal map** of $X$ is

$$\delta_X : X \to X \times X, \qquad \delta_X(x) := (x,x) ,$$

that is, the function sending $x$ to the constant function $2 \to X$ with value
$x$. Its two components are $\pi_0 \circ \delta_X = \mathrm{id}_X$ and
$\pi_1 \circ \delta_X = \mathrm{id}_X$, and by claim 2 of
[[thm-product-universal-property]] it is the *unique* function $X \to X \times X$
with those two components. The same claim makes it **continuous**
([[def-continuous-map-top]]), the identity being continuous. Its image is
$\Delta_X$, and it is injective, since $\delta_X(x) = \delta_X(x')$ forces
$x = x'$ by reading the coordinate at $0$. Whether $\delta_X$ is an **embedding**
onto $\Delta_X$ ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]) is not asserted here; it is
the content of the next item.

**The pairing of two maps.** For functions $f : Z \to X$ and $g : Z \to Y$ on a
common domain, the **pairing** is

$$\langle f, g \rangle : Z \to X \times Y, \qquad \langle f, g \rangle(z) := (f(z), g(z)) .$$

By claim 2 of [[thm-product-universal-property]] it is the unique function
$Z \to X \times Y$ with $\pi_0 \circ \langle f, g \rangle = f$ and
$\pi_1 \circ \langle f, g \rangle = g$; no hypothesis on $f$ and $g$ is needed
for the pairing to be defined, and continuity of the pairing is exactly
continuity of both components, which is again that claim. In this notation

$$\delta_X = \langle \mathrm{id}_X, \mathrm{id}_X \rangle ,$$

so the diagonal map is a special case of the pairing and needs no separate
treatment.

**The preimage identity that every later proof uses.** For $f, g : Z \to Y$,

$$\langle f, g \rangle^{-1}[\Delta_Y] \;=\; \{\, z \in Z : f(z) = g(z) \,\} ,$$

directly from the definitions above: $\langle f, g \rangle(z) \in \Delta_Y$ says
that the function $(f(z), g(z))$ on $2$ takes the same value at $0$ and at $1$.

## Remarks

- **The diagonal is a subset of a product, and the diagonal map is a function
  into it; they are different objects with the same name.** The set $\Delta_X$
  records which pairs are repetitions, and the map $\delta_X$ produces the
  repetitions. Both are needed: the closedness criterion of this page is about the
  set, and the transport of properties from $X$ to its copy inside the square is
  about the map.

- **Nothing here depends on a choice principle.** The product $X \times X$ is a
  binary product, and a point of it is exhibited by naming its two coordinates;
  the nonemptiness of an arbitrary product, which is where choice enters
  ([[thm-product-universal-property]], claim 4), is never invoked for a binary
  product with a named point.

- **Why the box description is recorded at the top.** The criterion proved on
  this page tests basic open sets of $X \times X$, and for the binary product
  there is no gap between the box topology and the product topology to worry
  about ([[def-product-topology]]). No infinite product is formed anywhere on
  this page, so the distinction never becomes live here.
