## Statement

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, let $\mathcal{B}$ be a basis for
$\mathcal{T}$ ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]), let $A \subseteq X$ and let
$x \in X$. Closure, derived set and limit points are as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]. Then:

1. The following four conditions are equivalent.
   - (a) $x \in \overline{A}$;
   - (b) $N \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every neighbourhood $N$ of $x$
     ([[def-neighbourhood-top]]);
   - (c) $U \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every open $U$ with $x \in U$;
   - (d) $B \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every $B \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B$.
2. $\overline{A}$ is closed, contains $A$, and is contained in every closed
   $F \subseteq X$ with $A \subseteq F$; so it is the smallest closed superset of
   $A$, and $A$ is closed if and only if $A = \overline{A}$.
3. $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$.

Claim 2 is recorded here for reference and is discharged in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]], where it is what makes the definition of
$\overline{A}$ well posed; claims 1 and 3 are proved below. Claim 1 is the form in
which the closure is used everywhere afterwards, and clause (d) is what makes a
closure computable from a basis rather than from all open sets.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A topological space $(X,\mathcal{T})$, a basis $\mathcal{B}$ for $\mathcal{T}$, a subset $A \subseteq X$ and a point $x \in X$.

[A1] $\overline{A}$ is the intersection of all closed supersets of $A$; it is closed, contains $A$, and is contained in every closed superset of $A$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

[A2] $x \in A'$ means that $N \cap (A \setminus \{x\}) \ne \varnothing$ for every neighbourhood $N$ of $x$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

[L1] $N$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ when $x \in U \subseteq N$ for some open $U$; an open set containing $x$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ ([[def-neighbourhood-top]]).

[L2] $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for $\mathcal{T}$: for every open $U$ and every $x \in U$ there is $B \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B \subseteq U$, and every member of $\mathcal{B}$ is open ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]).

[L3] A set is closed exactly when its complement is open ([[def-topological-space]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 (a) implies (c): let $U$ be open with $x \in U$ and suppose $U \cap A = \varnothing$; then $X \setminus U$ is closed and contains $A$, so $\overline{A} \subseteq X \setminus U$ by [A1], whence $x \notin \overline{A}$, contradicting (a); therefore $U \cap A \ne \varnothing$. [A1, L3]

1.2 (c) implies (a): suppose $x \notin \overline{A}$; then $U := X \setminus \overline{A}$ is open by [A1] and [L3], contains $x$, and satisfies $U \cap A = \varnothing$ because $A \subseteq \overline{A}$, so (c) fails. [A1, L3]

1.3 (b) implies (c): an open $U$ containing $x$ is a neighbourhood of $x$, so (b) applies to it. [L1]

1.4 (c) implies (b): let $N$ be a neighbourhood of $x$ and fix open $U$ with $x \in U \subseteq N$; then $\varnothing \ne U \cap A \subseteq N \cap A$. [L1]

1.5 (c) implies (d): every $B \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B$ is an open set containing $x$. [L2]

1.6 (d) implies (c): let $U$ be open with $x \in U$ and fix $B \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B \subseteq U$; then $\varnothing \ne B \cap A \subseteq U \cap A$. [L2]

1.7 $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ and $\overline{A}$ is closed, and $\overline{A}$ is contained in every closed superset of $A$, which is claim 2; in particular $A$ is closed exactly when $A = \overline{A}$, since one inclusion always holds and the other says that $A$ is a closed superset of itself. [A1, L3]

2.1 By steps 1.1 to 1.6 the four conditions (a), (b), (c) and (d) are equivalent, which is claim 1: (a) and (c) are equivalent by steps 1.1 and 1.2, (b) and (c) by steps 1.3 and 1.4, and (c) and (d) by steps 1.5 and 1.6. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6]

3.1 $A \cup A' \subseteq \overline{A}$: points of $A$ lie in $\overline{A}$ by [A1], and if $x \in A'$ then every neighbourhood $N$ of $x$ meets $A \setminus \{x\}$ and hence meets $A$, so $x \in \overline{A}$ by condition (b). [step 2.1, A1, A2]

3.2 $\overline{A} \subseteq A \cup A'$: let $x \in \overline{A}$ and suppose $x \notin A$; then for every neighbourhood $N$ of $x$ condition (b) gives $N \cap A \ne \varnothing$, and $A = A \setminus \{x\}$ because $x \notin A$, so $N \cap (A \setminus \{x\}) \ne \varnothing$ and $x \in A'$. [step 2.1, A2]

4.1 Steps 3.1 and 3.2 give $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$, which is claim 3; with step 2.1 for claim 1 and step 1.7 for claim 2 the theorem is proved. [step 1.7, step 2.1, step 3.1, step 3.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Clause (d) is relative to a basis and clause (c) is not.** Different bases for one topology give different families of test sets in (d), and the theorem says all of them detect the same closure. This is why a closure in a metric space may be computed with balls alone, and a closure in $\mathbb{R}$ with bounded open intervals alone.

- **The empty set and the whole space.** $\overline{\varnothing} = \varnothing$, since $\varnothing$ is closed, and $\overline{X} = X$; claim 1 reads correctly in both cases, no neighbourhood meeting $\varnothing$ and every neighbourhood meeting $X$.

- **Nothing here assumes that singletons are closed.** In the indiscrete topology on a set with at least two points, $\overline{\{x\}} = X$ for every $x$, since the only neighbourhood of any point is $X$; claim 3 then says $A' = X \setminus \{x\}$ is contained in $\overline{\{x\}}$, which it is.
