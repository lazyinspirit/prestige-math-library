## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]).

- $X$ is **$T_0$**, or a **Kolmogorov space**, when any two distinct points are
  *topologically distinguishable*: for all $x, y \in X$ with $x \ne y$ there is
  an open set containing exactly one of $x$ and $y$.
- $X$ is **$T_1$**, or a **Frechet space**, when each of any two distinct points
  has an open set containing it and missing the other: for all $x, y \in X$ with
  $x \ne y$ there are $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$ with

$$x \in U, \quad y \notin U, \qquad y \in V, \quad x \notin V .$$

Nothing is asserted about a pair of equal points, so a space with at most one
point satisfies both conditions vacuously.

Since an open set containing a point is an open neighbourhood of it
([[def-neighbourhood-top]]), both conditions may be read with "open
neighbourhood" in place of "open set"; and by the same equivalence recorded in
[[def-neighbourhood-top]] they may be read with arbitrary neighbourhoods, since
a neighbourhood of $x$ contains an open one and an open neighbourhood is a
neighbourhood.

**Every $T_1$ space is $T_0$, and this is discharged here** rather than left to
the reader, because it is the bottom arrow of the whole hierarchy on this page.
Let $x \ne y$ and take $U, V$ as in the $T_1$ condition. Then $U$ is an open set
containing $x$ and not $y$, so it contains exactly one of the two points, which
is the $T_0$ condition. Only the first half of the $T_1$ condition is used, so
the implication does not reverse formally, and it does not reverse in fact:
Sierpinski space is a witness, recorded on the companion page.

**The two conditions differ exactly in symmetry.** $T_0$ asks for *one* open set
that tells the pair apart, with no control over which of the two it contains;
$T_1$ asks for *both* separations at once. In Sierpinski space
$(\{a,b\}, \{\varnothing, \{b\}, \{a,b\}\})$ of [[def-standard-topologies]] the
open set $\{b\}$ contains $b$ and not $a$, so the space is $T_0$; but the only
open set containing $a$ is the whole space, which also contains $b$, so it is
not $T_1$.

**Neither condition is a property of a set alone.** Both are properties of the
pair $(X, \mathcal{T})$, and both are inherited upwards along the comparison
order of [[def-topological-space]]: if $\mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2$
and $(X,\mathcal{T}_1)$ is $T_0$, respectively $T_1$, then so is
$(X,\mathcal{T}_2)$, since the separating open sets of the coarser topology lie
in the finer one. In particular the discrete topology satisfies both, and the
indiscrete topology on a set with at least two points satisfies neither.

## Remarks

- **The names.** The numbering $T_0, T_1, T_2, \dots$ is Alexandroff and Hopf's
  *Trennungsaxiome*; the individual names honour Kolmogorov and Frechet. This
  page fixes each axiom by its condition and treats the numeral as an
  abbreviation, because the numerals above $T_3$ are used inconsistently in the
  literature ([[rem-separation-axiom-conventions]]).

- **What $T_1$ says about closures.** $T_1$ is equivalent to the closedness of
  every singleton, and hence to $\overline{\{x\}} = \{x\}$ for every point
  ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]); that equivalence is the next item and
  is a theorem, not a restatement. The corresponding characterisation of $T_0$,
  that distinct points have distinct closures, is not needed on this page and is
  not proved here.

- **No separation is built into the word *space*.** [[def-topological-space]]
  assumes none, and [[rem-topology-conventions]] records that decision; every
  separation property on this page is a hypothesis written out where it is used.
