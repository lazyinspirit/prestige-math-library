## Statement

Let $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be order-convex ([[def-interval]]) and let
$f : I \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $I$ ([[def-continuity-real]]) and
injective ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]). Then:

1. $f$ is strictly monotone ([[def-monotone-function]]);
2. $f[I]$ is order-convex;
3. the map $f : I \to f[I]$ is a bijection, so there is exactly one
   $g : f[I] \to I$ with $g(f(x)) = x$ for every $x \in I$ and $f(g(u)) = u$ for
   every $u \in f[I]$;
4. $g$ is strictly monotone in the same sense as $f$: increasing if $f$ is
   increasing, decreasing if $f$ is decreasing;
5. $g$ is continuous on $f[I]$.

**"Interval" means "order-convex" here**, as throughout this library
([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]] is what licenses the word and
[[def-interval]] records that the classification of order-convex sets into the
nine written forms is not proved here). No compactness and no boundedness is
assumed: $I$ may be open, half-open, unbounded, or a single point.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An order-convex $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a continuous injective $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] A continuous injective function on an order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is strictly monotone ([[thm-continuous-injection-on-an-interval-is-strictly-monotone]]).

[L2] The image of an order-convex subset of the domain under a continuous function is order-convex ([[cor-continuous-image-of-an-interval-is-an-interval]], claim 1).

[L3] If $J \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is order-convex, $h : J \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfies $h(u) \le h(v)$ whenever $u, v \in J$ and $u \le v$, and $h[J]$ is order-convex, then $h$ is continuous on $J$ ([[lem-monotone-with-interval-image-is-continuous]]).

[L4] Sums, scalar multiples and composites of continuous functions are continuous; in particular $u \mapsto -u$ is continuous on every subset of $\mathbb{R}$, being the scalar multiple $(-1)\,\mathrm{id}$ of the identity ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], [[thm-composition-of-continuous-functions]]).

[L5] $f$ is injective, so $f : I \to f[I]$ is a bijection and has a unique two-sided inverse ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L6] $f$ increasing means $f(x) < f(y)$ whenever $x < y$ in $I$; $-f$ is decreasing exactly when $f$ is increasing, and $-S$ is order-convex exactly when $S$ is ([[def-monotone-function]], [[def-interval]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Claim 1 is immediate: $f$ is continuous and injective on the order-convex set $I$, hence strictly monotone. [L1]

1.2 Claim 2 is immediate: $I$ is order-convex and $f$ is continuous on $I$, so $f[I]$ is order-convex. [L2]

1.3 Claim 3 is immediate: $f$ is injective and $f : I \to f[I]$ is onto its image by definition of the image, so it is a bijection and has a unique two-sided inverse $g : f[I] \to I$. [L5]

2.1 Suppose $f$ is increasing, and let $u, v \in f[I]$ with $u < v$. Write $u = f(p)$ and $v = f(q)$ with $p = g(u)$ and $q = g(v)$ in $I$. If $q \le p$ then $f(q) \le f(p)$, since $q = p$ gives equality and $q < p$ gives $f(q) < f(p)$; that is $v \le u$, contradicting $u < v$. Hence $p < q$, that is $g(u) < g(v)$, and $g$ is increasing. [step 1.1, step 1.3, L6]

2.2 Suppose instead that $f$ is decreasing, and put $F := -f$, that is $F(x) := -f(x)$. Then $F$ is continuous on $I$, it is injective because $f$ is, and it is increasing. [step 1.1, L4, L6]

3.1 Still with $f$ increasing: $g$ satisfies $g(u) \le g(v)$ whenever $u \le v$ in $f[I]$, by step 2.1 when $u < v$ and trivially when $u = v$; the domain $f[I]$ is order-convex by step 1.2; and the image $g[f[I]]$ is $I$, which is order-convex, because $g$ is onto $I$. So the monotone-with-interval-image criterion applies and $g$ is continuous on $f[I]$. [step 1.2, step 1.3, step 2.1, L3]

4.1 By steps 2.1 and 3.1 applied to $F$, the inverse $G : F[I] \to I$ of $F$ is increasing and continuous, and $F[I] = -f[I]$ is order-convex. [step 2.1, step 3.1, step 2.2]

5.1 For $u \in f[I]$ one has $-u \in F[I]$ and $G(-u) = g(u)$, since $F(g(u)) = -f(g(u)) = -u$ and $G$ is the inverse of $F$. So $g$ is the composite of the continuous map $u \mapsto -u$ from $f[I]$ into $F[I]$ with the continuous $G$, hence continuous on $f[I]$. [step 1.3, step 4.1, L4]

6.1 In that case $g$ is decreasing: for $u < v$ in $f[I]$ one has $-v < -u$ in $F[I]$, so $G(-v) < G(-u)$ because $G$ is increasing, that is $g(v) < g(u)$. [step 4.1, step 5.1]

7.1 Claims 4 and 5 are now proved in both cases: for $f$ increasing by steps 2.1 and 3.1, and for $f$ decreasing by steps 5.1 and 6.1; and by step 1.1 there is no other case. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 3.1, step 5.1, step 6.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **No epsilon-delta argument appears anywhere.** Continuity of the inverse is obtained entirely from [[lem-monotone-with-interval-image-is-continuous]], whose hypotheses are exactly the two facts the theorem has already established: the inverse is monotone, and its image is the order-convex set $I$. The decreasing case is reduced to the increasing one by composing with $u \mapsto -u$ rather than repeating the argument.

- **What the theorem is used for.** It is the tool that turns a strictly monotone continuous bijection into a continuous one in the other direction, and the standard elementary functions are built with it: the companion page derives the continuity of $x \mapsto x^{1/n}$ this way.
