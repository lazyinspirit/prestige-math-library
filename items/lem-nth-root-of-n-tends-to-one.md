## Statement

For a natural number $n \ge 1$ write $\iota(n) := n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the
canonical natural of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]) and
$n^{1/n} := \iota(n)^{1/n}$, $n^{1/2} := \iota(n)^{1/2}$ for its roots
([[thm-nth-roots-exist]], [[def-rational-power]]). Then:

1. $\displaystyle 1 \;\le\; n^{1/n} \;\le\; 1 + \frac{2}{n^{1/2}}$ for every natural $n \ge 1$;
2. the sequence $r_k := (k+1)^{1/(k+1)}$, $k \in \mathbb{N}$, converges to $1$
   ([[def-real-limit]]).

**The index range is not cosmetic.** The expression $n^{1/n}$ is defined only for
$n \ge 1$, since $1/n$ is not a rational number when $n = 0$
([[def-rational-power]]). Sequences in this library are functions on $\mathbb{N}$
and $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$ ([[def-sequence]]), so the statement of convergence
is made about the shifted family $r_k = (k+1)^{1/(k+1)}$, which is the classical
family $n^{1/n}$, $n \ge 1$, reindexed by $n = k+1$. Claim 1 is stated over the
natural range $n \ge 1$ where the expression means something.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** For a natural $m \ge 1$ the canonical natural $\iota(m) := m \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$, extended by $\iota(0) := 0$; this extension keeps the additivity $\iota(m + m') = \iota(m) + \iota(m')$ of [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], which for $m$ or $m'$ equal to $0$ reads $\iota(m) = \iota(m) + 0$.

[L1] Roots: for real $a \ge 0$ and natural $n \ge 1$ there is a unique real $s \ge 0$ with $s^n = a$, written $a^{1/n}$; it is $> 0$ when $a > 0$, and $a^{1/1} = a$ ([[thm-nth-roots-exist]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L2] Rational powers and monotonicity: $a^{1/n}$ is the rational power $a^r$ at $r = 1/n$, and for rational $t > 0$ one has $a^t > 1$ whenever $a > 1$; also $\big(1/a\big)^{1/2} = 1/a^{1/2}$ for $a > 0$ ([[def-rational-power]], [[lem-rational-power-monotone]], [[lem-rational-power-laws]]).

[L3] AM-GM: for a natural $n \ge 1$ and reals $a_0, \dots, a_{n-1} \ge 0$, the geometric mean $\big(\prod_{j<n} a_j\big)^{1/n}$ is $\le$ the arithmetic mean $\frac{1}{\iota(n)}\sum_{j<n} a_j$ ([[thm-am-gm]]).

[L4] Finite sums and products: the empty sum is $0$ and the empty product $1$; sums and products split at any intermediate index; and $\sum_{j<m} \lambda = \iota(m)\lambda$ for a constant $\lambda$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L5] Induction principle ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L6] Canonical naturals: $\iota(m) > 0$ and $\iota(m)$ is invertible for $m \ge 1$, $\iota$ is strictly increasing, and $\iota(2) = 2 > 1$; the Archimedean property gives, for every real $x$, a natural $p \ge 1$ with $x < \iota(p)$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[thm-of-archimedean]]).

[L7] Order and reciprocals: $0 < a < b$ gives $0 < 1/b < 1/a$; multiplying an inequality by a positive element preserves it; and inequalities may be added and translated ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[lem-of-add-order]]).

[L8] Squares: for $a, b \ge 0$ one has $a < b$ if and only if $a \cdot a < b \cdot b$ ([[lem-power-monotone]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L9] Squeeze theorem, and the fact that a constant sequence converges to its value; to establish convergence it suffices to produce a threshold for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[thm-squeeze]], [[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L10] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total and $\iota$ respects it ([[def-nat-order]], [[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For a natural $n \ge 1$ the element $\iota(n)$ is positive and invertible, so $\iota(n)^{1/n}$ and $\iota(n)^{1/2}$ exist and are positive. [given, L1, L6]

1.2 For every natural $m$ one has $\prod_{j<m} 1 = 1$: the empty product is $1$, and if $\prod_{j<m} 1 = 1$ then $\prod_{j<m+1} 1 = \big(\prod_{j<m} 1\big) \cdot 1 = 1$, so this follows by induction on $m$. [given, L4, L5]

2.1 For $n = 1$ one has $\iota(1) = 1$ and $1^{1/1} = 1$; for $n \ge 2$ one has $\iota(n) \ge \iota(2) = 2 > 1$ and $1/n$ is a positive rational, so $\iota(n)^{1/n} > 1$. In either case $n^{1/n} \ge 1$. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L6, L10]

2.2 Let $n \ge 2$ and put $u := \iota(n)^{1/2}$, so that $u > 0$ and $u \cdot u = \iota(n)$. Apply [L3] to the list of $n$ nonnegative reals given by $a_0 = a_1 = u$ and $a_j = 1$ for $2 \le j < n$, the latter range being empty when $n = 2$. Splitting at index $2$ gives $\prod_{j<n} a_j = \big(\prod_{j<2} a_j\big)\big(\prod_{j<n-2} a_{2+j}\big) = (u \cdot u) \cdot 1 = \iota(n)$ by step 1.2, so the geometric mean is $\iota(n)^{1/n}$; and $\sum_{j<n} a_j = \big(\sum_{j<2} a_j\big) + \big(\sum_{j<n-2} 1\big) = (u + u) + \iota(n-2) = (u+u) + \iota(n) - 2$, using additivity of $\iota$ and $\iota(2) = 2$, so the arithmetic mean is $A = \big((u+u) + \iota(n) - 2\big)/\iota(n) = 1 + \big((u+u) - 2\big)/\iota(n)$. Since $(u+u) - 2 < u + u$ and $\iota(n) > 0$, and $(u+u)/\iota(n) = (u+u)/(u \cdot u) = 2/u$, this gives $\iota(n)^{1/n} \le A \le 1 + 2/u = 1 + 2/n^{1/2}$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1, L3, L4, L6, L7, algebra]

2.3 For $n = 1$ the same bound holds trivially: $1^{1/1} = 1 \le 1 + 2 = 1 + 2/1^{1/2}$. [step 1.1, L1, L6, L7]

2.4 The sequence $b_k := 1 + 2/(k+1)^{1/2}$ converges to $1$. Given a real $\varepsilon > 0$, put $t := 2/\varepsilon > 0$ and take a natural $p \ge 1$ with $t \cdot t < \iota(p)$. For $k \ge p$ we have $k + 1 > p$, hence $\iota(k+1) > \iota(p) > t \cdot t$, and since $\big(\iota(k+1)^{1/2}\big)\big(\iota(k+1)^{1/2}\big) = \iota(k+1)$ with both factors $\ge 0$, this forces $t < \iota(k+1)^{1/2}$. Therefore $0 < 2/\iota(k+1)^{1/2} < 2/t = \varepsilon$, that is $|b_k - 1| < \varepsilon$. [step 1.1, L1, L6, L7, L8, L9, L10, algebra]

3.1 Claim 1 is the combination of steps 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, the two upper bounds covering $n \ge 2$ and $n = 1$ respectively. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3]

4.1 For every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ the natural $k+1$ is $\ge 1$, so claim 1 gives $1 \le r_k \le b_k$. The constant sequence $1$ converges to $1$ and $(b_k)$ converges to $1$ by step 2.4, so the squeeze theorem gives $r_k \to 1$, which is claim 2. [step 3.1, step 2.4, L9] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the $\sqrt{n}$ comes from.** AM-GM is applied to a list whose product is
  $n$ but whose entries are as close to $1$ as possible: two copies of $n^{1/2}$
  and $n-2$ copies of $1$. The arithmetic mean is then
  $1 + (2n^{1/2} - 2)/n$, which tends to $1$ at the rate $2/n^{1/2}$. Splitting
  $n$ as $n^{1/2} \cdot n^{1/2}$ rather than as $n \cdot 1$ is the whole trick:
  the list $n, 1, \dots, 1$ gives only $n^{1/n} \le 2 - 1/n$, which does not
  converge to $1$.

- **The lower bound is not decoration.** Without $n^{1/n} \ge 1$ the squeeze has
  nothing below it, and the upper bound alone would leave open a limit smaller
  than $1$. It comes from monotonicity of rational powers in the base
  ([[lem-rational-power-monotone]]) and holds with equality only at $n = 1$.

- **No logarithm and no exponential is used.** The usual quick proof writes
  $n^{1/n} = e^{(\log n)/n}$ and appeals to $(\log n)/n \to 0$; neither function
  exists in this library yet, and the AM-GM route needs nothing beyond roots and
  finite sums.
