## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]) and write
$\Lambda := \limsup_{k} x_k \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-limsup-liminf]]).
Then, with the extended subsequential limit set
$\overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$ of [[def-extended-limits]]:

1. $\Lambda \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$: there is a strictly increasing
   $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that $(x_{n_j})$ converges to $\Lambda$ in
   $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$;
2. $L \le \Lambda$ for every $L \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$.

So $\overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$ is **nonempty** and has a **greatest
element**, and that element is $\limsup_k x_k$. In particular every sequence of
reals whatever has a subsequence that converges in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$.

**The extended set is the right home for this statement, and the real set is
not.** The finite subsequential limit set $\operatorname{SL}(x)$ of
[[def-subsequential-limit]] may be empty, and when it is not it may have a
greatest element different from $\limsup_k x_k$; both failures are exhibited by
the dedicated counterexample on the companion page. What is true for
$\operatorname{SL}(x)$ follows: when $\Lambda$ is a real number, claim 1 puts it
in $\operatorname{SL}(x)$, since the two sets agree on $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-extended-limits]]), and claim 2 then makes it the greatest element there
too.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals, its tail ranges $T_n = \{x_k : k \ge n\}$, the extended tail suprema $s_n = \sup T_n$, and $\Lambda := \limsup_k x_k = \inf\{s_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ ([[def-limsup-liminf]]).

[L1] All of $s_n$ and $\Lambda$ exist in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, with $s_n$ the least upper bound of $T_n$ and $\Lambda$ the greatest lower bound of $\{s_n\}$ ([[lem-limsup-exists]], [[lem-extended-reals-complete]], [[def-upper-bound]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L2] The order on $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is total, so the failure of $a \le b$ is $b < a$; $-\infty$ is least and $+\infty$ greatest; every real is $< +\infty$ and $> -\infty$; and on $\mathbb{R}$ the order is that of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-extended-reals]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L3] Epsilon characterisation for a real $\Lambda$: for every real $\eta > 0$ one has $x_k < \Lambda + \eta$ eventually and $x_k > \Lambda - \eta$ frequently ([[lem-limsup-epsilon-characterisation]]).

[L4] Recursion theorem: for a set $A$, an element $a \in A$ and a function $f : A \to A$ there is a unique $g : \mathbb{N} \to A$ with $g_0 = a$ and $g_{j+1} = f(g_j)$ ([[thm-recursion]]).

[L5] Well-ordering principle: every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L6] Index maps: if $n_j < n_{j+1}$ for every $j$ then $n$ is strictly increasing, and then $n_j \ge j$ for every $j$; the composite $(x_{n_j})$ is a subsequence ([[lem-index-map-grows]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L7] Convergence in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ and the extended subsequential limit set ([[def-extended-limits]]); convergence to a real, for which it suffices to produce a threshold for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-real-limit]], [[def-sequence]]); divergence to $\pm\infty$ ([[def-divergence-to-infinity]]); and $|a - b| < c$ if and only if $b - c < a < b + c$ for $c > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L8] If $\limsup_k x_k = -\infty$ then $\liminf_k x_k = -\infty$ and $x_k \to -\infty$ ([[lem-liminf-le-limsup]], [[thm-convergence-iff-limsup-equals-liminf]]).

[L9] Limits preserve non-strict inequalities: if $y_j \le c$ for all large $j$ and $y_j \to y$ in $\mathbb{R}$, then $y \le c$ ([[lem-limit-preserves-order]]).

[L10] Archimedean facts: for every real $M$ there is a natural $p \ge 1$ with $M < p \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$, and for every real $\eta > 0$ a natural $m \ge 1$ with $1/m < \eta$; the canonical naturals satisfy $0 \le n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ and are increasing in $n$, and $0 < a \le b$ gives $0 < 1/b \le 1/a$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]], [[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

[L11] Strictly between any two reals lies a rational, hence a real ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L12] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total and transitive, so any two indices have a common upper bound ([[def-nat-order]], [[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 The element $\Lambda = \limsup_k x_k$ exists in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, and exactly one of the following holds: $\Lambda$ is a real number, $\Lambda = +\infty$, or $\Lambda = -\infty$. [given, L1, L2]

1.2 Suppose $\Lambda = +\infty$. Since $\Lambda$ is a lower bound of $\{s_n\}$, every $n$ has $+\infty \le s_n$ and so $s_n = +\infty$. Consequently, for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and every real $M$ there is $k \ge n$ with $x_k > M$: otherwise $M$ would be an upper bound of $T_n$ and leastness would give $s_n \le M$, contradicting $M < +\infty$. [given, L1, L2]

1.3 Suppose $\Lambda$ is real. Then for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and every real $\eta > 0$ there is $k \ge n$ with $|x_k - \Lambda| < \eta$: by [L3] fix $K$ with $x_k < \Lambda + \eta$ for all $k \ge K$, let $K'$ be an index at least as large as both $n$ and $K$, and use that $x_k > \Lambda - \eta$ frequently to obtain $k \ge K'$ with $x_k > \Lambda - \eta$; that $k$ satisfies $k \ge K$, hence also $x_k < \Lambda + \eta$, and $k \ge n$. [given, L3, L7, L12]

1.4 Suppose $\Lambda = -\infty$. Then $x_k \to -\infty$ by [L8], and the identity map $j \mapsto j$ is strictly increasing, so the subsequence $(x_j)$ of $(x_k)$ converges to $-\infty$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ and $\Lambda \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$. [given, L6, L7, L8]

1.5 Let $L \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$ be arbitrary and fix a strictly increasing $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that $(x_{n_j})$ converges to $L$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$; then $n_j \ge j$ for every $j$. [given, L6, L7]

2.1 In the case $\Lambda = +\infty$, define $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ by letting $f(n)$ be the least element of $E_n := \{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : k > n \text{ and } x_k > n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} \,\}$, which is nonempty by step 1.2 applied with the index $n+1$ and the real $M = n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$, and let $a$ be the least element of $\{\, k : x_k > 0 \,\}$, nonempty by step 1.2 with $n = 0$ and $M = 0$. Then $f(n) > n$ and $x_{f(n)} > n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ for every $n$. [step 1.2, L5, construct]

2.2 In the case $\Lambda$ real, define $g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ by letting $g(n)$ be the least element of $F_n := \{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : k > n \text{ and } |x_k - \Lambda| < 1/(n+1) \,\}$, which is nonempty by step 1.3 applied with the index $n+1$ and $\eta = 1/(n+1) > 0$, and let $b$ be the least element of $\{\, k : |x_k - \Lambda| < 1 \,\}$, nonempty by step 1.3 with $n = 0$ and $\eta = 1$. Then $g(n) > n$ and $|x_{g(n)} - \Lambda| < 1/(n+1)$ for every $n$. [step 1.3, L5, L10, construct]

2.3 If $L = -\infty$ then $L \le \Lambda$, since $-\infty$ is the least element of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$. [step 1.5, L2]

2.4 If $L = +\infty$, then for every real $M$ there is $J$ with $x_{n_j} > M$ for all $j \ge J$. Fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and a real $M$, and take $j$ at least as large as both $J$ and $n$; then $n_j \ge j \ge n$, so $x_{n_j} \in T_n$ and $M < x_{n_j} \le s_n$. As $M$ was an arbitrary real, $s_n$ is neither real nor $-\infty$, so $s_n = +\infty$; as $n$ was arbitrary, $\Lambda = \inf\{s_n\} = +\infty$ and $L \le \Lambda$. [step 1.5, L1, L2, L7, L12]

2.5 If $L$ is real, suppose for the sake of the comparison that $\Lambda < L$. By step 1.1 the element $\Lambda$ is then real or $-\infty$; choose a real $c$ with $\Lambda < c < L$, taking a rational strictly between $\Lambda$ and $L$ in the first case and $c := L - 1$ in the second. Since $\Lambda$ is the greatest lower bound of $\{s_n\}$ and $\Lambda < c$, the element $c$ is not a lower bound, so there is $n$ with $s_n < c$, and then $x_k \le s_n < c$ for every $k \ge n$. For $j \ge n$ we have $n_j \ge j \ge n$, hence $x_{n_j} \le c$, so $L \le c$ by [L9], contradicting $c < L$. By totality $L \le \Lambda$. [step 1.5, step 1.1, L1, L2, L9, L11]

3.1 In the case $\Lambda = +\infty$, the recursion theorem applied to $\mathbb{N}$, the element $a$ and the function $f$ gives $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ with $n_0 = a$ and $n_{j+1} = f(n_j)$. Then $n_j < n_{j+1}$ for every $j$, so $n$ is strictly increasing and $n_j \ge j$; and $x_{n_{j+1}} > n_j \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} \ge j \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ for every $j$. [step 2.1, L4, L6, L10]

3.2 In the case $\Lambda$ real, the recursion theorem applied to $\mathbb{N}$, the element $b$ and the function $g$ gives $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ with $n_0 = b$ and $n_{j+1} = g(n_j)$. Then $n$ is strictly increasing with $n_j \ge j$, and $|x_{n_{j+1}} - \Lambda| < 1/(n_j + 1) \le 1/(j+1)$ for every $j$. [step 2.2, L4, L6, L10]

4.1 In the case $\Lambda = +\infty$, the subsequence $(x_{n_j})$ diverges to $+\infty$: given a real $M$, take a natural $p \ge 1$ with $M < p \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$; every $j \ge p + 1$ satisfies $j - 1 \ge p$, so step 3.1 applied at $j - 1$ gives $x_{n_j} > (j-1) \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} \ge p \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} > M$. Hence $(x_{n_j})$ converges to $+\infty = \Lambda$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ and $\Lambda \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$. [step 3.1, L7, L10, L12]

4.2 In the case $\Lambda$ real, the subsequence $(x_{n_j})$ converges to $\Lambda$: given a real $\varepsilon > 0$, take a natural $m \ge 1$ with $1/m < \varepsilon$; every $j \ge m$ satisfies $j \ge 1$, so step 3.2 applied at $j - 1$ gives $|x_{n_j} - \Lambda| < 1/j \le 1/m < \varepsilon$. Producing such a threshold for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ establishes convergence, so $(x_{n_j})$ converges to $\Lambda$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ and $\Lambda \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$. [step 3.2, L7, L10]

5.1 The three cases of step 1.1 are exhaustive, and each produces a subsequence converging to $\Lambda$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$: step 4.1 when $\Lambda = +\infty$, step 4.2 when $\Lambda$ is real, and step 1.4 when $\Lambda = -\infty$. So $\Lambda \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$, which is claim 1. [step 4.1, step 4.2, step 1.4, L7]

6.1 Steps 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 cover the three possibilities for an arbitrary $L \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$ and give $L \le \Lambda$ in each, which is claim 2. With claim 1 this makes $\overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$ nonempty with greatest element $\Lambda = \limsup_k x_k$. [step 5.1, step 2.3, step 2.4, step 2.5, L2, discharge-construct] ∎

## Remarks

- **The construction uses no choice.** Both index maps are built by taking a
  *least* element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]) of an explicitly described
  nonempty set of naturals, so the functions $f$ and $g$ are defined outright and
  [[thm-recursion]] then produces the index map. This is the same device as in
  [[lem-peak-monotone-subsequence]], and for the same reason: a subsequence
  selected by repeated arbitrary choices would need a choice principle, and none
  is needed here.

- **Why the recursion threshold is indexed by the previous index rather than by
  the step number.** The recursion theorem produces a function of one variable, so
  the state carried from one step to the next is the index $n_j$ alone. Demanding
  $x_{n_{j+1}} > n_j$ rather than $x_{n_{j+1}} > j$ keeps that single-variable
  form, and $n_j \ge j$ ([[lem-index-map-grows]]) then upgrades the bound to the
  one actually wanted. The same trick fixes the accuracy in the finite case at
  $1/(n_j+1) \le 1/(j+1)$.

- **Claim 2 is where the $\limsup$ earns the word "greatest".** A subsequence
  cannot do better than the tail suprema allow: past any index $n$, every term of
  the sequence, and so every term of any subsequence, is at most $s_n$, and
  $\Lambda$ is the infimum of those. That is the entire content of step 2.5, and
  the strictness of the inequality $\Lambda < c$ is what gives the contradiction,
  since a limit inherits only the non-strict inequality
  ([[lem-limit-preserves-order]]).

- **Both failures of the real version really occur**, and
  [[cex-limsup-infinite-not-attained-in-r]] on the companion page is the witness:
  there $\operatorname{SL}(x)$ is nonempty with greatest element $0$ while
  $\limsup_k x_k = +\infty$.

- **The dual statement is [[cor-liminf-is-least-subsequential-limit]]**, obtained
  from this theorem by reflection rather than by repeating the construction.
