## Definition

A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ ([[def-topological-space]]) is
**Hausdorff** when any two distinct points are separated by disjoint open sets:
for all $x, y \in X$ with $x \ne y$ there are $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$ with

$$x \in U, \qquad y \in V, \qquad U \cap V = \varnothing .$$

Since an open set containing a point is an open neighbourhood of it
([[def-neighbourhood-top]]), the condition reads: distinct points have disjoint
open neighbourhoods. Nothing is asserted about points that are equal, and the
condition is vacuous for a space with at most one point, so every such space is
Hausdorff.

**Every metrizable space is Hausdorff.** This is not proved here, because it is
already discharged: [[def-metrizable-space]] records it among the two things
every metrizable space has, deriving it from
[[thm-metric-hausdorff-separation]], which separates $p \ne q$ in a metric space
by the disjoint open balls $B(p,r)$ and $B(q,r)$ with $r = d(p,q)/2 > 0$. In
particular $\mathbb{R}$ with its usual topology, every $\mathbb{R}^n$, and every
subspace of a metrizable space are Hausdorff.

**Not every space is Hausdorff.** The indiscrete topology
$\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{ind}} = \{\varnothing, X\}$ on a set $X = \{a,b\}$ with
$a \ne b$ ([[def-standard-topologies]]) is not: the only open set containing $a$
is $X$, the only one containing $b$ is $X$, and $X \cap X = X \ne \varnothing$.
This is the same two-point space that [[def-metrizable-space]] uses to exhibit a
topology induced by no metric, and the reason is the same one: failure of the
Hausdorff condition is an obstruction to metrizability.

**Being Hausdorff is a topological property** ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]).
If $h : X \to Z$ is a homeomorphism and $X$ is Hausdorff, then for $z \ne z'$ in
$Z$ the points $h^{-1}(z)$ and $h^{-1}(z')$ are distinct, so they have disjoint
open $U, V$; the images $h[U]$ and $h[V]$ are open, disjoint, and contain $z$ and
$z'$ respectively, a homeomorphism carrying the open sets of one space
bijectively onto those of the other. So no space homeomorphic to a Hausdorff
space fails the condition.

**Scope of this item.** Only the definition, the metrizable case and the
two-point failure are recorded here, because that is all this page uses. The
Hausdorff condition is one of a graded family of separation axioms; that family,
its ordering, and the questions of which of its members are hereditary or
preserved by products, are not available at this point in the reading order and
nothing here anticipates them. What this page does use is a single negative
result: a quotient of a Hausdorff space need not be Hausdorff, which is recorded
below as a false statement and witnessed on the companion page.

## Remarks

- **The condition is about pairs of points, not about single points.** It says
  nothing about whether singletons are closed, and it is not equivalent to that
  weaker condition; the two are distinct members of the separation family, and
  the distinction is not developed here.

- **What the Hausdorff condition buys, in the one place this page needs it.**
  Separation of distinct points by disjoint open sets is exactly what a quotient
  map can destroy: identifying points of a Hausdorff space can leave two classes
  every pair of whose open neighbourhoods meet, and the companion page exhibits
  such a quotient of a metrizable space. Nothing weaker than an explicit witness
  settles that, since the condition is a statement about all pairs of open sets.

- **The name.** Hausdorff's own 1914 axiom system for a topological space
  included this condition, so "topological space" once meant what is now called a
  Hausdorff space; this library follows the modern convention in which
  [[def-topological-space]] assumes no separation at all and every separation
  hypothesis is stated where it is used.
