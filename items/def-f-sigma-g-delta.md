## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with open and closed sets as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

- $A$ is an **$F_\sigma$ set** when there is a sequence $(F_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$
  of closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ with
  $$A \;=\; \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} F_n .$$
- $A$ is a **$G_\delta$ set** when there is a sequence $(V_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$
  of open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ with
  $$A \;=\; \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} V_n .$$

The letters are the traditional ones: $F$ for *fermé* with $\sigma$ for *somme*,
$G$ for *Gebiet* with $\delta$ for *Durchschnitt*.

**The two classes are exchanged by complementation.** $A$ is $F_\sigma$ if and
only if $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ is $G_\delta$. If $A = \bigcup_n F_n$ with each
$F_n$ closed, then $\mathbb{R} \setminus A = \bigcap_n (\mathbb{R} \setminus F_n)$
by De Morgan, and each $\mathbb{R} \setminus F_n$ is open by the definition of
closedness ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]); the converse is the same computation
read backwards, using that the complement of an open set is closed, which is
again [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

**Every closed set is $F_\sigma$ and every open set is $G_\delta$**, by the
constant sequence $F_n := A$, respectively $V_n := A$. As with
[[def-nowhere-dense-meager]], an at most countable family ([[def-countable]]) may
always be presented as a sequence: a finite list $F_0, \dots, F_m$ of closed sets
is extended by $F_n := F_m$ for $n > m$, and a finite list of open sets likewise,
so nothing is lost by indexing over $\mathbb{N}$.

## Remarks

- **The classes are genuinely larger than the closed and the open sets.**
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is $F_\sigma$ and is neither open nor closed, and the irrationals
  are $G_\delta$ and neither open nor closed; both computations are in
  [[cor-q-is-meager-and-not-g-delta]]. That $\mathbb{Q}$ is not also $G_\delta$
  is the first genuinely hard fact about these classes and needs the Baire
  category theorem ([[thm-baire-category-r]]).

- **Why the algebra of open sets is not enough.** [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]
  gives that a *finite* intersection of open sets is open and a *finite* union of
  closed sets is closed. The definitions above are exactly what one gets by
  relaxing "finite" to "countable" once, and the point of the whole notion is
  that the relaxation is proper: a countable intersection of open sets need not
  be open, which is [[cex-intersection-of-shrinking-intervals-not-open]].

- **Nothing here is a measure-theoretic notion.** $F_\sigma$ and $G_\delta$ are
  defined from the topology of $\mathbb{R}$ alone and are used on this page to
  say precisely how far $\mathbb{Q}$ and its complement sit from being closed or
  open. They cut across [[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]] completely:
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is $F_\sigma$ and has measure zero
  ([[lem-countable-sets-are-null]]), while the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set is
  closed, hence $F_\sigma$, and does not
  ([[thm-fat-cantor-set-has-positive-measure]]).
