## Statement

Every at most countable set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-countable]]) has
measure zero ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

The cover is explicit: the $k$-th point of a listing of $A$ is put inside an
interval of length $\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-k-1}$, and the lengths sum to
$\varepsilon$ by [[thm-geometric-series]]. **No choice principle is used**: a
listing of $A$ is a single object, fixed once ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]]),
and everything after that is a formula in $k$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An at most countable set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a real $\varepsilon > 0$. Throughout, $\theta := 2^{-1}$.

[L1] $A$ is null when for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there are sequences $(a_k)$, $(b_k)$ with $a_k \le b_k$, $A \subseteq \bigcup_k [a_k,b_k]$, and $\sum_{k<n}(b_k - a_k) \le \varepsilon$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

[L2] $[c,d] = \{\, x : c \le x \le d \,\}$ has length $d - c$ when $c \le d$, and $[c,c] = \{c\}$ has length $0$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L3] A nonempty at most countable set admits a surjection $s : \mathbb{N} \to A$ ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]], [[def-countable]]).

[L4] Powers and the geometric series: $\theta^0 = 1$, $\theta^{k+1} = \theta^k\theta$, $\theta^k > 0$, and $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\theta^k = 2$ for $\theta = 2^{-1}$; a series of nonnegative terms has all its partial sums at most its sum ([[def-integer-power]], [[thm-geometric-series]], [[def-series]], [[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]]).

[L5] Finite sums: scaling by a constant, and $\sum_{k<n} 0 = 0$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L6] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 > 0$, $4 > 0$ and $t \cdot 4^{-1} > 0$ for $t > 0$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve an inequality ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let the real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. If $A = \varnothing$, the constant sequences $a_k := 0$ and $b_k := 0$ satisfy $A \subseteq \bigcup_k [0,0]$ vacuously and $\sum_{k<n}(b_k - a_k) = 0 \le \varepsilon$ for every $n$ by [L5], so the condition of [L1] holds at this $\varepsilon$. Assume from now on that $A \ne \varnothing$ and, by [L3], fix a surjection $s : \mathbb{N} \to A$. [given, L1, L2, L3, L5, choose]

2.1 Put $\delta_k := \varepsilon \cdot 4^{-1} \cdot \theta^{k}$, a positive real by [L4] and [L6], and $a_k := s(k) - \delta_k$, $b_k := s(k) + \delta_k$; then $a_k \le b_k$ and $s(k) \in [a_k,b_k]$ by [L6], so $A = \{\, s(k) : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\} \subseteq \bigcup_k [a_k, b_k]$ by step 1.1. The length of $[a_k,b_k]$ is $b_k - a_k = 2\delta_k = \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} \cdot \theta^{k}$ by [L2] and [L6]. [step 1.1, L2, L4, L6]

3.1 For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $\sum_{k<n}(b_k - a_k) = \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} \sum_{k<n}\theta^{k} \le \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} \cdot 2 = \varepsilon$, using scaling from [L5] and the bound on the partial sums of the geometric series from [L4]. [step 2.1, L4, L5, L6]

4.1 So for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the sequences of step 2.1 cover $A$ with all partial total lengths at most $\varepsilon$, which by [L1] is exactly the statement that $A$ has measure zero; the empty case was settled in step 1.1. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 3.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Indexing.** Sequences here start at $k = 0$, and the first interval has
  length $\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$, not $\varepsilon$. The total is
  $\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} \sum_{k \ge 0} 2^{-k} = \varepsilon$ exactly, so the
  cover is as tight as the definition allows and nothing is wasted at the first
  index.

- **Repetitions are harmless.** A surjection $s$ may repeat values, and a finite
  set is covered by infinitely many intervals, most of them redundant. This is
  why the listing form of countability ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]])
  is the convenient one: no injectivity and no case split between the finite and
  the countably infinite case is needed.

- **The converse fails badly.** The Cantor set is uncountable and null
  ([[thm-cantor-set-properties]]), so "null" is very far from "countable"; and
  the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set is uncountable and not null
  ([[thm-fat-cantor-set-has-positive-measure]]), so cardinality decides nothing
  either way.

- **Density decides nothing either.** $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable, hence null, and
  is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[cex-dense-set-of-measure-zero]]); a null set may
  therefore meet every interval.
