## Statement

Let $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be order-convex ([[def-interval]]) and let
$f : I \to \mathbb{R}$ be monotone ([[def-monotone-function]]). Then the set

$$D \;:=\; \{\, c \in I : f \text{ is discontinuous at } c \,\}$$

([[def-classification-of-discontinuities]]) is **at most countable**
([[def-countable]]).

More precisely, the proof exhibits an injection $J : D \to \mathbb{N}$
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]) built from one fixed enumeration of the
rationals: at a discontinuity $c$ interior to $I$ the value $J(c)$ is read off
the **least index** of a rational lying in the gap
$\bigl(\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x),\ \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)\bigr)$, which is a
nonempty open interval by [[thm-monotone-discontinuities-are-jumps]]. The map
$J$ is therefore determined by $f$ and by the fixed enumeration, and **no choice
principle is used**: least indices are canonical by
[[thm-well-ordering-principle]], and nothing anywhere in the proof is selected
without being determined.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An order-convex $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a monotone $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$; and $\mathbb{Q}$ denotes the canonical copy of the rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$.

[A1] $I$ is order-convex: $x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$ imply $z \in I$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L1] A nondecreasing $f$ on an order-convex $I$ has, at every $c \in I$, each well-posed one-sided limit; and if both $I^{-} = I \cap (-\infty,c)$ and $I^{+} = I \cap (c,\infty)$ are nonempty then $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) = \sup\{f(x) : x \in I, x < c\}$ and $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x) = \inf\{f(x) : x \in I, x > c\}$ ([[thm-monotone-one-sided-limits-exist]]).

[L2] For a nondecreasing $f$ on an order-convex $I$ and a point $c$ with both $I^{-}$ and $I^{+}$ nonempty, $f$ is discontinuous at $c$ if and only if $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) < \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$ ([[thm-monotone-discontinuities-are-jumps]]).

[L3] $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-rationals-countable]]) and the map $q \mapsto \hat q$ embeds $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ injectively ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), so composing a bijection $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$ with that embedding gives a bijection $e : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ onto the canonical copy of the rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$; and strictly between any two distinct reals there lies a point of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]], [[def-equinumerous]], [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L4] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L5] Every subset of $\mathbb{N}$ is at most countable, and a set in bijection with an at most countable set is at most countable ([[lem-subset-of-countable]], [[def-countable]], [[def-equinumerous]], [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L6] $f$ is discontinuous at $c$ exactly when it is not continuous there, and $|(-f)(x) - (-f)(c)| = |f(x) - f(c)|$, so $f$ and $-f$ have exactly the same points of discontinuity ([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-monotone-function]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 It is enough to treat a nondecreasing $f$: if $f$ is nonincreasing then $-f$ is nondecreasing and has the same discontinuity set, so the conclusion for $-f$ is the conclusion for $f$. Assume from here on that $f$ is nondecreasing. [L6]

1.2 Fix once and for all a bijection $e : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$; everything below is defined in terms of $f$, $I$ and this one function. [L3, choose]

1.3 Call $c \in I$ **interior** when both $I^{-}$ and $I^{+}$ are nonempty, and write $D_{0}$ for the set of interior points of $I$ at which $f$ is discontinuous. A point of $I$ that is not interior has $I^{-} = \varnothing$, and is then a least element of $I$, or $I^{+} = \varnothing$, and is then a greatest element of $I$; a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has at most one least and at most one greatest element, so $D \setminus D_{0}$ has at most two elements. [A1]

2.1 For $c \in D_{0}$ put $L^{-}(c) := \lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x)$ and $L^{+}(c) := \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$, both of which exist, and note $L^{-}(c) < L^{+}(c)$. [step 1.3, L1, L2]

2.2 Let $c, c' \in D_{0}$ with $c < c'$. Take $t := e(k)$ for the least $k$ with $c < e(k) < c'$, which exists because a point of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ lies strictly between $c$ and $c'$; then $t \in I$, since $c, c' \in I$ and $I$ is order-convex. [step 1.3, A1, L3, L4]

3.1 For $c \in D_{0}$ the set $K(c) := \{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : L^{-}(c) < e(k) < L^{+}(c) \,\}$ is nonempty, since a point of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ lies strictly between the two distinct reals $L^{-}(c)$ and $L^{+}(c)$ and $e$ is onto $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$; so $j(c) := \min K(c)$ is a well-defined natural number, determined by $c$, $f$ and $e$ alone. [step 2.1, L3, L4]

3.2 With $c < t < c'$ as in step 2.2: $L^{+}(c) = \inf\{f(x) : x \in I, x > c\} \le f(t)$ because $t$ is one of the points in that set, and $f(t) \le \sup\{f(x) : x \in I, x < c'\} = L^{-}(c')$ for the same reason on the other side. Hence $L^{+}(c) \le L^{-}(c')$. [step 2.2, L1]

4.1 The two open intervals $(L^{-}(c), L^{+}(c))$ and $(L^{-}(c'), L^{+}(c'))$ are therefore disjoint, so no point of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ lies in both, so $e(j(c)) \ne e(j(c'))$ and hence $j(c) \ne j(c')$. Since $c < c'$ was an arbitrary pair of distinct elements of $D_{0}$, the map $j : D_{0} \to \mathbb{N}$ is injective. [step 3.1, step 3.2]

5.1 Define $J : D \to \mathbb{N}$ by $J(c) := 2\,j(c) + 1$ for $c \in D_{0}$; $J(c) := 0$ if $c \in D \setminus D_{0}$ is a least element of $I$; and $J(c) := 2$ if $c \in D \setminus D_{0}$ is a greatest element of $I$ and not a least one. Then $J$ is injective: it is injective on $D_{0}$ by step 4.1, it separates the at most two points of $D \setminus D_{0}$ from each other, and its values on $D_{0}$ are odd while its values off $D_{0}$ are even. [step 1.3, step 4.1, construct]

6.1 Consequently $J$ is a bijection from $D$ onto the subset $J[D] \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, which is at most countable; countability transfers along that bijection, so $D$ is at most countable. [step 5.1, L5] ∎

## Remarks

- **The bound is attained.** Froda's theorem gives no better bound than *at most countable*, and none is available: for every at most countable $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ there is a bounded nondecreasing function on $\mathbb{R}$ whose discontinuity set is exactly $E$ ([[thm-monotone-with-prescribed-discontinuity-set]]). Taking $E = \mathbb{Q}$ gives a nondecreasing function discontinuous at every rational and continuous at every irrational.

- **What the choice-freedom rests on.** Two canonical selections, and nothing else: one fixed bijection $e : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$, produced by [[thm-rationals-countable]], whose own proof spends no choice principle; and the least element of a nonempty set of naturals ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]). Replacing "least index" by "some index" would turn step 3.1 into an application of a choice principle over the possibly uncountable index set $D_{0}$.

- **Monotonicity is doing all the work, not continuity of anything.** The only property of $f$ used after step 1.1 is the inequality $L^{+}(c) \le L^{-}(c')$ of step 3.2, which says that the gaps opened by distinct discontinuities are laid out in the same order as the discontinuities themselves and therefore do not overlap. A function that is not monotone can be discontinuous everywhere ([[thm-dirichlet-and-thomae-continuity-sets]]).
