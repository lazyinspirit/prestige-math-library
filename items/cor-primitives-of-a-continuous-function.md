## Statement

Let $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be order-convex with at least two elements
([[def-interval]]) and let $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $I$
([[def-continuity-real]]). Call $G : I \to \mathbb{R}$ a **primitive of $f$ on
$I$** when $G$ is differentiable at every point of $I$ as a function on $I$ with
$G' = f$ there ([[def-derivative]]). Then:

1. **Existence.** Fix $c_0 \in I$. The function
   $$F : I \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad F(x) \;:=\; \int_{c_0}^x f$$
   is defined at every $x \in I$ ([[def-oriented-integral]],
   [[def-the-integral-function]]) and is a primitive of $f$ on $I$.
2. **Uniqueness up to a constant.** If $G_1$ and $G_2$ are primitives of $f$ on
   $I$ then there is a real $k$ with $G_1(x) = G_2(x) + k$ for every $x \in I$.
3. **Evaluation.** If $a, b \in I$ with $a < b$ and $G$ is any primitive of $f$
   on $I$, then
   $$\int_a^b f \;=\; G(b) - G(a) .$$

**The scope is exactly the continuous case, and that is not a limitation of the
proof.** An integrable function need not have a primitive, and a function with a
primitive need not be integrable; this corollary is precisely the intersection
where both fundamental theorems apply, and both witnesses are on the companion
page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An order-convex $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ with at least two elements, a continuous $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$, a base point $c_0 \in I$, and a real $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] A continuous function on a closed bounded interval with distinct endpoints is integrable there; a restriction of a continuous function is continuous ([[thm-continuous-implies-integrable]], [[def-continuity-real]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L2] Order-convexity: if $p, q \in I$ then every real between $p$ and $q$ lies in $I$, so the closed interval with endpoints $p$ and $q$ is contained in $I$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L3] $\int_p^p u = 0$, $\int_q^p u = -\int_p^q u$, and for $u$ integrable on a closed bounded interval containing $p,q,r$ one has $\int_p^q u + \int_q^r u = \int_p^r u$ ([[def-oriented-integral]], [[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]], claim 3).

[L4] First fundamental theorem: if $u$ is integrable on $[p,q]$ with $p<q$ and continuous at $c \in [p,q]$, then $x \mapsto \int_p^x u$ has derivative $u(c)$ at $c$ as a function on $[p,q]$; written out, for every real $\varepsilon>0$ there is a real $\delta>0$ with $\bigl|\bigl(\int_p^x u - \int_p^c u\bigr)/(x-c) - u(c)\bigr| < \varepsilon$ for every $x \in [p,q]$ with $0<|x-c|<\delta$ ([[thm-ftc-first-part]], [[def-derivative]], [[def-function-limit]]).

[L5] Second fundamental theorem: if $H$ is differentiable at every point of $[p,q]$ with $H'$ integrable there, then $\int_p^q H' = H(q)-H(p)$ ([[thm-ftc-second-part]]).

[L6] If $u$ is continuous on an order-convex $I$ and differentiable with $u' = 0$ at every interior point of $I$, then $u$ is constant on $I$ ([[cor-zero-derivative-implies-constant]]).

[L7] A differentiable function is continuous, and the restriction of a function differentiable at $c$ to a subset still having $c$ as a limit point is differentiable at $c$ with the same derivative; every point of a nondegenerate interval is a limit point of it ([[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]], [[def-derivative]], [[def-interval]]).

[L8] Ordered-field arithmetic and minima of two reals: the order is total and transitive, and $\min\{s,t\}$ is a real that is $\le$ both ([[def-max-min]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **$F$ is defined.** For $x \in I$ the closed interval with endpoints $c_0$ and $x$ lies in $I$ by [L2], $f$ is continuous there, hence integrable when $x \ne c_0$ by [L1], and $\int_{c_0}^{c_0} f = 0$ by [L3]; so $F(x)$ names a real for every $x \in I$. [given, L1, L2, L3]

1.2 **A closed neighbourhood inside $I$.** Fix $c \in I$. If some element of $I$ is $< c$, choose $u \in I$ with $u < c$; otherwise put $u := c$. If some element of $I$ is $> c$, choose $v \in I$ with $v > c$; otherwise put $v := c$. Not both $u = c$ and $v = c$, since $I$ would then have $c$ as its only element; so $u < v$, and $[u,v] \subseteq I$ by [L2]. [given, L2, choose]

1.3 **Claim 2.** Let $G_1, G_2$ be primitives of $f$ on $I$ and put $u := G_1 - G_2$. Then $u$ is differentiable at every point of $I$ with $u' = f - f = 0$ there, in particular at every interior point of $I$, and $u$ is continuous on $I$ by [L7]; so [L6] gives a real $k$ with $u \equiv k$. [L6, L7]

2.1 Put $\eta := \min\{\,c-u,\ v-c\,\}$ if $u<c$ and $c<v$, $\eta := v-c$ if $u = c$, and $\eta := c-u$ if $v = c$; in every case $\eta > 0$. [step 1.2, L8, construct]

2.2 $f$ is integrable on $[u,v]$ by [L1], and for $x \in [u,v]$, [L3] applied to the points $c_0, u, x$ inside the closed interval with endpoints $\min\{c_0,u\}$ and $\max\{c_0,v\}$, which lies in $I$ by [L2], gives $F(x) = F(u) + \int_u^x f$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1, L2, L3]

3.1 **Every point of $I$ within $\eta$ of $c$ lies in $[u,v]$.** Let $x \in I$ with $|x-c| < \eta$. If $x < c$ then $I$ has an element below $c$, so $u < c$ and $\eta \le c-u$, whence $x > c-\eta \ge u$. If $x > c$ then symmetrically $x < c+\eta \le v$. And $u \le c \le v$ covers $x = c$. So $u \le x \le v$. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L8]

3.2 Hence for $x \in [u,v]$ with $x \ne c$, $\bigl(F(x)-F(c)\bigr)/(x-c) = \bigl(\int_u^x f - \int_u^c f\bigr)/(x-c)$, the constant $F(u)$ cancelling. [step 2.2, algebra]

3.3 By [L4] applied on $[u,v]$ at the point $c$, fix a real $\delta > 0$ with $\bigl|\bigl(\int_u^x f - \int_u^c f\bigr)/(x-c) - f(c)\bigr| < \varepsilon$ for every $x \in [u,v]$ with $0<|x-c|<\delta$, and put $\delta' := \min\{\delta,\eta\} > 0$. [step 2.2, given, L1, L4, L8, choose]

4.1 Every $x \in I$ with $0 < |x-c| < \delta'$ lies in $[u,v]$ by step 3.1, so by step 3.2 and step 3.3, $\bigl|\bigl(F(x)-F(c)\bigr)/(x-c) - f(c)\bigr| < \varepsilon$. [step 3.1, step 3.2, step 3.3]

5.1 As $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary and $c$ is a limit point of $I$ by [L7], $F$ is differentiable at $c$ with $F'(c) = f(c)$; since $c \in I$ was arbitrary, $F$ is a primitive of $f$ on $I$, which is claim 1. [step 1.2, step 4.1, L7]

6.1 **Claim 3.** Let $a<b$ in $I$ and let $G$ be a primitive of $f$ on $I$. Then $[a,b] \subseteq I$ by [L2], the restriction of $G$ to $[a,b]$ is differentiable at every point of $[a,b]$ with derivative $f$ there by [L7], and $f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ by [L1]; so [L5] gives $\int_a^b f = G(b)-G(a)$. [L1, L2, L5, L7] ∎

## Remarks

- **Steps 1.2, 2.1 and 3.1 are the only work beyond citing the two fundamental theorems.** [[thm-ftc-first-part]] is stated on a closed bounded interval, while $I$ here may be open, half-open or unbounded, so the derivative it produces is the derivative of a *restriction*. What those steps supply is a closed subinterval $[u,v] \subseteq I$ that contains all points of $I$ within $\eta$ of $c$, after which the difference quotients of $F$ and of the restriction agree on a punctured neighbourhood and the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ statement transfers verbatim.

- **"Two primitives differ by a constant" is not re-minted here.** [[cor-zero-derivative-implies-constant]] already states exactly that, in its second clause, for functions with equal derivatives on an order-convex domain; claim 2 is that statement applied to $G_1 - G_2$.

- **Order-convexity of $I$ is essential to claim 2 and harmless elsewhere.** On a domain in two pieces a function may be constant on each with different constants, which is why [[cor-zero-derivative-implies-constant]] carries the same hypothesis. Claims 1 and 3 use it only to know that closed subintervals spanned by points of $I$ lie in $I$.

- **Forward references, orientation only.** The two witnesses bounding the scope of this corollary are [[cex-an-integrable-function-with-no-primitive]] and [[cex-a-function-with-a-primitive-that-is-not-integrable]] on the companion page; nothing above depends on either.
