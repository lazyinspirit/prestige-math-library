## Statement

For each $k \in \mathbb{N}$ let $I_k = [a_k, b_k]$ be a closed bounded interval
with $a_k \le b_k$ ([[def-interval]]), and suppose the family is **nested**:

$$I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k \qquad (k \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Write $\ell_k = b_k - a_k \ge 0$ for the length of $I_k$. Then:

1. $\displaystyle\bigcap_{k \in \mathbb{N}} I_k$ is **nonempty**. More precisely,
   with $a = \sup\{a_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$ and
   $b = \inf\{b_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$, both of which exist, one has $a \le b$
   and $$\bigcap_{k \in \mathbb{N}} I_k = [a, b].$$
2. $\displaystyle\bigcap_{k \in \mathbb{N}} I_k$ is a **single point** if and only
   if $\ell_k \to 0$ ([[def-real-limit]]).

Every hypothesis is load bearing. Dropping closedness makes the intersection
empty; dropping boundedness does the same; and dropping nonemptiness of the
individual intervals is vacuously fatal.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Closed bounded intervals $I_k = [a_k, b_k]$ with $a_k \le b_k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and $I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k$ for every $k$; the sequences $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ of reals ([[def-sequence]]); their ranges $A = \{a_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$ and $B = \{b_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$, both nonempty; and $\ell_k = b_k - a_k$.

[L1] Closed bounded intervals: $[a,b] = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : a \le x \le b\}$; it is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, it is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$, it has two distinct elements $a$ and $b$ when $a < b$, and its length is $b - a$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L2] Least-upper-bound property and uniqueness: a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ bounded above has a unique supremum; the supremum is an upper bound and is $\le$ every upper bound ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L3] Greatest-lower-bound property and uniqueness: a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ bounded below has a unique infimum; the infimum is a lower bound and is $\ge$ every lower bound ([[thm-infimum-property]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L4] Monotone sequences, and the fact that consecutive comparisons suffice: $x_k \le x_{k+1}$ for all $k$ makes $(x_k)$ nondecreasing, and $x_{k+1} \le x_k$ for all $k$ makes it nonincreasing ([[def-monotone-sequence]]).

[L5] Monotone convergence: a nondecreasing sequence whose range is bounded above converges to the supremum of its range, and a nonincreasing sequence whose range is bounded below converges to the infimum ([[thm-monotone-convergence]]).

[L6] Algebra of limits: if $u_k \to u$ and $v_k \to v$ then $u_k - v_k \to u - v$ ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]]).

[L7] A sequence of reals has at most one limit ([[lem-limit-unique]]).

[L8] Bounded above and bounded below, for a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-bounded-set]]).

[L9] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total and transitive, so any two indices $k, l$ admit an index $m$ with $k \le m$ and $l \le m$, namely the larger of the two ([[def-nat-order]], [[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Nestedness read on the endpoints: since $a_{k+1} \le b_{k+1}$, both $a_{k+1}$ and $b_{k+1}$ lie in $I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k$, so $a_k \le a_{k+1}$ and $b_{k+1} \le b_k$ for every $k$. [given, L1]

2.1 Hence $(a_k)$ is nondecreasing and $(b_k)$ is nonincreasing. [step 1.1, L4]

3.1 For all indices $k$ and $l$: choosing $m$ with $k \le m$ and $l \le m$ gives $a_k \le a_m \le b_m \le b_l$, so $a_k \le b_l$. [step 2.1, given, L9]

4.1 Every $b_l$ is therefore an upper bound of $A$ and every $a_k$ a lower bound of $B$; both sets are nonempty, so $a := \sup A$ and $b := \inf B$ exist and are unique. [step 3.1, L2, L3, L8]

5.1 $a \le b$: each $b_l$ is an upper bound of $A$, so $a \le b_l$ for every $l$ by leastness of the supremum; thus $a$ is a lower bound of $B$, and $a \le b$ by greatestness of the infimum. [step 4.1, L2, L3]

5.2 By monotone convergence, $a_k \to a$ and $b_k \to b$. [step 2.1, step 4.1, L5]

5.3 The intersection is exactly $[a,b]$: a real $x$ lies in every $I_k$ exactly when $a_k \le x \le b_k$ for every $k$, that is exactly when $x$ is an upper bound of $A$ and a lower bound of $B$, and by leastness of $a$ and greatestness of $b$ that holds exactly when $a \le x \le b$. [step 4.1, L1, L2, L3]

6.1 $\ell_k = b_k - a_k \to b - a$ by the algebra of limits. [step 5.2, L6]

6.2 Since $a \le b$, the interval $[a,b]$ is nonempty, so the intersection is nonempty; together with step 5.3 this is claim 1. [step 5.1, step 5.3, L1]

7.1 If $\ell_k \to 0$ then $b - a = 0$ by uniqueness of limits, so $a = b$ and the intersection is $[a,a] = \{a\}$, a single point. [step 5.3, step 6.1, L1, L7]

7.2 Conversely, if the intersection is a single point then $a = b$: it equals $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, and $a < b$ would give the two distinct elements $a$ and $b$. Hence $b - a = 0$ and $\ell_k \to 0$ by step 6.1. [step 5.1, step 5.3, step 6.1, L1]

8.1 Claim 1 is step 6.2 and claim 2 is the pair of implications in steps 7.1 and 7.2, so a nested sequence of nonempty closed bounded intervals has nonempty intersection, equal to $[a,b]$, and that intersection is a single point exactly when the lengths tend to $0$. [step 6.2, step 7.1, step 7.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **No Archimedean input is needed.** The lengths are handled entirely by the
  algebra of limits and the uniqueness of limits: $\ell_k$ always converges, to
  $b - a$, and the two directions of claim 2 are then the two directions of
  "$b - a = 0$". A proof that instead argues "if $b - a > 0$ then some $\ell_k$
  is smaller" does need the Archimedean property
  ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]]), and it is avoidable, so it is avoided.

- **Nestedness gives more than it is usually stated to give.** The intersection
  is not merely nonempty; it is the closed interval $[a,b]$, and $a$ and $b$ are
  the limits of the endpoint sequences. The single-point case is exactly the case
  in which those two limits agree, and that is what makes the nested interval
  property usable as a *construction* of a real number, as in
  [[ex-nested-intervals-single-point]].

- **This is one of the standard equivalents of completeness.** Nested intervals
  together with the Archimedean property imply the least-upper-bound property, so
  the implication proved here is not reversible for free: it is half of an
  equivalence whose other half needs the Archimedean hypothesis separately.
  [[rem-completeness-routes]] records where this library stands on those routes.

- **The witnesses for the two deleted hypotheses** are
  [[cex-nested-open-intervals-empty]], which keeps boundedness and drops
  closedness, and [[cex-nested-unbounded-closed-empty]], which keeps closedness
  and drops boundedness. Neither is used above; each shows that the corresponding
  hypothesis cannot be removed.
