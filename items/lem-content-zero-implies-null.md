## Statement

If $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ has content zero
([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]) then $A$ has measure zero.

The converse is false in general, and true for compact sets
([[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]]); the witness for its failure is named in
the remarks below.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ of content zero and a real $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] $A$ has content zero when for every real $\eta > 0$ there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and reals $a_0 \le b_0, \dots, a_n \le b_n$ with $A \subseteq \bigcup_{j \le n}[a_j,b_j]$ and $\sum_{j \le n}(b_j - a_j) \le \eta$; $A$ is null when for every real $\eta > 0$ there are sequences with the analogous properties and $\sum_{k<i}(b_k - a_k) \le \eta$ for every $i \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

[L2] $[c,c] = \{c\}$ is an interval of length $0$, and $[c,d]$ has length $d - c \ge 0$ for $c \le d$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L3] Finite sums: $\sum_{k<i} t_k = \sum_{k<n+1} t_k + \sum_{k=n+1}^{i-1} t_k$ for $n + 1 \le i$, a sum of nonnegative terms is nonnegative and is monotone in the number of nonnegative terms adjoined, and $\sum_{k<i} t_k \le \sum_{k<n+1} t_k$ whenever $i \le n+1$ and the terms are nonnegative ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[def-series]]).

[L4] Ordered-field arithmetic: adding a nonnegative quantity does not decrease a value, and the order is transitive ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let the real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given; since $A$ has content zero, [L1] supplies $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and reals $a_0 \le b_0, \dots, a_n \le b_n$ with $A \subseteq \bigcup_{j \le n}[a_j,b_j]$ and $\sum_{j \le n}(b_j - a_j) \le \varepsilon$. [given, L1, choose]

2.1 Extend the finite list to sequences by putting $a_k := 0$ and $b_k := 0$ for $k > n$; then $a_k \le b_k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, the added intervals $[0,0]$ have length $0$ by [L2], and $A \subseteq \bigcup_{j \le n}[a_j,b_j] \subseteq \bigcup_{k \in \mathbb{N}}[a_k,b_k]$. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 For every $i \in \mathbb{N}$ one has $\sum_{k<i}(b_k - a_k) \le \varepsilon$: all the terms are nonnegative by [L2], so for $i \le n+1$ the sum is at most $\sum_{k<n+1}(b_k - a_k) = \sum_{j \le n}(b_j - a_j) \le \varepsilon$ by [L3] and step 1.1, and for $i > n+1$ the sum equals $\sum_{k<n+1}(b_k - a_k)$ plus a sum of terms all equal to $0$, hence is again at most $\varepsilon$, by [L3] and [L4]. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L2, L3, L4]

4.1 So for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a sequence of closed intervals covering $A$ with every partial total length at most $\varepsilon$, which by [L1] is exactly the statement that $A$ has measure zero. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **All that is used is that a finite list can be padded.** The definition of
  measure zero asks for a sequence, and a finite family becomes one at the cost
  of degenerate intervals, which are intervals of length $0$
  ([[def-interval]]). No estimate is involved and no completeness of $\mathbb{R}$
  is used.

- **The implication is strict.** $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$ is null and bounded and
  does not have content zero ([[fs-null-implies-content-zero]],
  [[cex-null-set-not-of-content-zero]]), so the two notions are genuinely
  different even for bounded sets. What closes the gap is compactness, not
  boundedness ([[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]]).
