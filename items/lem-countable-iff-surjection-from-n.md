## Statement

Let $A$ be a nonempty set. Then $A$ is at most countable ([[def-countable]]) if
and only if there is a surjection $s : \mathbb{N} \to A$
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

Moreover, from any such surjection an injection $A \to \mathbb{N}$ is obtained
explicitly, without any choice, by

$$j(a) := \min\{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : s(k) = a \,\}.$$

This is the working form of countability used everywhere below: to prove a
nonempty set countable it suffices to list its elements, repetitions and all.

**No choice principle is used.** The backward direction is where an appeal to
choice would be natural ("for each $a$ pick some $k$ with $s(k) = a$") and it is
avoided outright, because $\min$ is canonical: every nonempty set of naturals has
a *least* element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]), so $j(a)$ is determined by
$a$ and $s$ alone.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A nonempty set $A$. For $a \in A$ and a function $s : \mathbb{N} \to A$ write $s^{-1}(\{a\}) = \{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : s(k) = a \,\}$.

[L1] $A$ is at most countable when $A \approx n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ or $A \approx \mathbb{N}$; $A \approx 0 = \varnothing$ holds only for $A = \varnothing$ ([[def-countable]], [[def-natural-numbers]]).

[L2] Bijections, injections, surjections, images and the symmetry and transitivity of $\approx$; an injection is a bijection onto its image ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]], [[def-equinumerous]]).

[L3] Well-ordering: every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L4] Every subset of an at most countable set is at most countable ([[lem-subset-of-countable]]).

[L5] For naturals, $k \in n \iff k < n$, so a natural number $n$ is the set $\{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : k < n \,\}$ of naturals below it; in particular $0 \in n$ whenever $n \ne 0$ ([[lem-nat-order-is-membership]], proved earlier on this page from the additive order of [[def-nat-order]] on the von Neumann naturals of [[def-natural-numbers]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For the forward implication assume $A$ is at most countable; since $A \ne \varnothing$ we have $A \approx \mathbb{N}$, or $A \approx n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ne 0$, and in either case fix a bijection $\psi$ from $\mathbb{N}$, respectively from $n$, onto $A$. [assume-hyp, given, L1, L2]

1.2 For the converse implication assume a surjection $s : \mathbb{N} \to A$ is given. [assume-hyp]

2.1 If $\psi$ is defined on $\mathbb{N}$ it is itself a surjection $\mathbb{N} \to A$; if $\psi$ is defined on $n \ne 0$, then $0 \in n$ by [L5] and the function $s_\psi : \mathbb{N} \to A$ with $s_\psi(k) = \psi(k)$ for $k < n$ and $s_\psi(k) = \psi(0)$ for $k \ge n$ is a surjection, since every element of $A$ is $\psi(k)$ for some $k \in n$. In both cases a surjection $\mathbb{N} \to A$ exists. [step 1.1, L2, L5, construct]

2.2 For each $a \in A$ the set $s^{-1}(\{a\})$ is a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$, because $s$ is surjective, so [L3] provides its least element and $j(a) := \min s^{-1}(\{a\})$ defines a function $j : A \to \mathbb{N}$; no selection is made, since the least element is uniquely determined. [step 1.2, L3, construct]

3.1 $j$ is injective: if $j(a) = j(a') = k$ then $s(k) = a$ and $s(k) = a'$, because $j(a) \in s^{-1}(\{a\})$ and $j(a') \in s^{-1}(\{a'\})$, so $a = a'$. [step 2.2, L2]

4.1 Hence $j$ is a bijection of $A$ onto $j[A] \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, so $A \approx j[A]$; the subset $j[A]$ of the at most countable set $\mathbb{N}$ is at most countable by [L4], and transitivity of $\approx$ transfers this to $A$. [step 3.1, L1, L2, L4]

5.1 The forward implication is step 2.1 and the converse is step 4.1, so for nonempty $A$ countability and the existence of a surjection $\mathbb{N} \to A$ are equivalent, with $j$ of step 2.2 the promised injection $A \to \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, step 4.1] ∎

## Remarks

- The hypothesis $A \ne \varnothing$ cannot be dropped in the forward direction: $\varnothing$ is finite, hence at most countable, but no function $\mathbb{N} \to \varnothing$ exists at all. The converse direction needs no such hypothesis, since a surjection onto $A$ already forces $A \ne \varnothing$.

- Combining the two directions: a nonempty $A$ is at most countable if and only if $A \preceq \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-equinumerous]]). The forward direction of that reformulation is immediate, and the backward direction is step 4.1.

- The lemma is what licenses the informal phrase "enumerate $A$ as $a_0, a_1, a_2, \dots$, possibly with repetitions". Repetitions are exactly what distinguishes a surjection from a bijection, and allowing them is what makes the criterion easy to apply: the enumerations built in [[thm-product-of-countable]] and [[thm-countable-union-of-countable]] repeat.
