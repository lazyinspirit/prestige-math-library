## Statement

Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals, with partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$
([[def-series]]). Then $\sum a_k$ converges **if and only if**

$$\text{for every real } \varepsilon > 0 \text{ there is } N \in \mathbb{N} \text{ such that } \Big| \sum_{k=m+1}^{n} a_k \Big| < \varepsilon \text{ for all } n > m \ge N .$$

The block $\sum_{k=m+1}^{n} a_k$ is the finite sum $a_{m+1} + \dots + a_n$ of
[[def-finite-sum]], and it equals $s_{n+1} - s_{m+1}$.

This is the Cauchy criterion transported from sequences to series. Its value is
that it decides convergence without producing, or even naming, the sum.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(a_k)$ of reals with partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[L1] Splitting of finite sums: if $m' \le n'$ then $\sum_{k<n'} a_k = \sum_{k<m'} a_k + \sum_{k=m'}^{n'-1} a_k$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[L2] Every convergent sequence of reals is Cauchy ([[lem-convergent-implies-cauchy]]).

[L3] Every Cauchy sequence of reals converges ([[thm-cauchy-criterion-via-lub]]).

[L4] Cauchyness reads: for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with $|s_p - s_q| < \varepsilon$ for all $p, q \ge K$ ([[def-real-limit]]). Rational and real tolerances give the same condition, because every real $\varepsilon > 0$ exceeds some rational $1/n$ with $n \ge 1$ natural ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]]), and conversely every positive rational is a positive real.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For all naturals $m < n$, splitting $s_{n+1}$ at the index $m+1 \le n+1$ gives $s_{n+1} = s_{m+1} + \sum_{k=m+1}^{n} a_k$, hence $\sum_{k=m+1}^{n} a_k = s_{n+1} - s_{m+1}$. [L1, algebra]

1.2 Conversely, every pair $p > q \ge 1$ of naturals is of the form $p = n+1$, $q = m+1$ with $n = p - 1 > m = q - 1 \ge 0$. [given, algebra]

1.3 Suppose $\sum a_k$ converges, that is $(s_n)$ converges; then $(s_n)$ is Cauchy. [given, L2]

1.4 Suppose conversely that the stated condition holds, and let a rational $\varepsilon > 0$ be given; take $N$ for $\varepsilon$ as in the condition and put $K := N + 1$. [given, choose]

2.1 Let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given, choose a rational $\varepsilon' $ with $0 < \varepsilon' < \varepsilon$, and take $K$ for $\varepsilon'$ as in the Cauchy condition; put $N := K$. [step 1.3, L4, choose]

2.2 Let $p, q \ge K$. If $p = q$ then $|s_p - s_q| = 0 < \varepsilon$; otherwise one of them exceeds the other, and by symmetry we may take $p > q \ge K \ge 1$. [step 1.4, algebra]

3.1 For all $n > m \ge N$ one has $n + 1 > m + 1 \ge K$, so $\big|\sum_{k=m+1}^{n} a_k\big| = |s_{n+1} - s_{m+1}| < \varepsilon' < \varepsilon$, which is the stated condition. [step 2.1, step 1.1, L4]

3.2 Writing $p = n+1$ and $q = m+1$ gives $n > m$ and $m = q - 1 \ge K - 1 = N$, so the condition applies and $|s_p - s_q| = \big|\sum_{k=m+1}^{n} a_k\big| < \varepsilon$. [step 2.2, step 1.2, step 1.1, step 1.4]

4.1 So $(s_n)$ is Cauchy, hence converges, hence $\sum a_k$ converges. [step 2.2, step 3.2, L4, L3]

5.1 The two implications together are the stated equivalence. [step 3.1, step 4.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The criterion is stated over blocks, not over partial sums, on purpose.** In applications one estimates a run of consecutive terms $a_{m+1}, \dots, a_n$ directly; the translation into $|s_{n+1} - s_{m+1}|$ is step 1.1 and is done once here so that no later proof has to repeat it.

- **Taking $n = m+1$ recovers the term test.** The single-term block gives $|a_{m+1}| < \varepsilon$ for all $m \ge N$, which is $a_k \to 0$; so [[lem-nth-term-test]] is the weakest consequence of this criterion. The criterion is strictly stronger, since it constrains arbitrarily long blocks and not only single terms.
