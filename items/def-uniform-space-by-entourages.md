## Definition

Let $X$ be a set and write $\Delta_X=\{(x,x):x\in X\}$ for its diagonal ([[def-the-diagonal-of-a-space]]). For $E\subseteq X\times X$, put $E[x]:=\{y\in X:(x,y)\in E\}$, $E^{-1}:=\{(y,x):(x,y)\in E\}$, and $E\circ F:=\{(x,z):\text{some }y\text{ has }(x,y)\in E,(y,z)\in F\}$.

A **uniformity** on $X$ is a filter $\mathcal U$ on $X\times X$ ([[def-filter]]) such that:

- every $E\in\mathcal U$ contains $\Delta_X$;
- $E\in\mathcal U$ implies $E^{-1}\in\mathcal U$;
- for every $E\in\mathcal U$ there is $D\in\mathcal U$ with $D\circ D\subseteq E$.

Its members are **entourages**. A **uniform space** is a set equipped with a uniformity. The induced topology and its neighbourhoods are constructed in [[thm-uniformity-induces-a-topology]].
