## Definition

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]), with $\mathbb{R}$ ordered
as in [[def-real-order]] and [[def-complete-ordered-field]].

- $(x_k)$ **diverges to $+\infty$**, written $x_k \to +\infty$, when for every
  $M \in \mathbb{R}$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x_k > M$ for all
  $k \ge K$.
- $(x_k)$ **diverges to $-\infty$**, written $x_k \to -\infty$, when for every
  $M \in \mathbb{R}$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x_k < M$ for all
  $k \ge K$.

Equivalently, in the language of [[def-sequence]]: $x_k \to +\infty$ when the
property $x_k > M$ holds eventually, for every real $M$.

## Remarks

- **This is divergence, not convergence.** The symbols $+\infty$ and $-\infty$
  are **not real numbers**: $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
  ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and contains no element larger than every
  element of itself. Nothing above claims that $(x_k)$ has a limit in the sense
  of [[def-real-limit]], and nothing above defines an object named $+\infty$.
  The whole phrase "$x_k \to +\infty$" is a single abbreviation for the
  displayed condition, exactly as "$(x_k)$ is Cauchy" is an abbreviation for a
  condition and not a claim that some object called a Cauchy value exists.

- **A sequence diverging to $+\infty$ really does diverge.** Suppose
  $x_k \to +\infty$. Given any real $M$, there is $K$ with $x_k > M$ for all
  $k \ge K$; in particular $x_K > M$, so no real $M$ satisfies $x_k \le M$ for
  all $k$. Since $x_k \le |x_k|$ always ([[lem-of-abs-value]]), a bound
  $|x_k| \le M$ valid for all $k$ would give $x_k \le M$ for all $k$, which has
  just been excluded, so no such $M$ exists either. Thus
  $(x_k)$ is unbounded, and an unbounded sequence cannot converge, since
  convergent sequences are bounded ([[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]]). The
  same argument applies to $-\infty$. So the two notions never overlap: a
  sequence that diverges to $\pm\infty$ has no limit whatever.

- **Consequently $\lim_k x_k$ is not written here.** Many texts write
  $\lim_k x_k = +\infty$. This library does not, for the reason recorded in
  [[rem-sup-conventions]] about $\sup S = +\infty$: writing an equation whose
  right-hand side is not an element of $\mathbb{R}$ silently moves the discussion
  into the extended real line, a structure that is not a field, and every
  subsequent algebraic step then needs its own justification. In particular none
  of the rules of [[thm-algebra-of-limits]] may be applied to a divergence to
  $\pm\infty$; the familiar slogans "$\infty + \infty = \infty$" and
  "$\infty \cdot \infty = \infty$" are separate statements about this definition
  and would need separate proofs.

- **Testing against naturals suffices.** Since $\mathbb{R}$ is Archimedean
  ([[thm-of-archimedean]]), every real $M$ is below some canonical natural $n$,
  so the condition "for every real $M$" may equivalently be read as "for every
  natural $n \ge 1$"; the two formulations of $x_k \to +\infty$ agree.

- **Divergence to $+\infty$ is much stronger than divergence.** A sequence
  alternating between $1$ and $-1$ diverges ([[fs-bounded-implies-convergent]])
  but goes to neither $+\infty$ nor $-\infty$, since it is bounded. Divergence
  is the negation of convergence; divergence to $+\infty$ is a positive
  statement about growth.
