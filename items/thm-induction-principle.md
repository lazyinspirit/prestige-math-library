## Statement

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. If $0 \in S$ and $\sigma(n) \in S$ whenever $n \in S$, then $S = \mathbb{N}$. Equivalently (property form): if a property $P$ satisfies $P(0)$ and ($P(n) \Rightarrow P(\sigma(n))$) for all $n$, then $P(n)$ holds for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. This is the induction principle, the basis of proof by induction.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $\mathbb{N} = \omega$ is the smallest inductive set ([[def-inductive-set]], [[def-natural-numbers]], [[lem-omega-smallest-inductive]]); $0 = \varnothing$, $\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$.

[L1] $\omega$ is contained in every inductive set ([[lem-omega-smallest-inductive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Suppose $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ with $0 = \varnothing \in S$ and ($x \in S \Rightarrow \sigma(x) = x \cup \{x\} \in S$). [given]

2.1 Then $S$ contains $\varnothing$ and is closed under $x \mapsto x \cup \{x\}$, so $S$ is an inductive set. [step 1.1]

3.1 $\mathbb{N} = \omega \subseteq S$ because $\omega$ is a subset of every inductive set. [L1, step 2.1]

4.1 With $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ by hypothesis, $S = \mathbb{N}$. [step 3.1, given]

5.1 The property form is the set case with $S = \{n \in \mathbb{N} : P(n)\}$: $P(0)$ and $P(n) \Rightarrow P(\sigma(n))$ give $0 \in S$ and $\sigma$-closure, so $S = \mathbb{N}$, i.e. $P$ holds for all $n$; conversely the set form is the property form applied to $P(n) :\equiv n \in S$, so the two are equivalent. [step 4.1] ∎
