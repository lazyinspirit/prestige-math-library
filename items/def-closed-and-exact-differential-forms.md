## Definition

For the complex [[def-de-rham-cochain-complex]], put $Z^k(M)=\ker(d:\Omega^k(M)\to\Omega^{k+1}(M))$ and $B^k(M)=\operatorname{im}(d:\Omega^{k-1}(M)\to\Omega^k(M))$. A form is **closed** if it belongs to $Z^k$ and **exact** if it belongs to $B^k$.

If $\omega=d\eta$, then $d\omega=d^2\eta=0$ by [[thm-the-exterior-derivative-squares-to-zero]], so $B^k\subseteq Z^k$. In particular $B^0=0$, since $\Omega^{-1}=0$. The zero form is both closed and exact in every degree.
