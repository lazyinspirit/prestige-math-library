## Definition

Let $X$ be a set and let $R \subseteq X \times X$ be a binary relation on $X$.
Call $R$ **entire on $X$** when

$$\text{for every } x \in X \text{ there is } y \in X \text{ with } x \mathbin{R} y .$$

The **Axiom of Dependent Choice**, written $\mathrm{DC}$, is the following
statement.

> For every nonempty set $X$, every relation $R$ entire on $X$, and every
> $a \in X$, there is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to X$ ([[def-function]],
> [[def-natural-numbers]]) with
> $$x_0 = a \qquad \text{and} \qquad x_n \mathbin{R} x_{n+1} \ \text{ for every } n \in \mathbb{N}.$$

Here a sequence in $X$ means a function from $\mathbb{N}$ to $X$, not necessarily
a real-valued sequence. As everywhere in this library $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$, and the sequence is
indexed from $0$; the term $x_0$ is the prescribed starting point $a$ and every
later term is related to its predecessor.

**What DC adds to what came before.** [[def-choice-function]] and
[[def-axiom-of-choice]] select one element from each member of a family that is
fixed in advance, and [[def-countable-choice]] does the same for a family indexed
by $\mathbb{N}$. In both, the family is given before any selection is made. DC is
the principle needed when the $n$-th set to select from is not known until the
first $n$ selections have been made: here the admissible values of $x_{n+1}$ are
exactly the $R$-successors of $x_n$, so the family being chosen from is built
along the choosing. Thus the displayed recursion is directly an instance of
DC; it is not itself an application of the fixed-family formulation of
countable choice. This observation concerns the input to the two axioms and
makes no claim about a nonimplication between them.

**The starting point may be dropped.** The formally weaker statement obtained by
deleting the clause $x_0 = a$ — for every nonempty $X$ and every entire $R$ there
is a sequence with $x_n \mathbin{R} x_{n+1}$ for all $n$ — is an immediate
consequence of the form above, since $X$ is nonempty and any of its elements may
be taken as $a$. The reverse derivation is standard and is not needed anywhere in
this library, so it is not carried out; every use below prescribes $x_0$.

**$R$ need not be an order and the terms need not be distinct.** What DC delivers
is a sequence, that is a function $\mathbb{N} \to X$, not a chain in the
order-theoretic sense ([[def-chain]]). The relation may be symmetric, and the
sequence may repeat a value or be constant; all that is asserted is
$x_n \mathbin{R} x_{n+1}$ at every index.

## Remarks

**Locally proved implications between the choice principles.** The later
[[thm-choice-implies-dependent-implies-countable-choice]] proves in ZF that

$$\mathrm{AC}\Longrightarrow\mathrm{DC}\Longrightarrow\mathrm{AC}_\omega.$$

Its first implication uses AC to select a successor for each state and then
recurses on that specified function. Its second applies DC to the set of finite
partial selections, starting from the empty function, and takes their union.
This item makes no assertion about reversing either implication.

**Nothing in this library proves DC, and nothing assumes it silently.** Like
[[def-axiom-of-choice]] and [[def-countable-choice]], DC is a statement that may
be assumed or not. Every theorem whose proof uses it says so in its own
statement, and the accounting for the compactness page is collected in
[[rem-compactness-choice-ledger-metric]].

**The cost of a particular argument.** When an item records a DC use,
it asserts that the written argument is carried out in $\mathrm{ZF}+\mathrm{DC}$.
Necessity or equivalence needs a separate proof and does not follow from the
chosen argument alone.
