## Definition

Let $U\subseteq\mathbb R^m$ be open and let $f:U\to\mathbb R$ have second partial derivatives. Its **Hessian** at $a\in U$ is the matrix $H_f(a)=(\partial_i\partial_j f(a))_{i,j<m}$ in the matrix space of [[def-matrix-space]], using the multi-index notation of [[def-ck-and-multi-index-notation-in-several-variables]]. A point $a$ is **critical** when its gradient $\nabla f(a)$ is zero, with the gradient convention of [[def-jacobian-matrix-and-gradient]].
