## Statement

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $F$ be a function with domain $n$ all of whose
values are nonempty sets. Then the family of its values,
$\mathcal{F} = F[n] = \{\, F(i) : i \in n \,\}$, has a choice function
([[def-choice-function]]).

This is a theorem of ZF: its proof uses no form of the Axiom of Choice
([[def-axiom-of-choice]]).

What is proved below is exactly the displayed statement, by induction on $n$. The
natural number $n$ serves as the index set in the von Neumann sense,
$n = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]), so "$F$ has domain $n$"
says precisely that the members of $\mathcal{F}$ are listed as
$F(0), \dots, F(n-1)$. The listing need not be injective, and $\mathcal{F}$ is the
set of values, so repetitions are harmless and are not counted.

The displayed statement and its proof use only a natural-number-indexed
function. They do not identify an arbitrary finite family with a particular
enumeration.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural number $n$, used as the index set $n = \{0, \dots, n-1\}$, and a function $F$ with domain $n$ such that $F(i) \ne \emptyset$ for every $i \in n$; write $F[n] = \{F(i) : i \in n\}$ for the family of values of $F$.

[A1] $P(n)$ denotes the statement: for every function $F$ with domain $n$ all of whose values are nonempty sets, the family $F[n]$ has a choice function.

[L1] Induction principle: if $P(0)$ holds and $P(n)$ implies $P(n+1)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $P(n)$ holds for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, where $n + 1$ denotes the successor $\sigma(n)$ ([[thm-induction-principle]], [[def-nat-addition]]).

[L2] A choice function for a family $\mathcal{F}$ is a function $g$ with domain $\mathcal{F}$ such that $g(S) \in S$ for every $S \in \mathcal{F}$ ([[def-choice-function]]).

[L3] $0=\emptyset$ and $\sigma(n)=n\cup\{n\}$, so $n\subseteq\sigma(n)$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]). Thus a function $F$ with domain $\sigma(n)$ restricts to a function with domain $n$; moreover, directly from the definition of image, $y\in F[\sigma(n)]$ iff $y=F(i)$ for some $i\in n$ or $y=F(n)$, so $F[\sigma(n)]=F[n]\cup\{F(n)\}$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case: $0 = \emptyset$, so the only function with domain $0$ is the empty function, its family of values is $F[0] = \emptyset$, and the empty function has domain $\emptyset$ and satisfies the defining condition vacuously, so it is a choice function for $F[0]$; hence $P(0)$ holds. [base, A1, L2, L3]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume $P(n)$, that every function with domain $n$ whose values are all nonempty has a choice function for its family of values. [ih, A1]

1.3 Let $F$ be an arbitrary function with domain $\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$ all of whose values are nonempty sets; write $S = F(n)$ and $\mathcal{G} = F[n]$, the family of values of the restriction $F \restriction n$, so that $F[\sigma(n)] = \mathcal{G} \cup \{S\}$. [given, L3]

2.1 The restriction $F \restriction n$ is a function with domain $n$, and every value of it is a value of $F$, hence nonempty; so the inductive hypothesis applies to it and supplies a choice function $h$ for $\mathcal{G}$, a function with domain $\mathcal{G}$ satisfying $h(T) \in T$ for every $T \in \mathcal{G}$. [step 1.3, step 1.2, L2, L3]

2.2 The set $S = F(n)$ is one of the values of $F$, hence nonempty, so there exists an element of $S$; fix one and call it $a$. [step 1.3, choose]

3.1 Define $g = (h \restriction (\mathcal{G} \setminus \{S\})) \cup \{(S, a)\}$; its two pieces are functions with the disjoint domains $\mathcal{G} \setminus \{S\}$ and $\{S\}$, so $g$ is a function, and its domain is $(\mathcal{G} \setminus \{S\}) \cup \{S\} = \mathcal{G} \cup \{S\} = F[\sigma(n)]$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 1.3, construct]

4.1 Every $T \in F[\sigma(n)]$ is either $S$ or a member of $\mathcal{G} \setminus \{S\}$; in the first case $g(S) = a \in S$, and in the second $g(T) = h(T) \in T$ because $h$ is a choice function for $\mathcal{G}$. So $g(T) \in T$ throughout. [step 3.1, step 2.1, step 2.2]

5.1 Hence $g$ is a choice function for $F[\sigma(n)]$, and since $F$ was an arbitrary function with domain $\sigma(n)$ with nonempty values, $P(n)$ implies $P(n+1)$. [step 4.1, step 3.1, step 1.3, L2, A1]

6.1 By the induction principle, $P(n)$ holds for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$: the family of values of any function whose domain is a natural number and whose values are nonempty has a choice function. [step 1.1, step 5.1, L1, discharge-induction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Later finiteness terminology.** A finite set is defined later as one
  equinumerous with a natural number ([[def-countable]]). That terminology is
  not used in the proof above, which keeps its exact indexed-family scope.
- **Where the Axiom of Choice would be needed, and why it is not needed here.** Step 2.2 picks one element out of one nonempty set. That is a single existential instantiation, licensed by first-order logic alone. The induction performs one such instantiation per stage, and the stages are indexed by a natural number, so the process terminates. ZF cannot in general turn an arbitrary infinite family of nonempty sets into a simultaneous choice function; that is the gap [[def-axiom-of-choice]] fills. An infinite family with a distinguished element in each member may still have an explicit choice function in ZF, as [[ex-russells-socks]] shows.
- **Why the family is presented as an indexed one.** Stated over "a family of exactly $n$ sets", the successor step would have to assert that deleting one member of a family of $n+1$ sets leaves exactly $n$, which is a claim about cardinality and needs a theory of finiteness this page does not have. Indexed by $n$, the same step is the restriction $F \restriction n$ of a function, which is immediate from $n \subseteq \sigma(n)$ and costs nothing. Nothing else in the argument changes.
- The listing may repeat, and the argument is arranged so that repetition needs no separate treatment: $g$ is built by overwriting rather than by adjoining, so it is a function whether or not $S$ already occurs among $F(0), \dots, F(n-1)$. In particular $\mathcal{F}$ may have strictly fewer than $n$ members.
- The lemma is not a special case of the Axiom of Choice that happens to be provable; it is the precise boundary of what is free. [[ex-russells-socks]] makes the boundary concrete, and [[ex-finite-choice-by-induction]] works this induction out on a small family.
