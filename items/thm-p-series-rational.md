## Statement

Let $p \in \mathbb{Q}$ with $p > 0$. For a natural number $k \ge 1$ write
$\iota(k) = k \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the canonical natural, which is positive
([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]), and write $k^{p} := \iota(k)^{p}$ for its rational
power ([[def-rational-power]]). Then

$$\sum_{k \ge 1} \frac{1}{k^{p}} \ \text{converges} \qquad \Longleftrightarrow \qquad p > 1 .$$

In particular the harmonic series $\sum_{k \ge 1} 1/k$ diverges, at $p = 1$, and
$\sum_{k \ge 1} 1/k^{2}$ converges, at $p = 2$.

**The index range is not cosmetic.** The series starts at $k = 1$ because
$1/0^{p}$ is undefined: [[def-rational-power]] gives $0^{p} = 0$ for rational
$p > 0$, and $0$ has no inverse. Sequences here are functions on $\mathbb{N}$ and
$\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$ ([[def-series]]), so the object named above is a series
from the starting index $1$ in the sense of [[def-series]], not a series of a
sequence on $\mathbb{N}$.

**The exponent is rational, and that is a limitation of this page.** Rational
powers of a positive base are what [[def-rational-power]] supplies; real exponents
require the exponential and the logarithm, which this library develops later. The
statement above is therefore the full $p$-series theorem for every exponent this
page can name.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A rational $p > 0$ and the family $a_k := 1/k^{p} = \iota(k)^{-p}$, defined for naturals $k \ge 1$ ([[def-rational-power]], [[def-series]]).

[L1] Rational powers of a positive base are positive, and $a^{r+s} = a^{r}a^{s}$, $(a^{r})^{s} = a^{rs}$, $a^{-r} = 1/a^{r}$ for $a > 0$ and rationals $r, s$ ([[lem-rational-power-laws]]).

[L2] Monotonicity of rational powers: for rational $t > 0$ and $0 < a < b$ one has $a^{t} < b^{t}$; and for $a > 1$ and rationals $r < s$ one has $a^{r} < a^{s}$ ([[lem-rational-power-monotone]]).

[L3] The integer power and the rational power agree at an integer exponent: for $a > 0$ and $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, $a^{n}$ read as in [[def-integer-power]] equals $a^{n}$ read as in [[def-rational-power]], since $n = n/1$ and $a^{1/1} = a$ ([[thm-nth-roots-exist]], [[def-rational-power]]). In particular $a^{0} = 1$.

[L4] Reciprocation reverses the order on the positives: $0 < a < b$ implies $0 < 1/b < 1/a$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

[L5] Condensation: for a family $(x_k)_{k \ge 1}$ that is nonnegative and nonincreasing, $\sum_{k \ge 1} x_k$ converges if and only if $\sum_{j \ge 0} 2^{j} x_{2^{j}}$ converges ([[thm-cauchy-condensation]], [[def-monotone-sequence]]).

[L6] The geometric series: $\sum_{j \ge 0} r^{j}$ converges if and only if $|r| < 1$ ([[thm-geometric-series]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L7] The canonical naturals are positive and order preserving: $0 < \iota(1) \le \iota(j) < \iota(k)$ for naturals $1 \le j < k$, and $\iota(2) = 2 > 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For every natural $k \ge 1$ the base $\iota(k)$ is positive, so $a_k = \iota(k)^{-p}$ is defined and positive; in particular the family is nonnegative. [given, L7, L1]

1.2 For naturals $1 \le j < k$ we have $0 < \iota(j) < \iota(k)$, hence $\iota(j)^{p} < \iota(k)^{p}$ since $p > 0$, hence $a_j = 1/\iota(j)^{p} > 1/\iota(k)^{p} = a_k$; and for $j = k$ the two are equal. So $a_j \ge a_k$ whenever $1 \le j \le k$. [given, L7, L2, L4, L1]

1.3 For every $j \in \mathbb{N}$ the base $2^{j}$ is positive and, reading the exponent $j$ as a rational, $2^{j} a_{2^{j}} = 2^{j} \big(2^{j}\big)^{-p} = 2^{j} \cdot 2^{-jp} = 2^{\,j - jp} = 2^{\,(1-p)j} = \big(2^{\,1-p}\big)^{j}$. [L1, L3, L7, algebra]

1.4 Since $2 > 1$, the map $t \mapsto 2^{t}$ is strictly increasing on $\mathbb{Q}$ and $2^{0} = 1$; hence $r = 2^{\,1-p} < 1 = 2^{0}$ holds exactly when $1 - p < 0$, that is exactly when $p > 1$. [L2, L3, L7]

2.1 Condensation applies to $(a_k)_{k \ge 1}$: $\sum_{k \ge 1} a_k$ converges if and only if $\sum_{j \ge 0} 2^{j} a_{2^{j}}$ converges. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L5]

2.2 So the condensed series is the geometric series $\sum_{j \ge 0} r^{j}$ with $r := 2^{\,1-p}$, and $r > 0$, so $|r| = r$. [step 1.3, L1, L3]

3.1 By the geometric series theorem, $\sum_{j \ge 0} r^{j}$ converges if and only if $r < 1$. [step 2.2, L6]

4.1 Chaining the three equivalences: $\sum_{k \ge 1} 1/k^{p}$ converges $\iff$ the condensed series converges $\iff$ $r < 1$ $\iff$ $p > 1$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, step 1.4] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the threshold comes from.** Condensation turns the $p$-series into a geometric series of ratio $2^{1-p}$, and the geometric threshold $r = 1$ pulls back to $p = 1$. Nothing about the number $1$ is special to the $p$-series; it is the exponent at which the condensed terms stop shrinking.

- **At $p = 1$ the condensed series is $\sum_{j \ge 0} 1$.** Its terms do not tend to $0$, so it diverges, and with it the harmonic series. That instance is worked out on the companion page, together with the older block argument that does not use condensation at all.

- **Only rational exponents are covered, and the gap is real.** For irrational $p$ the expression $k^{p}$ has no meaning in this library yet, so the statement is not merely unproved there, it is unstatable. The same limitation is what keeps the Bertrand-type series $\sum 1/(k (\log k)^{p})$ off this page entirely, the logarithm not being available.
