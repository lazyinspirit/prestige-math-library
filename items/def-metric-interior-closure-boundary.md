## Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]), let $A \subseteq X$ and let
$x \in X$. Balls are as in [[def-metric-ball]] and open sets as in
[[def-metric-topology]]; recall that a real $r$ written as a radius is always
$> 0$.

- $x$ is an **interior point** of $A$ if $B(x,r) \subseteq A$ for some $r$. The
  set of interior points is the **interior** $\operatorname{int}(A)$.
- $x$ is an **adherent point** of $A$ if $B(x,r) \cap A \ne \emptyset$ for every
  $r$. The set of adherent points is the **closure** $\overline{A}$.
- $x$ is a **limit point** (accumulation point) of $A$ if
  $B(x,r) \cap (A \setminus \{x\}) \ne \emptyset$ for every $r$. The set of limit
  points is the **derived set** $A'$.
- $x$ is an **isolated point** of $A$ if $x \in A$ and $B(x,r) \cap A = \{x\}$
  for some $r$.
- The **boundary** of $A$ is $\partial A := \overline{A} \setminus \operatorname{int}(A)$.
- $A$ is **dense** in $X$ if $\overline{A} = X$.

**The interior is open, and it is the largest open subset of $A$.** If
$x \in \operatorname{int}(A)$, fix $r$ with $B(x,r) \subseteq A$; the ball
$B(x,r)$ is itself open ([[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]]), so every
$y \in B(x,r)$ has some $s$ with $B(y,s) \subseteq B(x,r) \subseteq A$, which
puts $y$ in $\operatorname{int}(A)$. Hence $B(x,r) \subseteq \operatorname{int}(A)$
and $\operatorname{int}(A)$ is open. It is contained in $A$, since
$x \in B(x,r) \subseteq A$ for an interior point $x$; and if $V \subseteq A$ is
open then every $v \in V$ has a ball inside $V \subseteq A$, so
$V \subseteq \operatorname{int}(A)$.

**Two descriptions of the boundary agree.** $x \in \partial A$ says that every
ball around $x$ meets $A$ and that no ball around $x$ is contained in $A$; the
second half says exactly that every ball around $x$ meets $X \setminus A$. So

$$\partial A = \{\, x \in X : B(x,r) \cap A \ne \emptyset \text{ and } B(x,r) \cap (X \setminus A) \ne \emptyset \text{ for every } r \,\},$$

from which $\partial A = \partial(X \setminus A)$ is immediate.

**Elementary containments, straight from the definitions.** $A \subseteq \overline{A}$,
because $x \in A$ lies in every $B(x,r) \cap A$; $A' \subseteq \overline{A}$,
because a ball meeting $A \setminus \{x\}$ meets $A$; and
$\operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq A \subseteq \overline{A}$. A point of $A$ is
either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$, and not both, according to
whether some ball meets $A$ only in $x$.

## Remarks

- **The closure is defined here by adherent points and by nothing else.** That it
  is closed, that it is the smallest closed set containing $A$, that for nonempty
  $A$ it is $\{x : d(x,A) = 0\}$, and that it consists of the limits of sequences
  from $A$, are theorems ([[thm-metric-closure-characterisation]],
  [[thm-metric-sequential-closure]]) and are proved from this definition.
- **Limit point of a set is not the same notion as subsequential limit of a
  sequence** ([[def-subsequential-limit]]), which this library deliberately keeps
  under a different name: the constant sequence $x_k = 0$ has $0$ as a
  subsequential limit, while its set of values $\{0\}$ has no limit point at all.
- **Dense is relative to the ambient space**, and the ambient space is part of
  the data: $A$ is dense in $X$ when $\overline{A} = X$, with $\overline{A}$
  computed in $(X,d)$. The same $A$ inside a larger space is a different
  question.
