## Statement

Let $\mathbb{R}$ be a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).
For every $a \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a \ge 0$ and every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with
$n \ge 1$ there is a **unique** $s \in \mathbb{R}$ with $s \ge 0$ and $s^n = a$
([[def-integer-power]]); we write

$$s = a^{1/n} = \sqrt[n]{a}.$$

Moreover $a^{1/n} > 0$ when $a > 0$, and $a^{1/1} = a$.

**This generalises the published [[thm-of-square-roots]], and the case $n = 2$ is
not new.** That theorem already produces the unique $\sqrt{a} \ge 0$ with
$(\sqrt{a})^2 = a$, and it is cited as such throughout the library; the notation
$a^{1/2}$ introduced here is the same number. What is new is the passage to
general $n$: the completed square that drives the $n = 2$ argument has no direct
analogue, and its place is taken by the factorisation of $b^n - a^n$ and the
resulting Lipschitz estimate ([[lem-power-difference-factorisation]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), that is, an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with the least-upper-bound property; an element $a \ge 0$; and a natural $n \ge 1$, with $\iota(n) \in \mathbb{R}$ written $n$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[lem-of-q-embeds]]).

[L1] Least-upper-bound property: every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above ([[def-bounded-set]]) has a least upper bound, and it is unique, so the notation $\sup S$ is legitimate ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L2] Epsilon characterisation of the supremum: if $S$ is nonempty and bounded above and $u = \sup S$, then for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $t \in S$ with $u - \varepsilon < t$ ([[lem-sup-epsilon]]).

[L3] Monotonicity of powers ([[lem-power-monotone]]): $x \mapsto x^n$ is strictly increasing on $\{x \ge 0\}$ for $n \ge 1$, hence injective there; $x \ge 0$ implies $x^n \ge 0$ and $x > 0$ implies $x^n > 0$; and $x \ge 1$ implies $x^n \ge x$.

[L4] Lipschitz estimate ([[lem-power-difference-factorisation]]): if $0 \le x \le y \le B$ and $n \ge 1$ then $0 \le y^n - x^n \le n B^{\,n-1}(y - x)$.

[L5] Order arithmetic: adding a constant preserves the order and for $c > 0$, $x < y \iff cx < cy$ ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]]), both stated there for the STRICT order alone, so where a $\le$ is added or scaled below the move is that statement together with the case of equality, settled by trichotomy ([[def-ordered-field]]); $1 > 0$, which is proved in [[cor-of-one-positive]] and stated by none of those three, hence $2 = 1 + 1 > 0$; and $0 < 2^{-1} < 1$, since $0 < 1 < 2$ gives $0 < 2^{-1} < 1^{-1} = 1$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]], claim 2).

[L6] Trichotomy: for $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$ exactly one of $x < y$, $x = y$, $y < x$ holds; consequently any two elements have a minimum ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L7] A product with a zero factor vanishes: $0 \cdot x = x \cdot 0 = 0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 If $a = 0$ then $s = 0$ satisfies $s \ge 0$ and $s^n = 0 = a$, since $0^n = 0^{n-1} \cdot 0 = 0$ for $n \ge 1$; so existence holds in that case and we assume $a > 0$ from here on. [given, L3, L7, algebra]

1.2 Uniqueness holds as soon as a root exists: if $u, v \ge 0$ satisfy $u^n = v^n$, then strict monotonicity of $x \mapsto x^n$ on the nonnegatives rules out both $u < v$ and $v < u$, so $u = v$ by trichotomy. [L3, L6]

1.3 Define $S = \{t \in \mathbb{R} : t \ge 0 \text{ and } t^n \le a\}$; then $0 \in S$, because $0 \ge 0$ and $0^n = 0 \le a$, so $S$ is nonempty. [given, L3, L7]

1.4 The element $M := 1 + a$ is an upper bound of $S$: since $a > 0$ and $1 > 0$ we have $M > 1$ and $M > a$, so any $t > M$ satisfies $t > 1$, whence $t^n \ge t > M > a$ and $t \notin S$. [given, L3, L5]

2.1 By the least-upper-bound property $s := \sup S$ exists in $\mathbb{R}$; moreover $s \ge 0$ because $0 \in S$, and $s \le M$ because $M$ is an upper bound and $s$ is the least one. [L1, step 1.3, step 1.4]

3.1 Put $B := M + 1 = a + 2$; then $B > M \ge 1 > 0$, so $B^{\,n-1} > 0$ and $n B^{\,n-1} > 0$, and every $x$ with $0 \le x \le M + 1$ satisfies $0 \le x \le B$. [step 2.1, L3, L5]

3.2 Assume, for contradiction, that $s^n \ne a$; by trichotomy either $s^n < a$ or $s^n > a$. [assume-contra, step 2.1, L6]

4.1 (Case $s^n < a$.) Put $\delta := \min\{1, (a - s^n)(n B^{\,n-1})^{-1}\}$, which is $> 0$ since $a - s^n > 0$ and $n B^{\,n-1} > 0$, and put $h := 2^{-1}\delta$, so that $0 < h < \delta \le 1$ and $h < (a - s^n)(nB^{\,n-1})^{-1}$; then $0 \le s \le s + h \le M + 1 = B$, so the Lipschitz estimate gives $(s+h)^n - s^n \le nB^{\,n-1} h < a - s^n$, hence $(s+h)^n < a$ and $s + h \in S$, while $s + h > s$ contradicts that $s$ is an upper bound of $S$. [assume-case low, step 3.2, step 2.1, step 3.1, L4, L5, L6, choose]

4.2 (Case $s^n > a$.) Here $s > 0$, since $s = 0$ would give $s^n = 0 \le a$; put $\delta := \min\{s, (s^n - a)(nB^{\,n-1})^{-1}\} > 0$ and $h := 2^{-1}\delta$, so that $0 < h < s$ and $h < (s^n - a)(nB^{\,n-1})^{-1}$; then $0 \le s - h \le s \le B$, so the Lipschitz estimate gives $s^n - (s-h)^n \le nB^{\,n-1}h < s^n - a$, hence $(s-h)^n > a$; applying the epsilon characterisation with $\varepsilon = h$ produces $t \in S$ with $t > s - h \ge 0$, whence $t^n > (s-h)^n > a$ by strict monotonicity, contradicting $t \in S$. [assume-case high, step 3.2, step 2.1, step 3.1, L2, L3, L4, L5, L6, L7, choose]

5.1 Both cases of the disjunction in step 3.2 are impossible, so the assumption fails and $s^n = a$; this $s$ is the unique nonnegative $n$-th root of $a$ by step 1.2, it satisfies $s > 0$ when $a > 0$ because $s = 0$ would force $a = s^n = 0$, and at $n = 1$ the element $a$ itself is a nonnegative solution of $s^1 = a$, so $a^{1/1} = a$; writing $a^{1/n} = \sqrt[n]{a}$ for it, the case $n = 2$ recovers the already published $\sqrt{a}$ of [[thm-of-square-roots]]. [step 4.1, step 4.2, step 3.2, step 1.2, step 1.1, L3, L7, cases, discharge-contradiction] ∎
