## Statement

**False claim:** if $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is Riemann integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]) with $f(x) \ge 0$ for every $x \in [a,b]$ and
$\int_a^b f = 0$, then $f(x) = 0$ for every $x \in [a,b]$.

The claim is true under the additional hypothesis that $f$ is continuous, and
that is the version worth remembering; without it the integral simply cannot see
a function that is positive on a null set. Thomae's function on $[0,1]$
([[def-dirichlet-and-thomae-functions]]) is nonnegative, integrable, has
integral $0$, and is positive at **every** rational point of $[0,1]$, of which
there are infinitely many.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Thomae's function restricted to $[0,1]$, that is $t : [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ with $t(x) = 1/\iota(q(x))$ at a rational $x$ with least denominator $q(x) \ge 1$, and $t(x) = 0$ at an irrational $x$ ([[def-dirichlet-and-thomae-functions]], [[def-canonical-natural]]).

[A1] The false claim: a nonnegative Riemann integrable function on a closed bounded interval with distinct endpoints whose integral is $0$ vanishes identically.

[L1] $t(x) = 1/\iota(q(x))$ with $\iota(q(x)) \ge 1 > 0$ at a rational $x$, and $t(x) = 0$ at an irrational $x$; hence $0 \le t(x) \le 1$ everywhere and $t(x) > 0$ at every rational $x$ ([[def-dirichlet-and-thomae-functions]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L2] Thomae's function on $\mathbb{R}$ is continuous at every irrational and discontinuous at every rational ([[thm-dirichlet-and-thomae-continuity-sets]]); a restriction of a function continuous at a point of the smaller domain is continuous there, the same $\delta$ serving a condition quantified over fewer points ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L3] $\mathbb{Q}$ is countably infinite, and every subset of an at most countable set is at most countable ([[thm-rationals-countable]], [[lem-subset-of-countable]], [[def-countable]]).

[L4] A bounded function on $[a,b]$ with an at most countable set of discontinuities is Riemann integrable ([[cor-countably-many-discontinuities-integrable]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L5] The irrationals are dense in $\mathbb{R}$, so every nonempty open interval contains an irrational ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L6] For a partition $P = (n,t^{P})$ of $[0,1]$: $n \ge 1$, $t^{P}_i < t^{P}_{i+1}$, $\Delta_i > 0$, and $I_i = [t^{P}_i, t^{P}_{i+1}] \subseteq [0,1]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-interval]]).

[L7] $L(t,P) = \sum_{i<n}m_i\Delta_i$ with $m_i = \inf t[I_i]$; $\underline{\int_0^1} t$ is the supremum of the lower sums, $\overline{\int_0^1} t$ the infimum of the upper sums, and the integral is their common value when they agree ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L8] A set with a least element has it as its infimum; the supremum of $\{0\}$ is $0$ ([[def-infimum]], [[def-max-min]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L9] Finite sums: $\sum_{i<n}0 = 0$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L10] Ordered-field arithmetic: the order is total and transitive; a reciprocal of a positive quantity is positive; $0 < 1$ ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $t$ is nonnegative and bounded on $[0,1]$, with $0 \le t(x) \le 1$ for every $x$, by [L1]. [given, L1, L10]

1.2 $t$ is continuous at every irrational point of $[0,1]$ by [L2], so its set of discontinuities in $[0,1]$ is contained in $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$, which is at most countable by [L3]; every subset of it is then at most countable by [L3] as well. [given, L2, L3]

1.3 Separately, and independently of everything below, $t$ does not vanish identically: $2^{-1}$ is a rational point of $[0,1]$, so $t(2^{-1}) > 0$ by [L1] and [L10]. [L1, L10]

2.1 By [L4] applied to $[0,1]$, with $0 < 1$, the function $t$ is Riemann integrable on $[0,1]$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L4]

2.2 Every lower Darboux sum of $t$ is $0$: let $P$ be a partition of $[0,1]$ and $i < n$; the open interval $(t^{P}_i, t^{P}_{i+1})$ is nonempty by [L6] and contains an irrational $y$ by [L5], and $y \in I_i \subseteq [0,1]$, so $t(y) = 0$ by [L1]. Since $t \ge 0$ by [L1], the value $0$ is the least element of $t[I_i]$ and $m_i = 0$ by [L8]. Hence $L(t,P) = \sum_{i<n}0\cdot\Delta_i = 0$ by [L7] and [L9]. [step 1.1, L1, L5, L6, L7, L8, L9]

3.1 The set of lower sums is therefore $\{0\}$, so $\underline{\int_0^1} t = 0$ by [L8], and since $t$ is integrable by step 2.1 its integral is $\int_0^1 t = 0$ by [L7]. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L7, L8]

4.1 So $t$ is a nonnegative Riemann integrable function on $[0,1]$ with $\int_0^1 t = 0$ that is not identically zero; [A1] fails at $t$ and the claim is false. [step 1.1, step 3.1, step 1.3, A1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The correct statement, and the hypothesis that repairs it.** If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, nonnegative and $\int_a^b f = 0$, then $f \equiv 0$: a point with $f(c) > 0$ would, by continuity, force $f > f(c)\cdot 2^{-1}$ on a whole subinterval, and $\int_a^b f$ would then be at least $f(c)\cdot 2^{-1}$ times the length of that subinterval, by [[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]] applied there. That argument is not carried out here, because the additivity of the integral over subintervals is not available at this point in the reading order; what is asserted by this item is only that the hypothesis of continuity cannot simply be dropped.

- **The exceptional set is exactly the rationals.** $t$ is positive precisely on $\mathbb{Q}\cap[0,1]$, a countable dense set, which is null ([[lem-countable-sets-are-null]]). The integral is blind to a null set of positive values, and the Lebesgue criterion explains why: what governs integrability, and here the value, is the size of the set where the function misbehaves, measured by interval covers ([[thm-lebesgue-criterion]]).

- **Every upper sum, by contrast, is positive.** Each subinterval contains a rational, so $M_i > 0$ for every $i$ and $U(t,P) > 0$ for every partition $P$; the upper integral is nevertheless $0$, since the infimum of a set of positive numbers may be $0$. That is the one place where this example is worth pausing over, and it is the reason the lower sums, not the upper ones, are what step 2.2 computes.
