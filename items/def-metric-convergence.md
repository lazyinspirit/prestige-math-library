## Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]).

A **sequence in $X$** is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to X$, written $(x_k)$ with
$x_k := x(k)$. As everywhere in this library, $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
([[def-natural-numbers]]) and a sequence is indexed from $0$
([[def-sequence]]); an index range copied from a text that starts at $1$ must be
shifted before it is used here.

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence in $X$ and $p \in X$. The function
$k \mapsto d(x_k, p)$ is a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]), and it is
nonnegative ([[lem-metric-nonnegativity]]), so $|d(x_k,p)| = d(x_k,p)$
([[def-abs-value]]). Define

$$x_k \longrightarrow p \text{ in } (X,d) \quad :\Longleftrightarrow \quad d(x_k,p) \longrightarrow 0 \text{ in } \mathbb{R},$$

the convergence on the right being that of [[def-real-limit]]. Unwound, this
says: for every **rational** $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with
$d(x_k, p) < \varepsilon$ for every $k \ge K$. We then call $p$ a **limit** of
$(x_k)$, and say $(x_k)$ **converges** in $(X,d)$ if it has a limit.

**Rational and real $\varepsilon$ agree here, as they do on the real line.**
[[def-real-limit]] tests convergence against rational $\varepsilon$ only, and its
own remark, restated for sequences in [[def-sequence]], records that nothing is
lost: below any real $\eta > 0$ lies a positive rational
([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and the index belonging to that rational serves for
$\eta$. So a proof may establish convergence by producing an index for every
real $\varepsilon > 0$, and may use a convergence hypothesis at a real
$\varepsilon$ by first passing to a rational below it. Both moves are used on
this page and are always cited.

**Subsequences and subsequential limits.** A **subsequence** of $(x_k)$ is the
composite $x \circ n$ for a strictly increasing $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$,
written $(x_{n_j})$, exactly as for sequences of reals ([[def-sequence]]); and
$p$ is a **subsequential limit** of $(x_k)$ in $(X,d)$ when some subsequence
converges to $p$, which is the metric-space form of [[def-subsequential-limit]].

## Remarks

- **A limit is a point of $X$, and uniqueness is a theorem.** Nothing in the
  definition rules out two limits; that a sequence in a metric space has at most
  one is [[lem-metric-limits-unique]], and its proof is where the separation
  axiom (M1) is spent. Reading the same definition with a pseudometric
  ([[def-metric-space]]) that is not a metric, that is one with $p(a,b) = 0$ for
  some $a \ne b$, limits are genuinely not unique: the constant sequence at $a$
  converges to $b$ as well.
- **Convergence is defined from the metric but determined by the topology.**
  It can be restated as "every open set containing $p$ contains $x_k$ for all
  large $k$", which follows from [[lem-metric-ball-neighbourhood-base]]; so it is
  unchanged by passing to a topologically equivalent metric
  ([[def-equivalent-metrics]]). That restatement is not made part of the
  definition, because the metric form is what every proof on this page uses.
- **The relation between convergence and closure** is
  [[thm-metric-sequential-closure]]: a point lies in the closure of $A$ exactly
  when some sequence in $A$ converges to it.
