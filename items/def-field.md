## Definition

A **field** is a set $F$ equipped with two binary operations $+$ (addition) and
$\cdot$ (multiplication) and two distinguished elements $0 \ne 1$ of $F$,
satisfying:

- **(A)** $(F, +)$ is an abelian group with identity $0$: addition is
  associative and commutative, $x + 0 = x$ for all $x$, and every $x$ has an
  additive inverse $-x$ with $x + (-x) = 0$.
- **(M)** Multiplication is associative and commutative **on all of $F$**, and
  $x \cdot 1 = x$ for every $x \in F$; moreover $(F \setminus \{0\}, \cdot)$ is an
  abelian group with identity $1$, so every $x \ne 0$ has a multiplicative inverse
  $x^{-1}$ with $x \cdot x^{-1} = 1$.
- **(D)** Multiplication distributes over addition: $x \cdot (y + z) = x\cdot y + x\cdot z$.

We write $x - y := x + (-y)$ and $x/y := x \cdot y^{-1}$ (for $y \ne 0$), and
abbreviate $x \cdot y$ as $xy$.

## Remarks

- The rationals $\mathbb{Q}$ ([[thm-rat-field]]) and both constructions of the
  reals ([[thm-reals-field]], [[thm-reals-dedekind-field]]) are fields. This
  definition states the field axioms once, abstractly, so that every field fact
  proved from them applies to all of these at once.
- The requirement $0 \ne 1$ excludes the trivial one-element structure.
- **Why (M) quantifies over all of $F$ explicitly** (amended 2026-07-28, owner
  approved). An earlier wording headed (M) with the group
  $(F \setminus \{0\}, \cdot)$ alone, and under that strict reading the axioms
  do not pin down the products $0 \cdot y$: take $\mathbb{F}_2$ and redefine
  $0 \cdot y := y$, which leaves (A) untouched, leaves
  $(F \setminus \{0\}, \cdot)$ the trivial group, and satisfies (D) in all eight
  instances, yet has $0 \cdot 1 = 1$ — making [[lem-of-zero-mult]] false in a
  purported model of the axioms. Associativity, commutativity and
  $x \cdot 1 = x$ are therefore asserted on **all** of $F$, the element $0$
  included. Commutativity on all of $F$ is also what turns (D) into its
  right-hand form $(y + z) \cdot x = y \cdot x + z \cdot x$, which
  [[lem-of-zero-mult]] uses.
- The identities $0, 1$ and the inverses $-x, x^{-1}$ are unique
  ([[lem-of-inverse-unique]]), so writing them as single-valued notation, and
  the abbreviations $x - y := x + (-y)$ and $x/y := x y^{-1}$, are legitimate.
