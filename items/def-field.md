## Definition

A **field** is a set $F$ equipped with two binary operations $+$ (addition) and
$\cdot$ (multiplication) and two distinguished elements $0 \ne 1$ of $F$,
satisfying:

- **(A)** $(F, +)$ is an abelian group with identity $0$: addition is
  associative and commutative, $x + 0 = x$ for all $x$, and every $x$ has an
  additive inverse $-x$ with $x + (-x) = 0$.
- **(M)** $(F \setminus \{0\}, \cdot)$ is an abelian group with identity $1$:
  multiplication is associative and commutative, $x \cdot 1 = x$ for all $x$, and
  every $x \ne 0$ has a multiplicative inverse $x^{-1}$ with $x \cdot x^{-1} = 1$.
- **(D)** Multiplication distributes over addition: $x \cdot (y + z) = x\cdot y + x\cdot z$.

We write $x - y := x + (-y)$ and $x/y := x \cdot y^{-1}$ (for $y \ne 0$), and
abbreviate $x \cdot y$ as $xy$.

## Remarks

- The rationals $\mathbb{Q}$ ([[thm-rat-field]]) and both constructions of the
  reals ([[thm-reals-field]], [[thm-reals-dedekind-field]]) are fields. This
  definition states the field axioms once, abstractly, so that every field fact
  proved from them applies to all of these at once.
- The requirement $0 \ne 1$ excludes the trivial one-element structure.
