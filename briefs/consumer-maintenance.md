# Separate consumer maintenance

**Proof formatting when editing items:** Separate numbered steps and the first
step after introductory prose with blank lines. Keep each complete step in one
paragraph, with single newlines inside it. End every step with valid `[tags]`;
put punctuation before the tags and use `[tags] ∎` on the final step. Preserve
mathematics and references. After final edits and any formatter, run once
before handoff: `node tools/proof-layout.mjs items/<id>.md ...`, batching all
your changed item paths in one command.
Read-only assignments report defects without editing.

**Proof repair quality for item editors.** When editing an item file, make every proof repair mathematically sound and as concise as the argument allows. State essential hypotheses and important caveats clearly; remove repeated talking points, filler, and padding that add no mathematical content. Add intermediate lemmas to satisfy unmet prerequisite if possible.

Read CLAUDE.md, README.md, the generated task and its frozen assignment fully.
The generated task is authoritative for exact identities, supplier events,
assigned existing items, output path and report schema. You are one of three
disjoint maintenance lanes. Empty lanes return honest empty decisions.

Edit only assigned items outside the immutable frontier. Published frontier
items belong to ordinary Step 5 and are not your maintenance targets. No new
items, unrelated edits, cosmetic improvements or weaker replacement claims.
This assignment is separate from Step-5 repair, judgment, adjudication and gates.
Do not launch workers, write judgments or certificates, or claim independent
review of your own repair.

Examine the exact mathematical use of every changed supplier listed in the
assignment. A candidate is not automatically defective. Leave a sound consumer
byte-for-byte unchanged. Repair only an actual invalidated claim or use, with
the smallest logically sufficient edit. Understand the statements, proof and
prerequisites; logical validity is the ground truth. Sources and earlier reviews
can be mistaken. When unsure, read authoritative arguments and check their
hypotheses. Record actual understanding, sources read and uncertainty honestly.
Unresolved uncertainty blocks completion; never invent evidence or confidence.

Keep item ownership disjoint. For necessary shared metadata work, acquire
`node tools/step5-shared-write-lock.mjs acquire --owner YOUR_DISPATCH_LABEL`,
reread the current file, make and check the minimum change, then promptly use
`release`. Exit 2 means busy: continue independent work and retry before edits.
Never hold the lock during research or waiting, or remove another owner's lock.
Record exact shared-file changes in run evidence and the task's integration
handoff. The maintenance collector currently verifies item carriers only; do
not claim it has verified shared metadata. Keep operational history out of the
canonical published-defect ledger.

Return `{run,pack,lane,input_sha256,decisions:[...]}` at the task's output path.
Copy identity and `input_sha256` exactly; the controller generates content
hashes. Each assigned item needs one decision with these fields:

- `id`, `disposition` (`sound` or `repaired`) and a specific `reason`.
- `understanding:{basis:"familiarity"|"sources",evidence,uncertainty:false,sources:[{url,read:true,evidence}]}`.
- `event_uses:[{event_key,affected_use,reason}]`, covering every exact supplier
  event assigned to that consumer.
- `affected_use`, `invalidated_claim`, `minimality` and
  `edits:[{before,after,necessity}]` for a repaired decision.

Every explanation must contain at least 40 characters of specific evidence.
Use `basis:"sources"` when source reading supports your understanding, with
nonempty actually read URLs and exact supporting evidence. Never claim
familiarity to evade required reading. For unresolved mathematics, report
`disposition:"escalated"` or `uncertainty:true`; collection must remain blocked.

Every declared edit needs its own precise necessary-repair explanation. Each
`before` snippet must occur uniquely at its sequential position in the frozen
input; `after` is its exact replacement. Account for every changed item byte.
Sound decisions use `edits:[]` and explain why every supplier event leaves the
consumer valid. Exact reconstruction checks accounting; it does not prove
mathematical necessity or minimality. You remain responsible for the argument.

The controller handles each supplier-interface event and outside consumer once;
gates or unrelated context changes do not reopen it. A necessary change to this
consumer's Statement/Definition creates another direct-consumer event. Proof-
only, citation, dependency and metadata edits do not propagate. Do not expand
a transitive closure or edit unassigned discoveries. The engine routes further
outside work to maintenance and returning frontier targets to ordinary owners.
Report unfinished work clearly. Central certification waits for required
frontier repair and maintenance closure after every writer drains.

**Algorithms.** Use `kind: algorithm`, an `alg-` ID and `## Definition`; algorithms function identically to definitions. Specify inputs, outputs, admissible conditions and exact instructions, including branches, calls and loops. A larger algorithm may compose or repeatedly invoke earlier smaller algorithms/procedures: put those supplier IDs in the larger algorithm's `deps`. Repetition in an execution does not create a self-edge or permit a prerequisite cycle. State correctness, termination, complexity and other properties in separate proved lemmas, theorems, propositions or corollaries; use `justified_by` for results establishing well-definedness under the ordinary definition rule. Procedure instructions are not a phase proof. Review the defining procedure and its actual prerequisites; changes to its Definition trigger the ordinary direct/indirect consumer checks.

**Diagram review and repair (Steps 2–5).** Adjudicate every TikZ/tikzcd diagram
in your assigned scope, including commutative diagrams, string diagrams, Young
tableaux, braids, Temperley–Lieb diagrams and other diagram types. Check
mathematical correctness against the text: objects, labels, arrow directions,
compositions, crossings, conventions and claimed identities. Repair incorrect
diagrams and add missing diagrams wherever the exposition requires them, within
your authorized write scope. Read-only roles report defects and needed additions;
escalate changes outside your scope. Keep diagrams compatible with conventions
in the literature, and keep rigorous proofs independent of the diagrams.
