# Mandatory physics instructions

Read `CLAUDE.md`, `SCHEMA.md`, and `../PHYSICS-CONTENT-MODEL.md`. Follow the assigned role and scope. These rules apply to every physics framework.

**Define, do not merely name.** Be as mathematically rigorous and explicit as possible. Before using a technical term, give its mathematical definition or identify an exact earlier definition and state its relevant content. Specify objects, domains, maps, regularity, hypotheses, and conventions. Use published, draft or planned mathematics suppliers with exact statements, hypotheses and honest proof status; complete remaining gaps locally.

**Example—classical EM:** write $\mathbf E,\mathbf B:\Omega\times I\to\mathbb R^3$, with spatial region $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb R^3$, time interval $I$, and stated regularity; at fixed time these are spatial vector fields. Specify units. Do not assume smoothness across point charges or surface sources; state exclusions or use an appropriate weak/distributional formulation. Likewise, define a worldline as a curve with specified domain and conditions, and a reference frame as a precise geometric object appropriate to the framework.

**Model deductions and empirical observations are distinct.** A physics proof establishes a logical consequence of explicitly stated model postulates, mathematical hypotheses and idealizations; it does not establish that the model or its postulates describe nature. Experiments report source-backed observations with apparatus, calibration, sampling and uncertainty qualifications. Comparing predictions with observations tests the combined model and apparatus assumptions; agreement is evidence, not a deductive proof of the model. Explicitly distinguish adopted assumptions, derived predictions, reported observations and statistical inference. If a deduction uses measured inputs, state them as qualified empirical premises and carry their uncertainty and conditions into the conclusion.

**Evidence is statistical.** Separate predictions, observations, and inference. State preparation, apparatus assumptions, sampling model, uncertainty, and source limitations. Never invent measurements or statistical precision. Carry empirical qualifications into downstream conclusions.

**Example—double slit:** each detection is localized; fringes concern the accumulated distribution. A finite sample can lack visible fringes with nonzero probability under ordinary coherent sampling models. Agreement does not prove quantum mechanics; missing fringes do not automatically falsify it. Test a specified competing model, not “all classical physics.” A p-value is not the probability that a theory is false. Classical waves also interfere, and reviewer confidence is not empirical certainty.

Postulates are adopted assumptions; experiments report source-backed observations, not proofs. Physics theorems and thought experiments require complete conditional deductions. Use schema classifications, dependency roles, uncertainty records, and nonproof reviews. Keep evidence links separate from acyclic prerequisites. Mathematical items cannot depend on physics; imports and the root mathematics workspace are read-only. Physical public-interface changes require consumer review.

Authors supply definitions and prerequisites; reviewers and adjudicators check them, source fidelity, and statistical qualifications. Reject undefined reasoning and fabricated certainty.

# Step 3 Alpha

**Proof formatting when editing items:** Separate numbered steps and the first
step after introductory prose with blank lines. Keep each complete step in one
paragraph, with single newlines inside it. End every step with valid `[tags]`;
put punctuation before the tags and use `[tags] ∎` on the final step. Preserve
mathematics and references. After final edits and any formatter, run once
before handoff: `node tools/physics-support/proof-layout.mjs items/<id>.md ...`, batching all
your changed item paths in one command.
Read-only assignments report defects without editing.

- **Proof repairs:** When editing an item, make every repair mathematically sound and as concise as the argument allows. State essential hypotheses and caveats; remove repetition and padding; add intermediate lemmas when needed to meet prerequisites.
- Read the dispatched task first. It defines your batches or cross-group obligations, outputs, and focused checks. The engine owns scheduling, routing, retries, coverage, gates, and stage transitions.
- Work only on routed work in your dispatch. Open dependencies outside scope only to assess assigned claims. At Step 3a, follow the generated batch item order from lowest to highest in-run dependency level; finish each item's routed decisions and risk review before moving higher. Review page-only obligations within their own scope.
- Route defects outside your dispatched batches through the task's alert or disposition path instead of repairing them yourself.
- Treat reader and refuter reports, gate diagnostics, and prior decisions as evidence, not verdicts. Re-read each current carrier, its cited dependencies, and relevant source statements. Review the authored argument, not the Step 3 scaffold checklist.
- Logical validity is the ground truth, as sources and judges can make mistakes. Never pretend to understand something you don't; escalate any uncertainty to the owner. Be impartial: accept sound mathematics without inventing defects, and do not claim repairs you cannot justify. For unfamiliar mathematics, search the web and read authoritative sources; record exact statements, checked hypotheses, and source locations.
- Check the written claim, hypotheses, quantifiers, exact cited statements, typing, and well-formedness. Test relevant empty, zero, endpoint, choice, and both directions of iff cases. Trace inferences to stated hypotheses, earlier steps, exact citations, or elementary derivations, preserving domains, quantifiers, hypotheses, direction, and conclusion.
- A proof-step gap that a competent reader closes immediately is nonfatal polish. It does not excuse a false or overstrong claim, definition, title, witness, computation, or citation. Do not manufacture findings or retain a known defect because repair is inconvenient.
- Use these verdicts: for `touched` or `page` carriers, `accepted_repair`, `amended_repair`, `reverted_change`, or `reviewed_no_defect`; for `reader` or `flagged` findings, `confirmed_fatal`, `confirmed_nonfatal`, or `false_positive`. A `false_positive` needs evidence and no unnecessary edits.
- Use `escalated` when a substantial unmet prerequisite blocks a sound local repair. Name the missing result, attempted closure, sources consulted, and required owner decision; leave the defect and risk review open. Never clear an escalation without owner resolution.
- For a known metadata normalization or audit enrichment, use `reviewed_no_defect`, set `change_kind` to `metadata` or `audit_enrichment`, and use `defect_ids: []`. This cannot close a reader, refuter, gate, or open ledger defect.
- An owner-authorized current-content resolution may address a missing historical preimage only after complete mathematical review of the current carrier and its actual prerequisites. Record `reviewed_no_defect`, `change_kind: "current_content_review"`, `historical_delta_unknown: true`, a nonempty `owner_resolution` of at least 40 characters explaining explicit owner authorization and durable evidence, and `defect_ids: []`. Preserve the prior escalation and historical uncertainty in the report; complete the current risk review. This cannot close a reader, refuter, gate, or open ledger defect, and current hash checks still apply.
- Repair a confirmed defect only when the repair is complete and justified. Make the smallest coherent correction and preserve the content contract. Set `repair_confidence: 1`; update every affected contract, manifest, provenance, risk review, and decision record; reflow and precheck every changed item. A material rewrite invalidates its prior `verification.judge` record.
- If an item's Statement or Definition changes, check every direct dependency and reference consumer's actual use. Make only necessary, surgical consumer repairs within your dispatched batches; route affected consumers outside those batches for Step 3b. Continue another hop only when a necessary repair changes that consumer's own Statement or Definition. Do not edit a sound consumer merely because it cites the supplier.
- Append one closed defect-ledger row per confirmed defect, owned at `caught_at_stage: "3a-adjudicate"` and referenced by its decision. Never create a defect row for a mechanical failure.
- Fully author necessary definitions and lemmas only in assigned existing A pages: prove each lemma, declare dependencies and exact AC uses, order suppliers before consumers, and update the manifest and contract. Do not add pairs or pages.
- For every HIGH or CRITICAL item, run `node tools/physics-support/risk-report.mjs` on its owning batch contract without `--require-reviewed`; read the current proof and reader/refuter and citation evidence; record a specific, complete `risk_review`; then rerun with `--require-reviewed`.
- Keep published content read-only. Record each defective published item in `research/published-consumer-supplier-ledger.md` with exact IDs, evidence, suppliers, status, and repair strategy; maintain its deduplicated classification index. Serialize edits by creating `research/.published-consumer-ledger.lock`, rereading and merging after acquiring it, then releasing only your own lock.
- Maintain `briefs/tasks/frontier-dependency-ledger.md` records for owned consumers. Preserve stable item IDs and keep proposed withdrawals present for the Step 3b lead to disposition.
- Write exactly the task-named report and decisions file, with one decision per owed obligation and an empty `decisions` array when none are owed. Never judge, stamp, self-certify, dispatch agents, or initiate a judge cycle; report local checks honestly. The engine stamps decision hashes and runs the gate battery after the dispatch.
- At Step 3b, follow `briefs/tasks/alpha-3b-edges.md`: reconcile computed cross-group obligations, append verdicts with current carrier hashes, close both impact windows with `tools/physics-support/impact-audit.mjs`, and report unresolved findings rather than claiming closure.
