# Physics content contract

This is a physics-workspace assignment. Read SCHEMA.md, CLAUDE.md, and
../PHYSICS-CONTENT-MODEL.md. The class-specific rules below override mathematical
proof-only wording in the inherited task:

- Use domain and library classifications, and dependency_roles on local items.
- postulate (post-): explicit adopted assumption, sources and physical_scope;
  review formulation, scope, sources, non_derivation. No proof required.
- experiment (exp-): reported setup, procedure, observations, uncertainty,
  interpretation and empirical_result. Review every field against retrieved
  source text. Do not fabricate observations or prove measured outcomes.
- physical-theorem (pthm-) and thought-experiment (texp-): identical complete
  conditional proofs, explicit physical_scope, and inherited empirical_premises.
- Mathematical items retain all ordinary mathematical proof obligations and
  cannot depend on physics. Imported mathematical items and pages are read-only.
- Nonproof item contracts use physics_review fields with verdict and concrete
  evidence as specified in SCHEMA.md; do not create fictitious proof worksheets.
- Relations (support/testing/motivation/replication/challenge) are not deps.
- Changes to Postulate, experimental setup/procedure/observations/uncertainty/interpretation, physical_scope, or empirical qualifications change the public physical interface and require direct-consumer review. Proofs, citations, and audit stamps alone do not propagate.
- Write only in this workspace. Never modify the root math engine, tools,
  briefs, items, or library. Any genuine math supplier defect is an escalation.

## Required experimental-evidence guidance

Before authoring, reviewing, judging, or adjudicating physical content, read
../PHYSICS-CONTENT-MODEL.md, especially "Statistical evidence and the double-slit
example". Apply its author/judge/adjudicator instructions to every statistical
claim. Separate theoretical distributions, finite observed data, and statistical
inference. Finite agreement does not prove a physical framework, and a rare
outcome or missing visible fringe does not automatically falsify one. Classical
waves also interfere: identify the specific competing model and apparatus
assumptions. Never invent sample sizes, uncertainties, p-values, or power.
Confidence in a source review or conditional proof is not certainty that a theory
is true. Carry sampling and measurement qualifications into downstream claims.

# Assigned content repair

**Proof formatting when editing items:** Separate numbered steps and the first
step after introductory prose with blank lines. Keep each complete step in one
paragraph, with single newlines inside it. End every step with valid `[tags]`;
put punctuation before the tags and use `[tags] ∎` on the final step. Preserve
mathematics and references. After final edits and any formatter, run once
before handoff: `node tools/physics-support/proof-layout.mjs items/<id>.md ...`, batching all
your changed item paths in one command.
Read-only assignments report defects without editing.

**Proof repair quality for item editors.** When editing an item file, make every proof repair mathematically sound and as concise as the argument allows. State essential hypotheses and important caveats clearly; remove repeated talking points, filler, and padding that add no mathematical content. Add intermediate lemmas to satisfy unmet prerequisite if possible.

Repair only the items or contracts licensed by the task. Read CLAUDE.md,
SCHEMA.md, current arguments and actual dependencies. Be honest about your
understanding; consult authoritative web sources whenever unsure. Escalate
unresolved mathematics, missing authority and substantial unmet prerequisites.

Write complete arguments and item-specific evidence, not scaffold strategies
or generic contract rows. Preserve claims, IDs, provenance and source qualifiers.
Report potential published defects with exact evidence to the owner; do not
edit published content without explicit task authority. Run focused checks and
checkpoint the actual changes, source locators, results and remaining gaps.
