# Physics content contract

This is a physics-workspace assignment. Read SCHEMA.md, CLAUDE.md, and
../PHYSICS-CONTENT-MODEL.md. The class-specific rules below override mathematical
proof-only wording in the inherited task:

- Use domain and library classifications, and dependency_roles on local items.
- postulate (post-): explicit adopted assumption, sources and physical_scope;
  review formulation, scope, sources, non_derivation. No proof required.
- experiment (exp-): reported setup, procedure, observations, uncertainty,
  interpretation and empirical_result. Review every field against retrieved
  source text. Do not fabricate observations or prove measured outcomes.
- physical-theorem (pthm-) and thought-experiment (texp-): identical complete
  conditional proofs, explicit physical_scope, and inherited empirical_premises.
- Mathematical items retain all ordinary mathematical proof obligations and
  cannot depend on physics. Imported mathematical items and pages are read-only.
- Nonproof item contracts use physics_review fields with verdict and concrete
  evidence as specified in SCHEMA.md; do not create fictitious proof worksheets.
- Relations (support/testing/motivation/replication/challenge) are not deps.
- Changes to Postulate, experimental setup/procedure/observations/uncertainty/interpretation, physical_scope, or empirical qualifications change the public physical interface and require direct-consumer review. Proofs, citations, and audit stamps alone do not propagate.
- Write only in this workspace. Never modify the root math engine, tools,
  briefs, items, or library. Any genuine math supplier defect is an escalation.

## Required experimental-evidence guidance

Before authoring, reviewing, judging, or adjudicating physical content, read
../PHYSICS-CONTENT-MODEL.md, especially "Statistical evidence and the double-slit
example". Apply its author/judge/adjudicator instructions to every statistical
claim. Separate theoretical distributions, finite observed data, and statistical
inference. Finite agreement does not prove a physical framework, and a rare
outcome or missing visible fringe does not automatically falsify one. Classical
waves also interfere: identify the specific competing model and apparatus
assumptions. Never invent sample sizes, uncertainties, p-values, or power.
Confidence in a source review or conditional proof is not certainty that a theory
is true. Carry sampling and measurement qualifications into downstream claims.

# Step 5a refuter

**Proof repair quality for item editors.** When editing an item file, make every proof repair mathematically sound and as concise as the argument allows. State essential hypotheses and important caveats clearly; remove repeated talking points, filler, and padding that add no mathematical content. Add intermediate lemmas to satisfy unmet prerequisite if possible.

- Work read-only: never edit a file, judge, stamp, widen the assigned scope, or request permissions.
- Read the task and `research/<run>-step5-scope-<i>.json`; its `refuter_scope` is the exact set of items and page carriers you owe.
- Read every listed carrier exactly once and open any dependency needed to test an assigned claim.
- Treat the reader report as evidence, not proof; verify each result from the current files.
- Check claims, definitions, titles, facts, proofs, witnesses, computations, and remarks.
- Trace inferences; open a cited dependency before calling it too weak; preserve cited domains, quantifiers, hypotheses, directions, and conclusions; type-check expressions; and test the empty, zero, endpoint, choice, and iff cases.
- Treat a small proof-step gap that a competent reader closes immediately as nonfatal; it never excuses a defective claim, definition, title, witness, computation, or citation.
- Return only the schema-conforming JSON object, with `opened` equal to the computed `refuter_scope` and `not_opened: []`; the coverage gate blocks otherwise.
- Report in `flagged` only concrete in-scope defects, each with its exact location, defect class, evidence, and severity; `flagged: []` is the correct result of a complete skeptical read with no concrete defect.
- State what you checked and any genuine limitation in `coverage_note`; never claim a read you did not perform.
