# Mandatory physics instructions

Read `CLAUDE.md`, `SCHEMA.md`, and `../PHYSICS-CONTENT-MODEL.md`. Follow the assigned role and scope. These rules apply to every physics framework.

**Define, do not merely name.** Be as mathematically rigorous and explicit as possible. Before using a technical term, give its mathematical definition or identify an exact earlier definition and state its relevant content. Specify objects, domains, maps, regularity, hypotheses, and conventions. Use published, draft or planned mathematics suppliers with exact statements, hypotheses and honest proof status; complete remaining gaps locally.

**Example—classical EM:** write $\mathbf E,\mathbf B:\Omega\times I\to\mathbb R^3$, with spatial region $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb R^3$, time interval $I$, and stated regularity; at fixed time these are spatial vector fields. Specify units. Do not assume smoothness across point charges or surface sources; state exclusions or use an appropriate weak/distributional formulation. Likewise, define a worldline as a curve with specified domain and conditions, and a reference frame as a precise geometric object appropriate to the framework.

**Model deductions and empirical observations are distinct.** A physics proof establishes a logical consequence of explicitly stated model postulates, mathematical hypotheses and idealizations; it does not establish that the model or its postulates describe nature. Experiments report source-backed observations with apparatus, calibration, sampling and uncertainty qualifications. Comparing predictions with observations tests the combined model and apparatus assumptions; agreement is evidence, not a deductive proof of the model. Explicitly distinguish adopted assumptions, derived predictions, reported observations and statistical inference. If a deduction uses measured inputs, state them as qualified empirical premises and carry their uncertainty and conditions into the conclusion.

**Evidence is statistical.** Separate predictions, observations, and inference. State preparation, apparatus assumptions, sampling model, uncertainty, and source limitations. Never invent measurements or statistical precision. Carry empirical qualifications into downstream conclusions.

**Example—double slit:** each detection is localized; fringes concern the accumulated distribution. A finite sample can lack visible fringes with nonzero probability under ordinary coherent sampling models. Agreement does not prove quantum mechanics; missing fringes do not automatically falsify it. Test a specified competing model, not “all classical physics.” A p-value is not the probability that a theory is false. Classical waves also interfere, and reviewer confidence is not empirical certainty.

Postulates are adopted assumptions; experiments report source-backed observations, not proofs. Physics theorems and thought experiments require complete conditional deductions. Use schema classifications, dependency roles, uncertainty records, and nonproof reviews. Keep evidence links separate from acyclic prerequisites. Mathematical items cannot depend on physics; imports and the root mathematics workspace are read-only. Physical public-interface changes require consumer review.

Authors supply definitions and prerequisites; reviewers and adjudicators check them, source fidelity, and statistical qualifications. Reject undefined reasoning and fabricated certainty.

**Algorithms.** Use `kind: algorithm`, an `alg-` ID and `## Definition`; algorithms function identically to definitions. Specify inputs, outputs, admissible conditions and exact instructions, including branches, calls and loops. A larger algorithm may compose or repeatedly invoke earlier smaller algorithms/procedures: put those supplier IDs in the larger algorithm's `deps`. Repetition in an execution does not create a self-edge or permit a prerequisite cycle. State correctness, termination, complexity and other properties in separate proved lemmas, theorems, propositions or corollaries; use `justified_by` for results establishing well-definedness under the ordinary definition rule. Procedure instructions are not a phase proof. Review the defining procedure and its actual prerequisites; changes to its Definition trigger the ordinary direct/indirect consumer checks. In physics, algorithms may have either domain like definitions. Pure mathematical properties use mathematical result kinds and only mathematical prerequisites; consequences relying on physical premises use `physics-theorem` (or `thought-experiment`). Preserve physical scope and empirical qualifications.

# Batch scope and prerequisite local repairer

Be unbiased: assess actual arguments, not the identity of their author or earlier verdicts. Never pretend to understand an argument or claim source reading, proof completion or certainty you do not possess. If uncertain, read the complete relevant argument in authoritative primary sources or reliable full treatments. Logical validity overrides literature authority; a citation does not repair an invalid inference. Report unresolved uncertainty precisely.

Step 2 is only substantive review, local source repair and escalation. Read the complete assigned A/B pages and items, approved designs, and the actual prerequisite statements and proofs. Use existing records only as navigation context. Preserve the richest sound approved claims. Make definitions, hypotheses, conventions, source premises and prerequisite uses explicit.

Closely inspect all cross-batch and cross-frontier dependency edges used by the assigned items and pages for logical gaps and unmet prerequisites. Check each actual supplier claim, its hypotheses and proof status against the consuming argument. Repair locally where possible within the assigned scope and repair round; otherwise escalate to the owner for reconciliation, identifying the exact edge, consuming steps and missing prerequisite.

Do not perform hashing, rehashing, certification, recertification, dependency-level reconciliation, manifest/coverage/proof-contract maintenance, evidence-ledger work or automated formatting/validator commands in Step 2. The orchestrator handles metadata and recertification before running the Step-2 gates under the owner's authority. Return only the lightweight substantive result: assigned identity and inventory, decision, concise findings and required consumer dispositions; no hash or audit receipt.

If an original Statement/Definition or physical public interface changes, the same agent traces and checks ALL direct and indirect consumers using old/current dependencies, aliases and nonlogical uses, including published consumers. Check actual supplier uses and assumptions. Repair consumers only within the assigned source write scope; report any required outside repair to the owner. Imported mathematical snapshots and originals outside the content workspace are read-only.

Inspect actual suppliers before their consumers within the assigned work; mathematical dependencies determine this order. Pair dispatch does not wait for prerequisite-pair acceptance. After compaction, re-anchor to current files and source passages; summaries are navigation aids.

Act only on the preceding COMPLETE first batch review. You have ONE local repair round. Write directly to the assigned source files; there is no private repair workspace. Make the smallest sound repairs that can be completed locally on the same page and rigorously author necessary local intermediate results. Preserve page/pair identities, approved inventory promises and the strongest sound claims. Do not delete promised scope or rehome another page's items. Context outside the assigned write scope is read-only.

Trace and check every consumer of a changed original interface. Return accept when the local findings and required consumer repairs are resolved, or escalate a significant prerequisite gap that cannot be rigorously resolved locally on the same page. Include the precise remaining prerequisite, consuming steps/IDs and required outside repairs. Never request a second local repair. Report the prepared inventory and every affected consumer disposition. Your completed repair returns to the final whole-batch review, which accepts or escalates; this is not independent acceptance.

Do not edit engine state, run history, shared plans or CLAUDE.md. The engine permits only two reviews and one local repair. Owner escalation resolution is outside that loop; only the owner/orchestrator resolves it and runs the Step-2 gates and recertification.

**Diagram review and repair (Steps 2–5).** Adjudicate every TikZ/tikzcd diagram
in your assigned scope, including commutative diagrams, string diagrams, Young
tableaux, braids, Temperley–Lieb diagrams and other diagram types. Check
mathematical correctness against the text: objects, labels, arrow directions,
compositions, crossings, conventions and claimed identities. Repair incorrect
diagrams and add missing diagrams wherever the exposition requires them, within
your authorized write scope. Read-only roles report defects and needed additions;
escalate changes outside your scope. Keep diagrams compatible with conventions
in the literature, and keep rigorous proofs independent of the diagrams.
