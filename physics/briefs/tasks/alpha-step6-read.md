# Physics content contract

This is a physics-workspace assignment. Read SCHEMA.md, CLAUDE.md, and
../PHYSICS-CONTENT-MODEL.md. The class-specific rules below override mathematical
proof-only wording in the inherited task:

- Use domain and library classifications, and dependency_roles on local items.
- postulate (post-): explicit adopted assumption, sources and physical_scope;
  review formulation, scope, sources, non_derivation. No proof required.
- experiment (exp-): reported setup, procedure, observations, uncertainty,
  interpretation and empirical_result. Review every field against retrieved
  source text. Do not fabricate observations or prove measured outcomes.
- physical-theorem (pthm-) and thought-experiment (texp-): identical complete
  conditional proofs, explicit physical_scope, and inherited empirical_premises.
- Mathematical items retain all ordinary mathematical proof obligations and
  cannot depend on physics. Imported mathematical items and pages are read-only.
- Nonproof item contracts use physics_review fields with verdict and concrete
  evidence as specified in SCHEMA.md; do not create fictitious proof worksheets.
- Relations (support/testing/motivation/replication/challenge) are not deps.
- Changes to Postulate, experimental setup/procedure/observations/uncertainty/interpretation, physical_scope, or empirical qualifications change the public physical interface and require direct-consumer review. Proofs, citations, and audit stamps alone do not propagate.
- Write only in this workspace. Never modify the root math engine, tools,
  briefs, items, or library. Any genuine math supplier defect is an escalation.

## Required experimental-evidence guidance

Before authoring, reviewing, judging, or adjudicating physical content, read
../PHYSICS-CONTENT-MODEL.md, especially "Statistical evidence and the double-slit
example". Apply its author/judge/adjudicator instructions to every statistical
claim. Separate theoretical distributions, finite observed data, and statistical
inference. Finite agreement does not prove a physical framework, and a rare
outcome or missing visible fringe does not automatically falsify one. Classical
waves also interfere: identify the specific competing model and apparatus
assumptions. Never invent sample sizes, uncertainties, p-values, or power.
Confidence in a source review or conditional proof is not certainty that a theory
is true. Carry sampling and measurement qualifications into downstream claims.

# Step 6 Alpha group reader — read-only digest, `{{run}}`

- **Role and scope:** You are the Step 6 Alpha group reader for the assigned group in the generated group header. Read every assigned page and item, its cited published dependencies, and every listed cross-group seam.
- **Dependency order:** Read items in the correct dependency order across the entire assigned group: suppliers before their direct and indirect consumers. Review each cited prerequisite before the consuming claim, including prerequisites outside the group.
- **Read-only work:** Record concerns and alerts without repairing anything.
- **Return only the supplied Step-7 context JSON.** Its `pages_read`, `items_read`, and `seams_checked` must be exact inventories of the generated scope. Include the group's conventions, load-bearing items, opened published dependencies, and concrete concerns. Empty `concerns` and `alerts` arrays are valid.
- **Escape JSON strings correctly:** Every backslash is an escape, so write a LaTeX command with a doubled backslash (`\\perp`, `\\omega`), never a single backslash (`\perp`). An invalid escape invalidates the whole digest. Prefer plain text or Unicode (⊥, ω, ≤, ∈) when suitable.
- **Keep inventories exact:** `pages_read` must contain exactly the IDs under **Your pages**, and `items_read` exactly the IDs under **Your content**, with no extras. Opening a published dependency does not expand either inventory; record it only under `published_dependencies`.
- **Route other-group findings correctly:** Put a finding about another group's item in `alerts`, not `concerns`; the scope tool routes it to that item's owning group before adjudication.
