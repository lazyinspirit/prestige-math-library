# Physics content contract

This is a physics-workspace assignment. Read SCHEMA.md, CLAUDE.md, and
../PHYSICS-CONTENT-MODEL.md. The class-specific rules below override mathematical
proof-only wording in the inherited task:

- Use domain and library classifications, and dependency_roles on local items.
- postulate (post-): explicit adopted assumption, sources and physical_scope;
  review formulation, scope, sources, non_derivation. No proof required.
- experiment (exp-): reported setup, procedure, observations, uncertainty,
  interpretation and empirical_result. Review every field against retrieved
  source text. Do not fabricate observations or prove measured outcomes.
- physical-theorem (pthm-) and thought-experiment (texp-): identical complete
  conditional proofs, explicit physical_scope, and inherited empirical_premises.
- Mathematical items retain all ordinary mathematical proof obligations and
  cannot depend on physics. Imported mathematical items and pages are read-only.
- Nonproof item contracts use physics_review fields with verdict and concrete
  evidence as specified in SCHEMA.md; do not create fictitious proof worksheets.
- Relations (support/testing/motivation/replication/challenge) are not deps.
- Changes to Postulate, experimental setup/procedure/observations/uncertainty/interpretation, physical_scope, or empirical qualifications change the public physical interface and require direct-consumer review. Proofs, citations, and audit stamps alone do not propagate.
- Write only in this workspace. Never modify the root math engine, tools,
  briefs, items, or library. Any genuine math supplier defect is an escalation.

## Required experimental-evidence guidance

Before authoring, reviewing, judging, or adjudicating physical content, read
../PHYSICS-CONTENT-MODEL.md, especially "Statistical evidence and the double-slit
example". Apply its author/judge/adjudicator instructions to every statistical
claim. Separate theoretical distributions, finite observed data, and statistical
inference. Finite agreement does not prove a physical framework, and a rare
outcome or missing visible fringe does not automatically falsify one. Classical
waves also interfere: identify the specific competing model and apparatus
assumptions. Never invent sample sizes, uncertainties, p-values, or power.
Confidence in a source review or conditional proof is not certainty that a theory
is true. Carry sampling and measurement qualifications into downstream claims.

# Step 1 — scaffold construction

**Proof repair quality for item editors.** When editing an item file, make every proof repair mathematically sound and as concise as the argument allows. State essential hypotheses and important caveats clearly; remove repeated talking points, filler, and padding that add no mathematical content. Add intermediate lemmas to satisfy unmet prerequisite if possible.

- Read CLAUDE.md, SCHEMA.md, WORKFLOW.md, the assigned task/designs, current plan and batch evidence. If `research/<run>-owner-authoring-direction.md` exists, read it before constructing any item; it is binding and overrides stale task or design text. The plan controls other design conflicts; record the conflict.
- Write only assigned manifests, coverage, notes, item-readiness records and consumer-batch dependency inputs. Do not edit published content, shared plans, engine state or verdicts.
- Build each item once in prerequisite order. Preserve unchanged ready items. Record an outcome before moving to the next item.
- Label every scaffold manifest item with `dependency_level`. Use level 0 when it has no dependencies on items in this run; otherwise use one plus the maximum level of its in-run `deps`. Published and other out-of-run suppliers do not raise this level. Recompute affected labels after adding or changing dependencies; a cycle is an escalation, never an arbitrary level. Run `node tools/physics-support/item-dependency-levels.mjs check --run RUN` after the batch's suppliers are scaffolded.
- Verify actual transitive proof dependencies, including implicit uses and well-definedness. Read the necessary statements and proofs; check hypotheses, direction, conventions and axiom strength. Allow no missing, circular, forward or inadequate dependency; page membership and publication status are not proof checks.
- Add every necessary local definition, lemma and proof strategy before its consumers. Use stable unused IDs and explicit `deps` arrays. Never weaken useful claims or pad inventories; escalate required page splits.
- You are responsible for mathematical closure of every assigned pair. Create as many prerequisite items as needed to prove every claim soundly, preferably on the same A page as the result they support. Each page has a hard 100-item cap; do not exceed it or omit prerequisites to fit. Escalate to the owner when a prerequisite is better placed in another batch or when the complete local closure would exceed the cap.
- Escalate cross-batch changes or new prerequisite pairs with exact placement, A/B inventories, sources and dependency chains. Do not change selected pairs or treat planned suppliers as published.
- State AC where needed, declare its dependency and identify its use; preserve choice-free and incompatible-axiom branches. Never consume Recorded results to prove their replacements; Foundations must not reach `deferred-set-theory-beyond-choice` through any proof or prerequisite path.
- Record published defects in owned notes with exact item IDs, evidence, planned suppliers, publication states and repair strategies for the canonical ledger. Unrelated published consumer debt does not block a new supplier; defective actual prerequisites do.
- Maintain cross-batch dependencies under `briefs/tasks/frontier-dependency-ledger.md`.

## Sources

- Search authoritative web sources for unfamiliar mathematics and read complete relevant arguments. Prefer primary papers, author-hosted books/notes and official references.
- Normally use two independent treatments per A page, including a book, monograph or full lecture-note set. Record URLs, exact locators and supported items.
- Give every harvested result a disposition: included/inline with item ID, deferred with a valid destination, or out of scope with a specific reason.
- Verify actual full text using `source-fetch-check --stamp` and inspection; snippets, previews and HTTP 200 are insufficient.
- After an initial retrieval failure, search alternate locations and retry recovery at most five times. Stop on success. Reuse genuine attempts; do not restart the retry allowance in another dispatch.
- After five failed retries, either construct a complete alternative proof with all necessary local dependencies, or escalate to the owner. Use accessible authoritative treatments when helpful. Do not claim an outage proves permanent unavailability.
- Use an alternative only with full mathematical confidence. Preserve every result and hypothesis, align arguments with the manifest, and reharvest replacement sources separately.
- Retain the original source and dispositions as history. A confident alternative requires `source_resolution`: `status: dropped`, `decided_by: step-1-scaffolder`, `confidence: certain`, `reason`, `search_summary`, `searches: [{query, outcome}]`, `attempts: [{url, at, outcome}]` (initial failure plus five retries), and `alternatives: [{item, argument, deps}]` for every included/inline result.
- Otherwise set `source_resolution.status: owner-escalation`, record the URL, attempts and exact uncertainty, and mark affected items escalated. Continue other items.
- A valid drop waives the original source and any source-count shortfall, not mathematical coverage or dependency checks. Never fabricate confidence or fetch evidence.

## Completion

- Record `ready` only when the item has a complete proof strategy and adequate met prerequisites; otherwise record `escalated`. Include examined dependency IDs and evidence in each record.
- Use `node tools/physics-support/step1-decisions.mjs record --run RUN --item ID --decision ready|escalated --dependencies JSON --reason TEXT`. Never use `--owner` or overwrite an escalation.
- Run coverage, whole-run manifest dependencies/policy, plan, external-reference and source checks. Record actual results and unresolved findings in batch notes.
- Owner/operator reconciliation and the full engine gate follow construction; neither a worker exit nor a readiness record is independent mathematical approval. Step 3 provides that review.
