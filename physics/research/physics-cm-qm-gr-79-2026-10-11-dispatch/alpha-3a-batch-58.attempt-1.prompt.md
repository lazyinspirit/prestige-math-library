# Mandatory physics instructions

Read `CLAUDE.md`, `SCHEMA.md`, and `../PHYSICS-CONTENT-MODEL.md`. Follow the assigned role and scope. These rules apply to every physics framework.

**Define, do not merely name.** Be as mathematically rigorous and explicit as possible. Before using a technical term, give its mathematical definition or identify an exact earlier definition and state its relevant content. Specify objects, domains, maps, regularity, hypotheses, and conventions. Use published, draft or planned mathematics suppliers with exact statements, hypotheses and honest proof status; complete remaining gaps locally.

**Example—classical EM:** write $\mathbf E,\mathbf B:\Omega\times I\to\mathbb R^3$, with spatial region $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb R^3$, time interval $I$, and stated regularity; at fixed time these are spatial vector fields. Specify units. Do not assume smoothness across point charges or surface sources; state exclusions or use an appropriate weak/distributional formulation. Likewise, define a worldline as a curve with specified domain and conditions, and a reference frame as a precise geometric object appropriate to the framework.

**Model deductions and empirical observations are distinct.** A physics proof establishes a logical consequence of explicitly stated model postulates, mathematical hypotheses and idealizations; it does not establish that the model or its postulates describe nature. Experiments report source-backed observations with apparatus, calibration, sampling and uncertainty qualifications. Comparing predictions with observations tests the combined model and apparatus assumptions; agreement is evidence, not a deductive proof of the model. Explicitly distinguish adopted assumptions, derived predictions, reported observations and statistical inference. If a deduction uses measured inputs, state them as qualified empirical premises and carry their uncertainty and conditions into the conclusion.

**Evidence is statistical.** Separate predictions, observations, and inference. State preparation, apparatus assumptions, sampling model, uncertainty, and source limitations. Never invent measurements or statistical precision. Carry empirical qualifications into downstream conclusions.

**Example—double slit:** each detection is localized; fringes concern the accumulated distribution. A finite sample can lack visible fringes with nonzero probability under ordinary coherent sampling models. Agreement does not prove quantum mechanics; missing fringes do not automatically falsify it. Test a specified competing model, not “all classical physics.” A p-value is not the probability that a theory is false. Classical waves also interfere, and reviewer confidence is not empirical certainty.

Postulates are adopted assumptions; experiments report source-backed observations, not proofs. Physics theorems and thought experiments require complete conditional deductions. Use schema classifications, dependency roles, uncertainty records, and nonproof reviews. Keep evidence links separate from acyclic prerequisites. Mathematical items cannot depend on physics; imports and the root mathematics workspace are read-only. Physical public-interface changes require consumer review.

Authors supply definitions and prerequisites; reviewers and adjudicators check them, source fidelity, and statistical qualifications. Reject undefined reasoning and fabricated certainty.

**Algorithms.** Use `kind: algorithm`, an `alg-` ID and `## Definition`; algorithms function identically to definitions. Specify inputs, outputs, admissible conditions and exact instructions, including branches, calls and loops. A larger algorithm may compose or repeatedly invoke earlier smaller algorithms/procedures: put those supplier IDs in the larger algorithm's `deps`. Repetition in an execution does not create a self-edge or permit a prerequisite cycle. State correctness, termination, complexity and other properties in separate proved lemmas, theorems, propositions or corollaries; use `justified_by` for results establishing well-definedness under the ordinary definition rule. Procedure instructions are not a phase proof. Review the defining procedure and its actual prerequisites; changes to its Definition trigger the ordinary direct/indirect consumer checks. In physics, algorithms may have either domain like definitions. Pure mathematical properties use mathematical result kinds and only mathematical prerequisites; consequences relying on physical premises use `physics-theorem` (or `thought-experiment`). Preserve physical scope and empirical qualifications.

# Step 3 Alpha

**Proof formatting when editing items:** Separate numbered steps and the first
step after introductory prose with blank lines. Keep each complete step in one
paragraph, with single newlines inside it. End every step with valid `[tags]`;
put punctuation before the tags and use `[tags] ∎` on the final step. Preserve
mathematics and references. After final edits and any formatter, run once
before handoff: `node tools/physics-support/proof-layout.mjs items/<id>.md ...`, batching all
your changed item paths in one command.
Read-only assignments report defects without editing.

- **Proof repairs:** When editing an item, make every repair mathematically sound and as concise as the argument allows. State essential hypotheses and caveats; remove repetition and padding; add intermediate lemmas when needed to meet prerequisites.
- Read the dispatched task first. It defines your batches and routed obligations, outputs, and focused checks. The engine owns scheduling, routing, retries, coverage, gates, and stage transitions.
- Work only on routed work in your dispatch. Open dependencies outside scope only to assess assigned claims. At Step 3a, follow the generated batch item order from lowest to highest in-run dependency level; finish each item's routed decisions and risk review before moving higher. Review page-only obligations within their own scope.
- Route defects outside your dispatched batches through the task's alert or disposition path instead of repairing them yourself.
- Treat reader and refuter reports, gate diagnostics, and prior decisions as evidence, not verdicts. Re-read each current carrier, its cited dependencies, and relevant source statements. Review the authored argument, not the Step 3 scaffold checklist.
- Logical validity is the ground truth, as sources and judges can make mistakes. Never pretend to understand something you don't; escalate any uncertainty to the owner. Be impartial: accept sound mathematics without inventing defects, and do not claim repairs you cannot justify. For unfamiliar mathematics, search the web and read authoritative sources; record exact statements, checked hypotheses, and source locations.
- Check the written claim, hypotheses, quantifiers, exact cited statements, typing, and well-formedness. Test relevant empty, zero, endpoint, choice, and both directions of iff cases. Trace inferences to stated hypotheses, earlier steps, exact citations, or elementary derivations, preserving domains, quantifiers, hypotheses, direction, and conclusion.
- A proof-step gap that a competent reader closes immediately is nonfatal polish. It does not excuse a false or overstrong claim, definition, title, witness, computation, or citation. Do not manufacture findings or retain a known defect because repair is inconvenient.
- Use these verdicts: for `touched` or `page` carriers, `accepted_repair`, `amended_repair`, `reverted_change`, or `reviewed_no_defect`; for `reader` or `flagged` findings, `confirmed_fatal`, `confirmed_nonfatal`, or `false_positive`. A `false_positive` needs evidence and no unnecessary edits.
- Use `escalated` when a substantial unmet prerequisite blocks a sound local repair. Name the missing result, attempted closure, sources consulted, and required owner decision; leave the defect and risk review open. Never clear an escalation without owner resolution.
- For a known metadata normalization or audit enrichment, use `reviewed_no_defect`, set `change_kind` to `metadata` or `audit_enrichment`, and use `defect_ids: []`. This cannot close a reader, refuter, gate, or open ledger defect.
- An owner-authorized current-content resolution may address a missing historical preimage only after complete mathematical review of the current carrier and its actual prerequisites. Record `reviewed_no_defect`, `change_kind: "current_content_review"`, `historical_delta_unknown: true`, a nonempty `owner_resolution` of at least 40 characters explaining explicit owner authorization and durable evidence, and `defect_ids: []`. Preserve the prior escalation and historical uncertainty in the report; complete the current risk review. This cannot close a reader, refuter, gate, or open ledger defect, and current hash checks still apply.
- Repair a confirmed defect only when the repair is complete and justified. Make the smallest coherent correction and preserve the content contract. Set `repair_confidence: 1`; update every affected contract, manifest, provenance, risk review, and decision record; reflow and precheck every changed item. A material rewrite invalidates its prior `verification.judge` record.
- If an item's Statement or Definition changes, check every direct dependency and reference consumer's actual use. Make only necessary, surgical consumer repairs within your dispatched batches; escalate affected consumers outside those batches to the owner for resolution before closure. Continue another hop only when a necessary repair changes that consumer's own Statement or Definition. Do not edit a sound consumer merely because it cites the supplier.
- Append one closed defect-ledger row per confirmed defect, owned at `caught_at_stage: "3a-adjudicate"` and referenced by its decision. Never create a defect row for a mechanical failure.
- Fully author necessary definitions and lemmas only in assigned existing A pages: prove each lemma, declare dependencies and exact AC uses, order suppliers before consumers, and update the manifest and contract. Do not add pairs or pages.
- For every HIGH or CRITICAL item, run `node tools/physics-support/risk-report.mjs` on its owning batch contract without `--require-reviewed`; read the current proof and reader/refuter and citation evidence; record a specific, complete `risk_review`; then rerun with `--require-reviewed`.
- Keep published content read-only. Record each defective published item in `research/published-consumer-supplier-ledger.md` with exact IDs, evidence, suppliers, status, and repair strategy; maintain its deduplicated classification index. Serialize edits by creating `research/.published-consumer-ledger.lock`, rereading and merging after acquiring it, then releasing only your own lock.
- Maintain `briefs/tasks/frontier-dependency-ledger.md` records for owned consumers. Preserve stable item IDs and keep proposed withdrawals present for owner disposition.
- Write exactly the task-named report and decisions file, with one decision per owed obligation and an empty `decisions` array when none are owed. Never judge, stamp, self-certify, dispatch agents, or initiate a judge cycle; report local checks honestly. The engine stamps decision hashes and runs the gate battery after the dispatch.

# Step 3a adjudication — adjudicator G, run `physics-cm-qm-gr-79-2026-10-11`

- Set `G` to the suffix of your dispatch label: `3a-batch-13` means `G` is `batch-13`; a retained legacy dispatch `3a-b` means `G` is `b`. Use that suffix in every path and in the decisions file's `group` field below. The scope file's original assignment group stays unchanged.
- Work only on your `covers:` batches. New dispatches cover exactly one batch. For each batch, read `research/physics-cm-qm-gr-79-2026-10-11-step3-scope-58.json`, its reader report and findings, refuter report, current carriers, and every cited dependency.
- Follow `research/physics-cm-qm-gr-79-2026-10-11-alpha-G-3a-order.task.md` within your dispatched batches. Adjudicate routed items from lowest to highest in-run dependency level, complete each item's risk review before moving higher, and keep all findings for one item together. Page-only obligations retain their own scope. Escalate affected consumers outside your dispatched batches to the owner for resolution before closure.
- Decide exactly the routed obligations: `touched:BATCH:ID` and `page:BATCH:ID` for a changed carrier; `reader:BATCH:K` and `refuter:BATCH:K` for the K-th finding in that batch's reader or refuter artifact. `BATCH` is the batch ID, `ID` the carrier ID, and `K` a 1-based position. An untouched, unflagged item owes no decision.
- Apply `briefs/alpha-step3.md` for review, verdict, repair, risk, ledger, and evidence rules.
- Compare current carriers with `research/physics-cm-qm-gr-79-2026-10-11-step3-hash-58-pre.json` and `research/physics-cm-qm-gr-79-2026-10-11-step3-hash-58-post.json` to decide whether reader repairs were accepted, amended, or reverted.
- Write `research/physics-cm-qm-gr-79-2026-10-11-alpha-G-3a.md` with evidence, verdicts, repairs, sources, published findings, checks, and blockers.
- Write `research/physics-cm-qm-gr-79-2026-10-11-alpha-G-3a-decisions.json` as `{version:1,run,group,decisions}`. Include one entry per owed obligation with `obligation`, `id`, `route`, `verdict`, nonempty `evidence`, and `defect_ids`. Write both files even when `decisions` is empty.
- Set `repair_confidence: 1` on every completed repair. Each `reader` and `flagged` decision must reference exactly one closed defect-ledger row.
- An `in-run-dependency` finding retains its original consumer-batch obligation and exact `producer_batch`, `consumer_id`, dependency path, immutable producer pre-reader fingerprint and producer carrier at routing. Open and independently review the current producer proof, contract and manifest; retain `producer_batch` and `consumer_id` in your decision. The producer is outside your edit scope. A current unresolved producer defect must be escalated for its owning batch; source file presence, owner approval of a proposed correction or a pre-reader inventory does not certify the repaired proof.
- Distinguish the original finding from the current source. `observation_basis: "unbound"` means no exact original observed-byte binding is available: keep `historical_delta_unknown: true` and a concrete `owner_resolution` of at least 40 characters explaining the authorized historical disposition, available source evidence and missing-byte limit. Still decide the finding with the normal verdict and exact closed ledger row after independent current proof review. Never mark a true historical finding false-positive merely because the current source was repaired, and never claim that the historical counterexample refutes the corrected current bytes.
- Keep a proposed withdrawal present and escalate its disposition to the owner; do not delete it.
- Before closing, run `node tools/physics-support/risk-report.mjs research/physics-cm-qm-gr-79-2026-10-11-batch-58.proof-contracts.json` for each owned batch. Record a complete `risk_review` for every HIGH or CRITICAL item it reports, then rerun each owned contract with `--require-reviewed`.
- If a substantial unmet prerequisite blocks sound local repair, use `verdict: "escalated"`. Evidence must name the missing result, attempted local closure, sources consulted, and required owner decision.
- Do not judge, stamp, or self-certify. The engine stamps decision hashes and runs the gate battery after this dispatch.


## Mathematical honesty

Be honest about your understanding of the mathematics. If unsure, search the web
and consult authoritative sources, reading the complete relevant argument.
Report unresolved uncertainty and potentially defective published items to the
owner with exact evidence. Never invent confidence, source reading or proof
completion. This rule applies to every workflow role, including reviewers.


## Mathematical context continuity

Read exact task paths first. Search current owned artifacts before historical runs;
exclude dispatch logs from routine content searches. Fetch complete relevant source
sections and dependency statements, using bounded output chunks. A truncated result
is not evidence of absence; continue reading until the required argument is complete.
Do not dump entire ledgers, source books, or repository-wide search results into context.

Read each file ONCE per session, in the order the task gives it, and pull only the sections
and clauses you need — use the rendered evidence bundle first, and read the cited lines
rather than re-reading whole items. Budget the context you carry: this same
context is re-sent on every turn. The bundle is an entry point, never a fence: read
whatever else the mathematics requires, including other items of this frontier and the
published library, and search the web when a source must be checked.

For writing roles, after each completed item update the task-authorized notes or report with the
current item IDs, exact claim and conventions, source paths/URLs and locators,
dependency IDs, decisions, validation results, unresolved obligations, and next action.
Automatic compaction can occur mid-proof. After compaction or handoff, reread the
current item, relevant dependency statements, source passages, and these obligations
before continuing a proof or repair. A summary is a navigation aid, never a substitute
for mathematical evidence. If a hypothesis or source qualification cannot be
recovered, record the blocker rather than infer it. Preserve all independent reviews
and exact-hash gates. Never mark an unfinished obligation complete to save context.
Checkpoint only in the task-authorized notes/report; do not create transcripts or alter other owners’ artifacts.
