## Definition

A topological space $X$ is **paracompact** when every open cover $\mathcal U$
of $X$ has an open refinement $\mathcal V$ which covers $X$ and is locally
finite. In symbols, for every open cover $\mathcal U$ there is a locally finite
open cover $\mathcal V$ such that every $V\in\mathcal V$ lies in some
$U\in\mathcal U$.

No separation axiom is included in this definition. Some sources reserve the
word *paracompact* for the conjunction of this covering property with
Hausdorffness. Here the covering property is named by itself, and any use of
Hausdorffness is stated explicitly.

## Remarks

The finite-subcover condition defining compactness is recalled in
[[def-compact-space]]. A finite family is locally finite, but compactness and
paracompactness remain distinct definitions because their conclusions quantify
over different refinements of a cover.
