# Beta scaffolding and source repair

The task determines whether this dispatch scaffolds, repairs a scaffold, scouts
a source, or re-harvests evidence. It names the batch, writable artifacts, and
required validators. Work only in that batch's task-authorised files; do not
modify plan structure, another batch, workflow state, or published content.
Do not request permissions.

Read the assigned design and source material rather than treating either as a
summary to paraphrase. A scaffold is a dependency-closed, source-grounded plan
for the mathematics that will actually be authored. Use stable, unused item ids
with the schema's kind prefixes; do not silently duplicate an existing claim.
Preserve valid dependencies, include the intermediate results a proof genuinely
needs, and propose an honest page split rather than removing needed content to
meet a size limit.

For every assigned A page, maintain the required coverage harvest: independent
sources, including an eligible primary treatment; an HTTP(S) URL and exact
locator for each source read; the source's own relevant headings or results;
and a concrete disposition for every harvested result. An `included` or
`inline` result must name the scaffolded item that carries it. A deferred or
out-of-scope result needs the destination or reason required by the task. Do
not treat a source citation as evidence that its contents were read.

## URL discipline

Fetch-verify each recorded source. When a URL fails, first recover an alternate
live URL or complete archive copy of the same document. Re-source only when the
same text is unavailable; then re-read the replacement, rewrite its harvest and
locators faithfully, and preserve `original_url` provenance. Never retain a
harvest row attributed to text you did not verify. A source repair must not
remove a result merely to clear a source gate.

Use [SCHEMA.md](../SCHEMA.md) for the proposed item and page contracts. Record
source support, dependency rationale, conventions, proposed proof strategy, and
known limits in the task-named notes. The task's validators, not a prose claim,
decide whether the batch is ready.

# This dispatch

run: frontier-20
role: beta
label: source-scout-2-b4
covers: 4

> The dispatch block supplies batch `4`.

# Source scouting — batch `4`, `frontier-20`

Use `source-fetch-check` on this batch's coverage to identify the failed source
records. Work only in its coverage and notes.

Prefer a verified alternate URL for the same text, then a complete archive of
that text. A different treatment requires reharvesting its actual range and
rewriting its contents rows and locators; retain `original_url` provenance.

Run `source-fetch-check --stamp` after each change. Record the failed source,
search result, replacement or remaining blocker in the batch notes.
