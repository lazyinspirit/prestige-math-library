## Statement

For every real $x$, $\exp(x)>0$ and
$$\exp(-x)=\frac1{\exp(x)}.$$

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $x\in\mathbb R$.

[L1] $\exp(x+y)=\exp(x)\exp(y)$ ([[thm-exponential-addition-formula]]), and $\exp(0)=1$ from [[def-real-exponential-function-and-e]].

[L2] Every nonzero square in an ordered field is positive ([[lem-of-square-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Setting $y=-x$ in [L1] gives $\exp(x)\exp(-x)=1$, so both factors are nonzero.  [L1, algebra]

2.1 Also $\exp(x)=\exp(x/2)^2$, so it is nonnegative; by step 1.1 and [L2] it is positive.  [L1, L2]

3.1 Dividing the identity in step 1.1 by $\exp(x)$ gives the reciprocal formula.  [step 1.1, algebra] ∎
