You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as
an independent adversarial proof-refuter. Return evidence only; Audit-Alpha
alone adjudicates and edits.

## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` Statement or counterexample, actively search for a
counterexample to the public claim or a failure in the witness. A false public
claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or materially
inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is nonfatal.

Return no more than 450 words, exactly in this shape:

## Statement

Let $n\ge1$. If there is a real $\delta>0$ such that $f$ is
$n$-times differentiable on the open interval
$N_\delta(a)=(a-\delta,a+\delta)$, then
$$\frac{R_{n,a}f(x)}{(x-a)^n}\longrightarrow0\qquad(x\to a).$$
Equivalently, in the usual little-$o$ shorthand,
$f(x)=T_{n,a}f(x)+o((x-a)^n)$. For $n=0$, the analogous assertion is the
separate continuity condition at $a$: for every $\varepsilon>0$, all
domain points $x$ sufficiently near $a$ satisfy
$|f(x)-f(a)|<\varepsilon$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The stated differentiability on the open neighbourhood $N_\delta(a)$ of [[def-neighbourhood-r]], or the separate continuity hypothesis when $n=0$.

[L1] Taylor polynomials and their matching derivatives are [[def-taylor-polynomial-and-remainder]] and [[lem-taylor-polynomial-derivatives]].

[L2] The derivative quotient is [[def-derivative]], differentiability implies continuity ([[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]]), and continuity at $a$ has the stated quantified condition ([[def-continuity-real]]). The Cauchy quotient lemma is [[lem-cauchy-mean-value-quotient-form]], the shifted-power derivative follows from [[lem-derivative-of-a-power]] and [[thm-chain-rule]], and finite limits are [[def-function-limit]] and obey [[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]].

[L3] For $n\ge1$, the canonical real $\iota(n)$ is positive and hence nonzero ([[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Under the separate $n=0$ hypothesis, the quantified assertion is exactly the definition of continuity at $a$.  [given, L2]

1.2 For $n=1$, the derivative definition gives $$\frac{f(x)-f(a)-f'(a)(x-a)}{x-a} =\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}-f'(a)\longrightarrow0.$$ This is the required base case.  [base, given, L2]

1.3 Assume $n\ge2$ and the assertion through order $n-1$. Put $R=R_{n,a}f$. Then $R(a)=R'(a)=0$, and $R'(x)=R_{n-1,a}(f')(x)$.  [L1, algebra]

2.1 By the induction hypothesis applied to $f'$, $R'(x)/(x-a)^{n-1}\to0$. Applying the Cauchy quotient lemma to $R(x)-R(a)$ and $(x-a)^n$ gives $R(x)/(x-a)^n=R'(\xi)/(\iota(n)(\xi-a)^{n-1})$ for a point $\xi$ between $a$ and $x$.  [step 1.3, ih, L2, L3]

3.1 Since $\xi\to a$, the right side tends to $0$. This proves the Peano estimate without assuming continuity of $f^{(n)}$.  [step 2.1, L2, discharge-induction] ∎

That is legitimate: $c$ is a limit point of the domain\n   $A \\setminus \\{c\\}$ of $q_{f,c}$, so at most one real can satisfy the\n   $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ condition, by [[lem-function-limit-unique]] applied to\n   $q_{f,c}$. Two reals both meeting the condition are therefore equal, and the\n   symbol denotes.\n2. **Meaningfulness.** The hypothesis that $c$ is a limit point of $A$ is not\n   decoration. At an **isolated** point of $A$ the punctured condition\n   $0 < |x - c| < \\delta$ is met by no point of the domain at all, so the\n   $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ formula is satisfied vacuously by *every* real at\n   once; this is why [[def-function-limit]] leaves the limit undefined there,\n   and it is why this library defines $f'(c)$ only at a limit point of $A$. At\n   an isolated point of its domain a function is neither differentiable nor\n   non-differentiable here: the question is not posed.\n\n**The limit sees only $A \\setminus \\{c\\}$, so how the difference quotient is\nextended to $c$ is irrelevant.** Let $Q : A \\to \\mathbb{R}$ agree with\n$q_{f,c}$ at every point of $A \\setminus \\{c\\}$, and let $L \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nThen $\\lim_{x \\to c} Q(x) = L$ if and only if $\\lim_{x \\to c} q_{f,c}(x) = L$.\nBoth conditions read: for every real $\\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real\n$\\delta > 0$ such that every point $x$ of the relevant domain with\n$0 < |x - c| < \\delta$ satisfies $|{\\cdot} - L| < \\varepsilon$\n([[def-function-limit]]). The clause $0 < |x - c|$ removes $x = c$ from both\nquantifiers, so in both cases the points quantified over are exactly the\n$x \\in A \\setminus \\{c\\}$ with $0 < |x - c| < \\delta$, at which $Q$ and\n$q_{f,c}$ take the same value. The two conditions are the same condition.\n\n**Differentiability on a set.** For $S \\subseteq A$, $f$ is **differentiable on\n$S$** when it is differentiable at every $c \\in S$; implicit in that phrase is\nthat every point of $S$ is a limit point of $A$. $f$ is **differentiable** when\nit is differentiable on the whole of $A$.\n\n**Restriction of the domain.** Let $B \\subseteq A$, let $c \\in B$ and suppose\n$c$ is a limit point of $B$. If $f$ is differentiable at $c$, then so is the\nrestriction $f|_B : B \\to \\mathbb{R}$, and\n\n$$(f|_B)'(c) \\;=\\; f'(c) .$$\n\nIndeed $B \\setminus \\{c\\} \\subseteq A \\setminus \\{c\\}$; the displayed identity\nof punctured neighbourhoods above, applied to $B$, shows that $c$ is a limit\npoint of $B \\setminus \\{c\\}$; the difference quotient $q_{f|_B, c}$ is the\nrestriction of $q_{f,c}$ to $B \\setminus \\{c\\}$, since $f|_B(c) = f(c)$; and\nclaim 2 of [[lem-limit-is-local]] carries the limit to that restriction.\n\n**Every point of a nondegenerate interval is a limit point of it.** Let\n$J \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ be order-convex ([[def-interval]]) with at least two\nelements and let $p \\in J$. Choose $q \\in J$ with $q \\ne p$, and let a real\n$\\varepsilon > 0$ be given. If $p < q$, put $y := p + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\min\\{\\varepsilon,\\ q - p\\}$;\nthen $p < y$, and $y - p \\le \\tfrac{1}{2}(q-p) < q - p$, so $p < y < q$ and\norder-convexity gives $y \\in J$, while $0 < |y - p| < \\varepsilon$. If $q < p$,\nthe point $y := p - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\min\\{\\varepsilon,\\ p - q\\}$ serves in the same\nway. So $N^{*}_{\\varepsilon}(p) \\cap J \\ne \\varnothing$ for every real\n$\\varepsilon > 0$, that is, $p$ is a limit point of $J$\n([[def-limit-point-r]]).\n\nConsequently, for $f$ defined on a nondegenerate interval $I$, the symbol\n$f'(c)$ is meaningful at **every** $c \\in I$, endpoints included. At an endpoint\nthe difference quotient is taken over the points of $I$ lying on the one side\nthat is available, so what other texts call a one-sided derivative is, here,\nsimply the derivative of $f$ on $I$.",

The two forms agree because\n$|f(x) - L| < \\varepsilon$ says exactly $f(x) \\in N_\\varepsilon(L)$, and\n$0 < |x - c| < \\delta$ says exactly $x \\in N^{*}_\\delta(c)$.\n\n**Three features of this definition are load bearing, not decoration.**\n\n1. **$c$ is required to be a limit point of $A$.** By [[def-limit-point-r]] that\n   says every punctured neighbourhood of $c$ meets $A$, so for every $\\delta > 0$\n   the set $A \\cap N^{*}_\\delta(c)$ over which the implication quantifies is\n   nonempty. Drop the requirement and the implication can be satisfied\n   vacuously by *every* real $L$ at once, which is exactly what\n   [[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]] records. At a point of $A$\n   that is not a limit point of $A$ — an isolated point — the symbol\n   $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x)$ is therefore **not defined** in this library.\n\n2. **$c \\in A$ is not required.** A limit point of $A$ need not belong to $A$\n   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and the definition never evaluates $f$ at $c$. This\n   is what allows a limit to be taken at a point where the function is not\n   defined at all, as at $0$ for $x \\mapsto x\\,\\psi(1/x)$.\n\n3. **The value $f(c)$, when it exists, is irrelevant.** The hypothesis\n   $0 < |x - c|$ excludes $x = c$ from the quantifier, so changing $f$ at the\n   single point $c$ changes nothing. Equality of the limit with the value is an\n   extra condition, not a consequence: [[fs-limit-equals-value]].\n\n**The notation presumes uniqueness.** Writing $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = L$ treats\nthe left-hand side as a name for a single real number, which is legitimate only\nbecause at a limit point at most one $L$ can satisfy the displayed condition.\nThat obligation is discharged by [[lem-function-limit-unique]], recorded in this\nitem's `justified_by`. As with $\\sup S$ ([[rem-sup-conventions]]) and\n$\\lim_k x_k$ ([[lem-limit-unique]]), the symbol is written only for a function\nalready known to have a limit at $c$.\n\n**Real and rational $\\varepsilon$ define the same relation.** Above,\n$\\varepsilon$ and $\\delta$ range over the positive reals. Restricting either\nquantifier to the positive rationals gives the same relation: every positive\nrational is a positive real, and below every positive real lies a positive\nrational ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), so an $\\varepsilon$-condition verified for\nall positive rationals is verified for an arbitrary positive real $\\eta$ by\nrunning it at a rational $\\varepsilon$ with $0 < \\varepsilon < \\eta$, and a\n$\\delta$ produced as a real may be shrunk to a rational one below it. This is\nthe passage sanctioned in the remarks of [[def-sequence]], and it is what lets\nthis definition be compared with [[def-real-limit]], whose $\\varepsilon$ is\nrational, in [[thm-sequential-criterion-for-function-limits]].",

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$ be a
limit point of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]). If $f$ is differentiable at $c$
([[def-derivative]]) then $f$ is continuous at $c$ ([[def-continuity-real]]).

Consequently, if $f$ is differentiable on a set $S \subseteq A$ then $f$ is
continuous at every point of $S$.

**No converse is asserted, and none holds.** Continuity at $c$ does not give
differentiability at $c$, and the standard witness is worked out on the
companion page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and a point $c \in A$ that is a limit point of $A$ at which $f$ is differentiable ([[def-derivative]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L1] Carathéodory's characterisation ([[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]]): since $f$ is differentiable at the limit point $c$ of $A$, there is $\varphi : A \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $c$, with $f(x) - f(c) = \varphi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in A$, and $\varphi(c) = f'(c)$.

[L2] Algebra of continuous functions ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]]): sums, scalar multiples and products of functions continuous at a point of the common domain are continuous there (claim 1); and every constant function on $A$ and the identity $x \mapsto x$ on $A$ are continuous at every point of $A$ (claim 5).

[L3] Continuity of $f$ at $c$ is the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ condition of [[def-continuity-real]], and continuity on a set is continuity at each of its points.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Fix a function $\varphi : A \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $c$, with $f(x) - f(c) = \varphi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in A$. [L1, choose]

1.2 The identity $x \mapsto x$ on $A$ and every constant function on $A$ are continuous at $c$; hence so is $x \mapsto x - c$, which is the sum of the identity and the constant function with value $-c$. [L2]

2.1 The pointwise product $x \mapsto \varphi(x)(x - c)$ is continuous at $c$, being the product of two functions on $A$ continuous at $c$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L2]

3.1 For every $x \in A$ one has $f(x) = f(c) + \varphi(x)(x - c)$, so $f$ is the sum of the constant function with value $f(c)$ and the product of step 2.1. [step 1.1, L1]

4.1 A sum of two functions continuous at $c$ is continuous at $c$, so $f$ is continuous at $c$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L2, L3]

5.1 The point $c$ was an arbitrary point of $A$, a limit point of $A$, at which $f$ is differentiable; applying step 4.1 at every point of a set $S \subseteq A$ on which $f$ is differentiable gives continuity of $f$ at every point of $S$. [step 3.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the work actually is.** None of it is here. Carathéodory's characterisation already replaces the quotient by a product, and a product is visibly small when one factor is bounded near $c$ and the other tends to $0$; the algebra of continuous functions packages exactly that. A direct proof from the quotient would multiply and divide by $x - c$ and would have to say why that is legal, which is the same observation in a less convenient place.

- **The converse fails.** $x \mapsto |x|$ is continuous at $0$ and not differentiable there, which is [[cex-absolute-value-is-not-differentiable-at-zero]] on the companion page. So continuity is strictly weaker, and the gap is not exotic: it opens at a single corner.

- **What is *not* claimed.** Nothing here says that a function differentiable on a set has a continuous derivative, and nothing here says that $f'$ is defined anywhere except where it was assumed to be. Both are separate questions, and neither is settled on this page.

## Definition

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]) with additive identity $0_F$ and
multiplicative identity $1_F$. Define
$\iota : \mathbb{N} \to F$ by recursion on $\mathbb{N}$
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[thm-recursion]]):

$$\iota(0) \;:=\; 0_F, \qquad \iota(n+1) \;:=\; \iota(n) + 1_F .$$

$\iota(n)$ is the **canonical natural** of $n$ in $F$. It is also written
$n \cdot 1_F$, and for $n \ge 1$ it is $1_F$ added to itself $n$ times.

**Why the notation is needed at all.** A natural number in this library is a von
Neumann natural, that is a set ([[def-natural-numbers]]), and a set is not an
element of $F$. So $1/n$, $n^{\alpha}$ and $x/n$ are not expressions of $F$ when
$n$ is a natural: what they mean is $1/\iota(n)$, $\iota(n)^{\alpha}$ and
$x/\iota(n)$. The map $\iota$ is what carries a counting number into the field,
and writing it is the whole reason a reader meets $1/\iota(k+1)$ where an
informal text would write $1/(k+1)$.

## Remarks

- **Where the index shift comes from.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
  ([[def-natural-numbers]]) and $\iota(0) = 0_F$, so $1/\iota(k)$ is undefined at
  $k = 0$. A family of reciprocals indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ is therefore written
  over $\iota(k+1)$, which is why the harmonic and telescoping families of this
  library run over $k+1$ rather than over $k$. This is bookkeeping, not a
  restriction: the values are the usual ones.

- **This definition records notation; the arithmetic is proved elsewhere.** That
  $\iota$ is strictly increasing and positive on $n \ge 1$, and that it carries
  sums to sums and products to products, is [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], stated
  for an ordered field. That lemma introduces the same element by the equivalent
  recursion $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, which
  agrees with the definition above because $\iota(1) = \iota(0) + 1_F = 1_F$.
  Nothing here is new mathematics; the definition exists so that the notation has
  a home a reader can look up.

- **The symbol $\iota$ is used in this library for other canonical maps, and this
  definition does not govern them.** It also denotes the canonical field
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to F$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), the isometric
  embedding of a metric space into a completion ([[def-metric-completion]]), and
  an inclusion map $\iota : S \to X$ of a subspace. Each of those is introduced
  where it is used and means something different from the map defined here. What
  the four share is only that each is the canonical map of its situation.

- **Fields, not just ordered fields.** The recursion needs no order, so the
  definition is stated for a field; every use in this library is in an ordered
  field, and the order is what makes $\iota$ injective
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). In a field of positive characteristic $\iota$
  is not injective, which is one reason the injectivity is a lemma rather than
  part of the definition.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field with its order and
absolute value ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]), and
neighbourhoods are those of [[def-neighbourhood-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Then
$f$ is **continuous at $c$** when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

with $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ ranging over the **positive reals**. In the
language of neighbourhoods: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ with

$$f\bigl(A \cap N_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \;\subseteq\; N_{\varepsilon}\bigl(f(c)\bigr).$$

$f$ is **continuous on $A$** when it is continuous at every point of $A$.

**The point $c$ is required to lie in $A$, and the condition is unpunctured.**
Both differ from [[def-function-limit]], and deliberately. There the quantifier
runs over $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, which removes $x = c$; here $x = c$ is allowed,
and at $x = c$ the implication reads $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$, which is
automatic. So allowing $x = c$ costs nothing, and it is what lets the definition
be stated at every point of $A$, including the points where no limit exists.

**Three clauses, and all three are part of the definition.**

1. **At a limit point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is a limit point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]). Then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if the
   limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) \;=\; f(c)$$
   ([[def-function-limit]]). Indeed, for a given $\varepsilon > 0$ a $\delta$
   witnessing continuity witnesses the limit condition, because the limit
   condition quantifies over a subset of the points continuity quantifies over;
   and conversely a $\delta$ witnessing $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$ witnesses
   continuity, because the one point it omits, $x = c$, satisfies
   $|f(c) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ anyway.

2. **At an isolated point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is an isolated point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so that $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ for some real
   $\eta > 0$. Then **every** $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$: take
   $\delta := \eta$, so that the only $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ is $c$
   itself, and $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$.

3. **On a set.** Continuity on $A$ is continuity at each point of $A$, and
   nothing more. It is not a condition relating $f$ to points outside $A$.

Every point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$,
and never both ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so clauses 1 and 2 between them describe
continuity at every point of $A$.

**This is not the raw $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula of
[[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]].** That item records what goes
wrong when the *punctured* formula of [[def-function-limit]] is written down at
an arbitrary point of the domain: at an isolated point it is satisfied
vacuously by every real $L$ at once, so it defines nothing, and this library
therefore leaves $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ **undefined** at an isolated point.
Continuity at an isolated point is a different matter: the formula above is not
vacuous — it is a genuine condition on $f(c)$, satisfied because $f(c)$ is the
only value being compared with itself — and it names a single, well-defined
property. The limit is undefined there; the continuity is defined, and is
automatic. Clause 1 is the only place where the two notions meet, and it is
stated only where the limit exists as a notion.

**Where the distinction disappears.** If $A$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), then every $c \in A$ has some
$N_{\eta}(c) \subseteq A$, and a punctured neighbourhood is never empty
([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), so every point of $A$ is a limit point of $A$ and
clause 1 covers the whole of $A$. The same holds when $A$ is a nondegenerate
interval ([[def-interval]]). Isolated points are what force clause 2 to exist at
all, and they occur as soon as $A$ is allowed to be an arbitrary subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, as in $A = \{0\} \cup [1,2]$.

## Remarks

- **Continuity is local.** If $\eta > 0$ and $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agrees with
  $f$ on $A \cap N_{\eta}(c)$, then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if $g$
  is: any $\delta$ may be replaced by $\min\{\delta, \eta\}$, after which the
  condition only ever evaluates the two functions where they agree. So
  continuity at $c$ sees only an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of $c$, exactly
  as the limit does ([[lem-limit-is-local]]).

- **Continuity passes to subsets of the domain.** If $B \subseteq A$ and
  $c \in B$, then continuity of $f$ at $c$ gives continuity of the restriction
  $f|_B$ at $c$, with the same $\delta$: the condition on $f|_B$ quantifies over
  fewer points. The converse fails, and the standard witness is the indicator of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ restricted to $\mathbb{Q}$, which is constant and hence
  continuous, while the indicator itself is continuous nowhere
  ([[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]]).

- **The radius is a real number.** As in [[def-neighbourhood-r]], $\varepsilon$
  and $\delta$ range over the positive reals here. Restricting either quantifier
  to the positive rationals defines the same relation, by the passage recorded
  in [[def-function-limit]]: below every positive real lies a positive rational
  ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and a real $\delta$ may be shrunk to a rational
  one below it.

- **The word *continuous* is used for two things in this library, and they
  agree.** [[def-metric-continuity]] defines continuity of a map between metric
  spaces, and $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ carries the metric $d(x,y) = |x-y|$. The
  two notions coincide, and that is proved, not assumed:
  [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]] is the dictionary, and it is stated on
  this page precisely so that no later item has to guess.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), neighbourhoods are those of
[[def-neighbourhood-r]] and limit points those of [[def-limit-point-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$ be a
**limit point of $A$**. The **difference quotient of $f$ at $c$** is the function

$$q_{f,c} : A \setminus \{c\} \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad q_{f,c}(x) := \frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c} .$$

The division is legitimate at every point of the domain, since $x \ne c$ gives
$x - c \ne 0$.

**The point $c$ is a limit point of $A \setminus \{c\}$, not merely of $A$.**
For every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the punctured neighbourhood
$N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c)$ omits $c$, so

$$N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c) \cap A \;=\; N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c) \cap (A \setminus \{c\}) ,$$

and the left-hand side is nonempty because $c$ is a limit point of $A$. So
$q_{f,c}$ is a function on a set having $c$ as a limit point, and
$\lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x)$ is a notion that [[def-function-limit]] defines.

$f$ is **differentiable at $c$** when that limit exists, and then the
**derivative of $f$ at $c$** is

$$f'(c) \;:=\; \lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x) \;=\; \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c} .$$

**Two obligations are carried by that notation, and both are discharged here.**

1. **Uniqueness.** Writing $f'(c)$ treats the right-hand side as a name for a
   single real number. That is legitimate: $c$ is a limit point of the domain
   $A \setminus \{c\}$ of $q_{f,c}$, so at most one real can satisfy the
   $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ condition, by [[lem-function-limit-unique]] applied to
   $q_{f,c}$. Two reals both meeting the condition are therefore equal, and the
   symbol denotes.
2. **Meaningfulness.** The hypothesis that $c$ is a limit point of $A$ is not
   decoration. At an **isolated** point of $A$ the punctured condition
   $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ is met by no point of the domain at all, so the
   $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula is satisfied vacuously by *every* real at
   once; this is why [[def-function-limit]] leaves the limit undefined there,
   and it is why this library defines $f'(c)$ only at a limit point of $A$. At
   an isolated point of its domain a function is neither differentiable nor
   non-differentiable here: the question is not posed.

**The limit sees only $A \setminus \{c\}$, so how the difference quotient is
extended to $c$ is irrelevant.** Let $Q : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agree with
$q_{f,c}$ at every point of $A \setminus \{c\}$, and let $L \in \mathbb{R}$.
Then $\lim_{x \to c} Q(x) = L$ if and only if $\lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x) = L$.
Both conditions read: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ such that every point $x$ of the relevant domain with
$0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|{\cdot} - L| < \varepsilon$
([[def-function-limit]]). The clause $0 < |x - c|$ removes $x = c$ from both
quantifiers, so in both cases the points quantified over are exactly the
$x \in A \setminus \{c\}$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, at which $Q$ and
$q_{f,c}$ take the same value. The two conditions are the same condition.

**Differentiability on a set.** For $S \subseteq A$, $f$ is **differentiable on
$S$** when it is differentiable at every $c \in S$; implicit in that phrase is
that every point of $S$ is a limit point of $A$. $f$ is **differentiable** when
it is differentiable on the whole of $A$.

**Restriction of the domain.** Let $B \subseteq A$, let $c \in B$ and suppose
$c$ is a limit point of $B$. If $f$ is differentiable at $c$, then so is the
restriction $f|_B : B \to \mathbb{R}$, and

$$(f|_B)'(c) \;=\; f'(c) .$$

Indeed $B \setminus \{c\} \subseteq A \setminus \{c\}$; the displayed identity
of punctured neighbourhoods above, applied to $B$, shows that $c$ is a limit
point of $B \setminus \{c\}$; the difference quotient $q_{f|_B, c}$ is the
restriction of $q_{f,c}$ to $B \setminus \{c\}$, since $f|_B(c) = f(c)$; and
claim 2 of [[lem-limit-is-local]] carries the limit to that restriction.

**Every point of a nondegenerate interval is a limit point of it.** Let
$J \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be order-convex ([[def-interval]]) with at least two
elements and let $p \in J$. Choose $q \in J$ with $q \ne p$, and let a real
$\varepsilon > 0$ be given. If $p < q$, put $y := p + \tfrac{1}{2}\min\{\varepsilon,\ q - p\}$;
then $p < y$, and $y - p \le \tfrac{1}{2}(q-p) < q - p$, so $p < y < q$ and
order-convexity gives $y \in J$, while $0 < |y - p| < \varepsilon$. If $q < p$,
the point $y := p - \tfrac{1}{2}\min\{\varepsilon,\ p - q\}$ serves in the same
way. So $N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(p) \cap J \ne \varnothing$ for every real
$\varepsilon > 0$, that is, $p$ is a limit point of $J$
([[def-limit-point-r]]).

Consequently, for $f$ defined on a nondegenerate interval $I$, the symbol
$f'(c)$ is meaningful at **every** $c \in I$, endpoints included. At an endpoint
the difference quotient is taken over the points of $I$ lying on the one side
that is available, so what other texts call a one-sided derivative is, here,
simply the derivative of $f$ on $I$.

## Remarks

- **Notation.** $f'(c)$ and $\frac{df}{dx}(c)$ denote the same real number, and
  this library uses the first. Neither is an operation performed on a symbol
  $x$: the variable in the second is a name for the argument and nothing more.

- **Differentiability is a property of the pair $(f, A)$ at $c$, not of $f$
  alone.** The restriction clause above goes in one direction only, and the
  converse fails. Take $A := \mathbb{R}$, $f(x) := |x|$, $B := [0,\infty)$ and
  $c := 0$. Then $f|_B$ is the identity on $B$, whose difference quotient at $0$
  is constantly $1$, so $f|_B$ is differentiable at $0$ with derivative $1$;
  that $f$ itself is not differentiable at $0$ is
  [[cex-absolute-value-is-not-differentiable-at-zero]] on the companion page.
  So enlarging the domain can destroy differentiability, and the phrase
  "$f$ is differentiable at $c$" always carries the domain with it.

- **The relation to continuity is not definitional.** [[def-continuity-real]]
  is a condition on $f$ near $c$ that does not mention a quotient, and it is
  defined at every point of $A$, isolated points included, whereas
  differentiability is defined only at limit points of $A$. That
  differentiability implies continuity is a theorem on this page and not a
  reading of the definitions.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) with its order and absolute value
([[def-real-order]]).

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$, let $c \in \mathbb{R}$
be a **limit point** of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and let $L \in \mathbb{R}$.
We say that **$f(x)$ tends to $L$ as $x$ tends to $c$**, and write

$$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L ,$$

when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ 0 < |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - L| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

where $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ range over the **positive reals**.

In the language of neighbourhoods ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]) the condition reads:
for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ with

$$f\bigl(A \cap N^{*}_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \;\subseteq\; N_{\varepsilon}(L),$$

$N^{*}_{\delta}(c) = \{\, y : 0 < |y - c| < \delta \,\}$ being the punctured
$\delta$-neighbourhood of $c$ and $N_{\varepsilon}(L) = (L - \varepsilon,\ L +
\varepsilon)$ the open interval of [[def-interval]]. The two forms agree because
$|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ says exactly $f(x) \in N_\varepsilon(L)$, and
$0 < |x - c| < \delta$ says exactly $x \in N^{*}_\delta(c)$.

**Three features of this definition are load bearing, not decoration.**

1. **$c$ is required to be a limit point of $A$.** By [[def-limit-point-r]] that
   says every punctured neighbourhood of $c$ meets $A$, so for every $\delta > 0$
   the set $A \cap N^{*}_\delta(c)$ over which the implication quantifies is
   nonempty. Drop the requirement and the implication can be satisfied
   vacuously by *every* real $L$ at once, which is exactly what
   [[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]] records. At a point of $A$
   that is not a limit point of $A$ — an isolated point — the symbol
   $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ is therefore **not defined** in this library.

2. **$c \in A$ is not required.** A limit point of $A$ need not belong to $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and the definition never evaluates $f$ at $c$. This
   is what allows a limit to be taken at a point where the function is not
   defined at all, as at $0$ for $x \mapsto x\,\psi(1/x)$.

3. **The value $f(c)$, when it exists, is irrelevant.** The hypothesis
   $0 < |x - c|$ excludes $x = c$ from the quantifier, so changing $f$ at the
   single point $c$ changes nothing. Equality of the limit with the value is an
   extra condition, not a consequence: [[fs-limit-equals-value]].

**The notation presumes uniqueness.** Writing $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$ treats
the left-hand side as a name for a single real number, which is legitimate only
because at a limit point at most one $L$ can satisfy the displayed condition.
That obligation is discharged by [[lem-function-limit-unique]], recorded in this
item's `justified_by`. As with $\sup S$ ([[rem-sup-conventions]]) and
$\lim_k x_k$ ([[lem-limit-unique]]), the symbol is written only for a function
already known to have a limit at $c$.

**Real and rational $\varepsilon$ define the same relation.** Above,
$\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ range over the positive reals. Restricting either
quantifier to the positive rationals gives the same relation: every positive
rational is a positive real, and below every positive real lies a positive
rational ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), so an $\varepsilon$-condition verified for
all positive rationals is verified for an arbitrary positive real $\eta$ by
running it at a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, and a
$\delta$ produced as a real may be shrunk to a rational one below it. This is
the passage sanctioned in the remarks of [[def-sequence]], and it is what lets
this definition be compared with [[def-real-limit]], whose $\varepsilon$ is
rational, in [[thm-sequential-criterion-for-function-limits]].

## Remarks

- **Terminology.** *Limit point* here is a property of the set $A$ and the point
  $c$, in the sense of [[def-limit-point-r]]; it has nothing to do with
  subsequential limits ([[def-subsequential-limit]]), and the distinction is the
  one that item records.

- **Why the punctured condition, and not $|x - c| < \delta$.** With the
  unpunctured condition the definition would force $f$ to be defined at $c$ and
  would force $|f(c) - L| < \varepsilon$ for every $\varepsilon$, that is,
  $L = f(c)$. The resulting notion is continuity at $c$, a strictly stronger
  condition, and conflating the two is the error catalogued in
  [[fs-limit-equals-value]].

- **One-sided and infinite variants.** Restricting the domain to one side of $c$
  gives the one-sided limits of [[def-one-sided-limits]]; replacing the
  conditions on $x$ or on $f(x)$ by unboundedness conditions gives the limits at
  and to infinity of [[def-limits-at-infinity]]. Both are built on this
  definition rather than beside it.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]) and its absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]).

Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ with
$\varepsilon > 0$. The **$\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\},$$

and the **punctured $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \;=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}.$$

The two descriptions of $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ agree because $|y - x| = 0$ holds
exactly when $y = x$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**A neighbourhood is an open interval.** For every $x$ and every
$\varepsilon > 0$,

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;=\; (x - \varepsilon,\ x + \varepsilon),$$

the interval of [[def-interval]]. Indeed [[lem-of-abs-value]] gives, for
$\varepsilon > 0$, the equivalence $|y - x| < \varepsilon \iff -\varepsilon <
y - x < \varepsilon$, and adding $x$ throughout turns the right-hand side into
$x - \varepsilon < y < x + \varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**The centre lies in its own neighbourhoods.** $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, since
$|x - x| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**Punctured neighbourhoods are never empty.** The element
$y := x + \varepsilon/2$ satisfies $|y - x| = \varepsilon/2$, which is
$> 0$ and $< \varepsilon$, so $y \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$
([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

**Monotonicity in the radius.** If $0 < \delta \le \varepsilon$ then
$N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, because $|y - x| < \delta \le
\varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**Nesting at an interior point.** If $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and
$0 < \delta \le \varepsilon - |y - x|$, then

$$N_\delta(y) \;\subseteq\; N_\varepsilon(x).$$

Indeed for $z \in N_\delta(y)$ the triangle inequality
([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]) gives
$|z - x| = |(z - y) + (y - x)| \le |z - y| + |y - x| < \delta + |y - x| \le
\varepsilon$. Note that $\varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ precisely because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, so such a $\delta$ always exists.

## Remarks

- **The radius is a real number, not a rational.** Nothing on this page tests a
  condition against rational radii only. That convention belongs to
  [[def-real-limit]], where the quantifier is over rational $\varepsilon$ and
  the passage between the rational and the real form is the sanctioned remark of
  [[def-sequence]]. Here $\varepsilon$ ranges over the positive reals
  throughout, and every statement above is proved for an arbitrary positive
  real.

- **Why the punctured version is separated out.** A limit point of a set is a
  point every punctured neighbourhood of which meets the set
  ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and deleting the centre is exactly what stops a point
  of the set from qualifying automatically. The unpunctured condition defines
  the weaker notion of an adherent point, and the difference between the two is
  precisely an isolated point.

- **Nesting is the workhorse.** Almost every openness verification on this page
  has the shape "given $y$ in the set, shrink the radius by the distance
  already travelled", which is the nesting property above. It is recorded here
  once so that no later proof has to redo the triangle inequality in passing.

## Definition

Let $n\in\mathbb N$, let $f$ have derivatives through order $n$ at $a$, and let $\iota:\mathbb N\to\mathbb R$ be the canonical embedding. The **Taylor polynomial of degree at most $n$ about $a$** is
$$T_{n,a}f(x):=\sum_{j=0}^{n}\frac{f^{(j)}(a)}{\iota(j!)}(x-a)^j.$$
The **Taylor remainder** is $R_{n,a}f(x):=f(x)-T_{n,a}f(x)$.

The factorials are natural numbers as in [[def-factorial-and-falling-factorial]] and enter real arithmetic only through $\iota$ ([[def-canonical-natural]]); they are nonzero ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). The sum and powers are those of [[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], and [[def-integer-power]]. For $n=0$, $T_{0,a}f$ is the constant $f(a)$.

## Statement

Let $a<b$. If $f,g$ are continuous on $[a,b]$, differentiable on $(a,b)$, and $g'(x)\ne0$ throughout $(a,b)$, then $g(b)\ne g(a)$ and there is $c\in(a,b)$ such that
$$\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)}=\frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)}.$$

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The functions and hypotheses in the statement.

[L1] Cauchy's mean value theorem gives $(f(b)-f(a))g'(c)=(g(b)-g(a))f'(c)$ for some $c\in(a,b)$ ([[thm-cauchy-mean-value]]).

[L2] Rolle's theorem says equal endpoint values force an interior zero of the derivative ([[thm-rolle]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 If $g(a)=g(b)$, Rolle gives $d\in(a,b)$ with $g'(d)=0$, contrary to the hypothesis. Hence $g(b)-g(a)\ne0$.  [L2, given]

1.2 Cauchy's theorem supplies $c\in(a,b)$ with the cross-product identity in [L1].  [L1]

2.1 Divide that identity by the two nonzero factors $g(b)-g(a)$ and $g'(c)$ to obtain the quotient formula.  [step 1.1, step 1.2, algebra] ∎

## Statement

Powers are those of [[def-integer-power]], and $\iota : \mathbb{N} \to
\mathbb{R}$ is the canonical natural of [[def-canonical-natural]], so that
$\iota(0) = 0$ and $\iota(m+1) = \iota(m) + 1$. Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

1. The function $p_0 : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, $p_0(x) = x^{0}$, is the
   constant function $1$, and it is differentiable at every $c \in \mathbb{R}$
   with $p_0'(c) = 0$ ([[def-derivative]]).
2. For $n \ge 1$ the function $p_n : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$,
   $p_n(x) = x^{n}$, is differentiable at every $c \in \mathbb{R}$, and
   $$p_n'(c) \;=\; \iota(n)\,c^{\,n-1} .$$
3. For $n \ge 1$ put $A_0 := \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \ne 0 \,\}$. The function
   $m_n : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$, $m_n(x) = x^{-n}$, is differentiable at every
   $c \in A_0$ as a function on $A_0$, and
   $$m_n'(c) \;=\; -\,\iota(n)\,c^{\,-n-1} .$$
4. Let $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with $a_j = 0$ for $j \ge n$, and let
   $P : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be the polynomial function
   $P(x) = \sum_{j<n} a_j x^{j}$ ([[def-finite-sum]]). Then $P$ is
   differentiable at every $c \in \mathbb{R}$, and, defining $e : \mathbb{N}
   \to \mathbb{R}$ by $e_0 := 0$ and $e_j := \iota(j)\,a_j\,c^{\,j-1}$ for
   $j \ge 1$,
   $$P'(c) \;=\; \sum_{j<n} e_j .$$

**Claim 2 is stated for $n \ge 1$ and not for $n \ge 0$, and that is not
timidity.** At $n = 0$ its right-hand side reads $\iota(0)\,c^{-1}$, and
$c^{-1}$ is not defined at $c = 0$ ([[def-integer-power]]), so the formula is
not a statement about the whole line. Claim 1 is what covers $n = 0$, and it
says the derivative is $0$ there, which is what the informal reading
"$0 \cdot c^{-1}$" is reaching for. The same shift is why the term $e_0$ of
claim 4 is defined to be $0$ outright rather than by the formula.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural $n$, a real $c$, and the functions $p_n$, $m_n$ and $P$ of the statement.

[L1] Powers ([[def-integer-power]]): $a^{0} = 1$ and $a^{m+1} = a^{m}a$ for every $a \in \mathbb{R}$ and $m \in \mathbb{N}$; $a^{-m} := (a^{m})^{-1}$ for $a \ne 0$ and $m \ge 1$; and $0^{m} = 0$ for $m \ge 1$.

[L2] Canonical naturals ([[def-canonical-natural]]): $\iota(0) = 0$, $\iota(m+1) = \iota(m) + 1$, and hence $\iota(1) = 1$.

[L3] Algebra of derivatives ([[thm-algebra-of-derivatives]]): at a limit point $c$ of the common domain, sums, scalar multiples and products of functions differentiable at $c$ are differentiable at $c$ with the four stated formulas, and if the denominator is nonzero at $c$ then the quotient, restricted to the set where the denominator does not vanish, is differentiable at $c$ with the quotient formula; that restricted set has $c$ as a limit point.

[L4] Derivative and difference quotient ([[def-derivative]]): $f$ is differentiable at a limit point $c$ of its domain $D$ exactly when the difference quotient $x \mapsto (f(x)-f(c))/(x-c)$, a function on $D \setminus \{c\}$, has a limit at $c$, and $f'(c)$ is that limit. A constant function $h \equiv K$ on a set having $c$ as a limit point has $\lim_{x \to c} h(x) = K$: given a real $\varepsilon > 0$, any real $\delta > 0$ serves, since $|K - K| = 0 < \varepsilon$ ([[def-function-limit]]).

[L5] Induction principle on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L6] Finite sums ([[def-finite-sum]]): $\sum_{j<0} b_j = 0$ and $\sum_{j<m+1} b_j = \bigl(\sum_{j<m} b_j\bigr) + b_m$.

[L7] Integer exponent laws for a nonzero base ([[lem-power-laws]]): $a^{k} \ne 0$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ when $a \ne 0$; and for integers $j, k$ one has $a^{j}a^{k} = a^{j+k}$, $(a^{j})^{k} = a^{jk}$ and $a^{-k} = (a^{k})^{-1}$.

[L8] Every real is a limit point of $\mathbb{R}$, punctured neighbourhoods in $\mathbb{R}$ being never empty ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 **Base case, claim 2 at $n = 1$.** By [L1], $x^{1} = x^{0}x = 1 \cdot x = x$, so $p_1$ is the identity. Fix $c \in \mathbb{R}$; for every $x \ne c$ the difference quotient is $(x - c)/(x - c) = 1$, so it is the constant function $1$ on $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{c\}$, and by [L4] and [L8] its limit at $c$ is $1$. Since $\iota(1)c^{0} = 1 \cdot 1 = 1$ by [L1] and [L2], claim 2 holds at $n = 1$. [base, L1, L2, L4, L8]

1.2 **Inductive hypothesis.** Fix a natural $n \ge 1$ and assume that $p_n$ is differentiable at every $c \in \mathbb{R}$ with $p_n'(c) = \iota(n)c^{\,n-1}$. [ih]

1.3 **Claim 1.** By [L1] the function $p_0$ is the constant function $1$. Fix $c \in \mathbb{R}$; for every $x \ne c$ its difference quotient is $(1-1)/(x-c) = 0$, the constant function $0$ on $\mathbb{R}\setminus\{c\}$, whose limit at $c$ is $0$ by [L4] and [L8]. So $p_0$ is differentiable at every $c$ with $p_0'(c) = 0$. [L1, L4, L8]

2.1 **Successor step.** Let $c \in \mathbb{R}$. By [L1], $p_{n+1}(x) = x^{n+1} = x^{n}x = p_n(x)\,p_1(x)$ for every $x$. Both factors are differentiable at $c$, by step 1.2 and step 1.1, so the product rule of [L3] gives that $p_{n+1}$ is differentiable at $c$ with $p_{n+1}'(c) = p_n'(c)p_1(c) + p_n(c)p_1'(c) = \iota(n)c^{\,n-1}c + c^{n} \cdot 1$. Now $c^{\,n-1}c = c^{\,(n-1)+1} = c^{n}$ by [L1], so the right-hand side is $\iota(n)c^{n} + c^{n} = \bigl(\iota(n)+1\bigr)c^{n} = \iota(n+1)c^{n}$ by [L2]. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1, L2, L3]

3.1 **Claim 2.** Steps 1.1 and 2.1 are the base case and the successor step of an induction over the naturals $n \ge 1$, so by [L5] the function $p_n$ is differentiable at every $c \in \mathbb{R}$ with $p_n'(c) = \iota(n)c^{\,n-1}$, for every natural $n \ge 1$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L5]

4.1 **Claim 3.** Let $n \ge 1$. The set $\{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : p_n(x) \ne 0 \,\}$ is exactly $A_0$: a nonzero $x$ has $x^{n} \ne 0$ by [L7], and $0^{n} = 0$ by [L1]. Fix $c \in A_0$. The constant function $1$ on $\mathbb{R}$ is differentiable at $c$ with derivative $0$ by step 1.3, and $p_n$ is differentiable at $c$ with derivative $\iota(n)c^{\,n-1}$ by step 3.1, with $p_n(c) = c^{n} \ne 0$. So the quotient rule of [L3] applies: the function $x \mapsto 1/x^{n}$ on $A_0$, which by [L1] and [L7] is $m_n$, is differentiable at $c$ with derivative $\bigl(0 \cdot c^{n} - 1 \cdot \iota(n)c^{\,n-1}\bigr)/(c^{n})^{2} = -\iota(n)\,c^{\,n-1}\bigl(c^{\,2n}\bigr)^{-1} = -\iota(n)\,c^{\,n-1-2n} = -\iota(n)\,c^{\,-n-1}$, where $(c^{n})^{2} = c^{\,2n}$ and $c^{\,n-1}c^{\,-2n} = c^{\,-n-1}$ are [L7]. [step 1.3, step 3.1, L1, L3, L7]

4.2 **Claim 4, by a second induction on $n$.** Fix $c \in \mathbb{R}$ and the sequence $a$. At $n = 0$ the sum $P(x) = \sum_{j<0} a_j x^{j}$ is $0$ for every $x$ by [L6], so $P$ is the constant function $0$ and, as in step 1.3, $P'(c) = 0 = \sum_{j<0} e_j$. Suppose the claim holds at $n$, and let $P_{n+1}(x) := \sum_{j<n+1} a_j x^{j}$. By [L6], $P_{n+1}(x) = P_n(x) + a_n x^{n}$ for every $x$, where $P_n(x) = \sum_{j<n} a_j x^{j}$. The function $x \mapsto a_n x^{n}$ is differentiable at $c$ with derivative $e_n$: for $n = 0$ it is the constant $a_n$, of derivative $0 = e_0$, by step 1.3 and the scalar rule of [L3]; for $n \ge 1$ it is the scalar multiple $a_n p_n$, of derivative $a_n \iota(n)c^{\,n-1} = e_n$, by step 3.1 and the scalar rule of [L3]. The inductive hypothesis gives $P_n'(c) = \sum_{j<n} e_j$, so the sum rule of [L3] gives that $P_{n+1}$ is differentiable at $c$ with $P_{n+1}'(c) = \sum_{j<n} e_j + e_n = \sum_{j<n+1} e_j$ by [L6]. By [L5] claim 4 holds for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 1.3, step 3.1, L3, L5, L6]

5.1 All four claims are established: claim 1 by step 1.3, claim 2 by step 3.1, claim 3 by step 4.1 and claim 4 by step 4.2. [step 1.3, step 3.1, step 4.1, step 4.2, discharge-induction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the induction starts at $n = 1$ and not at $n = 0$.** The successor step multiplies by the identity, and the identity is $p_1$; starting at $n = 0$ would require the formula of claim 2 to hold at $n = 0$, which it does not, since $c^{-1}$ is undefined at $c = 0$. The two statements are therefore kept apart, and claim 1 is proved on its own from the definition. This is the same index care that [[def-canonical-natural]] records for families of reciprocals: $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$, and a formula written for "$n$" is a claim about $n = 0$ unless it says otherwise.

- **The negative exponents cost nothing extra.** Claim 3 is the quotient rule of [[thm-algebra-of-derivatives]] applied with numerator the constant $1$, and the domain it produces, the set where $x^{n}$ does not vanish, is exactly $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$; no separate argument and no separate limit is needed. Rational exponents are a different matter, resting on [[thm-nth-roots-exist]], and are treated on the companion page rather than here.

- **Claim 4 is a statement about a finite sum, not about an infinite one.** Nothing here says anything about differentiating a series term by term; that is a separate question, needing hypotheses about convergence that this page does not have and does not assume.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field, with field structure as in [[def-field]], and for
$n \ge 1$ let $n \cdot 1_F$ denote the canonical natural number
$\underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$, defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$
and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$. Then for every $n \ge 1$:

- $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$;
- the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$;
- $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ and $(mn) \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F)$ for all $m, n \ge 1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ whose canonical naturals are defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, with $0 \cdot 1_F = 0$.

[L1] $0 < 1_F$ in every ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] The order is compatible with addition and positives are closed under addition: $a < b$ implies $a + c < b + c$, and $a > 0$, $b > 0$ imply $a + b > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 1$: by definition $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, and $1_F > 0$. [L1, base]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: assume $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for some fixed $n \ge 1$. [ih]

1.3 By the recursion, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F - n \cdot 1_F = 1_F > 0$, so $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$. [given, L1]

1.4 Additive identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ by the recursion, and if $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ then $(m+n+1) \cdot 1_F = (m+n) \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + (n+1) \cdot 1_F$. [given, algebra]

2.1 Inductive step: $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ is a sum of two positives, by the hypothesis and $1_F > 0$, hence $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Iterating 1.3, for $m < n$ one has $m \cdot 1_F < n \cdot 1_F$, so $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing and therefore injective on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$. [step 1.3, L2]

2.3 Multiplicative identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m \cdot 1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(1 \cdot 1_F)$, and the step $(m(n+1)) \cdot 1_F = (mn + m) \cdot 1_F = (mn) \cdot 1_F + m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F) + (m \cdot 1_F)(1_F) = (m \cdot 1_F)((n+1) \cdot 1_F)$ uses 1.4 and distributivity. [step 1.4, algebra]

3.1 By induction on 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for every $n \ge 1$; with the strict increase 2.2 and the identities 1.4, 2.3, every claim holds. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 1.4, step 2.3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

For $0\le r\le n$,
$$(T_{n,a}f)^{(r)}(x)=\sum_{j=r}^{n}\frac{f^{(j)}(a)}{\iota((j-r)!)}(x-a)^{j-r}.$$
Consequently $(T_{n,a}f)^{(r)}(a)=f^{(r)}(a)$, and $R_{n,a}f$ and its derivatives through order $n$ vanish at $a$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The Taylor polynomial of [[def-taylor-polynomial-and-remainder]].

[L1] Natural powers differentiate as in [[lem-derivative-of-a-power]]; applying the chain rule to $x\mapsto x-a$, whose derivative is $1$, gives the same shifted-power formula; and finite sums differentiate termwise by [[thm-chain-rule]] and [[thm-algebra-of-derivatives]].

[L2] Falling factorials cancel factorials according to [[def-factorial-and-falling-factorial]]; finite sums reindex by [[lem-finite-sum-laws]].

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 At $r=0$ the formula is the definition.  [base, given]

1.2 Assuming the formula at $r<n$, differentiate termwise. The term indexed $j$ acquires $\iota(j-r)$, which cancels $\iota((j-r)!)$ to $\iota((j-r-1)!)$; the $j=r$ constant term disappears. This is the formula at $r+1$.  [ih, L1, L2, algebra]

2.1 At $x=a$, only the $j=r$ term survives and equals $f^{(r)}(a)$. Subtraction from $f^{(r)}(a)$ gives the remainder assertion.  [step 1.2, L1, algebra]

3.1 The formula and both consequences hold through order $n$.  [step 1.1, step 2.1, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $c$ be a limit point of $A$
([[def-limit-point-r]]), let $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $\alpha \in
\mathbb{R}$. Suppose the limits of $f$ and of $g$ at $c$ exist, and write
$L := \lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ and $M := \lim_{x \to c} g(x)$
([[def-function-limit]]). Then:

1. the limit of $f + g$ at $c$ exists, and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} (f + g)(x) \;=\; \lim_{x \to c} f(x) + \lim_{x \to c} g(x) \;=\; L + M ;$$
2. the limit of $\alpha f$ at $c$ exists, and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} (\alpha f)(x) \;=\; \alpha \lim_{x \to c} f(x) \;=\; \alpha L ;$$
3. the limit of $fg$ at $c$ exists, and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} (fg)(x) \;=\; \Bigl(\lim_{x \to c} f(x)\Bigr)\Bigl(\lim_{x \to c} g(x)\Bigr) \;=\; LM ;$$
4. if $M \ne 0$, then, writing $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$, the point
   $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$, the quotient $f/g$ is defined on $A_0$ by
   $(f/g)(x) = f(x) / g(x)$, the limit of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$ exists, and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} (f/g)|_{A_0}(x) \;=\; \frac{\lim_{x \to c} f(x)}{\lim_{x \to c} g(x)} \;=\; \frac{L}{M} .$$

Each equation asserts two things at once: that the limit on the left exists, and
that it has the stated value. Both are proved. The symbols denote by
[[lem-function-limit-unique]].

**Everything below is proved directly from $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$.** No
sequence is constructed and no choice principle is used, so all four claims are
theorems of ZF. Passing through
[[thm-sequential-criterion-for-function-limits]] instead would import the
countable choice spent in that theorem's converse direction, for no gain; see
[[rem-heine-criterion-choice-cost]].

**Why the quotient is stated on $A_0$.** The function $f/g$ is simply not defined
where $g$ vanishes, and $g$ may well vanish at points of $A$ arbitrarily far from
$c$; restricting to $A_0$ is therefore forced. That this restriction still has
$c$ as a limit point, so that the limit there means anything at all, is the last
claim of [[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]]. The sequential analogue
[[thm-algebra-of-limits]] needs the corresponding hypothesis in the form "the
denominator sequence is nonzero at every index".

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a limit point $c$ of $A$, functions $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\alpha$, and reals $L, M$ with $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$ and $\lim_{x \to c} g(x) = M$; for claim 4 also $M \ne 0$ and $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$ ([[def-function-limit]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L1] The limit condition: $\lim_{x \to c} h(x) = P$ means that for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x$ in the domain of $h$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|h(x) - P| < \varepsilon$ ([[def-function-limit]]).

[L2] Absolute value: $|u| \ge 0$; $|u| = 0$ if and only if $u = 0$; $|uv| = |u|\,|v|$; and $|{-u}| = |u|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L3] Triangle inequality: $|u + v| \le |u| + |v|$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L4] Order and field arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: adding two strict inequalities ([[lem-of-add-order]]); for $t > 0$, $u < v$ is equivalent to $ut < vt$, and $0 \le u \le v$ with $0 \le s \le t$ gives $us \le vt$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]); positive elements have positive inverses and $0 < a < b$ gives $0 < 1/b < 1/a$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]); $0 < 1$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]), so $2 > 0$ and $t/2 > 0$ for $t > 0$; inverses and the field identities ([[def-field]]); trichotomy and totality, so of finitely many positive reals the smallest is positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] Local boundedness: there are a real $\delta_0 > 0$ and a real $K \ge 0$ with $|f(x)| \le K$ for every $x \in A$ satisfying $0 < |x - c| < \delta_0$ ([[lem-limit-implies-local-boundedness]]).

[L6] Sign preservation: if $M \ne 0$ there is a real $\delta_s > 0$ with $|g(x)| > |M|/2 > 0$ for every $x \in A$ satisfying $0 < |x - c| < \delta_s$, and $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$ ([[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]]).

[L7] Restriction: if $B \subseteq A$ has $c$ as a limit point and $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$, then $\lim_{x \to c} f|_B(x) = L$ (claim 2 of [[lem-limit-is-local]]).

[L8] Neighbourhoods ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Sum.** Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real. By [L1] fix reals $\delta_1, \delta_2 > 0$ with $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon/2$ for every $x \in A$ satisfying $0 < |x - c| < \delta_1$ and $|g(x) - M| < \varepsilon/2$ for every $x \in A$ satisfying $0 < |x - c| < \delta_2$, and let $\delta$ be the smaller of the two, so $\delta > 0$. For $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ we get $|(f+g)(x) - (L+M)| = |(f(x) - L) + (g(x) - M)| \le |f(x) - L| + |g(x) - M| < \varepsilon$. As $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary, the limit of $f + g$ at $c$ exists and equals $L + M$: claim 1. [L1, L2, L3, L4, choose]

1.2 **Scalar multiple.** If $\alpha = 0$ then $\alpha f$ is the constant function $0$ and $\alpha L = 0$, so $|(\alpha f)(x) - \alpha L| = 0 < \varepsilon$ for every $x$ and every $\varepsilon > 0$, any $\delta$ serving. If $\alpha \ne 0$ then $|\alpha| > 0$; given a real $\varepsilon > 0$, [L1] supplies $\delta > 0$ with $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon/|\alpha|$ on $A \cap N^{*}_{\delta}(c)$, and there $|(\alpha f)(x) - \alpha L| = |\alpha|\,|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$. So the limit of $\alpha f$ at $c$ exists and equals $\alpha L$: claim 2. [L1, L2, L4, L8, choose]

1.3 **A working bound for $f$ near $c$.** By [L5] fix a real $\delta_0 > 0$ and a real $K \ge 0$ with $|f(x)| \le K$ for every $x \in A$ satisfying $0 < |x - c| < \delta_0$, and put $K' := K + 1$, so $K' > 0$ and $|f(x)| \le K'$ for all those $x$. [L4, L5, choose]

1.4 **The denominator near $c$.** Assume $M \ne 0$. By [L6] fix a real $\delta_s > 0$ with $|g(x)| > |M|/2 > 0$ for every $x \in A$ satisfying $0 < |x - c| < \delta_s$; every such $x$ has $g(x) \ne 0$, hence lies in $A_0$, and $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$. [L2, L4, L6]

2.1 **Product.** Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real. By [L1] fix reals $\delta_1, \delta_2 > 0$ with $|g(x) - M| < \varepsilon/(2K')$ on $A \cap N^{*}_{\delta_1}(c)$ and $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon / \bigl(2(|M| + 1)\bigr)$ on $A \cap N^{*}_{\delta_2}(c)$, and let $\delta$ be the smallest of $\delta_0, \delta_1, \delta_2$, which is positive. For $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, $|f(x)g(x) - LM| = |f(x)(g(x) - M) + M(f(x) - L)| \le |f(x)|\,|g(x) - M| + |M|\,|f(x) - L| \le K'\,|g(x) - M| + (|M|+1)\,|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$. As $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary, the limit of $fg$ at $c$ exists and equals $LM$: claim 3. [step 1.3, L1, L2, L3, L4, L8, choose]

2.2 **Reciprocal.** Assume $M \ne 0$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real. By [L1] fix a real $\delta_3 > 0$ with $|g(x) - M| < \varepsilon |M|^2 / 2$ on $A \cap N^{*}_{\delta_3}(c)$, and let $\delta$ be the smaller of $\delta_s$ and $\delta_3$. For $x \in A_0$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ we have $|g(x)| > |M|/2 > 0$, hence $|g(x)|\,|M| > |M|^2/2 > 0$ and so $1/(|g(x)|\,|M|) < 2/|M|^2$; therefore $\bigl| 1/g(x) - 1/M \bigr| = |M - g(x)| \big/ \bigl(|g(x)|\,|M|\bigr) < (\varepsilon |M|^2/2)\cdot(2/|M|^2) = \varepsilon$. As $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary, the limit of $(1/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$ exists and equals $1/M$. [step 1.4, L1, L2, L4, L8, choose]

2.3 **The numerator on the smaller domain.** Assume $M \ne 0$. Since $A_0 \subseteq A$ and $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$ by step 1.4, [L7] gives that the limit of $f|_{A_0}$ at $c$ exists and equals $L$. [step 1.4, L7]

3.1 **Quotient.** Assume $M \ne 0$. On the domain $A_0$, which has $c$ as a limit point, the two functions $f|_{A_0}$ and $(1/g)|_{A_0}$ have limits $L$ and $1/M$ at $c$ by steps 2.3 and 2.2, and their product is $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ by the field identities; so claim 3, applied on the domain $A_0$, gives that the limit of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$ exists and equals $L \cdot (1/M) = L/M$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, L2, L4]

4.1 Claims 1 to 4 are proved, each directly from the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ definition and none of them through a sequence. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.1, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The product estimate in one line.** The identity $fg - LM = f\,(g - M) + M\,(f - L)$ turns the problem into two products, one with a factor that is merely bounded near $c$ (that is $f$, and [[lem-limit-implies-local-boundedness]] is what bounds it) and one with a constant factor. The two constants $K'$ and $|M| + 1$ are used in place of $K$ and $|M|$ only so that they are strictly positive and may be divided by; that is the sole reason for adding $1$.

- **The reciprocal estimate in one line.** The identity $1/g - 1/M = (M - g)/(gM)$ turns the problem into a numerator that is small and a denominator that must be kept away from $0$; the lower bound $|g| > |M|/2$ from [[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]] does exactly that, and gives the working factor $2/|M|^2$.

- **Nothing here extends to $\pm\infty$.** The statement is about a finite limit point $c$ and finite values $L, M$; [[def-limits-at-infinity]] introduces limits at and to infinity, but no algebra of such limits is proved in this library, and none may be assumed. The companion page's limit at $+\infty$ is computed by a direct estimate for precisely that reason.

- **The sequential analogue** is [[thm-algebra-of-limits]]. Neither implies the other for free: this theorem is about a function on a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ and is proved from $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$; that one is about sequences.

## Statement

Let $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ with
$g[A] \subseteq B$ and let $f : B \to \mathbb{R}$, so that the composite
$f \circ g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is defined. Let $c \in A$ be a limit point of
$A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]) at which $g$ is differentiable
([[def-derivative]]), put $b := g(c)$, and suppose $b$ is a limit point of $B$
at which $f$ is differentiable. Then $f \circ g$ is differentiable at $c$ and

$$(f \circ g)'(c) \;=\; f'\bigl(g(c)\bigr)\,g'(c) .$$

**Both limit-point hypotheses are needed, and neither is automatic.** That $c$
is a limit point of $A$ is what makes $g'(c)$ and $(f \circ g)'(c)$ defined
symbols; that $b = g(c)$ is a limit point of $B$ is what makes $f'(b)$ one.
Nothing forces the second: $g$ may be differentiable at $c$ and send $c$ to an
isolated point of $B$, and there $f'(b)$ is not defined and the formula asserts
nothing.

**No case analysis appears anywhere.** The naive difference-quotient proof
writes $\frac{f(g(x)) - f(g(c))}{g(x) - g(c)} \cdot \frac{g(x) - g(c)}{x - c}$
and then has to say what happens where $g(x) = g(c)$, which may occur at points
arbitrarily close to $c$. Carathéodory's factorisation never divides by the
inner increment, so the difficulty does not arise.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sets $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, functions $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ with $g[A] \subseteq B$ and $f : B \to \mathbb{R}$, a point $c \in A$ that is a limit point of $A$ at which $g$ is differentiable, and the point $b := g(c) \in B$, a limit point of $B$ at which $f$ is differentiable ([[def-derivative]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L1] Carathéodory's characterisation ([[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]]), used in both directions: for $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a point $p \in D$ that is a limit point of $D$ and $h : D \to \mathbb{R}$, the function $h$ is differentiable at $p$ if and only if there is $\eta : D \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $p$, with $h(y) - h(p) = \eta(y)(y - p)$ for every $y \in D$, and then $\eta(p) = h'(p)$.

[L2] Algebra of continuous functions ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], claim 1): a product of two functions continuous at a point of their common domain is continuous there.

[L3] Composition of continuous functions ([[thm-composition-of-continuous-functions]]): if $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ has $g[A] \subseteq B$ and is continuous at $c \in A$, and if $\eta : B \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $g(c)$, then $\eta \circ g$ is continuous at $c$ ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L4] A function differentiable at a point is continuous there ([[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L1], applied to $g$ on $A$ at $c$, fix $\psi : A \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $c$, with $g(x) - g(c) = \psi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in A$ and $\psi(c) = g'(c)$. [L1, choose]

1.2 By [L1], applied to $f$ on $B$ at $b$, fix $\varphi : B \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $b$, with $f(y) - f(b) = \varphi(y)(y - b)$ for every $y \in B$ and $\varphi(b) = f'(b)$. [L1, choose]

2.1 **The factorisation.** Let $x \in A$. Then $g(x) \in B$, so taking $y := g(x)$ in step 1.2 gives $f(g(x)) - f(b) = \varphi(g(x))\bigl(g(x) - b\bigr)$, and $g(x) - b = g(x) - g(c) = \psi(x)(x-c)$ by step 1.1. Since $(f \circ g)(c) = f(g(c)) = f(b)$, this reads $(f \circ g)(x) - (f \circ g)(c) = \chi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in A$, where $\chi : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is the pointwise product $\chi := (\varphi \circ g)\,\psi$. [step 1.1, step 1.2]

2.2 **The outer factor is continuous at $c$.** By [L4] the function $g$ is continuous at $c$; by step 1.2 the function $\varphi$ is continuous at $b = g(c)$; and $g[A] \subseteq B$. So $\varphi \circ g$ is continuous at $c$ by [L3]. [step 1.2, L3, L4]

3.1 **The factor is continuous at $c$, with the right value.** $\chi$ is the product of $\varphi \circ g$, continuous at $c$ by step 2.2, with $\psi$, continuous at $c$ by step 1.1, so $\chi$ is continuous at $c$ by [L2]; and $\chi(c) = \varphi(g(c))\,\psi(c) = \varphi(b)\,\psi(c) = f'(b)\,g'(c)$. [step 1.1, step 2.2, L2]

4.1 By step 2.1 the function $\chi : A \to \mathbb{R}$ factors the increment of $f \circ g$ at $c$, and by step 3.1 it is continuous at $c$. So [L1], applied to $f \circ g$ on $A$ at the limit point $c$, gives that $f \circ g$ is differentiable at $c$ with $(f \circ g)'(c) = \chi(c) = f'(g(c))\,g'(c)$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the classical proof goes wrong, precisely.** It divides by $g(x) - g(c)$, which may vanish at points arbitrarily close to $c$ even when $g$ is differentiable at $c$ with $g'(c) = 0$; the usual repair defines an auxiliary function equal to the outer quotient off the bad set and to $f'(b)$ on it, and then proves that auxiliary function continuous. That auxiliary function is $\varphi \circ g$, and [[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]] is the observation that it exists before any repair is attempted.

- **What is composed is continuity, not differentiability.** The only theorem about composites used above is [[thm-composition-of-continuous-functions]], and it needs no side hypothesis, unlike the corresponding statement for limits. That is the whole reason the proof has no cases.

- **The formula is about the point $g(c)$, not about $g$ near $c$.** Both derivatives on the right are taken at single points, and the theorem says nothing about $f$ on the image of any neighbourhood of $c$. In particular no hypothesis is placed on $g[A]$ beyond its lying in $B$.

## Statement

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. If $0 \in S$ and $\sigma(n) \in S$ whenever $n \in S$, then $S = \mathbb{N}$. Equivalently (property form): if a property $P$ satisfies $P(0)$ and ($P(n) \Rightarrow P(\sigma(n))$) for all $n$, then $P(n)$ holds for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. This is the induction principle, the basis of proof by induction.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $\mathbb{N} = \omega$ is the smallest inductive set ([[def-inductive-set]], [[def-natural-numbers]], [[lem-omega-smallest-inductive]]); $0 = \varnothing$, $\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$.

[L1] $\omega$ is contained in every inductive set ([[lem-omega-smallest-inductive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Suppose $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ with $0 = \varnothing \in S$ and ($x \in S \Rightarrow \sigma(x) = x \cup \{x\} \in S$). [given]

2.1 Then $S$ contains $\varnothing$ and is closed under $x \mapsto x \cup \{x\}$, so $S$ is an inductive set. [step 1.1]

3.1 $\mathbb{N} = \omega \subseteq S$ because $\omega$ is a subset of every inductive set. [L1, step 2.1]

4.1 With $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ by hypothesis, $S = \mathbb{N}$. [step 3.1, given]

5.1 The property form is the set case with $S = \{n \in \mathbb{N} : P(n)\}$: $P(0)$ and $P(n) \Rightarrow P(\sigma(n))$ give $0 \in S$ and $\sigma$-closure, so $S = \mathbb{N}$, i.e. $P$ holds for all $n$; conversely the set form is the property form applied to $P(n) :\equiv n \in S$, so the two are equivalent. [step 4.1] ∎
