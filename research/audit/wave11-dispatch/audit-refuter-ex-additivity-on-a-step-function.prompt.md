## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` Statement or counterexample, actively search for a
counterexample to the public claim or a failure in the witness. A false public
claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or materially
inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is nonfatal.

Return no more than 450 words, exactly in this shape:

## Example

Let $f : [0,2] \to \mathbb{R}$ be

$$f(x) \;:=\; \begin{cases} 1 & 0 \le x < 1, \\ 3 & 1 \le x \le 2. \end{cases}$$

Then $f$ is integrable on $[0,2]$ and

$$\int_0^2 f \;=\; 1 + 3 \;=\; 4 .$$

Two routes are carried out below. The first splits at the jump with
[[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]] and evaluates each piece with
[[lem-changing-a-function-at-finitely-many-points]] and the constant case of
[[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]]. The second computes lower and upper Darboux
sums directly on a three-point partition and squeezes.

**Why this is the smallest interesting example.** The jump sits at the interior
point $1$, which is a partition point of both routes, and a partition point lies
in **two** subintervals ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]). That is exactly the
case singled out in the proof of
[[lem-changing-a-function-at-finitely-many-points]], and it is why the value of
$f$ at the single point $1$ is irrelevant to both the integrability and the value
while the *upper* sums still see it.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The function $f$ above on $[0,2]$, and a real $\eta$ with $0 < \eta < 1$.

[L1] A monotone function on a closed bounded interval with distinct endpoints is bounded and integrable there ([[thm-monotone-implies-integrable]], [[def-monotone-function]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L2] For $0 < c < 2$: $f$ is integrable on $[0,2]$ if and only if it is integrable on $[0,c]$ and on $[c,2]$, and then $\int_0^2 f = \int_0^c f + \int_c^2 f$ ([[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]], [[def-oriented-integral]]).

[L3] Changing an integrable function at finitely many points changes neither its integrability nor its integral ([[lem-changing-a-function-at-finitely-many-points]]).

[L4] $\int_p^q c = c(q-p)$ for a constant $c$, and the five-term chain $L(u,P) \le \underline{\int} u \le \overline{\int} u \le U(u,P)$ holds for every partition ([[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L5] For a partition $P = (n,t)$ and bounded $u$: $L(u,P) = \sum_{i<n}m_i\Delta_i$ and $U(u,P) = \sum_{i<n}M_i\Delta_i$ with $m_i = \inf u[I_i]$, $M_i = \sup u[I_i]$, and a set with a least element has it as its infimum ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[def-infimum]], [[def-max-min]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L6] Ordered-field arithmetic: the order is total and transitive, and a real that is $\le 4 + 2\eta$ for every $\eta$ in $(0,1)$ is $\le 4$ ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-interval]]).

## Verification

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $f$ is nondecreasing on $[0,2]$: for $x \le y$ the only possibility not giving $f(x) = f(y)$ is $x < 1 \le y$, where $f(x) = 1 < 3 = f(y)$. Hence $f$ is bounded and integrable on $[0,2]$, and likewise on $[0,1]$ and on $[1,2]$, by [L1]. [given, L1]

1.2 **Second route.** Let $P_{\eta}$ be the partition of $[0,2]$ with point set $\{0,\ 1-\eta,\ 1,\ 2\}$, so $n = 3$ with $\Delta_0 = 1-\eta$, $\Delta_1 = \eta$ and $\Delta_2 = 1$. [given, L5, construct]

2.1 **First route, the piece $[0,1]$.** The constant function $1$ on $[0,1]$ agrees with $f$ at every point of $[0,1]$ except $x = 1$, a single point; so by [L3] and [L4], $\int_0^1 f = \int_0^1 1 = 1\cdot(1-0) = 1$. [step 1.1, L3, L4]

2.2 **The piece $[1,2]$.** There $f$ is the constant $3$, so $\int_1^2 f = 3\cdot(2-1) = 3$ by [L4]. [step 1.1, L4]

2.3 On $I_0 = [0,1-\eta]$, $f$ is constantly $1$, so $m_0 = M_0 = 1$. On $I_1 = [1-\eta,1]$, $f$ takes the value $1$ at every point below $1$ and $3$ at $1$, so $m_1 = 1$ and $M_1 = 3$ by [L5]. On $I_2 = [1,2]$, $f$ is constantly $3$, so $m_2 = M_2 = 3$. [step 1.2, given, L5]

3.1 By [L2] with $c := 1$, $\int_0^2 f = \int_0^1 f + \int_1^2 f = 1 + 3 = 4$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, L2]

3.2 Hence $L(f,P_{\eta}) = 1(1-\eta) + 1\cdot\eta + 3\cdot 1 = 4$ and $U(f,P_{\eta}) = 1(1-\eta) + 3\eta + 3\cdot1 = 4 + 2\eta$, by [L5]. [step 2.3, L5]

4.1 By [L4] the number $\int_0^2 f$ lies between $L(f,P_\eta) = 4$ and $U(f,P_\eta) = 4+2\eta$ for every $\eta \in (0,1)$, so $4 \le \int_0^2 f \le 4$ by [L6]; the second route agrees with step 3.1. [step 1.1, step 3.1, step 3.2, L4, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- **The two sums of $P_{\eta}$ are not symmetric, and that is a statement about these partitions.** For each $\eta \in (0,1)$ the lower sum $L(f,P_{\eta})$ is exactly $4$ while the upper sum is $4 + 2\eta > 4$, so this family already locates the integral exactly from below while its upper sums only approach it. Nothing is claimed here about an arbitrary partition: a partition whose points do not include $1$ has a subinterval on which $f$ takes both values, and its lower sum is then strictly below $4$.

- **The value at the jump is irrelevant to the integral, but not to the sums.** Replacing $f(1) = 3$ by any real leaves $f$ integrable with the same integral, by [[lem-changing-a-function-at-finitely-many-points]]. What it changes is which partitions realise the extremes: with $f(1) := 1$ the subinterval $[1-\eta,1]$ carries $m_1 = M_1 = 1$, while $[1,2]$ now carries $m_2 = 1$ and $M_2 = 3$, so $L(f,P_{\eta}) = 2$ and $U(f,P_{\eta}) = 4$ and the asymmetry moves to the other side. The integral is $4$ either way.

- **Additivity is what makes the first route short.** Without [[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]] the only route is the second one, which needs the Darboux sums of a function that is not constant on any partition containing the jump in the interior of a subinterval.

So strictly monotone implies\nmonotone.\n\n**A strictly monotone function is injective**\n([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]). Let $f$ be increasing and let\n$x, y \\in A$ with $x \\ne y$. By trichotomy either $x < y$, and then\n$f(x) < f(y)$, or $y < x$, and then $f(y) < f(x)$; in both cases\n$f(x) \\ne f(y)$. The decreasing case is the same argument. The converse fails,\nand the failure is not exotic: a continuous injection on an interval *is*\nstrictly monotone ([[thm-continuous-injection-on-an-interval-is-strictly-monotone]]),\nbut on a domain that is not an interval it need not be.\n\n**Negation exchanges the two directions.** For $g := -f$, that is\n$g(x) := -f(x)$, the four conditions above are exchanged in pairs: $f$ is\nnondecreasing exactly when $g$ is nonincreasing, and $f$ is increasing exactly\nwhen $g$ is decreasing, because $u \\le v$ holds exactly when $-v \\le -u$\n([[def-ordered-field]]). Several proofs below use this to reduce a nonincreasing\ncase to a nondecreasing one.\n\n**Monotone on a set, not at a point.** All six conditions are conditions on the\nwhole of $A$; unlike continuity ([[def-continuity-real]]) there is no pointwise\nversion, and none is used in this library. The domain $A$ is an arbitrary subset\nof $\\mathbb{R}$; where a result needs $A$ to be an interval\n([[def-interval]]) it says so, and the hypothesis is never decoration.\n\n### The dictionary to monotone sequences\n\nA sequence of reals is a function $x : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{R}$\n([[def-sequence]]), and [[def-monotone-sequence]] calls it nondecreasing when\n$x_j \\le x_k$ for all $j \\le k$, increasing when $x_j < x_k$ for all $j < k$,\nand so on. Those are **the same four conditions as above**, read with the\nordered set $\\mathbb{N}$ in place of the ordered subset $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$\nand with the comparison of indices in place of the comparison of arguments. So\nnothing new is introduced here for sequences, and the two vocabularies may be\nused interchangeably: the words *nondecreasing*, *increasing*, *nonincreasing*,\n*decreasing*, *monotone* and *strictly monotone* mean the corresponding\ncondition on the domain at hand.\n\nOne consequence is used repeatedly, and it has to be stated carefully because\ncomposition does **not** simply preserve the four words. Let $(x_k)$ be a\n**nondecreasing** sequence with $x_k \\in A$ for every $k$, so that $j \\le k$ gives\n$x_j \\le x_k$. Then:\n\n- if $f$ is nondecreasing, $(f(x_k))$ is nondecreasing, since $f(x_j) \\le f(x_k)$;\n- if $f$ is nonincreasing, $(f(x_k))$ is **nonincreasing**, since\n  $f(x_j) \\ge f(x_k)$.\n\nSo along a nondecreasing sequence the composite inherits the direction of $f$;\nand with $(x_k)$ increasing and $f$ increasing, $(f(x_k))$ is increasing, while\nwith $(x_k)$ increasing and $f$ decreasing, $(f(x_k))$ is decreasing.\n\n**Along a nonincreasing sequence the direction is reversed, not inherited.** If\n$(x_k)$ is nonincreasing and $f$ is nonincreasing, then $j \\le k$ gives\n$x_j \\ge x_k$ and hence $f(x_j) \\le f(x_k)$: the composite is **nondecreasing**.\nThe witness is $f(x) = -x$ on $A = \\mathbb{R}$ with $x_k = -k$, where both $f$ and\n$(x_k)$ are decreasing and $f(x_k) = k$ is increasing.

Its\nsubinterval lengths are all equal to $(b-a)/\\iota(N)$, so\n\n$$\\|U_N\\| \\;=\\; \\frac{b-a}{\\iota(N)} .$$\n\n### A partition is determined by its point set\n\n**Claim.** If $P = (n,t)$ and $P' = (n', t')$ are partitions of $[a,b]$ with\n$\\operatorname{pts}(P) = \\operatorname{pts}(P')$, then $n = n'$ and $t_i = t'_i$\nfor every $i \\le n$.\n\n*Proof.* First, $t_i = t'_i$ for every $i \\le \\min\\{n,n'\\}$, by induction on $i$\n([[thm-induction-principle]]). For $i = 0$ both equal $a$. Suppose $t_j = t'_j$\nfor all $j \\le i$ and $i + 1 \\le \\min\\{n,n'\\}$. The set\n$S := \\{\\, x \\in \\operatorname{pts}(P) : x > t_i \\,\\}$ has $t_{i+1}$ as its least\nelement: $t_{i+1} \\in S$, and any $x \\in S$ is $t_j$ for some $j \\le n$ with\n$t_j > t_i$, which forces $j > i$ because $t$ is increasing on indices $\\le n$,\nhence $j \\ge i+1$ and $x = t_j \\ge t_{i+1}$. The same argument in $P'$ makes\n$t'_{i+1}$ the least element of\n$\\{\\, x \\in \\operatorname{pts}(P') : x > t'_i \\,\\}$, which is the same set $S$,\nsince the point sets agree and $t'_i = t_i$. A set has at most one least element\n([[def-max-min]]), so $t_{i+1} = t'_{i+1}$.\n\nSecond, $n = n'$. If $n < n'$ then $t'_n = t_n = b$ by the previous paragraph,\nwhile $t'_n < t'_{n'} = b$ because $t'$ is increasing on indices $\\le n'$ and\n$n < n'$; that is impossible. Exchanging the roles of $P$ and $P'$ rules out\n$n' < n$. $\\square$\n\nSo the map $P \\mapsto \\operatorname{pts}(P)$ is injective, and a partition may be\nnamed by its point set whenever one is exhibited.\n\n### Inserting a point\n\nLet $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ and let $c \\in [a,b]$. Define a\npartition $P + c$ of $[a,b]$ as follows.\n\n- If $c \\in \\operatorname{pts}(P)$, put $P + c := P$.\n- Otherwise $c \\ne a$ and $c \\ne b$, so $a < c < b$. The set\n  $T := \\{\\, t_i : i \\le n \\text{ and } t_i < c \\,\\}$ is a nonempty finite set of\n  reals, nonempty because $t_0 = a < c$, so it has a maximum\n  ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]); let $i_0 \\le n$ be the unique index with\n  $t_{i_0} = \\max T$, unique because $t$ is injective on indices $\\le n$. Then\n  $i_0 < n$, since $t_n = b > c$ puts $t_n \\notin T$; and\n  $$t_{i_0} \\;<\\; c \\;<\\; t_{i_0+1},$$\n  the right inequality because $t_{i_0+1} \\ne c$ (as $c \\notin \\operatorname{pts}(P)$)\n  and $t_{i_0+1} < c$ would put $t_{i_0+1} \\in T$ with $t_{i_0+1} > t_{i_0} = \\max T$.\n  Put $P + c := (n+1, s)$ with\n  $$s_i := t_i \\ (i \\le i_0), \\qquad s_{i_0+1} := c, \\qquad s_i := t_{i-1} \\ (i_0 + 2 \\le i \\le n+1), \\qquad s_k := b \\ (k \\ge n+1).$$\n\nIn both cases $P + c$ is a partition of $[a,b]$ and\n\n$$\\operatorname{pts}(P + c) \\;=\\; \\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\{c\\}, \\qquad \\|P+c\\| \\;\\le\\; \\|P\\| .$$\n\nThe displayed identity is immediate from the two cases. For the mesh: in the\nfirst case nothing changes; in the second the list of subinterval lengths of\n$P + c$ is that of $P$ with $\\Delta_{i_0}$ replaced by the two numbers\n$c - t_{i_0}$ and $t_{i_0+1} - c$, each of which is smaller than\n$\\Delta_{i_0} = (c - t_{i_0}) + (t_{i_0+1} - c)$ because the other is positive.\nSo every length of $P + c$ is at most a length of $P$, and the maximum cannot\nincrease. Finally the index count grows by exactly $1$ in the second case and\nnot at all in the first.\n\n### Refinement and the common refinement\n\n$P'$ **refines** $P$, and is a **refinement** of $P$, when\n\n$$\\operatorname{pts}(P) \\;\\subseteq\\; \\operatorname{pts}(P') .$$\n\nLet $P = (n,t)$ and $Q = (m,s)$ be partitions of $[a,b]$. Applying the recursion\ntheorem ([[thm-recursion]]) to the set $\\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$,\nwhere $\\mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$ is the set of partitions of $[a,b]$, with starting\nelement $(0, P)$ and the map $(j, R) \\mapsto (j+1,\\ R + s_j)$ — legitimate\nbecause $s_j \\in [a,b]$ for every $j \\in \\mathbb{N}$ — gives a unique family\n$(R_j)_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ of partitions with $R_0 = P$ and $R_{j+1} = R_j + s_j$.\nThe **common refinement** of $P$ and $Q$ is\n\n$$P \\vee Q \\;:=\\; R_{m+1} .$$\n\n**Its point set is the union.** By induction on $j$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]),\n$\\operatorname{pts}(R_j) = \\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\{\\, s_l : l < j \\,\\}$;\ntaking $j = m+1$ gives\n\n$$\\operatorname{pts}(P \\vee Q) \\;=\\; \\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\operatorname{pts}(Q).$$\n\nHence $P \\vee Q$ refines both $P$ and $Q$; by the uniqueness claim above it is\nthe **only** partition with that point set, so $P \\vee Q = Q \\vee P$, and\n\n$$P' \\text{ refines } P \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad P \\vee P' = P' ,$$\n\nsince then $\\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\operatorname{pts}(P') =\n\\operatorname{pts}(P')$.\n\n**Two size bounds, both used later.** Writing $n_R$ for the first component of a\npartition $R$:\n\n$$\\|P \\vee Q\\| \\;\\le\\; \\|P\\|, \\qquad n_{P \\vee Q} \\;\\le\\; n_P + n_Q - 1 .$$\n\nThe first is the mesh bound above applied $m+1$ times. For the second, each\ninsertion raises the index count by at most $1$, and the two insertions of\n$s_0 = a$ and $s_m = b$ raise it by $0$, since $a$ and $b$ already lie in\n$\\operatorname{pts}(P)$ and hence in $\\operatorname{pts}(R_j)$ for every $j$; so\nat most $m - 1$ of the $m+1$ insertions increase it.\n\n### The index map of a refinement\n\nLet $P' = (n',t')$ refine $P = (n,t)$. For each $i \\le n$ the point $t_i$ lies in\n$\\operatorname{pts}(P')$, so there is exactly one $\\varphi(i) \\le n'$ with\n$t'_{\\varphi(i)} = t_i$, uniqueness because $t'$ is injective on indices $\\le n'$.\nThe resulting map $\\varphi$ satisfies\n\n$$\\varphi(0) = 0, \\qquad \\varphi(n) = n', \\qquad \\varphi(i) < \\varphi(i+1) \\ \\ (i < n),$$\n\nthe first two because $t'_0 = a = t_0$ and $t'_{n'} = b = t_n$ together with\ninjectivity, and the third because $t_i < t_{i+1}$ and $t'$ is increasing on\nindices $\\le n'$. In particular $n \\le n'$. Moreover, for $i < n$ and\n$\\varphi(i) \\le j < \\varphi(i+1)$,\n\n$$I'_j \\;=\\; [\\,t'_j,\\ t'_{j+1}\\,] \\;\\subseteq\\; [\\,t_i,\\ t_{i+1}\\,] \\;=\\; I_i ,$$\n\nbecause $t_i = t'_{\\varphi(i)} \\le t'_j$ and $t'_{j+1} \\le t'_{\\varphi(i+1)} = t_{i+1}$.\n\n**The blocks are counted by telescoping.** By clause 5 of\n[[lem-finite-sum-laws]],\n$\\sum_{i<n}\\big(\\varphi(i+1) - \\varphi(i)\\big) = \\varphi(n) - \\varphi(0) = n'$,\nso, subtracting $\\sum_{i<n} 1 = n$,\n\n$$\\sum_{i<n} \\big(\\varphi(i+1) - \\varphi(i) - 1\\big) \\;=\\; n' - n ,$$\n\na sum of $n$ nonnegative integers, one for each block, which vanishes exactly at\nthe blocks consisting of a single index. This identity is the whole content of\nthe quantitative bound in [[lem-refinement-inequalities]], and it is also why\n$n \\le n'$.\n\nFinally, the lengths inside a block sum to the length of the block:\n\n$$\\sum_{j = \\varphi(i)}^{\\varphi(i+1)-1} \\Delta'_j \\;=\\; t'_{\\varphi(i+1)} - t'_{\\varphi(i)} \\;=\\; t_{i+1} - t_i \\;=\\; \\Delta_i \\qquad (i < n),$$\n\nagain by telescoping, applied to the sequence $l \\mapsto t'_{\\varphi(i)+l}$ and\nread through the index-shift convention of [[def-finite-sum]].",

## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq F$.

- $u \in F$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$; $S$ is
  **bounded above** if it has an upper bound.
- $u \in F$ is a **least upper bound** (or **supremum**, $\sup S$) of $S$ if $u$
  is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le u'$ for every upper bound $u'$ of $S$.

$F$ is a **complete ordered field** (equivalently, $F$ has the
**least-upper-bound property**, or is **Dedekind complete**) if every nonempty
$S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$.

## Remarks

- A least upper bound, if it exists, is unique (two least upper bounds are each
  $\le$ the other, so equal by antisymmetry of the order).
- Applying the property to $\{-s : s \in S\}$ yields the dual **greatest lower
  bound** (infimum) property, so the two are equivalent.
- The Dedekind-cut reals have this property by construction
  ([[thm-dedekind-complete]]); the Cauchy-sequence reals acquire it via
  [[cor-cauchy-reals-lub-complete]]. This definition is the target for the
  uniqueness theorem [[thm-uniqueness-complete-ordered-field]].

## Definition

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]). Write $\mathcal{P}$ for the set of all partitions of
$[a,b]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]) and put

$$\mathcal{L} \;:=\; \{\, L(f,P) \ : \ P \in \mathcal{P} \,\}, \qquad \mathcal{U} \;:=\; \{\, U(f,P) \ : \ P \in \mathcal{P} \,\}$$

for the sets of lower and of upper Darboux sums ([[def-darboux-sums]]).

### Both extrema exist

**$\mathcal{P}$ is nonempty**: the pair $(1, t)$ with $t_0 := a$ and $t_k := b$
for $k \ge 1$ is a partition of $[a,b]$, since $a < b$. So $\mathcal{L}$ and
$\mathcal{U}$ are nonempty.

**$\mathcal{L}$ is bounded above and $\mathcal{U}$ is bounded below.** Fix any
$Q \in \mathcal{P}$. By claim 2 of [[lem-refinement-inequalities]],
$L(f,P) \le U(f,Q)$ for every $P \in \mathcal{P}$, so $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound
of $\mathcal{L}$; and $L(f,Q) \le U(f,P)$ for every $P$, so $L(f,Q)$ is a lower
bound of $\mathcal{U}$.

Hence a nonempty set bounded above has a supremum
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and a nonempty set bounded below has an infimum
([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]), each unique ([[lem-sup-unique]]).
The **lower** and **upper Darboux integrals** of $f$ over $[a,b]$ are the real
numbers

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;:=\; \sup \mathcal{L} \;=\; \sup_{P} L(f,P), \qquad \overline{\int_a^b} f \;:=\; \inf \mathcal{U} \;=\; \inf_{P} U(f,P) .$$

### The lower integral never exceeds the upper one

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f .$$

Indeed, for each fixed $Q \in \mathcal{P}$ the number $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound
of $\mathcal{L}$, so the least upper bound satisfies
$\underline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,Q)$. As $Q$ was arbitrary, $\underline{\int_a^b}f$
is a lower bound of $\mathcal{U}$, and the greatest lower bound satisfies
$\underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f$ ([[def-infimum]]).

Moreover, for **every** partition $P$,

$$L(f,P) \;\le\; \underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; U(f,P) ,$$

the outer inequalities because a member of a set is at most its supremum and at
least its infimum.

### Integrability

$f$ is **Darboux integrable on $[a,b]$**, and on this page simply
**integrable**, when

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;=\; \overline{\int_a^b} f ,$$

and then the common value is written

$$\int_a^b f \qquad \text{or} \qquad \int_a^b f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x ,$$

the **integral of $f$ over $[a,b]$**. It is a single well-determined real
number, being the common value of two numbers each of which is unique
([[lem-sup-unique]]). Without the displayed equality the symbol $\int_a^b f$ is
not defined and is never written.

**The inequality above is the whole difficulty.** By the previous paragraph
integrability is *never* a question of one integral exceeding the other, only of
the gap $\overline{\int_a^b} f - \underline{\int_a^b} f \ge 0$ being $0$; and by
[[thm-riemann-criterion]] that gap is $0$ exactly when a single partition can be
found making $U(f,P) - L(f,P)$ small. Whether that is possible is settled
completely, in terms of the discontinuities of $f$, by
[[thm-lebesgue-criterion]].

**"Riemann integrable" means the same thing here.** The definition above is
Darboux's. Riemann's own definition, in terms of tagged partitions of small
mesh, is [[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]], and the two define the same
class of functions with the same integral by [[thm-darboux-equals-riemann]].
Until that theorem is proved the two phrases are kept apart; after it they are
used interchangeably, as they are throughout the literature.

## Remarks

- **The supremum is over all partitions, and nothing is selected.** Both
  $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{U}$ are sets determined by $f$ and $[a,b]$ alone,
  and $\sup$ and $\inf$ are canonical, so no choice principle is involved in
  forming either integral. Where a choice does enter on this page is recorded in
  [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].

- **Why the lower integral is a supremum and not an infimum.** Refining a
  partition can only increase a lower sum and decrease an upper sum
  ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]]), so the lower sums push up towards the
  integral and the upper sums push down towards it. Taking $\inf \mathcal{L}$
  would return the sum over the coarsest partition and would carry no
  information about $f$ beyond its infimum on $[a,b]$.

- **A bounded $f$ always has both integrals; only their equality can fail.** The
  Dirichlet function on $[0,1]$ has lower integral $0$ and upper integral $1$
  ([[fs-bounded-implies-riemann-integrable]]), which is the standard witness that
  the definition above is not vacuous in either direction.

## Definition

Let $a < b$ be reals, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be **bounded**
([[def-bounded-set]]), so that there is a real $M \ge 0$ with $|f(x)| \le M$ for
every $x \in [a,b]$, and let $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ with
subintervals $I_i = [t_i, t_{i+1}]$ and lengths $\Delta_i = t_{i+1} - t_i$ for
$i < n$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

### The two extreme values on a subinterval

For $i < n$ put

$$m_i \;:=\; \inf f[I_i], \qquad M_i \;:=\; \sup f[I_i], \qquad f[I_i] \;=\; \{\, f(x) : x \in I_i \,\} .$$

**Both exist.** The set $f[I_i]$ is nonempty, because $t_i < t_{i+1}$ makes $I_i$
nonempty ([[def-interval]]), and it is bounded, because $|f(x)| \le M$ for every
$x$ ([[def-bounded-set]]). A nonempty set bounded above has a supremum
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and a nonempty set bounded below has an infimum
([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]); each is unique, so the notations
$\inf f[I_i]$ and $\sup f[I_i]$ name single real numbers ([[lem-sup-unique]]).

**They bracket the values, and each other.** For $x \in I_i$,

$$-M \;\le\; m_i \;\le\; f(x) \;\le\; M_i \;\le\; M ,$$

the outer inequalities because $-M$ is a lower bound and $M$ an upper bound of
$f[I_i]$, and the middle ones by the definitions of infimum and supremum. In
particular $m_i \le M_i$ and $M_i - m_i \le 2M$.

The dependence of $m_i$ and $M_i$ on $f$ and on $P$ is suppressed in the
notation, as is customary; where two partitions are in play the sums below carry
the partition and the extreme values are written out.

### The two Darboux sums

$$L(f,P) \;:=\; \sum_{i<n} m_i \,\Delta_i, \qquad U(f,P) \;:=\; \sum_{i<n} M_i \,\Delta_i ,$$

the finite sums of [[def-finite-sum]], indexed by $i \in \mathbb{N}$ with
$i < n$. Both are real numbers, being finite sums of reals, and

$$L(f,P) \;\le\; U(f,P) ,$$

by monotonicity of finite sums, clause 4 of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], since
$m_i \Delta_i \le M_i \Delta_i$ for every $i < n$: multiplying $m_i \le M_i$ by
$\Delta_i > 0$ preserves the inequality ([[def-ordered-field]]).

### The gap on a subinterval is the oscillation there

For every $i < n$,

$$M_i - m_i \;=\; \omega_f(I_i) \;=\; \sup\{\, |f(x) - f(y)| \ : \ x, y \in I_i \,\} ,$$

the oscillation of $f$ on the set $I_i$ ([[def-oscillation]]). The supremum is a
real number here rather than an extended one, because $f$ is bounded
([[def-oscillation]], [[def-extended-reals]]). The identity is proved in two
inequalities.

*The oscillation is at most the gap.* For $x, y \in I_i$ both $f(x)$ and $f(y)$
lie in $[m_i, M_i]$, so $f(x) - f(y) \le M_i - m_i$ and
$f(y) - f(x) \le M_i - m_i$, whence $|f(x) - f(y)| \le M_i - m_i$
([[lem-of-abs-value]]). So $M_i - m_i$ is an upper bound of the set whose
supremum is $\omega_f(I_i)$.

*The gap is at most the oscillation.* Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real. By the
$\varepsilon$-characterisations of the supremum and the infimum
([[lem-sup-epsilon]], [[lem-inf-epsilon]]) there are $x, y \in I_i$ with
$f(x) > M_i - \varepsilon/2$ and $f(y) < m_i + \varepsilon/2$; then

$$|f(x) - f(y)| \;\ge\; f(x) - f(y) \;>\; (M_i - m_i) - \varepsilon ,$$

so $\omega_f(I_i) > (M_i - m_i) - \varepsilon$. As $\varepsilon > 0$ was
arbitrary, $\omega_f(I_i) \ge M_i - m_i$: otherwise
$\varepsilon := (M_i - m_i) - \omega_f(I_i)$ would be positive and give
$\omega_f(I_i) > \omega_f(I_i)$.

This identity is what connects the Darboux machinery to the pointwise
oscillation of [[def-oscillation]], and it is the hinge of
[[thm-lebesgue-criterion]].

## Remarks

- **Boundedness is a hypothesis of the definition, not of the theorems.** Without
  it $f[I_i]$ may fail to have a supremum in $\mathbb{R}$ and $U(f,P)$ is not
  defined at all. Every statement on this page that mentions $L$ or $U$ therefore
  carries "bounded $f$" in its hypotheses, and none of them is a restriction that
  could be lifted: an unbounded function has no Darboux sums to compare.

- **Why the infimum and the supremum, and not a value of $f$.** Replacing $m_i$
  by $f(\xi_i)$ for a point $\xi_i \in I_i$ gives the Riemann sums of
  [[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]], which depend on a choice of points
  and are not extremal. The Darboux sums are canonical functions of $f$ and $P$
  alone, which is what makes the supremum and infimum over all partitions in
  [[def-darboux-integral]] well posed without any selection.

- **The empty sum does not occur.** A partition has $n \ge 1$
  ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]), so $L(f,P)$ and $U(f,P)$ are sums of at
  least one term. The first term is $m_0 \Delta_0$, over the subinterval
  $[a, t_1]$; the indexing starts at $i = 0$ throughout this page.

## Definition

Throughout this page $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), in particular an ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]]) and a field ([[def-field]]), and $\mathbb{N}$ is the set
of natural numbers ([[def-natural-numbers]]) with successor $\sigma(n) = n + 1$
([[def-nat-addition]]).

Let $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a sequence of reals, written $a_k$ for
$a(k)$. **Finite sums and finite products of $a$ are defined by recursion on the
upper index**, which is legitimate because of the recursion theorem
([[thm-recursion]]). That theorem produces a function of one variable, so the
running index has to be carried along inside the value: applying it to the set
$A = \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$, the starting element $(0, 0)$ and the function
$f(n, s) = (\sigma(n),\, s + a_n)$ gives a unique
$g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$ with

$$g(0) = (0, 0), \qquad g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n)) \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Write $g(n) = \big(\pi_1(g(n)),\, \Sigma_n\big)$ for its two coordinates.

**The first coordinate is the index itself, and that is a small induction, not an
observation** ([[thm-induction-principle]]). Indeed $\pi_1(g(0)) = 0$; and if
$\pi_1(g(n)) = n$, then
$g(\sigma(n)) = f\big(\pi_1(g(n)), \Sigma_n\big) = \big(\sigma(\pi_1(g(n))),\, \Sigma_n + a_{\pi_1(g(n))}\big) = \big(\sigma(n),\, \Sigma_n + a_n\big)$,
so $\pi_1(g(\sigma(n))) = \sigma(n)$. By induction $\pi_1(g(n)) = n$ for every
$n \in \mathbb{N}$. Only now may the second coordinate of the two displayed
clauses be read off, and doing so gives

$$\Sigma_0 = 0, \qquad \Sigma_{\sigma(n)} = \Sigma_n + a_n .$$

$\Sigma$ is moreover the **unique** function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with those
two properties: if $\Sigma'$ also has them then $n \mapsto (n, \Sigma'_n)$ satisfies
the two clauses defining $g$, hence equals $g$ by the uniqueness clause of
[[thm-recursion]], so $\Sigma' = \Sigma$.

We write $\sum_{k < n} a_k := \Sigma_n$. The same construction with starting
element $(0, 1)$ and $f(n, p) = (\sigma(n),\, p \cdot a_n)$, with the same
induction on the first coordinate and the same uniqueness argument, gives the
unique $\Pi : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with

$$\Pi_0 = 1, \qquad \Pi_{\sigma(n)} = \Pi_n \cdot a_n ,$$

and we write $\prod_{k < n} a_k := \Pi_n$.

**Notation.** For $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ we abbreviate

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \sum_{k < n+1} a_k, \qquad \prod_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \prod_{k < n+1} a_k,$$

and, for a general lower index $m$ with $m \le n + 1$, writing $d = n + 1 - m$
for the number of terms,

$$\sum_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \sum_{j < d} a_{m+j}, \qquad \prod_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \prod_{j < d} a_{m+j} .$$

When $m = n + 1$ we have $d = 0$ and the sum is **empty**, with value $0$, while
the empty product has value $1$. In the same spirit $\sum_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ is
notation for the empty sum $\Sigma_0 = 0$ and $\prod_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ for the
empty product $\Pi_0 = 1$; the index $-1$ never occurs as an element of
$\mathbb{N}$ and is only a way of writing "no terms".

Only finitely many values of $a$ enter $\sum_{k<n} a_k$, so the notation
$\sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\prod_{k<n} a_k$ is also used for a list
$a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$ of reals given without reference to any extension of the
list to all of $\mathbb{N}$: extend the list by $a_k = 0$ (respectively
$a_k = 1$) for $k \ge n$ and apply the definition above.

## Remarks

- **Why recursion and not "$a_0 + a_1 + \cdots + a_{n-1}$".** The dots are not a
  definition: they presuppose that the displayed pattern determines a value for
  every $n$, which is exactly what the recursion theorem
  ([[thm-recursion]]) supplies, and its uniqueness clause is what makes
  $\sum_{k<n} a_k$ a single well-determined real rather than a family of choices.
  Associativity and commutativity of addition are *not* used in the definition;
  they are used in the laws proved from it ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).
- **Naturals and rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$ (a convention used on the whole
  page).** A natural number $n$ and a rational number $r$ are not literally
  elements of $\mathbb{R}$: they enter $\mathbb{R}$ through the canonical
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$, which is an injective,
  order-preserving field homomorphism ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), restricting on
  positive naturals to $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} = 1_\mathbb{R} + \cdots + 1_\mathbb{R}$
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). Following ordinary practice, and only where no
  confusion is possible, we write $n$ for $\iota(n)$ and $r$ for $\iota(r)$; so,
  for instance, $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k<n} a_k$ means
  $\iota(n)^{-1} \cdot \sum_{k<n} a_k$, which makes sense because
  $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$. Exponents are the one place where the
  identification is deliberately NOT made: in $a^n$ and $a^r$ the exponent stays
  a natural, an integer or a rational ([[def-integer-power]],
  [[def-rational-power]]), never a real.
- The two indexings are related by $\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k = \sum_{k < n+1} a_k$, so
  a statement proved for one is available for the other. Sums over $k < n$ are
  the primitive form here because $\Sigma_0$, the empty sum, is then the base
  case of every induction, and no index outside $\mathbb{N}$ is ever needed.

## Definition

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $\ell \in \mathbb{R}$. Then $\ell$ is a
**greatest lower bound**, or **infimum**, of $S$ if both of the following hold:

- $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$ ([[def-bounded-set]]), that is, $\ell \le s$ for
  every $s \in S$;
- $\ell' \le \ell$ for every lower bound $\ell'$ of $S$.

Written out in one line:

$$\ell \text{ is an infimum of } S \iff \big[(\forall s \in S)\, \ell \le s\big] \text{ and } \big[(\forall \ell' \in \mathbb{R})\, \big((\forall s \in S)\, \ell' \le s\big) \Rightarrow \ell' \le \ell\big].$$

An infimum, when it exists, is unique ([[lem-sup-unique]]), so we may write
$\inf S$ for it.

## Remarks

- This is the exact dual of the least upper bound (supremum) of
  [[def-complete-ordered-field]]: reverse every inequality and swap "least" for
  "greatest". The two notions are related by reflection through $0$
  ([[lem-reflection]]).
- Existence is deliberately *not* part of the definition. That every nonempty
  subset of $\mathbb{R}$ which is bounded below actually has an infimum is a
  theorem, [[thm-infimum-property]], derived from the least-upper-bound property;
  it is not an axiom and it is not free.
- As with a supremum, an infimum need not belong to $S$; when it does, it is the
  minimum of $S$ ([[def-max-min]]).
- The usable form of the definition in later arguments is the epsilon
  characterisation [[lem-inf-epsilon]]: $\ell = \inf S$ exactly when $\ell$ is a
  lower bound that cannot be raised by any positive amount without losing that
  property.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $m \in \mathbb{R}$.

- $m$ is a **maximum** (or *greatest element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $s \le m$
  for every $s \in S$.
- $m$ is a **minimum** (or *least element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $m \le s$
  for every $s \in S$.

A set has at most one maximum: if $m_1$ and $m_2$ are both maxima then
$m_1 \in S$ gives $m_1 \le m_2$ and $m_2 \in S$ gives $m_2 \le m_1$, so
$m_1 = m_2$ by antisymmetry of the order, which is immediate from the trichotomy
axiom of an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).
The same argument applies to minima, so we may write $\max S$ and $\min S$.

## Remarks

- A maximum is precisely an upper bound of $S$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]])
  that happens to lie in $S$; a minimum is a lower bound of $S$
  ([[def-bounded-set]]) that lies in $S$. In particular a set with a maximum is
  bounded above and a set with a minimum is bounded below.
- The empty set has neither a maximum nor a minimum, because the requirement
  $m \in S$ cannot be met.
- The membership requirement $m \in S$ is exactly what separates a maximum from a
  supremum, and it is the theme of this page. A supremum is a bound on the set
  and is not asked to belong to it; a maximum is an element of the set. The two
  agree exactly when the supremum happens to be attained ([[lem-max-is-sup]]),
  and they genuinely differ in general ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has both a maximum and a minimum
  ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]), which is what licenses the notation
  $\max\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$. Infinite sets need not: the failure of attainment is
  an infinitary phenomenon.

([[def-real-order]]). Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and let
$f : A \to \mathbb{R}$. Then $f$ is:

- **nondecreasing** when $f(x) \le f(y)$ for all $x, y \in A$ with $x \le y$;
- **increasing**, or *strictly increasing*, when $f(x) < f(y)$ for all
  $x, y \in A$ with $x < y$;
- **nonincreasing** when $f(x) \ge f(y)$ for all $x, y \in A$ with $x \le y$;
- **decreasing**, or *strictly decreasing*, when $f(x) > f(y)$ for all
  $x, y \in A$ with $x < y$;
- **monotone** when it is nondecreasing or nonincreasing;
- **strictly monotone** when it is increasing or decreasing.

The naming follows the convention of [[def-monotone-sequence]], which is the
convention of this library throughout: *increasing* is the strict notion and
*nondecreasing* the weak one.

**An increasing function is nondecreasing, and a decreasing function is
nonincreasing.** For $x \le y$ either $x < y$, and then $f(x) < f(y)$, hence
$f(x) \le f(y)$; or $x = y$, and then $f(x) = f(y)$. The same argument with the
inequalities reversed gives the second claim. So strictly monotone implies
monotone.

**A strictly monotone function is injective**
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]). Let $f$ be increasing and let
$x, y \in A$ with $x \ne y$. By trichotomy either $x < y$, and then
$f(x) < f(y)$, or $y < x$, and then $f(y) < f(x)$; in both cases
$f(x) \ne f(y)$. The decreasing case is the same argument. The converse fails,
and the failure is not exotic: a continuous injection on an interval *is*
strictly monotone ([[thm-continuous-injection-on-an-interval-is-strictly-monotone]]),
but on a domain that is not an interval it need not be.

**Negation exchanges the two directions.** For $g := -f$, that is
$g(x) := -f(x)$, the four conditions above are exchanged in pairs: $f$ is
nondecreasing exactly when $g$ is nonincreasing, and $f$ is increasing exactly
when $g$ is decreasing, because $u \le v$ holds exactly when $-v \le -u$
([[def-ordered-field]]). Several proofs below use this to reduce a nonincreasing
case to a nondecreasing one.

**Monotone on a set, not at a point.** All six conditions are conditions on the
whole of $A$; unlike continuity ([[def-continuity-real]]) there is no pointwise
version, and none is used in this library. The domain $A$ is an arbitrary subset
of $\mathbb{R}$; where a result needs $A$ to be an interval
([[def-interval]]) it says so, and the hypothesis is never decoration.

### The dictionary to monotone sequences

A sequence of reals is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$
([[def-sequence]]), and [[def-monotone-sequence]] calls it nondecreasing when
$x_j \le x_k$ for all $j \le k$, increasing when $x_j < x_k$ for all $j < k$,
and so on. Those are **the same four conditions as above**, read with the
ordered set $\mathbb{N}$ in place of the ordered subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$
and with the comparison of indices in place of the comparison of arguments. So
nothing new is introduced here for sequences, and the two vocabularies may be
used interchangeably: the words *nondecreasing*, *increasing*, *nonincreasing*,
*decreasing*, *monotone* and *strictly monotone* mean the corresponding
condition on the domain at hand.

One consequence is used repeatedly, and it has to be stated carefully because
composition does **not** simply preserve the four words. Let $(x_k)$ be a
**nondecreasing** sequence with $x_k \in A$ for every $k$, so that $j \le k$ gives
$x_j \le x_k$. Then:

- if $f$ is nondecreasing, $(f(x_k))$ is nondecreasing, since $f(x_j) \le f(x_k)$;
- if $f$ is nonincreasing, $(f(x_k))$ is **nonincreasing**, since
  $f(x_j) \ge f(x_k)$.

So along a nondecreasing sequence the composite inherits the direction of $f$;
and with $(x_k)$ increasing and $f$ increasing, $(f(x_k))$ is increasing, while
with $(x_k)$ increasing and $f$ decreasing, $(f(x_k))$ is decreasing.

**Along a nonincreasing sequence the direction is reversed, not inherited.** If
$(x_k)$ is nonincreasing and $f$ is nonincreasing, then $j \le k$ gives
$x_j \ge x_k$ and hence $f(x_j) \le f(x_k)$: the composite is **nondecreasing**.
The witness is $f(x) = -x$ on $A = \mathbb{R}$ with $x_k = -k$, where both $f$ and
$(x_k)$ are decreasing and $f(x_k) = k$ is increasing. Two order-reversing maps
compose to an order-preserving one, exactly as for the four words applied to
functions.

## Definition

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ ([[def-field]]) together with a subset
$P \subseteq F$, the set of **positive** elements (the *positive cone*),
satisfying:

- **(O1) Trichotomy.** For each $x \in F$, exactly one of the following holds:
  $x \in P$, or $x = 0$, or $-x \in P$.
- **(O2) Closure.** If $x, y \in P$ then $x + y \in P$ and $x \cdot y \in P$.

We write $x > 0$ for $x \in P$ (read "$x$ is positive"), and define the order by

$$a < b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; b - a \in P, \qquad a \le b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; a < b \text{ or } a = b.$$

Thus $a > b$ means $b < a$, and $a \ge b$ means $b \le a$. An element $x$ with
$-x \in P$ (equivalently $x < 0$) is called **negative**.

## Remarks

- By trichotomy applied to $b - a$, for any $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$,
  $a = b$, $a > b$ holds; this makes $\le$ a total order.
- (O2) says the positives are closed under addition and multiplication: sums and
  products of positives are positive.
- The rationals ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and both constructions of the reals
  ([[thm-reals-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-dedekind-ordered-field]]) are ordered
  fields, so every fact proved here from (O1)-(O2) holds in each of them.

## Definition

**Why this item is first.** The published definition of the integral does not
cover this page. [[def-darboux-integral]] is stated for reals $a < b$, because
the partitions it quantifies over are those of [[def-partition-and-refinement]],
whose standing hypothesis is $a < b$: with $a = b$ the chain
$a = t_0 < \dots < t_n = b$ is unsatisfiable. So $\int_a^b f$ is an undefined
symbol whenever $a \ge b$, and every additivity statement below would be
ill-formed as it is usually written. This item extends the notation, and nothing
else: the object it names is still the Darboux integral of
[[def-darboux-integral]].

Let $u, v \in \mathbb{R}$ and write

$$[u \wedge v,\ u \vee v] \;:=\; \text{the closed interval with endpoints } u \text{ and } v$$

([[def-interval]]). Let $f$ be a real-valued function whose domain contains that
interval. Say that **$f$ is integrable between $u$ and $v$** when either $u = v$,
or $u \ne v$ and the restriction of $f$ to $[u \wedge v,\ u \vee v]$ is bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]) and Darboux integrable there ([[def-darboux-integral]],
[[def-darboux-sums]]). For such $f$ define

$$\int_u^v f \;:=\; \begin{cases} \text{the Darboux integral of } f \text{ over } [u,v] & \text{if } u < v, \\[2pt] 0 & \text{if } u = v, \\[2pt] -\displaystyle\int_v^u f & \text{if } u > v. \end{cases}$$

**There is nothing to check for consistency.** The three clauses are indexed by
the three cases of trichotomy, $u < v$, $u = v$ and $u > v$, which are mutually
exclusive and exhaustive; no pair of them ever applies to the same $(u,v)$. In
particular the first clause is untouched, so on $u < v$ this is the published
integral verbatim and every published theorem about it applies unchanged.

**The middle clause is a stipulation, not a computation.** It is *not* claimed
that $0$ is a value forced by the $u < v$ definition in any limiting sense; that
definition simply says nothing at $u = v$, and $\int_u^u f := 0$ is what is
written there. It is also unconditional: no hypothesis on $f$ beyond being
defined at $u$ is asked for, since the case $u = v$ never refers to a partition.

### The two consequences used throughout the page

**Antisymmetry, for every pair.** For all reals $u, v$ with $f$ integrable
between them,

$$\int_u^v f \;=\; -\int_v^u f .$$

Indeed if $u < v$ then $v > u$ and the third clause reads
$\int_v^u f = -\int_u^v f$, which rearranges to the display; if $u = v$ both
sides are $0$; and if $u > v$ the third clause is the display itself.

**Absolute values agree.** Consequently
$\bigl|\int_u^v f\bigr| = \bigl|\int_v^u f\bigr|$ for every such pair.

**An obligation recorded here and discharged elsewhere.** With this convention
the additivity identity

$$\int_u^v f \;+\; \int_v^w f \;=\; \int_u^w f$$

holds for **every** arrangement of $u, v, w$ in an interval on which $f$ is
integrable, not only for $u < v < w$. That is a theorem and not part of this
definition; it is proved as the last clause of
[[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]], and nothing on this page uses it before it
is proved there.

## Remarks

- **This is notation, and it is a real notation.** Without it the substitution
  theorem could not be stated with the limits $\varphi(c)$ and $\varphi(d)$ in
  the order the map produces them, since a differentiable $\varphi$ need be
  neither injective nor monotone; and the integral function $x \mapsto \int_a^x f$
  would be undefined at $x = a$.

- **One published inequality is not orientation-invariant, and that is a trap.**
  The estimate $\bigl|\int_u^v f\bigr| \le \int_u^v |f|$ is guaranteed only
  for $u \le v$: at $u > v$ the right-hand side is $-\int_v^u |f| \le 0$ while
  the left-hand side is $\ge 0$, so the inequality fails whenever
  $\int_v^u |f| > 0$. The form valid for every pair is
  $\bigl|\int_u^v f\bigr| \le \bigl|\int_u^v |f|\bigr|$, and this is stated where
  it is proved ([[cor-integrability-of-absolute-values-products-and-lattice-operations]]).

- **Integrability is a property of the unordered pair.** By construction, $f$ is
  integrable between $u$ and $v$ if and only if it is integrable between $v$ and
  $u$, since both refer to the same closed interval; only the sign of the value
  remembers the order.

## Definition

**Standing hypothesis for this page.** Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete
ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]),
$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers and **contains $0$**
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[def-nat-order]]), $\iota : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$
is the canonical natural ([[def-canonical-natural]]), and $a, b$ are reals with

$$a \;<\; b .$$

Intervals and their lengths are those of [[def-interval]]; finite sums are those
of [[def-finite-sum]], indexed as $\sum_{i<n}$ over $i \in \mathbb{N}$.

### Partitions

A **partition of $[a,b]$** is a pair $P = (n, t)$ consisting of a natural number
$n \ge 1$ and a sequence $t : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-sequence]]) with

$$t_0 = a, \qquad t_i < t_{i+1} \ \text{ for every } i < n, \qquad t_k = b \ \text{ for every } k \ge n .$$

The tail convention on the third clause is bookkeeping only: it makes $t$ a
genuine sequence, so that the finite-sum laws of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] apply to
it verbatim, and it costs nothing because no index above $n$ is ever read. The
first two clauses say exactly that

$$a \;=\; t_0 \;<\; t_1 \;<\; \dots \;<\; t_n \;=\; b ,$$

the last equality because $t_n = b$ by the third clause. In particular
$i \mapsto t_i$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on
$\{\, i \in \mathbb{N} : i \le n \,\}$ ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]),
and $a \le t_i \le b$ for every $i \le n$.

The **point set** of $P$ is the finite set

$$\operatorname{pts}(P) \;:=\; \{\, t_i \ : \ i \le n \,\} \;\subseteq\; [a,b], \qquad a, b \in \operatorname{pts}(P) .$$

The **subintervals** of $P$ are

$$I_i \;:=\; [\,t_i,\ t_{i+1}\,] \qquad (i < n),$$

and their **lengths** are $\Delta_i := t_{i+1} - t_i$. Each $\Delta_i > 0$, so
each $I_i$ is a nondegenerate closed bounded interval ([[def-interval]]). There
are $n$ of them and they are indexed from $i = 0$, not from $i = 1$: the first
subinterval is $[t_0, t_1] = [a, t_1]$.

**The lengths sum to $b - a$.** By the telescoping law, clause 5 of
[[lem-finite-sum-laws]],

$$\sum_{i<n} \Delta_i \;=\; \sum_{i<n} (t_{i+1} - t_i) \;=\; t_n - t_0 \;=\; b - a .$$

**The mesh.** The set $\{\, \Delta_i : i < n \,\}$ is a nonempty finite set of
reals, nonempty because $n \ge 1$, so it has a maximum
([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]). The **mesh** of $P$ is

$$\|P\| \;:=\; \max\{\, \Delta_i \ : \ i < n \,\} \;>\; 0 ,$$

and $\Delta_i \le \|P\|$ for every $i < n$.

**The uniform partition.** For a natural $N \ge 1$, the **uniform partition of
$[a,b]$ into $N$ parts** is $U_N := (N, t)$ with

$$t_i \;:=\; a + \iota(i)\,\frac{b-a}{\iota(N)} \quad (i \le N), \qquad t_k := b \quad (k \ge N).$$

This is a partition: $t_0 = a$; $t_N = a + (b-a) = b$; and $t_{i+1} - t_i =
(b-a)/\iota(N) > 0$ for $i < N$, because $\iota(N) > 0$ and $\iota(i+1) =
\iota(i) + 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[def-canonical-natural]]). Its
subinterval lengths are all equal to $(b-a)/\iota(N)$, so

$$\|U_N\| \;=\; \frac{b-a}{\iota(N)} .$$

### A partition is determined by its point set

**Claim.** If $P = (n,t)$ and $P' = (n', t')$ are partitions of $[a,b]$ with
$\operatorname{pts}(P) = \operatorname{pts}(P')$, then $n = n'$ and $t_i = t'_i$
for every $i \le n$.

*Proof.* First, $t_i = t'_i$ for every $i \le \min\{n,n'\}$, by induction on $i$
([[thm-induction-principle]]). For $i = 0$ both equal $a$. Suppose $t_j = t'_j$
for all $j \le i$ and $i + 1 \le \min\{n,n'\}$. The set
$S := \{\, x \in \operatorname{pts}(P) : x > t_i \,\}$ has $t_{i+1}$ as its least
element: $t_{i+1} \in S$, and any $x \in S$ is $t_j$ for some $j \le n$ with
$t_j > t_i$, which forces $j > i$ because $t$ is increasing on indices $\le n$,
hence $j \ge i+1$ and $x = t_j \ge t_{i+1}$. The same argument in $P'$ makes
$t'_{i+1}$ the least element of
$\{\, x \in \operatorname{pts}(P') : x > t'_i \,\}$, which is the same set $S$,
since the point sets agree and $t'_i = t_i$. A set has at most one least element
([[def-max-min]]), so $t_{i+1} = t'_{i+1}$.

Second, $n = n'$. If $n < n'$ then $t'_n = t_n = b$ by the previous paragraph,
while $t'_n < t'_{n'} = b$ because $t'$ is increasing on indices $\le n'$ and
$n < n'$; that is impossible. Exchanging the roles of $P$ and $P'$ rules out
$n' < n$. $\square$

So the map $P \mapsto \operatorname{pts}(P)$ is injective, and a partition may be
named by its point set whenever one is exhibited.

### Inserting a point

Let $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ and let $c \in [a,b]$. Define a
partition $P + c$ of $[a,b]$ as follows.

- If $c \in \operatorname{pts}(P)$, put $P + c := P$.
- Otherwise $c \ne a$ and $c \ne b$, so $a < c < b$. The set
  $T := \{\, t_i : i \le n \text{ and } t_i < c \,\}$ is a nonempty finite set of
  reals, nonempty because $t_0 = a < c$, so it has a maximum
  ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]); let $i_0 \le n$ be the unique index with
  $t_{i_0} = \max T$, unique because $t$ is injective on indices $\le n$. Then
  $i_0 < n$, since $t_n = b > c$ puts $t_n \notin T$; and
  $$t_{i_0} \;<\; c \;<\; t_{i_0+1},$$
  the right inequality because $t_{i_0+1} \ne c$ (as $c \notin \operatorname{pts}(P)$)
  and $t_{i_0+1} < c$ would put $t_{i_0+1} \in T$ with $t_{i_0+1} > t_{i_0} = \max T$.
  Put $P + c := (n+1, s)$ with
  $$s_i := t_i \ (i \le i_0), \qquad s_{i_0+1} := c, \qquad s_i := t_{i-1} \ (i_0 + 2 \le i \le n+1), \qquad s_k := b \ (k \ge n+1).$$

In both cases $P + c$ is a partition of $[a,b]$ and

$$\operatorname{pts}(P + c) \;=\; \operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \{c\}, \qquad \|P+c\| \;\le\; \|P\| .$$

The displayed identity is immediate from the two cases. For the mesh: in the
first case nothing changes; in the second the list of subinterval lengths of
$P + c$ is that of $P$ with $\Delta_{i_0}$ replaced by the two numbers
$c - t_{i_0}$ and $t_{i_0+1} - c$, each of which is smaller than
$\Delta_{i_0} = (c - t_{i_0}) + (t_{i_0+1} - c)$ because the other is positive.
So every length of $P + c$ is at most a length of $P$, and the maximum cannot
increase. Finally the index count grows by exactly $1$ in the second case and
not at all in the first.

### Refinement and the common refinement

$P'$ **refines** $P$, and is a **refinement** of $P$, when

$$\operatorname{pts}(P) \;\subseteq\; \operatorname{pts}(P') .$$

Let $P = (n,t)$ and $Q = (m,s)$ be partitions of $[a,b]$. Applying the recursion
theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) to the set $\mathbb{N} \times \mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$,
where $\mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$ is the set of partitions of $[a,b]$, with starting
element $(0, P)$ and the map $(j, R) \mapsto (j+1,\ R + s_j)$ — legitimate
because $s_j \in [a,b]$ for every $j \in \mathbb{N}$ — gives a unique family
$(R_j)_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ of partitions with $R_0 = P$ and $R_{j+1} = R_j + s_j$.
The **common refinement** of $P$ and $Q$ is

$$P \vee Q \;:=\; R_{m+1} .$$

**Its point set is the union.** By induction on $j$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]),
$\operatorname{pts}(R_j) = \operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \{\, s_l : l < j \,\}$;
taking $j = m+1$ gives

$$\operatorname{pts}(P \vee Q) \;=\; \operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \operatorname{pts}(Q).$$

Hence $P \vee Q$ refines both $P$ and $Q$; by the uniqueness claim above it is
the **only** partition with that point set, so $P \vee Q = Q \vee P$, and

$$P' \text{ refines } P \quad \Longrightarrow \quad P \vee P' = P' ,$$

since then $\operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \operatorname{pts}(P') =
\operatorname{pts}(P')$.

**Two size bounds, both used later.** Writing $n_R$ for the first component of a
partition $R$:

$$\|P \vee Q\| \;\le\; \|P\|, \qquad n_{P \vee Q} \;\le\; n_P + n_Q - 1 .$$

The first is the mesh bound above applied $m+1$ times. For the second, each
insertion raises the index count by at most $1$, and the two insertions of
$s_0 = a$ and $s_m = b$ raise it by $0$, since $a$ and $b$ already lie in
$\operatorname{pts}(P)$ and hence in $\operatorname{pts}(R_j)$ for every $j$; so
at most $m - 1$ of the $m+1$ insertions increase it.

### The index map of a refinement

Let $P' = (n',t')$ refine $P = (n,t)$. For each $i \le n$ the point $t_i$ lies in
$\operatorname{pts}(P')$, so there is exactly one $\varphi(i) \le n'$ with
$t'_{\varphi(i)} = t_i$, uniqueness because $t'$ is injective on indices $\le n'$.
The resulting map $\varphi$ satisfies

$$\varphi(0) = 0, \qquad \varphi(n) = n', \qquad \varphi(i) < \varphi(i+1) \ \ (i < n),$$

the first two because $t'_0 = a = t_0$ and $t'_{n'} = b = t_n$ together with
injectivity, and the third because $t_i < t_{i+1}$ and $t'$ is increasing on
indices $\le n'$. In particular $n \le n'$. Moreover, for $i < n$ and
$\varphi(i) \le j < \varphi(i+1)$,

$$I'_j \;=\; [\,t'_j,\ t'_{j+1}\,] \;\subseteq\; [\,t_i,\ t_{i+1}\,] \;=\; I_i ,$$

because $t_i = t'_{\varphi(i)} \le t'_j$ and $t'_{j+1} \le t'_{\varphi(i+1)} = t_{i+1}$.

**The blocks are counted by telescoping.** By clause 5 of
[[lem-finite-sum-laws]],
$\sum_{i<n}\big(\varphi(i+1) - \varphi(i)\big) = \varphi(n) - \varphi(0) = n'$,
so, subtracting $\sum_{i<n} 1 = n$,

$$\sum_{i<n} \big(\varphi(i+1) - \varphi(i) - 1\big) \;=\; n' - n ,$$

a sum of $n$ nonnegative integers, one for each block, which vanishes exactly at
the blocks consisting of a single index. This identity is the whole content of
the quantitative bound in [[lem-refinement-inequalities]], and it is also why
$n \le n'$.

Finally, the lengths inside a block sum to the length of the block:

$$\sum_{j = \varphi(i)}^{\varphi(i+1)-1} \Delta'_j \;=\; t'_{\varphi(i+1)} - t'_{\varphi(i)} \;=\; t_{i+1} - t_i \;=\; \Delta_i \qquad (i < n),$$

again by telescoping, applied to the sequence $l \mapsto t'_{\varphi(i)+l}$ and
read through the index-shift convention of [[def-finite-sum]].

## Remarks

- **Why $a < b$ is a standing hypothesis and not a case.** With $a = b$ the
  displayed chain $a = t_0 < \dots < t_n = b$ is unsatisfiable for $n \ge 1$, and
  admitting $n = 0$ would give a partition with no subintervals, an empty mesh
  set and no maximum. Every statement on this page is about a nondegenerate
  closed bounded interval, and the convention $\int_a^a f := 0$ is not adopted
  here because nothing below needs it.

- **The subintervals overlap at their shared endpoints, and that is harmless.**
  $I_i \cap I_{i+1} = \{t_{i+1}\}$, so the union $\bigcup_{i<n} I_i = [a,b]$ is
  not disjoint. Every quantity attached to a partition below is a sum over $i<n$
  of a number times $\Delta_i$, and a single point contributes length $0$, so no
  statement on this page is sensitive to the double counting of the $n-1$
  interior points.

- **Refinement is a relation between point sets, not between lists.** Defining it
  as "$P'$ is obtained from $P$ by inserting points" would be the same relation,
  by the uniqueness claim above, but it would make every proof carry an
  insertion order. The index map $\varphi$ recovers the list-level picture when
  it is wanted, and it is what [[lem-refinement-inequalities]] actually uses.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]), let $E \subseteq [a,b]$ be finite
([[def-countable]], [[def-equinumerous]]), and let $g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$
satisfy

$$g(x) \;=\; f(x) \qquad \text{for every } x \in [a,b] \setminus E .$$

Then $g$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ and

$$\int_a^b g \;=\; \int_a^b f .$$

In particular the values of an integrand at the endpoints of the interval, and at
any finite set of points, are irrelevant to both questions.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, an integrable $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, a finite $E \subseteq [a,b]$, and $g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ agreeing with $f$ off $E$. Finite means: there are $r \in \mathbb{N}$ and a bijection $e$ from $\{\, j \in \mathbb{N} : j < r \,\}$ onto $E$ ([[def-countable]], [[def-equinumerous]]).

[L1] Riemann's criterion ([[thm-riemann-criterion]]), and: an integrable function is bounded, since Darboux sums are defined only for bounded functions ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L2] For a partition $R = (n,t)$ and a bounded function $h$ on the interval: $L(h,R) = \sum_{i<n}m_i\Delta_i$, $U(h,R) = \sum_{i<n}M_i\Delta_i$ with $m_i = \inf h[I_i] \le M_i = \sup h[I_i]$, and $L(h,R) \le \underline{\int_a^b} h \le \overline{\int_a^b} h \le U(h,R)$ ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L3] The uniform partition $U_N$ of $[a,b]$ into $N \ge 1$ parts has $n = N$ and every $\Delta_i$ equal to $(b-a)/\iota(N)$, and its subintervals cover $[a,b]$; the index list $t$ is strictly increasing on indices $\le N$, hence injective there ([[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[def-interval]]).

[L4] Finite sums: monotonicity in the terms, scaling, additivity, and splitting; consequently, if $x_i = 0$ for every $i < n$ except $i = j$, then $\sum_{i<n}x_i = x_j$, by splitting at $j$ and at $j+1$ and $\sum 0 = 0$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], clauses 1 to 4).

[L5] Sums and scalar multiples of integrable functions are integrable, with the corresponding identity for the integrals ([[thm-linearity-of-the-integral]]); and the constant function $0$ is integrable with integral $0$ ([[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]]).

[L6] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N) < \eta$, and $\iota(N) > 0$ for $N \ge 1$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L7] Induction on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L8] Ordered-field arithmetic: multiplying an inequality by a nonnegative quantity and adding constants preserve it, the order is total and transitive, and a real of absolute value below every positive real is $0$ ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 **The one-point case is proved first, for a function called $w$ so that no symbol is reused.** Let $p \in [a,b]$ and let $w : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfy $w(x) = 0$ for every $x \ne p$; put $K := |w(p)|$, so $|w(x)| \le K$ for every $x$ and $w$ is bounded. [given, L1]

1.2 Fix $N \ge 1$ and write $U_N = (N,t)$ with subintervals $I_i$ and lengths $\Delta_i = (b-a)/\iota(N)$. Define $\theta_i := 1$ if $p \in I_i$ and $\theta_i := 0$ otherwise, for $i < N$. [L3, construct]

1.3 **Setting up the induction.** Put $h := g - f$, so that $h(x) = 0$ for every $x \notin E$, and for $j < r$ define $h_j : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ by $h_j(x) := h(x)$ if $x = e(j)$ and $h_j(x) := 0$ otherwise. Each $h_j$ vanishes off the single point $e(j)$. [given, construct]

2.1 At most two indices $i < N$ have $\theta_i = 1$, and they are consecutive: if $p \in I_i \cap I_j$ with $i < j$ then $t_j \le p \le t_{i+1}$ and $t_{i+1} \le t_j$, so $t_{i+1} = t_j$ and $j = i+1$ by injectivity of $t$. Also some index has $\theta_i = 1$, since the subintervals cover $[a,b]$; let $i_0$ be the least such. [step 1.2, L3, choose]

2.2 For every $x \in [a,b]$ and every $k \le r$, $\sum_{j<k} h_j(x) = h(x)$ when $x = e(j_0)$ for some $j_0 < k$, and $\sum_{j<k}h_j(x) = 0$ otherwise: in the first case all terms with $j \ne j_0$ vanish, because $e$ is injective, and [L4] evaluates the sum; in the second every term is $0$. [step 1.3, L4]

3.1 For every $i < N$: if $\theta_i = 0$ then $w$ vanishes on $I_i$, so $m_i = M_i = 0$, where $m_i$ and $M_i$ are the extreme values of $w$ on $I_i$; and always $-K\theta_i \le m_i \le M_i \le K\theta_i$. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L2, L8]

3.2 Define $y_i := \Delta_i$ for $i = i_0$ and $y_i := 0$ otherwise, and $z_i := \Delta_i$ for $i = i_0+1$ with $i_0 + 1 < N$, and $z_i := 0$ otherwise. Then $\theta_i\Delta_i \le y_i + z_i$ for every $i < N$ by step 2.1, and $\sum_{i<N}(y_i+z_i) \le 2(b-a)/\iota(N)$ by [L4] and [L3]. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L3, L4, construct]

3.3 Let $Q(k)$, for $k \le r$, be the statement that the function $H_k : x \mapsto \sum_{j<k}h_j(x)$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ with $\int_a^b H_k = 0$. [step 2.2, construct]

4.1 By step 3.1 and monotonicity of finite sums, $U(w,U_N) - L(w,U_N) = \sum_{i<N}(M_i-m_i)\Delta_i \le \sum_{i<N}2K\theta_i\Delta_i \le 4K(b-a)/\iota(N)$, and likewise $-2K(b-a)/\iota(N) \le L(w,U_N)$ and $U(w,U_N) \le 2K(b-a)/\iota(N)$. [step 3.1, step 3.2, L2, L4, L8]

4.2 **Base.** $H_0$ is the constant function $0$, integrable with integral $0$ by [L5], so $Q(0)$ holds. [base, step 3.3, L5]

4.3 **Induction hypothesis.** Fix $k < r$ and assume $Q(k)$. [ih, step 3.3]

5.1 Given a real $\eta > 0$, [L6] supplies $N$ with $4K(b-a)/\iota(N) < \eta$, so $w$ satisfies Riemann's criterion and is integrable by [L1]. [step 4.1, L1, L6, L8]

5.2 Moreover $|\int_a^b w| \le 2K(b-a)/\iota(N)$ for every $N \ge 1$ by step 4.1 and [L2], and the right-hand side is below every positive real by [L6]; hence $\int_a^b w = 0$. Steps 1.1 to 5.2 therefore prove: every function on $[a,b]$ vanishing off a single point is integrable with integral $0$. [step 4.1, L2, L6, L8]

6.1 $H_{k+1} = H_k + h_k$ pointwise by [L4], and $h_k$ is integrable with integral $0$ by steps 5.1 and 5.2 applied to $w := h_k$ and $p := e(k)$; so $H_{k+1}$ is integrable with $\int_a^b H_{k+1} = 0 + 0 = 0$ by [L5], which is $Q(k+1)$. [step 5.1, step 5.2, step 1.3, step 4.3, L4, L5]

7.1 By [L7] with steps 4.2 and 6.1, $Q(k)$ holds for every $k \le r$; at $k = r$, and by step 2.2, $H_r = h$, so $h$ is integrable with $\int_a^b h = 0$. [step 2.2, step 4.2, step 4.3, step 6.1, L7]

8.1 Hence $g = f + h$ is integrable with $\int_a^b g = \int_a^b f + 0 = \int_a^b f$ by [L5]. [step 7.1, L5, discharge-induction] ∎

## Remarks

- **The subtle point is that a partition point lies in two subintervals.** The subintervals of a partition are closed and overlap at their shared endpoints ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]), so the exceptional point $p$ may belong to two of them; step 2.1 proves that it belongs to at most two and that they are consecutive, and step 3.2 is what pays for that possibility, with the factor $2$ that survives into step 4.1.

- **Nothing here is an index-subset sum.** The indicator sequence $\theta$ of step 1.2 is a genuine sequence on $\{\,i : i<N\,\}$, and every estimate is applied term by term and then summed by the monotonicity clause of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], whose clauses are stated for $\sum_{i<n}$; no sum over a subset of the index range is used.

- **The contrast with the derivative is the point of the lemma.** Changing a function at one point can destroy differentiability at that point, and changes nothing at any other point, since a limit at $x \ne p$ may be taken over a neighbourhood excluding $p$; it changes no integral at all. This is also why the integral function of an integrable $f$ cannot detect a change of $f$ at a point, which is what [[fs-the-integral-function-is-always-a-primitive]] on the companion page turns into a refutation.

## Statement

Let $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be sequences of reals, let
$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, and let $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, with finite sums and
finite products as in [[def-finite-sum]]. Then:

1. **Additivity.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k$.
2. **Scaling.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k$; in particular $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda = n\lambda$, where $n$ denotes the canonical natural $\iota(n) \in \mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).
3. **Splitting.** If $m \le n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k$, and $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n} a_k = \Big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k\Big)$.
4. **Monotonicity.** If $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$. In particular, if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, every single term satisfies $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$ for $j < n$, and $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ forces $a_k = 0$ for every $k < n$.
5. **Telescoping.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}\big(c_{k+1} - c_k\big) = c_n - c_0$.
6. **Products.** $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k) = \Big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\Big)$; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, and if $a_k > 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k > 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\lambda$, and naturals $m, n$. Write $\Sigma_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\Pi_n = \prod_{k<n} a_k$.

[L1] Recursion clauses ([[def-finite-sum]]): $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ and $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n$; $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1$ and $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) \cdot a_n$; and $\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k = \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j}$ for $m \le n$, likewise for products.

[L2] Field axioms: addition and multiplication are associative and commutative, $0$ and $1$ are the identities, $x - x = 0$, and multiplication distributes over addition ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]); and $0 \cdot x = 0$, which is not an axiom but a lemma ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

[L3] Induction principle: a property holding at $0$ and inherited by successors holds at every natural ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L4] Adding inequalities: $x \le y$ and $u \le v$ imply $x + u \le y + v$. [[lem-of-add-order]] states the STRICT forms and only those ($x < y \Rightarrow x + c < y + c$, and $x < y$ with $u < v$ giving $x + u < y + v$); the nonstrict form used throughout below is those two together with the cases $x = y$ and $u = v$, which are settled by trichotomy, the order being total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] The canonical embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a field homomorphism, so $\iota(0) = 0$ and $\iota(n+1) = \iota(n) + 1$, and $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L6] Sign rules: a product of two positives is positive ([[lem-of-sign-rules]], claim 1), and a product of two nonnegatives is nonnegative, since a factor equal to $0$ makes the product $0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]) and otherwise both factors are positive; and $1 > 0$, which is proved in [[cor-of-one-positive]] and stated by none of the items named above.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 0$: every claim holds at $n = 0$, since both sides of claim 1 are $0 = 0 + 0$, both sides of claim 2 are $0 = \lambda \cdot 0$ and $0 = \iota(0)\lambda$, claim 4 reads $0 \le 0$ with no term to bound and the hypothesis $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ giving nothing to prove, claim 5 reads $0 = c_0 - c_0$, and claim 6 reads $1 = 1 \cdot 1$ with $1 > 0$. [base, L1, L2, L5, L6]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for this $n$ and for all sequences $a, b, c$ and all $\lambda$. [ih]

1.3 Splitting, claim 3, by a separate induction on the number of trailing terms $d = n - m$ with $m$ fixed: for $d = 0$ the claim reads $\sum_{k<m} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + 0$ and $\prod_{k<m} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\big) \cdot 1$, which hold; and if $\sum_{k<m+d} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d} a_{m+j}$, then $\sum_{k<m+d+1} a_k = \sum_{k<m+d} a_k + a_{m+d} = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \big(\sum_{j<d} a_{m+j} + a_{m+d}\big) = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d+1} a_{m+j}$ by associativity, and identically for products with $1$ in place of $0$ and multiplication in place of addition, so induction on $d$ gives claim 3 for every $m \le n$. [L1, L2, L3]

2.1 Additivity at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k\big) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) + \big(\sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n\big) = \sum_{k<n+1} a_k + \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$, using the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of addition. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Scaling at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda a_k = \sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda\big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) = \lambda \sum_{k<n+1} a_k$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and distributivity; taking $a_k = 1$ for all $k$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda = \sum_{k<n} \lambda + \lambda = \iota(n)\lambda + \lambda = (\iota(n) + 1)\lambda = \iota(n+1)\lambda$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L5]

2.3 Monotonicity at $n+1$: assume $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n+1$; then $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$, so the hypothesis gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$, and adding the inequality $a_n \le b_n$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n \le \sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n = \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$. [step 1.2, L1, L4]

2.4 Telescoping at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(c_{k+1} - c_k) = \sum_{k<n}(c_{k+1} - c_k) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = (c_n - c_0) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = c_{n+1} - c_0$, by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and the field identities. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.5 Products at $n+1$: $\prod_{k<n+1}(a_k b_k) = \big(\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k)\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n+1} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n+1} b_k\big)$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of multiplication; and if every $a_k \ge 0$ for $k < n+1$ then $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) a_n$ is a product of two nonnegatives, hence nonnegative, with the same argument giving positivity from positivity since $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1 > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L6]

3.1 Consequences of monotonicity, completing claim 4: monotonicity itself holds at every $n$, by the induction principle applied to the base case of step 1.1 and the successor step 2.3, so it is available for an arbitrary $n$ in what follows; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then comparing with the zero sequence gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge \sum_{k<n} 0 = 0$; for $j < n$ splitting at $j$ and then at $j+1$ writes $\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<j} a_k + a_j + \sum_{k=j+1}^{n-1} a_k$ with the first and third summands $\ge 0$, so $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$; and if moreover $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ then $0 \le a_j \le 0$ for every $j < n$, so $a_j = 0$. [step 1.1, step 2.3, step 1.3, L3, L4, L2]

4.1 By the induction principle claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and claim 3 was proved in step 1.3 with its consequences in step 3.1, so all six laws hold. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, step 2.5, step 1.3, step 3.1, L3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfy

$$m \;\le\; f(x) \;\le\; M \qquad \text{for every } x \in [a,b],$$

with $m, M$ real. Then $f$ is bounded ([[def-bounded-set]]), so its Darboux sums
and integrals are defined ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-darboux-integral]]), and
for **every** partition $P$ of $[a,b]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]])

$$m(b-a) \;\le\; L(f,P) \;\le\; \underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; U(f,P) \;\le\; M(b-a) .$$

In particular, taking $f$ to be the constant function with value $c$:

$$\int_a^b c \;=\; c\,(b-a) ,$$

the constant function being integrable, with $L(f,P) = U(f,P) = c(b-a)$ for
every partition $P$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, reals $m \le M$, and $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ with $m \le f(x) \le M$ for every $x \in [a,b]$. Let $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$, with subintervals $I_i$ and lengths $\Delta_i$ for $i < n$.

[L1] $\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = b - a$, every $\Delta_i > 0$, and $n \ge 1$; each $I_i$ is a nonempty subset of $[a,b]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-interval]]).

[L2] $m_i = \inf f[I_i]$ and $M_i = \sup f[I_i]$ exist, $L(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}m_i\Delta_i$ and $U(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}M_i\Delta_i$, and $m_i \le f(x) \le M_i$ for $x \in I_i$ ([[def-darboux-sums]]).

[L3] $L(f,P) \le \underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,P)$ for every partition $P$; $f$ is integrable exactly when the two integrals are equal, and then $\int_a^b f$ is their common value ([[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L4] An infimum is the greatest lower bound and a supremum the least upper bound; a set with a single element has that element as both ([[def-infimum]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L5] Finite sums: scaling, monotonicity in the terms, and $\sum_{i<n}\lambda\,\Delta_i = \lambda\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L6] Ordered-field arithmetic: multiplying an inequality by a positive quantity preserves it, adding a constant preserves it, and the order is transitive; $|x| \le \max\{|m|,|M|\}$ whenever $m \le x \le M$ ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $f$ is bounded: $|f(x)| \le \max\{|m|,|M|\}$ for every $x \in [a,b]$ by [L6], so the Darboux sums and integrals of [L2] and [L3] are defined. [given, L6]

1.2 For every $i < n$: $m$ is a lower bound of $f[I_i]$ and $M$ an upper bound, since $I_i \subseteq [a,b]$; the set $f[I_i]$ is nonempty by [L1]. Hence $m \le m_i$ and $M_i \le M$ by [L4]. [given, L1, L2, L4]

1.3 **The constant case, treated on its own.** Suppose in addition that $f$ is the constant function with value $c$, that is $f(x) = c$ for every $x \in [a,b]$; the general argument below does not use this supposition. Then $f[I_i] = \{c\}$ for every $i < n$ by [L1], so $m_i = M_i = c$ by [L4], and $L(f,P) = U(f,P) = \sum_{i<n} c\,\Delta_i = c(b-a)$ by [L5] and [L1]. [L1, L2, L4, L5]

2.1 $L(f,P) \ge m(b-a)$: by step 1.2 and $\Delta_i > 0$ one has $m_i\Delta_i \ge m\Delta_i$ for every $i < n$, so monotonicity and scaling in [L5] give $L(f,P) \ge \sum_{i<n} m\,\Delta_i = m\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = m(b-a)$ by [L1]. [step 1.2, L1, L5, L6]

2.2 $U(f,P) \le M(b-a)$: the same argument with $M_i \le M$ gives $U(f,P) \le \sum_{i<n}M\,\Delta_i = M(b-a)$. [step 1.2, L1, L5, L6]

3.1 Combining steps 2.1 and 2.2 with the chain of [L3] gives the displayed five-term inequality for every partition $P$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L3]

4.1 Hence, still under the supposition of step 1.3 that $f$ is constant with value $c$, the set of lower sums and the set of upper sums are both $\{c(b-a)\}$, so $\underline{\int_a^b} f = \overline{\int_a^b} f = c(b-a)$ by [L4], $f$ is integrable, and $\int_a^b c = c(b-a)$ by [L3]. [step 1.3, L3, L4] ∎

## Remarks

- **The five-term chain is the only estimate most of this page needs.** Every integrability proof below produces one partition and controls $U(f,P) - L(f,P)$; the chain then locates both integrals inside an interval of that length, and [[thm-riemann-criterion]] turns the observation into an equivalence.

- **The bounds are sharp, but equality does not characterize constants.** Constant functions show that neither outer coefficient can be improved. Nonconstant functions can also attain equality: for the Dirichlet indicator on $[0,1]$, every partition has $L(f,P) = 0$ and $U(f,P) = 1$, so both outer bounds are equalities.

- **Nonnegativity, as a special case.** If $f \ge 0$ on $[a,b]$ then $m$ may be taken to be $0$, so $\int_a^b f \ge 0$ whenever the integral exists. A nonnegative integrand with vanishing integral need not vanish, however; that is [[fs-nonnegative-integrable-with-zero-integral-vanishes]].

## Statement

Let $a < c < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]). Then:

1. $f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ ([[def-darboux-integral]]) **if and only if** its
   restrictions to $[a,c]$ and to $[c,b]$ are integrable;
2. and in that case
   $$\int_a^b f \;=\; \int_a^c f \;+\; \int_c^b f .$$
3. **Oriented form.** Let $\alpha < \beta$ be reals, let $f : [\alpha,\beta] \to
   \mathbb{R}$ be integrable, and let $u, v, w \in [\alpha,\beta]$ be arbitrary.
   Then, with the convention of [[def-oriented-integral]],
   $$\int_u^v f \;+\; \int_v^w f \;=\; \int_u^w f .$$

Claim 3 is where [[def-oriented-integral]] earns its place: it holds for every
arrangement of the three points, including the degenerate ones, and it is the
form used everywhere below.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < c < b$ and a bounded $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$; and, for claim 3, reals $\alpha < \beta$, an integrable $f : [\alpha,\beta] \to \mathbb{R}$ and points $u,v,w \in [\alpha,\beta]$. Let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given.

[L1] Riemann's criterion on any closed bounded interval with distinct endpoints ([[thm-riemann-criterion]]).

[L2] A function integrable on $[p,q]$ is integrable on every $[p',q'] \subseteq [p,q]$ with $p' < q'$ ([[lem-integrability-on-a-subinterval]]).

[L3] For a partition $R = (n,t)$ and bounded $h$: $L(h,R) = \sum_{i<n}m_i\Delta_i$, $U(h,R) = \sum_{i<n}M_i\Delta_i$, and $L(h,R) \le \underline{\int} h \le \overline{\int} h \le U(h,R)$, the integral being the common value of the two when they agree ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L4] A partition of $[p,q]$ is a pair $(n,t)$ with $n \ge 1$, $t_0 = p$, $t_i < t_{i+1}$ for $i < n$ and $t_k = q$ for $k \ge n$; its subintervals are $[t_i,t_{i+1}]$ for $i<n$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-interval]]).

[L5] Finite sums split at an intermediate index, with $\sum_{k=p}^{q-1}x_k = \sum_{j<q-p}x_{p+j}$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], clause 3).

[L6] With oriented limits, $\int_v^u h = -\int_u^v h$ and $\int_u^u h = 0$ ([[def-oriented-integral]]).

[L7] Ordered-field arithmetic: adding a constant preserves an inequality, the order is total and transitive, and a real of absolute value below every positive real is $0$ ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Claim 1, forward.** If $f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ then, since $a < c$ and $c < b$, [L2] gives integrability on $[a,c]$ and on $[c,b]$. [L2]

1.2 **The splice.** Let $P_1 = (n_1,t^1)$ be a partition of $[a,c]$ and $P_2 = (n_2,t^2)$ one of $[c,b]$. Define $P := (n_1+n_2,\ t)$ by $t_i := t^1_i$ for $i \le n_1$, $t_{n_1+j} := t^2_j$ for $j \le n_2$, and $t_k := b$ for $k \ge n_1+n_2$. The two prescriptions agree at $i = n_1$, where $t^1_{n_1} = c = t^2_0$; and $t_0 = a$, $t_{n_1+n_2} = t^2_{n_2} = b$, with $t_i < t_{i+1}$ for every $i < n_1+n_2$. So $P$ is a partition of $[a,b]$. [L4, construct]

1.3 **Claim 1, converse.** Suppose $f$ is integrable on $[a,c]$ and on $[c,b]$, and use [L1] on each to fix $P_1$ with $U(f,P_1)-L(f,P_1) < \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1}$ and $P_2$ with $U(f,P_2)-L(f,P_2) < \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1}$. [L1, choose]

2.1 The first $n_1$ subintervals of $P$ are those of $P_1$ and the last $n_2$ are those of $P_2$, with the matching lengths, so by [L3] and the splitting law [L5], $L(f,P) = L(f,P_1) + L(f,P_2)$ and $U(f,P) = U(f,P_1) + U(f,P_2)$. [step 1.2, L3, L4, L5]

3.1 For the splice $P$ of those two, step 2.1 gives $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$; as $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary and $f$ is bounded, [L1] makes $f$ integrable on $[a,b]$. [step 1.2, step 2.1, step 1.3, L1, L7]

4.1 **Claim 2.** With $P_1$, $P_2$ and $P$ as above, [L3] puts $\int_a^b f$ between $L(f,P)$ and $U(f,P)$, that is between $L(f,P_1)+L(f,P_2)$ and $U(f,P_1)+U(f,P_2)$ by step 2.1; and [L3] applied on $[a,c]$ and on $[c,b]$ puts $\int_a^c f + \int_c^b f$ between the same two numbers. [step 2.1, step 1.3, step 3.1, L3]

5.1 Those two numbers differ by less than $\varepsilon$ by step 1.3, so $\bigl|\int_a^b f - \int_a^c f - \int_c^b f\bigr| < \varepsilon$; as $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary the difference is $0$, which is claim 2. [step 1.3, step 4.1, L7]

6.1 **Claim 3, first the sorted case.** Let $x \le y$ in $[\alpha,\beta]$. Then $\int_\alpha^y f = \int_\alpha^x f + \int_x^y f$. Indeed if $\alpha < x < y$ this is claim 2 applied on $[\alpha,y]$, where $f$ is integrable by [L2]; if $x = \alpha$ the middle term is $0$ by [L6] and the identity is trivial; and if $x = y$ the last term is $0$ by [L6] and the identity is again trivial. [step 5.1, L2, L6]

7.1 Put $F(x) := \int_\alpha^x f$ for $x \in [\alpha,\beta]$, which is defined by [L2] and [L6]. Then $\int_x^y f = F(y) - F(x)$ for **all** $x,y \in [\alpha,\beta]$: for $x < y$ this is step 6.1 rearranged; for $x = y$ both sides are $0$ by [L6]; and for $x > y$ the case already proved gives $\int_y^x f = F(x)-F(y)$, and [L6] negates both sides. [step 6.1, L2, L6, construct]

8.1 **Claim 3.** For arbitrary $u,v,w \in [\alpha,\beta]$, step 7.1 gives $\int_u^v f + \int_v^w f = \bigl(F(v)-F(u)\bigr) + \bigl(F(w)-F(v)\bigr) = F(w)-F(u) = \int_u^w f$. [step 7.1, algebra] ∎

## Remarks

- **The oriented form is not proved by listing six orderings.** Step 7.1 shows that the oriented integral between two points is a *difference of values of one function of one variable*, after which claim 3 is the cancellation $(F(v)-F(u))+(F(w)-F(v)) = F(w)-F(u)$, valid however the three points are arranged and however many of them coincide. The case analysis is confined to the two lines of step 7.1, and no appeal to symmetry is made anywhere.

- **The function $F$ of step 7.1 is the integral function**, and it is given its own item, [[def-the-integral-function]], because the rest of the page is about it. Nothing there re-proves step 7.1; it cites this theorem.

- **Boundedness on the whole of $[a,b]$ is a hypothesis of claim 1 in both directions.** Boundedness on $[a,c]$ and on $[c,b]$ separately does give boundedness on the union, so the converse could be stated with the hypothesis split; it is stated globally because [[def-darboux-sums]] needs it globally to make $U(f,P)$ meaningful for a partition of $[a,b]$.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be monotone, that is
nondecreasing or nonincreasing on $[a,b]$ ([[def-monotone-function]]). Then $f$
is bounded ([[def-bounded-set]]) and Riemann integrable on $[a,b]$
([[def-darboux-integral]]).

Moreover, for the uniform partition $U_N$ of $[a,b]$ into $N \ge 1$ parts
([[def-partition-and-refinement]]),

$$U(f,U_N) - L(f,U_N) \;=\; \bigl|f(b) - f(a)\bigr| \cdot \frac{b-a}{\iota(N)} ,$$

where $\iota(N)$ is the canonical natural of $N$ in $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-canonical-natural]]). The right-hand side is an **equality**, not an
estimate: the sum $\sum_{i<N}(M_i - m_i)$ telescopes exactly, because on each
subinterval a monotone function attains its extremes at the two endpoints.

No continuity is assumed, and none holds in general: a nondecreasing function may
be discontinuous at every rational
([[thm-monotone-with-prescribed-discontinuity-set]]), and the companion page of
this pair works out the integral of the floor function, the simplest
discontinuous monotone integrand.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and a monotone $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$. Let $N \ge 1$ be a natural number and let $U_N = (N,t)$ be the uniform partition of $[a,b]$ into $N$ parts, with subintervals $I_i = [t_i,t_{i+1}]$ and lengths $\Delta_i = (b-a)/\iota(N)$ for $i < N$.

[L1] $f$ is nondecreasing, meaning $f(x) \le f(y)$ whenever $x \le y$ in $[a,b]$, or nonincreasing, meaning $f(x) \ge f(y)$ whenever $x \le y$; these two cases are what "monotone" means and they exhaust it ([[def-monotone-function]]).

[L2] For the uniform partition: $t_0 = a$, $t_N = b$, $t_i < t_{i+1}$, every $\Delta_i = (b-a)/\iota(N) > 0$, and $\sum_{i<N}\Delta_i = b-a$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L3] If a nonempty set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ has a greatest element then that element is $\sup S$, and if it has a least element then that element is $\inf S$ ([[def-max-min]], [[def-infimum]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L4] $M_i = \sup f[I_i]$, $m_i = \inf f[I_i]$, $U(f,P) - L(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}(M_i-m_i)\Delta_i$ ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L5] Finite sums: scaling and telescoping, $\sum_{i<N}(c_{i+1}-c_i) = c_N - c_0$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L6] Riemann's criterion: a bounded $f$ is integrable if and only if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a partition $P$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$ ([[thm-riemann-criterion]]).

[L7] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N) < \eta$, and $\iota(N) > 0$ for $N \ge 1$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L8] Ordered-field arithmetic and the absolute value: adding a constant and multiplying by a positive quantity preserve an inequality; the order is total and transitive; $|x| = x$ for $x \ge 0$ and $|x| = -x$ for $x \le 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-interval]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 By [L1] there are two cases, $f$ nondecreasing and $f$ nonincreasing, and they exhaust the hypothesis. Every $x \in [a,b]$ satisfies $a \le x \le b$ ([[def-interval]]). [given, L1, cases]

1.2 **Case: $f$ is nondecreasing.** Then $f(a) \le f(x) \le f(b)$ for every $x \in [a,b]$, so $f$ is bounded by [L8]; and for $i < N$ and $x \in I_i$ one has $t_i \le x \le t_{i+1}$, hence $f(t_i) \le f(x) \le f(t_{i+1})$. Since $f(t_i)$ and $f(t_{i+1})$ themselves lie in $f[I_i]$, they are its least and greatest elements, so $m_i = f(t_i)$ and $M_i = f(t_{i+1})$ by [L3]. [assume-case up, given, L2, L3, L8]

1.3 **Case: $f$ is nonincreasing.** Then $f(b) \le f(x) \le f(a)$ for every $x \in [a,b]$, so $f$ is bounded; and for $i < N$ and $x \in I_i$ one has $f(t_{i+1}) \le f(x) \le f(t_i)$, so $m_i = f(t_{i+1})$ and $M_i = f(t_i)$ by [L3]. [assume-case down, given, L2, L3, L8]

2.1 In the nondecreasing case, $M_i - m_i = f(t_{i+1}) - f(t_i)$, so by [L4], [L2] and [L5], $U(f,U_N) - L(f,U_N) = \sum_{i<N}\bigl(f(t_{i+1}) - f(t_i)\bigr)\frac{b-a}{\iota(N)} = \frac{b-a}{\iota(N)}\bigl(f(t_N) - f(t_0)\bigr) = \frac{b-a}{\iota(N)}\bigl(f(b) - f(a)\bigr)$, and $f(b) - f(a) \ge 0$, so this equals $|f(b)-f(a)|(b-a)/\iota(N)$ by [L8].

2.2 In the nonincreasing case the same computation gives $U(f,U_N) - L(f,U_N) = \frac{b-a}{\iota(N)}\bigl(f(a) - f(b)\bigr)$ with $f(a) - f(b) \ge 0$, which is again $|f(b)-f(a)|(b-a)/\iota(N)$ by [L8]. The two cases of step 1.1 exhaust the hypothesis, so the displayed identity holds for every monotone $f$, which is also bounded. [step 1.3, L2, L4, L5, L8, cases-exhaustive]

3.1 Let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given and put $\eta := \varepsilon \cdot \bigl((|f(b)-f(a)| + 1)(b-a)\bigr)^{-1}$, a positive real by [L8]. By [L7] fix a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N) < \eta$. [step 2.2, L7, L8, choose]

4.1 Then $U(f,U_N) - L(f,U_N) = |f(b)-f(a)|\,(b-a)/\iota(N) \le (|f(b)-f(a)|+1)(b-a)/\iota(N) < (|f(b)-f(a)|+1)(b-a)\,\eta = \varepsilon$: the first inequality because $(b-a)/\iota(N) > 0$ and $|f(b)-f(a)| \le |f(b)-f(a)|+1$, and the second because $(|f(b)-f(a)|+1)(b-a) > 0$ and $1/\iota(N) < \eta$. So $U(f,U_N) - L(f,U_N) < \varepsilon$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, L8]

5.1 Since the real $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary and step 4.1 produced a partition with $U - L < \varepsilon$, criterion [L6] applies: $f$ is bounded by steps 1.2 and 1.3 and Riemann integrable on $[a,b]$. [step 1.2, step 1.3, step 4.1, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- **The telescoping is exact, and that is what makes the proof short.** No estimate of $M_i - m_i$ is needed subinterval by subinterval: the whole sum of the gaps is the total rise of $f$, however wildly the rise is distributed. This is why a monotone function with infinitely many jumps is no harder than a continuous one here, and it is the same telescoping that [[def-partition-and-refinement]] uses for the lengths.

- **Uniformity of the partition is a convenience, not a necessity.** For an arbitrary partition $P$ the same identification of $m_i$ and $M_i$ gives $U(f,P) - L(f,P) \le \|P\| \cdot |f(b)-f(a)|$, by bounding each $\Delta_i$ by the mesh before telescoping. The uniform partition is used above only so that $\Delta_i$ can be pulled out of the sum as a constant.

- **No choice principle is used.** The partition is given by a formula in $N$, and $N$ is obtained from one instance of the Archimedean property. See [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].

- **Monotone is strictly weaker than continuous here.** The floor function is nondecreasing with jumps at every integer and is integrable (the companion page of this pair); and a monotone function has at most countably many discontinuities ([[thm-froda]]), so this theorem is also a special case of [[cor-countably-many-discontinuities-integrable]] once that is available. The direct proof is kept because it is elementary and quantitative, and because it costs no choice at all.
