an independent adversarial proof-refuter. Return evidence only; Audit-Alpha
alone adjudicates and edits.

## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` Statement or counterexample, actively search for a
counterexample to the public claim or a failure in the witness. A false public
claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or materially
inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is nonfatal.

Return no more than 450 words, exactly in this shape:

## Statement

Let $c < d$ be reals and let $\varphi : [c,d] \to \mathbb{R}$ be differentiable
at every point of $[c,d]$ as a function on $[c,d]$ ([[def-derivative]]), with
$\varphi'$ integrable on $[c,d]$ ([[def-darboux-integral]]). Let
$J \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be order-convex with at least two elements
([[def-interval]]) with $\varphi[\,[c,d]\,] \subseteq J$, and let $f : J \to
\mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $J$ ([[def-continuity-real]]).

Then $(f\circ\varphi)\,\varphi'$ is integrable on $[c,d]$ and

$$\int_{\varphi(c)}^{\varphi(d)} f \;=\; \int_c^d (f\circ\varphi)\,\varphi' ,$$

the left-hand integral being the oriented one of [[def-oriented-integral]].

**Neither injectivity nor monotonicity of $\varphi$ is assumed**, and that is
exactly why the left-hand side is written with oriented limits: $\varphi(d)$ may
lie below $\varphi(c)$, and $\varphi$ may return to the same value many times.
The proof runs through a primitive of $f$ and the chain rule, and no inverse
function is ever formed.

**Continuity of $f$ is a hypothesis and cannot be weakened to integrability.**
With $f$ merely integrable the composite $f \circ \varphi$ need not be
integrable at all, so the right-hand side need not exist; that is
the false statement that weakens it on the companion page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $c < d$, a differentiable $\varphi : [c,d] \to \mathbb{R}$ with $\varphi'$ integrable, an order-convex $J$ with at least two elements containing $\varphi[\,[c,d]\,]$, and a continuous $f : J \to \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] A function differentiable at every point of $[c,d]$ is continuous there, and a continuous function on $[c,d]$ is integrable ([[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]], [[thm-continuous-implies-integrable]], [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L2] For a continuous $u$ on $[c,d]$ with $c \le d$, $u[\,[c,d]\,] = [m,M]$ with $m = \min u[\,[c,d]\,]$ and $M = \max u[\,[c,d]\,]$ ([[cor-continuous-image-of-an-interval-is-an-interval]], claim 2, [[def-max-min]]).

[L3] A continuous function on an order-convex set with at least two elements has a primitive there, two primitives differ by a constant, and $\int_p^q f = G(q)-G(p)$ for $p<q$ in that set and any primitive $G$ ([[cor-primitives-of-a-continuous-function]]).

[L4] Chain rule: if $\psi$ is differentiable at $t$, $\psi(t)$ is a limit point of the domain of $H$ and $H$ is differentiable at $\psi(t)$, then $H\circ\psi$ is differentiable at $t$ with $(H\circ\psi)'(t) = H'(\psi(t))\psi'(t)$; every point of a nondegenerate order-convex set is a limit point of it ([[thm-chain-rule]], [[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-interval]], [[def-derivative]]).

[L5] If $w$ is integrable on $[c,d]$ with values in $[m,M]$ and $g$ is continuous on $[m,M]$ then $g\circ w$ is integrable ([[thm-composition-with-a-continuous-function]]); a restriction of a continuous function is continuous ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L6] A product of two integrable functions on $[c,d]$ is integrable ([[cor-integrability-of-absolute-values-products-and-lattice-operations]], claim 1).

[L7] If $H$ is differentiable at every point of $[c,d]$ with $H'$ integrable there, then $\int_c^d H' = H(d)-H(c)$ ([[thm-ftc-second-part]]).

[L8] With oriented limits, $\int_q^p f = -\int_p^q f$ and $\int_p^p f = 0$ ([[def-oriented-integral]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $\varphi$ is continuous on $[c,d]$ and integrable there by [L1]. [given, L1]

1.2 By [L3] fix a primitive $F : J \to \mathbb{R}$ of $f$, so $F$ is differentiable at every point of $J$ with $F' = f$ there. [given, L3, choose]

2.1 By [L2], $\varphi[\,[c,d]\,] = [m,M]$ with $m \le M$, and $[m,M] \subseteq J$ by hypothesis. [step 1.1, given, L2]

2.2 **The left-hand side is the same increment.** If $\varphi(c) < \varphi(d)$ then both lie in $J$, so $[\varphi(c),\varphi(d)] \subseteq J$ and [L3] gives $\int_{\varphi(c)}^{\varphi(d)} f = F(\varphi(d))-F(\varphi(c))$. If $\varphi(c) = \varphi(d)$ both sides are $0$ by [L8]. If $\varphi(c) > \varphi(d)$ then the case already treated gives $\int_{\varphi(d)}^{\varphi(c)} f = F(\varphi(c))-F(\varphi(d))$, and [L8] negates both sides. [step 1.2, L3, L8]

3.1 For every $t \in [c,d]$ the point $\varphi(t)$ lies in $J$, which is a nondegenerate order-convex set, so $\varphi(t)$ is a limit point of $J$ and [L4] applies: $F\circ\varphi$ is differentiable at $t$ with $(F\circ\varphi)'(t) = F'(\varphi(t))\varphi'(t) = f(\varphi(t))\,\varphi'(t)$. [step 2.1, step 1.2, given, L4]

3.2 $f$ restricted to $[m,M]$ is continuous, so by [L5] applied to $w := \varphi$ the composite $f\circ\varphi$ is integrable on $[c,d]$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, given, L5]

4.1 Hence $(f\circ\varphi)\varphi'$ is integrable on $[c,d]$ by [L6], $\varphi'$ being integrable by hypothesis. [step 3.2, given, L6]

5.1 By [L7] applied to $H := F\circ\varphi$, whose derivative is $(f\circ\varphi)\varphi'$ by step 3.1 and is integrable by step 4.1, $\int_c^d (f\circ\varphi)\varphi' = F(\varphi(d)) - F(\varphi(c))$. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L7]

6.1 Comparing steps 5.1 and 2.2 gives $\int_{\varphi(c)}^{\varphi(d)} f = \int_c^d (f\circ\varphi)\varphi'$. [step 5.1, step 2.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **[[def-oriented-integral]] is what makes step 2.2 legal.** Without the orientation convention the symbol $\int_{\varphi(c)}^{\varphi(d)} f$ would be undefined whenever $\varphi(d) \le \varphi(c)$, and the theorem would have to carry a monotonicity hypothesis it does not need.

- **Two integrability facts are checked, not assumed.** That $f\circ\varphi$ is integrable is [[thm-composition-with-a-continuous-function]] with the hypotheses in the order that theorem requires — the continuous function is the outer one — and that the product with $\varphi'$ is integrable is the product clause of [[cor-integrability-of-absolute-values-products-and-lattice-operations]]. Neither is automatic, and the companion page's false statement is exactly the claim that the first of them survives weakening $f$ to an integrable function.

- **Where the more familiar hypotheses sit.** If $\varphi$ is continuously differentiable then $\varphi'$ is integrable automatically, and if $\varphi$ is in addition strictly monotone then the substitution can be read in either direction; neither refinement is needed above, and neither is claimed.

- **Forward reference, orientation only.** The false statement that weakens the continuity of $f$ to integrability is [[fs-substitution-holds-for-every-integrable-integrand]] on the companion page; nothing above depends on it.

Then **every** $f : A \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$: take\n   $\\delta := \\eta$, so that the only $x \\in A$ with $|x - c| < \\delta$ is $c$\n   itself, and $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \\varepsilon$.\n\n3. **On a set.** Continuity on $A$ is continuity at each point of $A$, and\n   nothing more. It is not a condition relating $f$ to points outside $A$.\n\nEvery point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$,\nand never both ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so clauses 1 and 2 between them describe\ncontinuity at every point of $A$.\n\n**This is not the raw $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ formula of\n[[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]].** That item records what goes\nwrong when the *punctured* formula of [[def-function-limit]] is written down at\nan arbitrary point of the domain: at an isolated point it is satisfied\nvacuously by every real $L$ at once, so it defines nothing, and this library\ntherefore leaves $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x)$ **undefined** at an isolated point.\nContinuity at an isolated point is a different matter: the formula above is not\nvacuous — it is a genuine condition on $f(c)$, satisfied because $f(c)$ is the\nonly value being compared with itself — and it names a single, well-defined\nproperty. The limit is undefined there; the continuity is defined, and is\nautomatic. Clause 1 is the only place where the two notions meet, and it is\nstated only where the limit exists as a notion.\n\n**Where the distinction disappears.** If $A$ is an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}$\n([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), then every $c \\in A$ has some\n$N_{\\eta}(c) \\subseteq A$, and a punctured neighbourhood is never empty\n([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), so every point of $A$ is a limit point of $A$ and\nclause 1 covers the whole of $A$.

Two reals both meeting the condition are therefore equal, and the\n   symbol denotes.\n2. **Meaningfulness.** The hypothesis that $c$ is a limit point of $A$ is not\n   decoration.

The clause $0 < |x - c|$ removes $x = c$ from both\nquantifiers, so in both cases the points quantified over are exactly the\n$x \\in A \\setminus \\{c\\}$ with $0 < |x - c| < \\delta$, at which $Q$ and\n$q_{f,c}$ take the same value. The two conditions are the same condition.\n\n**Differentiability on a set.** For $S \\subseteq A$, $f$ is **differentiable on\n$S$** when it is differentiable at every $c \\in S$; implicit in that phrase is\nthat every point of $S$ is a limit point of $A$. $f$ is **differentiable** when\nit is differentiable on the whole of $A$.\n\n**Restriction of the domain.** Let $B \\subseteq A$, let $c \\in B$ and suppose\n$c$ is a limit point of $B$.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $A$
([[def-continuity-real]]) and let $I \subseteq A$ be order-convex
([[def-interval]]). Then:

1. $f[I]$ is order-convex, hence connected
   ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]], [[def-connected-r]]);
2. if $I = [a,b]$ with $a \le b$, then $f[I] = [m, M]$ where
   $m = \min f[I]$ and $M = \max f[I]$ ([[def-max-min]]) — a **closed bounded
   interval**, degenerate exactly when $f$ is constant on $[a,b]$.

**"Interval" means "order-convex" here.** As [[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]]
records, this library proves that the connected subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ are
exactly the order-convex ones, and does **not** prove that every order-convex
subset is one of the nine written forms of [[def-interval]]. Claim 1 is
therefore stated as order-convexity, which is what the intermediate value
theorem delivers; claim 2 identifies the written form in the one case where the
extreme value theorem supplies the endpoints.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ continuous on $A$, and an order-convex set $I \subseteq A$.

[L1] Intermediate value theorem: if $u \le v$ in $\mathbb{R}$, if $f$ is continuous on $[u,v]$ and if $w$ lies between $f(u)$ and $f(v)$ in either order, then $f(t) = w$ for some $t \in [u,v]$ ([[thm-intermediate-value]]).

[L2] Continuity passes to subsets of the domain: if $B \subseteq A$ then $f|_B$ is continuous on $B$, since the defining condition quantifies over fewer points ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L3] Order-convexity: $x, z \in S$ and $x \le w \le z$ imply $w \in S$; every closed bounded interval $[u,v]$ with $u \le v$ is order-convex and is a subset of any order-convex set containing $u$ and $v$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L4] Connectedness: a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is connected if and only if it is order-convex ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]], [[def-connected-r]]).

[L5] $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$ is nonempty, closed and bounded ([[def-interval]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-bounded-set]]), hence compact ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L6] Extreme value theorem: a continuous real function on a nonempty compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ attains a greatest and a least value on it ([[thm-extreme-value-r]], [[def-max-min]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Claim 1.** Let $u', v' \in f[I]$ and let $w$ satisfy $u' \le w \le v'$. Write $u' = f(p)$ and $v' = f(q)$ with $p, q \in I$, and let $[s,t]$ be the closed bounded interval with $\{s,t\} = \{p,q\}$ and $s \le t$; by [L3] and order-convexity of $I$ we have $[s,t] \subseteq I \subseteq A$. [L3, choose]

1.2 **Claim 2, the endpoints.** Suppose $I = [a,b]$ with $a \le b$. By [L5] the set $[a,b]$ is nonempty and compact, so by [L6] there are $q, p \in [a,b]$ with $f(q) \le f(x) \le f(p)$ for every $x \in [a,b]$; put $m := f(q)$ and $M := f(p)$, so $m = \min f[I]$ and $M = \max f[I]$ and $m \le M$. [L5, L6, choose]

2.1 By [L2] the restriction of $f$ to $[s,t]$ is continuous on $[s,t]$, and $w$ lies between $f(s)$ and $f(t)$ in one order or the other, since $\{f(s), f(t)\} = \{u', v'\}$ and $u' \le w \le v'$. By [L1] there is $c \in [s,t] \subseteq I$ with $f(c) = w$, so $w \in f[I]$. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

3.1 So $f[I]$ is order-convex, and by [L4] it is connected. This is claim 1. [step 2.1, L4]

4.1 **Claim 2, the two inclusions.** Every $z \in f[I]$ satisfies $m \le z \le M$ by step 1.2, so $f[I] \subseteq [m,M]$. Conversely, $m$ and $M$ lie in $f[I]$ and $f[I]$ is order-convex by step 3.1, so every $w$ with $m \le w \le M$ lies in $f[I]$; hence $[m,M] \subseteq f[I]$. Therefore $f[I] = [m,M]$, a closed bounded interval, and it is the single point $\{m\}$ exactly when $m = M$, that is exactly when $f$ is constant on $[a,b]$. [step 3.1, step 1.2, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **The two halves come from the two theorems.** Order-convexity of the image is the intermediate value theorem and needs nothing else; that the image of a *closed bounded* interval is again closed and bounded is the extreme value theorem, and it fails for other interval forms: the continuous image of $(0,1)$ under $x \mapsto 1/x$ is $(1,\infty)$, and under $x \mapsto x$ it is $(0,1)$, neither closed.

- **The converse of claim 1 is false.** A function whose image on every subinterval is order-convex need not be continuous; this is the intermediate value property without continuity, and the witness for it is not available at this point in the reading order. What *is* true, and is proved on this page, is that a function which is monotone and has an order-convex image is continuous ([[lem-monotone-with-interval-image-is-continuous]]).

- **Claim 2 is the shape the $n$-th-root example uses.** Applying it to $x \mapsto x^{n}$ on $[0, a+1]$ gives an interval containing $0$ and $(a+1)^{n} \ge a$, hence containing $a$; that is the second proof of the existence of $n$-th roots recorded in [[ex-ivt-gives-nth-roots]] on the companion page.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$ be a
limit point of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]). If $f$ is differentiable at $c$
([[def-derivative]]) then $f$ is continuous at $c$ ([[def-continuity-real]]).

Consequently, if $f$ is differentiable on a set $S \subseteq A$ then $f$ is
continuous at every point of $S$.

**No converse is asserted, and none holds.** Continuity at $c$ does not give
differentiability at $c$, and the standard witness is worked out on the
companion page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and a point $c \in A$ that is a limit point of $A$ at which $f$ is differentiable ([[def-derivative]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L1] Carathéodory's characterisation ([[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]]): since $f$ is differentiable at the limit point $c$ of $A$, there is $\varphi : A \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $c$, with $f(x) - f(c) = \varphi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in A$, and $\varphi(c) = f'(c)$.

[L2] Algebra of continuous functions ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]]): sums, scalar multiples and products of functions continuous at a point of the common domain are continuous there (claim 1); and every constant function on $A$ and the identity $x \mapsto x$ on $A$ are continuous at every point of $A$ (claim 5).

[L3] Continuity of $f$ at $c$ is the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ condition of [[def-continuity-real]], and continuity on a set is continuity at each of its points.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Fix a function $\varphi : A \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $c$, with $f(x) - f(c) = \varphi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in A$. [L1, choose]

1.2 The identity $x \mapsto x$ on $A$ and every constant function on $A$ are continuous at $c$; hence so is $x \mapsto x - c$, which is the sum of the identity and the constant function with value $-c$. [L2]

2.1 The pointwise product $x \mapsto \varphi(x)(x - c)$ is continuous at $c$, being the product of two functions on $A$ continuous at $c$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L2]

3.1 For every $x \in A$ one has $f(x) = f(c) + \varphi(x)(x - c)$, so $f$ is the sum of the constant function with value $f(c)$ and the product of step 2.1. [step 1.1, L1]

4.1 A sum of two functions continuous at $c$ is continuous at $c$, so $f$ is continuous at $c$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L2, L3]

5.1 The point $c$ was an arbitrary point of $A$, a limit point of $A$, at which $f$ is differentiable; applying step 4.1 at every point of a set $S \subseteq A$ on which $f$ is differentiable gives continuity of $f$ at every point of $S$. [step 3.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the work actually is.** None of it is here. Carathéodory's characterisation already replaces the quotient by a product, and a product is visibly small when one factor is bounded near $c$ and the other tends to $0$; the algebra of continuous functions packages exactly that. A direct proof from the quotient would multiply and divide by $x - c$ and would have to say why that is legal, which is the same observation in a less convenient place.

- **The converse fails.** $x \mapsto |x|$ is continuous at $0$ and not differentiable there, which is [[cex-absolute-value-is-not-differentiable-at-zero]] on the companion page. So continuity is strictly weaker, and the gap is not exotic: it opens at a single corner.

- **What is *not* claimed.** Nothing here says that a function differentiable on a set has a continuous derivative, and nothing here says that $f'$ is defined anywhere except where it was assumed to be. Both are separate questions, and neither is settled on this page.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]). Then:

1. $|f|$, $f^{2}$ and $fg$ are integrable on $[a,b]$
   ([[def-abs-value]], [[def-integer-power]]);
2. $\max(f,g)$ and $\min(f,g)$, defined pointwise
   ([[def-max-min]]), are integrable on $[a,b]$;
3. the **triangle inequality for the integral**:
   $$\Bigl|\int_a^b f\Bigr| \;\le\; \int_a^b |f| .$$

**Claim 3 is stated with $a < b$ and is not orientation-invariant.** For $u > v$
the right-hand side is $-\int_v^u |f| \le 0$ while the left-hand side is $\ge 0$,
so the inequality as written is false there. The form valid for *every* pair
$u,v$ on which $f$ is integrable ([[def-oriented-integral]]) is

$$\Bigl|\int_u^v f\Bigr| \;\le\; \Bigl|\int_u^v |f|\,\Bigr| ,$$

and that is the form the estimates below on this page use whenever the limits
are not known to be in increasing order.

**The converse of claim 1 fails.** Integrability of $|f|$ does not give
integrability of $f$; the witness is on the companion page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and integrable $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] If $u$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ with values in $[m,M]$ and $\varphi$ is continuous on $[m,M]$, then $\varphi\circ u$ is integrable ([[thm-composition-with-a-continuous-function]]); an integrable function is bounded, so such $m$ and $M$ exist ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-bounded-set]], [[def-interval]]).

[L2] Sums and scalar multiples of integrable functions are integrable, with $\int_a^b(\lambda u + \nu w) = \lambda\int_a^b u + \nu\int_a^b w$ ([[thm-linearity-of-the-integral]]).

[L3] If $u \le w$ pointwise on $[a,b]$ and both are integrable then $\int_a^b u \le \int_a^b w$ ([[thm-monotonicity-of-the-integral]]).

[L4] The absolute value $t \mapsto |t|$, the square $t \mapsto t^{2}$ and every polynomial function are continuous on every subset of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], claims 2 and 5, [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L5] For reals $s,t$: $\max\{s,t\} = (s + t + |s-t|)\cdot 2^{-1}$ and $\min\{s,t\} = (s + t - |s-t|)\cdot 2^{-1}$, and $st = \bigl((s+t)^{2} - (s-t)^{2}\bigr)\cdot 4^{-1}$ ([[def-max-min]], [[def-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L6] Absolute value: $-|t| \le t \le |t|$, and $|t| \le c$ follows from $-c \le t \le c$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]]).

[L7] With oriented limits, $\int_v^u u = -\int_u^v u$ and $\int_u^u u = 0$ ([[def-oriented-integral]]).

[L8] Ordered-field arithmetic: adding constants and multiplying by positive reals preserve inequalities, and the order is total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $f$ is bounded, so fix reals $m \le M$ with $f[\,[a,b]\,] \subseteq [m,M]$; the same for $g$, and for $f+g$ and $f-g$, which are integrable by [L2]. [given, L1, L2, choose]

1.2 The maps $t \mapsto |t|$ and $t \mapsto t^{2}$ are continuous on any closed bounded interval, by [L4]. [L4]

2.1 By [L1] applied with $\varphi(t) = |t|$ to $f$, to $g$ and to $f-g$, the functions $|f|$, $|g|$ and $|f-g|$ are integrable. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1]

2.2 By [L1] applied with $\varphi(t) = t^{2}$ to $f$, to $f+g$ and to $f-g$, the functions $f^{2}$, $(f+g)^{2}$ and $(f-g)^{2}$ are integrable. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1]

3.1 By [L5], $fg = \bigl((f+g)^{2}-(f-g)^{2}\bigr)\cdot 4^{-1}$ pointwise, so $fg$ is integrable by [L2]; this completes claim 1. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L2, L5]

3.2 By [L5], $\max(f,g) = \bigl(f + g + |f-g|\bigr)\cdot 2^{-1}$ and $\min(f,g) = \bigl(f+g-|f-g|\bigr)\cdot 2^{-1}$ pointwise, so both are integrable by [L2]; this is claim 2. [step 2.1, L2, L5]

3.3 **Claim 3.** By [L6], $-|f| \le f \le |f|$ pointwise on $[a,b]$, and all three functions are integrable by step 2.1 and [L2]. [step 2.1, L2, L6]

4.1 By [L3] applied twice, $-\int_a^b|f| \le \int_a^b f \le \int_a^b |f|$, using $\int_a^b(-|f|) = -\int_a^b|f|$ from [L2]. [step 3.3, L2, L3]

5.1 Hence $\bigl|\int_a^b f\bigr| \le \int_a^b|f|$ by [L6], which is claim 3. [step 4.1, L6]

6.1 **The oriented form.** For $u = v$ both sides are $0$ by [L7]; for $u < v$ it is claim 3 on $[u,v]$; and for $u > v$ both $\int_u^v f$ and $\int_u^v |f|$ are the negatives of the corresponding integrals over $[v,u]$ by [L7], so the two absolute values are unchanged and claim 3 on $[v,u]$ gives the inequality. [step 5.1, L7, L8] ∎

## Remarks

- **Every integrability clause comes from one theorem plus linearity.** The only input that produces integrability is [[thm-composition-with-a-continuous-function]], with [[thm-linearity-of-the-integral]] recombining the pieces; claim 3 additionally uses [[thm-monotonicity-of-the-integral]], which is the one place an inequality between integrals is needed. The identities of [L5] are algebra, and they are what turns a statement about composing with $|\cdot|$ and $(\cdot)^2$ into statements about products and lattice operations. In particular no new estimate on Darboux sums is made here.

- **The polarisation identity is used, and it is why $f^2$ comes first.** There is no direct route from integrability of $f$ and of $g$ to integrability of $fg$ through the composition theorem, because $(s,t) \mapsto st$ is a function of two variables and the theorem composes with one. Writing $fg$ through squares of sums and differences reduces it to the one-variable case.

- **The inequality of claim 3 is the integral analogue of the triangle inequality**, and like it, it can be strict: for $f(x) = x$ on $[-1,1]$ the left-hand side is $0$ and the right-hand side is $1$.

- **Forward reference, orientation only.** The witness refuting the converse of claim 1 is [[cex-absolute-value-integrable-without-the-function]] on the companion page; nothing above depends on it.

## Statement

Let $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be order-convex with at least two elements
([[def-interval]]) and let $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $I$
([[def-continuity-real]]). Call $G : I \to \mathbb{R}$ a **primitive of $f$ on
$I$** when $G$ is differentiable at every point of $I$ as a function on $I$ with
$G' = f$ there ([[def-derivative]]). Then:

1. **Existence.** Fix $c_0 \in I$. The function
   $$F : I \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad F(x) \;:=\; \int_{c_0}^x f$$
   is defined at every $x \in I$ ([[def-oriented-integral]],
   [[def-the-integral-function]]) and is a primitive of $f$ on $I$.
2. **Uniqueness up to a constant.** If $G_1$ and $G_2$ are primitives of $f$ on
   $I$ then there is a real $k$ with $G_1(x) = G_2(x) + k$ for every $x \in I$.
3. **Evaluation.** If $a, b \in I$ with $a < b$ and $G$ is any primitive of $f$
   on $I$, then
   $$\int_a^b f \;=\; G(b) - G(a) .$$

**The scope is exactly the continuous case, and that is not a limitation of the
proof.** An integrable function need not have a primitive, and a function with a
primitive need not be integrable; this corollary is precisely the intersection
where both fundamental theorems apply, and both witnesses are on the companion
page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An order-convex $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ with at least two elements, a continuous $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$, a base point $c_0 \in I$, and a real $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] A continuous function on a closed bounded interval with distinct endpoints is integrable there; a restriction of a continuous function is continuous ([[thm-continuous-implies-integrable]], [[def-continuity-real]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L2] Order-convexity: if $p, q \in I$ then every real between $p$ and $q$ lies in $I$, so the closed interval with endpoints $p$ and $q$ is contained in $I$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L3] $\int_p^p u = 0$, $\int_q^p u = -\int_p^q u$, and for $u$ integrable on a closed bounded interval containing $p,q,r$ one has $\int_p^q u + \int_q^r u = \int_p^r u$ ([[def-oriented-integral]], [[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]], claim 3).

[L4] First fundamental theorem: if $u$ is integrable on $[p,q]$ with $p<q$ and continuous at $c \in [p,q]$, then $x \mapsto \int_p^x u$ has derivative $u(c)$ at $c$ as a function on $[p,q]$; written out, for every real $\varepsilon>0$ there is a real $\delta>0$ with $\bigl|\bigl(\int_p^x u - \int_p^c u\bigr)/(x-c) - u(c)\bigr| < \varepsilon$ for every $x \in [p,q]$ with $0<|x-c|<\delta$ ([[thm-ftc-first-part]], [[def-derivative]], [[def-function-limit]]).

[L5] Second fundamental theorem: if $H$ is differentiable at every point of $[p,q]$ with $H'$ integrable there, then $\int_p^q H' = H(q)-H(p)$ ([[thm-ftc-second-part]]).

[L6] If $u$ is continuous on an order-convex $I$ and differentiable with $u' = 0$ at every interior point of $I$, then $u$ is constant on $I$ ([[cor-zero-derivative-implies-constant]]).

[L7] A differentiable function is continuous, and the restriction of a function differentiable at $c$ to a subset still having $c$ as a limit point is differentiable at $c$ with the same derivative; every point of a nondegenerate interval is a limit point of it ([[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]], [[def-derivative]], [[def-interval]]).

[L8] Ordered-field arithmetic and minima of two reals: the order is total and transitive, and $\min\{s,t\}$ is a real that is $\le$ both ([[def-max-min]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **$F$ is defined.** For $x \in I$ the closed interval with endpoints $c_0$ and $x$ lies in $I$ by [L2], $f$ is continuous there, hence integrable when $x \ne c_0$ by [L1], and $\int_{c_0}^{c_0} f = 0$ by [L3]; so $F(x)$ names a real for every $x \in I$. [given, L1, L2, L3]

1.2 **A closed neighbourhood inside $I$.** Fix $c \in I$. If some element of $I$ is $< c$, choose $u \in I$ with $u < c$; otherwise put $u := c$. If some element of $I$ is $> c$, choose $v \in I$ with $v > c$; otherwise put $v := c$. Not both $u = c$ and $v = c$, since $I$ would then have $c$ as its only element; so $u < v$, and $[u,v] \subseteq I$ by [L2]. [given, L2, choose]

1.3 **Claim 2.** Let $G_1, G_2$ be primitives of $f$ on $I$ and put $u := G_1 - G_2$. Then $u$ is differentiable at every point of $I$ with $u' = f - f = 0$ there, in particular at every interior point of $I$, and $u$ is continuous on $I$ by [L7]; so [L6] gives a real $k$ with $u \equiv k$. [L6, L7]

2.1 Put $\eta := \min\{\,c-u,\ v-c\,\}$ if $u<c$ and $c<v$, $\eta := v-c$ if $u = c$, and $\eta := c-u$ if $v = c$; in every case $\eta > 0$. [step 1.2, L8, construct]

2.2 $f$ is integrable on $[u,v]$ by [L1], and for $x \in [u,v]$, [L3] applied to the points $c_0, u, x$ inside the closed interval with endpoints $\min\{c_0,u\}$ and $\max\{c_0,v\}$, which lies in $I$ by [L2], gives $F(x) = F(u) + \int_u^x f$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1, L2, L3]

3.1 **Every point of $I$ within $\eta$ of $c$ lies in $[u,v]$.** Let $x \in I$ with $|x-c| < \eta$. If $x < c$ then $I$ has an element below $c$, so $u < c$ and $\eta \le c-u$, whence $x > c-\eta \ge u$. If $x > c$ then symmetrically $x < c+\eta \le v$. And $u \le c \le v$ covers $x = c$. So $u \le x \le v$. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L8]

3.2 Hence for $x \in [u,v]$ with $x \ne c$, $\bigl(F(x)-F(c)\bigr)/(x-c) = \bigl(\int_u^x f - \int_u^c f\bigr)/(x-c)$, the constant $F(u)$ cancelling. [step 2.2, algebra]

3.3 By [L4] applied on $[u,v]$ at the point $c$, fix a real $\delta > 0$ with $\bigl|\bigl(\int_u^x f - \int_u^c f\bigr)/(x-c) - f(c)\bigr| < \varepsilon$ for every $x \in [u,v]$ with $0<|x-c|<\delta$, and put $\delta' := \min\{\delta,\eta\} > 0$. [step 2.2, given, L1, L4, L8, choose]

4.1 Every $x \in I$ with $0 < |x-c| < \delta'$ lies in $[u,v]$ by step 3.1, so by step 3.2 and step 3.3, $\bigl|\bigl(F(x)-F(c)\bigr)/(x-c) - f(c)\bigr| < \varepsilon$. [step 3.1, step 3.2, step 3.3]

5.1 As $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary and $c$ is a limit point of $I$ by [L7], $F$ is differentiable at $c$ with $F'(c) = f(c)$; since $c \in I$ was arbitrary, $F$ is a primitive of $f$ on $I$, which is claim 1. [step 1.2, step 4.1, L7]

6.1 **Claim 3.** Let $a<b$ in $I$ and let $G$ be a primitive of $f$ on $I$. Then $[a,b] \subseteq I$ by [L2], the restriction of $G$ to $[a,b]$ is differentiable at every point of $[a,b]$ with derivative $f$ there by [L7], and $f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ by [L1]; so [L5] gives $\int_a^b f = G(b)-G(a)$. [L1, L2, L5, L7] ∎

## Remarks

- **Steps 1.2, 2.1 and 3.1 are the only work beyond citing the two fundamental theorems.** [[thm-ftc-first-part]] is stated on a closed bounded interval, while $I$ here may be open, half-open or unbounded, so the derivative it produces is the derivative of a *restriction*. What those steps supply is a closed subinterval $[u,v] \subseteq I$ that contains all points of $I$ within $\eta$ of $c$, after which the difference quotients of $F$ and of the restriction agree on a punctured neighbourhood and the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ statement transfers verbatim.

- **"Two primitives differ by a constant" is not re-minted here.** [[cor-zero-derivative-implies-constant]] already states exactly that, in its second clause, for functions with equal derivatives on an order-convex domain; claim 2 is that statement applied to $G_1 - G_2$.

- **Order-convexity of $I$ is essential to claim 2 and harmless elsewhere.** On a domain in two pieces a function may be constant on each with different constants, which is why [[cor-zero-derivative-implies-constant]] carries the same hypothesis. Claims 1 and 3 use it only to know that closed subintervals spanned by points of $I$ lie in $I$.

- **Forward references, orientation only.** The two witnesses bounding the scope of this corollary are [[cex-an-integrable-function-with-no-primitive]] and [[cex-a-function-with-a-primitive-that-is-not-integrable]] on the companion page; nothing above depends on either.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field with its order and
absolute value ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]), and
neighbourhoods are those of [[def-neighbourhood-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Then
$f$ is **continuous at $c$** when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

with $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ ranging over the **positive reals**. In the
language of neighbourhoods: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ with

$$f\bigl(A \cap N_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \;\subseteq\; N_{\varepsilon}\bigl(f(c)\bigr).$$

$f$ is **continuous on $A$** when it is continuous at every point of $A$.

**The point $c$ is required to lie in $A$, and the condition is unpunctured.**
Both differ from [[def-function-limit]], and deliberately. There the quantifier
runs over $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, which removes $x = c$; here $x = c$ is allowed,
and at $x = c$ the implication reads $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$, which is
automatic. So allowing $x = c$ costs nothing, and it is what lets the definition
be stated at every point of $A$, including the points where no limit exists.

**Three clauses, and all three are part of the definition.**

1. **At a limit point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is a limit point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]). Then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if the
   limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) \;=\; f(c)$$
   ([[def-function-limit]]). Indeed, for a given $\varepsilon > 0$ a $\delta$
   witnessing continuity witnesses the limit condition, because the limit
   condition quantifies over a subset of the points continuity quantifies over;
   and conversely a $\delta$ witnessing $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$ witnesses
   continuity, because the one point it omits, $x = c$, satisfies
   $|f(c) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ anyway.

2. **At an isolated point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is an isolated point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so that $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ for some real
   $\eta > 0$. Then **every** $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$: take
   $\delta := \eta$, so that the only $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ is $c$
   itself, and $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$.

3. **On a set.** Continuity on $A$ is continuity at each point of $A$, and
   nothing more. It is not a condition relating $f$ to points outside $A$.

Every point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$,
and never both ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so clauses 1 and 2 between them describe
continuity at every point of $A$.

**This is not the raw $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula of
[[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]].** That item records what goes
wrong when the *punctured* formula of [[def-function-limit]] is written down at
an arbitrary point of the domain: at an isolated point it is satisfied
vacuously by every real $L$ at once, so it defines nothing, and this library
therefore leaves $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ **undefined** at an isolated point.
Continuity at an isolated point is a different matter: the formula above is not
vacuous — it is a genuine condition on $f(c)$, satisfied because $f(c)$ is the
only value being compared with itself — and it names a single, well-defined
property. The limit is undefined there; the continuity is defined, and is
automatic. Clause 1 is the only place where the two notions meet, and it is
stated only where the limit exists as a notion.

**Where the distinction disappears.** If $A$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), then every $c \in A$ has some
$N_{\eta}(c) \subseteq A$, and a punctured neighbourhood is never empty
([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), so every point of $A$ is a limit point of $A$ and
clause 1 covers the whole of $A$. The same holds when $A$ is a nondegenerate
interval ([[def-interval]]). Isolated points are what force clause 2 to exist at
all, and they occur as soon as $A$ is allowed to be an arbitrary subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, as in $A = \{0\} \cup [1,2]$.

## Remarks

- **Continuity is local.** If $\eta > 0$ and $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agrees with
  $f$ on $A \cap N_{\eta}(c)$, then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if $g$
  is: any $\delta$ may be replaced by $\min\{\delta, \eta\}$, after which the
  condition only ever evaluates the two functions where they agree. So
  continuity at $c$ sees only an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of $c$, exactly
  as the limit does ([[lem-limit-is-local]]).

- **Continuity passes to subsets of the domain.** If $B \subseteq A$ and
  $c \in B$, then continuity of $f$ at $c$ gives continuity of the restriction
  $f|_B$ at $c$, with the same $\delta$: the condition on $f|_B$ quantifies over
  fewer points. The converse fails, and the standard witness is the indicator of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ restricted to $\mathbb{Q}$, which is constant and hence
  continuous, while the indicator itself is continuous nowhere
  ([[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]]).

- **The radius is a real number.** As in [[def-neighbourhood-r]], $\varepsilon$
  and $\delta$ range over the positive reals here. Restricting either quantifier
  to the positive rationals defines the same relation, by the passage recorded
  in [[def-function-limit]]: below every positive real lies a positive rational
  ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and a real $\delta$ may be shrunk to a rational
  one below it.

- **The word *continuous* is used for two things in this library, and they
  agree.** [[def-metric-continuity]] defines continuity of a map between metric
  spaces, and $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ carries the metric $d(x,y) = |x-y|$. The
  two notions coincide, and that is proved, not assumed:
  [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]] is the dictionary, and it is stated on
  this page precisely so that no later item has to guess.

## Definition

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]). Write $\mathcal{P}$ for the set of all partitions of
$[a,b]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]) and put

$$\mathcal{L} \;:=\; \{\, L(f,P) \ : \ P \in \mathcal{P} \,\}, \qquad \mathcal{U} \;:=\; \{\, U(f,P) \ : \ P \in \mathcal{P} \,\}$$

for the sets of lower and of upper Darboux sums ([[def-darboux-sums]]).

### Both extrema exist

**$\mathcal{P}$ is nonempty**: the pair $(1, t)$ with $t_0 := a$ and $t_k := b$
for $k \ge 1$ is a partition of $[a,b]$, since $a < b$. So $\mathcal{L}$ and
$\mathcal{U}$ are nonempty.

**$\mathcal{L}$ is bounded above and $\mathcal{U}$ is bounded below.** Fix any
$Q \in \mathcal{P}$. By claim 2 of [[lem-refinement-inequalities]],
$L(f,P) \le U(f,Q)$ for every $P \in \mathcal{P}$, so $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound
of $\mathcal{L}$; and $L(f,Q) \le U(f,P)$ for every $P$, so $L(f,Q)$ is a lower
bound of $\mathcal{U}$.

Hence a nonempty set bounded above has a supremum
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and a nonempty set bounded below has an infimum
([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]), each unique ([[lem-sup-unique]]).
The **lower** and **upper Darboux integrals** of $f$ over $[a,b]$ are the real
numbers

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;:=\; \sup \mathcal{L} \;=\; \sup_{P} L(f,P), \qquad \overline{\int_a^b} f \;:=\; \inf \mathcal{U} \;=\; \inf_{P} U(f,P) .$$

### The lower integral never exceeds the upper one

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f .$$

Indeed, for each fixed $Q \in \mathcal{P}$ the number $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound
of $\mathcal{L}$, so the least upper bound satisfies
$\underline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,Q)$. As $Q$ was arbitrary, $\underline{\int_a^b}f$
is a lower bound of $\mathcal{U}$, and the greatest lower bound satisfies
$\underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f$ ([[def-infimum]]).

Moreover, for **every** partition $P$,

$$L(f,P) \;\le\; \underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; U(f,P) ,$$

the outer inequalities because a member of a set is at most its supremum and at
least its infimum.

### Integrability

$f$ is **Darboux integrable on $[a,b]$**, and on this page simply
**integrable**, when

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;=\; \overline{\int_a^b} f ,$$

and then the common value is written

$$\int_a^b f \qquad \text{or} \qquad \int_a^b f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x ,$$

the **integral of $f$ over $[a,b]$**. It is a single well-determined real
number, being the common value of two numbers each of which is unique
([[lem-sup-unique]]). Without the displayed equality the symbol $\int_a^b f$ is
not defined and is never written.

**The inequality above is the whole difficulty.** By the previous paragraph
integrability is *never* a question of one integral exceeding the other, only of
the gap $\overline{\int_a^b} f - \underline{\int_a^b} f \ge 0$ being $0$; and by
[[thm-riemann-criterion]] that gap is $0$ exactly when a single partition can be
found making $U(f,P) - L(f,P)$ small. Whether that is possible is settled
completely, in terms of the discontinuities of $f$, by
[[thm-lebesgue-criterion]].

**"Riemann integrable" means the same thing here.** The definition above is
Darboux's. Riemann's own definition, in terms of tagged partitions of small
mesh, is [[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]], and the two define the same
class of functions with the same integral by [[thm-darboux-equals-riemann]].
Until that theorem is proved the two phrases are kept apart; after it they are
used interchangeably, as they are throughout the literature.

## Remarks

- **The supremum is over all partitions, and nothing is selected.** Both
  $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{U}$ are sets determined by $f$ and $[a,b]$ alone,
  and $\sup$ and $\inf$ are canonical, so no choice principle is involved in
  forming either integral. Where a choice does enter on this page is recorded in
  [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].

- **Why the lower integral is a supremum and not an infimum.** Refining a
  partition can only increase a lower sum and decrease an upper sum
  ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]]), so the lower sums push up towards the
  integral and the upper sums push down towards it. Taking $\inf \mathcal{L}$
  would return the sum over the coarsest partition and would carry no
  information about $f$ beyond its infimum on $[a,b]$.

- **A bounded $f$ always has both integrals; only their equality can fail.** The
  Dirichlet function on $[0,1]$ has lower integral $0$ and upper integral $1$
  ([[fs-bounded-implies-riemann-integrable]]), which is the standard witness that
  the definition above is not vacuous in either direction.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), neighbourhoods are those of
[[def-neighbourhood-r]] and limit points those of [[def-limit-point-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$ be a
**limit point of $A$**. The **difference quotient of $f$ at $c$** is the function

$$q_{f,c} : A \setminus \{c\} \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad q_{f,c}(x) := \frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c} .$$

The division is legitimate at every point of the domain, since $x \ne c$ gives
$x - c \ne 0$.

**The point $c$ is a limit point of $A \setminus \{c\}$, not merely of $A$.**
For every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the punctured neighbourhood
$N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c)$ omits $c$, so

$$N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c) \cap A \;=\; N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c) \cap (A \setminus \{c\}) ,$$

and the left-hand side is nonempty because $c$ is a limit point of $A$. So
$q_{f,c}$ is a function on a set having $c$ as a limit point, and
$\lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x)$ is a notion that [[def-function-limit]] defines.

$f$ is **differentiable at $c$** when that limit exists, and then the
**derivative of $f$ at $c$** is

$$f'(c) \;:=\; \lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x) \;=\; \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c} .$$

**Two obligations are carried by that notation, and both are discharged here.**

1. **Uniqueness.** Writing $f'(c)$ treats the right-hand side as a name for a
   single real number. That is legitimate: $c$ is a limit point of the domain
   $A \setminus \{c\}$ of $q_{f,c}$, so at most one real can satisfy the
   $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ condition, by [[lem-function-limit-unique]] applied to
   $q_{f,c}$. Two reals both meeting the condition are therefore equal, and the
   symbol denotes.
2. **Meaningfulness.** The hypothesis that $c$ is a limit point of $A$ is not
   decoration. At an **isolated** point of $A$ the punctured condition
   $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ is met by no point of the domain at all, so the
   $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula is satisfied vacuously by *every* real at
   once; this is why [[def-function-limit]] leaves the limit undefined there,
   and it is why this library defines $f'(c)$ only at a limit point of $A$. At
   an isolated point of its domain a function is neither differentiable nor
   non-differentiable here: the question is not posed.

**The limit sees only $A \setminus \{c\}$, so how the difference quotient is
extended to $c$ is irrelevant.** Let $Q : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agree with
$q_{f,c}$ at every point of $A \setminus \{c\}$, and let $L \in \mathbb{R}$.
Then $\lim_{x \to c} Q(x) = L$ if and only if $\lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x) = L$.
Both conditions read: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ such that every point $x$ of the relevant domain with
$0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|{\cdot} - L| < \varepsilon$
([[def-function-limit]]). The clause $0 < |x - c|$ removes $x = c$ from both
quantifiers, so in both cases the points quantified over are exactly the
$x \in A \setminus \{c\}$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, at which $Q$ and
$q_{f,c}$ take the same value. The two conditions are the same condition.

**Differentiability on a set.** For $S \subseteq A$, $f$ is **differentiable on
$S$** when it is differentiable at every $c \in S$; implicit in that phrase is
that every point of $S$ is a limit point of $A$. $f$ is **differentiable** when
it is differentiable on the whole of $A$.

**Restriction of the domain.** Let $B \subseteq A$, let $c \in B$ and suppose
$c$ is a limit point of $B$. If $f$ is differentiable at $c$, then so is the
restriction $f|_B : B \to \mathbb{R}$, and

$$(f|_B)'(c) \;=\; f'(c) .$$

Indeed $B \setminus \{c\} \subseteq A \setminus \{c\}$; the displayed identity
of punctured neighbourhoods above, applied to $B$, shows that $c$ is a limit
point of $B \setminus \{c\}$; the difference quotient $q_{f|_B, c}$ is the
restriction of $q_{f,c}$ to $B \setminus \{c\}$, since $f|_B(c) = f(c)$; and
claim 2 of [[lem-limit-is-local]] carries the limit to that restriction.

**Every point of a nondegenerate interval is a limit point of it.** Let
$J \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be order-convex ([[def-interval]]) with at least two
elements and let $p \in J$. Choose $q \in J$ with $q \ne p$, and let a real
$\varepsilon > 0$ be given. If $p < q$, put $y := p + \tfrac{1}{2}\min\{\varepsilon,\ q - p\}$;
then $p < y$, and $y - p \le \tfrac{1}{2}(q-p) < q - p$, so $p < y < q$ and
order-convexity gives $y \in J$, while $0 < |y - p| < \varepsilon$. If $q < p$,
the point $y := p - \tfrac{1}{2}\min\{\varepsilon,\ p - q\}$ serves in the same
way. So $N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(p) \cap J \ne \varnothing$ for every real
$\varepsilon > 0$, that is, $p$ is a limit point of $J$
([[def-limit-point-r]]).

Consequently, for $f$ defined on a nondegenerate interval $I$, the symbol
$f'(c)$ is meaningful at **every** $c \in I$, endpoints included. At an endpoint
the difference quotient is taken over the points of $I$ lying on the one side
that is available, so what other texts call a one-sided derivative is, here,
simply the derivative of $f$ on $I$.

## Remarks

- **Notation.** $f'(c)$ and $\frac{df}{dx}(c)$ denote the same real number, and
  this library uses the first. Neither is an operation performed on a symbol
  $x$: the variable in the second is a name for the argument and nothing more.

- **Differentiability is a property of the pair $(f, A)$ at $c$, not of $f$
  alone.** The restriction clause above goes in one direction only, and the
  converse fails. Take $A := \mathbb{R}$, $f(x) := |x|$, $B := [0,\infty)$ and
  $c := 0$. Then $f|_B$ is the identity on $B$, whose difference quotient at $0$
  is constantly $1$, so $f|_B$ is differentiable at $0$ with derivative $1$;
  that $f$ itself is not differentiable at $0$ is
  [[cex-absolute-value-is-not-differentiable-at-zero]] on the companion page.
  So enlarging the domain can destroy differentiability, and the phrase
  "$f$ is differentiable at $c$" always carries the domain with it.

- **The relation to continuity is not definitional.** [[def-continuity-real]]
  is a condition on $f$ near $c$ that does not mention a quotient, and it is
  defined at every point of $A$, isolated points included, whereas
  differentiability is defined only at limit points of $A$. That
  differentiability implies continuity is a theorem on this page and not a
  reading of the definitions.

- **No second derivative and no one-sided derivative is introduced here.**
  Both are standard, and both are absent from this page on purpose;
  [[rem-derivative-conventions]] records exactly what is fixed and what is left
  open at this point in the reading order.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]] and closure as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]].

- $x$ is an **adherent point** of $A$ when $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne
  \varnothing$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$.
- $x$ is a **limit point** (or *accumulation point*) of $A$ when
  $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every real
  $\varepsilon > 0$: every punctured neighbourhood of $x$ meets $A$.
- $x$ is an **isolated point** of $A$ when $x \in A$ and there is a real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$.
- The **derived set** of $A$ is
  $$A' \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \text{ is a limit point of } A \,\}.$$
- $A$ is **dense in $\mathbb{R}$** when $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$.

**A limit point is an adherent point**, since $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq
N_\varepsilon(x)$; and an element of $A$ is an adherent point of $A$, since
$x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). So the adherent
points of $A$ are exactly the points of $A \cup A'$, a statement proved as part
of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

**Limit point and isolated point are exact opposites inside $A$.** For
$x \in A$: $x$ is an isolated point of $A$ exactly when it is not a limit point
of $A$. Indeed $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$ says precisely that
$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, because $x$ itself always lies in
$N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ when $x \in A$; so the existence of an $\varepsilon$
witnessing isolation is the negation of the condition defining a limit point.
A point of $A$ is therefore either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$, and
never both.

**A limit point need not belong to the set, and a point of the set need not be a
limit point.** Both possibilities occur, and the two examples that matter later
are $0$, which is a limit point of $\{\, 1/k : k \ge 1 \,\}$ without belonging
to it, and $0$ again, which belongs to $\{0\} \cup [1,2]$ as an isolated point.

## Remarks

- **Terminology: *limit point* here is about a set, never about a sequence.**
  This library reserves *subsequential limit* for the sequential notion
  ([[def-subsequential-limit]]), and the two are genuinely different: the
  constant sequence $x_k = 0$ has $0$ as a subsequential limit, while its set of
  values $\{0\}$ has no limit point at all. The distinction is the one
  [[def-subsequential-limit]] records under "Terminology", and it is respected
  throughout this page.

- **Density is defined through the closure, not through intervals.** Saying
  $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$ is equivalent to saying that every nonempty open
  subset of $\mathbb{R}$ meets $A$, and also to saying that every neighbourhood
  of every real meets $A$; the equivalences follow from
  [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] and are used in that form in
  [[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]].

- **The derived set need not be comparable with the set.** It can be strictly
  larger, as for $\mathbb{Q}$: every punctured neighbourhood of any real
  contains a rational, since density supplies one strictly between $x$ and
  $x + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]), so the derived set of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is all of $\mathbb{R}$. It can be strictly smaller, as for
  $\{0\}$, whose derived set is empty; and it can be neither, as for
  $\{0\} \cup (1,2)$, whose derived set is $[1,2]$, a set containing points
  outside the original and omitting the point $0$ of it. A closed set satisfying
  $A \subseteq A'$ is called perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]).

## Definition

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $m \in \mathbb{R}$.

- $m$ is a **maximum** (or *greatest element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $s \le m$
  for every $s \in S$.
- $m$ is a **minimum** (or *least element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $m \le s$
  for every $s \in S$.

A set has at most one maximum: if $m_1$ and $m_2$ are both maxima then
$m_1 \in S$ gives $m_1 \le m_2$ and $m_2 \in S$ gives $m_2 \le m_1$, so
$m_1 = m_2$ by antisymmetry of the order, which is immediate from the trichotomy
axiom of an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).
The same argument applies to minima, so we may write $\max S$ and $\min S$.

## Remarks

- A maximum is precisely an upper bound of $S$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]])
  that happens to lie in $S$; a minimum is a lower bound of $S$
  ([[def-bounded-set]]) that lies in $S$. In particular a set with a maximum is
  bounded above and a set with a minimum is bounded below.
- The empty set has neither a maximum nor a minimum, because the requirement
  $m \in S$ cannot be met.
- The membership requirement $m \in S$ is exactly what separates a maximum from a
  supremum, and it is the theme of this page. A supremum is a bound on the set
  and is not asked to belong to it; a maximum is an element of the set. The two
  agree exactly when the supremum happens to be attained ([[lem-max-is-sup]]),
  and they genuinely differ in general ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has both a maximum and a minimum
  ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]), which is what licenses the notation
  $\max\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$. Infinite sets need not: the failure of attainment is
  an infinitary phenomenon.

## Definition

**Why this item is first.** The published definition of the integral does not
cover this page. [[def-darboux-integral]] is stated for reals $a < b$, because
the partitions it quantifies over are those of [[def-partition-and-refinement]],
whose standing hypothesis is $a < b$: with $a = b$ the chain
$a = t_0 < \dots < t_n = b$ is unsatisfiable. So $\int_a^b f$ is an undefined
symbol whenever $a \ge b$, and every additivity statement below would be
ill-formed as it is usually written. This item extends the notation, and nothing
else: the object it names is still the Darboux integral of
[[def-darboux-integral]].

Let $u, v \in \mathbb{R}$ and write

$$[u \wedge v,\ u \vee v] \;:=\; \text{the closed interval with endpoints } u \text{ and } v$$

([[def-interval]]). Let $f$ be a real-valued function whose domain contains that
interval. Say that **$f$ is integrable between $u$ and $v$** when either $u = v$,
or $u \ne v$ and the restriction of $f$ to $[u \wedge v,\ u \vee v]$ is bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]) and Darboux integrable there ([[def-darboux-integral]],
[[def-darboux-sums]]). For such $f$ define

$$\int_u^v f \;:=\; \begin{cases} \text{the Darboux integral of } f \text{ over } [u,v] & \text{if } u < v, \\[2pt] 0 & \text{if } u = v, \\[2pt] -\displaystyle\int_v^u f & \text{if } u > v. \end{cases}$$

**There is nothing to check for consistency.** The three clauses are indexed by
the three cases of trichotomy, $u < v$, $u = v$ and $u > v$, which are mutually
exclusive and exhaustive; no pair of them ever applies to the same $(u,v)$. In
particular the first clause is untouched, so on $u < v$ this is the published
integral verbatim and every published theorem about it applies unchanged.

**The middle clause is a stipulation, not a computation.** It is *not* claimed
that $0$ is a value forced by the $u < v$ definition in any limiting sense; that
definition simply says nothing at $u = v$, and $\int_u^u f := 0$ is what is
written there. It is also unconditional: no hypothesis on $f$ beyond being
defined at $u$ is asked for, since the case $u = v$ never refers to a partition.

### The two consequences used throughout the page

**Antisymmetry, for every pair.** For all reals $u, v$ with $f$ integrable
between them,

$$\int_u^v f \;=\; -\int_v^u f .$$

Indeed if $u < v$ then $v > u$ and the third clause reads
$\int_v^u f = -\int_u^v f$, which rearranges to the display; if $u = v$ both
sides are $0$; and if $u > v$ the third clause is the display itself.

**Absolute values agree.** Consequently
$\bigl|\int_u^v f\bigr| = \bigl|\int_v^u f\bigr|$ for every such pair.

**An obligation recorded here and discharged elsewhere.** With this convention
the additivity identity

$$\int_u^v f \;+\; \int_v^w f \;=\; \int_u^w f$$

holds for **every** arrangement of $u, v, w$ in an interval on which $f$ is
integrable, not only for $u < v < w$. That is a theorem and not part of this
definition; it is proved as the last clause of
[[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]], and nothing on this page uses it before it
is proved there.

## Remarks

- **This is notation, and it is a real notation.** Without it the substitution
  theorem could not be stated with the limits $\varphi(c)$ and $\varphi(d)$ in
  the order the map produces them, since a differentiable $\varphi$ need be
  neither injective nor monotone; and the integral function $x \mapsto \int_a^x f$
  would be undefined at $x = a$.

- **One published inequality is not orientation-invariant, and that is a trap.**
  The estimate $\bigl|\int_u^v f\bigr| \le \int_u^v |f|$ is guaranteed only
  for $u \le v$: at $u > v$ the right-hand side is $-\int_v^u |f| \le 0$ while
  the left-hand side is $\ge 0$, so the inequality fails whenever
  $\int_v^u |f| > 0$. The form valid for every pair is
  $\bigl|\int_u^v f\bigr| \le \bigl|\int_u^v |f|\bigr|$, and this is stated where
  it is proved ([[cor-integrability-of-absolute-values-products-and-lattice-operations]]).

- **Integrability is a property of the unordered pair.** By construction, $f$ is
  integrable between $u$ and $v$ if and only if it is integrable between $v$ and
  $u$, since both refer to the same closed interval; only the sign of the value
  remembers the order.

## Statement

**False claim:** let $c<d$ be reals, let $\varphi : [c,d] \to \mathbb{R}$ be
differentiable at every point of $[c,d]$ with $\varphi'$ integrable, and let $f$
be Riemann integrable on an interval $J$ containing $\varphi[\,[c,d]\,]$. Then
$f\circ\varphi$ is Riemann integrable on $[c,d]$ — so the hypothesis "$f$ is
continuous" in [[thm-substitution]] may be weakened to "$f$ is integrable"
without the right-hand side $\int_c^d (f\circ\varphi)\varphi'$ losing its
meaning.

The claim is false. Let $S \subseteq [0,1]$ be the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set
([[def-fat-cantor-set]]), which is compact, nowhere dense and **not** null
([[thm-fat-cantor-set-has-positive-measure]]), and let

$$d_S(u) \;:=\; \inf\{\, |u-s| \ : \ s \in S \,\} , \qquad \varphi(x) \;:=\; \int_0^x d_S \quad (x \in [0,1]) .$$

Then $\varphi$ is differentiable at every point of $[0,1]$ with
$\varphi' = d_S$ continuous, hence integrable; $\varphi$ is strictly increasing;
and $\varphi[S]$ has measure zero. Taking

$$f \;:=\; \mathbf{1}_{\varphi[S]} \quad \text{on } J := \bigl[0,\ \varphi(1)\bigr]$$

gives an integrable $f$, because its discontinuity set is contained in the null
closed set $\varphi[S]$, while

$$f\circ\varphi \;=\; \mathbf{1}_{S} \quad \text{on } [0,1] ,$$

whose discontinuity set is exactly $S$ and is **not** null. So $f\circ\varphi$ is
not Riemann integrable.

**What this does and does not show.** It shows that continuity of $f$ in
[[thm-substitution]] cannot simply be weakened to integrability: the composite in
the right-hand side need not be integrable. It does **not** exhibit a pair for
which both sides of the substitution identity exist and differ, and no such pair
is claimed here.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The Smith-Volterra-Cantor set $S \subseteq [0,1]$, the function $d_S$ and the function $\varphi$ above, a real $\varepsilon>0$ and a natural number $N \ge 1$.

[L1] $S$ is a compact, nowhere dense subset of $[0,1]$; it is nonempty; and no cover of $S$ by intervals has total length below $2^{-1}$, so $S$ does not have measure zero ([[def-fat-cantor-set]], [[thm-fat-cantor-set-has-positive-measure]], [[def-nowhere-dense-meager]], [[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]], [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L2] Nowhere dense plus closed means empty interior: no nonempty open interval is contained in $S$ ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L3] $u \mapsto d_S(u)$ is defined for every real (the set is nonempty and bounded below by $0$) and is $1$-Lipschitz, hence continuous ([[lem-distance-to-set-is-lipschitz]], [[def-metric-bounded-diameter]], [[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]], [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]], clauses 3 and 6, [[def-infimum]], [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L4] A continuous function on a closed bounded interval with distinct endpoints is integrable there ([[thm-continuous-implies-integrable]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L5] First fundamental theorem: for $u$ integrable on $[p,q]$ and continuous at every point, $x \mapsto \int_p^x u$ is differentiable with derivative $u$ ([[thm-ftc-first-part]], [[def-the-integral-function]], [[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]], [[def-oriented-integral]]).

[L6] A continuous $w \ge 0$ on $[p,q]$ with $p<q$ and $\int_p^q w = 0$ vanishes identically ([[thm-nonnegative-continuous-with-zero-integral-vanishes]]).

[L7] If $\kappa \le w \le \mu$ on $[p,q]$ with $w$ integrable then $\kappa(q-p) \le \int_p^q w \le \mu(q-p)$ ([[thm-monotonicity-of-the-integral]], [[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]]).

[L8] The continuous image of a compact set is compact, and a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is closed and bounded ([[thm-continuous-image-of-a-compact-set-r]], [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]]).

[L9] Lebesgue's criterion: a bounded function on $[p,q]$ is integrable if and only if its discontinuity set has measure zero; a set of content zero has measure zero ([[thm-lebesgue-criterion]], [[lem-content-zero-implies-null]], [[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L10] Finite sums: monotonicity in the terms and $\sum_{i<N}\lambda = \iota(N)\lambda$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], clauses 2 and 4); $\iota(N) \ge 1 > 0$ for $N \ge 1$, and for every real $\eta>0$ there is $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N)<\eta$ ([[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]]).

[L11] Ordered-field arithmetic and suprema: a nonempty bounded set has a supremum and an infimum; $\min\{s,t\}$ is at most the average of $s$ and $t$ when $s+t$ is fixed; multiplying inequalities by positive reals preserves them; the order is total and transitive ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-infimum]], [[def-interval]], [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $d_S \ge 0$ everywhere, $d_S(u) = 0$ for $u \in S$, and $d_S(u) > 0$ for $u \notin S$: $S$ is closed by [L1], so some $\rho>0$ has $(u-\rho,u+\rho)\cap S = \varnothing$, whence $|u-s| \ge \rho$ for every $s \in S$ and $d_S(u) \ge \rho$. [given, L1, L3, L11]

2.1 $d_S$ is continuous by [L3], hence integrable on every $[0,x]$ with $x>0$ by [L4]; so $\varphi$ is defined on $[0,1]$, and by [L5] it is differentiable at every point of $[0,1]$ with $\varphi' = d_S$, which is integrable by [L4]. [step 1.1, L3, L4, L5]

3.1 **$\varphi$ is strictly increasing, hence injective.** For $0 \le x < y \le 1$, $\varphi(y)-\varphi(x) = \int_x^y d_S \ge 0$ by [L5] and [L7]; if it were $0$ then [L6] would force $d_S \equiv 0$ on $[x,y]$, so $[x,y] \subseteq S$ by step 1.1, contradicting [L2]. Hence $\varphi(x)<\varphi(y)$. In particular $\varphi(0)=0<\varphi(1)$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L2, L5, L6, L7]

3.2 **A quadratic contraction on $S$.** Let $x<y$ both lie in $S$. For $u \in [x,y]$ one has $d_S(u) \le \min\{u-x,\ y-u\} \le (y-x)\cdot 2^{-1}$, since $x,y \in S$; so by [L5] and [L7], $0 \le \varphi(y)-\varphi(x) = \int_x^y d_S \le (y-x)^{2}\cdot 2^{-1}$. [step 2.1, L5, L7, L11]

4.1 **$\varphi[S]$ has content zero.** Fix $N \ge 1$ and for $i<N$ put $J_i := [\iota(i)/\iota(N),\ \iota(i+1)/\iota(N)]$, so the $J_i$ cover $[0,1]$ and each has length $1/\iota(N)$. If $S \cap J_i \ne \varnothing$ let $E_i := \varphi[S \cap J_i]$, a nonempty bounded set, and put $a_i := \inf E_i$, $b_i := \sup E_i$; otherwise put $a_i := b_i := 0$. [step 3.2, L10, L11, construct]

5.1 For $z,w \in E_i$ one has $|z-w| \le \bigl(1/\iota(N)\bigr)^{2}\cdot 2^{-1}$ by step 3.2, the two preimages lying in $S \cap J_i$; hence $b_i \le a_i + \bigl(1/\iota(N)\bigr)^{2}\cdot 2^{-1}$, since every $z \in E_i$ is at most $w + (1/\iota(N))^{2}2^{-1}$ for each fixed $w$, and then $w \ge b_i - (1/\iota(N))^{2}2^{-1}$ for every $w$. [step 3.2, step 4.1, L11]

6.1 Every point of $\varphi[S]$ lies in some $[a_i,b_i]$, because every point of $S$ lies in some $J_i$; and $\sum_{i<N}(b_i-a_i) \le \iota(N)\cdot \bigl(1/\iota(N)\bigr)^{2}\cdot 2^{-1} = 1/\bigl(2\,\iota(N)\bigr)$ by [L10]. [step 4.1, step 5.1, L10]

7.1 Given $\varepsilon>0$, [L10] supplies $N \ge 1$ with $1/(2\iota(N)) \le \varepsilon$; so $\varphi[S]$ has content zero and therefore measure zero by [L9]. [step 6.1, L9, L10]

8.1 **$f := \mathbf{1}_{\varphi[S]}$ is integrable on $J = [0,\varphi(1)]$.** It is bounded, with values in $\{0,1\}$. $S$ is compact by [L1] and $\varphi$ is continuous by [L5] and [L3], so $\varphi[S]$ is compact, hence closed, by [L8]; therefore at every $z \in J \setminus \varphi[S]$ some neighbourhood misses $\varphi[S]$ and $f$ vanishes on it, so $f$ is continuous there. The discontinuity set of $f$ is thus contained in $\varphi[S]$, which is null by step 7.1, so $f$ is integrable by [L9]. [step 2.1, step 7.1, L1, L3, L8, L9]

9.1 **$f\circ\varphi = \mathbf{1}_{S}$ on $[0,1]$.** For $x \in [0,1]$: if $x \in S$ then $\varphi(x) \in \varphi[S]$ and $f(\varphi(x)) = 1$; if $x \notin S$ then $\varphi(x) \notin \varphi[S]$, since $\varphi$ is injective by step 3.1, and $f(\varphi(x)) = 0$. Also $\varphi[\,[0,1]\,] \subseteq J$ by step 3.1. [step 3.1, step 8.1]

10.1 **$\mathbf{1}_{S}$ is discontinuous at every point of $S$.** Let $x \in S$ and $\rho>0$; the set $(x-\rho,x+\rho)\cap(0,1)$ contains a nonempty open interval, which by [L2] is not contained in $S$, so some $y$ in it has $\mathbf{1}_S(y) = 0$ while $\mathbf{1}_S(x)=1$; no $\delta$ works for $\varepsilon = 2^{-1}$. At $x \notin S$ the function vanishes on a neighbourhood, $S$ being closed, so it is continuous there. [step 9.1, L1, L2, L11]

11.1 The discontinuity set of $f\circ\varphi$ on $[0,1]$ is therefore exactly $S$, which is not null by [L1]; so $f\circ\varphi$ is bounded and **not** Riemann integrable, by [L9]. [step 9.1, step 10.1, L1, L9]

12.1 So $\varphi$ is differentiable on $[0,1]$ with $\varphi'$ integrable, $f$ is integrable on an interval containing $\varphi[\,[0,1]\,]$, and $f\circ\varphi$ is not integrable: the claim is false, and the continuity hypothesis on $f$ in [[thm-substitution]] cannot be weakened to integrability. [step 2.1, step 8.1, step 9.1, step 11.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why $\varphi$ has to be built and cannot be a familiar function.** The set on which $f\circ\varphi$ misbehaves is $\varphi^{-1}$ of a null set, and for a Lipschitz $\varphi$ with $\varphi'$ bounded away from $0$ that preimage is again null. What makes the witness work is that $\varphi' = d_S$ vanishes on the whole of $S$, so $\varphi$ crushes a set of positive measure onto a null set while remaining injective; step 3.2 is the quantitative form of that crushing.

- **The substitution identity itself is not refuted here, and that is stated rather than glossed over.** For this very pair one has $(f\circ\varphi)\varphi' = \mathbf{1}_S \cdot d_S$, which is the zero function because $d_S$ vanishes on $S$; so the right-hand side of the substitution formula does exist for this pair and equals $0$, as does the left-hand side. What fails is the intermediate claim that the composite $f\circ\varphi$ is integrable, which is what a proof of the identity with $f$ merely integrable would have to establish, and which is what [[thm-substitution]]'s continuity hypothesis delivers through [[thm-composition-with-a-continuous-function]]. No pair with both sides defined and unequal is exhibited anywhere on this page.

- **The fat Cantor set is doing exactly one job.** It supplies a closed set with empty interior that is not null. Any such set would serve; $S$ is the published one, and [[thm-fat-cantor-set-has-positive-measure]] is what supplies all three properties without reproving them.

## Statement

Let $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ with
$g[A] \subseteq B$ and let $f : B \to \mathbb{R}$, so that the composite
$f \circ g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is defined. Let $c \in A$ be a limit point of
$A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]) at which $g$ is differentiable
([[def-derivative]]), put $b := g(c)$, and suppose $b$ is a limit point of $B$
at which $f$ is differentiable. Then $f \circ g$ is differentiable at $c$ and

$$(f \circ g)'(c) \;=\; f'\bigl(g(c)\bigr)\,g'(c) .$$

**Both limit-point hypotheses are needed, and neither is automatic.** That $c$
is a limit point of $A$ is what makes $g'(c)$ and $(f \circ g)'(c)$ defined
symbols; that $b = g(c)$ is a limit point of $B$ is what makes $f'(b)$ one.
Nothing forces the second: $g$ may be differentiable at $c$ and send $c$ to an
isolated point of $B$, and there $f'(b)$ is not defined and the formula asserts
nothing.

**No case analysis appears anywhere.** The naive difference-quotient proof
writes $\frac{f(g(x)) - f(g(c))}{g(x) - g(c)} \cdot \frac{g(x) - g(c)}{x - c}$
and then has to say what happens where $g(x) = g(c)$, which may occur at points
arbitrarily close to $c$. Carathéodory's factorisation never divides by the
inner increment, so the difficulty does not arise.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sets $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, functions $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ with $g[A] \subseteq B$ and $f : B \to \mathbb{R}$, a point $c \in A$ that is a limit point of $A$ at which $g$ is differentiable, and the point $b := g(c) \in B$, a limit point of $B$ at which $f$ is differentiable ([[def-derivative]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L1] Carathéodory's characterisation ([[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]]), used in both directions: for $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a point $p \in D$ that is a limit point of $D$ and $h : D \to \mathbb{R}$, the function $h$ is differentiable at $p$ if and only if there is $\eta : D \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $p$, with $h(y) - h(p) = \eta(y)(y - p)$ for every $y \in D$, and then $\eta(p) = h'(p)$.

[L2] Algebra of continuous functions ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], claim 1): a product of two functions continuous at a point of their common domain is continuous there.

[L3] Composition of continuous functions ([[thm-composition-of-continuous-functions]]): if $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ has $g[A] \subseteq B$ and is continuous at $c \in A$, and if $\eta : B \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $g(c)$, then $\eta \circ g$ is continuous at $c$ ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L4] A function differentiable at a point is continuous there ([[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L1], applied to $g$ on $A$ at $c$, fix $\psi : A \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $c$, with $g(x) - g(c) = \psi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in A$ and $\psi(c) = g'(c)$. [L1, choose]

1.2 By [L1], applied to $f$ on $B$ at $b$, fix $\varphi : B \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $b$, with $f(y) - f(b) = \varphi(y)(y - b)$ for every $y \in B$ and $\varphi(b) = f'(b)$. [L1, choose]

2.1 **The factorisation.** Let $x \in A$. Then $g(x) \in B$, so taking $y := g(x)$ in step 1.2 gives $f(g(x)) - f(b) = \varphi(g(x))\bigl(g(x) - b\bigr)$, and $g(x) - b = g(x) - g(c) = \psi(x)(x-c)$ by step 1.1. Since $(f \circ g)(c) = f(g(c)) = f(b)$, this reads $(f \circ g)(x) - (f \circ g)(c) = \chi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in A$, where $\chi : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is the pointwise product $\chi := (\varphi \circ g)\,\psi$. [step 1.1, step 1.2]

2.2 **The outer factor is continuous at $c$.** By [L4] the function $g$ is continuous at $c$; by step 1.2 the function $\varphi$ is continuous at $b = g(c)$; and $g[A] \subseteq B$. So $\varphi \circ g$ is continuous at $c$ by [L3]. [step 1.2, L3, L4]

3.1 **The factor is continuous at $c$, with the right value.** $\chi$ is the product of $\varphi \circ g$, continuous at $c$ by step 2.2, with $\psi$, continuous at $c$ by step 1.1, so $\chi$ is continuous at $c$ by [L2]; and $\chi(c) = \varphi(g(c))\,\psi(c) = \varphi(b)\,\psi(c) = f'(b)\,g'(c)$. [step 1.1, step 2.2, L2]

4.1 By step 2.1 the function $\chi : A \to \mathbb{R}$ factors the increment of $f \circ g$ at $c$, and by step 3.1 it is continuous at $c$. So [L1], applied to $f \circ g$ on $A$ at the limit point $c$, gives that $f \circ g$ is differentiable at $c$ with $(f \circ g)'(c) = \chi(c) = f'(g(c))\,g'(c)$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the classical proof goes wrong, precisely.** It divides by $g(x) - g(c)$, which may vanish at points arbitrarily close to $c$ even when $g$ is differentiable at $c$ with $g'(c) = 0$; the usual repair defines an auxiliary function equal to the outer quotient off the bad set and to $f'(b)$ on it, and then proves that auxiliary function continuous. That auxiliary function is $\varphi \circ g$, and [[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]] is the observation that it exists before any repair is attempted.

- **What is composed is continuity, not differentiability.** The only theorem about composites used above is [[thm-composition-of-continuous-functions]], and it needs no side hypothesis, unlike the corresponding statement for limits. That is the whole reason the proof has no cases.

- **The formula is about the point $g(c)$, not about $g$ near $c$.** Both derivatives on the right are taken at single points, and the theorem says nothing about $f$ on the image of any neighbourhood of $c$. In particular no hypothesis is placed on $g[A]$ beyond its lying in $B$.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ and $m \le M$ be reals, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]) with

$$m \;\le\; f(x) \;\le\; M \qquad \text{for every } x \in [a,b],$$

and let $\varphi : [m,M] \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $[m,M]$
([[def-continuity-real]]). Then the composite
$\varphi \circ f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is integrable on $[a,b]$.

**The order of the hypotheses is the whole content, and it does not reverse.**
What is assumed is *continuous after integrable*: the outer function is the
continuous one. Weakening the outer function to a merely integrable $\varphi$
makes the statement **false**, and the witness is on the companion page. The
remaining variant — $\varphi$ merely integrable with $f$ *continuous* — is
neither proved nor refuted anywhere on this page, and the companion page's
witness does not bear on it, its inner function being discontinuous at every
rational. Nothing here asserts anything about that variant.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and $m \le M$, an integrable $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ with values in $[m,M]$, a continuous $\varphi : [m,M] \to \mathbb{R}$, and a real $\varepsilon > 0$. Write $h := \varphi \circ f$.

[L1] Riemann's criterion: a bounded $u$ on $[a,b]$ is integrable if and only if for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a partition $P$ with $U(u,P) - L(u,P) < \eta$ ([[thm-riemann-criterion]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L2] For a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[a,b]$ and bounded $u$: $U(u,P) - L(u,P) = \sum_{i<n}\bigl(M_i(u) - m_i(u)\bigr)\Delta_i$ with $\Delta_i > 0$ and $\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = b - a$, and $M_i(u) - m_i(u) = \omega_u(I_i) = \sup\{\,|u(x)-u(y)| : x,y \in I_i\,\}$ ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-oscillation]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L3] $[m,M]$ with $m \le M$ and $[a,b]$ are closed bounded intervals, hence compact ([[thm-heine-borel-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L4] A continuous real function on a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is bounded there ([[cor-boundedness-theorem-r]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L5] Heine-Cantor: a continuous real function on a compact $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is uniformly continuous on $K$, so for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a real $\delta_0 > 0$ with $|\varphi(s)-\varphi(t)| < \eta$ for all $s,t \in K$ with $|s-t| < \delta_0$ ([[thm-heine-cantor-r]], [[def-uniform-continuity-real]]).

[L6] Finite sums: additivity, scaling and monotonicity in the terms ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], clauses 1, 2 and 4).

[L7] Ordered-field arithmetic and the absolute value: multiplying an inequality by a nonnegative quantity and adding constants preserve it, the order is total and transitive, a positive real has a positive inverse, and $|u| \le c$ follows from $-c \le u \le c$ ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]). The nonstrict forms follow from the strict ones by adjoining the case of equality.

[L8] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a real $\eta' > 0$ with $\eta' < \eta$, for instance $\eta' = \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$; and the Archimedean property in reciprocal form ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $[m,M]$ is compact, so $\varphi$ is bounded there: fix a real $K \ge 0$ with $|\varphi(s)| \le K$ for every $s \in [m,M]$. Hence $|h(x)| \le K$ for every $x \in [a,b]$ and $h$ is bounded. [given, L3, L4, choose]

1.2 By [L5] applied on the compact $[m,M]$ with $\eta := \varepsilon$, fix a real $\delta_0 > 0$ with $|\varphi(s)-\varphi(t)| < \varepsilon$ whenever $s,t \in [m,M]$ and $|s-t| < \delta_0$; then put $\delta := \min\{\delta_0 \cdot 2^{-1},\ \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}\}$, a positive real with $\delta < \delta_0$ and $\delta < \varepsilon$. [given, L3, L5, L7, L8, choose]

2.1 So $|\varphi(s)-\varphi(t)| \le \varepsilon$ whenever $s,t \in [m,M]$ satisfy $|s-t| \le \delta$, since $\delta < \delta_0$. [step 1.2, L7]

2.2 Since $\delta > 0$, so is $\delta^{2}$, and [L1] supplies a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[a,b]$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \delta^{2}$. [step 1.2, given, L1, L7, choose]

3.1 Fix $i < n$ and write $\Omega_i := M_i(f) - m_i(f) \ge 0$. If $\Omega_i \le \delta$ then any $x,y \in I_i$ have $|f(x)-f(y)| \le \Omega_i \le \delta$ with $f(x),f(y) \in [m,M]$, so $|h(x)-h(y)| \le \varepsilon$ by step 2.1, whence $M_i(h) - m_i(h) \le \varepsilon$ by [L2]. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L2, L7]

3.2 If instead $\Omega_i > \delta$ then $\Omega_i/\delta > 1$, while $M_i(h) - m_i(h) \le 2K$ always, by [L2] and step 1.1. [step 1.1, step 2.2, L2, L7]

4.1 In both cases $\bigl(M_i(h)-m_i(h)\bigr)\Delta_i \le \varepsilon\,\Delta_i + \bigl(2K/\delta\bigr)\Omega_i\Delta_i$: in the first case the second summand is nonnegative and the first alone dominates, and in the second case $(2K/\delta)\Omega_i\Delta_i \ge 2K\Delta_i$ dominates by itself. [step 3.1, step 3.2, L7]

5.1 Summing over $i < n$ with [L6] and using $\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = b-a$ and [L2] gives $U(h,P)-L(h,P) \le \varepsilon(b-a) + (2K/\delta)\bigl(U(f,P)-L(f,P)\bigr)$. [step 4.1, L2, L6, L7]

6.1 By step 2.2 the second summand is below $(2K/\delta)\delta^{2} = 2K\delta$, and $\delta < \varepsilon$ by step 1.2, so $U(h,P)-L(h,P) < \varepsilon\,(b-a+2K)$. [step 2.2, step 5.1, L7]

7.1 Let a real $\eta > 0$ be given. Running steps 1.2 to 6.1 with $\varepsilon := \eta/(b-a+2K+1)$, a positive real since $b-a+2K+1 > 0$, produces a partition $P$ with $U(h,P)-L(h,P) < \eta\,(b-a+2K)/(b-a+2K+1) < \eta$. [step 6.1, L7, L8]

8.1 As $\eta > 0$ was arbitrary and $h$ is bounded by step 1.1, [L1] makes $h = \varphi\circ f$ integrable on $[a,b]$. [step 1.1, step 7.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Step 4.1 is what replaces the usual split of the index range.** The classical proof separates the indices into a good set $G$ and a bad set $B$ and sums over each; the finite-sum toolkit used here is that of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], stated for $\sum_{i<n}$ and carrying no clause that splits a range into a subset and its complement, so the split is carried instead by a single inequality valid at *every* index, whose two summands are exactly the two contributions. The bound obtained is the same one.

- **The hypothesis $f[\,[a,b]\,] \subseteq [m,M]$ is what makes $\varphi\circ f$ defined at all**, and $m,M$ exist because an integrable $f$ is bounded ([[def-darboux-sums]]). Taking $[m,M]$ to be any interval containing the range of $f$ is legitimate and changes nothing, since a continuous function on a larger compact interval restricts to a continuous one.

- **What the theorem does not say.** It does not say that $\varphi\circ f$ is integrable when $\varphi$ is merely integrable, and it does not say that $\int_a^b \varphi\circ f$ can be computed from $\int_a^b f$. The first is refuted on the companion page. For the second, take $\varphi(t) = t^{2}$ on $[0,1]$ with $f$ the constant $1/2$ and with $g$ the indicator of $[0,1/2]$: both are integrable with integral $1/2$, while $\int_0^1 \varphi\circ f = 1/4$ and $\int_0^1 \varphi\circ g = 1/2$, so $\int_a^b \varphi\circ f$ is not a function of $\int_a^b f$.

- **Forward reference, orientation only.** The reversal refuted on the companion page is [[cex-a-composition-of-integrable-functions-that-is-not-integrable]]; nothing above depends on it.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $[a,b]$
([[def-continuity-real]]). Then $f$ is bounded ([[def-bounded-set]]) and Riemann
integrable on $[a,b]$ ([[def-darboux-integral]]).

**The proof gives more than integrability: it gives a partition that works.** For
every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the uniform partition into $N$ parts already
satisfies $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$, as soon as $N$ is large enough that
$(b-a)/\iota(N)$ is below the $\delta$ that uniform continuity supplies for
$\varepsilon/\bigl(2(b-a)\bigr)$. Uniform continuity is exactly what makes one
$\delta$ serve all $N$ subintervals at once, and it is the only place where the
compactness of $[a,b]$ is used.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and a function $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ continuous on $[a,b]$.

[L1] $[a,b]$ is closed and bounded, hence compact ([[def-interval]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-bounded-set]], [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L2] A continuous real function on a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is bounded there ([[cor-boundedness-theorem-r]]).

[L3] Heine-Cantor: a continuous real function on a compact subset $K$ of $\mathbb{R}$ is uniformly continuous on $K$, that is, for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ with $|f(x) - f(y)| < \eta$ for all $x, y \in K$ with $|x - y| < \delta$ ([[thm-heine-cantor-r]], [[def-uniform-continuity-real]]).

[L4] For a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[a,b]$: $\Delta_i = t_{i+1} - t_i > 0$, $\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = b-a$, and the uniform partition $U_N$ into $N \ge 1$ parts has every $\Delta_i$ equal to $(b-a)/\iota(N)$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L5] $U(f,P) - L(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}(M_i - m_i)\Delta_i$ and $M_i - m_i = \sup\{|f(x)-f(y)| : x, y \in I_i\}$ for bounded $f$ ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L6] Riemann's criterion: a bounded $f$ is integrable if and only if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a partition $P$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$ ([[thm-riemann-criterion]]).

[L7] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N) < \eta$, and $\iota(N) > 0$ for $N \ge 1$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L8] Finite sums: scaling and monotonicity in the terms ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L9] Ordered-field arithmetic and the absolute value: adding a constant and multiplying by a positive quantity preserve an inequality; the order is total and transitive; $x, y \in [c,d]$ gives $|x - y| \le d - c$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-interval]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $[a,b]$ is compact by [L1], so $f$ is bounded on $[a,b]$ by [L2] and its Darboux sums and integrals are defined. [given, L1, L2]

1.2 Let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given and put $\eta := \varepsilon \cdot \bigl(2(b-a)\bigr)^{-1}$, a positive real by [L9] since $b - a > 0$. [given, L9]

2.1 By [L3] applied to the compact set $[a,b]$ with this $\eta$, fix a real $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(x) - f(y)| < \eta$ for all $x, y \in [a,b]$ with $|x - y| < \delta$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1, L3, choose]

3.1 By [L7] fix a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N) < \delta \cdot (b-a)^{-1}$, and put $P := U_N = (N,t)$, the uniform partition of $[a,b]$ into $N$ parts. Then every $\Delta_i$ equals $(b-a)/\iota(N) < \delta$ by [L4] and [L9]. [step 2.1, L4, L7, L9, choose]

4.1 For each $i < N$ and all $x, y \in I_i = [t_i, t_{i+1}]$ one has $|x-y| \le \Delta_i < \delta$ by [L9], hence $|f(x) - f(y)| < \eta$ by step 2.1. So $\eta$ is an upper bound of the set $\{|f(x)-f(y)| : x,y \in I_i\}$, and therefore $M_i - m_i \le \eta$ by [L5]. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L5, L9]

5.1 Consequently $U(f,P) - L(f,P) = \sum_{i<N}(M_i - m_i)\Delta_i \le \sum_{i<N}\eta\,\Delta_i = \eta\,(b-a) = \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} < \varepsilon$, using [L5], step 4.1, $\Delta_i > 0$, [L8], [L4] and [L9]. [step 4.1, L4, L5, L8, L9]

6.1 Since the real $\varepsilon > 0$ of step 1.2 was arbitrary and step 5.1 produced a partition with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$, criterion [L6] applies and $f$ is Riemann integrable on $[a,b]$; it is bounded by step 1.1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 5.1, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- **Continuity is sufficient and very far from necessary.** A monotone function may have infinitely many discontinuities and is still integrable ([[thm-monotone-implies-integrable]]); Thomae's function is discontinuous at every rational and integrable ([[cor-countably-many-discontinuities-integrable]]); and the indicator of the Cantor set is discontinuous at uncountably many points and integrable. The exact frontier is [[thm-lebesgue-criterion]].

- **Where compactness enters, and what it buys.** Only through [L1], and then twice: [[cor-boundedness-theorem-r]] to know that the Darboux sums exist at all, and [[thm-heine-cantor-r]] to get one $\delta$ for the whole interval. On a non-compact interval both can fail: $x \mapsto 1/x$ is continuous on $(0,1)$ and unbounded there, so it has no Darboux sums at all.

- **The choice cost is inherited, not incurred.** Nothing in the proof above selects anything from an infinite family; the single use of countable choice behind this theorem sits inside [[thm-heine-cantor-r]], which names it in its own statement. See [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals, let $G : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be differentiable at every
point of $[a,b]$ as a function on $[a,b]$ ([[def-derivative]]; at $a$ and $b$
this is the one-sided derivative), let $f := G'$, and suppose $f$ is integrable
on $[a,b]$ ([[def-darboux-integral]]). Then

$$\int_a^b f \;=\; G(b) - G(a) .$$

**Both hypotheses are needed and neither is removable.** A function may be
differentiable everywhere with $G'$ not integrable — then the left-hand side does
not exist (an everywhere differentiable function with unbounded derivative) — and an
integrable $f$ need not be the derivative of anything
(the sign function); both witnesses are on the
companion page.

**No continuity of $f$ is assumed**, which is what makes this the working form:
the theorem evaluates $\int_a^b f$ for every integrable derivative, not only for
continuous integrands.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, a function $G : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ differentiable at every point of $[a,b]$, $f := G'$ integrable on $[a,b]$, and a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[a,b]$.

[L1] For a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[a,b]$: $t_0 = a$, $t_n = b$, $t_i < t_{i+1}$ for $i < n$, $\Delta_i = t_{i+1}-t_i > 0$, and $I_i = [t_i,t_{i+1}] \subseteq [a,b]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-interval]]).

[L2] $L(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}m_i\Delta_i$ and $U(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}M_i\Delta_i$ with $m_i = \inf f[I_i]$ and $M_i = \sup f[I_i]$, so $m_i \le f(\xi) \le M_i$ for every $\xi \in I_i$ ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L3] $\underline{\int_a^b} f = \sup_P L(f,P)$ and $\overline{\int_a^b} f = \inf_P U(f,P)$, and $f$ integrable means the two agree, their common value being $\int_a^b f$ ([[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L4] Mean value theorem: if $u$ is continuous on $[p,q]$ with $p<q$ and differentiable at every point of $(p,q)$, there is $\xi \in (p,q)$ with $u(q)-u(p) = u'(\xi)(q-p)$ ([[cor-mean-value-theorem]]).

[L5] A function differentiable at a point is continuous there, and the restriction of a differentiable function to a subinterval is differentiable with the same derivative at every point of that subinterval which is a limit point of it ([[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]], [[def-derivative]], [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L6] Finite sums: telescoping $\sum_{i<n}(c_{i+1}-c_i) = c_n - c_0$, and monotonicity in the terms ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], clauses 4 and 5).

[L7] Ordered-field arithmetic: multiplying an inequality by a positive real preserves it, the order is total and transitive, and a number that is an upper bound of a set and also a lower bound of another set lies between their supremum and infimum ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $P = (n,t)$ be an arbitrary partition of $[a,b]$ and let $i < n$. The restriction of $G$ to $I_i = [t_i,t_{i+1}]$ is continuous on $I_i$ and differentiable at every point of $(t_i,t_{i+1})$, with the same derivative $f$ there, by [L5] and [L1]. [given, L1, L5]

2.1 By [L4] applied on $I_i$ there is $\xi_i \in (t_i,t_{i+1})$ with $G(t_{i+1}) - G(t_i) = f(\xi_i)\,\Delta_i$; since $\xi_i \in I_i$ and $\Delta_i > 0$, [L2] gives $m_i\Delta_i \le G(t_{i+1})-G(t_i) \le M_i\Delta_i$. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L4, L7]

3.1 Step 2.1 holds for every $i < n$, so monotonicity of finite sums applies to the three families and gives $\sum_{i<n}m_i\Delta_i \le \sum_{i<n}\bigl(G(t_{i+1})-G(t_i)\bigr) \le \sum_{i<n}M_i\Delta_i$. [step 2.1, L6]

4.1 The middle sum telescopes to $G(t_n) - G(t_0) = G(b) - G(a)$ by [L6] and [L1], so $L(f,P) \le G(b)-G(a) \le U(f,P)$ by [L2]. [step 3.1, L1, L2, L6]

5.1 Step 4.1 holds for **every** partition $P$, so $G(b)-G(a)$ is an upper bound of the set of lower sums and a lower bound of the set of upper sums; hence $\underline{\int_a^b} f \le G(b)-G(a) \le \overline{\int_a^b} f$ by [L3] and [L7]. [step 4.1, L3, L7]

6.1 Since $f$ is integrable the two integrals coincide with $\int_a^b f$, so $\int_a^b f = G(b)-G(a)$. [step 5.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **No choice principle is spent, and no sequence of tags is ever formed.** The usual proof selects one $\xi_i$ per subinterval and assembles the Riemann sum $\sum_i f(\xi_i)\Delta_i$, which is a choice from finitely many nonempty sets. The proof above never forms that family: step 2.1 proves, for an arbitrary fixed $i$, the *inequality* $m_i\Delta_i \le G(t_{i+1})-G(t_i) \le M_i\Delta_i$, which is a universally quantified statement about $i$ and needs no selection, and step 3.1 then sums the inequality. The telescoping identity supplies the middle term without any tags at all.

- **The hypothesis is differentiability at every point of the closed interval.** It is not enough to be differentiable on $(a,b)$ and continuous on $[a,b]$ in the argument as written, because step 2.1 uses the derivative only on open subintervals but the definition $f = G'$ has to name a function on all of $[a,b]$ for $\int_a^b f$ to mean anything. Changing $f$ at the two endpoints changes neither its integrability nor its integral ([[lem-changing-a-function-at-finitely-many-points]]), so the reader who prefers the weaker hypothesis loses nothing.

- **This is the half of the fundamental theorem that computes.** The other half, [[thm-ftc-first-part]], produces a primitive; this one evaluates an integral once a primitive is known, and it is the tool the companion page reaches for whenever a primitive is available. Where no primitive is at hand the companion page computes instead by splitting at a jump and using the integral of a constant; no claim is made here about how many of its computations take which route.

- **Forward references, orientation only.** The two witnesses showing neither hypothesis is removable are [[cex-a-function-with-a-primitive-that-is-not-integrable]] and [[cex-an-integrable-function-with-no-primitive]] on the companion page; nothing above depends on either.
