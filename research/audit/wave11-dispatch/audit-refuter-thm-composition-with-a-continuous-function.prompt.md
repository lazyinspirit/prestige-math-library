## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` Statement or counterexample, actively search for a
counterexample to the public claim or a failure in the witness. A false public
claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or materially
inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is nonfatal.

Return no more than 450 words, exactly in this shape:

## Statement

Let $a < b$ and $m \le M$ be reals, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]) with

$$m \;\le\; f(x) \;\le\; M \qquad \text{for every } x \in [a,b],$$

and let $\varphi : [m,M] \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $[m,M]$
([[def-continuity-real]]). Then the composite
$\varphi \circ f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is integrable on $[a,b]$.

**The order of the hypotheses is the whole content, and it does not reverse.**
What is assumed is *continuous after integrable*: the outer function is the
continuous one. Weakening the outer function to a merely integrable $\varphi$
makes the statement **false**, and the witness is on the companion page. The
remaining variant — $\varphi$ merely integrable with $f$ *continuous* — is
neither proved nor refuted anywhere on this page, and the companion page's
witness does not bear on it, its inner function being discontinuous at every
rational. Nothing here asserts anything about that variant.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and $m \le M$, an integrable $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ with values in $[m,M]$, a continuous $\varphi : [m,M] \to \mathbb{R}$, and a real $\varepsilon > 0$. Write $h := \varphi \circ f$.

[L1] Riemann's criterion: a bounded $u$ on $[a,b]$ is integrable if and only if for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a partition $P$ with $U(u,P) - L(u,P) < \eta$ ([[thm-riemann-criterion]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L2] For a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[a,b]$ and bounded $u$: $U(u,P) - L(u,P) = \sum_{i<n}\bigl(M_i(u) - m_i(u)\bigr)\Delta_i$ with $\Delta_i > 0$ and $\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = b - a$, and $M_i(u) - m_i(u) = \omega_u(I_i) = \sup\{\,|u(x)-u(y)| : x,y \in I_i\,\}$ ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-oscillation]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L3] $[m,M]$ with $m \le M$ and $[a,b]$ are closed bounded intervals, hence compact ([[thm-heine-borel-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L4] A continuous real function on a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is bounded there ([[cor-boundedness-theorem-r]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L5] Heine-Cantor: a continuous real function on a compact $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is uniformly continuous on $K$, so for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a real $\delta_0 > 0$ with $|\varphi(s)-\varphi(t)| < \eta$ for all $s,t \in K$ with $|s-t| < \delta_0$ ([[thm-heine-cantor-r]], [[def-uniform-continuity-real]]).

[L6] Finite sums: additivity, scaling and monotonicity in the terms ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], clauses 1, 2 and 4).

[L7] Ordered-field arithmetic and the absolute value: multiplying an inequality by a nonnegative quantity and adding constants preserve it, the order is total and transitive, a positive real has a positive inverse, and $|u| \le c$ follows from $-c \le u \le c$ ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]). The nonstrict forms follow from the strict ones by adjoining the case of equality.

[L8] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a real $\eta' > 0$ with $\eta' < \eta$, for instance $\eta' = \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$; and the Archimedean property in reciprocal form ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $[m,M]$ is compact, so $\varphi$ is bounded there: fix a real $K \ge 0$ with $|\varphi(s)| \le K$ for every $s \in [m,M]$. Hence $|h(x)| \le K$ for every $x \in [a,b]$ and $h$ is bounded. [given, L3, L4, choose]

1.2 By [L5] applied on the compact $[m,M]$ with $\eta := \varepsilon$, fix a real $\delta_0 > 0$ with $|\varphi(s)-\varphi(t)| < \varepsilon$ whenever $s,t \in [m,M]$ and $|s-t| < \delta_0$; then put $\delta := \min\{\delta_0 \cdot 2^{-1},\ \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}\}$, a positive real with $\delta < \delta_0$ and $\delta < \varepsilon$. [given, L3, L5, L7, L8, choose]

2.1 So $|\varphi(s)-\varphi(t)| \le \varepsilon$ whenever $s,t \in [m,M]$ satisfy $|s-t| \le \delta$, since $\delta < \delta_0$. [step 1.2, L7]

2.2 Since $\delta > 0$, so is $\delta^{2}$, and [L1] supplies a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[a,b]$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \delta^{2}$. [step 1.2, given, L1, L7, choose]

3.1 Fix $i < n$ and write $\Omega_i := M_i(f) - m_i(f) \ge 0$. If $\Omega_i \le \delta$ then any $x,y \in I_i$ have $|f(x)-f(y)| \le \Omega_i \le \delta$ with $f(x),f(y) \in [m,M]$, so $|h(x)-h(y)| \le \varepsilon$ by step 2.1, whence $M_i(h) - m_i(h) \le \varepsilon$ by [L2]. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L2, L7]

3.2 If instead $\Omega_i > \delta$ then $\Omega_i/\delta > 1$, while $M_i(h) - m_i(h) \le 2K$ always, by [L2] and step 1.1. [step 1.1, step 2.2, L2, L7]

4.1 In both cases $\bigl(M_i(h)-m_i(h)\bigr)\Delta_i \le \varepsilon\,\Delta_i + \bigl(2K/\delta\bigr)\Omega_i\Delta_i$: in the first case the second summand is nonnegative and the first alone dominates, and in the second case $(2K/\delta)\Omega_i\Delta_i \ge 2K\Delta_i$ dominates by itself. [step 3.1, step 3.2, L7]

5.1 Summing over $i < n$ with [L6] and using $\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = b-a$ and [L2] gives $U(h,P)-L(h,P) \le \varepsilon(b-a) + (2K/\delta)\bigl(U(f,P)-L(f,P)\bigr)$. [step 4.1, L2, L6, L7]

6.1 By step 2.2 the second summand is below $(2K/\delta)\delta^{2} = 2K\delta$, and $\delta < \varepsilon$ by step 1.2, so $U(h,P)-L(h,P) < \varepsilon\,(b-a+2K)$. [step 2.2, step 5.1, L7]

7.1 Let a real $\eta > 0$ be given. Running steps 1.2 to 6.1 with $\varepsilon := \eta/(b-a+2K+1)$, a positive real since $b-a+2K+1 > 0$, produces a partition $P$ with $U(h,P)-L(h,P) < \eta\,(b-a+2K)/(b-a+2K+1) < \eta$. [step 6.1, L7, L8]

8.1 As $\eta > 0$ was arbitrary and $h$ is bounded by step 1.1, [L1] makes $h = \varphi\circ f$ integrable on $[a,b]$. [step 1.1, step 7.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Step 4.1 is what replaces the usual split of the index range.** The classical proof separates the indices into a good set $G$ and a bad set $B$ and sums over each; the finite-sum toolkit used here is that of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], stated for $\sum_{i<n}$ and carrying no clause that splits a range into a subset and its complement, so the split is carried instead by a single inequality valid at *every* index, whose two summands are exactly the two contributions. The bound obtained is the same one.

- **The hypothesis $f[\,[a,b]\,] \subseteq [m,M]$ is what makes $\varphi\circ f$ defined at all**, and $m,M$ exist because an integrable $f$ is bounded ([[def-darboux-sums]]). Taking $[m,M]$ to be any interval containing the range of $f$ is legitimate and changes nothing, since a continuous function on a larger compact interval restricts to a continuous one.

- **What the theorem does not say.** It does not say that $\varphi\circ f$ is integrable when $\varphi$ is merely integrable, and it does not say that $\int_a^b \varphi\circ f$ can be computed from $\int_a^b f$. The first is refuted on the companion page. For the second, take $\varphi(t) = t^{2}$ on $[0,1]$ with $f$ the constant $1/2$ and with $g$ the indicator of $[0,1/2]$: both are integrable with integral $1/2$, while $\int_0^1 \varphi\circ f = 1/4$ and $\int_0^1 \varphi\circ g = 1/2$, so $\int_a^b \varphi\circ f$ is not a function of $\int_a^b f$.

- **Forward reference, orientation only.** The reversal refuted on the companion page is [[cex-a-composition-of-integrable-functions-that-is-not-integrable]]; nothing above depends on it.

For $i = 0$ both equal $a$. Suppose $t_j = t'_j$\nfor all $j \\le i$ and $i + 1 \\le \\min\\{n,n'\\}$. The set\n$S := \\{\\, x \\in \\operatorname{pts}(P) : x > t_i \\,\\}$ has $t_{i+1}$ as its least\nelement: $t_{i+1} \\in S$, and any $x \\in S$ is $t_j$ for some $j \\le n$ with\n$t_j > t_i$, which forces $j > i$ because $t$ is increasing on indices $\\le n$,\nhence $j \\ge i+1$ and $x = t_j \\ge t_{i+1}$. The same argument in $P'$ makes\n$t'_{i+1}$ the least element of\n$\\{\\, x \\in \\operatorname{pts}(P') : x > t'_i \\,\\}$, which is the same set $S$,\nsince the point sets agree and $t'_i = t_i$. A set has at most one least element\n([[def-max-min]]), so $t_{i+1} = t'_{i+1}$.\n\nSecond, $n = n'$. If $n < n'$ then $t'_n = t_n = b$ by the previous paragraph,\nwhile $t'_n < t'_{n'} = b$ because $t'$ is increasing on indices $\\le n'$ and\n$n < n'$; that is impossible. Exchanging the roles of $P$ and $P'$ rules out\n$n' < n$. $\\square$\n\nSo the map $P \\mapsto \\operatorname{pts}(P)$ is injective, and a partition may be\nnamed by its point set whenever one is exhibited.\n\n### Inserting a point\n\nLet $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ and let $c \\in [a,b]$. Define a\npartition $P + c$ of $[a,b]$ as follows.\n\n- If $c \\in \\operatorname{pts}(P)$, put $P + c := P$.\n- Otherwise $c \\ne a$ and $c \\ne b$, so $a < c < b$. The set\n  $T := \\{\\, t_i : i \\le n \\text{ and } t_i < c \\,\\}$ is a nonempty finite set of\n  reals, nonempty because $t_0 = a < c$, so it has a maximum\n  ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]); let $i_0 \\le n$ be the unique index with\n  $t_{i_0} = \\max T$, unique because $t$ is injective on indices $\\le n$. Then\n  $i_0 < n$, since $t_n = b > c$ puts $t_n \\notin T$; and\n  $$t_{i_0} \\;<\\; c \\;<\\; t_{i_0+1},$$\n  the right inequality because $t_{i_0+1} \\ne c$ (as $c \\notin \\operatorname{pts}(P)$)\n  and $t_{i_0+1} < c$ would put $t_{i_0+1} \\in T$ with $t_{i_0+1} > t_{i_0} = \\max T$.\n  Put $P + c := (n+1, s)$ with\n  $$s_i := t_i \\ (i \\le i_0), \\qquad s_{i_0+1} := c, \\qquad s_i := t_{i-1} \\ (i_0 + 2 \\le i \\le n+1), \\qquad s_k := b \\ (k \\ge n+1).$$\n\nIn both cases $P + c$ is a partition of $[a,b]$ and\n\n$$\\operatorname{pts}(P + c) \\;=\\; \\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\{c\\}, \\qquad \\|P+c\\| \\;\\le\\; \\|P\\| .$$\n\nThe displayed identity is immediate from the two cases. For the mesh: in the\nfirst case nothing changes; in the second the list of subinterval lengths of\n$P + c$ is that of $P$ with $\\Delta_{i_0}$ replaced by the two numbers\n$c - t_{i_0}$ and $t_{i_0+1} - c$, each of which is smaller than\n$\\Delta_{i_0} = (c - t_{i_0}) + (t_{i_0+1} - c)$ because the other is positive.\nSo every length of $P + c$ is at most a length of $P$, and the maximum cannot\nincrease. Finally the index count grows by exactly $1$ in the second case and\nnot at all in the first.\n\n### Refinement and the common refinement\n\n$P'$ **refines** $P$, and is a **refinement** of $P$, when\n\n$$\\operatorname{pts}(P) \\;\\subseteq\\; \\operatorname{pts}(P') .$$\n\nLet $P = (n,t)$ and $Q = (m,s)$ be partitions of $[a,b]$. Applying the recursion\ntheorem ([[thm-recursion]]) to the set $\\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$,\nwhere $\\mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$ is the set of partitions of $[a,b]$, with starting\nelement $(0, P)$ and the map $(j, R) \\mapsto (j+1,\\ R + s_j)$ — legitimate\nbecause $s_j \\in [a,b]$ for every $j \\in \\mathbb{N}$ — gives a unique family\n$(R_j)_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ of partitions with $R_0 = P$ and $R_{j+1} = R_j + s_j$.\nThe **common refinement** of $P$ and $Q$ is\n\n$$P \\vee Q \\;:=\\; R_{m+1} .$$\n\n**Its point set is the union.** By induction on $j$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]),\n$\\operatorname{pts}(R_j) = \\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\{\\, s_l : l < j \\,\\}$;\ntaking $j = m+1$ gives\n\n$$\\operatorname{pts}(P \\vee Q) \\;=\\; \\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\operatorname{pts}(Q).$$\n\nHence $P \\vee Q$ refines both $P$ and $Q$; by the uniqueness claim above it is\nthe **only** partition with that point set, so $P \\vee Q = Q \\vee P$, and\n\n$$P' \\text{ refines } P \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad P \\vee P' = P' ,$$\n\nsince then $\\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\operatorname{pts}(P') =\n\\operatorname{pts}(P')$.\n\n**Two size bounds, both used later.** Writing $n_R$ for the first component of a\npartition $R$:\n\n$$\\|P \\vee Q\\| \\;\\le\\; \\|P\\|, \\qquad n_{P \\vee Q} \\;\\le\\; n_P + n_Q - 1 .$$\n\nThe first is the mesh bound above applied $m+1$ times. For the second, each\ninsertion raises the index count by at most $1$, and the two insertions of\n$s_0 = a$ and $s_m = b$ raise it by $0$, since $a$ and $b$ already lie in\n$\\operatorname{pts}(P)$ and hence in $\\operatorname{pts}(R_j)$ for every $j$; so\nat most $m - 1$ of the $m+1$ insertions increase it.\n\n### The index map of a refinement\n\nLet $P' = (n',t')$ refine $P = (n,t)$. For each $i \\le n$ the point $t_i$ lies in\n$\\operatorname{pts}(P')$, so there is exactly one $\\varphi(i) \\le n'$ with\n$t'_{\\varphi(i)} = t_i$, uniqueness because $t'$ is injective on indices $\\le n'$.\nThe resulting map $\\varphi$ satisfies\n\n$$\\varphi(0) = 0, \\qquad \\varphi(n) = n', \\qquad \\varphi(i) < \\varphi(i+1) \\ \\ (i < n),$$\n\nthe first two because $t'_0 = a = t_0$ and $t'_{n'} = b = t_n$ together with\ninjectivity, and the third because $t_i < t_{i+1}$ and $t'$ is increasing on\nindices $\\le n'$. In particular $n \\le n'$. Moreover, for $i < n$ and\n$\\varphi(i) \\le j < \\varphi(i+1)$,\n\n$$I'_j \\;=\\; [\\,t'_j,\\ t'_{j+1}\\,] \\;\\subseteq\\; [\\,t_i,\\ t_{i+1}\\,] \\;=\\; I_i ,$$\n\nbecause $t_i = t'_{\\varphi(i)} \\le t'_j$ and $t'_{j+1} \\le t'_{\\varphi(i+1)} = t_{i+1}$.\n\n**The blocks are counted by telescoping.** By clause 5 of\n[[lem-finite-sum-laws]],\n$\\sum_{i<n}\\big(\\varphi(i+1) - \\varphi(i)\\big) = \\varphi(n) - \\varphi(0) = n'$,\nso, subtracting $\\sum_{i<n} 1 = n$,\n\n$$\\sum_{i<n} \\big(\\varphi(i+1) - \\varphi(i) - 1\\big) \\;=\\; n' - n ,$$\n\na sum of $n$ nonnegative integers, one for each block, which vanishes exactly at\nthe blocks consisting of a single index.

## Statement refuted

**False claim:** if $f : [a,b] \to [m,M]$ is Riemann integrable and
$\varphi : [m,M] \to \mathbb{R}$ is Riemann integrable, then $\varphi\circ f$ is
Riemann integrable on $[a,b]$.

That is [[thm-composition-with-a-continuous-function]] with "continuous"
weakened to "integrable" on the outer function, and it is false. On $[0,1]$ take
$f := t$, Thomae's function ([[def-dirichlet-and-thomae-functions]]), whose
values lie in $[0,1]$, and

$$\varphi : [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad \varphi(u) \;:=\; \begin{cases} 0 & u = 0, \\ 1 & 0 < u \le 1. \end{cases}$$

Both are Riemann integrable, $t$ because its discontinuity set is at most
countable and $\varphi$ because it is nondecreasing. But

$$\varphi \circ t \;=\; \mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}} \quad \text{on } [0,1] ,$$

the Dirichlet function, which is not Riemann integrable.

**Exactly one hypothesis of the composition theorem fails, and it is named:**
$\varphi$ is not continuous, being discontinuous at $0$. The theorem's hypothesis
is *continuous after integrable*; here the outer function is merely integrable,
and that is not enough.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Thomae's function $t$ on $[0,1]$, with $t(x) = 1/\iota(q(x))$ at a rational $x$ of least denominator $q(x) \ge 1$ and $t(x) = 0$ at an irrational $x$, and the function $\varphi$ above.

[L1] $0 \le t(x) \le 1$ for every $x$, and $t(x) > 0$ exactly at the rational $x$, since $\iota(q(x)) \ge 1 > 0$ ([[def-dirichlet-and-thomae-functions]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] $t$ is continuous at every irrational and discontinuous at every rational, and $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ is continuous at no real ([[thm-dirichlet-and-thomae-continuity-sets]], claims 1 and 3, [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L3] $\mathbb{Q}$ is countably infinite and every subset of an at most countable set is at most countable ([[thm-rationals-countable]], [[lem-subset-of-countable]], [[def-countable]]).

[L4] A bounded function on $[p,q]$ whose set of discontinuities is at most countable is Riemann integrable there ([[cor-countably-many-discontinuities-integrable]], [[def-bounded-set]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L5] A monotone function on a closed bounded interval with distinct endpoints is bounded and integrable there ([[thm-monotone-implies-integrable]], [[def-monotone-function]]).

[L6] A bounded function on $[p,q]$ is integrable if and only if its discontinuity set has measure zero; a nondegenerate interval does not have measure zero; an at most countable set does ([[thm-lebesgue-criterion]], [[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]], [[lem-countable-sets-are-null]], [[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

[L7] Ordered-field arithmetic and intervals: the order is total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-interval]]).

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $t$ is bounded on $[0,1]$ with values in $[0,1]$, by [L1]. [given, L1]

1.2 The set of discontinuities of $t$ in $[0,1]$ is $\mathbb{Q}\cap[0,1]$ by [L2], which is at most countable by [L3]. [L2, L3]

1.3 $\varphi$ is nondecreasing on $[0,1]$: for $u \le v$ the only case not giving $\varphi(u) = \varphi(v)$ is $u = 0 < v$, where $\varphi(u) = 0 < 1 = \varphi(v)$. So $\varphi$ is bounded and integrable on $[0,1]$ by [L5]. [given, L5, L7]

2.1 Hence $t$ is Riemann integrable on $[0,1]$ by [L4]. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L4]

2.2 For $x \in [0,1]$: if $x$ is rational then $t(x) > 0$ by [L1], so $\varphi(t(x)) = 1$; if $x$ is irrational then $t(x) = 0$, so $\varphi(t(x)) = 0$. Hence $\varphi\circ t$ agrees with $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ at every point of $[0,1]$. [step 1.1, given, L1]

3.1 $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ is bounded on $[0,1]$ and continuous at no point of it by [L2], so its discontinuity set is $[0,1]$, which does not have measure zero by [L6]; therefore $\varphi\circ t$ is not Riemann integrable on $[0,1]$ by [L6]. [step 2.2, L2, L6]

4.1 So $t$ and $\varphi$ are integrable while $\varphi\circ t$ is not, and the claim is false. The hypothesis of [[thm-composition-with-a-continuous-function]] that fails here is the continuity of the outer function: $\varphi$ is discontinuous at $0$, since $\varphi(0) = 0$ while $\varphi(u) = 1$ for every $u \in (0,1]$ and every neighbourhood of $0$ in $[0,1]$ contains such a $u$. [step 2.1, step 1.3, step 3.1, L7] ∎

## Remarks

- **The order of composition is the whole point.** The published theorem is *continuous after integrable*, and it is true; the reversal, *integrable after integrable*, is refuted here. A reader who remembers only "composition preserves integrability" will get this wrong in one direction out of two, and the direction that fails is the one this item names.

- **Nothing is claimed about the inner function being continuous.** If $f$ is continuous and $\varphi$ merely integrable, the composite may still fail to be integrable; that case is not covered above and no claim is made about it here.

- **Thomae is the right inner function because its positivity set is exactly $\mathbb{Q}$.** Any integrable $f$ that is positive exactly on a dense set of measure zero and zero elsewhere would do; Thomae is the published one, and [[thm-dirichlet-and-thomae-continuity-sets]] is what supplies its continuity set without recomputing it.

## Statement

Let $F$ be a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and let
$\varepsilon \in F$ with $\varepsilon > 0$. Then there is a natural number
$n \ge 1$ such that

$$\frac{1}{n \cdot 1_F} < \varepsilon ,$$

where $n \cdot 1_F$ is the canonical natural of $F$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]]) and
$1/(n \cdot 1_F)$ is its multiplicative inverse ([[def-field]]). As is standard
we abbreviate $n \cdot 1_F$ to $n$ and write the conclusion $1/n < \varepsilon$.

This is the **reciprocal form** of the Archimedean property.
[[thm-of-archimedean]] on its own delivers only the assertion that the canonical
naturals are cofinal, $x < n \cdot 1_F$; the form actually used in analysis, that
the reciprocals of the naturals get below every positive bound, is the statement
above, and it is recorded separately so that no proof has to reconstruct the
inversion step in passing.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $F$ and an element $\varepsilon \in F$ with $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] Archimedean property: for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Inverses and order: if $a > 0$ then $a^{-1} > 0$, and if $0 < a < b$ then $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Field arithmetic: an element $a$ with $a > 0$ is nonzero by trichotomy, hence has a multiplicative inverse $a^{-1}$, and $(a^{-1})^{-1} = a$ ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Since $\varepsilon > 0$, trichotomy gives $\varepsilon \ne 0$, so $\varepsilon^{-1}$ exists, and $\varepsilon^{-1} > 0$. [given, L2, L3]

2.1 Apply [L1] to $x = \varepsilon^{-1}$: fix a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $\varepsilon^{-1} < n \cdot 1_F$. [step 1.1, L1, choose]

3.1 Chaining the two displayed inequalities gives $0 < \varepsilon^{-1} < n \cdot 1_F$; in particular $n \cdot 1_F > 0$, so $n \cdot 1_F \ne 0$ and $1/(n \cdot 1_F)$ is defined. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L3]

4.1 Apply the second claim of [L2] with $a = \varepsilon^{-1}$ and $b = n \cdot 1_F$: $0 < (n \cdot 1_F)^{-1} < (\varepsilon^{-1})^{-1}$. [step 3.1, L2]

5.1 By [L3], $(\varepsilon^{-1})^{-1} = \varepsilon$, so the natural number $n \ge 1$ fixed in step 2.1 satisfies $1/(n \cdot 1_F) < \varepsilon$, which is the assertion. [step 4.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Monotonicity gives the eventual form for free.** If $m \ge n \ge 1$ then
  $m \cdot 1_F \ge n \cdot 1_F > 0$, because $k \mapsto k \cdot 1_F$ is strictly
  increasing on the naturals $\ge 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]), and so
  $1/(m \cdot 1_F) \le 1/(n \cdot 1_F) < \varepsilon$ by [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]
  again. So the corollary yields not merely one index but a threshold: every
  $m \ge n$ satisfies $1/m < \varepsilon$. That one extra line is what a
  convergence proof needs, and it is left to the caller rather than folded into
  the statement, because the caller usually has a threshold of its own to combine
  it with.

- **Completeness is used only through [[thm-of-archimedean]].** Nothing here
  needs the least-upper-bound property directly. The corollary therefore holds
  verbatim in any Archimedean ordered field, in particular in $\mathbb{Q}$, and
  it fails in a non-Archimedean ordered field, where an infinitesimal
  $\varepsilon > 0$ is below every $1/n$ by construction.

- The equivalence is exact: the reciprocal form implies the cofinal form back
  again, since given $x > 0$ one applies it to $\varepsilon = 1/x$. The two are
  the same property written on the two sides of the inversion, and only the
  direction proved above is used in this library.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $A$
([[def-continuity-real]]) and let $K \subseteq A$ be compact
([[def-open-cover-r]]). Then $f$ is **bounded on $K$**: there is a real
$M \ge 0$ with

$$|f(x)| \le M \qquad \text{for every } x \in K .$$

Equivalently, $f[K]$ is a bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-bounded-set]]).

**The hypothesis is compactness of $K$, not of $A$**, and it cannot be relaxed
to boundedness of $K$ or to closedness of $K$ alone: the identity is unbounded
on the closed set $[0,\infty)$, and $x \mapsto 1/x$ is unbounded on the bounded
set $(0,1)$. The general statement of that is
[[thm-compactness-is-necessary-for-evt-and-uniform-continuity]], later on this
page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ continuous on $A$, and a compact set $K \subseteq A$.

[L1] The image $f[K]$ is compact ([[thm-continuous-image-of-a-compact-set-r]], [[def-continuity-real]], [[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L2] A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]]).

[L3] A set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is bounded when there are reals $\ell, u$ with $\ell \le s \le u$ for every $s \in S$ ([[def-bounded-set]]).

[L4] A nonempty finite set of reals has a maximum ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]), and the order of $\mathbb{R}$ is total ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] Absolute value: $|u| \ge 0$; $|u| = u$ when $u \ge 0$ and $|u| = -u$ when $u \le 0$; and $t \le |t|$ for every real $t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L1] the set $f[K]$ is compact, and by [L2] it is therefore closed and bounded. [L1, L2]

2.1 By [L3] fix reals $\ell$ and $u$ with $\ell \le z \le u$ for every $z \in f[K]$, and put $M := \max\{\,|\ell|,\ |u|\,\}$, which exists by [L4] and satisfies $M \ge 0$ by [L5]. [step 1.1, L3, L4, L5, choose]

3.1 Let $x \in K$ and put $z := f(x) \in f[K]$, so $\ell \le z \le u$. If $z \ge 0$ then $|z| = z \le u \le |u| \le M$; if $z < 0$ then $|z| = -z \le -\ell \le |\ell| \le M$, using $\ell \le z$ and $-\ell \le |{-\ell}| = |\ell|$. In both cases $|f(x)| \le M$. [step 2.1, L4, L5]

4.1 So $|f(x)| \le M$ for every $x \in K$, with $M \ge 0$ a real; equivalently $f[K]$ is bounded, which is what step 1.1 already recorded. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Boundedness is the weak half of the extreme value theorem.** What compactness gives in addition is that the two bounds are *attained*, which is [[thm-extreme-value-r]]; the supremum of $f[K]$ exists as soon as $f[K]$ is nonempty and bounded above, and the work is entirely in showing that it belongs to $f[K]$.

- **Boundedness of the domain is not what is used.** The proof never looks at $K$ after the first line: the whole content is that the *image* is compact, hence bounded. That is why the same one-line argument gives boundedness of a continuous function on any compact set, however complicated.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ denotes the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a subset of it.

The notions **upper bound** and **bounded above** are already fixed by
[[def-complete-ordered-field]] and are only recalled here, never redefined:
$u \in \mathbb{R}$ is an *upper bound* of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$, and
$S$ is *bounded above* if it has at least one upper bound. The dual notions are:

- $\ell \in \mathbb{R}$ is a **lower bound** of $S$ if $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.
- $S$ is **bounded below** if it has at least one lower bound.
- $S$ is **bounded** if it is both bounded above and bounded below, that is, if
  there are $\ell, u \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\ell \le s \le u$ for every $s \in S$.

## Remarks

- A bound is an element of $\mathbb{R}$ and is not required to lie in $S$. A
  bound that does lie in $S$ is a maximum or a minimum ([[def-max-min]]), and
  that is a strictly stronger condition ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Bounds come in half-lines: if $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$ then so is every
  $\ell'' \le \ell$, and if $u$ is an upper bound then so is every $u'' \ge u$.
  Consequently a set that has one bound of a given kind has infinitely many, and
  the interesting question is whether the collection of them has a best element,
  which is what a supremum ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) or an infimum
  ([[def-infimum]]) is.
- Bounded above and bounded below are independent conditions. The set
  $A = \{\, n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} : n \ge 1 \,\}$ of canonical naturals of
  $\mathbb{R}$ is bounded below by $0$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]) and is not
  bounded above ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); its reflection $-A$ is bounded above
  and not bounded below ([[lem-reflection]]).
- The empty set is bounded, and vacuously so: every real number is both an upper
  bound and a lower bound of $\emptyset$, since the defining condition quantifies
  over no elements. Having bounds is therefore much weaker than having a least
  upper bound or a greatest lower bound ([[fs-every-set-has-sup]]).

## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq F$.

- $u \in F$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$; $S$ is
  **bounded above** if it has an upper bound.
- $u \in F$ is a **least upper bound** (or **supremum**, $\sup S$) of $S$ if $u$
  is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le u'$ for every upper bound $u'$ of $S$.

$F$ is a **complete ordered field** (equivalently, $F$ has the
**least-upper-bound property**, or is **Dedekind complete**) if every nonempty
$S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$.

## Remarks

- A least upper bound, if it exists, is unique (two least upper bounds are each
  $\le$ the other, so equal by antisymmetry of the order).
- Applying the property to $\{-s : s \in S\}$ yields the dual **greatest lower
  bound** (infimum) property, so the two are equivalent.
- The Dedekind-cut reals have this property by construction
  ([[thm-dedekind-complete]]); the Cauchy-sequence reals acquire it via
  [[cor-cauchy-reals-lub-complete]]. This definition is the target for the

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field with its order and
absolute value ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]), and
neighbourhoods are those of [[def-neighbourhood-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Then
$f$ is **continuous at $c$** when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

with $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ ranging over the **positive reals**. In the
language of neighbourhoods: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ with

$$f\bigl(A \cap N_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \;\subseteq\; N_{\varepsilon}\bigl(f(c)\bigr).$$

$f$ is **continuous on $A$** when it is continuous at every point of $A$.

**The point $c$ is required to lie in $A$, and the condition is unpunctured.**
Both differ from [[def-function-limit]], and deliberately. There the quantifier
runs over $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, which removes $x = c$; here $x = c$ is allowed,
and at $x = c$ the implication reads $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$, which is
automatic. So allowing $x = c$ costs nothing, and it is what lets the definition
be stated at every point of $A$, including the points where no limit exists.

**Three clauses, and all three are part of the definition.**

1. **At a limit point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is a limit point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]). Then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if the
   limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) \;=\; f(c)$$
   ([[def-function-limit]]). Indeed, for a given $\varepsilon > 0$ a $\delta$
   witnessing continuity witnesses the limit condition, because the limit
   condition quantifies over a subset of the points continuity quantifies over;
   and conversely a $\delta$ witnessing $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$ witnesses
   continuity, because the one point it omits, $x = c$, satisfies
   $|f(c) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ anyway.

2. **At an isolated point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is an isolated point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so that $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ for some real
   $\eta > 0$. Then **every** $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$: take
   $\delta := \eta$, so that the only $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ is $c$
   itself, and $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$.

3. **On a set.** Continuity on $A$ is continuity at each point of $A$, and
   nothing more. It is not a condition relating $f$ to points outside $A$.

Every point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$,
and never both ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so clauses 1 and 2 between them describe
continuity at every point of $A$.

**This is not the raw $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula of
[[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]].** That item records what goes
wrong when the *punctured* formula of [[def-function-limit]] is written down at
an arbitrary point of the domain: at an isolated point it is satisfied
vacuously by every real $L$ at once, so it defines nothing, and this library
therefore leaves $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ **undefined** at an isolated point.
Continuity at an isolated point is a different matter: the formula above is not
vacuous — it is a genuine condition on $f(c)$, satisfied because $f(c)$ is the
only value being compared with itself — and it names a single, well-defined
property. The limit is undefined there; the continuity is defined, and is
automatic. Clause 1 is the only place where the two notions meet, and it is
stated only where the limit exists as a notion.

**Where the distinction disappears.** If $A$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), then every $c \in A$ has some
$N_{\eta}(c) \subseteq A$, and a punctured neighbourhood is never empty
([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), so every point of $A$ is a limit point of $A$ and
clause 1 covers the whole of $A$. The same holds when $A$ is a nondegenerate
interval ([[def-interval]]). Isolated points are what force clause 2 to exist at
all, and they occur as soon as $A$ is allowed to be an arbitrary subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, as in $A = \{0\} \cup [1,2]$.

## Remarks

- **Continuity is local.** If $\eta > 0$ and $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agrees with
  $f$ on $A \cap N_{\eta}(c)$, then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if $g$
  is: any $\delta$ may be replaced by $\min\{\delta, \eta\}$, after which the
  condition only ever evaluates the two functions where they agree. So
  continuity at $c$ sees only an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of $c$, exactly
  as the limit does ([[lem-limit-is-local]]).

- **Continuity passes to subsets of the domain.** If $B \subseteq A$ and
  $c \in B$, then continuity of $f$ at $c$ gives continuity of the restriction
  $f|_B$ at $c$, with the same $\delta$: the condition on $f|_B$ quantifies over
  fewer points. The converse fails, and the standard witness is the indicator of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ restricted to $\mathbb{Q}$, which is constant and hence
  continuous, while the indicator itself is continuous nowhere
  ([[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]]).

- **The radius is a real number.** As in [[def-neighbourhood-r]], $\varepsilon$
  and $\delta$ range over the positive reals here. Restricting either quantifier
  to the positive rationals defines the same relation, by the passage recorded
  in [[def-function-limit]]: below every positive real lies a positive rational
  ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and a real $\delta$ may be shrunk to a rational
  one below it.

- **The word *continuous* is used for two things in this library, and they
  agree.** [[def-metric-continuity]] defines continuity of a map between metric
  spaces, and $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ carries the metric $d(x,y) = |x-y|$. The
  two notions coincide, and that is proved, not assumed:
  [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]] is the dictionary, and it is stated on
  this page precisely so that no later item has to guess.

## Definition

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]). Write $\mathcal{P}$ for the set of all partitions of
$[a,b]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]) and put

$$\mathcal{L} \;:=\; \{\, L(f,P) \ : \ P \in \mathcal{P} \,\}, \qquad \mathcal{U} \;:=\; \{\, U(f,P) \ : \ P \in \mathcal{P} \,\}$$

for the sets of lower and of upper Darboux sums ([[def-darboux-sums]]).

### Both extrema exist

**$\mathcal{P}$ is nonempty**: the pair $(1, t)$ with $t_0 := a$ and $t_k := b$
for $k \ge 1$ is a partition of $[a,b]$, since $a < b$. So $\mathcal{L}$ and
$\mathcal{U}$ are nonempty.

**$\mathcal{L}$ is bounded above and $\mathcal{U}$ is bounded below.** Fix any
$Q \in \mathcal{P}$. By claim 2 of [[lem-refinement-inequalities]],
$L(f,P) \le U(f,Q)$ for every $P \in \mathcal{P}$, so $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound
of $\mathcal{L}$; and $L(f,Q) \le U(f,P)$ for every $P$, so $L(f,Q)$ is a lower
bound of $\mathcal{U}$.

Hence a nonempty set bounded above has a supremum
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and a nonempty set bounded below has an infimum
([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]), each unique ([[lem-sup-unique]]).
The **lower** and **upper Darboux integrals** of $f$ over $[a,b]$ are the real
numbers

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;:=\; \sup \mathcal{L} \;=\; \sup_{P} L(f,P), \qquad \overline{\int_a^b} f \;:=\; \inf \mathcal{U} \;=\; \inf_{P} U(f,P) .$$

### The lower integral never exceeds the upper one

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f .$$

Indeed, for each fixed $Q \in \mathcal{P}$ the number $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound
of $\mathcal{L}$, so the least upper bound satisfies
$\underline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,Q)$. As $Q$ was arbitrary, $\underline{\int_a^b}f$
is a lower bound of $\mathcal{U}$, and the greatest lower bound satisfies
$\underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f$ ([[def-infimum]]).

Moreover, for **every** partition $P$,

$$L(f,P) \;\le\; \underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; U(f,P) ,$$

the outer inequalities because a member of a set is at most its supremum and at
least its infimum.

### Integrability

$f$ is **Darboux integrable on $[a,b]$**, and on this page simply
**integrable**, when

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;=\; \overline{\int_a^b} f ,$$

and then the common value is written

$$\int_a^b f \qquad \text{or} \qquad \int_a^b f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x ,$$

the **integral of $f$ over $[a,b]$**. It is a single well-determined real
number, being the common value of two numbers each of which is unique
([[lem-sup-unique]]). Without the displayed equality the symbol $\int_a^b f$ is
not defined and is never written.

**The inequality above is the whole difficulty.** By the previous paragraph
integrability is *never* a question of one integral exceeding the other, only of
the gap $\overline{\int_a^b} f - \underline{\int_a^b} f \ge 0$ being $0$; and by
[[thm-riemann-criterion]] that gap is $0$ exactly when a single partition can be
found making $U(f,P) - L(f,P)$ small. Whether that is possible is settled
completely, in terms of the discontinuities of $f$, by
[[thm-lebesgue-criterion]].

**"Riemann integrable" means the same thing here.** The definition above is
Darboux's. Riemann's own definition, in terms of tagged partitions of small
mesh, is [[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]], and the two define the same
class of functions with the same integral by [[thm-darboux-equals-riemann]].
Until that theorem is proved the two phrases are kept apart; after it they are
used interchangeably, as they are throughout the literature.

## Remarks

- **The supremum is over all partitions, and nothing is selected.** Both
  $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{U}$ are sets determined by $f$ and $[a,b]$ alone,
  and $\sup$ and $\inf$ are canonical, so no choice principle is involved in
  forming either integral. Where a choice does enter on this page is recorded in
  [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].

- **Why the lower integral is a supremum and not an infimum.** Refining a
  partition can only increase a lower sum and decrease an upper sum
  ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]]), so the lower sums push up towards the
  integral and the upper sums push down towards it. Taking $\inf \mathcal{L}$
  would return the sum over the coarsest partition and would carry no
  information about $f$ beyond its infimum on $[a,b]$.

- **A bounded $f$ always has both integrals; only their equality can fail.** The
  Dirichlet function on $[0,1]$ has lower integral $0$ and upper integral $1$
  ([[fs-bounded-implies-riemann-integrable]]), which is the standard witness that
  the definition above is not vacuous in either direction.

## Definition

Let $a < b$ be reals, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be **bounded**
([[def-bounded-set]]), so that there is a real $M \ge 0$ with $|f(x)| \le M$ for
every $x \in [a,b]$, and let $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ with
subintervals $I_i = [t_i, t_{i+1}]$ and lengths $\Delta_i = t_{i+1} - t_i$ for
$i < n$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

### The two extreme values on a subinterval

For $i < n$ put

$$m_i \;:=\; \inf f[I_i], \qquad M_i \;:=\; \sup f[I_i], \qquad f[I_i] \;=\; \{\, f(x) : x \in I_i \,\} .$$

**Both exist.** The set $f[I_i]$ is nonempty, because $t_i < t_{i+1}$ makes $I_i$
nonempty ([[def-interval]]), and it is bounded, because $|f(x)| \le M$ for every
$x$ ([[def-bounded-set]]). A nonempty set bounded above has a supremum
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and a nonempty set bounded below has an infimum
([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]); each is unique, so the notations
$\inf f[I_i]$ and $\sup f[I_i]$ name single real numbers ([[lem-sup-unique]]).

**They bracket the values, and each other.** For $x \in I_i$,

$$-M \;\le\; m_i \;\le\; f(x) \;\le\; M_i \;\le\; M ,$$

the outer inequalities because $-M$ is a lower bound and $M$ an upper bound of
$f[I_i]$, and the middle ones by the definitions of infimum and supremum. In
particular $m_i \le M_i$ and $M_i - m_i \le 2M$.

The dependence of $m_i$ and $M_i$ on $f$ and on $P$ is suppressed in the
notation, as is customary; where two partitions are in play the sums below carry
the partition and the extreme values are written out.

### The two Darboux sums

$$L(f,P) \;:=\; \sum_{i<n} m_i \,\Delta_i, \qquad U(f,P) \;:=\; \sum_{i<n} M_i \,\Delta_i ,$$

the finite sums of [[def-finite-sum]], indexed by $i \in \mathbb{N}$ with
$i < n$. Both are real numbers, being finite sums of reals, and

$$L(f,P) \;\le\; U(f,P) ,$$

by monotonicity of finite sums, clause 4 of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], since
$m_i \Delta_i \le M_i \Delta_i$ for every $i < n$: multiplying $m_i \le M_i$ by
$\Delta_i > 0$ preserves the inequality ([[def-ordered-field]]).

### The gap on a subinterval is the oscillation there

For every $i < n$,

$$M_i - m_i \;=\; \omega_f(I_i) \;=\; \sup\{\, |f(x) - f(y)| \ : \ x, y \in I_i \,\} ,$$

the oscillation of $f$ on the set $I_i$ ([[def-oscillation]]). The supremum is a
real number here rather than an extended one, because $f$ is bounded
([[def-oscillation]], [[def-extended-reals]]). The identity is proved in two
inequalities.

*The oscillation is at most the gap.* For $x, y \in I_i$ both $f(x)$ and $f(y)$
lie in $[m_i, M_i]$, so $f(x) - f(y) \le M_i - m_i$ and
$f(y) - f(x) \le M_i - m_i$, whence $|f(x) - f(y)| \le M_i - m_i$
([[lem-of-abs-value]]). So $M_i - m_i$ is an upper bound of the set whose
supremum is $\omega_f(I_i)$.

*The gap is at most the oscillation.* Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real. By the
$\varepsilon$-characterisations of the supremum and the infimum
([[lem-sup-epsilon]], [[lem-inf-epsilon]]) there are $x, y \in I_i$ with
$f(x) > M_i - \varepsilon/2$ and $f(y) < m_i + \varepsilon/2$; then

$$|f(x) - f(y)| \;\ge\; f(x) - f(y) \;>\; (M_i - m_i) - \varepsilon ,$$

so $\omega_f(I_i) > (M_i - m_i) - \varepsilon$. As $\varepsilon > 0$ was
arbitrary, $\omega_f(I_i) \ge M_i - m_i$: otherwise
$\varepsilon := (M_i - m_i) - \omega_f(I_i)$ would be positive and give
$\omega_f(I_i) > \omega_f(I_i)$.

This identity is what connects the Darboux machinery to the pointwise
oscillation of [[def-oscillation]], and it is the hinge of
[[thm-lebesgue-criterion]].

## Remarks

- **Boundedness is a hypothesis of the definition, not of the theorems.** Without
  it $f[I_i]$ may fail to have a supremum in $\mathbb{R}$ and $U(f,P)$ is not
  defined at all. Every statement on this page that mentions $L$ or $U$ therefore
  carries "bounded $f$" in its hypotheses, and none of them is a restriction that
  could be lifted: an unbounded function has no Darboux sums to compare.

- **Why the infimum and the supremum, and not a value of $f$.** Replacing $m_i$
  by $f(\xi_i)$ for a point $\xi_i \in I_i$ gives the Riemann sums of
  [[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]], which depend on a choice of points
  and are not extremal. The Darboux sums are canonical functions of $f$ and $P$
  alone, which is what makes the supremum and infimum over all partitions in
  [[def-darboux-integral]] well posed without any selection.

- **The empty sum does not occur.** A partition has $n \ge 1$
  ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]), so $L(f,P)$ and $U(f,P)$ are sums of at
  least one term. The first term is $m_0 \Delta_0$, over the subinterval
  $[a, t_1]$; the indexing starts at $i = 0$ throughout this page.

## Definition

Throughout this page $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), in particular an ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]]) and a field ([[def-field]]), and $\mathbb{N}$ is the set
of natural numbers ([[def-natural-numbers]]) with successor $\sigma(n) = n + 1$
([[def-nat-addition]]).

Let $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a sequence of reals, written $a_k$ for
$a(k)$. **Finite sums and finite products of $a$ are defined by recursion on the
upper index**, which is legitimate because of the recursion theorem
([[thm-recursion]]). That theorem produces a function of one variable, so the
running index has to be carried along inside the value: applying it to the set
$A = \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$, the starting element $(0, 0)$ and the function
$f(n, s) = (\sigma(n),\, s + a_n)$ gives a unique
$g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$ with

$$g(0) = (0, 0), \qquad g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n)) \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Write $g(n) = \big(\pi_1(g(n)),\, \Sigma_n\big)$ for its two coordinates.

**The first coordinate is the index itself, and that is a small induction, not an
observation** ([[thm-induction-principle]]). Indeed $\pi_1(g(0)) = 0$; and if
$\pi_1(g(n)) = n$, then
$g(\sigma(n)) = f\big(\pi_1(g(n)), \Sigma_n\big) = \big(\sigma(\pi_1(g(n))),\, \Sigma_n + a_{\pi_1(g(n))}\big) = \big(\sigma(n),\, \Sigma_n + a_n\big)$,
so $\pi_1(g(\sigma(n))) = \sigma(n)$. By induction $\pi_1(g(n)) = n$ for every
$n \in \mathbb{N}$. Only now may the second coordinate of the two displayed
clauses be read off, and doing so gives

$$\Sigma_0 = 0, \qquad \Sigma_{\sigma(n)} = \Sigma_n + a_n .$$

$\Sigma$ is moreover the **unique** function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with those
two properties: if $\Sigma'$ also has them then $n \mapsto (n, \Sigma'_n)$ satisfies
the two clauses defining $g$, hence equals $g$ by the uniqueness clause of
[[thm-recursion]], so $\Sigma' = \Sigma$.

We write $\sum_{k < n} a_k := \Sigma_n$. The same construction with starting
element $(0, 1)$ and $f(n, p) = (\sigma(n),\, p \cdot a_n)$, with the same
induction on the first coordinate and the same uniqueness argument, gives the
unique $\Pi : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with

$$\Pi_0 = 1, \qquad \Pi_{\sigma(n)} = \Pi_n \cdot a_n ,$$

and we write $\prod_{k < n} a_k := \Pi_n$.

**Notation.** For $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ we abbreviate

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \sum_{k < n+1} a_k, \qquad \prod_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \prod_{k < n+1} a_k,$$

and, for a general lower index $m$ with $m \le n + 1$, writing $d = n + 1 - m$
for the number of terms,

$$\sum_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \sum_{j < d} a_{m+j}, \qquad \prod_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \prod_{j < d} a_{m+j} .$$

When $m = n + 1$ we have $d = 0$ and the sum is **empty**, with value $0$, while
the empty product has value $1$. In the same spirit $\sum_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ is
notation for the empty sum $\Sigma_0 = 0$ and $\prod_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ for the
empty product $\Pi_0 = 1$; the index $-1$ never occurs as an element of
$\mathbb{N}$ and is only a way of writing "no terms".

Only finitely many values of $a$ enter $\sum_{k<n} a_k$, so the notation
$\sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\prod_{k<n} a_k$ is also used for a list
$a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$ of reals given without reference to any extension of the
list to all of $\mathbb{N}$: extend the list by $a_k = 0$ (respectively
$a_k = 1$) for $k \ge n$ and apply the definition above.

## Remarks

- **Why recursion and not "$a_0 + a_1 + \cdots + a_{n-1}$".** The dots are not a
  definition: they presuppose that the displayed pattern determines a value for
  every $n$, which is exactly what the recursion theorem
  ([[thm-recursion]]) supplies, and its uniqueness clause is what makes
  $\sum_{k<n} a_k$ a single well-determined real rather than a family of choices.
  Associativity and commutativity of addition are *not* used in the definition;
  they are used in the laws proved from it ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).
- **Naturals and rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$ (a convention used on the whole
  page).** A natural number $n$ and a rational number $r$ are not literally
  elements of $\mathbb{R}$: they enter $\mathbb{R}$ through the canonical
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$, which is an injective,
  order-preserving field homomorphism ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), restricting on
  positive naturals to $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} = 1_\mathbb{R} + \cdots + 1_\mathbb{R}$
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). Following ordinary practice, and only where no
  confusion is possible, we write $n$ for $\iota(n)$ and $r$ for $\iota(r)$; so,
  for instance, $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k<n} a_k$ means
  $\iota(n)^{-1} \cdot \sum_{k<n} a_k$, which makes sense because
  $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$. Exponents are the one place where the
  identification is deliberately NOT made: in $a^n$ and $a^r$ the exponent stays
  a natural, an integer or a rational ([[def-integer-power]],
  [[def-rational-power]]), never a real.
- The two indexings are related by $\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k = \sum_{k < n+1} a_k$, so
  a statement proved for one is available for the other. Sums over $k < n$ are
  the primitive form here because $\Sigma_0$, the empty sum, is then the base
  case of every induction, and no index outside $\mathbb{N}$ is ever needed.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

Let $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with open sets as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

- An **open cover** of $K$ is a family $\mathcal{U}$ of open subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$ with $K \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{U}$.
- A **subcover** of $\mathcal{U}$ is a subfamily $\mathcal{V} \subseteq
  \mathcal{U}$ that is still an open cover of $K$.
- A subfamily $\mathcal{V} \subseteq \mathcal{U}$ is **finite** when
  $\mathcal{V} = \varnothing$ or there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and members
  $U_0, \dots, U_n$ of $\mathcal{U}$ with $\mathcal{V} = \{U_0, \dots, U_n\}$;
  repetitions in the list are allowed and harmless.
- $K$ is **compact** when every open cover of $K$ has a finite subcover:
  for every open cover $\mathcal{U}$ of $K$, either $K = \varnothing$ and the
  empty subfamily covers it, or there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
  $U_0, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{U}$ with
  $$K \subseteq U_0 \cup \dots \cup U_n .$$
- $K$ is **sequentially compact** when every sequence $(x_k)$ of reals with
  $x_k \in K$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-sequence]]) has a subsequence
  converging ([[def-real-limit]]) to some point of $K$; equivalently, when every
  such sequence has a subsequential limit ([[def-subsequential-limit]]) that
  lies in $K$.

**Compactness is a property of $K$ alone.** The covering families range over open
subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, not over sets open in some other ambient space, so the
notion defined here is compactness of $K$ as a subset of $\mathbb{R}$. Nothing
below relativises it to a smaller ambient field; where an ordered field other
than $\mathbb{R}$ is meant, as in
[[fs-closed-bounded-compact-without-completeness]], the whole vocabulary is set
up again there for that field.

**$\varnothing$ is compact and sequentially compact.** The empty subfamily covers
it, and there is no sequence with all terms in $\varnothing$, so both conditions
hold vacuously.

## Remarks

- **Why "finite" is spelled out by listing.** A finite subfamily is described
  here as one that can be written $\{U_0, \dots, U_n\}$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}$,
  which is exactly the form every proof on this page produces or consumes: the
  bisection argument of [[thm-heine-borel-r]] produces a one-member list, and
  the arguments of [[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]] consume a list by
  taking a maximum over it ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]). Since $\mathbb{N}$
  contains $0$, the shortest nonempty list is $\{U_0\}$.

- **The two notions are not defined to be equivalent, and their equivalence is a
  theorem.** For subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ it is
  [[thm-compact-iff-sequentially-compact-r]]; both of its implications run
  through the characterisation of compactness by closed and bounded, and its
  forward implication additionally uses Bolzano-Weierstrass. Neither implication
  is formal.

- **Compactness is not inherited by subsets, but by closed subsets.** A closed
  subset of a compact set is compact, which is immediate from
  [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]] once that is available, whereas
  $(0,1) \subseteq [0,1]$ shows that an arbitrary subset of a compact set need
  not be compact.

- **The empty cover.** If $K \ne \varnothing$ then no open cover of $K$ is
  empty, so the case distinction in the definition of compactness only ever
  matters for $K = \varnothing$; it is written out so that the definition does
  not quietly assume $K$ nonempty.

## Definition

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ ([[def-field]]) together with a subset
$P \subseteq F$, the set of **positive** elements (the *positive cone*),
satisfying:

- **(O1) Trichotomy.** For each $x \in F$, exactly one of the following holds:
  $x \in P$, or $x = 0$, or $-x \in P$.
- **(O2) Closure.** If $x, y \in P$ then $x + y \in P$ and $x \cdot y \in P$.

We write $x > 0$ for $x \in P$ (read "$x$ is positive"), and define the order by

$$a < b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; b - a \in P, \qquad a \le b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; a < b \text{ or } a = b.$$

Thus $a > b$ means $b < a$, and $a \ge b$ means $b \le a$. An element $x$ with
$-x \in P$ (equivalently $x < 0$) is called **negative**.

## Remarks

- By trichotomy applied to $b - a$, for any $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$,
  $a = b$, $a > b$ holds; this makes $\le$ a total order.
- (O2) says the positives are closed under addition and multiplication: sums and
  products of positives are positive.
- The rationals ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and both constructions of the reals
  ([[thm-reals-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-dedekind-ordered-field]]) are ordered
  fields, so every fact proved here from (O1)-(O2) holds in each of them.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$. All suprema and
infima below are taken in the extended real line
$\overline{\mathbb{R}} = \mathbb{R} \cup \{-\infty, +\infty\}$
([[def-extended-reals]]), where **every** subset has a least upper bound and a
greatest lower bound ([[lem-extended-reals-complete]]); no boundedness
hypothesis on $f$ is therefore needed anywhere, and none is imposed.

**Oscillation on a set.** For $S \subseteq A$ put

$$\omega_f(S) \;:=\; \sup\{\, |f(x) - f(y)| \;:\; x, y \in S \,\} \;\in\; \overline{\mathbb{R}} .$$

**Oscillation at a point.** For $c \in A$ put

$$\omega_f(c) \;:=\; \inf\{\, \omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c)) \;:\; \delta \in \mathbb{R},\ \delta > 0 \,\} \;\in\; \overline{\mathbb{R}},$$

where $N_\delta(c) = (c - \delta, c + \delta)$ is the $\delta$-neighbourhood of
$c$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

The two uses of the symbol $\omega_f$ are distinguished by their argument: a
subset of $A$ in the first, a point of $A$ in the second. Where confusion is
possible the first is written $\omega_f(S)$ with $S$ named as a set.

### Both values are well posed; point oscillation and nonempty-set oscillation are nonnegative

**The set in the first display is nonempty whenever $S$ is**, since $x = y \in S$
gives the value $|f(x) - f(x)| = 0$; so $\omega_f(S) \ge 0$ for nonempty $S$,
and $\omega_f(S) = \sup \varnothing = -\infty$ for $S = \varnothing$
([[lem-extended-reals-complete]]). Only nonempty $S$ occurs below.

**The set in the second display is nonempty**, since some real $\delta > 0$
exists, and each of its members is $\ge 0$: for $c \in A$ the set
$A \cap N_\delta(c)$ contains $c$ itself, because $|c - c| = 0 < \delta$, so it
is nonempty and $\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c)) \ge 0$
([[lem-of-abs-value]]). Hence $0$ is a lower bound of that set and

$$0 \;\le\; \omega_f(c) \;\le\; \omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c)) \qquad \text{for every real } \delta > 0,$$

the second inequality because $\omega_f(c)$ is a lower bound of the set of which
$\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c))$ is a member. In particular $\omega_f(c)$ is never
$-\infty$.

### Monotonicity, and the case of a bounded $f$

**$\omega_f$ is monotone under inclusion.** If $S \subseteq T \subseteq A$ then
every value $|f(x) - f(y)|$ with $x, y \in S$ is also a value with $x, y \in T$,
so the first set of values is contained in the second and
$\omega_f(S) \le \omega_f(T)$: a supremum of a subset is at most the supremum of
the set. Consequently $\delta \mapsto \omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c))$ is
nondecreasing in $\delta$, since $\delta \le \delta'$ gives
$N_\delta(c) \subseteq N_{\delta'}(c)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

**When $f$ is bounded, nonempty-set and point oscillations are real.** Suppose
there is a real $M$ with $|f(x)| \le M$ for every $x \in A$
([[def-bounded-set]]). Then for $x, y \in A$,

$$|f(x) - f(y)| \;\le\; |f(x)| + |f(y)| \;\le\; 2M$$

([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]), so $\omega_f(S) \le 2M$
for every $S \subseteq A$. If
$S$ is nonempty, $\omega_f(S)$ is a real number in $[0,2M]$, and every point
oscillation is also a real number in $[0,2M]$: the supremum of a nonempty
subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$ is the real
supremum ([[lem-extended-reals-complete]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]],
[[def-infimum]]). The convention $\omega_f(\varnothing)=-\infty$ remains the
single empty-set exception. Apart from that exception, an infinite extended
value can occur only when $f$ is unbounded.

**The notation.** The letter is $\omega$ throughout this library, never
"$\operatorname{osc}$", and the function is always in the subscript.

## Definition

**Standing hypothesis for this page.** Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete
ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]),
$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers and **contains $0$**
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[def-nat-order]]), $\iota : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$
is the canonical natural ([[def-canonical-natural]]), and $a, b$ are reals with

$$a \;<\; b .$$

Intervals and their lengths are those of [[def-interval]]; finite sums are those
of [[def-finite-sum]], indexed as $\sum_{i<n}$ over $i \in \mathbb{N}$.

### Partitions

A **partition of $[a,b]$** is a pair $P = (n, t)$ consisting of a natural number
$n \ge 1$ and a sequence $t : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-sequence]]) with

$$t_0 = a, \qquad t_i < t_{i+1} \ \text{ for every } i < n, \qquad t_k = b \ \text{ for every } k \ge n .$$

The tail convention on the third clause is bookkeeping only: it makes $t$ a
genuine sequence, so that the finite-sum laws of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] apply to
it verbatim, and it costs nothing because no index above $n$ is ever read. The
first two clauses say exactly that

$$a \;=\; t_0 \;<\; t_1 \;<\; \dots \;<\; t_n \;=\; b ,$$

the last equality because $t_n = b$ by the third clause. In particular
$i \mapsto t_i$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on
$\{\, i \in \mathbb{N} : i \le n \,\}$ ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]),
and $a \le t_i \le b$ for every $i \le n$.

The **point set** of $P$ is the finite set

$$\operatorname{pts}(P) \;:=\; \{\, t_i \ : \ i \le n \,\} \;\subseteq\; [a,b], \qquad a, b \in \operatorname{pts}(P) .$$

The **subintervals** of $P$ are

$$I_i \;:=\; [\,t_i,\ t_{i+1}\,] \qquad (i < n),$$

and their **lengths** are $\Delta_i := t_{i+1} - t_i$. Each $\Delta_i > 0$, so
each $I_i$ is a nondegenerate closed bounded interval ([[def-interval]]). There
are $n$ of them and they are indexed from $i = 0$, not from $i = 1$: the first
subinterval is $[t_0, t_1] = [a, t_1]$.

**The lengths sum to $b - a$.** By the telescoping law, clause 5 of
[[lem-finite-sum-laws]],

$$\sum_{i<n} \Delta_i \;=\; \sum_{i<n} (t_{i+1} - t_i) \;=\; t_n - t_0 \;=\; b - a .$$

**The mesh.** The set $\{\, \Delta_i : i < n \,\}$ is a nonempty finite set of
reals, nonempty because $n \ge 1$, so it has a maximum
([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]). The **mesh** of $P$ is

$$\|P\| \;:=\; \max\{\, \Delta_i \ : \ i < n \,\} \;>\; 0 ,$$

and $\Delta_i \le \|P\|$ for every $i < n$.

**The uniform partition.** For a natural $N \ge 1$, the **uniform partition of
$[a,b]$ into $N$ parts** is $U_N := (N, t)$ with

$$t_i \;:=\; a + \iota(i)\,\frac{b-a}{\iota(N)} \quad (i \le N), \qquad t_k := b \quad (k \ge N).$$

This is a partition: $t_0 = a$; $t_N = a + (b-a) = b$; and $t_{i+1} - t_i =
(b-a)/\iota(N) > 0$ for $i < N$, because $\iota(N) > 0$ and $\iota(i+1) =
\iota(i) + 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[def-canonical-natural]]). Its
subinterval lengths are all equal to $(b-a)/\iota(N)$, so

### A partition is determined by its point set

**Claim.** If $P = (n,t)$ and $P' = (n', t')$ are partitions of $[a,b]$ with
$\operatorname{pts}(P) = \operatorname{pts}(P')$, then $n = n'$ and $t_i = t'_i$
for every $i \le n$.

*Proof.* First, $t_i = t'_i$ for every $i \le \min\{n,n'\}$, by induction on $i$
([[thm-induction-principle]]). For $i = 0$ both equal $a$. Suppose $t_j = t'_j$
for all $j \le i$ and $i + 1 \le \min\{n,n'\}$. The set
$S := \{\, x \in \operatorname{pts}(P) : x > t_i \,\}$ has $t_{i+1}$ as its least
element: $t_{i+1} \in S$, and any $x \in S$ is $t_j$ for some $j \le n$ with
$t_j > t_i$, which forces $j > i$ because $t$ is increasing on indices $\le n$,
hence $j \ge i+1$ and $x = t_j \ge t_{i+1}$. The same argument in $P'$ makes
$t'_{i+1}$ the least element of
$\{\, x \in \operatorname{pts}(P') : x > t'_i \,\}$, which is the same set $S$,
since the point sets agree and $t'_i = t_i$. A set has at most one least element
([[def-max-min]]), so $t_{i+1} = t'_{i+1}$.

Second, $n = n'$. If $n < n'$ then $t'_n = t_n = b$ by the previous paragraph,
while $t'_n < t'_{n'} = b$ because $t'$ is increasing on indices $\le n'$ and
$n < n'$; that is impossible. Exchanging the roles of $P$ and $P'$ rules out
$n' < n$. $\square$

So the map $P \mapsto \operatorname{pts}(P)$ is injective, and a partition may be
named by its point set whenever one is exhibited.

### Inserting a point

Let $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ and let $c \in [a,b]$. Define a
partition $P + c$ of $[a,b]$ as follows.

- If $c \in \operatorname{pts}(P)$, put $P + c := P$.
- Otherwise $c \ne a$ and $c \ne b$, so $a < c < b$. The set
  $T := \{\, t_i : i \le n \text{ and } t_i < c \,\}$ is a nonempty finite set of
  reals, nonempty because $t_0 = a < c$, so it has a maximum
  ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]); let $i_0 \le n$ be the unique index with
  $t_{i_0} = \max T$, unique because $t$ is injective on indices $\le n$. Then
  $i_0 < n$, since $t_n = b > c$ puts $t_n \notin T$; and
  $$t_{i_0} \;<\; c \;<\; t_{i_0+1},$$
  the right inequality because $t_{i_0+1} \ne c$ (as $c \notin \operatorname{pts}(P)$)
  and $t_{i_0+1} < c$ would put $t_{i_0+1} \in T$ with $t_{i_0+1} > t_{i_0} = \max T$.
  Put $P + c := (n+1, s)$ with
  $$s_i := t_i \ (i \le i_0), \qquad s_{i_0+1} := c, \qquad s_i := t_{i-1} \ (i_0 + 2 \le i \le n+1), \qquad s_k := b \ (k \ge n+1).$$

In both cases $P + c$ is a partition of $[a,b]$ and

$$\operatorname{pts}(P + c) \;=\; \operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \{c\}, \qquad \|P+c\| \;\le\; \|P\| .$$

The displayed identity is immediate from the two cases. For the mesh: in the
first case nothing changes; in the second the list of subinterval lengths of
$P + c$ is that of $P$ with $\Delta_{i_0}$ replaced by the two numbers
$c - t_{i_0}$ and $t_{i_0+1} - c$, each of which is smaller than
$\Delta_{i_0} = (c - t_{i_0}) + (t_{i_0+1} - c)$ because the other is positive.
So every length of $P + c$ is at most a length of $P$, and the maximum cannot
increase. Finally the index count grows by exactly $1$ in the second case and
not at all in the first.

### Refinement and the common refinement

$P'$ **refines** $P$, and is a **refinement** of $P$, when

$$\operatorname{pts}(P) \;\subseteq\; \operatorname{pts}(P') .$$

Let $P = (n,t)$ and $Q = (m,s)$ be partitions of $[a,b]$. Applying the recursion
theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) to the set $\mathbb{N} \times \mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$,
where $\mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$ is the set of partitions of $[a,b]$, with starting
element $(0, P)$ and the map $(j, R) \mapsto (j+1,\ R + s_j)$ — legitimate
because $s_j \in [a,b]$ for every $j \in \mathbb{N}$ — gives a unique family
$(R_j)_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ of partitions with $R_0 = P$ and $R_{j+1} = R_j + s_j$.
The **common refinement** of $P$ and $Q$ is

$$P \vee Q \;:=\; R_{m+1} .$$

**Its point set is the union.** By induction on $j$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]),
$\operatorname{pts}(R_j) = \operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \{\, s_l : l < j \,\}$;
taking $j = m+1$ gives

$$\operatorname{pts}(P \vee Q) \;=\; \operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \operatorname{pts}(Q).$$

Hence $P \vee Q$ refines both $P$ and $Q$; by the uniqueness claim above it is
the **only** partition with that point set, so $P \vee Q = Q \vee P$, and

$$P' \text{ refines } P \quad \Longrightarrow \quad P \vee P' = P' ,$$

since then $\operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \operatorname{pts}(P') =
\operatorname{pts}(P')$.

**Two size bounds, both used later.** Writing $n_R$ for the first component of a
partition $R$:

$$\|P \vee Q\| \;\le\; \|P\|, \qquad n_{P \vee Q} \;\le\; n_P + n_Q - 1 .$$

The first is the mesh bound above applied $m+1$ times. For the second, each
insertion raises the index count by at most $1$, and the two insertions of
$s_0 = a$ and $s_m = b$ raise it by $0$, since $a$ and $b$ already lie in
$\operatorname{pts}(P)$ and hence in $\operatorname{pts}(R_j)$ for every $j$; so
at most $m - 1$ of the $m+1$ insertions increase it.

### The index map of a refinement

Let $P' = (n',t')$ refine $P = (n,t)$. For each $i \le n$ the point $t_i$ lies in
$\operatorname{pts}(P')$, so there is exactly one $\varphi(i) \le n'$ with
$t'_{\varphi(i)} = t_i$, uniqueness because $t'$ is injective on indices $\le n'$.
The resulting map $\varphi$ satisfies

$$\varphi(0) = 0, \qquad \varphi(n) = n', \qquad \varphi(i) < \varphi(i+1) \ \ (i < n),$$

the first two because $t'_0 = a = t_0$ and $t'_{n'} = b = t_n$ together with
injectivity, and the third because $t_i < t_{i+1}$ and $t'$ is increasing on
indices $\le n'$. In particular $n \le n'$. Moreover, for $i < n$ and
$\varphi(i) \le j < \varphi(i+1)$,

$$I'_j \;=\; [\,t'_j,\ t'_{j+1}\,] \;\subseteq\; [\,t_i,\ t_{i+1}\,] \;=\; I_i ,$$

because $t_i = t'_{\varphi(i)} \le t'_j$ and $t'_{j+1} \le t'_{\varphi(i+1)} = t_{i+1}$.

**The blocks are counted by telescoping.** By clause 5 of
[[lem-finite-sum-laws]],
$\sum_{i<n}\big(\varphi(i+1) - \varphi(i)\big) = \varphi(n) - \varphi(0) = n'$,
so, subtracting $\sum_{i<n} 1 = n$,

$$\sum_{i<n} \big(\varphi(i+1) - \varphi(i) - 1\big) \;=\; n' - n ,$$

a sum of $n$ nonnegative integers, one for each block, which vanishes exactly at
the blocks consisting of a single index. This identity is the whole content of
the quantitative bound in [[lem-refinement-inequalities]], and it is also why
$n \le n'$.

Finally, the lengths inside a block sum to the length of the block:

$$\sum_{j = \varphi(i)}^{\varphi(i+1)-1} \Delta'_j \;=\; t'_{\varphi(i+1)} - t'_{\varphi(i)} \;=\; t_{i+1} - t_i \;=\; \Delta_i \qquad (i < n),$$

again by telescoping, applied to the sequence $l \mapsto t'_{\varphi(i)+l}$ and
read through the index-shift convention of [[def-finite-sum]].

## Remarks

- **Why $a < b$ is a standing hypothesis and not a case.** With $a = b$ the
  displayed chain $a = t_0 < \dots < t_n = b$ is unsatisfiable for $n \ge 1$, and
  admitting $n = 0$ would give a partition with no subintervals, an empty mesh
  set and no maximum. Every statement on this page is about a nondegenerate
  closed bounded interval, and the convention $\int_a^a f := 0$ is not adopted
  here because nothing below needs it.

- **The subintervals overlap at their shared endpoints, and that is harmless.**
  $I_i \cap I_{i+1} = \{t_{i+1}\}$, so the union $\bigcup_{i<n} I_i = [a,b]$ is
  not disjoint. Every quantity attached to a partition below is a sum over $i<n$
  of a number times $\Delta_i$, and a single point contributes length $0$, so no
  statement on this page is sensitive to the double counting of the $n-1$
  interior points.

- **Refinement is a relation between point sets, not between lists.** Defining it
  as "$P'$ is obtained from $P$ by inserting points" would be the same relation,
  by the uniqueness claim above, but it would make every proof carry an
  insertion order. The index map $\varphi$ recovers the list-level picture when
  it is wanted, and it is what [[lem-refinement-inequalities]] actually uses.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$. Then $f$ is
**uniformly continuous on $A$** when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x, x' \in A)\ \bigl[\ |x - x'| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - f(x')| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

with $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ ranging over the positive reals.

**The whole content is in the order of the quantifiers.** Written out,
continuity on $A$ ([[def-continuity-real]]) is

$$\forall \varepsilon\ \forall c \in A\ \exists \delta\ \forall x \in A ,$$

and uniform continuity is

$$\forall \varepsilon\ \exists \delta\ \forall x' \in A\ \forall x \in A .$$

Moving $\exists \delta$ to the left of the point quantifier is the entire
difference: for continuity the radius may shrink from point to point, for
uniform continuity one radius must serve the whole of $A$ at once. This is the
same distinction, for the same reason, that [[def-metric-uniform-continuity]]
draws for maps of metric spaces.

**Uniform continuity implies continuity.** Given $\varepsilon > 0$, take the
$\delta$ supplied by uniform continuity and, at a point $c \in A$, apply the
condition with $x' := c$: every $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ satisfies
$|f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$. So the same $\delta$ witnesses continuity at
every point of $A$ simultaneously. The converse fails, and the failure is not
marginal: [[fs-continuity-implies-uniform-continuity]] refutes it on this page,
and the companion page works two witnesses out in full.

**Uniform continuity is a property of the pair $(f, A)$, not of $f$ alone.** The
same formula may be uniformly continuous on one set and not on another:
$x \mapsto 1/x$ is uniformly continuous on $[1,\infty)$ and not on $(0,1)$, and
$x \mapsto x^{2}$ is uniformly continuous on every bounded interval and not on
$\mathbb{R}$. Restricting the domain therefore never destroys uniform
continuity, since the condition then quantifies over fewer pairs; enlarging it
may.

**The two points are unordered and may coincide.** Nothing above excludes
$x = x'$, at which the implication reads $|f(x) - f(x)| = 0 < \varepsilon$
([[lem-of-abs-value]]) and is automatic, and the condition is symmetric in the
two points because $|x - x'| = |x' - x|$.

## Remarks

- **A single $\delta$, and a picture.** For a uniformly continuous $f$ one may
  slide a rectangle of width $\delta$ and height $2\varepsilon$ along the graph
  and never have the graph leave it through the top or bottom. For a merely
  continuous $f$ the rectangle must be narrowed as one moves, and on
  $x \mapsto 1/x$ over $(0,1)$ it must be narrowed without limit.

- **Neighbourhood form.** The condition says
  $f\bigl(A \cap N_{\delta}(x')\bigr) \subseteq N_{\varepsilon}(f(x'))$ for
  every $x' \in A$, with one $\delta$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). That is
  continuity on $A$ with the radius independent of the centre.

- **On an interval this is the notion the extension theorem needs.** A
  uniformly continuous function on a set $D$ extends to one on the closure of
  $D$ ([[cor-continuous-extension-from-a-dense-subset-r]]); mere continuity does
  not suffice, since $x \mapsto 1/x$ on $(0,1)$ has no continuous extension to
  $[0,1]$ ([[def-interval]]).

- **The two standard witnesses, for orientation.** The converse fails in two
  independent ways, each worked out on the companion page:
  [[cex-one-over-x-is-not-uniformly-continuous-on-the-unit-interval]] on a
  bounded domain that is not closed, and
  [[cex-x-squared-is-not-uniformly-continuous-on-r]] on a closed domain that is
  not bounded. Both are named here for orientation only; nothing in this
  definition rests on them.

- **Lipschitz and Hölder conditions are stronger still, and are not redefined
  here.** They are [[def-lipschitz-holder-contraction]] instantiated at
  $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ with $d(x,y) = |x-y|$; the dictionary that makes that
  instantiation legitimate, and that transports the implications of
  [[thm-metric-regularity-hierarchy]] to real functions, is
  [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]], immediately below.

## Statement

Let $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be sequences of reals, let
$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, and let $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, with finite sums and
finite products as in [[def-finite-sum]]. Then:

1. **Additivity.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k$.
2. **Scaling.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k$; in particular $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda = n\lambda$, where $n$ denotes the canonical natural $\iota(n) \in \mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).
3. **Splitting.** If $m \le n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k$, and $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n} a_k = \Big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k\Big)$.
4. **Monotonicity.** If $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$. In particular, if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, every single term satisfies $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$ for $j < n$, and $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ forces $a_k = 0$ for every $k < n$.
5. **Telescoping.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}\big(c_{k+1} - c_k\big) = c_n - c_0$.
6. **Products.** $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k) = \Big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\Big)$; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, and if $a_k > 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k > 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\lambda$, and naturals $m, n$. Write $\Sigma_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\Pi_n = \prod_{k<n} a_k$.

[L1] Recursion clauses ([[def-finite-sum]]): $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ and $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n$; $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1$ and $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) \cdot a_n$; and $\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k = \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j}$ for $m \le n$, likewise for products.

[L2] Field axioms: addition and multiplication are associative and commutative, $0$ and $1$ are the identities, $x - x = 0$, and multiplication distributes over addition ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]); and $0 \cdot x = 0$, which is not an axiom but a lemma ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

[L3] Induction principle: a property holding at $0$ and inherited by successors holds at every natural ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L4] Adding inequalities: $x \le y$ and $u \le v$ imply $x + u \le y + v$. [[lem-of-add-order]] states the STRICT forms and only those ($x < y \Rightarrow x + c < y + c$, and $x < y$ with $u < v$ giving $x + u < y + v$); the nonstrict form used throughout below is those two together with the cases $x = y$ and $u = v$, which are settled by trichotomy, the order being total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] The canonical embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a field homomorphism, so $\iota(0) = 0$ and $\iota(n+1) = \iota(n) + 1$, and $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L6] Sign rules: a product of two positives is positive ([[lem-of-sign-rules]], claim 1), and a product of two nonnegatives is nonnegative, since a factor equal to $0$ makes the product $0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]) and otherwise both factors are positive; and $1 > 0$, which is proved in [[cor-of-one-positive]] and stated by none of the items named above.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 0$: every claim holds at $n = 0$, since both sides of claim 1 are $0 = 0 + 0$, both sides of claim 2 are $0 = \lambda \cdot 0$ and $0 = \iota(0)\lambda$, claim 4 reads $0 \le 0$ with no term to bound and the hypothesis $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ giving nothing to prove, claim 5 reads $0 = c_0 - c_0$, and claim 6 reads $1 = 1 \cdot 1$ with $1 > 0$. [base, L1, L2, L5, L6]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for this $n$ and for all sequences $a, b, c$ and all $\lambda$. [ih]

1.3 Splitting, claim 3, by a separate induction on the number of trailing terms $d = n - m$ with $m$ fixed: for $d = 0$ the claim reads $\sum_{k<m} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + 0$ and $\prod_{k<m} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\big) \cdot 1$, which hold; and if $\sum_{k<m+d} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d} a_{m+j}$, then $\sum_{k<m+d+1} a_k = \sum_{k<m+d} a_k + a_{m+d} = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \big(\sum_{j<d} a_{m+j} + a_{m+d}\big) = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d+1} a_{m+j}$ by associativity, and identically for products with $1$ in place of $0$ and multiplication in place of addition, so induction on $d$ gives claim 3 for every $m \le n$. [L1, L2, L3]

2.1 Additivity at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k\big) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) + \big(\sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n\big) = \sum_{k<n+1} a_k + \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$, using the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of addition. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Scaling at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda a_k = \sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda\big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) = \lambda \sum_{k<n+1} a_k$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and distributivity; taking $a_k = 1$ for all $k$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda = \sum_{k<n} \lambda + \lambda = \iota(n)\lambda + \lambda = (\iota(n) + 1)\lambda = \iota(n+1)\lambda$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L5]

2.3 Monotonicity at $n+1$: assume $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n+1$; then $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$, so the hypothesis gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$, and adding the inequality $a_n \le b_n$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n \le \sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n = \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$. [step 1.2, L1, L4]

2.4 Telescoping at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(c_{k+1} - c_k) = \sum_{k<n}(c_{k+1} - c_k) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = (c_n - c_0) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = c_{n+1} - c_0$, by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and the field identities. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.5 Products at $n+1$: $\prod_{k<n+1}(a_k b_k) = \big(\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k)\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n+1} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n+1} b_k\big)$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of multiplication; and if every $a_k \ge 0$ for $k < n+1$ then $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) a_n$ is a product of two nonnegatives, hence nonnegative, with the same argument giving positivity from positivity since $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1 > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L6]

3.1 Consequences of monotonicity, completing claim 4: monotonicity itself holds at every $n$, by the induction principle applied to the base case of step 1.1 and the successor step 2.3, so it is available for an arbitrary $n$ in what follows; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then comparing with the zero sequence gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge \sum_{k<n} 0 = 0$; for $j < n$ splitting at $j$ and then at $j+1$ writes $\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<j} a_k + a_j + \sum_{k=j+1}^{n-1} a_k$ with the first and third summands $\ge 0$, so $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$; and if moreover $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ then $0 \le a_j \le 0$ for every $j < n$, so $a_j = 0$. [step 1.1, step 2.3, step 1.3, L3, L4, L2]

4.1 By the induction principle claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and claim 3 was proved in step 1.3 with its consequences in step 3.1, so all six laws hold. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, step 2.5, step 1.3, step 3.1, L3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$, with
$|x|$ the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]). Then

$$|x| \ge 0; \quad |x| = 0 \iff x = 0; \quad -|x| \le x \le |x|; \quad |-x| = |x|; \quad |xy| = |x|\,|y|;$$

and, for every $c > 0$, one has $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and elements $x, y \in F$.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| = u$ if $u \ge 0$, and $|u| = -u$ if $u < 0$ ([[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Ordered-field order: trichotomy holds (for each $u$ exactly one of $u > 0$, $u = 0$, $u < 0$), $a < b$ means $b - a$ is positive, and sums and products of positives are positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Signs in products: $(-a)b = -(ab)$ and $(-a)(-b) = ab$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] Sign rules: a product of two elements of the same sign is positive, and a product of two elements of opposite sign is negative ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Case $x > 0$: by [L1] $|x| = x > 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; since $-x < 0$ we get $|-x| = -(-x) = x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -x < 0 < x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case pos, L1, L2, algebra]

1.2 Case $x = 0$: then $|x| = |0| = 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ holds with $|x| = 0$ and $x = 0$, while $|-x| = |0| = |x|$ and $-|x| = 0 \le 0 \le 0 = |x|$. [assume-case zero, L1]

1.3 Case $x < 0$: by [L1] $|x| = -x$, and [L2] gives $-x > 0$, so $|x| > 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; here $|-x| = -x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -(-x) = x \le x$ while $x < 0 < -x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case neg, L1, L2, algebra]

1.4 Case $x = 0$ or $y = 0$: then $xy = 0$, so $|xy| = 0$, and one of $|x|, |y|$ is $0$, whence $|x|\,|y| = 0 = |xy|$. [assume-case zerofactor, L1]

1.5 Case $x, y$ have the same sign (both positive or both negative): by [L4] $xy > 0$, so $|xy| = xy$, while $|x|\,|y| = xy$ by [L3] (for $x, y < 0$ this is $(-x)(-y) = xy$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case same, L1, L3, L4]

1.6 Case $x, y$ have opposite signs (one positive, one negative): by [L4] $xy < 0$, so $|xy| = -(xy)$, while $|x|\,|y| = -(xy)$ by [L3] (namely $x(-y)$ or $(-x)y$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case opposite, L1, L3, L4]

2.1 By trichotomy [L2] each $x$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.1-1.3, and in each we verified $|x| \ge 0$, that $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$, that $|-x| = |x|$, and that $-|x| \le x \le |x|$; hence all four hold for every $x$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, cases-exhaustive]

2.2 By trichotomy [L2] each pair $x, y$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.4-1.6, and in each $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$ for all $x, y$. [step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6, cases-exhaustive]

3.1 Let $c > 0$: if $|x| < c$ then $-c < -|x| \le x \le |x| < c$ by [step 2.1] and [L2], so $-c < x < c$; conversely if $-c < x < c$ then both $x < c$ and $-x < c$, and since $|x|$ equals $x$ or $-x$ by [L1], we get $|x| < c$, so $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$. [step 2.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Statement

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a \le b$. Then the closed bounded interval
$[a,b]$ ([[def-interval]]) is compact ([[def-open-cover-r]]): every family of
open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ whose union contains $[a,b]$ has a finite subfamily
whose union already contains $[a,b]$.

The proof is by repeated bisection. Supposing some open cover admits no finite
subcover, one halves the interval, keeps a half that still admits none, and
iterates; the halves shrink to a point, which the cover does reach, and a single
member of the cover then swallows a whole late-stage half. **The halving rule is
canonical**, taking the left half whenever the left half works, so the recursion
uses [[thm-recursion]] and no choice principle.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a \le b$ and an open cover $\mathcal{U}$ of $[a,b]$; the set $X := \{\, (u,v) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} : u \le v \,\}$; and the following terminology: a pair $(u,v) \in X$ is **bad** when there are no $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $U_0, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{U}$ with $[u,v] \subseteq U_0 \cup \dots \cup U_n$, that is, when the interval $[u,v]$ admits no finite subcover from $\mathcal{U}$.

[L1] Open cover, subcover, finite subfamily and compactness ([[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L2] Closed bounded intervals: $[u,v] = \{\, z : u \le z \le v \,\}$ is nonempty exactly when $u \le v$; and for $u \le m \le v$ one has $[u,v] = [u,m] \cup [m,v]$, since $z \in [u,v]$ satisfies $z \le m$ or $m < z$ by trichotomy ([[def-interval]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$, and $N_\varepsilon(x) = \{\, y : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L4] Recursion: for a set $Y$, an element $y_0 \in Y$ and a function $G : Y \to Y$ there is $h : \mathbb{N} \to Y$ with $h(0) = y_0$ and $h(k+1) = G(h(k))$ for every $k$ ([[thm-recursion]]).

[L5] Nested interval property: if $[a_k,b_k]$ with $a_k \le b_k$ satisfy $[a_{k+1},b_{k+1}] \subseteq [a_k,b_k]$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, then $\bigcap_{k} [a_k,b_k] \ne \varnothing$ ([[thm-nested-interval-property]]).

[L6] Reciprocal Archimedean property: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]]).

[L7] Canonical naturals: $n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} > 0$ for $n \ge 1$, the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ is strictly increasing, and $(n+1) \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} = n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} + 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]); a positive element has a positive inverse and $0 < c \le d$ gives $0 < 1/d \le 1/c$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

[L8] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, hence $2 := 1 + 1 > 0$ and $2^{-1} > 0$; adding a constant preserves an inequality and multiplying by a positive preserves it ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

[L9] Absolute value: $|y - x| \le v - u$ whenever $x, y \in [u,v]$, because $|y - x|$ equals $y - x$ or $x - y$ and each is at most $v - u$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $[a,b]$ is not compact: some open cover $\mathcal{U}$ of $[a,b]$ has no finite subcover, that is, the pair $(a,b) \in X$ is bad. [assume-contra, L1]

1.2 Bisection rule: for $(u,v) \in X$ put $m := (u+v) \cdot 2^{-1}$, so that $u \le m \le v$ by [L8], and define $G(u,v) := (u,m)$ if $(u,m)$ is bad and $G(u,v) := (m,v)$ otherwise. This is a definition by cases on one condition, so $G : X \to X$ is a function and nothing is selected. [L2, L8, construct]

1.3 If $(u,v)$ is bad then $G(u,v)$ is bad: were both $(u,m)$ and $(m,v)$ not bad, concatenating the two finite lists of members of $\mathcal{U}$ would give a finite subfamily whose union contains $[u,m] \cup [m,v] = [u,v]$ by [L2], so $(u,v)$ would not be bad; hence at least one half is bad, and the rule returns the left half when it is bad and otherwise the right half, which must then be bad. [L1, L2]

2.1 Apply [L4] with $Y = X$, seed $(a,b)$ and map $G$: there is $h : \mathbb{N} \to X$ with $h(0) = (a,b)$ and $h(k+1) = G(h(k))$. Write $h(k) = (a_k,b_k)$, so $a_k \le b_k$ for every $k$, $(a_0,b_0) = (a,b)$, and $(a_{k+1},b_{k+1})$ is one of the two halves of $(a_k,b_k)$. [step 1.2, L2, L4, construct]

3.1 Every $(a_k,b_k)$ is bad, by induction on $k$: the case $k = 0$ is step 1.1, and if $(a_k,b_k)$ is bad then $(a_{k+1},b_{k+1}) = G(a_k,b_k)$ is bad by step 1.3. [step 1.1, step 1.3, step 2.1]

3.2 Writing $\ell_k := b_k - a_k \ge 0$, the intervals are nested and the lengths halve: $[a_{k+1},b_{k+1}]$ is $[a_k,m_k]$ or $[m_k,b_k]$ with $m_k = (a_k+b_k) \cdot 2^{-1}$, and each of these is contained in $[a_k,b_k]$ by [L2], while $m_k - a_k = b_k - m_k = \ell_k \cdot 2^{-1}$, so $\ell_{k+1} = \ell_k \cdot 2^{-1}$. [step 2.1, L2, L8]

4.1 For every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ one has $\ell_k \cdot (k+1) \le \ell_0$, by induction on $k$: at $k = 0$ this reads $\ell_0 \cdot 1 \le \ell_0$; and if it holds at $k$ then $\ell_{k+1} \cdot (k+2) = \ell_k \cdot 2^{-1} \cdot (k+2) \le \ell_k \cdot (k+1) \le \ell_0$, using $\ell_k \ge 0$ and $(k+2) \cdot 2^{-1} \le k+1$, which is $k + 2 \le 2k+2$, that is $0 \le k$. [step 3.2, L7, L8]

4.2 By [L5] the nested family $[a_k,b_k]$ of nonempty closed bounded intervals has a common point $x$; since $x \in [a_0,b_0] = [a,b]$ and $\mathcal{U}$ covers $[a,b]$, fix $U \in \mathcal{U}$ with $x \in U$ and then, $U$ being open, a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$. [step 3.2, L1, L2, L3, L5, choose]

5.1 There is $k \in \mathbb{N}$ with $\ell_k < \varepsilon$: the real $\varepsilon/(\ell_0+1)$ is positive because $\ell_0 + 1 > 0$, so [L6] supplies a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon/(\ell_0+1)$; put $k := n-1$, a natural number, so that $k+1 = n$ and step 4.1 with [L7] gives $\ell_k \le \ell_0 \cdot (1/n) \le \ell_0 \cdot \varepsilon/(\ell_0+1) < \varepsilon$, the last step because $\ell_0 < \ell_0 + 1$ forces $\ell_0/(\ell_0+1) < 1$ and $\varepsilon > 0$. [step 4.1, step 4.2, L6, L7, L8, choose]

6.1 For that $k$ one has $x \in [a_k,b_k]$, and every $y \in [a_k,b_k]$ satisfies $|y - x| \le \ell_k < \varepsilon$ by [L9], so $[a_k,b_k] \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; hence the one-member subfamily $\{U\}$ of $\mathcal{U}$ covers $[a_k,b_k]$ and $(a_k,b_k)$ is not bad, contradicting step 3.1. The assumption of step 1.1 is therefore untenable and $[a,b]$ is compact. [step 3.1, step 4.2, step 5.1, L1, L3, L9, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **What each hypothesis buys.** Closedness enters through [L5]: the nested
  interval property is stated for closed intervals and fails for open ones
  ([[cex-nested-open-intervals-empty]]). Boundedness enters through the same
  fact and through the length computation of step 3.2. Completeness of
  $\mathbb{R}$ enters only inside [[thm-nested-interval-property]] and, through
  [[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], in step 5.1.

- **Why the lengths are handled without powers.** The obvious route is
  $\ell_k = \ell_0 \cdot 2^{-k}$ together with the nullity of a geometric
  sequence, which is available ([[lem-geometric-sequence-null]]). The route
  taken instead, the one-line induction of step 4.1, gives the weaker bound
  $\ell_k \le \ell_0/(k+1)$, which is all step 5.1 needs, and it avoids
  integer powers and the algebra of limits entirely.

- **The recursion is over pairs, not over sets.** The state carried from stage
  to stage is the pair of endpoints, so [L4] applies with $Y = X$ and a total
  map $G$; had the rule been "choose a bad half", the state would have been
  chosen rather than computed and the argument would have needed dependent
  choice, which this library does not have.

- **The converse direction is a separate result.** That a compact subset of
  $\mathbb{R}$ must be closed and bounded is
  [[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]], and the two together give
  [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]].

## Statement

Let $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be compact ([[def-open-cover-r]]) and let
$f : K \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $K$ ([[def-continuity-real]]). Then $f$
is uniformly continuous on $K$ ([[def-uniform-continuity-real]]).

**This theorem is stated twice in this library, on purpose.** Its metric-space
twin is [[thm-heine-cantor-metric]], proved there from the cover machinery of
metric spaces; the proof below is $\mathbb{R}$-native and runs through
[[thm-compact-iff-sequentially-compact-r]], which is order-based. That the two
statements are the same statement in two vocabularies is
[[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]], clauses 1, 2 and 5, immediately above.

**The choice cost, named.** The proof invokes the axiom of countable choice
([[def-countable-choice]]) exactly once, at step 3.1, to select one bad pair of
points from each of countably many nonempty sets. The backward implication of
[[thm-compact-iff-sequentially-compact-r]] also spends countable choice, and
that item names its own uses; the forward implication used here, from compact to
sequentially compact, does not. No claim is made that the axiom is necessary
for either.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A compact set $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a function $f : K \to \mathbb{R}$ continuous on $K$.

[L1] Uniform continuity on $K$: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that all $x, x' \in K$ with $|x - x'| < \delta$ satisfy $|f(x) - f(x')| < \varepsilon$. Its negation: there is a real $\varepsilon_0 > 0$ such that for every real $\delta > 0$ some pair $x, x' \in K$ has $|x - x'| < \delta$ and $|f(x) - f(x')| \ge \varepsilon_0$ ([[def-uniform-continuity-real]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] A compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is sequentially compact: every sequence with all terms in $K$ has a subsequence converging to a point of $K$ ([[thm-compact-iff-sequentially-compact-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]], [[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L3] Countable choice: for a family $(P_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of nonempty sets there is a function on $\mathbb{N}$ picking an element of each ([[def-countable-choice]]).

[L4] A strictly increasing index map satisfies $n_j \ge j$ ([[lem-index-map-grows]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L5] Archimedean property in reciprocal form: for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \eta$; and $0 < s \le t$ implies $1/t \le 1/s$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

[L6] Sequential criterion, the choice-free direction: if $f$ is continuous at $p \in K$ and $(z_j)$ has terms in $K$ with $z_j \to p$, then $f(z_j) \to f(p)$ ([[thm-sequential-criterion-for-continuity]], [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L7] Triangle inequality and absolute value: $|u + v| \le |u| + |v|$, $|{-u}| = |u|$, $|u| \ge 0$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L8] Convergence of real sequences is tested at rational $\varepsilon > 0$, and below every positive real lies a positive rational, so the test may equally be run at every real $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-real-limit]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose $f$ is not uniformly continuous on $K$. By [L1] fix a real $\varepsilon_0 > 0$ such that for every real $\delta > 0$ there are $x, x' \in K$ with $|x - x'| < \delta$ and $|f(x) - f(x')| \ge \varepsilon_0$. [L1, assume-contra]

2.1 For $k \in \mathbb{N}$ put $P_k := \{\, (x,x') \in K \times K \ : \ |x - x'| < 1/(k+1) \text{ and } |f(x) - f(x')| \ge \varepsilon_0 \,\}$. Since $1/(k+1) > 0$, step 1.1 makes every $P_k$ nonempty. [step 1.1, L5]

3.1 By [L3] applied to the family $(P_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ fix a function $k \mapsto (x_k, x'_k)$ with $(x_k, x'_k) \in P_k$ for every $k$. **This is the single use of countable choice in this proof.** [step 2.1, L3, choose]

4.1 $(x_k)$ is a sequence of reals with all terms in $K$, so by [L2] there are a strictly increasing $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ and $p \in K$ with $x_{n_j} \to p$. [step 3.1, L2, choose]

5.1 **The second sequence converges to $p$ as well.** Let a rational $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. By [L5] and [L8] fix $J_1$ with $1/(j+1) < \varepsilon/2$ for every $j \ge J_1$, and by step 4.1 fix $J_2$ with $|x_{n_j} - p| < \varepsilon/2$ for every $j \ge J_2$. For $j \ge \max\{J_1, J_2\}$, using $(x_{n_j}, x'_{n_j}) \in P_{n_j}$ and $n_j \ge j$ from [L4], we get $|x'_{n_j} - x_{n_j}| < 1/(n_j+1) \le 1/(j+1) < \varepsilon/2$, hence $|x'_{n_j} - p| \le |x'_{n_j} - x_{n_j}| + |x_{n_j} - p| < \varepsilon$ by [L7]. So $x'_{n_j} \to p$. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L4, L5, L7, L8]

6.1 The point $p$ lies in $K$ and $f$ is continuous at $p$, so [L6] applied to the two sequences of steps 4.1 and 5.1, both with terms in $K$, gives $f(x_{n_j}) \to f(p)$ and $f(x'_{n_j}) \to f(p)$. [step 4.1, step 5.1, L6]

7.1 By [L8] fix a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \varepsilon_0/2$, and by step 6.1 fix $J$ with $|f(x_{n_j}) - f(p)| < \varepsilon$ and $|f(x'_{n_j}) - f(p)| < \varepsilon$ for every $j \ge J$. For such $j$, [L7] gives $|f(x_{n_j}) - f(x'_{n_j})| \le |f(x_{n_j}) - f(p)| + |f(p) - f(x'_{n_j})| < 2\varepsilon < \varepsilon_0$. [step 6.1, L7, L8, choose]

8.1 But $(x_{n_j}, x'_{n_j}) \in P_{n_j}$ gives $|f(x_{n_j}) - f(x'_{n_j})| \ge \varepsilon_0$ for every $j$, which contradicts step 7.1. The assumption of step 1.1 is therefore false, and $f$ is uniformly continuous on $K$. [step 3.1, step 7.1, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where compactness is used, and where continuity is used.** Compactness is used once, in step 4.1, to extract a convergent subsequence; continuity is used once, in step 6.1, at the single point $p$ that the extraction produces. Neither can be weakened: $x \mapsto 1/x$ on $(0,1)$ is continuous on a bounded non-closed set and not uniformly continuous ([[cex-one-over-x-is-not-uniformly-continuous-on-the-unit-interval]]), and $x \mapsto x^{2}$ on $\mathbb{R}$ is continuous on a closed unbounded set and not uniformly continuous ([[cex-x-squared-is-not-uniformly-continuous-on-r]]).

- **The converse is sharp.** For every noncompact $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ that is bounded there is a continuous function on $E$ that is not uniformly continuous, and for every noncompact $E$ there is an unbounded continuous function and a bounded continuous one with no greatest value. That is [[thm-compactness-is-necessary-for-evt-and-uniform-continuity]], later on this page, and together with this theorem it says that compactness is exactly the hypothesis these results need.

- **The pairs, not the points, are what is chosen.** A common presentation selects two sequences separately and then extracts twice. Selecting the pair once, as above, keeps the count of choice applications at one and makes the second sequence's convergence a consequence rather than a second extraction.

## Statement

Every complete ordered field $F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) is Archimedean:
for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$,
where $n \cdot 1_F$ is the canonical natural of the ordered field $F$
([[def-ordered-field]]). Equivalently, the canonical naturals are cofinal in $F$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $F$; write $A = \{\, n \cdot 1_F : n \ge 1 \,\}$ for the set of its canonical naturals.

[L1] Least-upper-bound property: every nonempty $S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound $\sup S \in F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Each canonical natural satisfies $n \cdot 1_F > 0$, one has $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L3] $0 < 1_F$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $F$ is not Archimedean: there is some $x \in F$ with $n \cdot 1_F \le x$ for all $n \ge 1$, that is, $x$ is an upper bound of $A$. [assume-contra]

2.1 The set $A$ is nonempty, since $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F \in A$, and it is bounded above by $x$. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 By the least-upper-bound property, $A$ has a least upper bound $s = \sup A \in F$. [step 2.1, L1]

4.1 Since $1_F > 0$, we have $s - 1_F < s$; as $s$ is the least upper bound, $s - 1_F$ is not an upper bound of $A$. [step 3.1, L3]

5.1 Hence there is some $m \ge 1$ with $m \cdot 1_F > s - 1_F$. [step 4.1]

6.1 Adding $1_F$ to both sides, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F > s$. [step 5.1, L2]

7.1 But $(m+1) \cdot 1_F \in A$, so $(m+1) \cdot 1_F \le s$ because $s$ is an upper bound of $A$, contradicting 6.1. [step 6.1, step 3.1, L2]

8.1 The assumption is therefore untenable, so $F$ is Archimedean. [step 7.1, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]). Then $f$ is Darboux integrable on $[a,b]$
([[def-darboux-integral]]) **if and only if**

$$\text{for every real } \varepsilon > 0 \text{ there is a partition } P \text{ of } [a,b] \text{ with } U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$$

([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

**This is the criterion every later integrability proof on this page uses.** It
replaces a statement about a supremum and an infimum over all partitions, which
cannot be checked directly, by the exhibition of a **single** partition for each
$\varepsilon$. The criterion says nothing about the value of the integral; that
is located separately, by [[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]], between $L(f,P)$
and $U(f,P)$ for the same $P$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and a bounded $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$.

[A1] The criterion: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a partition $P$ of $[a,b]$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$.

[L1] $L(f,P) \le \underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,P)$ for every partition $P$; $\underline{\int_a^b} f = \sup \mathcal{L}$ and $\overline{\int_a^b} f = \inf \mathcal{U}$ over the nonempty sets $\mathcal{L}$ of lower sums and $\mathcal{U}$ of upper sums; $f$ is integrable exactly when the two are equal ([[def-darboux-integral]], [[def-darboux-sums]]).

[L2] $\varepsilon$-characterisation of the supremum: if $u = \sup S$ with $S$ nonempty then for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $s \in S$ with $s > u - \varepsilon$ ([[lem-sup-epsilon]]). Dually, if $\ell = \inf S$ then for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $s \in S$ with $s < \ell + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-inf-epsilon]], [[def-infimum]]).

[L3] If $P'$ refines $P$ then $L(f,P) \le L(f,P')$ and $U(f,P') \le U(f,P)$; the common refinement $P_1 \vee P_2$ refines both $P_1$ and $P_2$ ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L4] Ordered-field arithmetic: adding a constant to both sides preserves an inequality, the order is total and transitive, and $t \cdot 2^{-1} > 0$ for $t > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Write $D := \overline{\int_a^b} f - \underline{\int_a^b} f$, a real number with $D \ge 0$ by [L1]; $f$ is integrable exactly when $D = 0$. [L1]

1.2 **The criterion is sufficient.** Assume [A1] and let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. Fix a partition $P$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$. By [L1], $\underline{\int_a^b} f \ge L(f,P)$ and $\overline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,P)$, so $D \le U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$. [A1, L1, L4, choose]

1.3 **The criterion is necessary; this half of the proof is steps 1.3, 2.2 and 3.1, and its symbols are its own.** Assume $f$ is integrable and write $I$ for the common value $\underline{\int_a^b} f = \overline{\int_a^b} f$. Let a real $\eta > 0$ be given; then $\eta \cdot 2^{-1} > 0$ by [L4]. [L1, L4]

2.1 So $0 \le D < \varepsilon$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$. If $D > 0$, taking $\varepsilon := D$ gives $D < D$, which is false; hence $D = 0$ and $f$ is integrable by step 1.1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L4]

2.2 By [L2] applied to $\mathcal{L}$, whose supremum is $I$, there is a partition $P_1$ with $L(f,P_1) > I - \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$; by [L2] applied to $\mathcal{U}$, whose infimum is $I$, there is a partition $P_2$ with $U(f,P_2) < I + \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$. [step 1.3, L1, L2, choose]

3.1 Put $P_{\ast} := P_1 \vee P_2$, which refines both by [L3]. Then $L(f,P_{\ast}) \ge L(f,P_1) > I - \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$ and $U(f,P_{\ast}) \le U(f,P_2) < I + \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$, so $U(f,P_{\ast}) - L(f,P_{\ast}) < \eta$ by [L4]. Since $\eta > 0$ was arbitrary, the criterion holds. [step 2.2, L3, L4]

4.1 Steps 1.2 and 2.1 give the implication from the criterion to integrability, and steps 1.3, 2.2 and 3.1 give the converse; the two halves are independent and use no symbol in common, and together they are the stated equivalence. [step 2.1, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The strict inequality is not essential.** Requiring $U(f,P) - L(f,P) \le \varepsilon$ for every $\varepsilon > 0$ defines the same condition, since a partition working for $\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$ works strictly for $\varepsilon$. Statements below use whichever form is convenient and no consequence turns on the difference.

- **The common refinement is where the two partitions are reconciled.** Step 2.2 produces one partition good for the lower sum and another good for the upper sum, and there is no reason for them to be the same. [[lem-refinement-inequalities]] is exactly what allows a single partition to inherit both properties, and it is the only place in this proof where anything beyond the definitions is used.

- **No choice principle is used.** Steps 1.2, 2.2 and 3.1 instantiate finitely many existential statements, which is ordinary first-order reasoning. See [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].
