You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as
an independent adversarial proof-refuter. Return evidence only; Audit-Alpha
alone adjudicates and edits.

## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` Statement or counterexample, actively search for a
counterexample to the public claim or a failure in the witness. A false public
claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or materially
inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is nonfatal.

Return no more than 450 words, exactly in this shape:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

For each defect:

```text
FINDING 1
  location: [exact section/fact/step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [exact assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]
```

Always end with:

```text
BOUNDARY: [specific boundary/counterexample checks and disposition]
SOURCES:  [confirm every supplied cited item used by the target was inspected]
CHECKED:  [confirm title, public claim, every numbered step, and Remarks]

## Example

For $f(x)=1/(1-x)$ and $n\in\mathbb N$,
$$T_{n,0}f(x)=\sum_{j=0}^{n}x^j,\qquad R_{n,0}f(x)=\frac{x^{n+1}}{1-x}$$
whenever $x\ne1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The geometric function.

[L1] Finite geometric sums follow from [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]. Derivative algebra, the chain rule, and the natural-power derivative give the successive derivatives of $(1-x)^{-1}$; factorial arithmetic is preserved by the canonical embedding ([[thm-algebra-of-derivatives]], [[thm-chain-rule]], [[lem-derivative-of-a-power]], [[def-factorial-and-falling-factorial]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]), and induction is [[thm-induction-principle]].

[L2] The Taylor objects and bound are [[def-taylor-polynomial-and-remainder]] and [[cor-taylor-remainder-bound]].

## Verification

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Induction gives $f^{(j)}(x)=\iota(j!)(1-x)^{-j-1}$, hence $f^{(j)}(0)/\iota(j!)=1$.  [L1]

2.1 Multiplying $\sum_{j=0}^{n}x^j$ by $1-x$ telescopes to $1-x^{n+1}$. Subtracting from $1/(1-x)$ gives the stated remainder.  [step 1.1, L1, algebra]

3.1 This exact expression agrees with the qualitative estimate supplied by [L2] on every closed interval avoiding $1$.  [step 2.1, L2] ∎

## Statement

Let $n\in\mathbb N$, and suppose $f$ has derivatives through order $n+1$ on the closed interval between $a$ and $x$, with the usual endpoint continuity. If $|f^{(n+1)}(t)|\le M$ throughout that interval, then
$$|R_{n,a}f(x)|\le \frac{M}{\iota((n+1)!)}|x-a|^{n+1}.$$

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The stated regularity and derivative bound.

[L1] The Lagrange remainder formula is [[cor-taylor-lagrange-and-cauchy-remainders]].

[L2] Absolute value respects products and powers ([[lem-of-abs-value]]), and factorials are positive ([[def-factorial-and-falling-factorial]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[def-canonical-natural]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 If $x=a$, then $R_{n,a}f(a)=0$, so the estimate is immediate. If $x\ne a$, [L1] gives $$R_{n,a}f(x)=\frac{f^{(n+1)}(\xi)}{\iota((n+1)!)}(x-a)^{n+1}$$ for some point $\xi$ strictly between $a$ and $x$.  [L1]

2.1 In the case $x\ne a$, take absolute values in step 1.1, use $|f^{(n+1)}(\xi)|\le M$, and divide by the positive factorial. Together with the case $x=a$, this proves the estimate.  [step 1.1, L2, algebra] ∎

## Definition

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]) with additive identity $0_F$ and
multiplicative identity $1_F$. Define
$\iota : \mathbb{N} \to F$ by recursion on $\mathbb{N}$
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[thm-recursion]]):

$$\iota(0) \;:=\; 0_F, \qquad \iota(n+1) \;:=\; \iota(n) + 1_F .$$

$\iota(n)$ is the **canonical natural** of $n$ in $F$. It is also written
$n \cdot 1_F$, and for $n \ge 1$ it is $1_F$ added to itself $n$ times.

**Why the notation is needed at all.** A natural number in this library is a von
Neumann natural, that is a set ([[def-natural-numbers]]), and a set is not an
element of $F$. So $1/n$, $n^{\alpha}$ and $x/n$ are not expressions of $F$ when
$n$ is a natural: what they mean is $1/\iota(n)$, $\iota(n)^{\alpha}$ and
$x/\iota(n)$. The map $\iota$ is what carries a counting number into the field,
and writing it is the whole reason a reader meets $1/\iota(k+1)$ where an
informal text would write $1/(k+1)$.

## Remarks

- **Where the index shift comes from.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
  ([[def-natural-numbers]]) and $\iota(0) = 0_F$, so $1/\iota(k)$ is undefined at
  $k = 0$. A family of reciprocals indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ is therefore written
  over $\iota(k+1)$, which is why the harmonic and telescoping families of this
  library run over $k+1$ rather than over $k$. This is bookkeeping, not a
  restriction: the values are the usual ones.

- **This definition records notation; the arithmetic is proved elsewhere.** That
  $\iota$ is strictly increasing and positive on $n \ge 1$, and that it carries
  sums to sums and products to products, is [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], stated
  for an ordered field. That lemma introduces the same element by the equivalent
  recursion $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, which
  agrees with the definition above because $\iota(1) = \iota(0) + 1_F = 1_F$.
  Nothing here is new mathematics; the definition exists so that the notation has
  a home a reader can look up.

- **The symbol $\iota$ is used in this library for other canonical maps, and this
  definition does not govern them.** It also denotes the canonical field
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to F$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), the isometric
  embedding of a metric space into a completion ([[def-metric-completion]]), and
  an inclusion map $\iota : S \to X$ of a subspace. Each of those is introduced
  where it is used and means something different from the map defined here. What
  the four share is only that each is the canonical map of its situation.

- **Fields, not just ordered fields.** The recursion needs no order, so the
  definition is stated for a field; every use in this library is in an ordered
  field, and the order is what makes $\iota$ injective
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). In a field of positive characteristic $\iota$
  is not injective, which is one reason the injectivity is a lemma rather than
  part of the definition.

## Definition

**The factorial.** By the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) applied to the
set $\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$, the starting element $(0,1)$ and the function
$f(k, v) = (\sigma(k),\, v \cdot \sigma(k))$, and by the same induction on the
first coordinate as in [[def-nat-finite-sum-and-product]], there is a unique
$F : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ with

$$F(0) = 1, \qquad F(\sigma(n)) = F(n)\cdot\sigma(n) \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

We write $n! := F(n)$. Thus $0! = 1$, $1! = 0!\cdot 1 = 1$, $2! = 1!\cdot 2 = 2$,
$3! = 6$, $4! = 24$, $5! = 120$, $6! = 720$.

**$0! = 1$ is the base clause of this recursion**, not a convention imported from
elsewhere. Nothing about empty products is presupposed; the agreement with the
empty product is proved below, in clause (a), rather than assumed.

**Truncated difference.** Throughout, $n - k$ is the operation fixed in
[[def-nat-finite-sum-and-product]]: the unique $j$ with $k + j = n$ when
$k \le n$, and $0$ when $n < k$.

**The falling factorial.** For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ define $n^{\underline{k}}$ by
recursion on $k$, by the recursion theorem applied to
$\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ with starting element $(0,1)$ and
$f(k, v) = (\sigma(k),\, v \cdot (n-k))$:

$$n^{\underline{0}} = 1, \qquad n^{\underline{\sigma(k)}} = n^{\underline{k}}\cdot(n-k) .$$

So $n^{\underline{1}} = 1\cdot(n-0) = n$ and $n^{\underline{2}} = n\,(n-1)$, and
for $k \le n$ the value is the product $n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1)$ of the $k$ topmost
factors.

**Four facts, proved here because the page uses each of them.**

**(a) The factorial is the product of the first $n$ positive naturals.**
$n! = \prod_{j<n}\sigma(j) = \prod_{j<n}(j+1)$, the $\mathbb{N}$-valued product of
[[def-nat-finite-sum-and-product]]. Induction ([[thm-induction-principle]]): at
$n = 0$ both sides are $1$, the empty product and the base clause agreeing; and
$\prod_{j<\sigma(n)}\sigma(j) = \big(\prod_{j<n}\sigma(j)\big)\cdot\sigma(n) = n!\cdot\sigma(n) = \sigma(n)!$.
**So the empty-product reading and the base-clause reading are the same reading**,
and neither was assumed.

**(b) $n! \ne 0$, and $\iota(n!) = \prod^{\mathbb{R}}_{j<n}\iota(j+1)$.** For the
first, $0! = 1 \ne 0$ ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]) and
$\sigma(n)! = n!\cdot\sigma(n)$ is a product of two nonzero naturals, which is
nonzero: if $xy = 0$ with $y \ne 0$ then $xy = 0\cdot y$
([[lem-nat-mult-identity]]) and cancellation gives $x = 0$
([[lem-nat-mult-cancellative]]). So $n! \ne 0$ for every $n$ by induction. For the second, apply the bridge clause
6 of that lemma to clause (a) above. This is what makes the factorial of this
page and the real-valued product $\prod_{j<n}(j+1)$ used elsewhere in the library
**one object seen twice**, rather than two unrelated notions.

**(c) $n^{\underline{k}}\cdot(n-k)! = n!$ for $k \le n$.** Induction on $k$, for
all $n$ at once. At $k = 0$ this reads $1 \cdot n! = n!$. Assume it at $k$ and
let $\sigma(k) \le n$; then $k \le n$, and writing $d := n - k$ we have
$k + d = n$ and $d \ne 0$, since $k + 0 = k \ne n$; so $d = \sigma(e)$ for a
unique $e$ ([[lem-nat-nonzero-is-successor]]), and $\sigma(k) + e = n$, that is
$e = n - \sigma(k)$ ([[lem-nat-add-cancellative]]). Therefore
$n^{\underline{\sigma(k)}}\cdot\big(n-\sigma(k)\big)! = n^{\underline{k}}\cdot(n-k)\cdot e! = n^{\underline{k}}\cdot\big(e!\cdot\sigma(e)\big) = n^{\underline{k}}\cdot\sigma(e)! = n^{\underline{k}}\cdot(n-k)! = n!$,
using commutativity and associativity of multiplication
([[lem-nat-mult-associative]], [[lem-nat-mult-commutative]]) and the recursion
clause for the factorial.

**(d) Boundary values.** $n^{\underline{0}} = 1$ for every $n$, by the base
clause; $n^{\underline{n}} = n!$, since clause (c) at $k = n$ gives
$n^{\underline{n}}\cdot 0! = n!$ and $0! = 1$; and
$n^{\underline{k}} = 0$ whenever $k > n$. For the last, $n - n = 0$ gives
$n^{\underline{\sigma(n)}} = n^{\underline{n}}\cdot 0 = 0$, the clause
$x \cdot 0 = 0$ being definitional ([[def-nat-multiplication]]), and if
$n^{\underline{k}} = 0$ then
$n^{\underline{\sigma(k)}} = 0$ as well, so $n^{\underline{k}} = 0$ for every
$k \ge \sigma(n)$ by induction.

## Remarks

- **Why $0! = 1$ is not imported.** The empty-product convention of an arbitrary
  monoid is fixed in [[def-monoid-finite-product]], which comes later in the
  reading order, so citing it here would be a dependency pointing the wrong way.
  Taking $0! = 1$ as the base clause of the factorial's own recursion costs
  nothing and owes nothing, and clause (a) then records the agreement.

- **The library's other factorial.** [[lem-factorial-beats-geometric]], later in
  the reading order, works with a real-valued factorial defined as the product
  $\prod_{j<n}(j+1)$ in $\mathbb{R}$. Clause (b) says that this is exactly
  $\iota(n!)$, so the two agree and no second notion has been created. That
  pointer is orientation only.

- **Check every clause at $k = 0$ and at $k = n$.** The falling factorial is
  defined by two regimes, one for $k \le n$ and one beyond, and the recursion
  above covers both because the truncated difference is $0$ past the end. The
  two values that get used constantly are $n^{\underline{0}} = 1$ and
  $n^{\underline{n}} = n!$, and both are clause (d).

## Definition

Let $n\in\mathbb N$, let $f$ have derivatives through order $n$ at $a$, and let $\iota:\mathbb N\to\mathbb R$ be the canonical embedding. The **Taylor polynomial of degree at most $n$ about $a$** is
$$T_{n,a}f(x):=\sum_{j=0}^{n}\frac{f^{(j)}(a)}{\iota(j!)}(x-a)^j.$$
The **Taylor remainder** is $R_{n,a}f(x):=f(x)-T_{n,a}f(x)$.

The factorials are natural numbers as in [[def-factorial-and-falling-factorial]] and enter real arithmetic only through $\iota$ ([[def-canonical-natural]]); they are nonzero ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). The sum and powers are those of [[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], and [[def-integer-power]]. For $n=0$, $T_{0,a}f$ is the constant $f(a)$.

## Statement

Powers are those of [[def-integer-power]], and $\iota : \mathbb{N} \to
\mathbb{R}$ is the canonical natural of [[def-canonical-natural]], so that
$\iota(0) = 0$ and $\iota(m+1) = \iota(m) + 1$. Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

1. The function $p_0 : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, $p_0(x) = x^{0}$, is the
   constant function $1$, and it is differentiable at every $c \in \mathbb{R}$
   with $p_0'(c) = 0$ ([[def-derivative]]).
2. For $n \ge 1$ the function $p_n : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$,
   $p_n(x) = x^{n}$, is differentiable at every $c \in \mathbb{R}$, and
   $$p_n'(c) \;=\; \iota(n)\,c^{\,n-1} .$$
3. For $n \ge 1$ put $A_0 := \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \ne 0 \,\}$. The function
   $m_n : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$, $m_n(x) = x^{-n}$, is differentiable at every
   $c \in A_0$ as a function on $A_0$, and
   $$m_n'(c) \;=\; -\,\iota(n)\,c^{\,-n-1} .$$
4. Let $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with $a_j = 0$ for $j \ge n$, and let
   $P : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be the polynomial function
   $P(x) = \sum_{j<n} a_j x^{j}$ ([[def-finite-sum]]). Then $P$ is
   differentiable at every $c \in \mathbb{R}$, and, defining $e : \mathbb{N}
   \to \mathbb{R}$ by $e_0 := 0$ and $e_j := \iota(j)\,a_j\,c^{\,j-1}$ for
   $j \ge 1$,
   $$P'(c) \;=\; \sum_{j<n} e_j .$$

**Claim 2 is stated for $n \ge 1$ and not for $n \ge 0$, and that is not
timidity.** At $n = 0$ its right-hand side reads $\iota(0)\,c^{-1}$, and
$c^{-1}$ is not defined at $c = 0$ ([[def-integer-power]]), so the formula is
not a statement about the whole line. Claim 1 is what covers $n = 0$, and it
says the derivative is $0$ there, which is what the informal reading
"$0 \cdot c^{-1}$" is reaching for. The same shift is why the term $e_0$ of
claim 4 is defined to be $0$ outright rather than by the formula.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural $n$, a real $c$, and the functions $p_n$, $m_n$ and $P$ of the statement.

[L1] Powers ([[def-integer-power]]): $a^{0} = 1$ and $a^{m+1} = a^{m}a$ for every $a \in \mathbb{R}$ and $m \in \mathbb{N}$; $a^{-m} := (a^{m})^{-1}$ for $a \ne 0$ and $m \ge 1$; and $0^{m} = 0$ for $m \ge 1$.

[L2] Canonical naturals ([[def-canonical-natural]]): $\iota(0) = 0$, $\iota(m+1) = \iota(m) + 1$, and hence $\iota(1) = 1$.

[L3] Algebra of derivatives ([[thm-algebra-of-derivatives]]): at a limit point $c$ of the common domain, sums, scalar multiples and products of functions differentiable at $c$ are differentiable at $c$ with the four stated formulas, and if the denominator is nonzero at $c$ then the quotient, restricted to the set where the denominator does not vanish, is differentiable at $c$ with the quotient formula; that restricted set has $c$ as a limit point.

[L4] Derivative and difference quotient ([[def-derivative]]): $f$ is differentiable at a limit point $c$ of its domain $D$ exactly when the difference quotient $x \mapsto (f(x)-f(c))/(x-c)$, a function on $D \setminus \{c\}$, has a limit at $c$, and $f'(c)$ is that limit. A constant function $h \equiv K$ on a set having $c$ as a limit point has $\lim_{x \to c} h(x) = K$: given a real $\varepsilon > 0$, any real $\delta > 0$ serves, since $|K - K| = 0 < \varepsilon$ ([[def-function-limit]]).

[L5] Induction principle on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L6] Finite sums ([[def-finite-sum]]): $\sum_{j<0} b_j = 0$ and $\sum_{j<m+1} b_j = \bigl(\sum_{j<m} b_j\bigr) + b_m$.

[L7] Integer exponent laws for a nonzero base ([[lem-power-laws]]): $a^{k} \ne 0$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ when $a \ne 0$; and for integers $j, k$ one has $a^{j}a^{k} = a^{j+k}$, $(a^{j})^{k} = a^{jk}$ and $a^{-k} = (a^{k})^{-1}$.

[L8] Every real is a limit point of $\mathbb{R}$, punctured neighbourhoods in $\mathbb{R}$ being never empty ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 **Base case, claim 2 at $n = 1$.** By [L1], $x^{1} = x^{0}x = 1 \cdot x = x$, so $p_1$ is the identity. Fix $c \in \mathbb{R}$; for every $x \ne c$ the difference quotient is $(x - c)/(x - c) = 1$, so it is the constant function $1$ on $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{c\}$, and by [L4] and [L8] its limit at $c$ is $1$. Since $\iota(1)c^{0} = 1 \cdot 1 = 1$ by [L1] and [L2], claim 2 holds at $n = 1$. [base, L1, L2, L4, L8]

1.2 **Inductive hypothesis.** Fix a natural $n \ge 1$ and assume that $p_n$ is differentiable at every $c \in \mathbb{R}$ with $p_n'(c) = \iota(n)c^{\,n-1}$. [ih]

1.3 **Claim 1.** By [L1] the function $p_0$ is the constant function $1$. Fix $c \in \mathbb{R}$; for every $x \ne c$ its difference quotient is $(1-1)/(x-c) = 0$, the constant function $0$ on $\mathbb{R}\setminus\{c\}$, whose limit at $c$ is $0$ by [L4] and [L8]. So $p_0$ is differentiable at every $c$ with $p_0'(c) = 0$. [L1, L4, L8]

2.1 **Successor step.** Let $c \in \mathbb{R}$. By [L1], $p_{n+1}(x) = x^{n+1} = x^{n}x = p_n(x)\,p_1(x)$ for every $x$. Both factors are differentiable at $c$, by step 1.2 and step 1.1, so the product rule of [L3] gives that $p_{n+1}$ is differentiable at $c$ with $p_{n+1}'(c) = p_n'(c)p_1(c) + p_n(c)p_1'(c) = \iota(n)c^{\,n-1}c + c^{n} \cdot 1$. Now $c^{\,n-1}c = c^{\,(n-1)+1} = c^{n}$ by [L1], so the right-hand side is $\iota(n)c^{n} + c^{n} = \bigl(\iota(n)+1\bigr)c^{n} = \iota(n+1)c^{n}$ by [L2]. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1, L2, L3]

3.1 **Claim 2.** Steps 1.1 and 2.1 are the base case and the successor step of an induction over the naturals $n \ge 1$, so by [L5] the function $p_n$ is differentiable at every $c \in \mathbb{R}$ with $p_n'(c) = \iota(n)c^{\,n-1}$, for every natural $n \ge 1$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L5]

4.1 **Claim 3.** Let $n \ge 1$. The set $\{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : p_n(x) \ne 0 \,\}$ is exactly $A_0$: a nonzero $x$ has $x^{n} \ne 0$ by [L7], and $0^{n} = 0$ by [L1]. Fix $c \in A_0$. The constant function $1$ on $\mathbb{R}$ is differentiable at $c$ with derivative $0$ by step 1.3, and $p_n$ is differentiable at $c$ with derivative $\iota(n)c^{\,n-1}$ by step 3.1, with $p_n(c) = c^{n} \ne 0$. So the quotient rule of [L3] applies: the function $x \mapsto 1/x^{n}$ on $A_0$, which by [L1] and [L7] is $m_n$, is differentiable at $c$ with derivative $\bigl(0 \cdot c^{n} - 1 \cdot \iota(n)c^{\,n-1}\bigr)/(c^{n})^{2} = -\iota(n)\,c^{\,n-1}\bigl(c^{\,2n}\bigr)^{-1} = -\iota(n)\,c^{\,n-1-2n} = -\iota(n)\,c^{\,-n-1}$, where $(c^{n})^{2} = c^{\,2n}$ and $c^{\,n-1}c^{\,-2n} = c^{\,-n-1}$ are [L7]. [step 1.3, step 3.1, L1, L3, L7]

4.2 **Claim 4, by a second induction on $n$.** Fix $c \in \mathbb{R}$ and the sequence $a$. At $n = 0$ the sum $P(x) = \sum_{j<0} a_j x^{j}$ is $0$ for every $x$ by [L6], so $P$ is the constant function $0$ and, as in step 1.3, $P'(c) = 0 = \sum_{j<0} e_j$. Suppose the claim holds at $n$, and let $P_{n+1}(x) := \sum_{j<n+1} a_j x^{j}$. By [L6], $P_{n+1}(x) = P_n(x) + a_n x^{n}$ for every $x$, where $P_n(x) = \sum_{j<n} a_j x^{j}$. The function $x \mapsto a_n x^{n}$ is differentiable at $c$ with derivative $e_n$: for $n = 0$ it is the constant $a_n$, of derivative $0 = e_0$, by step 1.3 and the scalar rule of [L3]; for $n \ge 1$ it is the scalar multiple $a_n p_n$, of derivative $a_n \iota(n)c^{\,n-1} = e_n$, by step 3.1 and the scalar rule of [L3]. The inductive hypothesis gives $P_n'(c) = \sum_{j<n} e_j$, so the sum rule of [L3] gives that $P_{n+1}$ is differentiable at $c$ with $P_{n+1}'(c) = \sum_{j<n} e_j + e_n = \sum_{j<n+1} e_j$ by [L6]. By [L5] claim 4 holds for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 1.3, step 3.1, L3, L5, L6]

5.1 All four claims are established: claim 1 by step 1.3, claim 2 by step 3.1, claim 3 by step 4.1 and claim 4 by step 4.2. [step 1.3, step 3.1, step 4.1, step 4.2, discharge-induction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the induction starts at $n = 1$ and not at $n = 0$.** The successor step multiplies by the identity, and the identity is $p_1$; starting at $n = 0$ would require the formula of claim 2 to hold at $n = 0$, which it does not, since $c^{-1}$ is undefined at $c = 0$. The two statements are therefore kept apart, and claim 1 is proved on its own from the definition. This is the same index care that [[def-canonical-natural]] records for families of reciprocals: $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$, and a formula written for "$n$" is a claim about $n = 0$ unless it says otherwise.

- **The negative exponents cost nothing extra.** Claim 3 is the quotient rule of [[thm-algebra-of-derivatives]] applied with numerator the constant $1$, and the domain it produces, the set where $x^{n}$ does not vanish, is exactly $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$; no separate argument and no separate limit is needed. Rational exponents are a different matter, resting on [[thm-nth-roots-exist]], and are treated on the companion page rather than here.

- **Claim 4 is a statement about a finite sum, not about an infinite one.** Nothing here says anything about differentiating a series term by term; that is a separate question, needing hypotheses about convergence that this page does not have and does not assume.

## Statement

Let $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be sequences of reals, let
$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, and let $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, with finite sums and
finite products as in [[def-finite-sum]]. Then:

1. **Additivity.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k$.
2. **Scaling.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k$; in particular $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda = n\lambda$, where $n$ denotes the canonical natural $\iota(n) \in \mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).
3. **Splitting.** If $m \le n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k$, and $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n} a_k = \Big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k\Big)$.
4. **Monotonicity.** If $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$. In particular, if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, every single term satisfies $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$ for $j < n$, and $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ forces $a_k = 0$ for every $k < n$.
5. **Telescoping.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}\big(c_{k+1} - c_k\big) = c_n - c_0$.
6. **Products.** $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k) = \Big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\Big)$; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, and if $a_k > 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k > 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\lambda$, and naturals $m, n$. Write $\Sigma_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\Pi_n = \prod_{k<n} a_k$.

[L1] Recursion clauses ([[def-finite-sum]]): $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ and $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n$; $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1$ and $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) \cdot a_n$; and $\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k = \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j}$ for $m \le n$, likewise for products.

[L2] Field axioms: addition and multiplication are associative and commutative, $0$ and $1$ are the identities, $x - x = 0$, and multiplication distributes over addition ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]); and $0 \cdot x = 0$, which is not an axiom but a lemma ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

[L3] Induction principle: a property holding at $0$ and inherited by successors holds at every natural ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L4] Adding inequalities: $x \le y$ and $u \le v$ imply $x + u \le y + v$. [[lem-of-add-order]] states the STRICT forms and only those ($x < y \Rightarrow x + c < y + c$, and $x < y$ with $u < v$ giving $x + u < y + v$); the nonstrict form used throughout below is those two together with the cases $x = y$ and $u = v$, which are settled by trichotomy, the order being total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] The canonical embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a field homomorphism, so $\iota(0) = 0$ and $\iota(n+1) = \iota(n) + 1$, and $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L6] Sign rules: a product of two positives is positive ([[lem-of-sign-rules]], claim 1), and a product of two nonnegatives is nonnegative, since a factor equal to $0$ makes the product $0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]) and otherwise both factors are positive; and $1 > 0$, which is proved in [[cor-of-one-positive]] and stated by none of the items named above.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 0$: every claim holds at $n = 0$, since both sides of claim 1 are $0 = 0 + 0$, both sides of claim 2 are $0 = \lambda \cdot 0$ and $0 = \iota(0)\lambda$, claim 4 reads $0 \le 0$ with no term to bound and the hypothesis $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ giving nothing to prove, claim 5 reads $0 = c_0 - c_0$, and claim 6 reads $1 = 1 \cdot 1$ with $1 > 0$. [base, L1, L2, L5, L6]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for this $n$ and for all sequences $a, b, c$ and all $\lambda$. [ih]

1.3 Splitting, claim 3, by a separate induction on the number of trailing terms $d = n - m$ with $m$ fixed: for $d = 0$ the claim reads $\sum_{k<m} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + 0$ and $\prod_{k<m} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\big) \cdot 1$, which hold; and if $\sum_{k<m+d} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d} a_{m+j}$, then $\sum_{k<m+d+1} a_k = \sum_{k<m+d} a_k + a_{m+d} = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \big(\sum_{j<d} a_{m+j} + a_{m+d}\big) = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d+1} a_{m+j}$ by associativity, and identically for products with $1$ in place of $0$ and multiplication in place of addition, so induction on $d$ gives claim 3 for every $m \le n$. [L1, L2, L3]

2.1 Additivity at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k\big) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) + \big(\sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n\big) = \sum_{k<n+1} a_k + \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$, using the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of addition. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Scaling at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda a_k = \sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda\big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) = \lambda \sum_{k<n+1} a_k$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and distributivity; taking $a_k = 1$ for all $k$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda = \sum_{k<n} \lambda + \lambda = \iota(n)\lambda + \lambda = (\iota(n) + 1)\lambda = \iota(n+1)\lambda$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L5]

2.3 Monotonicity at $n+1$: assume $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n+1$; then $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$, so the hypothesis gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$, and adding the inequality $a_n \le b_n$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n \le \sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n = \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$. [step 1.2, L1, L4]

2.4 Telescoping at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(c_{k+1} - c_k) = \sum_{k<n}(c_{k+1} - c_k) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = (c_n - c_0) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = c_{n+1} - c_0$, by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and the field identities. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.5 Products at $n+1$: $\prod_{k<n+1}(a_k b_k) = \big(\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k)\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n+1} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n+1} b_k\big)$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of multiplication; and if every $a_k \ge 0$ for $k < n+1$ then $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) a_n$ is a product of two nonnegatives, hence nonnegative, with the same argument giving positivity from positivity since $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1 > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L6]

3.1 Consequences of monotonicity, completing claim 4: monotonicity itself holds at every $n$, by the induction principle applied to the base case of step 1.1 and the successor step 2.3, so it is available for an arbitrary $n$ in what follows; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then comparing with the zero sequence gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge \sum_{k<n} 0 = 0$; for $j < n$ splitting at $j$ and then at $j+1$ writes $\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<j} a_k + a_j + \sum_{k=j+1}^{n-1} a_k$ with the first and third summands $\ge 0$, so $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$; and if moreover $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ then $0 \le a_j \le 0$ for every $j < n$, so $a_j = 0$. [step 1.1, step 2.3, step 1.3, L3, L4, L2]

4.1 By the induction principle claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and claim 3 was proved in step 1.3 with its consequences in step 3.1, so all six laws hold. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, step 2.5, step 1.3, step 3.1, L3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field, with field structure as in [[def-field]], and for
$n \ge 1$ let $n \cdot 1_F$ denote the canonical natural number
$\underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$, defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$
and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$. Then for every $n \ge 1$:

- $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$;
- the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$;
- $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ and $(mn) \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F)$ for all $m, n \ge 1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ whose canonical naturals are defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, with $0 \cdot 1_F = 0$.

[L1] $0 < 1_F$ in every ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] The order is compatible with addition and positives are closed under addition: $a < b$ implies $a + c < b + c$, and $a > 0$, $b > 0$ imply $a + b > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 1$: by definition $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, and $1_F > 0$. [L1, base]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: assume $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for some fixed $n \ge 1$. [ih]

1.3 By the recursion, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F - n \cdot 1_F = 1_F > 0$, so $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$. [given, L1]

1.4 Additive identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ by the recursion, and if $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ then $(m+n+1) \cdot 1_F = (m+n) \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + (n+1) \cdot 1_F$. [given, algebra]

2.1 Inductive step: $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ is a sum of two positives, by the hypothesis and $1_F > 0$, hence $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Iterating 1.3, for $m < n$ one has $m \cdot 1_F < n \cdot 1_F$, so $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing and therefore injective on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$. [step 1.3, L2]

2.3 Multiplicative identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m \cdot 1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(1 \cdot 1_F)$, and the step $(m(n+1)) \cdot 1_F = (mn + m) \cdot 1_F = (mn) \cdot 1_F + m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F) + (m \cdot 1_F)(1_F) = (m \cdot 1_F)((n+1) \cdot 1_F)$ uses 1.4 and distributivity. [step 1.4, algebra]

3.1 By induction on 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for every $n \ge 1$; with the strict increase 2.2 and the identities 1.4, 2.3, every claim holds. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 1.4, step 2.3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $c \in A$ be a limit point of $A$
([[def-limit-point-r]]), let $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ be differentiable at $c$
([[def-derivative]]) and let $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$. Then:

1. $f + g$ is differentiable at $c$ and $(f+g)'(c) = f'(c) + g'(c)$;
2. $\alpha f$ is differentiable at $c$ and $(\alpha f)'(c) = \alpha f'(c)$;
3. $fg$ is differentiable at $c$ and $(fg)'(c) = f'(c)g(c) + f(c)g'(c)$;
4. if $g(c) \ne 0$ then, writing $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$, the
   point $c$ lies in $A_0$ and is a limit point of $A_0$, the quotient
   $(f/g)|_{A_0} : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$, $x \mapsto f(x)/g(x)$, is differentiable
   at $c$ as a function on $A_0$, and
   $$\bigl((f/g)|_{A_0}\bigr)'(c) \;=\; \frac{f'(c)\,g(c) - f(c)\,g'(c)}{g(c)^{2}} .$$

Each claim asserts two things: that the derivative on the left exists, and that
it has the stated value. Both are proved.

**Why claim 4 is stated on $A_0$.** The function $f/g$ is not defined where $g$
vanishes, and $g$ may vanish at points of $A$ far from $c$; restricting to $A_0$
is forced. That the restriction still has $c$ as a limit point, so that a
derivative there means anything at all, is not free either, and it is the last
claim of [[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]] applied to $g$. The hypothesis
is $g(c) \ne 0$, not "$g$ vanishes nowhere".

**Everything is proved through
[[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]].** No difference quotient is estimated and
no limit theorem beyond continuity is used, so no choice principle is spent.
The four identities are four algebraic rearrangements of an increment, each
followed by a reading of [[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a point $c \in A$ that is a limit point of $A$, functions $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ differentiable at $c$, and a real $\alpha$; for claim 4 also the hypothesis $g(c) \ne 0$ together with $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$ ([[def-derivative]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L1] Carathéodory's characterisation ([[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]]), used in both directions: for a set $B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a point $p \in B$ that is a limit point of $B$ and a function $h : B \to \mathbb{R}$, the function $h$ is differentiable at $p$ if and only if there is $\eta : B \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $p$, with $h(x) - h(p) = \eta(x)(x - p)$ for every $x \in B$, and then $\eta(p) = h'(p)$.

[L2] Algebra of continuous functions ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]]): sums, scalar multiples and products of functions continuous at a point are continuous there (claim 1); every constant function and the identity are continuous everywhere on the domain (claim 5); and if $u, v$ are continuous at a point $p$ of their common domain $D$ with $v(p) \ne 0$, then $p$ lies in $D_0 := \{x \in D : v(x) \ne 0\}$ and $(u/v)|_{D_0}$ is continuous at $p$ as a function on $D_0$ (claim 4).

[L3] Continuity passes to a subset of the domain: if $B \subseteq A$, if $p \in B$ and if $\psi : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $p$, then $\psi|_B$ is continuous at $p$, the condition on the restriction quantifying over fewer points ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L4] A function differentiable at $c$ is continuous at $c$ ([[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]]); in particular $g$ is.

[L5] At a limit point $c$ of $A$, continuity of $g$ at $c$ says exactly that $\lim_{x \to c} g(x)$ exists and equals $g(c)$ ([[def-continuity-real]], clause 1, [[def-function-limit]]).

[L6] Sign preservation ([[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]]): if $c$ is a limit point of $A$ and $\lim_{x \to c} g(x)$ exists and is nonzero, then $c$ is a limit point of $A_0 = \{x \in A : g(x) \ne 0\}$.

[L7] A product of two nonzero reals is nonzero ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]), and $g(c)^{2} = g(c)\,g(c)$ ([[def-integer-power]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L1], applied to $f$ and to $g$ on $A$ at $c$, fix $\varphi, \psi : A \to \mathbb{R}$, both continuous at $c$, with $f(x) - f(c) = \varphi(x)(x - c)$ and $g(x) - g(c) = \psi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in A$, and with $\varphi(c) = f'(c)$ and $\psi(c) = g'(c)$. [L1, choose]

1.2 Assume $g(c) \ne 0$. Then $c \in A_0$ by the definition of $A_0$; $g$ is continuous at $c$ by [L4], so $\lim_{x \to c} g(x) = g(c) \ne 0$ by [L5]; and therefore $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$ by [L6]. [L4, L5, L6]

2.1 **Sum.** For every $x \in A$, $(f+g)(x) - (f+g)(c) = \bigl(f(x)-f(c)\bigr) + \bigl(g(x)-g(c)\bigr) = \bigl(\varphi(x) + \psi(x)\bigr)(x-c)$. The function $\varphi + \psi$ is continuous at $c$ by [L2], and $(\varphi+\psi)(c) = f'(c) + g'(c)$. So [L1] gives claim 1. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.2 **Scalar multiple.** For every $x \in A$, $(\alpha f)(x) - (\alpha f)(c) = \alpha\bigl(f(x)-f(c)\bigr) = \bigl(\alpha\varphi(x)\bigr)(x-c)$. The function $\alpha\varphi$ is continuous at $c$ by [L2], with value $\alpha f'(c)$ there. So [L1] gives claim 2. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.3 **Product.** For every $x \in A$, $f(x)g(x) - f(c)g(c) = \bigl(f(x)-f(c)\bigr)g(x) + f(c)\bigl(g(x)-g(c)\bigr) = \bigl(\varphi(x)g(x) + f(c)\psi(x)\bigr)(x-c)$. Put $\chi := \varphi\,g + f(c)\,\psi$; it is continuous at $c$ by [L2], since $\varphi$, $\psi$ and (by [L4]) $g$ are, and constants are; and $\chi(c) = \varphi(c)g(c) + f(c)\psi(c) = f'(c)g(c) + f(c)g'(c)$. So [L1] gives claim 3. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L4]

2.4 **Quotient, the rearrangement.** Assume $g(c) \ne 0$ and let $x \in A_0$, so $g(x) \ne 0$ and $g(c) \ne 0$. Then $f(x)/g(x) - f(c)/g(c) = \bigl(f(x)g(c) - f(c)g(x)\bigr)/\bigl(g(x)g(c)\bigr)$, and $f(x)g(c) - f(c)g(x) = \bigl(f(x)-f(c)\bigr)g(c) - f(c)\bigl(g(x)-g(c)\bigr) = \bigl(\varphi(x)g(c) - f(c)\psi(x)\bigr)(x-c)$. So, defining $\theta : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$ by $\theta(x) := \bigl(\varphi(x)g(c) - f(c)\psi(x)\bigr)/\bigl(g(x)g(c)\bigr)$, one has $(f/g)|_{A_0}(x) - (f/g)|_{A_0}(c) = \theta(x)(x-c)$ for every $x \in A_0$. [step 1.1, L1, L7]

2.5 **Quotient, continuity of the factor.** Assume $g(c) \ne 0$. The restrictions of $\varphi$, $\psi$ and $g$ to $A_0$ are continuous at $c \in A_0$ by [L3] and [L4], so by [L2] the numerator $u(x) := \varphi(x)g(c) - f(c)\psi(x)$ and the denominator $v(x) := g(x)g(c)$ are continuous at $c$ as functions on $A_0$. By [L7] the denominator vanishes at no point of $A_0$, so $\{x \in A_0 : v(x) \ne 0\} = A_0$, and $v(c) = g(c)^{2} \ne 0$; hence claim 4 of [L2] gives that $\theta = (u/v)|_{A_0}$ is continuous at $c$, with $\theta(c) = \bigl(\varphi(c)g(c) - f(c)\psi(c)\bigr)/g(c)^{2} = \bigl(f'(c)g(c) - f(c)g'(c)\bigr)/g(c)^{2}$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L2, L3, L4, L7]

3.1 **Quotient, conclusion.** Assume $g(c) \ne 0$. By step 1.2 the point $c$ lies in $A_0$ and is a limit point of $A_0$; by steps 2.4 and 2.5 the function $\theta : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$ and factors the increment of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$. So [L1], applied on the domain $A_0$ at the point $c$, gives that $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ is differentiable at $c$ with derivative $\theta(c)$: claim 4. [step 1.2, step 2.4, step 2.5, L1]

4.1 Claims 1 to 4 are proved, by steps 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 3.1 respectively, each by exhibiting the Carathéodory factor of the new function and reading its continuity at $c$ off the algebra of continuous functions. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The product rearrangement in one line.** The identity $fg - f(c)g(c) = (f - f(c))\,g + f(c)\,(g - g(c))$ splits the increment of a product into two increments, one multiplied by $g$ and one by a constant. It is the same identity that carries the product case of [[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]], read at the level of increments rather than of $\varepsilon$; here the factor $g$ has to be continuous at $c$ rather than merely bounded near it, and [[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]] is what supplies that.

- **The reciprocal is the case $f \equiv 1$.** Claim 4 then reads $\bigl((1/g)|_{A_0}\bigr)'(c) = -g'(c)/g(c)^{2}$, since $f'(c) = 0$ for a constant $f$; nothing separate has to be proved, and the derivative of a negative integer power on this page is obtained exactly this way.

- **Two hypotheses that look removable and are not.** In claim 4 the hypothesis $g(c) \ne 0$ cannot be weakened to "$g$ is nonzero somewhere near $c$", because $c$ itself must lie in the smaller domain for a derivative there to be a statement about $c$; and the conclusion is about $(f/g)|_{A_0}$, not about any extension of it to $A$, since no such extension is canonical.

## Statement

Let $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ with
$g[A] \subseteq B$ and let $f : B \to \mathbb{R}$, so that the composite
$f \circ g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is defined. Let $c \in A$ be a limit point of
$A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]) at which $g$ is differentiable
([[def-derivative]]), put $b := g(c)$, and suppose $b$ is a limit point of $B$
at which $f$ is differentiable. Then $f \circ g$ is differentiable at $c$ and

$$(f \circ g)'(c) \;=\; f'\bigl(g(c)\bigr)\,g'(c) .$$

**Both limit-point hypotheses are needed, and neither is automatic.** That $c$
is a limit point of $A$ is what makes $g'(c)$ and $(f \circ g)'(c)$ defined
symbols; that $b = g(c)$ is a limit point of $B$ is what makes $f'(b)$ one.
Nothing forces the second: $g$ may be differentiable at $c$ and send $c$ to an
isolated point of $B$, and there $f'(b)$ is not defined and the formula asserts
nothing.

**No case analysis appears anywhere.** The naive difference-quotient proof
writes $\frac{f(g(x)) - f(g(c))}{g(x) - g(c)} \cdot \frac{g(x) - g(c)}{x - c}$
and then has to say what happens where $g(x) = g(c)$, which may occur at points
arbitrarily close to $c$. Carathéodory's factorisation never divides by the
inner increment, so the difficulty does not arise.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sets $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, functions $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ with $g[A] \subseteq B$ and $f : B \to \mathbb{R}$, a point $c \in A$ that is a limit point of $A$ at which $g$ is differentiable, and the point $b := g(c) \in B$, a limit point of $B$ at which $f$ is differentiable ([[def-derivative]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L1] Carathéodory's characterisation ([[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]]), used in both directions: for $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a point $p \in D$ that is a limit point of $D$ and $h : D \to \mathbb{R}$, the function $h$ is differentiable at $p$ if and only if there is $\eta : D \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $p$, with $h(y) - h(p) = \eta(y)(y - p)$ for every $y \in D$, and then $\eta(p) = h'(p)$.

[L2] Algebra of continuous functions ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], claim 1): a product of two functions continuous at a point of their common domain is continuous there.

[L3] Composition of continuous functions ([[thm-composition-of-continuous-functions]]): if $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ has $g[A] \subseteq B$ and is continuous at $c \in A$, and if $\eta : B \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $g(c)$, then $\eta \circ g$ is continuous at $c$ ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L4] A function differentiable at a point is continuous there ([[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L1], applied to $g$ on $A$ at $c$, fix $\psi : A \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $c$, with $g(x) - g(c) = \psi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in A$ and $\psi(c) = g'(c)$. [L1, choose]

1.2 By [L1], applied to $f$ on $B$ at $b$, fix $\varphi : B \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $b$, with $f(y) - f(b) = \varphi(y)(y - b)$ for every $y \in B$ and $\varphi(b) = f'(b)$. [L1, choose]

2.1 **The factorisation.** Let $x \in A$. Then $g(x) \in B$, so taking $y := g(x)$ in step 1.2 gives $f(g(x)) - f(b) = \varphi(g(x))\bigl(g(x) - b\bigr)$, and $g(x) - b = g(x) - g(c) = \psi(x)(x-c)$ by step 1.1. Since $(f \circ g)(c) = f(g(c)) = f(b)$, this reads $(f \circ g)(x) - (f \circ g)(c) = \chi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in A$, where $\chi : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is the pointwise product $\chi := (\varphi \circ g)\,\psi$. [step 1.1, step 1.2]

2.2 **The outer factor is continuous at $c$.** By [L4] the function $g$ is continuous at $c$; by step 1.2 the function $\varphi$ is continuous at $b = g(c)$; and $g[A] \subseteq B$. So $\varphi \circ g$ is continuous at $c$ by [L3]. [step 1.2, L3, L4]

3.1 **The factor is continuous at $c$, with the right value.** $\chi$ is the product of $\varphi \circ g$, continuous at $c$ by step 2.2, with $\psi$, continuous at $c$ by step 1.1, so $\chi$ is continuous at $c$ by [L2]; and $\chi(c) = \varphi(g(c))\,\psi(c) = \varphi(b)\,\psi(c) = f'(b)\,g'(c)$. [step 1.1, step 2.2, L2]

4.1 By step 2.1 the function $\chi : A \to \mathbb{R}$ factors the increment of $f \circ g$ at $c$, and by step 3.1 it is continuous at $c$. So [L1], applied to $f \circ g$ on $A$ at the limit point $c$, gives that $f \circ g$ is differentiable at $c$ with $(f \circ g)'(c) = \chi(c) = f'(g(c))\,g'(c)$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the classical proof goes wrong, precisely.** It divides by $g(x) - g(c)$, which may vanish at points arbitrarily close to $c$ even when $g$ is differentiable at $c$ with $g'(c) = 0$; the usual repair defines an auxiliary function equal to the outer quotient off the bad set and to $f'(b)$ on it, and then proves that auxiliary function continuous. That auxiliary function is $\varphi \circ g$, and [[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]] is the observation that it exists before any repair is attempted.

- **What is composed is continuity, not differentiability.** The only theorem about composites used above is [[thm-composition-of-continuous-functions]], and it needs no side hypothesis, unlike the corresponding statement for limits. That is the whole reason the proof has no cases.

- **The formula is about the point $g(c)$, not about $g$ near $c$.** Both derivatives on the right are taken at single points, and the theorem says nothing about $f$ on the image of any neighbourhood of $c$. In particular no hypothesis is placed on $g[A]$ beyond its lying in $B$.

## Statement

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. If $0 \in S$ and $\sigma(n) \in S$ whenever $n \in S$, then $S = \mathbb{N}$. Equivalently (property form): if a property $P$ satisfies $P(0)$ and ($P(n) \Rightarrow P(\sigma(n))$) for all $n$, then $P(n)$ holds for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. This is the induction principle, the basis of proof by induction.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $\mathbb{N} = \omega$ is the smallest inductive set ([[def-inductive-set]], [[def-natural-numbers]], [[lem-omega-smallest-inductive]]); $0 = \varnothing$, $\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$.

[L1] $\omega$ is contained in every inductive set ([[lem-omega-smallest-inductive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Suppose $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ with $0 = \varnothing \in S$ and ($x \in S \Rightarrow \sigma(x) = x \cup \{x\} \in S$). [given]

2.1 Then $S$ contains $\varnothing$ and is closed under $x \mapsto x \cup \{x\}$, so $S$ is an inductive set. [step 1.1]

3.1 $\mathbb{N} = \omega \subseteq S$ because $\omega$ is a subset of every inductive set. [L1, step 2.1]

4.1 With $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ by hypothesis, $S = \mathbb{N}$. [step 3.1, given]

5.1 The property form is the set case with $S = \{n \in \mathbb{N} : P(n)\}$: $P(0)$ and $P(n) \Rightarrow P(\sigma(n))$ give $0 \in S$ and $\sigma$-closure, so $S = \mathbb{N}$, i.e. $P$ holds for all $n$; conversely the set form is the property form applied to $P(n) :\equiv n \in S$, so the two are equivalent. [step 4.1] ∎
