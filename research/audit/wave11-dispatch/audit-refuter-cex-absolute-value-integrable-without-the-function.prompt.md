## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` Statement or counterexample, actively search for a
counterexample to the public claim or a failure in the witness. A false public
claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or materially
inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is nonfatal.

## Statement refuted

**False claim:** if $|f|$ is Riemann integrable on $[a,b]$ then so is $f$; that
is, the first clause of
[[cor-integrability-of-absolute-values-products-and-lattice-operations]] has a
converse.

Let $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ be the Dirichlet function
([[def-dirichlet-and-thomae-functions]]) and put

$$f : [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad f(x) \;:=\; 2\,\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(x) - 1 \;=\; \begin{cases} 1 & x \text{ rational}, \\ -1 & x \text{ irrational}. \end{cases}$$

Then $|f|$ is the constant function $1$, integrable with $\int_0^1 |f| = 1$,
while $f$ is **not** Riemann integrable on $[0,1]$: every lower Darboux sum of
$f$ is $-1$ and every upper Darboux sum is $1$, so the lower and upper integrals
are $-1$ and $1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The function $f = 2\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}} - 1$ on $[0,1]$, and a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[0,1]$.

[L1] $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(x) = 1$ at a rational $x$ and $0$ at an irrational $x$ ([[def-dirichlet-and-thomae-functions]]).

[L2] Both $\mathbb{Q}$ and the irrationals are dense in $\mathbb{R}$, so every nonempty open interval contains a rational and an irrational ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]).

[L3] For a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[0,1]$: $n \ge 1$, $\Delta_i = t_{i+1}-t_i > 0$, $\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = 1$, and the open interval $(t_i,t_{i+1})$ is nonempty ([[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-interval]], [[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L4] $L(u,P) = \sum_{i<n}m_i\Delta_i$ and $U(u,P) = \sum_{i<n}M_i\Delta_i$ with $m_i = \inf u[I_i]$ and $M_i = \sup u[I_i]$; a set with a least element has it as its infimum and with a greatest element has it as its supremum ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-infimum]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L5] $\underline{\int_0^1} u = \sup_P L(u,P)$ and $\overline{\int_0^1} u = \inf_P U(u,P)$; $u$ is integrable exactly when the two agree ([[def-darboux-integral]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L6] Finite sums: scaling and $\sum_{i<n}\lambda\Delta_i = \lambda\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], clause 2).

[L7] $\int_p^q c = c(q-p)$ for a constant $c$ ([[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]]).

[L8] Absolute value and ordered-field arithmetic: $|1| = |-1| = 1$, and the order is total ([[def-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $|f|$ is the constant function $1$ on $[0,1]$: at a rational $x$, $f(x) = 2\cdot1 - 1 = 1$, and at an irrational $x$, $f(x) = 2\cdot0-1 = -1$, and $|1| = |-1| = 1$ by [L1] and [L8]. Hence $|f|$ is integrable with $\int_0^1|f| = 1$ by [L7]. [given, L1, L7, L8]

1.2 Let $P = (n,t)$ be any partition of $[0,1]$ and let $i < n$. The open interval $(t_i,t_{i+1})$ is nonempty by [L3], so it contains a rational and an irrational by [L2]; both lie in $I_i$, so $1 \in f[I_i]$ and $-1 \in f[I_i]$. [given, L2, L3]

2.1 $f$ is bounded, with values in $\{-1,1\}$, so its Darboux sums are defined by [L4] and [L5]. [step 1.1, given, L4, L5]

3.1 Since $f[I_i] \subseteq \{-1,1\}$ and both values occur, $m_i = -1$ and $M_i = 1$ by [L4]. [step 2.1, step 1.2, L4]

4.1 Hence $L(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}(-1)\Delta_i = -1$ and $U(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}1\cdot\Delta_i = 1$, by [L4], [L6] and [L3]. [step 3.1, L3, L4, L6]

5.1 That holds for every partition $P$, so the set of lower sums is $\{-1\}$ and the set of upper sums is $\{1\}$; by [L5], $\underline{\int_0^1}f = -1 \ne 1 = \overline{\int_0^1}f$ and $f$ is not integrable. [step 4.1, L5]

6.1 So $|f|$ is integrable on $[0,1]$ while $f$ is not, and the claim is false. [step 1.1, step 5.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The Lebesgue criterion says the same thing.** $f$ agrees with $2\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}} - 1$, and $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ is continuous at no point of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-dirichlet-and-thomae-continuity-sets]], claim 1), so the discontinuity set of $f$ in $[0,1]$ is the whole of $[0,1]$, which is not null ([[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]]); by [[thm-lebesgue-criterion]] $f$ is not integrable. The direct computation above is given because it also *locates* both Darboux integrals, which the criterion does not.

- **Why no converse can be expected.** Passing to $|f|$ destroys all sign information, and integrability is a statement about the oscillation of $f$; here $|f|$ has oscillation $0$ on every subinterval while $f$ has oscillation $2$ on every subinterval. The corollary's implication runs only in the direction the composition theorem provides, because $t \mapsto |t|$ is continuous and no continuous $\psi$ satisfies $\psi(|t|) = t$.

- **The same example separates $\int|f|$ from $\bigl|\int f\bigr|$ in the strongest possible way**: the right-hand side is not even defined.

For $i = 0$ both equal $a$. Suppose $t_j = t'_j$\nfor all $j \\le i$ and $i + 1 \\le \\min\\{n,n'\\}$. The set\n$S := \\{\\, x \\in \\operatorname{pts}(P) : x > t_i \\,\\}$ has $t_{i+1}$ as its least\nelement: $t_{i+1} \\in S$, and any $x \\in S$ is $t_j$ for some $j \\le n$ with\n$t_j > t_i$, which forces $j > i$ because $t$ is increasing on indices $\\le n$,\nhence $j \\ge i+1$ and $x = t_j \\ge t_{i+1}$. The same argument in $P'$ makes\n$t'_{i+1}$ the least element of\n$\\{\\, x \\in \\operatorname{pts}(P') : x > t'_i \\,\\}$, which is the same set $S$,\nsince the point sets agree and $t'_i = t_i$. A set has at most one least element\n([[def-max-min]]), so $t_{i+1} = t'_{i+1}$.\n\nSecond, $n = n'$. If $n < n'$ then $t'_n = t_n = b$ by the previous paragraph,\nwhile $t'_n < t'_{n'} = b$ because $t'$ is increasing on indices $\\le n'$ and\n$n < n'$; that is impossible. Exchanging the roles of $P$ and $P'$ rules out\n$n' < n$. $\\square$\n\nSo the map $P \\mapsto \\operatorname{pts}(P)$ is injective, and a partition may be\nnamed by its point set whenever one is exhibited.\n\n### Inserting a point\n\nLet $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ and let $c \\in [a,b]$. Define a\npartition $P + c$ of $[a,b]$ as follows.\n\n- If $c \\in \\operatorname{pts}(P)$, put $P + c := P$.\n- Otherwise $c \\ne a$ and $c \\ne b$, so $a < c < b$. The set\n  $T := \\{\\, t_i : i \\le n \\text{ and } t_i < c \\,\\}$ is a nonempty finite set of\n  reals, nonempty because $t_0 = a < c$, so it has a maximum\n  ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]); let $i_0 \\le n$ be the unique index with\n  $t_{i_0} = \\max T$, unique because $t$ is injective on indices $\\le n$. Then\n  $i_0 < n$, since $t_n = b > c$ puts $t_n \\notin T$; and\n  $$t_{i_0} \\;<\\; c \\;<\\; t_{i_0+1},$$\n  the right inequality because $t_{i_0+1} \\ne c$ (as $c \\notin \\operatorname{pts}(P)$)\n  and $t_{i_0+1} < c$ would put $t_{i_0+1} \\in T$ with $t_{i_0+1} > t_{i_0} = \\max T$.\n  Put $P + c := (n+1, s)$ with\n  $$s_i := t_i \\ (i \\le i_0), \\qquad s_{i_0+1} := c, \\qquad s_i := t_{i-1} \\ (i_0 + 2 \\le i \\le n+1), \\qquad s_k := b \\ (k \\ge n+1).$$\n\nIn both cases $P + c$ is a partition of $[a,b]$ and\n\n$$\\operatorname{pts}(P + c) \\;=\\; \\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\{c\\}, \\qquad \\|P+c\\| \\;\\le\\; \\|P\\| .$$\n\nThe displayed identity is immediate from the two cases. For the mesh: in the\nfirst case nothing changes; in the second the list of subinterval lengths of\n$P + c$ is that of $P$ with $\\Delta_{i_0}$ replaced by the two numbers\n$c - t_{i_0}$ and $t_{i_0+1} - c$, each of which is smaller than\n$\\Delta_{i_0} = (c - t_{i_0}) + (t_{i_0+1} - c)$ because the other is positive.\nSo every length of $P + c$ is at most a length of $P$, and the maximum cannot\nincrease. Finally the index count grows by exactly $1$ in the second case and\nnot at all in the first.\n\n### Refinement and the common refinement\n\n$P'$ **refines** $P$, and is a **refinement** of $P$, when\n\n$$\\operatorname{pts}(P) \\;\\subseteq\\; \\operatorname{pts}(P') .$$\n\nLet $P = (n,t)$ and $Q = (m,s)$ be partitions of $[a,b]$. Applying the recursion\ntheorem ([[thm-recursion]]) to the set $\\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$,\nwhere $\\mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$ is the set of partitions of $[a,b]$, with starting\nelement $(0, P)$ and the map $(j, R) \\mapsto (j+1,\\ R + s_j)$ — legitimate\nbecause $s_j \\in [a,b]$ for every $j \\in \\mathbb{N}$ — gives a unique family\n$(R_j)_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ of partitions with $R_0 = P$ and $R_{j+1} = R_j + s_j$.\nThe **common refinement** of $P$ and $Q$ is\n\n$$P \\vee Q \\;:=\\; R_{m+1} .$$\n\n**Its point set is the union.** By induction on $j$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]),\n$\\operatorname{pts}(R_j) = \\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\{\\, s_l : l < j \\,\\}$;\ntaking $j = m+1$ gives\n\n$$\\operatorname{pts}(P \\vee Q) \\;=\\; \\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\operatorname{pts}(Q).$$\n\nHence $P \\vee Q$ refines both $P$ and $Q$; by the uniqueness claim above it is\nthe **only** partition with that point set, so $P \\vee Q = Q \\vee P$, and\n\n$$P' \\text{ refines } P \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad P \\vee P' = P' ,$$\n\nsince then $\\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\operatorname{pts}(P') =\n\\operatorname{pts}(P')$.\n\n**Two size bounds, both used later.** Writing $n_R$ for the first component of a\npartition $R$:\n\n$$\\|P \\vee Q\\| \\;\\le\\; \\|P\\|, \\qquad n_{P \\vee Q} \\;\\le\\; n_P + n_Q - 1 .$$\n\nThe first is the mesh bound above applied $m+1$ times. For the second, each\ninsertion raises the index count by at most $1$, and the two insertions of\n$s_0 = a$ and $s_m = b$ raise it by $0$, since $a$ and $b$ already lie in\n$\\operatorname{pts}(P)$ and hence in $\\operatorname{pts}(R_j)$ for every $j$; so\nat most $m - 1$ of the $m+1$ insertions increase it.\n\n### The index map of a refinement\n\nLet $P' = (n',t')$ refine $P = (n,t)$. For each $i \\le n$ the point $t_i$ lies in\n$\\operatorname{pts}(P')$, so there is exactly one $\\varphi(i) \\le n'$ with\n$t'_{\\varphi(i)} = t_i$, uniqueness because $t'$ is injective on indices $\\le n'$.\nThe resulting map $\\varphi$ satisfies\n\n$$\\varphi(0) = 0, \\qquad \\varphi(n) = n', \\qquad \\varphi(i) < \\varphi(i+1) \\ \\ (i < n),$$\n\nthe first two because $t'_0 = a = t_0$ and $t'_{n'} = b = t_n$ together with\ninjectivity, and the third because $t_i < t_{i+1}$ and $t'$ is increasing on\nindices $\\le n'$. In particular $n \\le n'$. Moreover, for $i < n$ and\n$\\varphi(i) \\le j < \\varphi(i+1)$,\n\n$$I'_j \\;=\\; [\\,t'_j,\\ t'_{j+1}\\,] \\;\\subseteq\\; [\\,t_i,\\ t_{i+1}\\,] \\;=\\; I_i ,$$\n\nbecause $t_i = t'_{\\varphi(i)} \\le t'_j$ and $t'_{j+1} \\le t'_{\\varphi(i+1)} = t_{i+1}$.\n\n**The blocks are counted by telescoping.** By clause 5 of\n[[lem-finite-sum-laws]],\n$\\sum_{i<n}\\big(\\varphi(i+1) - \\varphi(i)\\big) = \\varphi(n) - \\varphi(0) = n'$,\nso, subtracting $\\sum_{i<n} 1 = n$,\n\n$$\\sum_{i<n} \\big(\\varphi(i+1) - \\varphi(i) - 1\\big) \\;=\\; n' - n ,$$\n\na sum of $n$ nonnegative integers, one for each block, which vanishes exactly at\nthe blocks consisting of a single index.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]). Then:

1. $|f|$, $f^{2}$ and $fg$ are integrable on $[a,b]$
   ([[def-abs-value]], [[def-integer-power]]);
2. $\max(f,g)$ and $\min(f,g)$, defined pointwise
   ([[def-max-min]]), are integrable on $[a,b]$;
3. the **triangle inequality for the integral**:
   $$\Bigl|\int_a^b f\Bigr| \;\le\; \int_a^b |f| .$$

**Claim 3 is stated with $a < b$ and is not orientation-invariant.** For $u > v$
the right-hand side is $-\int_v^u |f| \le 0$ while the left-hand side is $\ge 0$,
so the inequality as written is false there. The form valid for *every* pair
$u,v$ on which $f$ is integrable ([[def-oriented-integral]]) is

$$\Bigl|\int_u^v f\Bigr| \;\le\; \Bigl|\int_u^v |f|\,\Bigr| ,$$

and that is the form the estimates below on this page use whenever the limits
are not known to be in increasing order.

**The converse of claim 1 fails.** Integrability of $|f|$ does not give
integrability of $f$; the witness is on the companion page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and integrable $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] If $u$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ with values in $[m,M]$ and $\varphi$ is continuous on $[m,M]$, then $\varphi\circ u$ is integrable ([[thm-composition-with-a-continuous-function]]); an integrable function is bounded, so such $m$ and $M$ exist ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-bounded-set]], [[def-interval]]).

[L2] Sums and scalar multiples of integrable functions are integrable, with $\int_a^b(\lambda u + \nu w) = \lambda\int_a^b u + \nu\int_a^b w$ ([[thm-linearity-of-the-integral]]).

[L3] If $u \le w$ pointwise on $[a,b]$ and both are integrable then $\int_a^b u \le \int_a^b w$ ([[thm-monotonicity-of-the-integral]]).

[L4] The absolute value $t \mapsto |t|$, the square $t \mapsto t^{2}$ and every polynomial function are continuous on every subset of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], claims 2 and 5, [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L5] For reals $s,t$: $\max\{s,t\} = (s + t + |s-t|)\cdot 2^{-1}$ and $\min\{s,t\} = (s + t - |s-t|)\cdot 2^{-1}$, and $st = \bigl((s+t)^{2} - (s-t)^{2}\bigr)\cdot 4^{-1}$ ([[def-max-min]], [[def-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L6] Absolute value: $-|t| \le t \le |t|$, and $|t| \le c$ follows from $-c \le t \le c$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]]).

[L7] With oriented limits, $\int_v^u u = -\int_u^v u$ and $\int_u^u u = 0$ ([[def-oriented-integral]]).

[L8] Ordered-field arithmetic: adding constants and multiplying by positive reals preserve inequalities, and the order is total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $f$ is bounded, so fix reals $m \le M$ with $f[\,[a,b]\,] \subseteq [m,M]$; the same for $g$, and for $f+g$ and $f-g$, which are integrable by [L2]. [given, L1, L2, choose]

1.2 The maps $t \mapsto |t|$ and $t \mapsto t^{2}$ are continuous on any closed bounded interval, by [L4]. [L4]

2.1 By [L1] applied with $\varphi(t) = |t|$ to $f$, to $g$ and to $f-g$, the functions $|f|$, $|g|$ and $|f-g|$ are integrable. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1]

2.2 By [L1] applied with $\varphi(t) = t^{2}$ to $f$, to $f+g$ and to $f-g$, the functions $f^{2}$, $(f+g)^{2}$ and $(f-g)^{2}$ are integrable. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1]

3.1 By [L5], $fg = \bigl((f+g)^{2}-(f-g)^{2}\bigr)\cdot 4^{-1}$ pointwise, so $fg$ is integrable by [L2]; this completes claim 1. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L2, L5]

3.2 By [L5], $\max(f,g) = \bigl(f + g + |f-g|\bigr)\cdot 2^{-1}$ and $\min(f,g) = \bigl(f+g-|f-g|\bigr)\cdot 2^{-1}$ pointwise, so both are integrable by [L2]; this is claim 2. [step 2.1, L2, L5]

3.3 **Claim 3.** By [L6], $-|f| \le f \le |f|$ pointwise on $[a,b]$, and all three functions are integrable by step 2.1 and [L2]. [step 2.1, L2, L6]

4.1 By [L3] applied twice, $-\int_a^b|f| \le \int_a^b f \le \int_a^b |f|$, using $\int_a^b(-|f|) = -\int_a^b|f|$ from [L2]. [step 3.3, L2, L3]

5.1 Hence $\bigl|\int_a^b f\bigr| \le \int_a^b|f|$ by [L6], which is claim 3. [step 4.1, L6]

6.1 **The oriented form.** For $u = v$ both sides are $0$ by [L7]; for $u < v$ it is claim 3 on $[u,v]$; and for $u > v$ both $\int_u^v f$ and $\int_u^v |f|$ are the negatives of the corresponding integrals over $[v,u]$ by [L7], so the two absolute values are unchanged and claim 3 on $[v,u]$ gives the inequality. [step 5.1, L7, L8] ∎

## Remarks

- **Every integrability clause comes from one theorem plus linearity.** The only input that produces integrability is [[thm-composition-with-a-continuous-function]], with [[thm-linearity-of-the-integral]] recombining the pieces; claim 3 additionally uses [[thm-monotonicity-of-the-integral]], which is the one place an inequality between integrals is needed. The identities of [L5] are algebra, and they are what turns a statement about composing with $|\cdot|$ and $(\cdot)^2$ into statements about products and lattice operations. In particular no new estimate on Darboux sums is made here.

- **The polarisation identity is used, and it is why $f^2$ comes first.** There is no direct route from integrability of $f$ and of $g$ to integrability of $fg$ through the composition theorem, because $(s,t) \mapsto st$ is a function of two variables and the theorem composes with one. Writing $fg$ through squares of sums and differences reduces it to the one-variable case.

- **The inequality of claim 3 is the integral analogue of the triangle inequality**, and like it, it can be strict: for $f(x) = x$ on $[-1,1]$ the left-hand side is $0$ and the right-hand side is $1$.

- **Forward reference, orientation only.** The witness refuting the converse of claim 1 is [[cex-absolute-value-integrable-without-the-function]] on the companion page; nothing above depends on it.

## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]). The **absolute value** of
$x \in F$ is

$$|x| \;:=\; \begin{cases} x & \text{if } x \ge 0, \\ -x & \text{if } x < 0. \end{cases}$$

## Remarks

- The distance between $x$ and $y$ is $|x - y|$.
- The basic algebraic properties ($|x| \ge 0$, $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$,
  $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$, and the characterisation $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$) are
  established in [[lem-of-abs-value]]; the triangle inequality is
  [[lem-of-triangle-inequality]].

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ denotes the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a subset of it.

The notions **upper bound** and **bounded above** are already fixed by
[[def-complete-ordered-field]] and are only recalled here, never redefined:
$u \in \mathbb{R}$ is an *upper bound* of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$, and
$S$ is *bounded above* if it has at least one upper bound. The dual notions are:

- $\ell \in \mathbb{R}$ is a **lower bound** of $S$ if $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.
- $S$ is **bounded below** if it has at least one lower bound.
- $S$ is **bounded** if it is both bounded above and bounded below, that is, if
  there are $\ell, u \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\ell \le s \le u$ for every $s \in S$.

## Remarks

- A bound is an element of $\mathbb{R}$ and is not required to lie in $S$. A
  bound that does lie in $S$ is a maximum or a minimum ([[def-max-min]]), and
  that is a strictly stronger condition ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Bounds come in half-lines: if $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$ then so is every
  $\ell'' \le \ell$, and if $u$ is an upper bound then so is every $u'' \ge u$.
  Consequently a set that has one bound of a given kind has infinitely many, and
  the interesting question is whether the collection of them has a best element,
  which is what a supremum ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) or an infimum
  ([[def-infimum]]) is.
- Bounded above and bounded below are independent conditions. The set
  $A = \{\, n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} : n \ge 1 \,\}$ of canonical naturals of
  $\mathbb{R}$ is bounded below by $0$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]) and is not
  bounded above ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); its reflection $-A$ is bounded above
  and not bounded below ([[lem-reflection]]).
- The empty set is bounded, and vacuously so: every real number is both an upper
  bound and a lower bound of $\emptyset$, since the defining condition quantifies
  over no elements. Having bounds is therefore much weaker than having a least
  upper bound or a greatest lower bound ([[fs-every-set-has-sup]]).

## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq F$.

- $u \in F$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$; $S$ is
  **bounded above** if it has an upper bound.
- $u \in F$ is a **least upper bound** (or **supremum**, $\sup S$) of $S$ if $u$
  is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le u'$ for every upper bound $u'$ of $S$.

$F$ is a **complete ordered field** (equivalently, $F$ has the
**least-upper-bound property**, or is **Dedekind complete**) if every nonempty
$S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$.

## Remarks

- A least upper bound, if it exists, is unique (two least upper bounds are each
  $\le$ the other, so equal by antisymmetry of the order).

## Definition

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]). Write $\mathcal{P}$ for the set of all partitions of
$[a,b]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]) and put

$$\mathcal{L} \;:=\; \{\, L(f,P) \ : \ P \in \mathcal{P} \,\}, \qquad \mathcal{U} \;:=\; \{\, U(f,P) \ : \ P \in \mathcal{P} \,\}$$

for the sets of lower and of upper Darboux sums ([[def-darboux-sums]]).

### Both extrema exist

**$\mathcal{P}$ is nonempty**: the pair $(1, t)$ with $t_0 := a$ and $t_k := b$
for $k \ge 1$ is a partition of $[a,b]$, since $a < b$. So $\mathcal{L}$ and
$\mathcal{U}$ are nonempty.

**$\mathcal{L}$ is bounded above and $\mathcal{U}$ is bounded below.** Fix any
$Q \in \mathcal{P}$. By claim 2 of [[lem-refinement-inequalities]],
$L(f,P) \le U(f,Q)$ for every $P \in \mathcal{P}$, so $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound
of $\mathcal{L}$; and $L(f,Q) \le U(f,P)$ for every $P$, so $L(f,Q)$ is a lower
bound of $\mathcal{U}$.

Hence a nonempty set bounded above has a supremum
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and a nonempty set bounded below has an infimum
([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]), each unique ([[lem-sup-unique]]).
The **lower** and **upper Darboux integrals** of $f$ over $[a,b]$ are the real
numbers

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;:=\; \sup \mathcal{L} \;=\; \sup_{P} L(f,P), \qquad \overline{\int_a^b} f \;:=\; \inf \mathcal{U} \;=\; \inf_{P} U(f,P) .$$

### The lower integral never exceeds the upper one

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f .$$

Indeed, for each fixed $Q \in \mathcal{P}$ the number $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound
of $\mathcal{L}$, so the least upper bound satisfies
$\underline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,Q)$. As $Q$ was arbitrary, $\underline{\int_a^b}f$
is a lower bound of $\mathcal{U}$, and the greatest lower bound satisfies
$\underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f$ ([[def-infimum]]).

Moreover, for **every** partition $P$,

$$L(f,P) \;\le\; \underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; U(f,P) ,$$

the outer inequalities because a member of a set is at most its supremum and at
least its infimum.

### Integrability

$f$ is **Darboux integrable on $[a,b]$**, and on this page simply
**integrable**, when

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;=\; \overline{\int_a^b} f ,$$

and then the common value is written

$$\int_a^b f \qquad \text{or} \qquad \int_a^b f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x ,$$

the **integral of $f$ over $[a,b]$**. It is a single well-determined real
number, being the common value of two numbers each of which is unique
([[lem-sup-unique]]). Without the displayed equality the symbol $\int_a^b f$ is
not defined and is never written.

**The inequality above is the whole difficulty.** By the previous paragraph
integrability is *never* a question of one integral exceeding the other, only of
the gap $\overline{\int_a^b} f - \underline{\int_a^b} f \ge 0$ being $0$; and by
[[thm-riemann-criterion]] that gap is $0$ exactly when a single partition can be
found making $U(f,P) - L(f,P)$ small. Whether that is possible is settled
completely, in terms of the discontinuities of $f$, by
[[thm-lebesgue-criterion]].

**"Riemann integrable" means the same thing here.** The definition above is
Darboux's. Riemann's own definition, in terms of tagged partitions of small
mesh, is [[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]], and the two define the same
class of functions with the same integral by [[thm-darboux-equals-riemann]].
Until that theorem is proved the two phrases are kept apart; after it they are
used interchangeably, as they are throughout the literature.

## Remarks

- **The supremum is over all partitions, and nothing is selected.** Both
  $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{U}$ are sets determined by $f$ and $[a,b]$ alone,
  and $\sup$ and $\inf$ are canonical, so no choice principle is involved in
  forming either integral. Where a choice does enter on this page is recorded in
  [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].

- **Why the lower integral is a supremum and not an infimum.** Refining a
  partition can only increase a lower sum and decrease an upper sum
  ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]]), so the lower sums push up towards the
  integral and the upper sums push down towards it. Taking $\inf \mathcal{L}$
  would return the sum over the coarsest partition and would carry no
  information about $f$ beyond its infimum on $[a,b]$.

- **A bounded $f$ always has both integrals; only their equality can fail.** The
  Dirichlet function on $[0,1]$ has lower integral $0$ and upper integral $1$
  ([[fs-bounded-implies-riemann-integrable]]), which is the standard witness that
  the definition above is not vacuous in either direction.

## Definition

Let $a < b$ be reals, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be **bounded**
([[def-bounded-set]]), so that there is a real $M \ge 0$ with $|f(x)| \le M$ for
every $x \in [a,b]$, and let $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ with
subintervals $I_i = [t_i, t_{i+1}]$ and lengths $\Delta_i = t_{i+1} - t_i$ for
$i < n$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

### The two extreme values on a subinterval

For $i < n$ put

$$m_i \;:=\; \inf f[I_i], \qquad M_i \;:=\; \sup f[I_i], \qquad f[I_i] \;=\; \{\, f(x) : x \in I_i \,\} .$$

**Both exist.** The set $f[I_i]$ is nonempty, because $t_i < t_{i+1}$ makes $I_i$
nonempty ([[def-interval]]), and it is bounded, because $|f(x)| \le M$ for every
$x$ ([[def-bounded-set]]). A nonempty set bounded above has a supremum
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and a nonempty set bounded below has an infimum
([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]); each is unique, so the notations
$\inf f[I_i]$ and $\sup f[I_i]$ name single real numbers ([[lem-sup-unique]]).

**They bracket the values, and each other.** For $x \in I_i$,

$$-M \;\le\; m_i \;\le\; f(x) \;\le\; M_i \;\le\; M ,$$

the outer inequalities because $-M$ is a lower bound and $M$ an upper bound of
$f[I_i]$, and the middle ones by the definitions of infimum and supremum. In
particular $m_i \le M_i$ and $M_i - m_i \le 2M$.

The dependence of $m_i$ and $M_i$ on $f$ and on $P$ is suppressed in the
notation, as is customary; where two partitions are in play the sums below carry
the partition and the extreme values are written out.

### The two Darboux sums

$$L(f,P) \;:=\; \sum_{i<n} m_i \,\Delta_i, \qquad U(f,P) \;:=\; \sum_{i<n} M_i \,\Delta_i ,$$

the finite sums of [[def-finite-sum]], indexed by $i \in \mathbb{N}$ with
$i < n$. Both are real numbers, being finite sums of reals, and

$$L(f,P) \;\le\; U(f,P) ,$$

by monotonicity of finite sums, clause 4 of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], since
$m_i \Delta_i \le M_i \Delta_i$ for every $i < n$: multiplying $m_i \le M_i$ by
$\Delta_i > 0$ preserves the inequality ([[def-ordered-field]]).

### The gap on a subinterval is the oscillation there

For every $i < n$,

$$M_i - m_i \;=\; \omega_f(I_i) \;=\; \sup\{\, |f(x) - f(y)| \ : \ x, y \in I_i \,\} ,$$

the oscillation of $f$ on the set $I_i$ ([[def-oscillation]]). The supremum is a
real number here rather than an extended one, because $f$ is bounded
([[def-oscillation]], [[def-extended-reals]]). The identity is proved in two
inequalities.

*The oscillation is at most the gap.* For $x, y \in I_i$ both $f(x)$ and $f(y)$
lie in $[m_i, M_i]$, so $f(x) - f(y) \le M_i - m_i$ and
$f(y) - f(x) \le M_i - m_i$, whence $|f(x) - f(y)| \le M_i - m_i$
([[lem-of-abs-value]]). So $M_i - m_i$ is an upper bound of the set whose
supremum is $\omega_f(I_i)$.

*The gap is at most the oscillation.* Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real. By the
$\varepsilon$-characterisations of the supremum and the infimum
([[lem-sup-epsilon]], [[lem-inf-epsilon]]) there are $x, y \in I_i$ with
$f(x) > M_i - \varepsilon/2$ and $f(y) < m_i + \varepsilon/2$; then

$$|f(x) - f(y)| \;\ge\; f(x) - f(y) \;>\; (M_i - m_i) - \varepsilon ,$$

so $\omega_f(I_i) > (M_i - m_i) - \varepsilon$. As $\varepsilon > 0$ was
arbitrary, $\omega_f(I_i) \ge M_i - m_i$: otherwise
$\varepsilon := (M_i - m_i) - \omega_f(I_i)$ would be positive and give
$\omega_f(I_i) > \omega_f(I_i)$.

This identity is what connects the Darboux machinery to the pointwise
oscillation of [[def-oscillation]], and it is the hinge of
[[thm-lebesgue-criterion]].

## Remarks

- **Boundedness is a hypothesis of the definition, not of the theorems.** Without
  it $f[I_i]$ may fail to have a supremum in $\mathbb{R}$ and $U(f,P)$ is not
  defined at all. Every statement on this page that mentions $L$ or $U$ therefore
  carries "bounded $f$" in its hypotheses, and none of them is a restriction that
  could be lifted: an unbounded function has no Darboux sums to compare.

- **Why the infimum and the supremum, and not a value of $f$.** Replacing $m_i$
  by $f(\xi_i)$ for a point $\xi_i \in I_i$ gives the Riemann sums of
  [[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]], which depend on a choice of points
  and are not extremal. The Darboux sums are canonical functions of $f$ and $P$
  alone, which is what makes the supremum and infimum over all partitions in
  [[def-darboux-integral]] well posed without any selection.

- **The empty sum does not occur.** A partition has $n \ge 1$
  ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]), so $L(f,P)$ and $U(f,P)$ are sums of at
  least one term. The first term is $m_0 \Delta_0$, over the subinterval
  $[a, t_1]$; the indexing starts at $i = 0$ throughout this page.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{N} \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Q} \subseteq
\mathbb{R}$ denotes the chain of canonical embeddings
([[lem-nat-embeds-int]], [[lem-int-embeds-rat]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and
each set is identified with its image in $\mathbb{R}$, as elsewhere in this
library; for a natural $q$ the real $\iota(q) = q \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ is the
canonical natural ([[def-canonical-natural]]), and $\iota(q) > 0$ for $q \ge 1$
([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). A real is **rational** when it lies in
$\mathbb{Q}$ and **irrational** otherwise; both sets are dense in $\mathbb{R}$
([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]).

### The Dirichlet function

$$\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}} : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad \mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(x) := \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } x \in \mathbb{Q},\\ 0 & \text{if } x \notin \mathbb{Q}.\end{cases}$$

This is the indicator of the rationals. It is a function because every real
either lies in $\mathbb{Q}$ or does not, and the two clauses are exclusive.

### The least denominator of a rational

Let $x \in \mathbb{Q}$ and put

$$Q(x) \;:=\; \{\, q \in \mathbb{N} \;:\; q \ge 1 \ \text{ and } \ \iota(q)\,x \in \mathbb{Z} \,\}.$$

**$Q(x)$ is nonempty.** Every rational is $a/b$ with $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $b$ a
positive integer ([[lem-int-embeds-rat]]), and a positive integer is $\iota(q)$
for a unique natural $q \ge 1$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]); then
$\iota(q)\,x = a \in \mathbb{Z}$, so $q \in Q(x)$.

By the well-ordering principle ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]) the nonempty
subset $Q(x) \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ has a least element. Write

$$q(x) \;:=\; \min Q(x) \;\ge\; 1,$$

the **least denominator** of $x$, and $p(x) := \iota(q(x))\,x \in \mathbb{Z}$,
so that

$$x \;=\; \frac{p(x)}{\iota(q(x))} .$$

Nothing is selected here: $q(x)$ is the least element of a set determined by
$x$, so it is a function of $x$ alone.

**The least denominator is the denominator in lowest terms.** The integers
$p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are coprime ([[def-coprime]]). Indeed put
$d := \gcd(p(x), q(x))$, which satisfies $d \ge 1$ because $q(x) \ge 1$ makes the
pair different from $(0,0)$ ([[lem-gcd-basic-values]],
[[def-common-divisor-and-gcd]]). Then $d$ divides $q(x)$, so $q(x)/d$ is a
natural number $\ge 1$, and $\iota(q(x)/d) = \iota(q(x))/d$ because $\iota$
carries products of naturals to products ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]); hence

$$\iota(q(x)/d)\,x \;=\; \frac{\iota(q(x))\,x}{d} \;=\; \frac{p(x)}{d} \;\in\; \mathbb{Z},$$

so $q(x)/d \in Q(x)$ and therefore $q(x)/d \ge q(x)$, which forces $d = 1$.
**Conversely, a lowest-terms denominator is the least one, so the description is
unambiguous.** Suppose $x = p/\iota(q)$ with $q \ge 1$ a natural, $p \in \mathbb{Z}$
and $\gcd(p,q) = 1$. Then $q \in Q(x)$, so $q_{0} := q(x) \le q$; and from
$p/\iota(q) = p(x)/\iota(q_{0})$ we get $q_{0}p = q\,p(x)$ in $\mathbb{Z}$, so
$q \mid q_{0}p$, and $\gcd(p,q) = 1$ gives $q \mid q_{0}$
([[lem-coprime-divides-product]], claim 1), hence $q \le q_{0}$. So $q = q(x)$:
writing $x = p/q$ "in lowest terms with $q \ge 1$" and taking $q = q(x)$ describe
the same integer, and [[cor-gcd-quotients-coprime]] is what produces such a
representation from an arbitrary one.

### Thomae's function

$$t : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad t(x) := \begin{cases} 1/\iota(q(x)) & \text{if } x \in \mathbb{Q},\\ 0 & \text{if } x \notin \mathbb{Q}.\end{cases}$$

It is also called the **popcorn function** or the **ruler function**. The value
is well defined because $q(x)$ is, and $\iota(q(x)) \ge 1 > 0$ is invertible.

**Boundary values, stated rather than left to the reader.**

- $t(0) = 1$. Indeed $\iota(1)\cdot 0 = 0 \in \mathbb{Z}$, so $1 \in Q(0)$ and
  $q(0) = 1$; the representation is $0 = 0/1$.
- $t(m) = 1$ for every integer $m$, by the same computation with $1 \in Q(m)$.
- $0 < t(x) \le 1$ for every rational $x$, since $\iota(q(x)) \ge 1$; and
  $t(x) = 0$ exactly at the irrationals.

**On the range.** The values of $t$ are $0$ and the reciprocals
$1/\iota(q)$ of the canonical naturals $q \ge 1$; every such value is attained,
$1/\iota(q)$ being the value at the rational $1/\iota(q)$ itself, whose least
denominator is $q$ because $\iota(k)/\iota(q) \in \mathbb{Z}$ with
$1 \le k < q$ would give a positive integer smaller than $1$.

## Definition

Throughout this page $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), in particular an ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]]) and a field ([[def-field]]), and $\mathbb{N}$ is the set
of natural numbers ([[def-natural-numbers]]) with successor $\sigma(n) = n + 1$
([[def-nat-addition]]).

Let $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a sequence of reals, written $a_k$ for
$a(k)$. **Finite sums and finite products of $a$ are defined by recursion on the
upper index**, which is legitimate because of the recursion theorem
([[thm-recursion]]). That theorem produces a function of one variable, so the
running index has to be carried along inside the value: applying it to the set
$A = \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$, the starting element $(0, 0)$ and the function
$f(n, s) = (\sigma(n),\, s + a_n)$ gives a unique
$g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$ with

$$g(0) = (0, 0), \qquad g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n)) \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Write $g(n) = \big(\pi_1(g(n)),\, \Sigma_n\big)$ for its two coordinates.

**The first coordinate is the index itself, and that is a small induction, not an
observation** ([[thm-induction-principle]]). Indeed $\pi_1(g(0)) = 0$; and if
$\pi_1(g(n)) = n$, then
$g(\sigma(n)) = f\big(\pi_1(g(n)), \Sigma_n\big) = \big(\sigma(\pi_1(g(n))),\, \Sigma_n + a_{\pi_1(g(n))}\big) = \big(\sigma(n),\, \Sigma_n + a_n\big)$,
so $\pi_1(g(\sigma(n))) = \sigma(n)$. By induction $\pi_1(g(n)) = n$ for every
$n \in \mathbb{N}$. Only now may the second coordinate of the two displayed
clauses be read off, and doing so gives

$$\Sigma_0 = 0, \qquad \Sigma_{\sigma(n)} = \Sigma_n + a_n .$$

$\Sigma$ is moreover the **unique** function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with those
two properties: if $\Sigma'$ also has them then $n \mapsto (n, \Sigma'_n)$ satisfies
the two clauses defining $g$, hence equals $g$ by the uniqueness clause of
[[thm-recursion]], so $\Sigma' = \Sigma$.

We write $\sum_{k < n} a_k := \Sigma_n$. The same construction with starting
element $(0, 1)$ and $f(n, p) = (\sigma(n),\, p \cdot a_n)$, with the same
induction on the first coordinate and the same uniqueness argument, gives the
unique $\Pi : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with

$$\Pi_0 = 1, \qquad \Pi_{\sigma(n)} = \Pi_n \cdot a_n ,$$

and we write $\prod_{k < n} a_k := \Pi_n$.

**Notation.** For $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ we abbreviate

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \sum_{k < n+1} a_k, \qquad \prod_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \prod_{k < n+1} a_k,$$

and, for a general lower index $m$ with $m \le n + 1$, writing $d = n + 1 - m$
for the number of terms,

$$\sum_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \sum_{j < d} a_{m+j}, \qquad \prod_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \prod_{j < d} a_{m+j} .$$

When $m = n + 1$ we have $d = 0$ and the sum is **empty**, with value $0$, while
the empty product has value $1$. In the same spirit $\sum_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ is
notation for the empty sum $\Sigma_0 = 0$ and $\prod_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ for the
empty product $\Pi_0 = 1$; the index $-1$ never occurs as an element of
$\mathbb{N}$ and is only a way of writing "no terms".

Only finitely many values of $a$ enter $\sum_{k<n} a_k$, so the notation
$\sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\prod_{k<n} a_k$ is also used for a list
$a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$ of reals given without reference to any extension of the
list to all of $\mathbb{N}$: extend the list by $a_k = 0$ (respectively
$a_k = 1$) for $k \ge n$ and apply the definition above.

## Remarks

- **Why recursion and not "$a_0 + a_1 + \cdots + a_{n-1}$".** The dots are not a
  definition: they presuppose that the displayed pattern determines a value for
  every $n$, which is exactly what the recursion theorem
  ([[thm-recursion]]) supplies, and its uniqueness clause is what makes
  $\sum_{k<n} a_k$ a single well-determined real rather than a family of choices.
  Associativity and commutativity of addition are *not* used in the definition;
  they are used in the laws proved from it ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).
- **Naturals and rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$ (a convention used on the whole
  page).** A natural number $n$ and a rational number $r$ are not literally
  elements of $\mathbb{R}$: they enter $\mathbb{R}$ through the canonical
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$, which is an injective,
  order-preserving field homomorphism ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), restricting on
  positive naturals to $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} = 1_\mathbb{R} + \cdots + 1_\mathbb{R}$
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). Following ordinary practice, and only where no
  confusion is possible, we write $n$ for $\iota(n)$ and $r$ for $\iota(r)$; so,
  for instance, $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k<n} a_k$ means
  $\iota(n)^{-1} \cdot \sum_{k<n} a_k$, which makes sense because
  $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$. Exponents are the one place where the
  identification is deliberately NOT made: in $a^n$ and $a^r$ the exponent stays
  a natural, an integer or a rational ([[def-integer-power]],
  [[def-rational-power]]), never a real.
- The two indexings are related by $\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k = \sum_{k < n+1} a_k$, so
  a statement proved for one is available for the other. Sums over $k < n$ are
  the primitive form here because $\Sigma_0$, the empty sum, is then the base
  case of every induction, and no index outside $\mathbb{N}$ is ever needed.

## Definition

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $\ell \in \mathbb{R}$. Then $\ell$ is a
**greatest lower bound**, or **infimum**, of $S$ if both of the following hold:

- $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$ ([[def-bounded-set]]), that is, $\ell \le s$ for
  every $s \in S$;
- $\ell' \le \ell$ for every lower bound $\ell'$ of $S$.

Written out in one line:

$$\ell \text{ is an infimum of } S \iff \big[(\forall s \in S)\, \ell \le s\big] \text{ and } \big[(\forall \ell' \in \mathbb{R})\, \big((\forall s \in S)\, \ell' \le s\big) \Rightarrow \ell' \le \ell\big].$$

An infimum, when it exists, is unique ([[lem-sup-unique]]), so we may write
$\inf S$ for it.

## Remarks

- This is the exact dual of the least upper bound (supremum) of
  [[def-complete-ordered-field]]: reverse every inequality and swap "least" for
  "greatest". The two notions are related by reflection through $0$
  ([[lem-reflection]]).
- Existence is deliberately *not* part of the definition. That every nonempty
  subset of $\mathbb{R}$ which is bounded below actually has an infimum is a
  theorem, [[thm-infimum-property]], derived from the least-upper-bound property;
  it is not an axiom and it is not free.
- As with a supremum, an infimum need not belong to $S$; when it does, it is the
  minimum of $S$ ([[def-max-min]]).
- The usable form of the definition in later arguments is the epsilon
  characterisation [[lem-inf-epsilon]]: $\ell = \inf S$ exactly when $\ell$ is a
  lower bound that cannot be raised by any positive amount without losing that
  property.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $m \in \mathbb{R}$.

- $m$ is a **maximum** (or *greatest element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $s \le m$
  for every $s \in S$.
- $m$ is a **minimum** (or *least element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $m \le s$
  for every $s \in S$.

A set has at most one maximum: if $m_1$ and $m_2$ are both maxima then
$m_1 \in S$ gives $m_1 \le m_2$ and $m_2 \in S$ gives $m_2 \le m_1$, so
$m_1 = m_2$ by antisymmetry of the order, which is immediate from the trichotomy
axiom of an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).
The same argument applies to minima, so we may write $\max S$ and $\min S$.

## Remarks

- A maximum is precisely an upper bound of $S$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]])
  that happens to lie in $S$; a minimum is a lower bound of $S$
  ([[def-bounded-set]]) that lies in $S$. In particular a set with a maximum is
  bounded above and a set with a minimum is bounded below.
- The empty set has neither a maximum nor a minimum, because the requirement
  $m \in S$ cannot be met.
- The membership requirement $m \in S$ is exactly what separates a maximum from a
  supremum, and it is the theme of this page. A supremum is a bound on the set
  and is not asked to belong to it; a maximum is an element of the set. The two
  agree exactly when the supremum happens to be attained ([[lem-max-is-sup]]),
  and they genuinely differ in general ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has both a maximum and a minimum
  ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]), which is what licenses the notation
  $\max\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$. Infinite sets need not: the failure of attainment is
  an infinitary phenomenon.

## Definition

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ ([[def-field]]) together with a subset
$P \subseteq F$, the set of **positive** elements (the *positive cone*),
satisfying:

- **(O1) Trichotomy.** For each $x \in F$, exactly one of the following holds:
  $x \in P$, or $x = 0$, or $-x \in P$.
- **(O2) Closure.** If $x, y \in P$ then $x + y \in P$ and $x \cdot y \in P$.

We write $x > 0$ for $x \in P$ (read "$x$ is positive"), and define the order by

$$a < b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; b - a \in P, \qquad a \le b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; a < b \text{ or } a = b.$$

Thus $a > b$ means $b < a$, and $a \ge b$ means $b \le a$. An element $x$ with
$-x \in P$ (equivalently $x < 0$) is called **negative**.

## Remarks

- By trichotomy applied to $b - a$, for any $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$,
  $a = b$, $a > b$ holds; this makes $\le$ a total order.
- (O2) says the positives are closed under addition and multiplication: sums and
  products of positives are positive.
- The rationals ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and both constructions of the reals
  ([[thm-reals-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-dedekind-ordered-field]]) are ordered
  fields, so every fact proved here from (O1)-(O2) holds in each of them.

## Definition

**Standing hypothesis for this page.** Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete
ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]),
$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers and **contains $0$**
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[def-nat-order]]), $\iota : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$
is the canonical natural ([[def-canonical-natural]]), and $a, b$ are reals with

$$a \;<\; b .$$

Intervals and their lengths are those of [[def-interval]]; finite sums are those
of [[def-finite-sum]], indexed as $\sum_{i<n}$ over $i \in \mathbb{N}$.

### Partitions

A **partition of $[a,b]$** is a pair $P = (n, t)$ consisting of a natural number
$n \ge 1$ and a sequence $t : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-sequence]]) with

$$t_0 = a, \qquad t_i < t_{i+1} \ \text{ for every } i < n, \qquad t_k = b \ \text{ for every } k \ge n .$$

The tail convention on the third clause is bookkeeping only: it makes $t$ a
genuine sequence, so that the finite-sum laws of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] apply to
it verbatim, and it costs nothing because no index above $n$ is ever read. The
first two clauses say exactly that

$$a \;=\; t_0 \;<\; t_1 \;<\; \dots \;<\; t_n \;=\; b ,$$

the last equality because $t_n = b$ by the third clause. In particular
$i \mapsto t_i$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on
$\{\, i \in \mathbb{N} : i \le n \,\}$ ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]),
and $a \le t_i \le b$ for every $i \le n$.

The **point set** of $P$ is the finite set

$$\operatorname{pts}(P) \;:=\; \{\, t_i \ : \ i \le n \,\} \;\subseteq\; [a,b], \qquad a, b \in \operatorname{pts}(P) .$$

The **subintervals** of $P$ are

$$I_i \;:=\; [\,t_i,\ t_{i+1}\,] \qquad (i < n),$$

and their **lengths** are $\Delta_i := t_{i+1} - t_i$. Each $\Delta_i > 0$, so
each $I_i$ is a nondegenerate closed bounded interval ([[def-interval]]). There
are $n$ of them and they are indexed from $i = 0$, not from $i = 1$: the first
subinterval is $[t_0, t_1] = [a, t_1]$.

**The lengths sum to $b - a$.** By the telescoping law, clause 5 of
[[lem-finite-sum-laws]],

$$\sum_{i<n} \Delta_i \;=\; \sum_{i<n} (t_{i+1} - t_i) \;=\; t_n - t_0 \;=\; b - a .$$

**The mesh.** The set $\{\, \Delta_i : i < n \,\}$ is a nonempty finite set of
reals, nonempty because $n \ge 1$, so it has a maximum
([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]). The **mesh** of $P$ is

$$\|P\| \;:=\; \max\{\, \Delta_i \ : \ i < n \,\} \;>\; 0 ,$$

and $\Delta_i \le \|P\|$ for every $i < n$.

**The uniform partition.** For a natural $N \ge 1$, the **uniform partition of
$[a,b]$ into $N$ parts** is $U_N := (N, t)$ with

$$t_i \;:=\; a + \iota(i)\,\frac{b-a}{\iota(N)} \quad (i \le N), \qquad t_k := b \quad (k \ge N).$$

This is a partition: $t_0 = a$; $t_N = a + (b-a) = b$; and $t_{i+1} - t_i =
(b-a)/\iota(N) > 0$ for $i < N$, because $\iota(N) > 0$ and $\iota(i+1) =
\iota(i) + 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[def-canonical-natural]]). Its
subinterval lengths are all equal to $(b-a)/\iota(N)$, so

$$\|U_N\| \;=\; \frac{b-a}{\iota(N)} .$$

### A partition is determined by its point set

**Claim.** If $P = (n,t)$ and $P' = (n', t')$ are partitions of $[a,b]$ with
$\operatorname{pts}(P) = \operatorname{pts}(P')$, then $n = n'$ and $t_i = t'_i$
for every $i \le n$.

*Proof.* First, $t_i = t'_i$ for every $i \le \min\{n,n'\}$, by induction on $i$
([[thm-induction-principle]]). For $i = 0$ both equal $a$. Suppose $t_j = t'_j$
for all $j \le i$ and $i + 1 \le \min\{n,n'\}$. The set
$S := \{\, x \in \operatorname{pts}(P) : x > t_i \,\}$ has $t_{i+1}$ as its least
element: $t_{i+1} \in S$, and any $x \in S$ is $t_j$ for some $j \le n$ with
$t_j > t_i$, which forces $j > i$ because $t$ is increasing on indices $\le n$,
hence $j \ge i+1$ and $x = t_j \ge t_{i+1}$. The same argument in $P'$ makes
$t'_{i+1}$ the least element of
$\{\, x \in \operatorname{pts}(P') : x > t'_i \,\}$, which is the same set $S$,
since the point sets agree and $t'_i = t_i$. A set has at most one least element
([[def-max-min]]), so $t_{i+1} = t'_{i+1}$.

Second, $n = n'$. If $n < n'$ then $t'_n = t_n = b$ by the previous paragraph,
while $t'_n < t'_{n'} = b$ because $t'$ is increasing on indices $\le n'$ and
$n < n'$; that is impossible. Exchanging the roles of $P$ and $P'$ rules out
$n' < n$. $\square$

So the map $P \mapsto \operatorname{pts}(P)$ is injective, and a partition may be
named by its point set whenever one is exhibited.

### Inserting a point

Let $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ and let $c \in [a,b]$. Define a
partition $P + c$ of $[a,b]$ as follows.

- If $c \in \operatorname{pts}(P)$, put $P + c := P$.
- Otherwise $c \ne a$ and $c \ne b$, so $a < c < b$. The set
  $T := \{\, t_i : i \le n \text{ and } t_i < c \,\}$ is a nonempty finite set of
  reals, nonempty because $t_0 = a < c$, so it has a maximum
  ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]); let $i_0 \le n$ be the unique index with
  $t_{i_0} = \max T$, unique because $t$ is injective on indices $\le n$. Then
  $i_0 < n$, since $t_n = b > c$ puts $t_n \notin T$; and
  $$t_{i_0} \;<\; c \;<\; t_{i_0+1},$$
  the right inequality because $t_{i_0+1} \ne c$ (as $c \notin \operatorname{pts}(P)$)
  and $t_{i_0+1} < c$ would put $t_{i_0+1} \in T$ with $t_{i_0+1} > t_{i_0} = \max T$.
  Put $P + c := (n+1, s)$ with
  $$s_i := t_i \ (i \le i_0), \qquad s_{i_0+1} := c, \qquad s_i := t_{i-1} \ (i_0 + 2 \le i \le n+1), \qquad s_k := b \ (k \ge n+1).$$

In both cases $P + c$ is a partition of $[a,b]$ and

$$\operatorname{pts}(P + c) \;=\; \operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \{c\}, \qquad \|P+c\| \;\le\; \|P\| .$$

The displayed identity is immediate from the two cases. For the mesh: in the
first case nothing changes; in the second the list of subinterval lengths of
$P + c$ is that of $P$ with $\Delta_{i_0}$ replaced by the two numbers
$c - t_{i_0}$ and $t_{i_0+1} - c$, each of which is smaller than
$\Delta_{i_0} = (c - t_{i_0}) + (t_{i_0+1} - c)$ because the other is positive.
So every length of $P + c$ is at most a length of $P$, and the maximum cannot
increase. Finally the index count grows by exactly $1$ in the second case and
not at all in the first.

### Refinement and the common refinement

$P'$ **refines** $P$, and is a **refinement** of $P$, when

$$\operatorname{pts}(P) \;\subseteq\; \operatorname{pts}(P') .$$

Let $P = (n,t)$ and $Q = (m,s)$ be partitions of $[a,b]$. Applying the recursion
theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) to the set $\mathbb{N} \times \mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$,
where $\mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$ is the set of partitions of $[a,b]$, with starting
element $(0, P)$ and the map $(j, R) \mapsto (j+1,\ R + s_j)$ — legitimate
because $s_j \in [a,b]$ for every $j \in \mathbb{N}$ — gives a unique family
$(R_j)_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ of partitions with $R_0 = P$ and $R_{j+1} = R_j + s_j$.
The **common refinement** of $P$ and $Q$ is

$$P \vee Q \;:=\; R_{m+1} .$$

**Its point set is the union.** By induction on $j$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]),
$\operatorname{pts}(R_j) = \operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \{\, s_l : l < j \,\}$;
taking $j = m+1$ gives

$$\operatorname{pts}(P \vee Q) \;=\; \operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \operatorname{pts}(Q).$$

Hence $P \vee Q$ refines both $P$ and $Q$; by the uniqueness claim above it is
the **only** partition with that point set, so $P \vee Q = Q \vee P$, and

$$P' \text{ refines } P \quad \Longrightarrow \quad P \vee P' = P' ,$$

since then $\operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \operatorname{pts}(P') =
\operatorname{pts}(P')$.

**Two size bounds, both used later.** Writing $n_R$ for the first component of a
partition $R$:

$$\|P \vee Q\| \;\le\; \|P\|, \qquad n_{P \vee Q} \;\le\; n_P + n_Q - 1 .$$

The first is the mesh bound above applied $m+1$ times. For the second, each
insertion raises the index count by at most $1$, and the two insertions of
$s_0 = a$ and $s_m = b$ raise it by $0$, since $a$ and $b$ already lie in
$\operatorname{pts}(P)$ and hence in $\operatorname{pts}(R_j)$ for every $j$; so
at most $m - 1$ of the $m+1$ insertions increase it.

### The index map of a refinement

Let $P' = (n',t')$ refine $P = (n,t)$. For each $i \le n$ the point $t_i$ lies in
$\operatorname{pts}(P')$, so there is exactly one $\varphi(i) \le n'$ with
$t'_{\varphi(i)} = t_i$, uniqueness because $t'$ is injective on indices $\le n'$.
The resulting map $\varphi$ satisfies

$$\varphi(0) = 0, \qquad \varphi(n) = n', \qquad \varphi(i) < \varphi(i+1) \ \ (i < n),$$

the first two because $t'_0 = a = t_0$ and $t'_{n'} = b = t_n$ together with
injectivity, and the third because $t_i < t_{i+1}$ and $t'$ is increasing on
indices $\le n'$. In particular $n \le n'$. Moreover, for $i < n$ and
$\varphi(i) \le j < \varphi(i+1)$,

$$I'_j \;=\; [\,t'_j,\ t'_{j+1}\,] \;\subseteq\; [\,t_i,\ t_{i+1}\,] \;=\; I_i ,$$

because $t_i = t'_{\varphi(i)} \le t'_j$ and $t'_{j+1} \le t'_{\varphi(i+1)} = t_{i+1}$.

**The blocks are counted by telescoping.** By clause 5 of
[[lem-finite-sum-laws]],
$\sum_{i<n}\big(\varphi(i+1) - \varphi(i)\big) = \varphi(n) - \varphi(0) = n'$,
so, subtracting $\sum_{i<n} 1 = n$,

$$\sum_{i<n} \big(\varphi(i+1) - \varphi(i) - 1\big) \;=\; n' - n ,$$

a sum of $n$ nonnegative integers, one for each block, which vanishes exactly at
the blocks consisting of a single index. This identity is the whole content of
the quantitative bound in [[lem-refinement-inequalities]], and it is also why
$n \le n'$.

Finally, the lengths inside a block sum to the length of the block:

$$\sum_{j = \varphi(i)}^{\varphi(i+1)-1} \Delta'_j \;=\; t'_{\varphi(i+1)} - t'_{\varphi(i)} \;=\; t_{i+1} - t_i \;=\; \Delta_i \qquad (i < n),$$

again by telescoping, applied to the sequence $l \mapsto t'_{\varphi(i)+l}$ and
read through the index-shift convention of [[def-finite-sum]].

## Remarks

- **Why $a < b$ is a standing hypothesis and not a case.** With $a = b$ the
  displayed chain $a = t_0 < \dots < t_n = b$ is unsatisfiable for $n \ge 1$, and
  admitting $n = 0$ would give a partition with no subintervals, an empty mesh
  set and no maximum. Every statement on this page is about a nondegenerate
  closed bounded interval, and the convention $\int_a^a f := 0$ is not adopted
  here because nothing below needs it.

- **The subintervals overlap at their shared endpoints, and that is harmless.**
  $I_i \cap I_{i+1} = \{t_{i+1}\}$, so the union $\bigcup_{i<n} I_i = [a,b]$ is
  not disjoint. Every quantity attached to a partition below is a sum over $i<n$
  of a number times $\Delta_i$, and a single point contributes length $0$, so no
  statement on this page is sensitive to the double counting of the $n-1$
  interior points.

- **Refinement is a relation between point sets, not between lists.** Defining it
  as "$P'$ is obtained from $P$ by inserting points" would be the same relation,
  by the uniqueness claim above, but it would make every proof carry an
  insertion order. The index map $\varphi$ recovers the list-level picture when
  it is wanted, and it is what [[lem-refinement-inequalities]] actually uses.

## Statement

Let $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be sequences of reals, let
$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, and let $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, with finite sums and
finite products as in [[def-finite-sum]]. Then:

1. **Additivity.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k$.
2. **Scaling.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k$; in particular $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda = n\lambda$, where $n$ denotes the canonical natural $\iota(n) \in \mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).
3. **Splitting.** If $m \le n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k$, and $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n} a_k = \Big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k\Big)$.
4. **Monotonicity.** If $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$. In particular, if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, every single term satisfies $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$ for $j < n$, and $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ forces $a_k = 0$ for every $k < n$.
5. **Telescoping.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}\big(c_{k+1} - c_k\big) = c_n - c_0$.
6. **Products.** $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k) = \Big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\Big)$; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, and if $a_k > 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k > 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\lambda$, and naturals $m, n$. Write $\Sigma_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\Pi_n = \prod_{k<n} a_k$.

[L1] Recursion clauses ([[def-finite-sum]]): $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ and $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n$; $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1$ and $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) \cdot a_n$; and $\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k = \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j}$ for $m \le n$, likewise for products.

[L2] Field axioms: addition and multiplication are associative and commutative, $0$ and $1$ are the identities, $x - x = 0$, and multiplication distributes over addition ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]); and $0 \cdot x = 0$, which is not an axiom but a lemma ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

[L3] Induction principle: a property holding at $0$ and inherited by successors holds at every natural ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L4] Adding inequalities: $x \le y$ and $u \le v$ imply $x + u \le y + v$. [[lem-of-add-order]] states the STRICT forms and only those ($x < y \Rightarrow x + c < y + c$, and $x < y$ with $u < v$ giving $x + u < y + v$); the nonstrict form used throughout below is those two together with the cases $x = y$ and $u = v$, which are settled by trichotomy, the order being total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] The canonical embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a field homomorphism, so $\iota(0) = 0$ and $\iota(n+1) = \iota(n) + 1$, and $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L6] Sign rules: a product of two positives is positive ([[lem-of-sign-rules]], claim 1), and a product of two nonnegatives is nonnegative, since a factor equal to $0$ makes the product $0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]) and otherwise both factors are positive; and $1 > 0$, which is proved in [[cor-of-one-positive]] and stated by none of the items named above.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 0$: every claim holds at $n = 0$, since both sides of claim 1 are $0 = 0 + 0$, both sides of claim 2 are $0 = \lambda \cdot 0$ and $0 = \iota(0)\lambda$, claim 4 reads $0 \le 0$ with no term to bound and the hypothesis $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ giving nothing to prove, claim 5 reads $0 = c_0 - c_0$, and claim 6 reads $1 = 1 \cdot 1$ with $1 > 0$. [base, L1, L2, L5, L6]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for this $n$ and for all sequences $a, b, c$ and all $\lambda$. [ih]

1.3 Splitting, claim 3, by a separate induction on the number of trailing terms $d = n - m$ with $m$ fixed: for $d = 0$ the claim reads $\sum_{k<m} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + 0$ and $\prod_{k<m} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\big) \cdot 1$, which hold; and if $\sum_{k<m+d} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d} a_{m+j}$, then $\sum_{k<m+d+1} a_k = \sum_{k<m+d} a_k + a_{m+d} = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \big(\sum_{j<d} a_{m+j} + a_{m+d}\big) = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d+1} a_{m+j}$ by associativity, and identically for products with $1$ in place of $0$ and multiplication in place of addition, so induction on $d$ gives claim 3 for every $m \le n$. [L1, L2, L3]

2.1 Additivity at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k\big) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) + \big(\sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n\big) = \sum_{k<n+1} a_k + \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$, using the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of addition. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Scaling at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda a_k = \sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda\big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) = \lambda \sum_{k<n+1} a_k$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and distributivity; taking $a_k = 1$ for all $k$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda = \sum_{k<n} \lambda + \lambda = \iota(n)\lambda + \lambda = (\iota(n) + 1)\lambda = \iota(n+1)\lambda$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L5]

2.3 Monotonicity at $n+1$: assume $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n+1$; then $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$, so the hypothesis gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$, and adding the inequality $a_n \le b_n$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n \le \sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n = \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$. [step 1.2, L1, L4]

2.4 Telescoping at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(c_{k+1} - c_k) = \sum_{k<n}(c_{k+1} - c_k) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = (c_n - c_0) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = c_{n+1} - c_0$, by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and the field identities. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.5 Products at $n+1$: $\prod_{k<n+1}(a_k b_k) = \big(\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k)\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n+1} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n+1} b_k\big)$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of multiplication; and if every $a_k \ge 0$ for $k < n+1$ then $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) a_n$ is a product of two nonnegatives, hence nonnegative, with the same argument giving positivity from positivity since $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1 > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L6]

3.1 Consequences of monotonicity, completing claim 4: monotonicity itself holds at every $n$, by the induction principle applied to the base case of step 1.1 and the successor step 2.3, so it is available for an arbitrary $n$ in what follows; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then comparing with the zero sequence gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge \sum_{k<n} 0 = 0$; for $j < n$ splitting at $j$ and then at $j+1$ writes $\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<j} a_k + a_j + \sum_{k=j+1}^{n-1} a_k$ with the first and third summands $\ge 0$, so $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$; and if moreover $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ then $0 \le a_j \le 0$ for every $j < n$, so $a_j = 0$. [step 1.1, step 2.3, step 1.3, L3, L4, L2]

4.1 By the induction principle claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and claim 3 was proved in step 1.3 with its consequences in step 3.1, so all six laws hold. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, step 2.5, step 1.3, step 3.1, L3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfy

$$m \;\le\; f(x) \;\le\; M \qquad \text{for every } x \in [a,b],$$

with $m, M$ real. Then $f$ is bounded ([[def-bounded-set]]), so its Darboux sums
and integrals are defined ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-darboux-integral]]), and
for **every** partition $P$ of $[a,b]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]])

$$m(b-a) \;\le\; L(f,P) \;\le\; \underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; U(f,P) \;\le\; M(b-a) .$$

In particular, taking $f$ to be the constant function with value $c$:

$$\int_a^b c \;=\; c\,(b-a) ,$$

the constant function being integrable, with $L(f,P) = U(f,P) = c(b-a)$ for
every partition $P$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, reals $m \le M$, and $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ with $m \le f(x) \le M$ for every $x \in [a,b]$. Let $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$, with subintervals $I_i$ and lengths $\Delta_i$ for $i < n$.

[L1] $\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = b - a$, every $\Delta_i > 0$, and $n \ge 1$; each $I_i$ is a nonempty subset of $[a,b]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-interval]]).

[L2] $m_i = \inf f[I_i]$ and $M_i = \sup f[I_i]$ exist, $L(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}m_i\Delta_i$ and $U(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}M_i\Delta_i$, and $m_i \le f(x) \le M_i$ for $x \in I_i$ ([[def-darboux-sums]]).

[L3] $L(f,P) \le \underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,P)$ for every partition $P$; $f$ is integrable exactly when the two integrals are equal, and then $\int_a^b f$ is their common value ([[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L4] An infimum is the greatest lower bound and a supremum the least upper bound; a set with a single element has that element as both ([[def-infimum]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L5] Finite sums: scaling, monotonicity in the terms, and $\sum_{i<n}\lambda\,\Delta_i = \lambda\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L6] Ordered-field arithmetic: multiplying an inequality by a positive quantity preserves it, adding a constant preserves it, and the order is transitive; $|x| \le \max\{|m|,|M|\}$ whenever $m \le x \le M$ ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $f$ is bounded: $|f(x)| \le \max\{|m|,|M|\}$ for every $x \in [a,b]$ by [L6], so the Darboux sums and integrals of [L2] and [L3] are defined. [given, L6]

1.2 For every $i < n$: $m$ is a lower bound of $f[I_i]$ and $M$ an upper bound, since $I_i \subseteq [a,b]$; the set $f[I_i]$ is nonempty by [L1]. Hence $m \le m_i$ and $M_i \le M$ by [L4]. [given, L1, L2, L4]

1.3 **The constant case, treated on its own.** Suppose in addition that $f$ is the constant function with value $c$, that is $f(x) = c$ for every $x \in [a,b]$; the general argument below does not use this supposition. Then $f[I_i] = \{c\}$ for every $i < n$ by [L1], so $m_i = M_i = c$ by [L4], and $L(f,P) = U(f,P) = \sum_{i<n} c\,\Delta_i = c(b-a)$ by [L5] and [L1]. [L1, L2, L4, L5]

2.1 $L(f,P) \ge m(b-a)$: by step 1.2 and $\Delta_i > 0$ one has $m_i\Delta_i \ge m\Delta_i$ for every $i < n$, so monotonicity and scaling in [L5] give $L(f,P) \ge \sum_{i<n} m\,\Delta_i = m\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = m(b-a)$ by [L1]. [step 1.2, L1, L5, L6]

2.2 $U(f,P) \le M(b-a)$: the same argument with $M_i \le M$ gives $U(f,P) \le \sum_{i<n}M\,\Delta_i = M(b-a)$. [step 1.2, L1, L5, L6]

3.1 Combining steps 2.1 and 2.2 with the chain of [L3] gives the displayed five-term inequality for every partition $P$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L3]

4.1 Hence, still under the supposition of step 1.3 that $f$ is constant with value $c$, the set of lower sums and the set of upper sums are both $\{c(b-a)\}$, so $\underline{\int_a^b} f = \overline{\int_a^b} f = c(b-a)$ by [L4], $f$ is integrable, and $\int_a^b c = c(b-a)$ by [L3]. [step 1.3, L3, L4] ∎

## Remarks

- **The five-term chain is the only estimate most of this page needs.** Every integrability proof below produces one partition and controls $U(f,P) - L(f,P)$; the chain then locates both integrals inside an interval of that length, and [[thm-riemann-criterion]] turns the observation into an equivalence.

- **The bounds are sharp, but equality does not characterize constants.** Constant functions show that neither outer coefficient can be improved. Nonconstant functions can also attain equality: for the Dirichlet indicator on $[0,1]$, every partition has $L(f,P) = 0$ and $U(f,P) = 1$, so both outer bounds are equalities.

- **Nonnegativity, as a special case.** If $f \ge 0$ on $[a,b]$ then $m$ may be taken to be $0$, so $\int_a^b f \ge 0$ whenever the integral exists. A nonnegative integrand with vanishing integral need not vanish, however; that is [[fs-nonnegative-integrable-with-zero-integral-vanishes]].

## Statement

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a \le b$, let $(a_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ and
$(b_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ be sequences of reals with $a_k \le b_k$ for every
$k$, and suppose

$$[a,b] \;\subseteq\; \bigcup_{k \in \mathbb{N}} [a_k, b_k] .$$

If $M \in \mathbb{R}$ satisfies $\sum_{k < n} (b_k - a_k) \le M$ for every
$n \in \mathbb{N}$, then

$$M \;\ge\; b - a .$$

Consequently, if $a < b$ then **no subset of $\mathbb{R}$ containing $[a,b]$ has
measure zero** ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]); in particular none of
the four bounded intervals $[a,b]$, $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$, $(a,b]$ with $a < b$ has
measure zero, so measure zero is not a vacuous notion.

This is the countable strengthening of
[[lem-finite-interval-cover-total-length]], and it is what compactness is spent
on: the countable cover is enlarged to an open one at an arbitrarily small cost
in total length, and [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]] reduces it to a
finite cover, where the finite lemma applies.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a \le b$, sequences $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ with $a_k \le b_k$ for every $k$ and $[a,b] \subseteq \bigcup_k [a_k,b_k]$, and a real $M$ with $\sum_{k<n}(b_k - a_k) \le M$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Throughout, $\theta := 2^{-1}$.

[L1] Measure zero: $A$ is null when for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a sequence of closed intervals covering $A$ all of whose partial total lengths are $\le \varepsilon$; a subset of a null set is null ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

[L2] $[c,d] = \{\, x : c \le x \le d \,\}$ has length $d - c \ge 0$ when $c \le d$; $(c,d)$ is the open interval; a closed bounded interval is bounded ([[def-interval]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L3] Every open interval $(c,d)$ is an open set and every interval $[c,d]$ is a closed set ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L4] A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is compact exactly when it is closed and bounded ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]]); from every family of open sets whose union contains a compact set, either the set is empty and the empty subfamily covers it, or one can extract $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and members $U_0, \dots, U_m$ of the family whose union already contains it ([[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L5] If $[a,b] \subseteq \bigcup_{j \le n}[c_j,d_j]$ with $c_j \le d_j$ and $a \le b$, then $\sum_{j \le n}(d_j - c_j) \ge b - a$; the same holds for covering intervals of any bounded form with those endpoints ([[lem-finite-interval-cover-total-length]]).

[L6] Powers and the geometric series: $\theta^0 = 1$ and $\theta^{k+1} = \theta^k \theta$, all $\theta^k > 0$ for $\theta > 0$, and $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \theta^k = 1/(1-\theta) = 2$ for $\theta = 2^{-1}$; a series of nonnegative terms has all its partial sums at most its sum ([[def-integer-power]], [[thm-geometric-series]], [[def-series]], [[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]]).

[L7] Finite sums: additivity, scaling by a constant, splitting, and monotonicity in the terms ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L8] Every finite list $k_0, \dots, k_m$ of naturals has an upper bound $K \in \mathbb{N}$: by induction on $m$, taking $K = 0$ for the empty case and replacing $K$ by whichever of $K$ and $k_{m+1}$ is the larger, the order of $\mathbb{N}$ being total ([[thm-induction-principle]], [[lem-nat-trichotomy]], [[def-nat-order]]).

[L9] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 > 0$ and $0 < t \cdot 2^{-1} < t$ for $t > 0$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve an inequality; the order is total and transitive ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $M < b - a$. Since $\sum_{k<0}(b_k - a_k) = 0$ by [L7], we have $M \ge 0$, so $b - a > 0$ and $a < b$. Put $\varepsilon := (b - a - M) \cdot 2^{-1}$, a positive real by [L9]. [assume-contra, given, L7, L9]

2.1 For $k \in \mathbb{N}$ put $\delta_k := \varepsilon \cdot 4^{-1} \cdot \theta^{k}$, a positive real by [L6] and [L9], and $J_k := (a_k - \delta_k,\ b_k + \delta_k)$. Each $J_k$ is an open set by [L3], and $[a_k,b_k] \subseteq J_k$ because $a_k - \delta_k < a_k \le x \le b_k < b_k + \delta_k$ for $x \in [a_k,b_k]$, by [L2] and [L9]. Hence $[a,b] \subseteq \bigcup_k [a_k,b_k] \subseteq \bigcup_k J_k$, so $\{\, J_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\}$ is a family of open sets whose union contains $[a,b]$. The length of the interval with endpoints $a_k - \delta_k$ and $b_k + \delta_k$ is $(b_k - a_k) + 2\delta_k = (b_k - a_k) + \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} \cdot \theta^{k}$, by [L2] and [L9]. [step 1.1, given, L2, L3, L6, L9]

3.1 $[a,b]$ is closed and bounded by [L2] and [L3], hence compact by [L4]; so there are $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and members $J_{k_0}, \dots, J_{k_m}$ of the family with $[a,b] \subseteq J_{k_0} \cup \dots \cup J_{k_m}$. By [L8] fix $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $k_t \le K$ for every $t \le m$; then every $J_{k_t}$ occurs among $J_0, \dots, J_K$, so $[a,b] \subseteq \bigcup_{k \le K} J_k$. [step 2.1, L2, L3, L4, L8, choose]

4.1 By [L5], applied to the $K+1$ intervals $J_k$ with endpoints $a_k - \delta_k \le b_k + \delta_k$, one gets $\sum_{k \le K} \big( (b_k - a_k) + \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} \cdot \theta^{k} \big) \ge b - a$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L5]

5.1 The left-hand side is at most $M + \varepsilon$: by [L7] it splits as $\sum_{k < K+1}(b_k - a_k) + \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} \sum_{k < K+1} \theta^{k}$, the first sum is $\le M$ by hypothesis, and the second is $\le \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} \cdot 2 = \varepsilon$ by [L6]. So $b - a \le M + \varepsilon = (b - a + M) \cdot 2^{-1} < b - a$ by [L9], which is impossible; the assumption of step 1.1 is untenable and $M \ge b - a$. For the consequence, let $a < b$ and let $A \supseteq [a,b]$ be null; taking $\varepsilon_1 := (b-a) \cdot 2^{-1} > 0$ in [L1] gives a sequence of closed intervals covering $A$, hence covering $[a,b]$, with every partial total length $\le \varepsilon_1$, so what has just been proved gives $(b-a) \cdot 2^{-1} \ge b - a$ and hence $b - a \le 0$ by [L9], contradicting $a < b$. Finally each of $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$, $(a,b]$ and $[a,b]$ with $a < b$ contains $[a', b']$ for $a' := a + (b-a) \cdot 4^{-1}$ and $b' := b - (b-a) \cdot 4^{-1}$, which satisfy $a < a' < b' < b$ by [L9], so none of them is null. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 4.1, given, L1, L6, L7, L9, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the hypothesis $\sum_{k<n}(b_k - a_k) \le M$ says.** It is the working form of "the total length is at most $M$" recorded in [[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]: for nonnegative terms, having all partial sums below $M$ is the same as convergence with sum below $M$. Stating the lemma with partial sums avoids assuming convergence, and the conclusion is therefore also the statement that a cover of $[a,b]$ whose total length diverges is no counterexample.

- **The $\varepsilon$ is spent on making the cover open, not on the estimate.** Enlarging $[a_k,b_k]$ to $(a_k - \delta_k, b_k + \delta_k)$ adds $2\delta_k$ to the $k$-th length, and the geometric choice $\delta_k = \varepsilon \theta^k/4$ makes the whole added amount at most $\varepsilon$, however many intervals are used. This is the standard device and it recurs in [[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]].

- **Compactness is not optional here.** Without it the finite lemma cannot be reached, and the countable statement is genuinely stronger than the finite one: $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$ is covered by countably many intervals of total length below any $\varepsilon$, and by no finite family of total length below $1$ ([[cex-null-set-not-of-content-zero]]).

## Statement

Write $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the image of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$
under the canonical embedding $q \mapsto \hat q$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), the
set usually written $\mathbb{Q}$ once the identification is made, and put
$X := \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the irrationals. Then:

1. $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$, that is,
   $\overline{\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}} = \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]);
2. $X$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$;
3. every nonempty open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable
   ([[def-countable]]).

Claim 2 is not a symmetry of claim 1: the rationals are dense because they are
*constructed* to approximate, whereas the irrationals are dense because there are
too many points in any interval for a countable set to exhaust it, which is why
claim 3 is proved alongside and used for it.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The canonical embedding $q \mapsto \hat q$ of $\mathbb{Q}$ into $\mathbb{R}$, its image $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, and the complement $X = \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$.

[L1] $\overline{A}$ is the set of points every neighbourhood of which meets $A$; $A$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ when $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L2] $N_\varepsilon(x) = (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon)$ for real $\varepsilon > 0$, and $x - \varepsilon < x + \varepsilon$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L3] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L4] Strictly between any two reals lies an element of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, and $q \mapsto \hat q$ is injective ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L5] $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-rationals-countable]]); an injection is a bijection onto its image, and $\approx$ is symmetric and transitive ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]], [[def-equinumerous]]).

[L6] Every subset of an at most countable set is at most countable, and uncountable means not at most countable ([[lem-subset-of-countable]], [[def-countable]]).

[L7] For $a < b$ the interval $(a,b)$ is uncountable ([[cor-interval-uncountable]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is dense: let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real; by [L2] one has $x - \varepsilon < x + \varepsilon$, so [L4] supplies $\hat q$ with $x - \varepsilon < \hat q < x + \varepsilon$, that is $\hat q \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$. Every real is therefore an adherent point of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and claim 1 follows from [L1]. [L1, L2, L4]

1.2 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is at most countable: the embedding is an injection of $\mathbb{Q}$ with image $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, hence a bijection onto it, so $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \approx \mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$. [L4, L5]

1.3 For all reals $a < b$ the interval $(a,b)$ is uncountable. [L7]

2.1 For all reals $a < b$ the interval $(a,b)$ contains an irrational: if it did not, then $(a,b) \subseteq \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, so $(a,b)$ would be a subset of an at most countable set by step 1.2 and hence at most countable by [L6], contradicting step 1.3. So some $z \in (a,b)$ lies in $X$. [step 1.2, step 1.3, L6]

2.2 Every nonempty open $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is uncountable: fix $x \in U$ and, by [L3], a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; by [L2] the set $N_\varepsilon(x)$ is the interval $(x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon)$ with $x - \varepsilon < x + \varepsilon$, hence uncountable by step 1.3. Were $U$ at most countable, its subset $N_\varepsilon(x)$ would be at most countable by [L6], which it is not; so $U$ is uncountable, which is claim 3. [step 1.3, L2, L3, L6, choose]

3.1 $X$ is dense: let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real; applying step 2.1 with $a = x - \varepsilon$ and $b = x + \varepsilon$ gives $z \in (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon) \cap X$, which is $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap X$ by [L2]. Every real is therefore an adherent point of $X$, so $\overline{X} = \mathbb{R}$ by [L1], which is claim 2. [step 2.1, L1, L2]

4.1 Claims 1, 2 and 3 are steps 1.1, 3.1 and 2.2, so both $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and its complement are dense in $\mathbb{R}$ and every nonempty open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable. [step 1.1, step 2.2, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Two dense sets can be disjoint.** $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and $X$ partition
  $\mathbb{R}$ and both are dense, so density says nothing about size: one of
  them is countable and the other is not
  ([[cor-irrationals-uncountable]]). What density does say is that neither has
  interior: a set whose complement is dense has empty interior, which is the
  computation carried out for $\mathbb{Q}$ in
  [[ex-closure-interior-boundary-of-q]].

- **Claim 3 is a statement about open sets, not about intervals.** It follows
  from the uncountability of intervals ([[cor-interval-uncountable]]) only
  because openness supplies an interval inside the set at each of its points.
  A nonempty set with empty interior can perfectly well be countable, as
  $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ shows.

- **An explicit irrational is not produced here.** Step 2.1 is a counting
  argument and exhibits nothing. The library does exhibit one separately,
  $\sqrt 2$ ([[thm-of-square-roots]], [[fs-sqrt2-rational]]), and an explicit
  irrational in a given interval $(a,b)$ can be built from it as
  $q_1 + (q_2 - q_1)/\sqrt 2$ for suitable rationals $q_1 < q_2$ in the
  interval; that route is longer and is not the one taken above.

## Statement

Let $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ and $t$ be the Dirichlet and Thomae functions
([[def-dirichlet-and-thomae-functions]]), and write $q(x)$ for the least
denominator of a rational $x$, so that $t(x) = 1/\iota(q(x))$ there and
$t(x) = 0$ at every irrational $x$. Then:

1. $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ is continuous at **no** point of $\mathbb{R}$
   ([[def-continuity-real]]);
2. $\omega_{t}(c) = t(c)$ for **every** real $c$ ([[def-oscillation]]);
3. $t$ is continuous at every irrational and discontinuous at every rational, so
   its set of continuity points is exactly $\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$.

**Claim 1 restates, on this page, what
[[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]] already proves.** That item is homed on
the examples page of *Continuity, the intermediate and extreme value theorems,
and uniform continuity*, and an examples page is a leaf of this library: nothing
outside it may depend on an item that lives there. The claim is needed here, and
on later pages, as a citable statement, so it is proved again rather than
quoted. The two statements are the same statement, and neither is stronger than
the other; the proof below is the same argument, and no originality is claimed
for it. This is the pattern
[[ex-distance-to-the-integers-is-1-lipschitz]] follows.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The Dirichlet function $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ and Thomae's function $t$, and a real $c$; $\mathbb{N} \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ are the canonical copies and $\iota(q) = q \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$.

[A1] $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(x) = 1$ for $x \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $0$ otherwise; $t(x) = 1/\iota(q(x)) \in (0,1]$ for $x \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $t(x) = 0$ otherwise, where $q(x) = \min\{q \ge 1 : \iota(q)x \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ ([[def-dirichlet-and-thomae-functions]]).

[L1] Both $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$ are dense in $\mathbb{R}$, so every $N_\delta(y)$ contains a rational and an irrational ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L2] For every real $x$ there is exactly one integer $m$ with $m \le x < m+1$, written $\lfloor x \rfloor$ ([[lem-integer-part]]); consequently no integer lies strictly between two consecutive integers.

[L3] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N) < \eta$; and $\iota$ is positive and strictly increasing on the naturals $\ge 1$, so $1 \le q \le N$ gives $\iota(q) \le \iota(N)$ and $1/\iota(N) \le 1/\iota(q)$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L4] A nonempty finite set of reals presented as $\{a_{0}, \dots, a_{n}\}$ has a minimum ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L5] $\omega_{f}(S) = \sup\{|f(x)-f(y)| : x,y \in S\}$ and $\omega_{f}(c) = \inf\{\omega_{f}(N_\delta(c)) : \delta > 0\}$ for $f$ defined on all of $\mathbb{R}$, both computed in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, where every set has a supremum and an infimum; $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if $\omega_{f}(c) = 0$ ([[def-oscillation]], [[def-extended-reals]], [[lem-extended-reals-complete]], [[thm-continuity-iff-oscillation-zero]]).

[L6] $|u| \ge 0$, $|u - v| \le |u| + |v|$, and if $0 \le u \le M$ and $0 \le v \le M$ then $|u - v| \le M$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Claim 1. Let $c$ be real and let $\delta > 0$ be real. The neighbourhood $N_\delta(c)$ contains a rational $u$ and an irrational $v$, and $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(u) - \mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(v) = 1 - 0 = 1$; since $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(c)$ is $0$ or $1$, one of $|\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(u) - \mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(c)|$ and $|\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(v) - \mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(c)|$ equals $1$. So the continuity condition at $c$ fails for $\varepsilon = 1$, no $\delta$ witnessing it, and $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ is continuous at no point. [A1, L1]

1.2 **A separation estimate.** For a real $c$ and a natural $q \ge 1$ put $m := \lfloor \iota(q)c \rfloor$ and define $d_{q}(c) := 1/\iota(q)$ if $\iota(q)c = m$, and $d_{q}(c) := \min\{\iota(q)c - m,\ m + 1 - \iota(q)c\}/\iota(q)$ otherwise. In both cases $d_{q}(c) > 0$. [L2, L3, construct]

1.3 **A lower bound.** For every real $\delta > 0$ the neighbourhood $N_\delta(c)$ contains an irrational $v$, and $c \in N_\delta(c)$, so $\omega_{t}(N_\delta(c)) \ge |t(c) - t(v)| = t(c)$; taking the infimum over $\delta$ gives $\omega_{t}(c) \ge t(c)$. [A1, L1, L5]

2.1 With $d_{q}(c)$ as in step 1.2: for every integer $p$ with $p/\iota(q) \ne c$ one has $|c - p/\iota(q)| \ge d_{q}(c)$. If $\iota(q)c = m$ then $p \ne m$, so $|\iota(q)c - p| = |m - p| \ge 1$; otherwise $m < \iota(q)c < m+1$, and $p \le m$ gives $\iota(q)c - p \ge \iota(q)c - m$ while $p \ge m+1$ gives $p - \iota(q)c \ge m+1-\iota(q)c$. Dividing by $\iota(q) > 0$ gives the claim. [step 1.2, L2, L3]

2.2 For a real $c$ and a natural $N \ge 1$ put $\delta_{N}(c) := \min\{d_{1}(c), \dots, d_{N}(c)\}$, the minimum of a nonempty finite set of positive reals, so $\delta_{N}(c) > 0$. [step 1.2, L4, construct]

3.1 If $x$ is rational with $0 < |x - c| < \delta_{N}(c)$ then $q(x) > N$ and hence $t(x) < 1/\iota(N)$. Indeed $x = p/\iota(q)$ with $q := q(x)$ and $p := \iota(q)x$; if $q \le N$ then $p/\iota(q) = x \ne c$, so step 2.1 gives $|c - x| \ge d_{q}(c) \ge \delta_{N}(c)$, contrary to the hypothesis. So $q(x) > N$, and $t(x) = 1/\iota(q(x)) < 1/\iota(N)$ because $\iota$ is strictly increasing. [step 2.1, step 2.2, A1, L3]

4.1 **An upper bound for $t$ near $c$.** Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real, take $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N) < \varepsilon$ and put $\delta := \delta_{N}(c)$. Every $x \in N_\delta(c)$ satisfies $0 \le t(x) \le M$ where $M := \max\{t(c), \varepsilon\}$: for $x = c$ this is $t(c) \le M$; for $x \ne c$ rational it is $t(x) < 1/\iota(N) < \varepsilon \le M$ by step 3.1; and for $x$ irrational it is $t(x) = 0$. [step 3.1, A1, L3, L6]

5.1 Hence $\omega_{t}(N_\delta(c)) \le M$ with $\delta$ and $M$ as in step 4.1, since $|t(x) - t(y)| \le M$ for all $x, y \in N_\delta(c)$, so $M$ is an upper bound of the set whose supremum $\omega_{t}(N_\delta(c))$ is; and therefore $\omega_{t}(c) \le M = \max\{t(c), \varepsilon\}$. [step 4.1, L5, L6]

6.1 Claim 2 now follows in the two cases of the value $t(c)$, which are exactly the two cases of the position of $c$. If $c$ is rational then $t(c) > 0$, and applying step 5.1 with the admissible choice $\varepsilon := t(c)$ gives $\omega_{t}(c) \le \max\{t(c), t(c)\} = t(c)$; with step 1.3 this gives $\omega_{t}(c) = t(c)$. [step 5.1, step 1.3, A1, assume-case rat]

6.2 If $c$ is irrational then $t(c) = 0$, and step 5.1 gives $\omega_{t}(c) \le \max\{0, \varepsilon\} = \varepsilon$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$; since also $\omega_{t}(c) \ge 0$, an extended real that is $\le \varepsilon$ for every positive real $\varepsilon$ and $\ge 0$ must be $0$, so $\omega_{t}(c) = 0 = t(c)$. [step 5.1, step 1.3, A1, L5, assume-case irr]

7.1 Every real is rational or irrational and not both, so steps 6.1 and 6.2 establish claim 2 for every real $c$. [step 6.1, step 6.2, cases-exhaustive]

8.1 Claim 3 follows from claim 2: $t$ is continuous at $c$ exactly when $\omega_{t}(c) = 0$, that is exactly when $t(c) = 0$, that is exactly when $c$ is irrational. So the continuity set of $t$ is $\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$ and its discontinuity set is $\mathbb{Q}$. [step 7.1, A1, L5] ∎

## Remarks

- **What claim 2 adds beyond claim 3.** Continuity at a point is the vanishing of the oscillation there, so claim 3 is the special case of claim 2 recording where the value is $0$. The value itself is used on the companion page, where the oscillation of $t$ is computed at particular points, and it shows that the failure of continuity at a rational is exactly as large as the value of $t$ there: small denominators are the bad points.

- **The continuity set of $t$ is $G_\delta$, as it must be.** The irrationals form a $G_\delta$ set ([[cor-q-is-meager-and-not-g-delta]]), in agreement with [[thm-discontinuity-set-is-f-sigma]]. The reverse arrangement is impossible: no function is continuous at every rational and discontinuous at every irrational, because $\mathbb{Q}$ is not $G_\delta$ ([[cor-no-function-is-continuous-exactly-on-q]]).

- **No choice principle is spent.** The separation estimate of step 1.2 is written down from $\lfloor \iota(q)c \rfloor$, the minimum of step 2.1 is the minimum of an explicitly listed finite set, and the least denominator $q(x)$ is a least element. Density supplies points, and it is used only in the form "every neighbourhood meets the set", never to build a sequence.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]) and let

$$D \;:=\; \{\, x \in [a,b] \ : \ f \text{ is discontinuous at } x \,\}$$

([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-classification-of-discontinuities]]). Then

$$f \text{ is Riemann integrable on } [a,b] \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad D \text{ has measure zero}$$

([[def-darboux-integral]], [[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

**The choice cost, named.** The implication from integrability to $D$ being null
uses the Axiom of Countable Choice ([[def-countable-choice]]) exactly once,
through [[thm-countable-union-of-null-is-null]] at step 7.1: $D$ is exhibited as
the union of a sequence of null sets. The converse implication, from $D$ null to
integrability, is a theorem of ZF: it uses no choice principle at all.

**"Measure zero" here is the cover condition of
[[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]**, namely that for every $\varepsilon > 0$
there is a sequence of intervals covering $D$ of total length at most
$\varepsilon$. No outer measure, no measurable set and no Lebesgue integral is
used or needed; the criterion is a statement about interval covers throughout.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, a bounded $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $M_{+} > 0$ with $|f(x)| \le M_{+}$ for every $x \in [a,b]$, and $D$ as in the Statement.

[A1] The Axiom of Countable Choice, used only where [L11] is invoked ([[def-countable-choice]]).

[L1] For a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[a,b]$: $n \ge 1$, $\Delta_i = t_{i+1}-t_i > 0$, $\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = b-a$, $I_i = [t_i,t_{i+1}] \subseteq [a,b]$, and appending a point $y > t_n$ to a partition of $[a,t_n]$ gives a partition of $[a,y]$ whose subintervals are the old ones together with $[t_n,y]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L2] $U(f,P) - L(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}(M_i-m_i)\Delta_i$, $M_i - m_i = \omega_f(I_i)$, and $0 \le M_i - m_i \le 2M_{+}$ ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-oscillation]]).

[L3] Riemann's criterion: a bounded $f$ is integrable if and only if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a partition $P$ with $U(f,P)-L(f,P) < \varepsilon$ ([[thm-riemann-criterion]]).

[L4] Oscillation: $\omega_f(S) \le \omega_f(T)$ for $S \subseteq T \subseteq [a,b]$; $0 \le \omega_f(x) \le \omega_f([a,b] \cap N_\rho(x))$ for every real $\rho > 0$ and every $x \in [a,b]$; $\omega_f(x)$ is the infimum of those values over $\rho > 0$; and since $f$ is bounded every one of these values is a real number in $[0, 2M_{+}]$ ([[def-oscillation]], [[def-extended-reals]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L5] $f$ is continuous at $x \in [a,b]$ if and only if $\omega_f(x) = 0$; hence $D = \{x \in [a,b] : \omega_f(x) > 0\}$ ([[thm-continuity-iff-oscillation-zero]], [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L6] For every real $\sigma > 0$ there is a closed $G \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ with $\{x \in [a,b] : \omega_f(x) \ge \sigma\} = [a,b] \cap G$ ([[lem-oscillation-superlevel-sets-are-closed]]).

[L7] A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is compact exactly when it is closed and bounded; $[a,b]$ is closed and bounded; an intersection of closed sets is closed; every open interval is an open set ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], [[def-interval]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L8] $A$ has content zero when for every real $\tau > 0$ there are $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and reals $c_0 \le e_0, \dots, c_m \le e_m$ with $A \subseteq \bigcup_{j \le m}[c_j,e_j]$ and $\sum_{j \le m}(e_j - c_j) \le \tau$; $A$ has measure zero when the same holds with a sequence of intervals and every partial total length at most $\tau$; a subset of a null set is null ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

[L9] A set of content zero has measure zero ([[lem-content-zero-implies-null]]), and for a **compact** set the two notions coincide ([[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]]).

[L10] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $k \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(k) < \eta$; $\iota(k) > 0$ for $k \ge 1$, $\iota$ is nonnegative and nondecreasing on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L11] Assuming [A1], the union of a sequence of null subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ is null ([[thm-countable-union-of-null-is-null]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L12] Finite sums: splitting, additivity, scaling, monotonicity in the terms, and telescoping ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]). Also the interchange of two finite sums, $\sum_{i<n}\sum_{j<p}c_{i,j} = \sum_{j<p}\sum_{i<n}c_{i,j}$ for any doubly indexed family of reals; below it is applied with $p := m+1$, since $\sum_{j \le m}$ abbreviates $\sum_{j<m+1}$. That identity is **not** one of the six clauses of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] and is therefore proved here, by induction on $p$ with $n$ held fixed ([[thm-induction-principle]]). At $p = 0$ each inner sum $\sum_{j<0}c_{i,j}$ is $0$ by the recursion clause of [[def-finite-sum]], so the left side is $\sum_{i<n}0 = 0$ by clause 2 of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] taken with $\lambda = 0$, while the right side is an empty sum and so is $0$ as well. Passing from $p$ to $p+1$, the recursion clause and clause 1 of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] give $\sum_{i<n}\sum_{j<p+1}c_{i,j} = \sum_{i<n}\bigl(\sum_{j<p}c_{i,j} + c_{i,p}\bigr) = \sum_{i<n}\sum_{j<p}c_{i,j} + \sum_{i<n}c_{i,p}$, which by the induction hypothesis is $\sum_{j<p}\sum_{i<n}c_{i,j} + \sum_{i<n}c_{i,p} = \sum_{j<p+1}\sum_{i<n}c_{i,j}$, again by the recursion clause.

[L13] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]); every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ bounded above has a supremum ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L14] Ordered-field arithmetic and the absolute value: adding a constant and multiplying by a positive quantity preserve an inequality; the order is total and transitive; an open interval is order-convex ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-interval]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For a real $\sigma > 0$ put $E_\sigma := \{\, x \in [a,b] : \omega_f(x) \ge \sigma \,\}$. By [L5], $E_\sigma \subseteq D$ for every $\sigma > 0$. [L4, L5, construct]

2.1 **Each $E_\sigma$ has content zero, assuming $f$ integrable.** Let $\sigma > 0$ and $\tau > 0$ be real. By [L3] fix a partition $P = (n,t)$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \sigma\tau \cdot 2^{-1}$. Let $B := \{\, i < n : (t_i,t_{i+1}) \cap E_\sigma \ne \varnothing \,\}$ and put $\chi_i := 1$ for $i \in B$ and $\chi_i := 0$ otherwise. [step 1.1, L3, L14, choose, construct]

2.2 **The exhaustion of $D$.** Put $\sigma_k := 1/\iota(k+1)$ for $k \in \mathbb{N}$, a positive real by [L10]. Then $D = \bigcup_{k \in \mathbb{N}} E_{\sigma_k}$. For the inclusion from left to right, let $x \in D$, so $\omega_f(x) > 0$ by [L5] and $\omega_f(x)$ is a real by [L4]; if $\omega_f(x) \ge 1 = \sigma_0$ then $x \in E_{\sigma_0}$, and otherwise [L10] gives a natural $k+1 \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(k+1) < \omega_f(x)$, so $x \in E_{\sigma_k}$. For the reverse inclusion, $x \in E_{\sigma_k}$ gives $\omega_f(x) \ge \sigma_k > 0$, hence $x \in D$ by [L5]. [step 1.1, L4, L5, L10, L14]

2.3 **The converse; this half of the proof is steps 2.3, 3.2, 4.2, 5.2, 6.2, 7.2, 8.1, 9.1, 10.1, 11.1, 12.1 and 13.1, and its symbols are its own.** Assume $D$ null and let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. Put $\sigma' := \varepsilon \cdot \bigl(2(b-a)\bigr)^{-1}$ and $\tau' := \varepsilon \cdot \bigl(8M_{+}\bigr)^{-1}$, both positive by [L14]. By step 1.1 and [L8], $E_{\sigma'} \subseteq D$ is null. [step 1.1, given, L8, L14]

3.1 For $i \in B$ one has $M_i - m_i \ge \sigma$: fix $x \in (t_i,t_{i+1}) \cap E_\sigma$; since $(t_i,t_{i+1})$ is open there is a real $\rho > 0$ with $N_\rho(x) \subseteq (t_i,t_{i+1})$, so $[a,b] \cap N_\rho(x) \subseteq I_i$ and [L4] gives $\sigma \le \omega_f(x) \le \omega_f([a,b] \cap N_\rho(x)) \le \omega_f(I_i) = M_i - m_i$ by [L2]. [step 2.1, L1, L2, L4, L7, choose]

3.2 $E_{\sigma'}$ is compact: by [L6] there is a closed $G$ with $E_{\sigma'} = [a,b] \cap G$, an intersection of two closed sets, hence closed; and $E_{\sigma'} \subseteq [a,b]$ is bounded. So [L7] applies. [step 2.3, L6, L7]

4.1 Hence $\sigma\chi_i\Delta_i \le (M_i - m_i)\Delta_i$ for every $i < n$, the case $i \notin B$ because both $M_i - m_i \ge 0$ and $\Delta_i > 0$. Summing and using [L12] and [L2]: $\sigma \sum_{i<n}\chi_i\Delta_i \le U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \sigma\tau \cdot 2^{-1}$, so $\lambda := \sum_{i<n}\chi_i\Delta_i < \tau \cdot 2^{-1}$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L2, L12, L14]

4.2 By [L9] applied to the compact null set $E_{\sigma'}$, it has content zero, so by [L8] there are $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and reals $c_0 \le e_0, \dots, c_m \le e_m$ with $E_{\sigma'} \subseteq \bigcup_{j \le m}[c_j,e_j]$ and $\sum_{j\le m}(e_j-c_j) \le \tau' \cdot 2^{-1}$. Put $\mu := \tau' \cdot \bigl(4(\iota(m)+1)\bigr)^{-1} > 0$ and $O_j := (c_j - \mu,\ e_j + \mu)$, an open interval containing $[c_j,e_j]$, of length $(e_j - c_j) + 2\mu$. Then $\sum_{j\le m}\bigl((e_j-c_j)+2\mu\bigr) \le \tau' \cdot 2^{-1} + 2\mu(\iota(m)+1) = \tau' \cdot 2^{-1} + \tau' \cdot 2^{-1} = \tau'$, by [L12] and [L10]. [step 2.3, step 3.2, L8, L9, L10, L12, L14, construct]

5.1 $E_\sigma$ is covered by the finite list of $2n+1$ closed intervals $[p_j,q_j]$, $j \le 2n$, defined by $[p_j,q_j] := [t_j,t_{j+1}]$ for $j < n$ with $j \in B$, $[p_j,q_j] := [a,a]$ for $j < n$ with $j \notin B$, and $[p_j,q_j] := [t_{j-n},t_{j-n}]$ for $n \le j \le 2n$: indeed a point of $E_\sigma$ lies in $[a,b]$, hence is one of $t_0,\dots,t_n$ or lies in some $(t_i,t_{i+1})$, and in the latter case $i \in B$. Its total length is $\sum_{j \le 2n}(q_j - p_j) = \sum_{i<n}\chi_i\Delta_i + 0 = \lambda < \tau$, by splitting the sum at $n$ ([L12]). [step 2.1, step 4.1, L1, L12, L14, construct]

5.2 **The family of good intervals.** Let $\mathcal{W}$ be the set of all open intervals $(u,v)$ with $u < v$ such that either $(u,v) \subseteq O_j$ for some $j \le m$, or $\omega_f([a,b]\cap(u,v)) < \sigma'$. Every $x \in [a,b]$ lies in a member: if $x \in E_{\sigma'}$ then $x \in [c_j,e_j] \subseteq O_j$ for some $j \le m$ by step 4.2, and $O_j$ is itself a member; and if $x \notin E_{\sigma'}$ then $\omega_f(x) < \sigma'$, so by [L4] some real $\rho > 0$ has $\omega_f([a,b]\cap N_\rho(x)) < \sigma'$, and $N_\rho(x) = (x-\rho,x+\rho)$ is a member containing $x$. [step 4.2, L4, L7, L14, construct]

6.1 As $\tau > 0$ was arbitrary, $E_\sigma$ has content zero by [L8], hence measure zero by [L9]; this used only that $f$ is integrable. [step 2.1, step 5.1, L8, L9]

6.2 **Cousin's construction: a partition each of whose subintervals lies in a member of $\mathcal{W}$.** Let $S$ be the set of $y \in (a,b]$ such that some partition of $[a,y]$ has every subinterval contained in a member of $\mathcal{W}$. $S$ is nonempty: by step 5.2 fix $(\alpha,\beta) \in \mathcal{W}$ with $a \in (\alpha,\beta)$ and put $y_0 := \min\{(a+b)\cdot 2^{-1},\ (a+\beta)\cdot 2^{-1}\}$, so $a < y_0 \le b$, $y_0 < \beta$ and $\alpha < a$; the one-subinterval partition of $[a,y_0]$ has $[a,y_0] \subseteq (\alpha,\beta)$, so $y_0 \in S$. Also $S$ is bounded above by $b$, so $s := \sup S$ exists by [L13] and $a < y_0 \le s \le b$. [step 5.2, L1, L13, L14, choose]

7.1 **Integrability implies $D$ null.** Assume $f$ integrable. By step 6.1 each $E_{\sigma_k}$ is null, and $k \mapsto E_{\sigma_k}$ is a sequence of subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, so [L11] applies and $\bigcup_k E_{\sigma_k} = D$ is null by step 2.2. This is the only use of [A1] in the proof. [step 6.1, step 2.2, A1, L11]

7.2 $s = b$. By step 5.2 fix $(\alpha',\beta') \in \mathcal{W}$ with $s \in (\alpha',\beta')$. Since $\sup S = s > \alpha'$ there is $x \in S$ with $x > \alpha'$, and $x \le s$. Suppose $s < b$ and choose a real $y$ with $s < y < \min\{b, \beta'\}$, possible because $s < b$ and $s < \beta'$. Then $\alpha' < x \le s < y < \beta'$, so $[x,y] \subseteq (\alpha',\beta')$, and appending $y$ to a partition of $[a,x]$ witnessing $x \in S$ gives one for $[a,y]$ by [L1]; hence $y \in S$ with $y > \sup S$, which is impossible. [step 6.2, L1, L13, L14, choose]

8.1 $b \in S$. By step 5.2 fix $(\alpha'',\beta'') \in \mathcal{W}$ with $b \in (\alpha'',\beta'')$. Since $\sup S = b > \alpha''$ there is $x \in S$ with $x > \alpha''$ and $x \le b$. If $x = b$ there is nothing to prove; otherwise $\alpha'' < x < b < \beta''$ gives $[x,b] \subseteq (\alpha'',\beta'')$, and appending $b$ as in step 7.2 puts $b$ in $S$. So there is a partition $P' = (n',t')$ of $[a,b]$, with subintervals $I'_i$ and lengths $\Delta'_i$ for $i < n'$, every subinterval of which lies in a member of $\mathcal{W}$. [step 5.2, step 7.2, L1, L13, L14, choose]

9.1 **Good and bad subintervals.** Write $M'_i := \sup f[I'_i]$ and $m'_i := \inf f[I'_i]$. Call $i < n'$ **good** when $I'_i \subseteq W$ for some $W = (u,v) \in \mathcal{W}$ with $\omega_f([a,b]\cap(u,v)) < \sigma'$, and **bad** otherwise. For a good $i$, $I'_i \subseteq [a,b] \cap W$, so $M'_i - m'_i = \omega_f(I'_i) \le \omega_f([a,b]\cap W) < \sigma'$ by [L2] and [L4]. For a bad $i$, step 8.1 supplies a member containing $I'_i$, and it is not of the second kind, so $I'_i \subseteq O_j$ for some $j \le m$. [step 8.1, L1, L2, L4]

10.1 **Bounding the bad lengths.** For $j \le m$ put $J_j := \{\, i < n' : c_j - \mu \le t'_i \text{ and } t'_{i+1} \le e_j + \mu \,\}$ and $h^{j}_i := \Delta'_i$ for $i \in J_j$, $h^{j}_i := 0$ otherwise; a bad $i$ lies in some $J_j$ by step 9.1. Each $J_j$ consists of consecutive indices, since $i < i^{\dagger} < i^{\ddagger}$ with $i,i^{\ddagger} \in J_j$ gives $c_j - \mu \le t'_i \le t'_{i^{\dagger}}$ and $t'_{i^{\dagger}+1} \le t'_{i^{\ddagger}+1} \le e_j + \mu$. [step 9.1, L1, L14, construct]

11.1 $\sum_{i<n'}h^{j}_i \le (e_j - c_j) + 2\mu$ for each $j \le m$: the sum is $0$ when $J_j = \varnothing$; otherwise let $p := \min J_j$ and let $q$ be the least natural with $q > p$ and $q \notin J_j$, which exists by [L13] since $n' \notin J_j$, so that $J_j = \{\, i : p \le i < q \,\}$ by step 10.1. Splitting the sum at $p$ and at $q$ and discarding the vanishing outer parts, then telescoping ([L12]), gives $\sum_{i<n'}h^{j}_i = \sum_{i=p}^{q-1}\Delta'_i = t'_q - t'_p \le (e_j+\mu) - (c_j-\mu)$, using $p \in J_j$ and $q-1 \in J_j$. [step 10.1, L12, L13, L14]

12.1 Put $\beta_i := \Delta'_i$ for bad $i$ and $\beta_i := 0$ for good $i$. Then $\beta_i \le \sum_{j \le m}h^{j}_i$ pointwise by step 10.1, all terms being nonnegative, so by [L12] and step 11.1, $\sum_{i<n'}\beta_i \le \sum_{j\le m}\sum_{i<n'}h^{j}_i \le \sum_{j\le m}\bigl((e_j-c_j)+2\mu\bigr) \le \tau'$, the last step by step 4.2. [step 4.2, step 10.1, step 11.1, L12, L14]

13.1 For every $i < n'$, $(M'_i-m'_i)\Delta'_i \le \sigma'\Delta'_i + 2M_{+}\beta_i$: for good $i$ by step 9.1 and $\beta_i \ge 0$, for bad $i$ by $M'_i - m'_i \le 2M_{+}$ from [L2] and $\beta_i = \Delta'_i$. Summing over $i < n'$ and using [L12], [L1] and step 12.1: $U(f,P')-L(f,P') \le \sigma'(b-a) + 2M_{+}\tau' = \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1} + \varepsilon \cdot 4^{-1} < \varepsilon$. [step 2.3, step 9.1, step 12.1, L1, L2, L12, L14]

14.1 The real $\varepsilon > 0$ of step 2.3 was arbitrary and step 13.1 produced a partition with $U - L < \varepsilon$, so $f$ is integrable by [L3]. With step 7.1 this proves both implications, and the criterion is established; the forward half is steps 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1, 6.1 and 7.1, working with $\sigma, \tau, P, B, \chi, \lambda$, and the converse half is the steps named in step 2.3, working with $\sigma', \tau', P', \mathcal{W}, S$. [step 7.1, step 2.3, step 13.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the two halves cost.** The forward half is a single application of Riemann's criterion for each threshold $\sigma$, plus the countable union; the backward half is where all the work is, and it is entirely a covering argument: the bad set is compact and null, hence of content zero, hence coverable by finitely many open intervals of small total length, and the rest of $[a,b]$ is chopped up by Cousin's construction into pieces of oscillation below $\sigma$.

- **Why Cousin's construction and not a Lebesgue number.** Step 6.2 to step 8.1 build the partition directly from the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$: the set of right endpoints reachable by a good partition is nonempty and bounded, and its supremum is shown to be $b$ and to be attained. This uses no sequence, no subsequence and no choice, whereas the usual Lebesgue-number argument selects a bad interval for each $n$ and then extracts a convergent subsequence, which costs countable choice. Since the whole point of this item's choice ledger is that the backward implication is a ZF theorem, the choice-free route is the one taken.

- **The superlevel sets, not the discontinuity set, are what is covered.** $D$ itself is in general not closed, so [[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]] does not apply to it; each $E_\sigma$ **is** closed in $[a,b]$ ([[lem-oscillation-superlevel-sets-are-closed]]) and bounded, and that is exactly the hypothesis needed. The passage back from the $E_{\sigma_k}$ to $D$ is step 2.2, and it is where the countable union appears.

- **The exhaustion $D = \bigcup_k E_{1/\iota(k+1)}$ is derived here, and it is also claim 1 of [[thm-discontinuity-set-is-f-sigma]].** When this proof was written that theorem stated only the descriptive form — $D$ as the trace on the domain of an $F_\sigma$ subset of $\mathbb{R}$ — which is not the pointwise identity step 2.2 needs, so the identity was derived inline from [[thm-continuity-iff-oscillation-zero]] and the Archimedean property. The exhaustion has since been stated there as claim 1, precisely because several items were quoting it from a theorem that did not assert it. The inline derivation is retained because it is three lines and keeps this item's choice ledger readable in one place; citing claim 1 instead would be equally correct.

- **Both directions are sharp in the obvious sense.** The indicator of the Cantor set is discontinuous on an uncountable null set and is integrable; the indicator of the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set is discontinuous on a nowhere dense set that is not null and is not integrable ([[fs-integrability-is-equivalent-to-a-nowhere-dense-discontinuity-set]]). So neither cardinality nor category decides integrability; only measure does.
