You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as
an independent adversarial proof-refuter. Return evidence only; Audit-Alpha
alone adjudicates and edits.

## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` Statement or counterexample, actively search for a
counterexample to the public claim or a failure in the witness. A false public
claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or materially
inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is nonfatal.

Return no more than 450 words, exactly in this shape:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

For each defect:

```text
FINDING 1
  location: [exact section/fact/step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [exact assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]
```

Always end with:

```text
BOUNDARY: [specific boundary/counterexample checks and disposition]
SOURCES:  [confirm every supplied cited item used by the target was inspected]
CHECKED:  [confirm title, public claim, every numbered step, and Remarks]
```

## Example

For $k\in\mathbb N$, the function $f_k(x)=x^k|x|$ is $C^k$ on $\mathbb R$ but not $C^{k+1}$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $f_k(x)=x^k|x|$.

[L1] Absolute value is piecewise $x$ and $-x$ ([[def-abs-value]]), and powers differentiate by [[lem-derivative-of-a-power]].

## Verification

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 On $x>0$, $f_k=x^{k+1}$; on $x<0$, $f_k=-x^{k+1}$.  [assume-case positive, L1]

2.1 Differentiating $j\le k$ times gives constant multiples of $x^{k+1-j}$ with opposite signs, and both one-sided values tend to $0$. Defining the derivative value at $0$ by the difference quotient gives matching continuous derivatives through order $k$.  [step 1.1, assume-case throughk, L1]

2.2 The $(k+1)$-st one-sided derivatives are $(k+1)!$ and $-(k+1)!$, so that derivative does not exist at $0$.  [assume-case nextorder, step 1.1, L1]

3.1 Hence $f_k\in C^k\setminus C^{k+1}$ according to [[def-higher-derivatives-and-smoothness]].  [step 2.1, step 2.2, cases-exhaustive] ∎

## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]). The **absolute value** of
$x \in F$ is

$$|x| \;:=\; \begin{cases} x & \text{if } x \ge 0, \\ -x & \text{if } x < 0. \end{cases}$$

## Remarks

- The distance between $x$ and $y$ is $|x - y|$.
- The basic algebraic properties ($|x| \ge 0$, $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$,
  $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$, and the characterisation $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$) are
  established in [[lem-of-abs-value]]; the triangle inequality is
  [[lem-of-triangle-inequality]].

## Definition

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]) with additive identity $0_F$ and
multiplicative identity $1_F$. Define
$\iota : \mathbb{N} \to F$ by recursion on $\mathbb{N}$
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[thm-recursion]]):

$$\iota(0) \;:=\; 0_F, \qquad \iota(n+1) \;:=\; \iota(n) + 1_F .$$

$\iota(n)$ is the **canonical natural** of $n$ in $F$. It is also written
$n \cdot 1_F$, and for $n \ge 1$ it is $1_F$ added to itself $n$ times.

**Why the notation is needed at all.** A natural number in this library is a von
Neumann natural, that is a set ([[def-natural-numbers]]), and a set is not an
element of $F$. So $1/n$, $n^{\alpha}$ and $x/n$ are not expressions of $F$ when
$n$ is a natural: what they mean is $1/\iota(n)$, $\iota(n)^{\alpha}$ and
$x/\iota(n)$. The map $\iota$ is what carries a counting number into the field,
and writing it is the whole reason a reader meets $1/\iota(k+1)$ where an
informal text would write $1/(k+1)$.

## Remarks

- **Where the index shift comes from.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
  ([[def-natural-numbers]]) and $\iota(0) = 0_F$, so $1/\iota(k)$ is undefined at
  $k = 0$. A family of reciprocals indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ is therefore written
  over $\iota(k+1)$, which is why the harmonic and telescoping families of this
  library run over $k+1$ rather than over $k$. This is bookkeeping, not a
  restriction: the values are the usual ones.

- **This definition records notation; the arithmetic is proved elsewhere.** That
  $\iota$ is strictly increasing and positive on $n \ge 1$, and that it carries
  sums to sums and products to products, is [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], stated
  for an ordered field. That lemma introduces the same element by the equivalent
  recursion $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, which
  agrees with the definition above because $\iota(1) = \iota(0) + 1_F = 1_F$.
  Nothing here is new mathematics; the definition exists so that the notation has
  a home a reader can look up.

- **The symbol $\iota$ is used in this library for other canonical maps, and this
  definition does not govern them.** It also denotes the canonical field
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to F$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), the isometric
  embedding of a metric space into a completion ([[def-metric-completion]]), and
  an inclusion map $\iota : S \to X$ of a subspace. Each of those is introduced
  where it is used and means something different from the map defined here. What
  the four share is only that each is the canonical map of its situation.

- **Fields, not just ordered fields.** The recursion needs no order, so the
  definition is stated for a field; every use in this library is in an ordered
  field, and the order is what makes $\iota$ injective
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). In a field of positive characteristic $\iota$
  is not injective, which is one reason the injectivity is a lemma rather than
  part of the definition.

## Definition

Let $I\subseteq\mathbb R$ be an interval and $f:I\to\mathbb R$. Put $f^{(0)}:=f$. Recursively, wherever $f^{(j)}$ is differentiable, put $f^{(j+1)}:=(f^{(j)})'$, with derivatives at endpoints understood in the one-sided sense fixed by [[def-derivative]] and [[def-one-sided-limits]].

For $k\in\mathbb N$, the function is **$k$-times differentiable** on $I$ if $f^{(j)}$ exists on $I$ for every $j\le k$. It is of class **$C^k$** on $I$ if these derivatives exist and every $f^{(j)}$, $0\le j\le k$, is continuous on $I$ ([[def-continuity-real]]). It is **smooth**, or $C^\infty$, if it is $C^k$ for every $k\in\mathbb N$.

Since $0\in\mathbb N$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]), $C^0$ means continuity. The definitions also give $C^{k+1}\subseteq C^k$. Existence of $f^{(k)}$ alone does not assert that $f^{(k)}$ is continuous.

## Definition

Let $a \in \mathbb{R}$, where $\mathbb{R}$ is the ambient ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]).

**Natural exponents.** By the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) applied to
the set $\mathbb{R}$, the starting element $1$ and the function
$f(x) = x \cdot a$, there is a unique function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$,
written $n \mapsto a^n$, with

$$a^0 = 1, \qquad a^{n+1} = a^n \cdot a \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Thus $a^1 = a$, $a^2 = a \cdot a$, and so on. Note that this is defined for
**every** $a$, including $a = 0$.

**Negative exponents.** If $a \ne 0$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, set

$$a^{-n} := (a^n)^{-1}.$$

**Why that is legitimate.** The right-hand side presupposes that $a^n$ is
invertible, that is, that $a^n \ne 0$. This is a proof obligation and not an
observation, and it is discharged by claim 2 of [[lem-power-laws]]: for $a \ne 0$
in a field, $a^n \ne 0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, proved there by induction on
$n$ from the fact that a field has no zero divisors ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]).
That lemma is a statement *about* the operation introduced here, so it depends on
this definition and is recorded in this item's `justified_by` rather than in its
`deps` (SCHEMA §3). Given $a^n \ne 0$, the value $(a^n)^{-1}$ is a single
well-determined element, because multiplicative inverses in a field are unique
([[lem-of-inverse-unique]]).

**Integer exponents.** Every integer $m$ ([[def-integers]]) is either
$\iota(n)$ or $-\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$, where $\iota$ is the
embedding $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]],
[[def-int-operations]]). This too is a citation and not a slogan: the order on
$\mathbb{Z}$ is total ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), so $m \ge 0$ or $m < 0$; the
image of $\iota$ is exactly the set of nonnegative integers, and each of them is
$\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]); and if $m < 0$ then
$-m > 0$, by compatibility of the order with addition ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]),
so $-m = \iota(n)$ and $m = -\iota(n)$, with $n$ unique because $\iota$ is
injective. The two clauses above therefore define $a^m$ for every
$m \in \mathbb{Z}$ whenever $a \ne 0$, and for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$ for
arbitrary $a$. The clauses are consistent where they overlap: the only overlap is
$m = 0$, where $-\iota(0) = \iota(0)$ and $(a^0)^{-1} = 1^{-1} = 1 = a^0$.

## Remarks

- **The convention $0^0 = 1$ is adopted here**, and it is not a matter of taste
  but of agreement with the recursion above: $a^0 = 1$ is the starting value for
  every $a$, exactly as the empty product is $1$ ([[def-finite-sum]]). This is
  the convention that makes the empty product, the binomial theorem, and
  polynomial notation $\sum_k c_k x^k$ work at $x = 0$ without an exception. The
  competing convention "$0^0$ undefined" belongs to contexts where $x^y$ is
  studied as a function of two *real* variables and one wants continuity, which
  is unavailable and irrelevant here: the exponent in $a^m$ is an integer, never
  a real.
- $0^n = 0$ for every $n \ge 1$, since $0^{n} = 0^{n-1} \cdot 0 = 0$, a product
  with a zero factor ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]); and
  $0^{-n}$ is not defined for $n \ge 1$, since $0$ has no inverse.
- The exponent is an integer and stays an integer. Rational exponents are a
  separate construction resting on the existence of roots
  ([[thm-nth-roots-exist]], [[def-rational-power]]), and real exponents do not
  exist in this library yet ([[rem-real-exponents-deferred]]).
- The laws $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$ are
  proved, not assumed, in [[lem-power-laws]]; the order behaviour of $a \mapsto a^n$
  is [[lem-power-monotone]].

## Statement

Powers are those of [[def-integer-power]], and $\iota : \mathbb{N} \to
\mathbb{R}$ is the canonical natural of [[def-canonical-natural]], so that
$\iota(0) = 0$ and $\iota(m+1) = \iota(m) + 1$. Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

1. The function $p_0 : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, $p_0(x) = x^{0}$, is the
   constant function $1$, and it is differentiable at every $c \in \mathbb{R}$
   with $p_0'(c) = 0$ ([[def-derivative]]).
2. For $n \ge 1$ the function $p_n : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$,
   $p_n(x) = x^{n}$, is differentiable at every $c \in \mathbb{R}$, and
   $$p_n'(c) \;=\; \iota(n)\,c^{\,n-1} .$$
3. For $n \ge 1$ put $A_0 := \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \ne 0 \,\}$. The function
   $m_n : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$, $m_n(x) = x^{-n}$, is differentiable at every
   $c \in A_0$ as a function on $A_0$, and
   $$m_n'(c) \;=\; -\,\iota(n)\,c^{\,-n-1} .$$
4. Let $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with $a_j = 0$ for $j \ge n$, and let
   $P : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be the polynomial function
   $P(x) = \sum_{j<n} a_j x^{j}$ ([[def-finite-sum]]). Then $P$ is
   differentiable at every $c \in \mathbb{R}$, and, defining $e : \mathbb{N}
   \to \mathbb{R}$ by $e_0 := 0$ and $e_j := \iota(j)\,a_j\,c^{\,j-1}$ for
   $j \ge 1$,
   $$P'(c) \;=\; \sum_{j<n} e_j .$$

**Claim 2 is stated for $n \ge 1$ and not for $n \ge 0$, and that is not
timidity.** At $n = 0$ its right-hand side reads $\iota(0)\,c^{-1}$, and
$c^{-1}$ is not defined at $c = 0$ ([[def-integer-power]]), so the formula is
not a statement about the whole line. Claim 1 is what covers $n = 0$, and it
says the derivative is $0$ there, which is what the informal reading
"$0 \cdot c^{-1}$" is reaching for. The same shift is why the term $e_0$ of
claim 4 is defined to be $0$ outright rather than by the formula.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural $n$, a real $c$, and the functions $p_n$, $m_n$ and $P$ of the statement.

[L1] Powers ([[def-integer-power]]): $a^{0} = 1$ and $a^{m+1} = a^{m}a$ for every $a \in \mathbb{R}$ and $m \in \mathbb{N}$; $a^{-m} := (a^{m})^{-1}$ for $a \ne 0$ and $m \ge 1$; and $0^{m} = 0$ for $m \ge 1$.

[L2] Canonical naturals ([[def-canonical-natural]]): $\iota(0) = 0$, $\iota(m+1) = \iota(m) + 1$, and hence $\iota(1) = 1$.

[L3] Algebra of derivatives ([[thm-algebra-of-derivatives]]): at a limit point $c$ of the common domain, sums, scalar multiples and products of functions differentiable at $c$ are differentiable at $c$ with the four stated formulas, and if the denominator is nonzero at $c$ then the quotient, restricted to the set where the denominator does not vanish, is differentiable at $c$ with the quotient formula; that restricted set has $c$ as a limit point.

[L4] Derivative and difference quotient ([[def-derivative]]): $f$ is differentiable at a limit point $c$ of its domain $D$ exactly when the difference quotient $x \mapsto (f(x)-f(c))/(x-c)$, a function on $D \setminus \{c\}$, has a limit at $c$, and $f'(c)$ is that limit. A constant function $h \equiv K$ on a set having $c$ as a limit point has $\lim_{x \to c} h(x) = K$: given a real $\varepsilon > 0$, any real $\delta > 0$ serves, since $|K - K| = 0 < \varepsilon$ ([[def-function-limit]]).

[L5] Induction principle on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L6] Finite sums ([[def-finite-sum]]): $\sum_{j<0} b_j = 0$ and $\sum_{j<m+1} b_j = \bigl(\sum_{j<m} b_j\bigr) + b_m$.

[L7] Integer exponent laws for a nonzero base ([[lem-power-laws]]): $a^{k} \ne 0$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ when $a \ne 0$; and for integers $j, k$ one has $a^{j}a^{k} = a^{j+k}$, $(a^{j})^{k} = a^{jk}$ and $a^{-k} = (a^{k})^{-1}$.

[L8] Every real is a limit point of $\mathbb{R}$, punctured neighbourhoods in $\mathbb{R}$ being never empty ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 **Base case, claim 2 at $n = 1$.** By [L1], $x^{1} = x^{0}x = 1 \cdot x = x$, so $p_1$ is the identity. Fix $c \in \mathbb{R}$; for every $x \ne c$ the difference quotient is $(x - c)/(x - c) = 1$, so it is the constant function $1$ on $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{c\}$, and by [L4] and [L8] its limit at $c$ is $1$. Since $\iota(1)c^{0} = 1 \cdot 1 = 1$ by [L1] and [L2], claim 2 holds at $n = 1$. [base, L1, L2, L4, L8]

1.2 **Inductive hypothesis.** Fix a natural $n \ge 1$ and assume that $p_n$ is differentiable at every $c \in \mathbb{R}$ with $p_n'(c) = \iota(n)c^{\,n-1}$. [ih]

1.3 **Claim 1.** By [L1] the function $p_0$ is the constant function $1$. Fix $c \in \mathbb{R}$; for every $x \ne c$ its difference quotient is $(1-1)/(x-c) = 0$, the constant function $0$ on $\mathbb{R}\setminus\{c\}$, whose limit at $c$ is $0$ by [L4] and [L8]. So $p_0$ is differentiable at every $c$ with $p_0'(c) = 0$. [L1, L4, L8]

2.1 **Successor step.** Let $c \in \mathbb{R}$. By [L1], $p_{n+1}(x) = x^{n+1} = x^{n}x = p_n(x)\,p_1(x)$ for every $x$. Both factors are differentiable at $c$, by step 1.2 and step 1.1, so the product rule of [L3] gives that $p_{n+1}$ is differentiable at $c$ with $p_{n+1}'(c) = p_n'(c)p_1(c) + p_n(c)p_1'(c) = \iota(n)c^{\,n-1}c + c^{n} \cdot 1$. Now $c^{\,n-1}c = c^{\,(n-1)+1} = c^{n}$ by [L1], so the right-hand side is $\iota(n)c^{n} + c^{n} = \bigl(\iota(n)+1\bigr)c^{n} = \iota(n+1)c^{n}$ by [L2]. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1, L2, L3]

3.1 **Claim 2.** Steps 1.1 and 2.1 are the base case and the successor step of an induction over the naturals $n \ge 1$, so by [L5] the function $p_n$ is differentiable at every $c \in \mathbb{R}$ with $p_n'(c) = \iota(n)c^{\,n-1}$, for every natural $n \ge 1$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L5]

4.1 **Claim 3.** Let $n \ge 1$. The set $\{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : p_n(x) \ne 0 \,\}$ is exactly $A_0$: a nonzero $x$ has $x^{n} \ne 0$ by [L7], and $0^{n} = 0$ by [L1]. Fix $c \in A_0$. The constant function $1$ on $\mathbb{R}$ is differentiable at $c$ with derivative $0$ by step 1.3, and $p_n$ is differentiable at $c$ with derivative $\iota(n)c^{\,n-1}$ by step 3.1, with $p_n(c) = c^{n} \ne 0$. So the quotient rule of [L3] applies: the function $x \mapsto 1/x^{n}$ on $A_0$, which by [L1] and [L7] is $m_n$, is differentiable at $c$ with derivative $\bigl(0 \cdot c^{n} - 1 \cdot \iota(n)c^{\,n-1}\bigr)/(c^{n})^{2} = -\iota(n)\,c^{\,n-1}\bigl(c^{\,2n}\bigr)^{-1} = -\iota(n)\,c^{\,n-1-2n} = -\iota(n)\,c^{\,-n-1}$, where $(c^{n})^{2} = c^{\,2n}$ and $c^{\,n-1}c^{\,-2n} = c^{\,-n-1}$ are [L7]. [step 1.3, step 3.1, L1, L3, L7]

4.2 **Claim 4, by a second induction on $n$.** Fix $c \in \mathbb{R}$ and the sequence $a$. At $n = 0$ the sum $P(x) = \sum_{j<0} a_j x^{j}$ is $0$ for every $x$ by [L6], so $P$ is the constant function $0$ and, as in step 1.3, $P'(c) = 0 = \sum_{j<0} e_j$. Suppose the claim holds at $n$, and let $P_{n+1}(x) := \sum_{j<n+1} a_j x^{j}$. By [L6], $P_{n+1}(x) = P_n(x) + a_n x^{n}$ for every $x$, where $P_n(x) = \sum_{j<n} a_j x^{j}$. The function $x \mapsto a_n x^{n}$ is differentiable at $c$ with derivative $e_n$: for $n = 0$ it is the constant $a_n$, of derivative $0 = e_0$, by step 1.3 and the scalar rule of [L3]; for $n \ge 1$ it is the scalar multiple $a_n p_n$, of derivative $a_n \iota(n)c^{\,n-1} = e_n$, by step 3.1 and the scalar rule of [L3]. The inductive hypothesis gives $P_n'(c) = \sum_{j<n} e_j$, so the sum rule of [L3] gives that $P_{n+1}$ is differentiable at $c$ with $P_{n+1}'(c) = \sum_{j<n} e_j + e_n = \sum_{j<n+1} e_j$ by [L6]. By [L5] claim 4 holds for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 1.3, step 3.1, L3, L5, L6]

5.1 All four claims are established: claim 1 by step 1.3, claim 2 by step 3.1, claim 3 by step 4.1 and claim 4 by step 4.2. [step 1.3, step 3.1, step 4.1, step 4.2, discharge-induction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the induction starts at $n = 1$ and not at $n = 0$.** The successor step multiplies by the identity, and the identity is $p_1$; starting at $n = 0$ would require the formula of claim 2 to hold at $n = 0$, which it does not, since $c^{-1}$ is undefined at $c = 0$. The two statements are therefore kept apart, and claim 1 is proved on its own from the definition. This is the same index care that [[def-canonical-natural]] records for families of reciprocals: $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$, and a formula written for "$n$" is a claim about $n = 0$ unless it says otherwise.

- **The negative exponents cost nothing extra.** Claim 3 is the quotient rule of [[thm-algebra-of-derivatives]] applied with numerator the constant $1$, and the domain it produces, the set where $x^{n}$ does not vanish, is exactly $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$; no separate argument and no separate limit is needed. Rational exponents are a different matter, resting on [[thm-nth-roots-exist]], and are treated on the companion page rather than here.

- **Claim 4 is a statement about a finite sum, not about an infinite one.** Nothing here says anything about differentiating a series term by term; that is a separate question, needing hypotheses about convergence that this page does not have and does not assume.
