## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` Statement or counterexample, actively search for a
counterexample to the public claim or a failure in the witness. A false public
claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or materially
inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is nonfatal.

Return no more than 450 words, exactly in this shape:

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be monotone, that is
nondecreasing or nonincreasing ([[def-monotone-function]]), and let
$g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable ([[def-darboux-integral]]). Then $fg$ is
integrable and there is $\xi \in [a,b]$ with

$$\int_a^b f\,g \;=\; f(a)\int_a^{\xi} g \;+\; f(b)\int_{\xi}^{b} g .$$

**No differentiability and no continuity of $f$ is assumed.** A monotone function
may be discontinuous at infinitely many points and is still integrable
([[thm-monotone-implies-integrable]]), and the proof below uses only that its
increments over the subintervals of a partition all have the same sign. This is
the general form; the version usually proved by integration by parts needs $f$
continuously differentiable, which is a strictly stronger hypothesis.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a<b$, a monotone $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, an integrable $g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, and a real $\varepsilon > 0$. Write $G(x) := \int_a^x g$ for the integral function of $g$, and fix a real $K \ge 0$ with $|g(t)| \le K$ for every $t \in [a,b]$.

[L1] A monotone function on $[a,b]$ is bounded and integrable there ([[thm-monotone-implies-integrable]], [[def-monotone-function]], [[def-bounded-set]]); an integrable function is bounded, so $K$ exists ([[def-darboux-sums]]).

[L2] Products of integrable functions are integrable, as are absolute values, and $\bigl|\int_p^q u\bigr| \le \int_p^q |u|$ for $p \le q$ ([[cor-integrability-of-absolute-values-products-and-lattice-operations]]).

[L3] $G$ is defined on $[a,b]$, $G(a) = 0$, $G(y)-G(x) = \int_x^y g$ for all $x,y \in [a,b]$ in either order, and $G$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ ([[def-the-integral-function]], [[thm-the-integral-function-is-lipschitz]], [[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]], [[def-oriented-integral]], [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L4] $[a,b]$ is compact and nonempty, so a continuous real function on it attains a minimum and a maximum, and its image is exactly the closed interval between them ([[thm-heine-borel-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]], [[thm-extreme-value-r]], [[cor-continuous-image-of-an-interval-is-an-interval]], [[def-max-min]], [[def-interval]]).

[L5] Abel summation by parts: with $A_j = \sum_{k<j}\alpha_k$, for every $n \ge 1$ one has $\sum_{k<n}\alpha_k\beta_k = A_n\beta_{n-1} - \sum_{k<n-1}A_{k+1}(\beta_{k+1}-\beta_k)$ ([[lem-abel-summation-by-parts]], [[def-series]]).

[L6] Finite sums: additivity, scaling, splitting with the shift $\sum_{k=p}^{q-1}x_k = \sum_{j<q-p}x_{p+j}$, monotonicity in the terms, and telescoping $\sum_{k<n}(c_{k+1}-c_k) = c_n - c_0$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L7] For a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[a,b]$: $n \ge 1$, $t_0 = a$, $t_k = b$ for $k \ge n$, $\Delta_i = t_{i+1}-t_i > 0$ for $i<n$, $I_i = [t_i,t_{i+1}] \subseteq [a,b]$, and $U(f,P)-L(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}(M_i-m_i)\Delta_i$ with $m_i \le f(x) \le M_i$ for $x \in I_i$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-darboux-sums]]).

[L8] Riemann's criterion for the integrable $f$: for every real $\eta>0$ there is a partition $P$ with $U(f,P)-L(f,P) < \eta$ ([[thm-riemann-criterion]]).

[L9] Linearity and monotonicity of the integral, and $\int_p^q c = c(q-p)$ for a constant ([[thm-linearity-of-the-integral]], [[thm-monotonicity-of-the-integral]], [[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]]).

[L10] Absolute value and ordered-field arithmetic: $-c \le x \le c$ is equivalent to $|x| \le c$, multiplying an inequality by a positive real preserves it and by a negative real reverses it, the order is total and transitive, and a real that is $\le M + \eta$ for every real $\eta>0$ is $\le M$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $f$ is bounded and integrable by [L1], so $fg$ is integrable by [L2]; put $\Psi(x) := \int_a^x fg$, so $\Psi(b) = \int_a^b fg$ and $\Psi(y)-\Psi(x) = \int_x^y fg$ by [L3] applied to $fg$. [given, L1, L2, L3]

1.2 $G$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, so by [L4] there are $m \le M$ with $G[\,[a,b]\,] = [m,M]$, $m = \min G[\,[a,b]\,]$ and $M = \max G[\,[a,b]\,]$. [L3, L4, choose]

1.3 Put $C := f(b) - f(a)$ and, for a partition $P=(n,t)$ of $[a,b]$, put $d_j := f(t_{j+1}) - f(t_j)$ for $j < n$. By [L6], $\sum_{j<n} d_j = f(t_n)-f(t_0) = C$; and all the $d_j$ are $\ge 0$ when $f$ is nondecreasing and all are $\le 0$ when $f$ is nonincreasing, by [L7] and [[def-monotone-function]]. [given, L6, L7, construct]

2.1 **The case $C = 0$.** Then $f(a) = f(b)$, and monotonicity forces $f(x) = f(a)$ for every $x \in [a,b]$, since $f(x)$ lies between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$; so $\int_a^b fg = f(a)\int_a^b g$ by [L9], while the right-hand side at $\xi := a$ is $f(a)\cdot 0 + f(b)\int_a^b g = f(a)\int_a^b g$ by [L3]. The theorem holds with $\xi = a$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, L3, L9, L10]

2.2 **Abel summation on a partition.** Let $P = (n,t)$ be any partition of $[a,b]$. Apply [L5] with $\alpha_k := G(t_{k+1})-G(t_k)$ and $\beta_k := f(t_{k+1})$, noting $t_k \in [a,b]$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ by [L7]. By [L6], $A_j = \sum_{k<j}\bigl(G(t_{k+1})-G(t_k)\bigr) = G(t_j) - G(t_0) = G(t_j)$, since $G(a) = 0$. [step 1.2, L3, L5, L6, L7]

2.3 **$S(P)$ approximates $\int_a^b fg$.** For $k<n$ one has $G(t_{k+1})-G(t_k) = \int_{t_k}^{t_{k+1}}g$ by [L3], so by [L9] the $k$-th term of $\Psi(t_{k+1})-\Psi(t_k) - f(t_{k+1})\bigl(G(t_{k+1})-G(t_k)\bigr)$ equals $\int_{t_k}^{t_{k+1}}\bigl(f - f(t_{k+1})\bigr)g$. [step 1.1, L3, L9]

3.1 So, writing $S(P) := \sum_{k<n}\bigl(G(t_{k+1})-G(t_k)\bigr)f(t_{k+1})$, [L5] gives $S(P) = G(t_n)f(t_n) - \sum_{k<n-1}G(t_{k+1})\bigl(f(t_{k+2})-f(t_{k+1})\bigr) = G(b)f(b) - \sum_{k<n-1}x_{k+1}$, where $x_j := G(t_j)\,d_j$. [step 2.2, L5, L7, construct]

3.2 For $x \in I_k$ both $f(x)$ and $f(t_{k+1})$ lie in $[m_k,M_k]$, so $\bigl|\bigl(f(x)-f(t_{k+1})\bigr)g(x)\bigr| \le K\,(M_k-m_k)$; hence by [L2] and [L9], $-K(M_k-m_k)\Delta_k \le \int_{t_k}^{t_{k+1}}\bigl(f-f(t_{k+1})\bigr)g \le K(M_k-m_k)\Delta_k$. [step 2.3, given, L2, L7, L9, L10]

4.1 By [L6], $\sum_{j<n}x_j = x_0 + \sum_{k<n-1}x_{k+1}$, and $x_0 = G(t_0)d_0 = G(a)d_0 = 0$; so, putting $T(P) := \sum_{j<n}G(t_j)\,d_j$, step 3.1 reads $S(P) = G(b)f(b) - T(P)$. [step 3.1, L3, L6, construct]

4.2 Summing over $k<n$ with [L6], and telescoping $\sum_{k<n}\bigl(\Psi(t_{k+1})-\Psi(t_k)\bigr) = \Psi(b)-\Psi(a) = \int_a^b fg$, gives $\bigl|\int_a^b fg - S(P)\bigr| \le K\bigl(U(f,P)-L(f,P)\bigr)$. [step 1.1, step 2.3, step 3.2, L6, L7, L10]

5.1 **$T(P)$ is $\lambda_P C$ for some $\lambda_P \in [m,M]$, when $C \ne 0$.** By step 1.2, $m \le G(t_j) \le M$ for every $j$. If $f$ is nondecreasing then $d_j \ge 0$, so $m\,d_j \le G(t_j)d_j \le M\,d_j$, and summing with [L6] and step 1.3 gives $mC \le T(P) \le MC$ with $C \ge 0$; if $f$ is nonincreasing then $d_j \le 0$, so $M\,d_j \le G(t_j)d_j \le m\,d_j$, and summing gives $MC \le T(P) \le mC$ with $C \le 0$. Dividing by $C$ in the first case, and by the negative $C$ with the inequalities reversed in the second, gives $m \le T(P)/C \le M$ in both. [step 1.2, step 1.3, step 4.1, L6, L10, construct]

6.1 **The case $C \ne 0$.** Put $\lambda := \bigl(G(b)f(b) - \int_a^b fg\bigr)/C$. By step 4.1, $\int_a^b fg - S(P) = \int_a^b fg - G(b)f(b) + T(P) = \bigl(\lambda_P - \lambda\bigr)C$ for every partition $P$, where $\lambda_P = T(P)/C$. [step 4.1, step 5.1, L10, construct]

7.1 By [L8] fix a partition $P$ with $U(f,P)-L(f,P) < \varepsilon\,|C|/(K+1)$, a positive real; then step 4.2 and step 6.1 give $|\lambda_P - \lambda|\,|C| \le K\bigl(U(f,P)-L(f,P)\bigr) < \varepsilon|C|$, so $|\lambda_P - \lambda| < \varepsilon$. [step 4.2, step 6.1, L8, L10, choose]

8.1 Since $m \le \lambda_P \le M$ by step 5.1, it follows that $m - \varepsilon < \lambda < M + \varepsilon$; as $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary, $m \le \lambda \le M$. [step 5.1, step 7.1, L10]

9.1 By step 1.2, $G[\,[a,b]\,] = [m,M]$, so there is $\xi \in [a,b]$ with $G(\xi) = \lambda$. [step 1.2, step 8.1, L4, choose]

10.1 Then $\int_a^b fg = G(b)f(b) - \lambda C = f(b)G(b) - G(\xi)\bigl(f(b)-f(a)\bigr) = f(a)G(\xi) + f(b)\bigl(G(b)-G(\xi)\bigr)$, and $G(\xi) = \int_a^{\xi}g$ with $G(b)-G(\xi) = \int_{\xi}^{b} g$ by [L3]; this is the stated identity. [step 6.1, step 9.1, L3, algebra]

11.1 The cases $C = 0$ and $C \ne 0$ are exhaustive, so the theorem holds in both. [step 2.1, step 10.1, L10] ∎

## Remarks

- **The published summation-by-parts lemma was matched to its own indexing before it was used.** [[lem-abel-summation-by-parts]] reads $\sum_{k<n}\alpha_k\beta_k = A_n\beta_{n-1} - \sum_{k<n-1}A_{k+1}(\beta_{k+1}-\beta_k)$ with $A_j = \sum_{k<j}\alpha_k$, so $A_0 = 0$ and the boundary value is $\beta_{n-1}$, not $\beta_n$. Taking $\beta_k := f(t_{k+1})$ rather than $f(t_k)$ is what makes that boundary value $f(t_n) = f(b)$; and the shifted sum on the right is a sum over $j = 1, \dots, n-1$ whose missing $j = 0$ term is $G(t_0)d_0 = 0$, because the integral function vanishes at its base point. Both observations are step 3.1 and step 4.1, and the theorem would be off by a term without either.

- **The passage to the limit is an estimate, not a Riemann-sum convergence theorem.** Step 4.2 bounds $\bigl|\int_a^b fg - S(P)\bigr|$ by $K\bigl(U(f,P)-L(f,P)\bigr)$ for *every* partition, and the integrability of $f$ alone drives the right-hand side to $0$. No tagged partition, no mesh condition and no appeal to [[thm-darboux-equals-riemann]] is involved, and the approximating sums are not Riemann sums of $fg$.

- **What is not proved here.** Nothing is claimed about $\xi$ lying in the open interval, and nothing about the sharper form in which $f$ is assumed nonnegative and nonincreasing, where the conclusion becomes $\int_a^b fg = f(a)\int_a^{\xi}g$. That refinement needs the one-sided normalisation of $f$ at $a$ and is not used anywhere on this page.

Several proofs below use this to reduce a nonincreasing\ncase to a nondecreasing one.\n\n**Monotone on a set, not at a point.** All six conditions are conditions on the\nwhole of $A$; unlike continuity ([[def-continuity-real]]) there is no pointwise\nversion, and none is used in this library.

Its\nsubinterval lengths are all equal to $(b-a)/\\iota(N)$, so\n\n$$\\|U_N\\| \\;=\\; \\frac{b-a}{\\iota(N)} .$$\n\n### A partition is determined by its point set\n\n**Claim.** If $P = (n,t)$ and $P' = (n', t')$ are partitions of $[a,b]$ with\n$\\operatorname{pts}(P) = \\operatorname{pts}(P')$, then $n = n'$ and $t_i = t'_i$\nfor every $i \\le n$.\n\n*Proof.* First, $t_i = t'_i$ for every $i \\le \\min\\{n,n'\\}$, by induction on $i$\n([[thm-induction-principle]]). For $i = 0$ both equal $a$. Suppose $t_j = t'_j$\nfor all $j \\le i$ and $i + 1 \\le \\min\\{n,n'\\}$. The set\n$S := \\{\\, x \\in \\operatorname{pts}(P) : x > t_i \\,\\}$ has $t_{i+1}$ as its least\nelement: $t_{i+1} \\in S$, and any $x \\in S$ is $t_j$ for some $j \\le n$ with\n$t_j > t_i$, which forces $j > i$ because $t$ is increasing on indices $\\le n$,\nhence $j \\ge i+1$ and $x = t_j \\ge t_{i+1}$. The same argument in $P'$ makes\n$t'_{i+1}$ the least element of\n$\\{\\, x \\in \\operatorname{pts}(P') : x > t'_i \\,\\}$, which is the same set $S$,\nsince the point sets agree and $t'_i = t_i$. A set has at most one least element\n([[def-max-min]]), so $t_{i+1} = t'_{i+1}$.\n\nSecond, $n = n'$. If $n < n'$ then $t'_n = t_n = b$ by the previous paragraph,\nwhile $t'_n < t'_{n'} = b$ because $t'$ is increasing on indices $\\le n'$ and\n$n < n'$; that is impossible. Exchanging the roles of $P$ and $P'$ rules out\n$n' < n$. $\\square$\n\nSo the map $P \\mapsto \\operatorname{pts}(P)$ is injective, and a partition may be\nnamed by its point set whenever one is exhibited.\n\n### Inserting a point\n\nLet $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ and let $c \\in [a,b]$. Define a\npartition $P + c$ of $[a,b]$ as follows.\n\n- If $c \\in \\operatorname{pts}(P)$, put $P + c := P$.\n- Otherwise $c \\ne a$ and $c \\ne b$, so $a < c < b$. The set\n  $T := \\{\\, t_i : i \\le n \\text{ and } t_i < c \\,\\}$ is a nonempty finite set of\n  reals, nonempty because $t_0 = a < c$, so it has a maximum\n  ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]); let $i_0 \\le n$ be the unique index with\n  $t_{i_0} = \\max T$, unique because $t$ is injective on indices $\\le n$. Then\n  $i_0 < n$, since $t_n = b > c$ puts $t_n \\notin T$; and\n  $$t_{i_0} \\;<\\; c \\;<\\; t_{i_0+1},$$\n  the right inequality because $t_{i_0+1} \\ne c$ (as $c \\notin \\operatorname{pts}(P)$)\n  and $t_{i_0+1} < c$ would put $t_{i_0+1} \\in T$ with $t_{i_0+1} > t_{i_0} = \\max T$.\n  Put $P + c := (n+1, s)$ with\n  $$s_i := t_i \\ (i \\le i_0), \\qquad s_{i_0+1} := c, \\qquad s_i := t_{i-1} \\ (i_0 + 2 \\le i \\le n+1), \\qquad s_k := b \\ (k \\ge n+1).$$\n\nIn both cases $P + c$ is a partition of $[a,b]$ and\n\n$$\\operatorname{pts}(P + c) \\;=\\; \\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\{c\\}, \\qquad \\|P+c\\| \\;\\le\\; \\|P\\| .$$\n\nThe displayed identity is immediate from the two cases. For the mesh: in the\nfirst case nothing changes; in the second the list of subinterval lengths of\n$P + c$ is that of $P$ with $\\Delta_{i_0}$ replaced by the two numbers\n$c - t_{i_0}$ and $t_{i_0+1} - c$, each of which is smaller than\n$\\Delta_{i_0} = (c - t_{i_0}) + (t_{i_0+1} - c)$ because the other is positive.\nSo every length of $P + c$ is at most a length of $P$, and the maximum cannot\nincrease. Finally the index count grows by exactly $1$ in the second case and\nnot at all in the first.\n\n### Refinement and the common refinement\n\n$P'$ **refines** $P$, and is a **refinement** of $P$, when\n\n$$\\operatorname{pts}(P) \\;\\subseteq\\; \\operatorname{pts}(P') .$$\n\nLet $P = (n,t)$ and $Q = (m,s)$ be partitions of $[a,b]$. Applying the recursion\ntheorem ([[thm-recursion]]) to the set $\\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$,\nwhere $\\mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$ is the set of partitions of $[a,b]$, with starting\nelement $(0, P)$ and the map $(j, R) \\mapsto (j+1,\\ R + s_j)$ — legitimate\nbecause $s_j \\in [a,b]$ for every $j \\in \\mathbb{N}$ — gives a unique family\n$(R_j)_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ of partitions with $R_0 = P$ and $R_{j+1} = R_j + s_j$.\nThe **common refinement** of $P$ and $Q$ is\n\n$$P \\vee Q \\;:=\\; R_{m+1} .$$\n\n**Its point set is the union.** By induction on $j$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]),\n$\\operatorname{pts}(R_j) = \\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\{\\, s_l : l < j \\,\\}$;\ntaking $j = m+1$ gives\n\n$$\\operatorname{pts}(P \\vee Q) \\;=\\; \\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\operatorname{pts}(Q).$$\n\nHence $P \\vee Q$ refines both $P$ and $Q$; by the uniqueness claim above it is\nthe **only** partition with that point set, so $P \\vee Q = Q \\vee P$, and\n\n$$P' \\text{ refines } P \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad P \\vee P' = P' ,$$\n\nsince then $\\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\operatorname{pts}(P') =\n\\operatorname{pts}(P')$.\n\n**Two size bounds, both used later.** Writing $n_R$ for the first component of a\npartition $R$:\n\n$$\\|P \\vee Q\\| \\;\\le\\; \\|P\\|, \\qquad n_{P \\vee Q} \\;\\le\\; n_P + n_Q - 1 .$$\n\nThe first is the mesh bound above applied $m+1$ times. For the second, each\ninsertion raises the index count by at most $1$, and the two insertions of\n$s_0 = a$ and $s_m = b$ raise it by $0$, since $a$ and $b$ already lie in\n$\\operatorname{pts}(P)$ and hence in $\\operatorname{pts}(R_j)$ for every $j$; so\nat most $m - 1$ of the $m+1$ insertions increase it.\n\n### The index map of a refinement\n\nLet $P' = (n',t')$ refine $P = (n,t)$. For each $i \\le n$ the point $t_i$ lies in\n$\\operatorname{pts}(P')$, so there is exactly one $\\varphi(i) \\le n'$ with\n$t'_{\\varphi(i)} = t_i$, uniqueness because $t'$ is injective on indices $\\le n'$.\nThe resulting map $\\varphi$ satisfies\n\n$$\\varphi(0) = 0, \\qquad \\varphi(n) = n', \\qquad \\varphi(i) < \\varphi(i+1) \\ \\ (i < n),$$\n\nthe first two because $t'_0 = a = t_0$ and $t'_{n'} = b = t_n$ together with\ninjectivity, and the third because $t_i < t_{i+1}$ and $t'$ is increasing on\nindices $\\le n'$. In particular $n \\le n'$. Moreover, for $i < n$ and\n$\\varphi(i) \\le j < \\varphi(i+1)$,\n\n$$I'_j \\;=\\; [\\,t'_j,\\ t'_{j+1}\\,] \\;\\subseteq\\; [\\,t_i,\\ t_{i+1}\\,] \\;=\\; I_i ,$$\n\nbecause $t_i = t'_{\\varphi(i)} \\le t'_j$ and $t'_{j+1} \\le t'_{\\varphi(i+1)} = t_{i+1}$.\n\n**The blocks are counted by telescoping.** By clause 5 of\n[[lem-finite-sum-laws]],\n$\\sum_{i<n}\\big(\\varphi(i+1) - \\varphi(i)\\big) = \\varphi(n) - \\varphi(0) = n'$,\nso, subtracting $\\sum_{i<n} 1 = n$,\n\n$$\\sum_{i<n} \\big(\\varphi(i+1) - \\varphi(i) - 1\\big) \\;=\\; n' - n ,$$\n\na sum of $n$ nonnegative integers, one for each block, which vanishes exactly at\nthe blocks consisting of a single index.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $A$
([[def-continuity-real]]) and let $I \subseteq A$ be order-convex
([[def-interval]]). Then:

1. $f[I]$ is order-convex, hence connected
   ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]], [[def-connected-r]]);
2. if $I = [a,b]$ with $a \le b$, then $f[I] = [m, M]$ where
   $m = \min f[I]$ and $M = \max f[I]$ ([[def-max-min]]) — a **closed bounded
   interval**, degenerate exactly when $f$ is constant on $[a,b]$.

**"Interval" means "order-convex" here.** As [[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]]
records, this library proves that the connected subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ are
exactly the order-convex ones, and does **not** prove that every order-convex
subset is one of the nine written forms of [[def-interval]]. Claim 1 is
therefore stated as order-convexity, which is what the intermediate value
theorem delivers; claim 2 identifies the written form in the one case where the
extreme value theorem supplies the endpoints.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ continuous on $A$, and an order-convex set $I \subseteq A$.

[L1] Intermediate value theorem: if $u \le v$ in $\mathbb{R}$, if $f$ is continuous on $[u,v]$ and if $w$ lies between $f(u)$ and $f(v)$ in either order, then $f(t) = w$ for some $t \in [u,v]$ ([[thm-intermediate-value]]).

[L2] Continuity passes to subsets of the domain: if $B \subseteq A$ then $f|_B$ is continuous on $B$, since the defining condition quantifies over fewer points ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L3] Order-convexity: $x, z \in S$ and $x \le w \le z$ imply $w \in S$; every closed bounded interval $[u,v]$ with $u \le v$ is order-convex and is a subset of any order-convex set containing $u$ and $v$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L4] Connectedness: a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is connected if and only if it is order-convex ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]], [[def-connected-r]]).

[L5] $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$ is nonempty, closed and bounded ([[def-interval]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-bounded-set]]), hence compact ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L6] Extreme value theorem: a continuous real function on a nonempty compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ attains a greatest and a least value on it ([[thm-extreme-value-r]], [[def-max-min]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Claim 1.** Let $u', v' \in f[I]$ and let $w$ satisfy $u' \le w \le v'$. Write $u' = f(p)$ and $v' = f(q)$ with $p, q \in I$, and let $[s,t]$ be the closed bounded interval with $\{s,t\} = \{p,q\}$ and $s \le t$; by [L3] and order-convexity of $I$ we have $[s,t] \subseteq I \subseteq A$. [L3, choose]

1.2 **Claim 2, the endpoints.** Suppose $I = [a,b]$ with $a \le b$. By [L5] the set $[a,b]$ is nonempty and compact, so by [L6] there are $q, p \in [a,b]$ with $f(q) \le f(x) \le f(p)$ for every $x \in [a,b]$; put $m := f(q)$ and $M := f(p)$, so $m = \min f[I]$ and $M = \max f[I]$ and $m \le M$. [L5, L6, choose]

2.1 By [L2] the restriction of $f$ to $[s,t]$ is continuous on $[s,t]$, and $w$ lies between $f(s)$ and $f(t)$ in one order or the other, since $\{f(s), f(t)\} = \{u', v'\}$ and $u' \le w \le v'$. By [L1] there is $c \in [s,t] \subseteq I$ with $f(c) = w$, so $w \in f[I]$. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

3.1 So $f[I]$ is order-convex, and by [L4] it is connected. This is claim 1. [step 2.1, L4]

4.1 **Claim 2, the two inclusions.** Every $z \in f[I]$ satisfies $m \le z \le M$ by step 1.2, so $f[I] \subseteq [m,M]$. Conversely, $m$ and $M$ lie in $f[I]$ and $f[I]$ is order-convex by step 3.1, so every $w$ with $m \le w \le M$ lies in $f[I]$; hence $[m,M] \subseteq f[I]$. Therefore $f[I] = [m,M]$, a closed bounded interval, and it is the single point $\{m\}$ exactly when $m = M$, that is exactly when $f$ is constant on $[a,b]$. [step 3.1, step 1.2, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **The two halves come from the two theorems.** Order-convexity of the image is the intermediate value theorem and needs nothing else; that the image of a *closed bounded* interval is again closed and bounded is the extreme value theorem, and it fails for other interval forms: the continuous image of $(0,1)$ under $x \mapsto 1/x$ is $(1,\infty)$, and under $x \mapsto x$ it is $(0,1)$, neither closed.

- **The converse of claim 1 is false.** A function whose image on every subinterval is order-convex need not be continuous; this is the intermediate value property without continuity, and the witness for it is not available at this point in the reading order. What *is* true, and is proved on this page, is that a function which is monotone and has an order-convex image is continuous ([[lem-monotone-with-interval-image-is-continuous]]).

- **Claim 2 is the shape the $n$-th-root example uses.** Applying it to $x \mapsto x^{n}$ on $[0, a+1]$ gives an interval containing $0$ and $(a+1)^{n} \ge a$, hence containing $a$; that is the second proof of the existence of $n$-th roots recorded in [[ex-ivt-gives-nth-roots]] on the companion page.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]). Then:

1. $|f|$, $f^{2}$ and $fg$ are integrable on $[a,b]$
   ([[def-abs-value]], [[def-integer-power]]);
2. $\max(f,g)$ and $\min(f,g)$, defined pointwise
   ([[def-max-min]]), are integrable on $[a,b]$;
3. the **triangle inequality for the integral**:
   $$\Bigl|\int_a^b f\Bigr| \;\le\; \int_a^b |f| .$$

**Claim 3 is stated with $a < b$ and is not orientation-invariant.** For $u > v$
the right-hand side is $-\int_v^u |f| \le 0$ while the left-hand side is $\ge 0$,
so the inequality as written is false there. The form valid for *every* pair
$u,v$ on which $f$ is integrable ([[def-oriented-integral]]) is

$$\Bigl|\int_u^v f\Bigr| \;\le\; \Bigl|\int_u^v |f|\,\Bigr| ,$$

and that is the form the estimates below on this page use whenever the limits
are not known to be in increasing order.

**The converse of claim 1 fails.** Integrability of $|f|$ does not give
integrability of $f$; the witness is on the companion page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and integrable $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] If $u$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ with values in $[m,M]$ and $\varphi$ is continuous on $[m,M]$, then $\varphi\circ u$ is integrable ([[thm-composition-with-a-continuous-function]]); an integrable function is bounded, so such $m$ and $M$ exist ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-bounded-set]], [[def-interval]]).

[L2] Sums and scalar multiples of integrable functions are integrable, with $\int_a^b(\lambda u + \nu w) = \lambda\int_a^b u + \nu\int_a^b w$ ([[thm-linearity-of-the-integral]]).

[L3] If $u \le w$ pointwise on $[a,b]$ and both are integrable then $\int_a^b u \le \int_a^b w$ ([[thm-monotonicity-of-the-integral]]).

[L4] The absolute value $t \mapsto |t|$, the square $t \mapsto t^{2}$ and every polynomial function are continuous on every subset of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], claims 2 and 5, [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L5] For reals $s,t$: $\max\{s,t\} = (s + t + |s-t|)\cdot 2^{-1}$ and $\min\{s,t\} = (s + t - |s-t|)\cdot 2^{-1}$, and $st = \bigl((s+t)^{2} - (s-t)^{2}\bigr)\cdot 4^{-1}$ ([[def-max-min]], [[def-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L6] Absolute value: $-|t| \le t \le |t|$, and $|t| \le c$ follows from $-c \le t \le c$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]]).

[L7] With oriented limits, $\int_v^u u = -\int_u^v u$ and $\int_u^u u = 0$ ([[def-oriented-integral]]).

[L8] Ordered-field arithmetic: adding constants and multiplying by positive reals preserve inequalities, and the order is total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $f$ is bounded, so fix reals $m \le M$ with $f[\,[a,b]\,] \subseteq [m,M]$; the same for $g$, and for $f+g$ and $f-g$, which are integrable by [L2]. [given, L1, L2, choose]

1.2 The maps $t \mapsto |t|$ and $t \mapsto t^{2}$ are continuous on any closed bounded interval, by [L4]. [L4]

2.1 By [L1] applied with $\varphi(t) = |t|$ to $f$, to $g$ and to $f-g$, the functions $|f|$, $|g|$ and $|f-g|$ are integrable. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1]

2.2 By [L1] applied with $\varphi(t) = t^{2}$ to $f$, to $f+g$ and to $f-g$, the functions $f^{2}$, $(f+g)^{2}$ and $(f-g)^{2}$ are integrable. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1]

3.1 By [L5], $fg = \bigl((f+g)^{2}-(f-g)^{2}\bigr)\cdot 4^{-1}$ pointwise, so $fg$ is integrable by [L2]; this completes claim 1. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L2, L5]

3.2 By [L5], $\max(f,g) = \bigl(f + g + |f-g|\bigr)\cdot 2^{-1}$ and $\min(f,g) = \bigl(f+g-|f-g|\bigr)\cdot 2^{-1}$ pointwise, so both are integrable by [L2]; this is claim 2. [step 2.1, L2, L5]

3.3 **Claim 3.** By [L6], $-|f| \le f \le |f|$ pointwise on $[a,b]$, and all three functions are integrable by step 2.1 and [L2]. [step 2.1, L2, L6]

4.1 By [L3] applied twice, $-\int_a^b|f| \le \int_a^b f \le \int_a^b |f|$, using $\int_a^b(-|f|) = -\int_a^b|f|$ from [L2]. [step 3.3, L2, L3]

5.1 Hence $\bigl|\int_a^b f\bigr| \le \int_a^b|f|$ by [L6], which is claim 3. [step 4.1, L6]

6.1 **The oriented form.** For $u = v$ both sides are $0$ by [L7]; for $u < v$ it is claim 3 on $[u,v]$; and for $u > v$ both $\int_u^v f$ and $\int_u^v |f|$ are the negatives of the corresponding integrals over $[v,u]$ by [L7], so the two absolute values are unchanged and claim 3 on $[v,u]$ gives the inequality. [step 5.1, L7, L8] ∎

## Remarks

- **Every integrability clause comes from one theorem plus linearity.** The only input that produces integrability is [[thm-composition-with-a-continuous-function]], with [[thm-linearity-of-the-integral]] recombining the pieces; claim 3 additionally uses [[thm-monotonicity-of-the-integral]], which is the one place an inequality between integrals is needed. The identities of [L5] are algebra, and they are what turns a statement about composing with $|\cdot|$ and $(\cdot)^2$ into statements about products and lattice operations. In particular no new estimate on Darboux sums is made here.

- **The polarisation identity is used, and it is why $f^2$ comes first.** There is no direct route from integrability of $f$ and of $g$ to integrability of $fg$ through the composition theorem, because $(s,t) \mapsto st$ is a function of two variables and the theorem composes with one. Writing $fg$ through squares of sums and differences reduces it to the one-variable case.

- **The inequality of claim 3 is the integral analogue of the triangle inequality**, and like it, it can be strict: for $f(x) = x$ on $[-1,1]$ the left-hand side is $0$ and the right-hand side is $1$.

- **Forward reference, orientation only.** The witness refuting the converse of claim 1 is [[cex-absolute-value-integrable-without-the-function]] on the companion page; nothing above depends on it.

## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]). The **absolute value** of
$x \in F$ is

$$|x| \;:=\; \begin{cases} x & \text{if } x \ge 0, \\ -x & \text{if } x < 0. \end{cases}$$

## Remarks

- The distance between $x$ and $y$ is $|x - y|$.
- The basic algebraic properties ($|x| \ge 0$, $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$,
  $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$, and the characterisation $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$) are

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ denotes the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a subset of it.

The notions **upper bound** and **bounded above** are already fixed by
[[def-complete-ordered-field]] and are only recalled here, never redefined:
$u \in \mathbb{R}$ is an *upper bound* of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$, and
$S$ is *bounded above* if it has at least one upper bound. The dual notions are:

- $\ell \in \mathbb{R}$ is a **lower bound** of $S$ if $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.
- $S$ is **bounded below** if it has at least one lower bound.
- $S$ is **bounded** if it is both bounded above and bounded below, that is, if
  there are $\ell, u \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\ell \le s \le u$ for every $s \in S$.

## Remarks

- A bound is an element of $\mathbb{R}$ and is not required to lie in $S$. A
  bound that does lie in $S$ is a maximum or a minimum ([[def-max-min]]), and
  that is a strictly stronger condition ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Bounds come in half-lines: if $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$ then so is every
  $\ell'' \le \ell$, and if $u$ is an upper bound then so is every $u'' \ge u$.
  Consequently a set that has one bound of a given kind has infinitely many, and
  the interesting question is whether the collection of them has a best element,
  which is what a supremum ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) or an infimum
  ([[def-infimum]]) is.
- Bounded above and bounded below are independent conditions. The set
  $A = \{\, n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} : n \ge 1 \,\}$ of canonical naturals of
  $\mathbb{R}$ is bounded below by $0$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]) and is not
  bounded above ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); its reflection $-A$ is bounded above
  and not bounded below ([[lem-reflection]]).
- The empty set is bounded, and vacuously so: every real number is both an upper
  bound and a lower bound of $\emptyset$, since the defining condition quantifies
  over no elements. Having bounds is therefore much weaker than having a least
  upper bound or a greatest lower bound ([[fs-every-set-has-sup]]).

## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq F$.

- $u \in F$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$; $S$ is
  **bounded above** if it has an upper bound.
- $u \in F$ is a **least upper bound** (or **supremum**, $\sup S$) of $S$ if $u$
  is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le u'$ for every upper bound $u'$ of $S$.

$F$ is a **complete ordered field** (equivalently, $F$ has the
**least-upper-bound property**, or is **Dedekind complete**) if every nonempty
$S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$.

## Remarks

- A least upper bound, if it exists, is unique (two least upper bounds are each
  $\le$ the other, so equal by antisymmetry of the order).
- Applying the property to $\{-s : s \in S\}$ yields the dual **greatest lower
  bound** (infimum) property, so the two are equivalent.
- The Dedekind-cut reals have this property by construction
  ([[thm-dedekind-complete]]); the Cauchy-sequence reals acquire it via
  [[cor-cauchy-reals-lub-complete]]. This definition is the target for the
  uniqueness theorem [[thm-uniqueness-complete-ordered-field]].

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field with its order and
absolute value ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]), and
neighbourhoods are those of [[def-neighbourhood-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Then
$f$ is **continuous at $c$** when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

with $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ ranging over the **positive reals**. In the
language of neighbourhoods: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ with

$$f\bigl(A \cap N_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \;\subseteq\; N_{\varepsilon}\bigl(f(c)\bigr).$$

$f$ is **continuous on $A$** when it is continuous at every point of $A$.

**The point $c$ is required to lie in $A$, and the condition is unpunctured.**
Both differ from [[def-function-limit]], and deliberately. There the quantifier
runs over $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, which removes $x = c$; here $x = c$ is allowed,
and at $x = c$ the implication reads $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$, which is
automatic. So allowing $x = c$ costs nothing, and it is what lets the definition
be stated at every point of $A$, including the points where no limit exists.

**Three clauses, and all three are part of the definition.**

1. **At a limit point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is a limit point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]). Then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if the
   limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) \;=\; f(c)$$
   ([[def-function-limit]]). Indeed, for a given $\varepsilon > 0$ a $\delta$
   witnessing continuity witnesses the limit condition, because the limit
   condition quantifies over a subset of the points continuity quantifies over;
   and conversely a $\delta$ witnessing $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$ witnesses
   continuity, because the one point it omits, $x = c$, satisfies
   $|f(c) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ anyway.

2. **At an isolated point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is an isolated point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so that $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ for some real
   $\eta > 0$. Then **every** $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$: take
   $\delta := \eta$, so that the only $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ is $c$
   itself, and $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$.

3. **On a set.** Continuity on $A$ is continuity at each point of $A$, and
   nothing more. It is not a condition relating $f$ to points outside $A$.

Every point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$,
and never both ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so clauses 1 and 2 between them describe
continuity at every point of $A$.

**This is not the raw $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula of
[[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]].** That item records what goes
wrong when the *punctured* formula of [[def-function-limit]] is written down at
an arbitrary point of the domain: at an isolated point it is satisfied
vacuously by every real $L$ at once, so it defines nothing, and this library
therefore leaves $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ **undefined** at an isolated point.
Continuity at an isolated point is a different matter: the formula above is not
vacuous — it is a genuine condition on $f(c)$, satisfied because $f(c)$ is the
only value being compared with itself — and it names a single, well-defined
property. The limit is undefined there; the continuity is defined, and is
automatic. Clause 1 is the only place where the two notions meet, and it is
stated only where the limit exists as a notion.

**Where the distinction disappears.** If $A$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), then every $c \in A$ has some
$N_{\eta}(c) \subseteq A$, and a punctured neighbourhood is never empty
([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), so every point of $A$ is a limit point of $A$ and
clause 1 covers the whole of $A$. The same holds when $A$ is a nondegenerate
interval ([[def-interval]]). Isolated points are what force clause 2 to exist at
all, and they occur as soon as $A$ is allowed to be an arbitrary subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, as in $A = \{0\} \cup [1,2]$.

## Remarks

- **Continuity is local.** If $\eta > 0$ and $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agrees with
  $f$ on $A \cap N_{\eta}(c)$, then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if $g$
  is: any $\delta$ may be replaced by $\min\{\delta, \eta\}$, after which the
  condition only ever evaluates the two functions where they agree. So
  continuity at $c$ sees only an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of $c$, exactly
  as the limit does ([[lem-limit-is-local]]).

- **Continuity passes to subsets of the domain.** If $B \subseteq A$ and
  $c \in B$, then continuity of $f$ at $c$ gives continuity of the restriction
  $f|_B$ at $c$, with the same $\delta$: the condition on $f|_B$ quantifies over
  fewer points. The converse fails, and the standard witness is the indicator of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ restricted to $\mathbb{Q}$, which is constant and hence
  continuous, while the indicator itself is continuous nowhere
  ([[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]]).

- **The radius is a real number.** As in [[def-neighbourhood-r]], $\varepsilon$
  and $\delta$ range over the positive reals here. Restricting either quantifier
  to the positive rationals defines the same relation, by the passage recorded
  in [[def-function-limit]]: below every positive real lies a positive rational
  ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and a real $\delta$ may be shrunk to a rational
  one below it.

- **The word *continuous* is used for two things in this library, and they
  agree.** [[def-metric-continuity]] defines continuity of a map between metric
  spaces, and $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ carries the metric $d(x,y) = |x-y|$. The
  two notions coincide, and that is proved, not assumed:
  [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]] is the dictionary, and it is stated on
  this page precisely so that no later item has to guess.

## Definition

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]). Write $\mathcal{P}$ for the set of all partitions of
$[a,b]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]) and put

$$\mathcal{L} \;:=\; \{\, L(f,P) \ : \ P \in \mathcal{P} \,\}, \qquad \mathcal{U} \;:=\; \{\, U(f,P) \ : \ P \in \mathcal{P} \,\}$$

for the sets of lower and of upper Darboux sums ([[def-darboux-sums]]).

### Both extrema exist

**$\mathcal{P}$ is nonempty**: the pair $(1, t)$ with $t_0 := a$ and $t_k := b$
for $k \ge 1$ is a partition of $[a,b]$, since $a < b$. So $\mathcal{L}$ and
$\mathcal{U}$ are nonempty.

**$\mathcal{L}$ is bounded above and $\mathcal{U}$ is bounded below.** Fix any
$Q \in \mathcal{P}$. By claim 2 of [[lem-refinement-inequalities]],
$L(f,P) \le U(f,Q)$ for every $P \in \mathcal{P}$, so $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound
of $\mathcal{L}$; and $L(f,Q) \le U(f,P)$ for every $P$, so $L(f,Q)$ is a lower
bound of $\mathcal{U}$.

Hence a nonempty set bounded above has a supremum
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and a nonempty set bounded below has an infimum
([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]), each unique ([[lem-sup-unique]]).
The **lower** and **upper Darboux integrals** of $f$ over $[a,b]$ are the real
numbers

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;:=\; \sup \mathcal{L} \;=\; \sup_{P} L(f,P), \qquad \overline{\int_a^b} f \;:=\; \inf \mathcal{U} \;=\; \inf_{P} U(f,P) .$$

### The lower integral never exceeds the upper one

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f .$$

Indeed, for each fixed $Q \in \mathcal{P}$ the number $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound
of $\mathcal{L}$, so the least upper bound satisfies
$\underline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,Q)$. As $Q$ was arbitrary, $\underline{\int_a^b}f$
is a lower bound of $\mathcal{U}$, and the greatest lower bound satisfies
$\underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f$ ([[def-infimum]]).

Moreover, for **every** partition $P$,

$$L(f,P) \;\le\; \underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; U(f,P) ,$$

the outer inequalities because a member of a set is at most its supremum and at
least its infimum.

### Integrability

$f$ is **Darboux integrable on $[a,b]$**, and on this page simply
**integrable**, when

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;=\; \overline{\int_a^b} f ,$$

and then the common value is written

$$\int_a^b f \qquad \text{or} \qquad \int_a^b f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x ,$$

the **integral of $f$ over $[a,b]$**. It is a single well-determined real
number, being the common value of two numbers each of which is unique
([[lem-sup-unique]]). Without the displayed equality the symbol $\int_a^b f$ is
not defined and is never written.

**The inequality above is the whole difficulty.** By the previous paragraph
integrability is *never* a question of one integral exceeding the other, only of
the gap $\overline{\int_a^b} f - \underline{\int_a^b} f \ge 0$ being $0$; and by
[[thm-riemann-criterion]] that gap is $0$ exactly when a single partition can be
found making $U(f,P) - L(f,P)$ small. Whether that is possible is settled
completely, in terms of the discontinuities of $f$, by
[[thm-lebesgue-criterion]].

**"Riemann integrable" means the same thing here.** The definition above is
Darboux's. Riemann's own definition, in terms of tagged partitions of small
mesh, is [[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]], and the two define the same
class of functions with the same integral by [[thm-darboux-equals-riemann]].
Until that theorem is proved the two phrases are kept apart; after it they are
used interchangeably, as they are throughout the literature.

## Remarks

- **The supremum is over all partitions, and nothing is selected.** Both
  $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{U}$ are sets determined by $f$ and $[a,b]$ alone,
  and $\sup$ and $\inf$ are canonical, so no choice principle is involved in
  forming either integral. Where a choice does enter on this page is recorded in
  [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].

- **Why the lower integral is a supremum and not an infimum.** Refining a
  partition can only increase a lower sum and decrease an upper sum
  ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]]), so the lower sums push up towards the
  integral and the upper sums push down towards it. Taking $\inf \mathcal{L}$
  would return the sum over the coarsest partition and would carry no
  information about $f$ beyond its infimum on $[a,b]$.

- **A bounded $f$ always has both integrals; only their equality can fail.** The
  Dirichlet function on $[0,1]$ has lower integral $0$ and upper integral $1$
  ([[fs-bounded-implies-riemann-integrable]]), which is the standard witness that
  the definition above is not vacuous in either direction.

## Definition

Let $a < b$ be reals, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be **bounded**
([[def-bounded-set]]), so that there is a real $M \ge 0$ with $|f(x)| \le M$ for
every $x \in [a,b]$, and let $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ with
subintervals $I_i = [t_i, t_{i+1}]$ and lengths $\Delta_i = t_{i+1} - t_i$ for
$i < n$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

### The two extreme values on a subinterval

For $i < n$ put

$$m_i \;:=\; \inf f[I_i], \qquad M_i \;:=\; \sup f[I_i], \qquad f[I_i] \;=\; \{\, f(x) : x \in I_i \,\} .$$

**Both exist.** The set $f[I_i]$ is nonempty, because $t_i < t_{i+1}$ makes $I_i$
nonempty ([[def-interval]]), and it is bounded, because $|f(x)| \le M$ for every
$x$ ([[def-bounded-set]]). A nonempty set bounded above has a supremum
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and a nonempty set bounded below has an infimum
([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]); each is unique, so the notations
$\inf f[I_i]$ and $\sup f[I_i]$ name single real numbers ([[lem-sup-unique]]).

**They bracket the values, and each other.** For $x \in I_i$,

$$-M \;\le\; m_i \;\le\; f(x) \;\le\; M_i \;\le\; M ,$$

the outer inequalities because $-M$ is a lower bound and $M$ an upper bound of
$f[I_i]$, and the middle ones by the definitions of infimum and supremum. In
particular $m_i \le M_i$ and $M_i - m_i \le 2M$.

The dependence of $m_i$ and $M_i$ on $f$ and on $P$ is suppressed in the
notation, as is customary; where two partitions are in play the sums below carry
the partition and the extreme values are written out.

### The two Darboux sums

$$L(f,P) \;:=\; \sum_{i<n} m_i \,\Delta_i, \qquad U(f,P) \;:=\; \sum_{i<n} M_i \,\Delta_i ,$$

the finite sums of [[def-finite-sum]], indexed by $i \in \mathbb{N}$ with
$i < n$. Both are real numbers, being finite sums of reals, and

$$L(f,P) \;\le\; U(f,P) ,$$

by monotonicity of finite sums, clause 4 of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], since
$m_i \Delta_i \le M_i \Delta_i$ for every $i < n$: multiplying $m_i \le M_i$ by
$\Delta_i > 0$ preserves the inequality ([[def-ordered-field]]).

### The gap on a subinterval is the oscillation there

For every $i < n$,

$$M_i - m_i \;=\; \omega_f(I_i) \;=\; \sup\{\, |f(x) - f(y)| \ : \ x, y \in I_i \,\} ,$$

the oscillation of $f$ on the set $I_i$ ([[def-oscillation]]). The supremum is a
real number here rather than an extended one, because $f$ is bounded
([[def-oscillation]], [[def-extended-reals]]). The identity is proved in two
inequalities.

*The oscillation is at most the gap.* For $x, y \in I_i$ both $f(x)$ and $f(y)$
lie in $[m_i, M_i]$, so $f(x) - f(y) \le M_i - m_i$ and
$f(y) - f(x) \le M_i - m_i$, whence $|f(x) - f(y)| \le M_i - m_i$
([[lem-of-abs-value]]). So $M_i - m_i$ is an upper bound of the set whose
supremum is $\omega_f(I_i)$.

*The gap is at most the oscillation.* Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real. By the
$\varepsilon$-characterisations of the supremum and the infimum
([[lem-sup-epsilon]], [[lem-inf-epsilon]]) there are $x, y \in I_i$ with
$f(x) > M_i - \varepsilon/2$ and $f(y) < m_i + \varepsilon/2$; then

$$|f(x) - f(y)| \;\ge\; f(x) - f(y) \;>\; (M_i - m_i) - \varepsilon ,$$

so $\omega_f(I_i) > (M_i - m_i) - \varepsilon$. As $\varepsilon > 0$ was
arbitrary, $\omega_f(I_i) \ge M_i - m_i$: otherwise
$\varepsilon := (M_i - m_i) - \omega_f(I_i)$ would be positive and give
$\omega_f(I_i) > \omega_f(I_i)$.

This identity is what connects the Darboux machinery to the pointwise
oscillation of [[def-oscillation]], and it is the hinge of
[[thm-lebesgue-criterion]].

## Remarks

- **Boundedness is a hypothesis of the definition, not of the theorems.** Without
  it $f[I_i]$ may fail to have a supremum in $\mathbb{R}$ and $U(f,P)$ is not
  defined at all. Every statement on this page that mentions $L$ or $U$ therefore
  carries "bounded $f$" in its hypotheses, and none of them is a restriction that
  could be lifted: an unbounded function has no Darboux sums to compare.

- **Why the infimum and the supremum, and not a value of $f$.** Replacing $m_i$
  by $f(\xi_i)$ for a point $\xi_i \in I_i$ gives the Riemann sums of
  [[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]], which depend on a choice of points
  and are not extremal. The Darboux sums are canonical functions of $f$ and $P$
  alone, which is what makes the supremum and infimum over all partitions in
  [[def-darboux-integral]] well posed without any selection.

- **The empty sum does not occur.** A partition has $n \ge 1$
  ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]), so $L(f,P)$ and $U(f,P)$ are sums of at
  least one term. The first term is $m_0 \Delta_0$, over the subinterval
  $[a, t_1]$; the indexing starts at $i = 0$ throughout this page.

## Definition

Throughout this page $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), in particular an ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]]) and a field ([[def-field]]), and $\mathbb{N}$ is the set
of natural numbers ([[def-natural-numbers]]) with successor $\sigma(n) = n + 1$
([[def-nat-addition]]).

Let $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a sequence of reals, written $a_k$ for
$a(k)$. **Finite sums and finite products of $a$ are defined by recursion on the
upper index**, which is legitimate because of the recursion theorem
([[thm-recursion]]). That theorem produces a function of one variable, so the
running index has to be carried along inside the value: applying it to the set
$A = \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$, the starting element $(0, 0)$ and the function
$f(n, s) = (\sigma(n),\, s + a_n)$ gives a unique
$g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$ with

$$g(0) = (0, 0), \qquad g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n)) \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Write $g(n) = \big(\pi_1(g(n)),\, \Sigma_n\big)$ for its two coordinates.

**The first coordinate is the index itself, and that is a small induction, not an
observation** ([[thm-induction-principle]]). Indeed $\pi_1(g(0)) = 0$; and if
$\pi_1(g(n)) = n$, then
$g(\sigma(n)) = f\big(\pi_1(g(n)), \Sigma_n\big) = \big(\sigma(\pi_1(g(n))),\, \Sigma_n + a_{\pi_1(g(n))}\big) = \big(\sigma(n),\, \Sigma_n + a_n\big)$,
so $\pi_1(g(\sigma(n))) = \sigma(n)$. By induction $\pi_1(g(n)) = n$ for every
$n \in \mathbb{N}$. Only now may the second coordinate of the two displayed
clauses be read off, and doing so gives

$$\Sigma_0 = 0, \qquad \Sigma_{\sigma(n)} = \Sigma_n + a_n .$$

$\Sigma$ is moreover the **unique** function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with those
two properties: if $\Sigma'$ also has them then $n \mapsto (n, \Sigma'_n)$ satisfies
the two clauses defining $g$, hence equals $g$ by the uniqueness clause of
[[thm-recursion]], so $\Sigma' = \Sigma$.

We write $\sum_{k < n} a_k := \Sigma_n$. The same construction with starting
element $(0, 1)$ and $f(n, p) = (\sigma(n),\, p \cdot a_n)$, with the same
induction on the first coordinate and the same uniqueness argument, gives the
unique $\Pi : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with

$$\Pi_0 = 1, \qquad \Pi_{\sigma(n)} = \Pi_n \cdot a_n ,$$

and we write $\prod_{k < n} a_k := \Pi_n$.

**Notation.** For $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ we abbreviate

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \sum_{k < n+1} a_k, \qquad \prod_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \prod_{k < n+1} a_k,$$

and, for a general lower index $m$ with $m \le n + 1$, writing $d = n + 1 - m$
for the number of terms,

$$\sum_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \sum_{j < d} a_{m+j}, \qquad \prod_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \prod_{j < d} a_{m+j} .$$

When $m = n + 1$ we have $d = 0$ and the sum is **empty**, with value $0$, while
the empty product has value $1$. In the same spirit $\sum_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ is
notation for the empty sum $\Sigma_0 = 0$ and $\prod_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ for the
empty product $\Pi_0 = 1$; the index $-1$ never occurs as an element of
$\mathbb{N}$ and is only a way of writing "no terms".

Only finitely many values of $a$ enter $\sum_{k<n} a_k$, so the notation
$\sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\prod_{k<n} a_k$ is also used for a list
$a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$ of reals given without reference to any extension of the
list to all of $\mathbb{N}$: extend the list by $a_k = 0$ (respectively
$a_k = 1$) for $k \ge n$ and apply the definition above.

## Remarks

- **Why recursion and not "$a_0 + a_1 + \cdots + a_{n-1}$".** The dots are not a
  definition: they presuppose that the displayed pattern determines a value for
  every $n$, which is exactly what the recursion theorem
  ([[thm-recursion]]) supplies, and its uniqueness clause is what makes
  $\sum_{k<n} a_k$ a single well-determined real rather than a family of choices.
  Associativity and commutativity of addition are *not* used in the definition;
  they are used in the laws proved from it ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).
- **Naturals and rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$ (a convention used on the whole
  page).** A natural number $n$ and a rational number $r$ are not literally
  elements of $\mathbb{R}$: they enter $\mathbb{R}$ through the canonical
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$, which is an injective,
  order-preserving field homomorphism ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), restricting on
  positive naturals to $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} = 1_\mathbb{R} + \cdots + 1_\mathbb{R}$
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). Following ordinary practice, and only where no
  confusion is possible, we write $n$ for $\iota(n)$ and $r$ for $\iota(r)$; so,
  for instance, $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k<n} a_k$ means
  $\iota(n)^{-1} \cdot \sum_{k<n} a_k$, which makes sense because
  $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$. Exponents are the one place where the
  identification is deliberately NOT made: in $a^n$ and $a^r$ the exponent stays
  a natural, an integer or a rational ([[def-integer-power]],
  [[def-rational-power]]), never a real.
- The two indexings are related by $\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k = \sum_{k < n+1} a_k$, so
  a statement proved for one is available for the other. Sums over $k < n$ are
  the primitive form here because $\Sigma_0$, the empty sum, is then the base
  case of every induction, and no index outside $\mathbb{N}$ is ever needed.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $m \in \mathbb{R}$.

- $m$ is a **maximum** (or *greatest element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $s \le m$
  for every $s \in S$.
- $m$ is a **minimum** (or *least element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $m \le s$
  for every $s \in S$.

A set has at most one maximum: if $m_1$ and $m_2$ are both maxima then
$m_1 \in S$ gives $m_1 \le m_2$ and $m_2 \in S$ gives $m_2 \le m_1$, so
$m_1 = m_2$ by antisymmetry of the order, which is immediate from the trichotomy
axiom of an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).
The same argument applies to minima, so we may write $\max S$ and $\min S$.

## Remarks

- A maximum is precisely an upper bound of $S$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]])
  that happens to lie in $S$; a minimum is a lower bound of $S$
  ([[def-bounded-set]]) that lies in $S$. In particular a set with a maximum is
  bounded above and a set with a minimum is bounded below.
- The empty set has neither a maximum nor a minimum, because the requirement
  $m \in S$ cannot be met.
- The membership requirement $m \in S$ is exactly what separates a maximum from a
  supremum, and it is the theme of this page. A supremum is a bound on the set
  and is not asked to belong to it; a maximum is an element of the set. The two
  agree exactly when the supremum happens to be attained ([[lem-max-is-sup]]),
  and they genuinely differ in general ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has both a maximum and a minimum
  ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]), which is what licenses the notation
  $\max\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$. Infinite sets need not: the failure of attainment is
  an infinitary phenomenon.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]). Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and let
$f : A \to \mathbb{R}$. Then $f$ is:

- **nondecreasing** when $f(x) \le f(y)$ for all $x, y \in A$ with $x \le y$;
- **increasing**, or *strictly increasing*, when $f(x) < f(y)$ for all
  $x, y \in A$ with $x < y$;
- **nonincreasing** when $f(x) \ge f(y)$ for all $x, y \in A$ with $x \le y$;
- **decreasing**, or *strictly decreasing*, when $f(x) > f(y)$ for all
  $x, y \in A$ with $x < y$;
- **monotone** when it is nondecreasing or nonincreasing;
- **strictly monotone** when it is increasing or decreasing.

The naming follows the convention of [[def-monotone-sequence]], which is the
convention of this library throughout: *increasing* is the strict notion and
*nondecreasing* the weak one.

**An increasing function is nondecreasing, and a decreasing function is
nonincreasing.** For $x \le y$ either $x < y$, and then $f(x) < f(y)$, hence
$f(x) \le f(y)$; or $x = y$, and then $f(x) = f(y)$. The same argument with the
inequalities reversed gives the second claim. So strictly monotone implies
monotone.

**A strictly monotone function is injective**
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]). Let $f$ be increasing and let
$x, y \in A$ with $x \ne y$. By trichotomy either $x < y$, and then
$f(x) < f(y)$, or $y < x$, and then $f(y) < f(x)$; in both cases
$f(x) \ne f(y)$. The decreasing case is the same argument. The converse fails,
and the failure is not exotic: a continuous injection on an interval *is*
strictly monotone ([[thm-continuous-injection-on-an-interval-is-strictly-monotone]]),
but on a domain that is not an interval it need not be.

**Negation exchanges the two directions.** For $g := -f$, that is
$g(x) := -f(x)$, the four conditions above are exchanged in pairs: $f$ is
nondecreasing exactly when $g$ is nonincreasing, and $f$ is increasing exactly
when $g$ is decreasing, because $u \le v$ holds exactly when $-v \le -u$
([[def-ordered-field]]). Several proofs below use this to reduce a nonincreasing
case to a nondecreasing one.

**Monotone on a set, not at a point.** All six conditions are conditions on the
whole of $A$; unlike continuity ([[def-continuity-real]]) there is no pointwise
version, and none is used in this library. The domain $A$ is an arbitrary subset
of $\mathbb{R}$; where a result needs $A$ to be an interval
([[def-interval]]) it says so, and the hypothesis is never decoration.

### The dictionary to monotone sequences

A sequence of reals is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$
([[def-sequence]]), and [[def-monotone-sequence]] calls it nondecreasing when
$x_j \le x_k$ for all $j \le k$, increasing when $x_j < x_k$ for all $j < k$,
and so on. Those are **the same four conditions as above**, read with the
ordered set $\mathbb{N}$ in place of the ordered subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$
and with the comparison of indices in place of the comparison of arguments. So
nothing new is introduced here for sequences, and the two vocabularies may be
used interchangeably: the words *nondecreasing*, *increasing*, *nonincreasing*,
*decreasing*, *monotone* and *strictly monotone* mean the corresponding
condition on the domain at hand.

One consequence is used repeatedly, and it has to be stated carefully because
composition does **not** simply preserve the four words. Let $(x_k)$ be a
**nondecreasing** sequence with $x_k \in A$ for every $k$, so that $j \le k$ gives
$x_j \le x_k$. Then:

- if $f$ is nondecreasing, $(f(x_k))$ is nondecreasing, since $f(x_j) \le f(x_k)$;
- if $f$ is nonincreasing, $(f(x_k))$ is **nonincreasing**, since
  $f(x_j) \ge f(x_k)$.

So along a nondecreasing sequence the composite inherits the direction of $f$;
and with $(x_k)$ increasing and $f$ increasing, $(f(x_k))$ is increasing, while
with $(x_k)$ increasing and $f$ decreasing, $(f(x_k))$ is decreasing.

**Along a nonincreasing sequence the direction is reversed, not inherited.** If
$(x_k)$ is nonincreasing and $f$ is nonincreasing, then $j \le k$ gives
$x_j \ge x_k$ and hence $f(x_j) \le f(x_k)$: the composite is **nondecreasing**.
The witness is $f(x) = -x$ on $A = \mathbb{R}$ with $x_k = -k$, where both $f$ and
$(x_k)$ are decreasing and $f(x_k) = k$ is increasing. Two order-reversing maps
compose to an order-preserving one, exactly as for the four words applied to
functions.

## Definition

Let $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with open sets as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

- An **open cover** of $K$ is a family $\mathcal{U}$ of open subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$ with $K \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{U}$.
- A **subcover** of $\mathcal{U}$ is a subfamily $\mathcal{V} \subseteq
  \mathcal{U}$ that is still an open cover of $K$.
- A subfamily $\mathcal{V} \subseteq \mathcal{U}$ is **finite** when
  $\mathcal{V} = \varnothing$ or there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and members
  $U_0, \dots, U_n$ of $\mathcal{U}$ with $\mathcal{V} = \{U_0, \dots, U_n\}$;
  repetitions in the list are allowed and harmless.
- $K$ is **compact** when every open cover of $K$ has a finite subcover:
  for every open cover $\mathcal{U}$ of $K$, either $K = \varnothing$ and the
  empty subfamily covers it, or there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
  $U_0, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{U}$ with
  $$K \subseteq U_0 \cup \dots \cup U_n .$$
- $K$ is **sequentially compact** when every sequence $(x_k)$ of reals with
  $x_k \in K$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-sequence]]) has a subsequence
  converging ([[def-real-limit]]) to some point of $K$; equivalently, when every
  such sequence has a subsequential limit ([[def-subsequential-limit]]) that
  lies in $K$.

**Compactness is a property of $K$ alone.** The covering families range over open
subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, not over sets open in some other ambient space, so the
notion defined here is compactness of $K$ as a subset of $\mathbb{R}$. Nothing
below relativises it to a smaller ambient field; where an ordered field other
than $\mathbb{R}$ is meant, as in
[[fs-closed-bounded-compact-without-completeness]], the whole vocabulary is set
up again there for that field.

**$\varnothing$ is compact and sequentially compact.** The empty subfamily covers
it, and there is no sequence with all terms in $\varnothing$, so both conditions
hold vacuously.

## Remarks

- **Why "finite" is spelled out by listing.** A finite subfamily is described
  here as one that can be written $\{U_0, \dots, U_n\}$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}$,
  which is exactly the form every proof on this page produces or consumes: the
  bisection argument of [[thm-heine-borel-r]] produces a one-member list, and
  the arguments of [[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]] consume a list by
  taking a maximum over it ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]). Since $\mathbb{N}$
  contains $0$, the shortest nonempty list is $\{U_0\}$.

- **The two notions are not defined to be equivalent, and their equivalence is a
  theorem.** For subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ it is
  [[thm-compact-iff-sequentially-compact-r]]; both of its implications run
  through the characterisation of compactness by closed and bounded, and its
  forward implication additionally uses Bolzano-Weierstrass. Neither implication
  is formal.

- **Compactness is not inherited by subsets, but by closed subsets.** A closed
  subset of a compact set is compact, which is immediate from
  [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]] once that is available, whereas
  $(0,1) \subseteq [0,1]$ shows that an arbitrary subset of a compact set need
  not be compact.

- **The empty cover.** If $K \ne \varnothing$ then no open cover of $K$ is
  empty, so the case distinction in the definition of compactness only ever
  matters for $K = \varnothing$; it is written out so that the definition does
  not quietly assume $K$ nonempty.

## Definition

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ ([[def-field]]) together with a subset
$P \subseteq F$, the set of **positive** elements (the *positive cone*),
satisfying:

- **(O1) Trichotomy.** For each $x \in F$, exactly one of the following holds:
  $x \in P$, or $x = 0$, or $-x \in P$.
- **(O2) Closure.** If $x, y \in P$ then $x + y \in P$ and $x \cdot y \in P$.

We write $x > 0$ for $x \in P$ (read "$x$ is positive"), and define the order by

$$a < b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; b - a \in P, \qquad a \le b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; a < b \text{ or } a = b.$$

Thus $a > b$ means $b < a$, and $a \ge b$ means $b \le a$. An element $x$ with
$-x \in P$ (equivalently $x < 0$) is called **negative**.

## Remarks

- By trichotomy applied to $b - a$, for any $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$,
  $a = b$, $a > b$ holds; this makes $\le$ a total order.
- (O2) says the positives are closed under addition and multiplication: sums and
  products of positives are positive.
- The rationals ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and both constructions of the reals
  ([[thm-reals-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-dedekind-ordered-field]]) are ordered
  fields, so every fact proved here from (O1)-(O2) holds in each of them.

## Definition

**Why this item is first.** The published definition of the integral does not
cover this page. [[def-darboux-integral]] is stated for reals $a < b$, because
the partitions it quantifies over are those of [[def-partition-and-refinement]],
whose standing hypothesis is $a < b$: with $a = b$ the chain
$a = t_0 < \dots < t_n = b$ is unsatisfiable. So $\int_a^b f$ is an undefined
symbol whenever $a \ge b$, and every additivity statement below would be
ill-formed as it is usually written. This item extends the notation, and nothing
else: the object it names is still the Darboux integral of
[[def-darboux-integral]].

Let $u, v \in \mathbb{R}$ and write

$$[u \wedge v,\ u \vee v] \;:=\; \text{the closed interval with endpoints } u \text{ and } v$$

([[def-interval]]). Let $f$ be a real-valued function whose domain contains that
interval. Say that **$f$ is integrable between $u$ and $v$** when either $u = v$,
or $u \ne v$ and the restriction of $f$ to $[u \wedge v,\ u \vee v]$ is bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]) and Darboux integrable there ([[def-darboux-integral]],
[[def-darboux-sums]]). For such $f$ define

$$\int_u^v f \;:=\; \begin{cases} \text{the Darboux integral of } f \text{ over } [u,v] & \text{if } u < v, \\[2pt] 0 & \text{if } u = v, \\[2pt] -\displaystyle\int_v^u f & \text{if } u > v. \end{cases}$$

**There is nothing to check for consistency.** The three clauses are indexed by
the three cases of trichotomy, $u < v$, $u = v$ and $u > v$, which are mutually
exclusive and exhaustive; no pair of them ever applies to the same $(u,v)$. In
particular the first clause is untouched, so on $u < v$ this is the published
integral verbatim and every published theorem about it applies unchanged.

**The middle clause is a stipulation, not a computation.** It is *not* claimed
that $0$ is a value forced by the $u < v$ definition in any limiting sense; that
definition simply says nothing at $u = v$, and $\int_u^u f := 0$ is what is
written there. It is also unconditional: no hypothesis on $f$ beyond being
defined at $u$ is asked for, since the case $u = v$ never refers to a partition.

### The two consequences used throughout the page

**Antisymmetry, for every pair.** For all reals $u, v$ with $f$ integrable
between them,

$$\int_u^v f \;=\; -\int_v^u f .$$

Indeed if $u < v$ then $v > u$ and the third clause reads
$\int_v^u f = -\int_u^v f$, which rearranges to the display; if $u = v$ both
sides are $0$; and if $u > v$ the third clause is the display itself.

**Absolute values agree.** Consequently
$\bigl|\int_u^v f\bigr| = \bigl|\int_v^u f\bigr|$ for every such pair.

**An obligation recorded here and discharged elsewhere.** With this convention
the additivity identity

$$\int_u^v f \;+\; \int_v^w f \;=\; \int_u^w f$$

holds for **every** arrangement of $u, v, w$ in an interval on which $f$ is
integrable, not only for $u < v < w$. That is a theorem and not part of this
definition; it is proved as the last clause of
[[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]], and nothing on this page uses it before it
is proved there.

## Remarks

- **This is notation, and it is a real notation.** Without it the substitution
  theorem could not be stated with the limits $\varphi(c)$ and $\varphi(d)$ in
  the order the map produces them, since a differentiable $\varphi$ need be
  neither injective nor monotone; and the integral function $x \mapsto \int_a^x f$
  would be undefined at $x = a$.

- **One published inequality is not orientation-invariant, and that is a trap.**
  The estimate $\bigl|\int_u^v f\bigr| \le \int_u^v |f|$ is guaranteed only
  for $u \le v$: at $u > v$ the right-hand side is $-\int_v^u |f| \le 0$ while
  the left-hand side is $\ge 0$, so the inequality fails whenever
  $\int_v^u |f| > 0$. The form valid for every pair is
  $\bigl|\int_u^v f\bigr| \le \bigl|\int_u^v |f|\bigr|$, and this is stated where
  it is proved ([[cor-integrability-of-absolute-values-products-and-lattice-operations]]).

- **Integrability is a property of the unordered pair.** By construction, $f$ is
  integrable between $u$ and $v$ if and only if it is integrable between $v$ and
  $u$, since both refer to the same closed interval; only the sign of the value
  remembers the order.

## Definition

**Standing hypothesis for this page.** Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete
ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]),
$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers and **contains $0$**
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[def-nat-order]]), $\iota : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$
is the canonical natural ([[def-canonical-natural]]), and $a, b$ are reals with

$$a \;<\; b .$$

Intervals and their lengths are those of [[def-interval]]; finite sums are those
of [[def-finite-sum]], indexed as $\sum_{i<n}$ over $i \in \mathbb{N}$.

### Partitions

A **partition of $[a,b]$** is a pair $P = (n, t)$ consisting of a natural number
$n \ge 1$ and a sequence $t : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-sequence]]) with

$$t_0 = a, \qquad t_i < t_{i+1} \ \text{ for every } i < n, \qquad t_k = b \ \text{ for every } k \ge n .$$

The tail convention on the third clause is bookkeeping only: it makes $t$ a
genuine sequence, so that the finite-sum laws of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] apply to
it verbatim, and it costs nothing because no index above $n$ is ever read. The
first two clauses say exactly that

$$a \;=\; t_0 \;<\; t_1 \;<\; \dots \;<\; t_n \;=\; b ,$$

the last equality because $t_n = b$ by the third clause. In particular
$i \mapsto t_i$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on
$\{\, i \in \mathbb{N} : i \le n \,\}$ ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]),
and $a \le t_i \le b$ for every $i \le n$.

The **point set** of $P$ is the finite set

$$\operatorname{pts}(P) \;:=\; \{\, t_i \ : \ i \le n \,\} \;\subseteq\; [a,b], \qquad a, b \in \operatorname{pts}(P) .$$

The **subintervals** of $P$ are

$$I_i \;:=\; [\,t_i,\ t_{i+1}\,] \qquad (i < n),$$

and their **lengths** are $\Delta_i := t_{i+1} - t_i$. Each $\Delta_i > 0$, so
each $I_i$ is a nondegenerate closed bounded interval ([[def-interval]]). There
are $n$ of them and they are indexed from $i = 0$, not from $i = 1$: the first
subinterval is $[t_0, t_1] = [a, t_1]$.

**The lengths sum to $b - a$.** By the telescoping law, clause 5 of
[[lem-finite-sum-laws]],

$$\sum_{i<n} \Delta_i \;=\; \sum_{i<n} (t_{i+1} - t_i) \;=\; t_n - t_0 \;=\; b - a .$$

**The mesh.** The set $\{\, \Delta_i : i < n \,\}$ is a nonempty finite set of
reals, nonempty because $n \ge 1$, so it has a maximum
([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]). The **mesh** of $P$ is

$$\|P\| \;:=\; \max\{\, \Delta_i \ : \ i < n \,\} \;>\; 0 ,$$

and $\Delta_i \le \|P\|$ for every $i < n$.

**The uniform partition.** For a natural $N \ge 1$, the **uniform partition of
$[a,b]$ into $N$ parts** is $U_N := (N, t)$ with

$$t_i \;:=\; a + \iota(i)\,\frac{b-a}{\iota(N)} \quad (i \le N), \qquad t_k := b \quad (k \ge N).$$

This is a partition: $t_0 = a$; $t_N = a + (b-a) = b$; and $t_{i+1} - t_i =
(b-a)/\iota(N) > 0$ for $i < N$, because $\iota(N) > 0$ and $\iota(i+1) =
\iota(i) + 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[def-canonical-natural]]). Its
subinterval lengths are all equal to $(b-a)/\iota(N)$, so

$$\|U_N\| \;=\; \frac{b-a}{\iota(N)} .$$

### A partition is determined by its point set

**Claim.** If $P = (n,t)$ and $P' = (n', t')$ are partitions of $[a,b]$ with
$\operatorname{pts}(P) = \operatorname{pts}(P')$, then $n = n'$ and $t_i = t'_i$
for every $i \le n$.

*Proof.* First, $t_i = t'_i$ for every $i \le \min\{n,n'\}$, by induction on $i$
([[thm-induction-principle]]). For $i = 0$ both equal $a$. Suppose $t_j = t'_j$
for all $j \le i$ and $i + 1 \le \min\{n,n'\}$. The set
$S := \{\, x \in \operatorname{pts}(P) : x > t_i \,\}$ has $t_{i+1}$ as its least
element: $t_{i+1} \in S$, and any $x \in S$ is $t_j$ for some $j \le n$ with
$t_j > t_i$, which forces $j > i$ because $t$ is increasing on indices $\le n$,
hence $j \ge i+1$ and $x = t_j \ge t_{i+1}$. The same argument in $P'$ makes
$t'_{i+1}$ the least element of
$\{\, x \in \operatorname{pts}(P') : x > t'_i \,\}$, which is the same set $S$,
since the point sets agree and $t'_i = t_i$. A set has at most one least element
([[def-max-min]]), so $t_{i+1} = t'_{i+1}$.

Second, $n = n'$. If $n < n'$ then $t'_n = t_n = b$ by the previous paragraph,
while $t'_n < t'_{n'} = b$ because $t'$ is increasing on indices $\le n'$ and
$n < n'$; that is impossible. Exchanging the roles of $P$ and $P'$ rules out
$n' < n$. $\square$

So the map $P \mapsto \operatorname{pts}(P)$ is injective, and a partition may be
named by its point set whenever one is exhibited.

### Inserting a point

Let $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ and let $c \in [a,b]$. Define a
partition $P + c$ of $[a,b]$ as follows.

- If $c \in \operatorname{pts}(P)$, put $P + c := P$.
- Otherwise $c \ne a$ and $c \ne b$, so $a < c < b$. The set
  $T := \{\, t_i : i \le n \text{ and } t_i < c \,\}$ is a nonempty finite set of
  reals, nonempty because $t_0 = a < c$, so it has a maximum
  ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]); let $i_0 \le n$ be the unique index with
  $t_{i_0} = \max T$, unique because $t$ is injective on indices $\le n$. Then
  $i_0 < n$, since $t_n = b > c$ puts $t_n \notin T$; and
  $$t_{i_0} \;<\; c \;<\; t_{i_0+1},$$
  the right inequality because $t_{i_0+1} \ne c$ (as $c \notin \operatorname{pts}(P)$)
  and $t_{i_0+1} < c$ would put $t_{i_0+1} \in T$ with $t_{i_0+1} > t_{i_0} = \max T$.
  Put $P + c := (n+1, s)$ with
  $$s_i := t_i \ (i \le i_0), \qquad s_{i_0+1} := c, \qquad s_i := t_{i-1} \ (i_0 + 2 \le i \le n+1), \qquad s_k := b \ (k \ge n+1).$$

In both cases $P + c$ is a partition of $[a,b]$ and

$$\operatorname{pts}(P + c) \;=\; \operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \{c\}, \qquad \|P+c\| \;\le\; \|P\| .$$

The displayed identity is immediate from the two cases. For the mesh: in the
first case nothing changes; in the second the list of subinterval lengths of
$P + c$ is that of $P$ with $\Delta_{i_0}$ replaced by the two numbers
$c - t_{i_0}$ and $t_{i_0+1} - c$, each of which is smaller than
$\Delta_{i_0} = (c - t_{i_0}) + (t_{i_0+1} - c)$ because the other is positive.
So every length of $P + c$ is at most a length of $P$, and the maximum cannot
increase. Finally the index count grows by exactly $1$ in the second case and
not at all in the first.

### Refinement and the common refinement

$P'$ **refines** $P$, and is a **refinement** of $P$, when

$$\operatorname{pts}(P) \;\subseteq\; \operatorname{pts}(P') .$$

Let $P = (n,t)$ and $Q = (m,s)$ be partitions of $[a,b]$. Applying the recursion
theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) to the set $\mathbb{N} \times \mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$,
where $\mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$ is the set of partitions of $[a,b]$, with starting
element $(0, P)$ and the map $(j, R) \mapsto (j+1,\ R + s_j)$ — legitimate
because $s_j \in [a,b]$ for every $j \in \mathbb{N}$ — gives a unique family
$(R_j)_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ of partitions with $R_0 = P$ and $R_{j+1} = R_j + s_j$.
The **common refinement** of $P$ and $Q$ is

$$P \vee Q \;:=\; R_{m+1} .$$

**Its point set is the union.** By induction on $j$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]),
$\operatorname{pts}(R_j) = \operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \{\, s_l : l < j \,\}$;
taking $j = m+1$ gives

$$\operatorname{pts}(P \vee Q) \;=\; \operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \operatorname{pts}(Q).$$

Hence $P \vee Q$ refines both $P$ and $Q$; by the uniqueness claim above it is
the **only** partition with that point set, so $P \vee Q = Q \vee P$, and

$$P' \text{ refines } P \quad \Longrightarrow \quad P \vee P' = P' ,$$

since then $\operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \operatorname{pts}(P') =
\operatorname{pts}(P')$.

**Two size bounds, both used later.** Writing $n_R$ for the first component of a
partition $R$:

$$\|P \vee Q\| \;\le\; \|P\|, \qquad n_{P \vee Q} \;\le\; n_P + n_Q - 1 .$$

The first is the mesh bound above applied $m+1$ times. For the second, each
insertion raises the index count by at most $1$, and the two insertions of
$s_0 = a$ and $s_m = b$ raise it by $0$, since $a$ and $b$ already lie in
$\operatorname{pts}(P)$ and hence in $\operatorname{pts}(R_j)$ for every $j$; so
at most $m - 1$ of the $m+1$ insertions increase it.

### The index map of a refinement

Let $P' = (n',t')$ refine $P = (n,t)$. For each $i \le n$ the point $t_i$ lies in
$\operatorname{pts}(P')$, so there is exactly one $\varphi(i) \le n'$ with
$t'_{\varphi(i)} = t_i$, uniqueness because $t'$ is injective on indices $\le n'$.
The resulting map $\varphi$ satisfies

$$\varphi(0) = 0, \qquad \varphi(n) = n', \qquad \varphi(i) < \varphi(i+1) \ \ (i < n),$$

the first two because $t'_0 = a = t_0$ and $t'_{n'} = b = t_n$ together with
injectivity, and the third because $t_i < t_{i+1}$ and $t'$ is increasing on
indices $\le n'$. In particular $n \le n'$. Moreover, for $i < n$ and
$\varphi(i) \le j < \varphi(i+1)$,

$$I'_j \;=\; [\,t'_j,\ t'_{j+1}\,] \;\subseteq\; [\,t_i,\ t_{i+1}\,] \;=\; I_i ,$$

because $t_i = t'_{\varphi(i)} \le t'_j$ and $t'_{j+1} \le t'_{\varphi(i+1)} = t_{i+1}$.

**The blocks are counted by telescoping.** By clause 5 of
[[lem-finite-sum-laws]],
$\sum_{i<n}\big(\varphi(i+1) - \varphi(i)\big) = \varphi(n) - \varphi(0) = n'$,
so, subtracting $\sum_{i<n} 1 = n$,

$$\sum_{i<n} \big(\varphi(i+1) - \varphi(i) - 1\big) \;=\; n' - n ,$$

a sum of $n$ nonnegative integers, one for each block, which vanishes exactly at
the blocks consisting of a single index. This identity is the whole content of
the quantitative bound in [[lem-refinement-inequalities]], and it is also why
$n \le n'$.

Finally, the lengths inside a block sum to the length of the block:

$$\sum_{j = \varphi(i)}^{\varphi(i+1)-1} \Delta'_j \;=\; t'_{\varphi(i+1)} - t'_{\varphi(i)} \;=\; t_{i+1} - t_i \;=\; \Delta_i \qquad (i < n),$$

again by telescoping, applied to the sequence $l \mapsto t'_{\varphi(i)+l}$ and
read through the index-shift convention of [[def-finite-sum]].

## Remarks

- **Why $a < b$ is a standing hypothesis and not a case.** With $a = b$ the
  displayed chain $a = t_0 < \dots < t_n = b$ is unsatisfiable for $n \ge 1$, and
  admitting $n = 0$ would give a partition with no subintervals, an empty mesh
  set and no maximum. Every statement on this page is about a nondegenerate
  closed bounded interval, and the convention $\int_a^a f := 0$ is not adopted
  here because nothing below needs it.

- **The subintervals overlap at their shared endpoints, and that is harmless.**
  $I_i \cap I_{i+1} = \{t_{i+1}\}$, so the union $\bigcup_{i<n} I_i = [a,b]$ is
  not disjoint. Every quantity attached to a partition below is a sum over $i<n$
  of a number times $\Delta_i$, and a single point contributes length $0$, so no
  statement on this page is sensitive to the double counting of the $n-1$
  interior points.

- **Refinement is a relation between point sets, not between lists.** Defining it
  as "$P'$ is obtained from $P$ by inserting points" would be the same relation,
  by the uniqueness claim above, but it would make every proof carry an
  insertion order. The index map $\varphi$ recovers the list-level picture when
  it is wanted, and it is what [[lem-refinement-inequalities]] actually uses.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-real-numbers]]) and
a **sequence of reals** is a function $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$
([[def-sequence]]), written $(a_k)$; recall that $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$.

**Partial sums.** Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals. Its **sequence of partial
sums** is

$$s_n \;:=\; \sum_{k < n} a_k \qquad (n \in \mathbb{N}),$$

the finite sum of [[def-finite-sum]]. In particular $s_0 = 0$, the empty sum, and
$s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ for every $n$, those being exactly the two recursion clauses
that define the finite sum. Note that $s_n$ is the sum of the $n$ terms
$a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$, so the index $n$ counts terms rather than naming the last
one.

**Convergence, the sum, divergence.** The **series** of $(a_k)$, written
$\sum a_k$, **converges** when the sequence $(s_n)$ of partial sums converges
([[def-real-limit]]), and then the **sum of the series** is

$$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k \;:=\; \lim_{n} s_n .$$

The series **diverges** when $(s_n)$ does not converge. A convergent sequence of
reals has exactly one limit ([[lem-limit-unique]]), so the displayed symbol names
a single real number and nothing further has to be checked for it to be
well defined.

**Series with a general starting index.** Let $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $a$ be a
function on $\{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : k \ge m \,\}$, which we call a **family from
$m$** and write $(a_k)_{k \ge m}$. The series

$$\sum_{k \ge m} a_k$$

is by definition the series of the sequence $b_j := a_{j + m}$,
$j \in \mathbb{N}$, which is a genuine sequence of reals; it converges exactly
when that series converges, and its sum is then written
$\sum_{k = m}^{\infty} a_k$. Its partial sums are

$$\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k \;=\; \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j} \qquad (n \ge m),$$

in the notation of [[def-finite-sum]], the value at $n = m$ being the empty sum
$0$. A sequence on $\mathbb{N}$ is the case $m = 0$, and the two readings of
$\sum a_k$ agree there, since $b_j = a_j$.

**This clause is not a convenience.** Sequences in this library are functions on
$\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$ ([[def-sequence]]), while many of the
classical series are built from expressions that are undefined at the index $0$:
$1/k$, $1/k^{p}$ and $|a_k|^{1/k}$ all require $k \ge 1$. Writing such a series as
$\sum_{k \ge 1} a_k$ names an honest object, whereas writing it as a sequence on
$\mathbb{N}$ would require a value at an index where the defining expression has
none. Every statement on this page says which starting index it uses.

**Tail series.** For $N \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$N$-th tail series** of
$\sum a_k$ is $\sum_{k \ge N} a_k$, that is the series of the $N$-th tail
$a^{(N)}$ of [[def-sequence]], whose terms are $a^{(N)}_j = a_{j+N}$. The
$0$-th tail series is the series itself.

## Remarks

- **"Diverges" here means "does not converge", and nothing more.** A divergent
  series may have partial sums that run away to $+\infty$, or to $-\infty$, or
  that oscillate without settling anywhere. The three behaviours are not
  distinguished by the word, and no statement on this page uses "diverges" to
  mean "the partial sums are unbounded" unless it says so.

- **The symbol $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k$ is defined only for a convergent
  series.** It denotes a real number, not a formal object, and it is illegitimate
  to write it down before convergence has been established. Where a proof needs
  to speak of the series without knowing whether it converges, it speaks of
  $(a_k)$ and of $(s_n)$.

- **Two indices, doing different work.** The index $k$ runs over the terms and is
  bound; the index $n$ runs over the partial sums and is the variable in which the
  limit is taken. Confusing them is the commonest slip in the subject, and it is
  the reason the definition above fixes $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ rather than
  $\sum_{k \le n} a_k$: with this choice the recursion $s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ is
  the one supplied by [[def-finite-sum]], with no shift anywhere.

## Definition

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]). The **integral function of $f$ with base point $a$**
is

$$F : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad F(x) \;:=\; \int_a^x f .$$

**It is a genuine function, and that has to be checked.** For $x \in (a,b]$ the
restriction of $f$ to $[a,x]$ is integrable, by
[[lem-integrability-on-a-subinterval]] applied with $c := a$ and $d := x$, so
$\int_a^x f$ names a single real number ([[def-darboux-integral]]). For $x = a$
the symbol $\int_a^a f$ is $0$ by [[def-oriented-integral]]. So $F(x)$ is defined
at every point of $[a,b]$ and

$$F(a) \;=\; 0 .$$

More generally, for any base point $c \in [a,b]$ the function
$x \mapsto \int_c^x f$ is defined on the whole of $[a,b]$, the integral being the
oriented one of [[def-oriented-integral]] when $x < c$; the case $c = a$ is
written $F$ above and is the one used unless another base point is named.

### The two identities used throughout

**Increments are integrals.** For all $x, y \in [a,b]$, in either order,

$$F(y) - F(x) \;=\; \int_x^y f .$$

This is claim 3 of [[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]] applied to the three
points $a$, $x$, $y$: it gives $\int_a^x f + \int_x^y f = \int_a^y f$, that is
$F(x) + \int_x^y f = F(y)$. No ordering of $x$ and $y$ is assumed, and the
degenerate cases $x = y$, $x = a$ and $y = a$ are included, since claim 3 is
stated for arbitrary points.

**Changing the base point changes $F$ by a constant.** If $c \in [a,b]$ and
$F_c(x) := \int_c^x f$, then for every $x \in [a,b]$

$$F_c(x) \;=\; F(x) - F(c) ,$$

again by claim 3 of [[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]] at the points $a$, $c$,
$x$. So the family of integral functions of $f$ is one function up to an
additive constant.

## Remarks

- **$F$ exists for every integrable $f$, whether or not $f$ has a primitive.**
  Nothing in the definition asks $f$ to be continuous anywhere, and nothing here
  claims $F' = f$. The two statements about $F'$ that this page does prove are: $F$ is
  always Lipschitz ([[thm-the-integral-function-is-lipschitz]]), and $F'(c) = f(c)$
  at every point $c$ where $f$ is continuous ([[thm-ftc-first-part]]).

- **$F$ need not be a primitive of $f$.** At a discontinuity of $f$ the
  derivative $F'$ may fail to exist, or may exist and differ from $f$; both
  possibilities are exhibited on the companion page, by
  [[cex-an-integrable-function-with-no-primitive]] and
  [[fs-the-integral-function-is-always-a-primitive]]. That is the honest content
  of the phrase "the integral function", and it is why it is not called "the
  primitive" here.

- **Why the base point is part of the data and the notation suppresses it.** The
  symbol $F$ hides its dependence on $a$, as is customary; the identity
  $F_c = F - F(c)$ above is what makes the suppression harmless, since every
  statement below about $F$ is about its increments, which do not see the base
  point at all.

## Statement

Let $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ be sequences of reals and let

$$A_n \;:=\; \sum_{k<n} a_k \qquad (n \in \mathbb{N})$$

be the partial sums of $\sum a_k$ ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]]), so that
$A_0 = 0$ and $a_k = A_{k+1} - A_k$ for every $k$. Then for every natural number
$n \ge 1$

$$\sum_{k<n} a_k b_k \;=\; A_n\, b_{n-1} \;-\; \sum_{k<n-1} A_{k+1}\,(b_{k+1} - b_k) .$$

Both sides are finite sums in the sense of [[def-finite-sum]]; at $n = 1$ the
right-hand sum is empty and the identity reads $a_0 b_0 = A_1 b_0$.

**The hypothesis $n \ge 1$ is what makes the statement legitimate**, not merely
convenient: the index $n-1$ occurs on the right, and $n-1$ is a natural number
exactly when $n \ge 1$. At $n = 0$ there is nothing to state, both the left-hand
side and $A_0$ being $0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ of reals and the partial sums $A_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ ([[def-series]]).

[L1] Finite sums are defined by the recursion $\sum_{k<0} x_k = 0$ and $\sum_{k<n+1} x_k = \sum_{k<n} x_k + x_n$ ([[def-finite-sum]]).

[L2] The partial sums satisfy $A_0 = 0$ and $A_{n+1} = A_n + a_n$ for every $n$, those being the two clauses of [L1] applied to $(a_k)$ ([[def-series]]).

[L3] Finite sums are additive and may be split at any intermediate index ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L4] The principle of induction on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 The claim to be proved by induction is the statement $P(m)$: the displayed identity holds at $n = m+1$, that is $\sum_{k<m+1} a_k b_k = A_{m+1} b_m - \sum_{k<m} A_{k+1}(b_{k+1} - b_k)$. Every $n \ge 1$ is $m+1$ for exactly one $m \in \mathbb{N}$, so proving $P(m)$ for all $m$ proves the lemma. [L4]

1.2 $P(0)$ holds: the left-hand side is $\sum_{k<1} a_k b_k = a_0 b_0$ by [L1], while $A_1 = A_0 + a_0 = a_0$ by [L2] and $\sum_{k<0} A_{k+1}(b_{k+1}-b_k) = 0$ by [L1], so the right-hand side is $a_0 b_0 - 0$. [L1, L2, base]

1.3 Assume $P(m)$ for a fixed $m \in \mathbb{N}$. [ih]

1.4 By [L1], $\sum_{k<m+2} a_k b_k = \sum_{k<m+1} a_k b_k + a_{m+1} b_{m+1}$. [L1]

1.5 By [L1], $\sum_{k<m+1} A_{k+1}(b_{k+1} - b_k) = \sum_{k<m} A_{k+1}(b_{k+1} - b_k) + A_{m+1}(b_{m+1} - b_m)$. [L1, L3]

1.6 By [L2], $A_{m+2} = A_{m+1} + a_{m+1}$, so $a_{m+1} = A_{m+2} - A_{m+1}$. [L2]

2.1 Substituting the induction hypothesis into step 1.4 gives $\sum_{k<m+2} a_k b_k = A_{m+1} b_m - \sum_{k<m} A_{k+1}(b_{k+1}-b_k) + a_{m+1} b_{m+1}$. [step 1.3, step 1.4]

2.2 Using step 1.6, $A_{m+1} b_m + a_{m+1} b_{m+1} = A_{m+1} b_m + A_{m+2} b_{m+1} - A_{m+1} b_{m+1} = A_{m+2} b_{m+1} - A_{m+1}(b_{m+1} - b_m)$. [step 1.6, algebra]

3.1 Combining step 2.1 and step 2.2 and then step 1.5 gives $\sum_{k<m+2} a_k b_k = A_{m+2} b_{m+1} - A_{m+1}(b_{m+1}-b_m) - \sum_{k<m} A_{k+1}(b_{k+1}-b_k) = A_{m+2} b_{m+1} - \sum_{k<m+1} A_{k+1}(b_{k+1}-b_k)$, which is $P(m+1)$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 1.5, algebra]

4.1 By [L4] applied to step 1.2 and step 3.1, $P(m)$ holds for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$, that is, the displayed identity holds for every $n \ge 1$. [step 1.2, step 3.1, L4, discharge-induction] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the identity is for.** It converts a series $\sum a_k b_k$, about which nothing is assumed, into a boundary term $A_n b_{n-1}$ and a series $\sum A_{k+1}(b_{k+1} - b_k)$ whose terms carry the *differences* of $(b_k)$. If $(A_n)$ is bounded and $(b_k)$ is monotone, those differences have one sign and telescope, which is exactly the situation of [[thm-dirichlet-test]]. The transformation is the discrete analogue of integration by parts, and the boundary term is the analogue of the boundary term there.

- **The block form needs no separate proof.** For $1 \le M \le n$, subtracting the identity at $M$ from the identity at $n$ gives $\sum_{k=M}^{n-1} a_k b_k = A_n b_{n-1} - A_M b_{M-1} - \sum_{k=M-1}^{n-2} A_{k+1}(b_{k+1}-b_k)$, using only splitting of finite sums ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]). Nothing on this page needs that form, so it is recorded here rather than stated as a result.

- **Two conventions are doing work.** $A_n$ sums the $n$ terms $a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$, so $A_0 = 0$ and $a_k = A_{k+1} - A_k$ with no shift ([[def-series]]); and the empty sum is $0$ ([[def-finite-sum]]), which is what makes $n = 1$ a genuine instance of the identity rather than a case to be excluded.

## Statement

Let $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be sequences of reals, let
$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, and let $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, with finite sums and
finite products as in [[def-finite-sum]]. Then:

1. **Additivity.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k$.
2. **Scaling.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k$; in particular $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda = n\lambda$, where $n$ denotes the canonical natural $\iota(n) \in \mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).
3. **Splitting.** If $m \le n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k$, and $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n} a_k = \Big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k\Big)$.
4. **Monotonicity.** If $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$. In particular, if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, every single term satisfies $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$ for $j < n$, and $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ forces $a_k = 0$ for every $k < n$.
5. **Telescoping.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}\big(c_{k+1} - c_k\big) = c_n - c_0$.
6. **Products.** $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k) = \Big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\Big)$; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, and if $a_k > 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k > 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\lambda$, and naturals $m, n$. Write $\Sigma_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\Pi_n = \prod_{k<n} a_k$.

[L1] Recursion clauses ([[def-finite-sum]]): $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ and $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n$; $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1$ and $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) \cdot a_n$; and $\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k = \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j}$ for $m \le n$, likewise for products.

[L2] Field axioms: addition and multiplication are associative and commutative, $0$ and $1$ are the identities, $x - x = 0$, and multiplication distributes over addition ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]); and $0 \cdot x = 0$, which is not an axiom but a lemma ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

[L3] Induction principle: a property holding at $0$ and inherited by successors holds at every natural ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L4] Adding inequalities: $x \le y$ and $u \le v$ imply $x + u \le y + v$. [[lem-of-add-order]] states the STRICT forms and only those ($x < y \Rightarrow x + c < y + c$, and $x < y$ with $u < v$ giving $x + u < y + v$); the nonstrict form used throughout below is those two together with the cases $x = y$ and $u = v$, which are settled by trichotomy, the order being total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] The canonical embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a field homomorphism, so $\iota(0) = 0$ and $\iota(n+1) = \iota(n) + 1$, and $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L6] Sign rules: a product of two positives is positive ([[lem-of-sign-rules]], claim 1), and a product of two nonnegatives is nonnegative, since a factor equal to $0$ makes the product $0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]) and otherwise both factors are positive; and $1 > 0$, which is proved in [[cor-of-one-positive]] and stated by none of the items named above.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 0$: every claim holds at $n = 0$, since both sides of claim 1 are $0 = 0 + 0$, both sides of claim 2 are $0 = \lambda \cdot 0$ and $0 = \iota(0)\lambda$, claim 4 reads $0 \le 0$ with no term to bound and the hypothesis $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ giving nothing to prove, claim 5 reads $0 = c_0 - c_0$, and claim 6 reads $1 = 1 \cdot 1$ with $1 > 0$. [base, L1, L2, L5, L6]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for this $n$ and for all sequences $a, b, c$ and all $\lambda$. [ih]

1.3 Splitting, claim 3, by a separate induction on the number of trailing terms $d = n - m$ with $m$ fixed: for $d = 0$ the claim reads $\sum_{k<m} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + 0$ and $\prod_{k<m} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\big) \cdot 1$, which hold; and if $\sum_{k<m+d} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d} a_{m+j}$, then $\sum_{k<m+d+1} a_k = \sum_{k<m+d} a_k + a_{m+d} = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \big(\sum_{j<d} a_{m+j} + a_{m+d}\big) = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d+1} a_{m+j}$ by associativity, and identically for products with $1$ in place of $0$ and multiplication in place of addition, so induction on $d$ gives claim 3 for every $m \le n$. [L1, L2, L3]

2.1 Additivity at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k\big) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) + \big(\sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n\big) = \sum_{k<n+1} a_k + \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$, using the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of addition. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Scaling at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda a_k = \sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda\big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) = \lambda \sum_{k<n+1} a_k$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and distributivity; taking $a_k = 1$ for all $k$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda = \sum_{k<n} \lambda + \lambda = \iota(n)\lambda + \lambda = (\iota(n) + 1)\lambda = \iota(n+1)\lambda$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L5]

2.3 Monotonicity at $n+1$: assume $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n+1$; then $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$, so the hypothesis gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$, and adding the inequality $a_n \le b_n$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n \le \sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n = \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$. [step 1.2, L1, L4]

2.4 Telescoping at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(c_{k+1} - c_k) = \sum_{k<n}(c_{k+1} - c_k) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = (c_n - c_0) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = c_{n+1} - c_0$, by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and the field identities. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.5 Products at $n+1$: $\prod_{k<n+1}(a_k b_k) = \big(\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k)\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n+1} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n+1} b_k\big)$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of multiplication; and if every $a_k \ge 0$ for $k < n+1$ then $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) a_n$ is a product of two nonnegatives, hence nonnegative, with the same argument giving positivity from positivity since $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1 > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L6]

3.1 Consequences of monotonicity, completing claim 4: monotonicity itself holds at every $n$, by the induction principle applied to the base case of step 1.1 and the successor step 2.3, so it is available for an arbitrary $n$ in what follows; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then comparing with the zero sequence gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge \sum_{k<n} 0 = 0$; for $j < n$ splitting at $j$ and then at $j+1$ writes $\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<j} a_k + a_j + \sum_{k=j+1}^{n-1} a_k$ with the first and third summands $\ge 0$, so $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$; and if moreover $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ then $0 \le a_j \le 0$ for every $j < n$, so $a_j = 0$. [step 1.1, step 2.3, step 1.3, L3, L4, L2]

4.1 By the induction principle claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and claim 3 was proved in step 1.3 with its consequences in step 3.1, so all six laws hold. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, step 2.5, step 1.3, step 3.1, L3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfy

$$m \;\le\; f(x) \;\le\; M \qquad \text{for every } x \in [a,b],$$

with $m, M$ real. Then $f$ is bounded ([[def-bounded-set]]), so its Darboux sums
and integrals are defined ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-darboux-integral]]), and
for **every** partition $P$ of $[a,b]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]])

$$m(b-a) \;\le\; L(f,P) \;\le\; \underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; U(f,P) \;\le\; M(b-a) .$$

In particular, taking $f$ to be the constant function with value $c$:

$$\int_a^b c \;=\; c\,(b-a) ,$$

the constant function being integrable, with $L(f,P) = U(f,P) = c(b-a)$ for
every partition $P$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, reals $m \le M$, and $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ with $m \le f(x) \le M$ for every $x \in [a,b]$. Let $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$, with subintervals $I_i$ and lengths $\Delta_i$ for $i < n$.

[L1] $\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = b - a$, every $\Delta_i > 0$, and $n \ge 1$; each $I_i$ is a nonempty subset of $[a,b]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-interval]]).

[L2] $m_i = \inf f[I_i]$ and $M_i = \sup f[I_i]$ exist, $L(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}m_i\Delta_i$ and $U(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}M_i\Delta_i$, and $m_i \le f(x) \le M_i$ for $x \in I_i$ ([[def-darboux-sums]]).

[L3] $L(f,P) \le \underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,P)$ for every partition $P$; $f$ is integrable exactly when the two integrals are equal, and then $\int_a^b f$ is their common value ([[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L4] An infimum is the greatest lower bound and a supremum the least upper bound; a set with a single element has that element as both ([[def-infimum]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L5] Finite sums: scaling, monotonicity in the terms, and $\sum_{i<n}\lambda\,\Delta_i = \lambda\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L6] Ordered-field arithmetic: multiplying an inequality by a positive quantity preserves it, adding a constant preserves it, and the order is transitive; $|x| \le \max\{|m|,|M|\}$ whenever $m \le x \le M$ ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $f$ is bounded: $|f(x)| \le \max\{|m|,|M|\}$ for every $x \in [a,b]$ by [L6], so the Darboux sums and integrals of [L2] and [L3] are defined. [given, L6]

1.2 For every $i < n$: $m$ is a lower bound of $f[I_i]$ and $M$ an upper bound, since $I_i \subseteq [a,b]$; the set $f[I_i]$ is nonempty by [L1]. Hence $m \le m_i$ and $M_i \le M$ by [L4]. [given, L1, L2, L4]

1.3 **The constant case, treated on its own.** Suppose in addition that $f$ is the constant function with value $c$, that is $f(x) = c$ for every $x \in [a,b]$; the general argument below does not use this supposition. Then $f[I_i] = \{c\}$ for every $i < n$ by [L1], so $m_i = M_i = c$ by [L4], and $L(f,P) = U(f,P) = \sum_{i<n} c\,\Delta_i = c(b-a)$ by [L5] and [L1]. [L1, L2, L4, L5]

2.1 $L(f,P) \ge m(b-a)$: by step 1.2 and $\Delta_i > 0$ one has $m_i\Delta_i \ge m\Delta_i$ for every $i < n$, so monotonicity and scaling in [L5] give $L(f,P) \ge \sum_{i<n} m\,\Delta_i = m\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = m(b-a)$ by [L1]. [step 1.2, L1, L5, L6]

2.2 $U(f,P) \le M(b-a)$: the same argument with $M_i \le M$ gives $U(f,P) \le \sum_{i<n}M\,\Delta_i = M(b-a)$. [step 1.2, L1, L5, L6]

3.1 Combining steps 2.1 and 2.2 with the chain of [L3] gives the displayed five-term inequality for every partition $P$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L3]

4.1 Hence, still under the supposition of step 1.3 that $f$ is constant with value $c$, the set of lower sums and the set of upper sums are both $\{c(b-a)\}$, so $\underline{\int_a^b} f = \overline{\int_a^b} f = c(b-a)$ by [L4], $f$ is integrable, and $\int_a^b c = c(b-a)$ by [L3]. [step 1.3, L3, L4] ∎

## Remarks

- **The five-term chain is the only estimate most of this page needs.** Every integrability proof below produces one partition and controls $U(f,P) - L(f,P)$; the chain then locates both integrals inside an interval of that length, and [[thm-riemann-criterion]] turns the observation into an equivalence.

- **The bounds are sharp, but equality does not characterize constants.** Constant functions show that neither outer coefficient can be improved. Nonconstant functions can also attain equality: for the Dirichlet indicator on $[0,1]$, every partition has $L(f,P) = 0$ and $U(f,P) = 1$, so both outer bounds are equalities.

- **Nonnegativity, as a special case.** If $f \ge 0$ on $[a,b]$ then $m$ may be taken to be $0$, so $\int_a^b f \ge 0$ whenever the integral exists. A nonnegative integrand with vanishing integral need not vanish, however; that is [[fs-nonnegative-integrable-with-zero-integral-vanishes]].

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$, with
$|x|$ the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]). Then

$$|x| \ge 0; \quad |x| = 0 \iff x = 0; \quad -|x| \le x \le |x|; \quad |-x| = |x|; \quad |xy| = |x|\,|y|;$$

and, for every $c > 0$, one has $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and elements $x, y \in F$.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| = u$ if $u \ge 0$, and $|u| = -u$ if $u < 0$ ([[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Ordered-field order: trichotomy holds (for each $u$ exactly one of $u > 0$, $u = 0$, $u < 0$), $a < b$ means $b - a$ is positive, and sums and products of positives are positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Signs in products: $(-a)b = -(ab)$ and $(-a)(-b) = ab$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] Sign rules: a product of two elements of the same sign is positive, and a product of two elements of opposite sign is negative ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Case $x > 0$: by [L1] $|x| = x > 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; since $-x < 0$ we get $|-x| = -(-x) = x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -x < 0 < x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case pos, L1, L2, algebra]

1.2 Case $x = 0$: then $|x| = |0| = 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ holds with $|x| = 0$ and $x = 0$, while $|-x| = |0| = |x|$ and $-|x| = 0 \le 0 \le 0 = |x|$. [assume-case zero, L1]

1.3 Case $x < 0$: by [L1] $|x| = -x$, and [L2] gives $-x > 0$, so $|x| > 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; here $|-x| = -x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -(-x) = x \le x$ while $x < 0 < -x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case neg, L1, L2, algebra]

1.4 Case $x = 0$ or $y = 0$: then $xy = 0$, so $|xy| = 0$, and one of $|x|, |y|$ is $0$, whence $|x|\,|y| = 0 = |xy|$. [assume-case zerofactor, L1]

1.5 Case $x, y$ have the same sign (both positive or both negative): by [L4] $xy > 0$, so $|xy| = xy$, while $|x|\,|y| = xy$ by [L3] (for $x, y < 0$ this is $(-x)(-y) = xy$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case same, L1, L3, L4]

1.6 Case $x, y$ have opposite signs (one positive, one negative): by [L4] $xy < 0$, so $|xy| = -(xy)$, while $|x|\,|y| = -(xy)$ by [L3] (namely $x(-y)$ or $(-x)y$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case opposite, L1, L3, L4]

2.1 By trichotomy [L2] each $x$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.1-1.3, and in each we verified $|x| \ge 0$, that $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$, that $|-x| = |x|$, and that $-|x| \le x \le |x|$; hence all four hold for every $x$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, cases-exhaustive]

2.2 By trichotomy [L2] each pair $x, y$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.4-1.6, and in each $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$ for all $x, y$. [step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6, cases-exhaustive]

3.1 Let $c > 0$: if $|x| < c$ then $-c < -|x| \le x \le |x| < c$ by [step 2.1] and [L2], so $-c < x < c$; conversely if $-c < x < c$ then both $x < c$ and $-x < c$, and since $|x|$ equals $x$ or $-x$ by [L1], we get $|x| < c$, so $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$. [step 2.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Statement

Let $a < c < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]). Then:

1. $f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ ([[def-darboux-integral]]) **if and only if** its
   restrictions to $[a,c]$ and to $[c,b]$ are integrable;
2. and in that case
   $$\int_a^b f \;=\; \int_a^c f \;+\; \int_c^b f .$$
3. **Oriented form.** Let $\alpha < \beta$ be reals, let $f : [\alpha,\beta] \to
   \mathbb{R}$ be integrable, and let $u, v, w \in [\alpha,\beta]$ be arbitrary.
   Then, with the convention of [[def-oriented-integral]],
   $$\int_u^v f \;+\; \int_v^w f \;=\; \int_u^w f .$$

Claim 3 is where [[def-oriented-integral]] earns its place: it holds for every
arrangement of the three points, including the degenerate ones, and it is the
form used everywhere below.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < c < b$ and a bounded $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$; and, for claim 3, reals $\alpha < \beta$, an integrable $f : [\alpha,\beta] \to \mathbb{R}$ and points $u,v,w \in [\alpha,\beta]$. Let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given.

[L1] Riemann's criterion on any closed bounded interval with distinct endpoints ([[thm-riemann-criterion]]).

[L2] A function integrable on $[p,q]$ is integrable on every $[p',q'] \subseteq [p,q]$ with $p' < q'$ ([[lem-integrability-on-a-subinterval]]).

[L3] For a partition $R = (n,t)$ and bounded $h$: $L(h,R) = \sum_{i<n}m_i\Delta_i$, $U(h,R) = \sum_{i<n}M_i\Delta_i$, and $L(h,R) \le \underline{\int} h \le \overline{\int} h \le U(h,R)$, the integral being the common value of the two when they agree ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L4] A partition of $[p,q]$ is a pair $(n,t)$ with $n \ge 1$, $t_0 = p$, $t_i < t_{i+1}$ for $i < n$ and $t_k = q$ for $k \ge n$; its subintervals are $[t_i,t_{i+1}]$ for $i<n$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-interval]]).

[L5] Finite sums split at an intermediate index, with $\sum_{k=p}^{q-1}x_k = \sum_{j<q-p}x_{p+j}$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], clause 3).

[L6] With oriented limits, $\int_v^u h = -\int_u^v h$ and $\int_u^u h = 0$ ([[def-oriented-integral]]).

[L7] Ordered-field arithmetic: adding a constant preserves an inequality, the order is total and transitive, and a real of absolute value below every positive real is $0$ ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Claim 1, forward.** If $f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ then, since $a < c$ and $c < b$, [L2] gives integrability on $[a,c]$ and on $[c,b]$. [L2]

1.2 **The splice.** Let $P_1 = (n_1,t^1)$ be a partition of $[a,c]$ and $P_2 = (n_2,t^2)$ one of $[c,b]$. Define $P := (n_1+n_2,\ t)$ by $t_i := t^1_i$ for $i \le n_1$, $t_{n_1+j} := t^2_j$ for $j \le n_2$, and $t_k := b$ for $k \ge n_1+n_2$. The two prescriptions agree at $i = n_1$, where $t^1_{n_1} = c = t^2_0$; and $t_0 = a$, $t_{n_1+n_2} = t^2_{n_2} = b$, with $t_i < t_{i+1}$ for every $i < n_1+n_2$. So $P$ is a partition of $[a,b]$. [L4, construct]

1.3 **Claim 1, converse.** Suppose $f$ is integrable on $[a,c]$ and on $[c,b]$, and use [L1] on each to fix $P_1$ with $U(f,P_1)-L(f,P_1) < \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1}$ and $P_2$ with $U(f,P_2)-L(f,P_2) < \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1}$. [L1, choose]

2.1 The first $n_1$ subintervals of $P$ are those of $P_1$ and the last $n_2$ are those of $P_2$, with the matching lengths, so by [L3] and the splitting law [L5], $L(f,P) = L(f,P_1) + L(f,P_2)$ and $U(f,P) = U(f,P_1) + U(f,P_2)$. [step 1.2, L3, L4, L5]

3.1 For the splice $P$ of those two, step 2.1 gives $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$; as $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary and $f$ is bounded, [L1] makes $f$ integrable on $[a,b]$. [step 1.2, step 2.1, step 1.3, L1, L7]

4.1 **Claim 2.** With $P_1$, $P_2$ and $P$ as above, [L3] puts $\int_a^b f$ between $L(f,P)$ and $U(f,P)$, that is between $L(f,P_1)+L(f,P_2)$ and $U(f,P_1)+U(f,P_2)$ by step 2.1; and [L3] applied on $[a,c]$ and on $[c,b]$ puts $\int_a^c f + \int_c^b f$ between the same two numbers. [step 2.1, step 1.3, step 3.1, L3]

5.1 Those two numbers differ by less than $\varepsilon$ by step 1.3, so $\bigl|\int_a^b f - \int_a^c f - \int_c^b f\bigr| < \varepsilon$; as $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary the difference is $0$, which is claim 2. [step 1.3, step 4.1, L7]

6.1 **Claim 3, first the sorted case.** Let $x \le y$ in $[\alpha,\beta]$. Then $\int_\alpha^y f = \int_\alpha^x f + \int_x^y f$. Indeed if $\alpha < x < y$ this is claim 2 applied on $[\alpha,y]$, where $f$ is integrable by [L2]; if $x = \alpha$ the middle term is $0$ by [L6] and the identity is trivial; and if $x = y$ the last term is $0$ by [L6] and the identity is again trivial. [step 5.1, L2, L6]

7.1 Put $F(x) := \int_\alpha^x f$ for $x \in [\alpha,\beta]$, which is defined by [L2] and [L6]. Then $\int_x^y f = F(y) - F(x)$ for **all** $x,y \in [\alpha,\beta]$: for $x < y$ this is step 6.1 rearranged; for $x = y$ both sides are $0$ by [L6]; and for $x > y$ the case already proved gives $\int_y^x f = F(x)-F(y)$, and [L6] negates both sides. [step 6.1, L2, L6, construct]

8.1 **Claim 3.** For arbitrary $u,v,w \in [\alpha,\beta]$, step 7.1 gives $\int_u^v f + \int_v^w f = \bigl(F(v)-F(u)\bigr) + \bigl(F(w)-F(v)\bigr) = F(w)-F(u) = \int_u^w f$. [step 7.1, algebra] ∎

## Remarks

- **The oriented form is not proved by listing six orderings.** Step 7.1 shows that the oriented integral between two points is a *difference of values of one function of one variable*, after which claim 3 is the cancellation $(F(v)-F(u))+(F(w)-F(v)) = F(w)-F(u)$, valid however the three points are arranged and however many of them coincide. The case analysis is confined to the two lines of step 7.1, and no appeal to symmetry is made anywhere.

- **The function $F$ of step 7.1 is the integral function**, and it is given its own item, [[def-the-integral-function]], because the rest of the page is about it. Nothing there re-proves step 7.1; it cites this theorem.

- **Boundedness on the whole of $[a,b]$ is a hypothesis of claim 1 in both directions.** Boundedness on $[a,c]$ and on $[c,b]$ separately does give boundedness on the union, so the converse could be stated with the hypothesis split; it is stated globally because [[def-darboux-sums]] needs it globally to make $U(f,P)$ meaningful for a partition of $[a,b]$.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]) and let $I \in \mathbb{R}$. The following are equivalent.

1. **(Darboux)** $f$ is Darboux integrable on $[a,b]$ with
   $\int_a^b f = I$ ([[def-darboux-integral]]).
2. **(Riemann)** For every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$
   such that
   $$\bigl|\,S(f,P,\xi) - I\,\bigr| \;<\; \varepsilon$$
   for **every** tagged partition $(P,\xi)$ of $[a,b]$ with $\|P\| < \delta$
   ([[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

**The quantifier over tagged partitions is universal, and that is the content.**
Condition 2 constrains every tagged partition of small mesh at once, tags
included; it is not a statement about one sequence of tagged partitions, and it
cannot be weakened to one. The companion page of this pair exhibits a
non-integrable function whose Riemann sums are constant along such a sequence.

**Boundedness is a hypothesis of both conditions as stated here.** Condition 1
presupposes it, since the Darboux sums of an unbounded function do not exist
([[def-darboux-sums]]); condition 2 makes sense for unbounded $f$ as well, and
in fact implies boundedness, but that implication is not proved here and is not
used: every application on this page starts from a bounded $f$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, a bounded $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $M \ge 0$ with $|f(x)| \le M$ for every $x \in [a,b]$, and a real $I$. Put $M_{+} := M + 1$, so $M_{+} > 0$ and $|f(x)| \le M_{+}$ for every $x$.

[L1] For a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[a,b]$: $n \ge 1$, the subintervals $I_i = [t_i,t_{i+1}]$ are nonempty, $\Delta_i = t_{i+1} - t_i > 0$, $\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = b-a$, and $\|P\| = \max\{\Delta_i : i < n\}$. The uniform partition $U_N$ into $N \ge 1$ parts has $\|U_N\| = (b-a)/\iota(N)$. The common refinement $P \vee P_0$ refines both, and $n_{P \vee P_0} \le n_P + n_{P_0} - 1$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-interval]]).

[L2] $L(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}m_i\Delta_i$ and $U(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}M_i\Delta_i$ with $m_i = \inf f[I_i]$ and $M_i = \sup f[I_i]$; $L(f,P) \le \underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,P)$; $f$ is integrable exactly when the two integrals coincide, and then $\int_a^b f$ is their common value ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L3] $S(f,P,\xi) = \sum_{i<n}f(\xi_i)\Delta_i$ for a tagging $\xi$ of $P$, and $L(f,P) \le S(f,P,\xi) \le U(f,P)$ when $f$ is bounded ([[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]]).

[L4] Riemann's criterion: a bounded $f$ is integrable if and only if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a partition $P$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$ ([[thm-riemann-criterion]]).

[L5] If $P'$ refines $P$ then $L(f,P) \le L(f,P')$, $U(f,P') \le U(f,P)$, and moreover $U(f,P) - U(f,P') \le 2M_{+}\,\iota(n'-n)\,\|P\|$ and $L(f,P') - L(f,P) \le 2M_{+}\,\iota(n'-n)\,\|P\|$ ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]]).

[L6] $\varepsilon$-characterisations: if $u = \sup S$ with $S$ nonempty then for every real $\eta > 0$ there is $s \in S$ with $s > u - \eta$; dually for the infimum ([[lem-sup-epsilon]], [[lem-inf-epsilon]]).

[L7] A family of nonempty sets **indexed by a natural number** $n$ has a choice function, and this is a theorem of ZF; the family used below is indexed by $i < n$, which is exactly that listed form. [[lem-finite-choice]] states it in that form and expressly declines to identify it with "every finite family of nonempty sets has a choice function", no definition of finiteness being available where it is proved ([[lem-finite-choice]], [[def-choice-function]]).

[L8] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N) < \eta$; $\iota$ is nonnegative, additive and nondecreasing on $\mathbb{N}$, and $\iota(N) > 0$ for $N \ge 1$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L9] Finite sums: additivity, scaling, monotonicity in the terms ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L10] Ordered-field arithmetic and the absolute value: adding a constant and multiplying by a positive quantity preserve an inequality; the order is total and transitive; $|x| < c$ exactly when $-c < x < c$ for $c > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[cor-of-one-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Condition 2 implies condition 1.** Assume condition 2 and let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. Fix $\delta > 0$ as in condition 2 for this $\varepsilon$, and put $\theta := \varepsilon/(b-a) > 0$ by [L10]. [given, L10, choose]

1.2 **Condition 1 implies condition 2; this half of the proof is steps 1.2, 2.2, 2.3, 3.3, 4.2, 5.2 and 6.2, and its symbols are its own.** Assume $f$ is integrable with $\int_a^b f = I$ and let a real $\eta > 0$ be given. By [L4] fix a partition $P_0 = (n_0, t^0)$ with $U(f,P_0) - L(f,P_0) < \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$. [given, L4, L10, choose]

2.1 A partition of mesh below $\delta$ exists: by [L8] fix $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N) < \delta/(b-a)$ and take $P := U_N$, so $\|P\| = (b-a)/\iota(N) < \delta$ by [L1] and [L10]. Write $P = (n,t)$. [step 1.1, L1, L8, L10, choose]

2.2 By [L2] and integrability, $L(f,P_0) \le \underline{\int_a^b} f = I = \overline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,P_0)$. Hence $U(f,P_0) - I \le U(f,P_0) - L(f,P_0) < \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$ and $I - L(f,P_0) \le U(f,P_0) - L(f,P_0) < \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$, that is $U(f,P_0) < I + \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$ and $L(f,P_0) > I - \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$. [step 1.2, L2, L10]

2.3 Put $\delta_0 := \eta \cdot \bigl(8\,M_{+}\,\iota(n_0)\bigr)^{-1}$, a positive real since $M_{+} > 0$ and $\iota(n_0) > 0$ by [L8] and $n_0 \ge 1$ by [L1]. [step 1.2, L1, L8, L10, construct]

3.1 For each $i < n$ the set $X_i := \{\, x \in I_i : f(x) > M_i - \theta \,\}$ is nonempty by [L6], since $M_i = \sup f[I_i]$ and $f[I_i]$ is nonempty by [L1]. By [L7] the finite family $\{X_i : i < n\}$ has a choice function $g$; put $\xi_i := g(X_i)$ for $i < n$ and $\xi_k := b$ for $k \ge n$, a tagging of $P$. [step 2.1, L1, L2, L6, L7, choose]

3.2 Likewise the sets $Y_i := \{\, x \in I_i : f(x) < m_i + \theta \,\}$ are nonempty by [L6], and [L7] supplies a tagging $\zeta$ of $P$ with $\zeta_i \in Y_i$ for $i < n$. [step 2.1, L1, L2, L6, L7, choose]

3.3 Let $(Q,\upsilon)$ be any tagged partition of $[a,b]$ with $\|Q\| < \delta_0$, and write $Q = (n_Q,u)$ and $R := Q \vee P_0$, with $R = (n_R, r)$. By [L1], $R$ refines both $Q$ and $P_0$, and $n_R - n_Q \le n_0 - 1$, so $\iota(n_R - n_Q) \le \iota(n_0)$ by [L8]. [step 2.3, L1, L8, given]

4.1 $S(f,P,\xi) \ge U(f,P) - \varepsilon$: by step 3.1, $f(\xi_i) \ge M_i - \theta$ for $i < n$, so multiplying by $\Delta_i > 0$ and summing gives $S(f,P,\xi) \ge \sum_{i<n}(M_i - \theta)\Delta_i = U(f,P) - \theta\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = U(f,P) - \theta(b-a) = U(f,P) - \varepsilon$, by [L9], [L1] and [L3]. Symmetrically $S(f,P,\zeta) \le L(f,P) + \varepsilon$. [step 3.1, step 3.2, L1, L3, L9, L10]

4.2 By [L5] applied to the refinement $R$ of $Q$, $U(f,Q) - U(f,R) \le 2M_{+}\iota(n_R-n_Q)\|Q\| \le 2M_{+}\iota(n_0)\delta_0 = \eta \cdot 4^{-1}$, and likewise $L(f,R) - L(f,Q) \le \eta \cdot 4^{-1}$. [step 2.3, step 3.3, L5, L8, L10]

5.1 By condition 2 both $|S(f,P,\xi) - I| < \varepsilon$ and $|S(f,P,\zeta) - I| < \varepsilon$, since $\|P\| < \delta$. Hence $U(f,P) \le S(f,P,\xi) + \varepsilon < I + 2\varepsilon$ and $L(f,P) \ge S(f,P,\zeta) - \varepsilon > I - 2\varepsilon$, by step 4.1 and [L10]. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 4.1, L10]

5.2 By [L5] applied to the refinement $R$ of $P_0$, $U(f,R) \le U(f,P_0)$ and $L(f,R) \ge L(f,P_0)$. Combining with step 4.2 and step 2.2: $U(f,Q) \le U(f,R) + \eta \cdot 4^{-1} \le U(f,P_0) + \eta \cdot 4^{-1} < I + \eta \cdot 2^{-1} + \eta \cdot 4^{-1}$, and symmetrically $L(f,Q) > I - \eta \cdot 2^{-1} - \eta \cdot 4^{-1}$. [step 2.2, step 3.3, step 4.2, L5, L10]

6.1 By [L2], $\overline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,P) < I + 2\varepsilon$ and $\underline{\int_a^b} f \ge L(f,P) > I - 2\varepsilon$, and since $\underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f$ by [L2], both integrals lie strictly between $I - 2\varepsilon$ and $I + 2\varepsilon$; in particular $\bigl|\overline{\int_a^b} f - I\bigr| \le 2\varepsilon$ and $\bigl|\underline{\int_a^b} f - I\bigr| \le 2\varepsilon$. [step 5.1, L2, L10]

6.2 By [L3], $L(f,Q) \le S(f,Q,\upsilon) \le U(f,Q)$, so step 5.2 gives $I - \eta \cdot 2^{-1} - \eta \cdot 4^{-1} < S(f,Q,\upsilon) < I + \eta \cdot 2^{-1} + \eta \cdot 4^{-1}$, whence $|S(f,Q,\upsilon) - I| < \eta \cdot 2^{-1} + \eta \cdot 4^{-1} < \eta$ by [L10]. Since $(Q,\upsilon)$ was an arbitrary tagged partition of mesh below $\delta_0$, condition 2 holds with this $\delta_0$. [step 5.2, L3, L10]

7.1 Step 6.1 holds for **every** real $\varepsilon > 0$. If $\overline{\int_a^b} f \ne I$, taking $\varepsilon := \bigl|\overline{\int_a^b} f - I\bigr| \cdot 4^{-1} > 0$ would give $\bigl|\overline{\int_a^b} f - I\bigr| \le \bigl|\overline{\int_a^b} f - I\bigr| \cdot 2^{-1}$, which is false for a positive quantity; so $\overline{\int_a^b} f = I$, and the same argument gives $\underline{\int_a^b} f = I$. Hence $f$ is integrable with $\int_a^b f = I$ by [L2], which is condition 1. [step 6.1, L2, L10]

8.1 Steps 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 5.1, 6.1 and 7.1 prove that condition 2 implies condition 1; steps 1.2, 2.2, 2.3, 3.3, 4.2, 5.2 and 6.2 prove the converse. The two halves share no symbol, the first working with $\varepsilon, \delta, P, \xi, \zeta, \theta$ and the second with $\eta, \delta_0, P_0, Q, \upsilon, R$, and together they give the stated equivalence. [step 7.1, step 6.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the Riemann condition costs in choice: nothing beyond ZF.** The only selection made anywhere above is in steps 3.1 and 3.2, where a tag is picked in each of the $n$ subintervals of one fixed partition. That family is listed by the index $i < n$, and a family of nonempty sets listed by a natural number has a choice function outright ([[lem-finite-choice]]), with no appeal to any choice axiom. Every other existential in the proof is instantiated once. This is recorded in [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].

- **Why the mesh of the coarse partition is the right quantity.** Step 4.2 is the only place where the mesh hypothesis is spent, and it is spent through the quantitative clause of [[lem-refinement-inequalities]]. The symbols there are those of the second half: adding the at most $n_0 - 1$ interior points of $P_0$ to the arbitrary partition $Q$ can change each Darboux sum by at most $2M_{+}$ times the total length of the affected subintervals, and each of those has length below $\delta_0$, the mesh bound imposed on $Q$. The number $n_0$ is fixed **before** $\delta_0$ is chosen, in step 1.2 against step 2.3, which is why the argument is not circular.

- **The two conditions are not symmetric in what they presuppose.** Condition 1 names the integral as a supremum and an infimum and needs the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ to make sense; condition 2 names it as a limit of sums and could be stated over any ordered field. What the theorem says is that on $\mathbb{R}$ the two coincide, so the numerical picture and the order-theoretic one describe the same object.

- **The value $I$ is not a free parameter after the fact.** If condition 2 holds for $I$ and for $I'$ then $|I - I'| < 2\varepsilon$ for every $\varepsilon > 0$, by evaluating both at one tagged partition of small enough mesh, so $I = I'$. The integral is therefore determined by condition 2 alone, as it is by condition 1.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $A$
([[def-continuity-real]]) and let $K \subseteq A$ be **nonempty** and compact
([[def-open-cover-r]]). Then $\sup f[K]$ and $\inf f[K]$ exist and are
**attained**: there are $p, q \in K$ with

$$f(q) \;=\; \inf f[K] \;\le\; f(x) \;\le\; \sup f[K] \;=\; f(p) \qquad \text{for every } x \in K .$$

Equivalently, the set $f[K]$ has a maximum and a minimum
([[def-max-min]]), namely $\max f[K] = f(p)$ and $\min f[K] = f(q)$.

**Nonemptiness of $K$ is a hypothesis, not an oversight.** For $K = \varnothing$
the set $f[K]$ is empty, and neither a supremum nor a maximum of the empty set
exists in this library ([[def-complete-ordered-field]] supplies suprema of
nonempty sets bounded above only).

**This theorem is stated twice in this library, on purpose.** Its metric-space
twin is [[thm-extreme-value-metric]], proved from the cover machinery of metric
spaces; the proof below is $\mathbb{R}$-native, running through Heine-Borel for
$\mathbb{R}$ and the order-completeness of $\mathbb{R}$, and it uses no cover
argument beyond the one already spent in
[[thm-continuous-image-of-a-compact-set-r]]. That the two statements are the
same statement in two vocabularies is proved in
[[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]], later on this page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ continuous on $A$, and a nonempty compact set $K \subseteq A$; write $S := f[K]$.

[L1] $S = f[K]$ is compact ([[thm-continuous-image-of-a-compact-set-r]]), and it is nonempty because $K$ is.

[L2] $S$ is bounded: there is a real $M \ge 0$ with $|z| \le M$ for every $z \in S$, so $-M$ is a lower bound and $M$ an upper bound of $S$ ([[cor-boundedness-theorem-r]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L3] A compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is closed ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L4] Least upper bounds: a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ bounded above has a supremum ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]); a nonempty subset bounded below has an infimum ([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]).

[L5] Epsilon characterisations: for nonempty $S$ bounded above and $u = \sup S$, every real $\varepsilon > 0$ admits $s \in S$ with $u - \varepsilon < s$; dually for $\ell = \inf S$ there is $s \in S$ with $s < \ell + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-sup-epsilon]], [[lem-inf-epsilon]]).

[L6] Closure: $\overline{S}$ is the set of points every neighbourhood of which meets $S$, and $S$ is closed exactly when $S = \overline{S}$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L7] A maximum of a set is an element of it that bounds it above, and a minimum is an element that bounds it below ([[def-max-min]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L1] the set $S = f[K]$ is nonempty and compact, and by [L2] it is bounded; by [L3] it is closed. [L1, L2, L3]

2.1 By [L4] the supremum $u := \sup S$ and the infimum $\ell := \inf S$ exist. [step 1.1, L4]

3.1 **$u$ is adherent to $S$.** Let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. By [L5] there is $s \in S$ with $u - \varepsilon < s$, and $s \le u < u + \varepsilon$ since $u$ bounds $S$ above; hence $|s - u| < \varepsilon$, that is $s \in N_{\varepsilon}(u) \cap S$. So every neighbourhood of $u$ meets $S$. [step 2.1, L5, L6]

3.2 **$\ell$ is adherent to $S$.** Symmetrically, [L5] gives $s \in S$ with $s < \ell + \varepsilon$, and $\ell \le s$ since $\ell$ bounds $S$ below; hence $s \in N_{\varepsilon}(\ell) \cap S$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$. [step 2.1, L5, L6]

4.1 By [L6] the two steps above say $u \in \overline{S}$ and $\ell \in \overline{S}$; and $S$ is closed by step 1.1, so $\overline{S} = S$ and therefore $u \in S$ and $\ell \in S$. [step 1.1, step 3.1, step 3.2, L6]

5.1 Since $u \in S = f[K]$ there is $p \in K$ with $f(p) = u$, and since $\ell \in S$ there is $q \in K$ with $f(q) = \ell$. [step 4.1, choose]

6.1 For every $x \in K$ the value $f(x)$ lies in $S$, so $\ell \le f(x) \le u$, that is $f(q) \le f(x) \le f(p)$. Hence $u = \sup f[K] = f(p)$ is a maximum of $f[K]$ and $\ell = \inf f[K] = f(q)$ is a minimum of it, both attained at points of $K$. [step 2.1, step 4.1, step 5.1, L7] ∎

## Remarks

- **The two ingredients, kept apart.** Compactness of $K$ enters only through the compactness of the image; order-completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ enters only in the existence of $\sup S$ and $\inf S$. The bridge between them is closedness of $S$: a closed set contains the adherent points of itself, and the supremum of a nonempty bounded set is always adherent to it, by [[lem-sup-epsilon]]. Neither ingredient can be dropped: over $\mathbb{Q}$ the supremum need not exist, and on a noncompact domain the supremum exists and is not attained ([[cex-evt-fails-on-the-open-interval-and-on-the-half-line]]).

- **Attainment is exactly what the epsilon characterisation cannot give on its own.** [[lem-sup-epsilon]] produces points of $S$ arbitrarily close to $\sup S$ for any nonempty bounded $S$; nothing there says one of them equals $\sup S$. What closedness adds is that the limiting value is not lost.

- **The converse.** If every continuous real function on a set $E$ attains a greatest value, then $E$ is compact. That is the content of [[thm-compactness-is-necessary-for-evt-and-uniform-continuity]], which exhibits, for every noncompact $E$, a bounded continuous function on $E$ with no greatest value.

## Statement

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a \le b$. Then the closed bounded interval
$[a,b]$ ([[def-interval]]) is compact ([[def-open-cover-r]]): every family of
open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ whose union contains $[a,b]$ has a finite subfamily
whose union already contains $[a,b]$.

The proof is by repeated bisection. Supposing some open cover admits no finite
subcover, one halves the interval, keeps a half that still admits none, and
iterates; the halves shrink to a point, which the cover does reach, and a single
member of the cover then swallows a whole late-stage half. **The halving rule is
canonical**, taking the left half whenever the left half works, so the recursion
uses [[thm-recursion]] and no choice principle.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a \le b$ and an open cover $\mathcal{U}$ of $[a,b]$; the set $X := \{\, (u,v) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} : u \le v \,\}$; and the following terminology: a pair $(u,v) \in X$ is **bad** when there are no $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $U_0, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{U}$ with $[u,v] \subseteq U_0 \cup \dots \cup U_n$, that is, when the interval $[u,v]$ admits no finite subcover from $\mathcal{U}$.

[L1] Open cover, subcover, finite subfamily and compactness ([[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L2] Closed bounded intervals: $[u,v] = \{\, z : u \le z \le v \,\}$ is nonempty exactly when $u \le v$; and for $u \le m \le v$ one has $[u,v] = [u,m] \cup [m,v]$, since $z \in [u,v]$ satisfies $z \le m$ or $m < z$ by trichotomy ([[def-interval]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$, and $N_\varepsilon(x) = \{\, y : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L4] Recursion: for a set $Y$, an element $y_0 \in Y$ and a function $G : Y \to Y$ there is $h : \mathbb{N} \to Y$ with $h(0) = y_0$ and $h(k+1) = G(h(k))$ for every $k$ ([[thm-recursion]]).

[L5] Nested interval property: if $[a_k,b_k]$ with $a_k \le b_k$ satisfy $[a_{k+1},b_{k+1}] \subseteq [a_k,b_k]$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, then $\bigcap_{k} [a_k,b_k] \ne \varnothing$ ([[thm-nested-interval-property]]).

[L6] Reciprocal Archimedean property: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]]).

[L7] Canonical naturals: $n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} > 0$ for $n \ge 1$, the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ is strictly increasing, and $(n+1) \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} = n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} + 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]); a positive element has a positive inverse and $0 < c \le d$ gives $0 < 1/d \le 1/c$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

[L8] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, hence $2 := 1 + 1 > 0$ and $2^{-1} > 0$; adding a constant preserves an inequality and multiplying by a positive preserves it ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

[L9] Absolute value: $|y - x| \le v - u$ whenever $x, y \in [u,v]$, because $|y - x|$ equals $y - x$ or $x - y$ and each is at most $v - u$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $[a,b]$ is not compact: some open cover $\mathcal{U}$ of $[a,b]$ has no finite subcover, that is, the pair $(a,b) \in X$ is bad. [assume-contra, L1]

1.2 Bisection rule: for $(u,v) \in X$ put $m := (u+v) \cdot 2^{-1}$, so that $u \le m \le v$ by [L8], and define $G(u,v) := (u,m)$ if $(u,m)$ is bad and $G(u,v) := (m,v)$ otherwise. This is a definition by cases on one condition, so $G : X \to X$ is a function and nothing is selected. [L2, L8, construct]

1.3 If $(u,v)$ is bad then $G(u,v)$ is bad: were both $(u,m)$ and $(m,v)$ not bad, concatenating the two finite lists of members of $\mathcal{U}$ would give a finite subfamily whose union contains $[u,m] \cup [m,v] = [u,v]$ by [L2], so $(u,v)$ would not be bad; hence at least one half is bad, and the rule returns the left half when it is bad and otherwise the right half, which must then be bad. [L1, L2]

2.1 Apply [L4] with $Y = X$, seed $(a,b)$ and map $G$: there is $h : \mathbb{N} \to X$ with $h(0) = (a,b)$ and $h(k+1) = G(h(k))$. Write $h(k) = (a_k,b_k)$, so $a_k \le b_k$ for every $k$, $(a_0,b_0) = (a,b)$, and $(a_{k+1},b_{k+1})$ is one of the two halves of $(a_k,b_k)$. [step 1.2, L2, L4, construct]

3.1 Every $(a_k,b_k)$ is bad, by induction on $k$: the case $k = 0$ is step 1.1, and if $(a_k,b_k)$ is bad then $(a_{k+1},b_{k+1}) = G(a_k,b_k)$ is bad by step 1.3. [step 1.1, step 1.3, step 2.1]

3.2 Writing $\ell_k := b_k - a_k \ge 0$, the intervals are nested and the lengths halve: $[a_{k+1},b_{k+1}]$ is $[a_k,m_k]$ or $[m_k,b_k]$ with $m_k = (a_k+b_k) \cdot 2^{-1}$, and each of these is contained in $[a_k,b_k]$ by [L2], while $m_k - a_k = b_k - m_k = \ell_k \cdot 2^{-1}$, so $\ell_{k+1} = \ell_k \cdot 2^{-1}$. [step 2.1, L2, L8]

4.1 For every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ one has $\ell_k \cdot (k+1) \le \ell_0$, by induction on $k$: at $k = 0$ this reads $\ell_0 \cdot 1 \le \ell_0$; and if it holds at $k$ then $\ell_{k+1} \cdot (k+2) = \ell_k \cdot 2^{-1} \cdot (k+2) \le \ell_k \cdot (k+1) \le \ell_0$, using $\ell_k \ge 0$ and $(k+2) \cdot 2^{-1} \le k+1$, which is $k + 2 \le 2k+2$, that is $0 \le k$. [step 3.2, L7, L8]

4.2 By [L5] the nested family $[a_k,b_k]$ of nonempty closed bounded intervals has a common point $x$; since $x \in [a_0,b_0] = [a,b]$ and $\mathcal{U}$ covers $[a,b]$, fix $U \in \mathcal{U}$ with $x \in U$ and then, $U$ being open, a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$. [step 3.2, L1, L2, L3, L5, choose]

5.1 There is $k \in \mathbb{N}$ with $\ell_k < \varepsilon$: the real $\varepsilon/(\ell_0+1)$ is positive because $\ell_0 + 1 > 0$, so [L6] supplies a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon/(\ell_0+1)$; put $k := n-1$, a natural number, so that $k+1 = n$ and step 4.1 with [L7] gives $\ell_k \le \ell_0 \cdot (1/n) \le \ell_0 \cdot \varepsilon/(\ell_0+1) < \varepsilon$, the last step because $\ell_0 < \ell_0 + 1$ forces $\ell_0/(\ell_0+1) < 1$ and $\varepsilon > 0$. [step 4.1, step 4.2, L6, L7, L8, choose]

6.1 For that $k$ one has $x \in [a_k,b_k]$, and every $y \in [a_k,b_k]$ satisfies $|y - x| \le \ell_k < \varepsilon$ by [L9], so $[a_k,b_k] \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; hence the one-member subfamily $\{U\}$ of $\mathcal{U}$ covers $[a_k,b_k]$ and $(a_k,b_k)$ is not bad, contradicting step 3.1. The assumption of step 1.1 is therefore untenable and $[a,b]$ is compact. [step 3.1, step 4.2, step 5.1, L1, L3, L9, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **What each hypothesis buys.** Closedness enters through [L5]: the nested
  interval property is stated for closed intervals and fails for open ones
  ([[cex-nested-open-intervals-empty]]). Boundedness enters through the same
  fact and through the length computation of step 3.2. Completeness of
  $\mathbb{R}$ enters only inside [[thm-nested-interval-property]] and, through
  [[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], in step 5.1.

- **Why the lengths are handled without powers.** The obvious route is
  $\ell_k = \ell_0 \cdot 2^{-k}$ together with the nullity of a geometric
  sequence, which is available ([[lem-geometric-sequence-null]]). The route
  taken instead, the one-line induction of step 4.1, gives the weaker bound
  $\ell_k \le \ell_0/(k+1)$, which is all step 5.1 needs, and it avoids
  integer powers and the algebra of limits entirely.

- **The recursion is over pairs, not over sets.** The state carried from stage
  to stage is the pair of endpoints, so [L4] applies with $Y = X$ and a total
  map $G$; had the rule been "choose a bad half", the state would have been
  chosen rather than computed and the argument would have needed dependent
  choice, which this library does not have.

- **The converse direction is a separate result.** That a compact subset of
  $\mathbb{R}$ must be closed and bounded is
  [[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]], and the two together give
  [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]].

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]). Then:

1. $f + g$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ and
   $\int_a^b (f+g) = \int_a^b f + \int_a^b g$;
2. for every real $\lambda$, $\lambda f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ and
   $\int_a^b \lambda f = \lambda \int_a^b f$;
3. consequently, for all reals $\lambda, \mu$ the function $\lambda f + \mu g$ is
   integrable and
   $$\int_a^b(\lambda f + \mu g) \;=\; \lambda\int_a^b f \;+\; \mu\int_a^b g ;$$
4. the same identity holds with oriented limits: if $u, v \in [a,b]$ and $f, g$
   are integrable between $u$ and $v$ ([[def-oriented-integral]]), then
   $\int_u^v(\lambda f + \mu g) = \lambda\int_u^v f + \mu\int_u^v g$.

**Linearity of the integral is not linearity of the Darboux sums**, and the
proof of claim 1 has to squeeze rather than compute. On a subinterval the
inequality $\sup(f+g) \le \sup f + \sup g$ can be strict — take $f(x) = x$ and
$g(x) = -x$ on $[0,1]$, where the left side is $0$ and the right side is $1$ —
so $U(f+g,P)$ is in general strictly below $U(f,P) + U(g,P)$ and no identity
between upper sums is available. Claim 2, by contrast, is an identity at the
level of the sums, with the roles of $\sup$ and $\inf$ exchanged when
$\lambda < 0$.

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, integrable $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, reals $\lambda, \mu$, and a real $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] Riemann's criterion: a bounded $h$ on $[a,b]$ is integrable if and only if for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a partition $P$ with $U(h,P) - L(h,P) < \eta$ ([[thm-riemann-criterion]]).

[L2] For every partition $P$ and bounded $h$: $L(h,P) \le \underline{\int_a^b} h \le \overline{\int_a^b} h \le U(h,P)$, and $h$ is integrable exactly when the two integrals agree, their common value being $\int_a^b h$; the lower integral is $\sup_P L(h,P)$ and the upper is $\inf_P U(h,P)$ ([[def-darboux-integral]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L3] $L(h,P) = \sum_{i<n} m_i(h)\Delta_i$ and $U(h,P) = \sum_{i<n}M_i(h)\Delta_i$, where $m_i(h) = \inf h[I_i]$ and $M_i(h) = \sup h[I_i]$ over the subintervals $I_i$ of $P = (n,t)$, with $\Delta_i > 0$; an integrable function is bounded, and a sum of two bounded functions and a scalar multiple of a bounded function are bounded ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L4] If $P'$ refines $P$ then $L(h,P) \le L(h,P') \le U(h,P') \le U(h,P)$; the common refinement $P_1 \vee P_2$ refines both ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L5] Finite sums are additive and homogeneous: $\sum_{i<n}(x_i + y_i) = \sum_{i<n}x_i + \sum_{i<n}y_i$ and $\sum_{i<n}\lambda x_i = \lambda\sum_{i<n}x_i$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], clauses 1 and 2).

[L6] A supremum is the least upper bound and an infimum the greatest lower bound; both exist for a nonempty bounded set and are unique ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-infimum]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L7] Reflection: writing $-S = \{-s : s \in S\}$, a real $u$ is an upper bound of $S$ exactly when $-u$ is a lower bound of $-S$, and conversely; hence $\sup(-S) = -\inf S$ and $\inf(-S) = -\sup S$ for nonempty bounded $S$, by [L6] ([[lem-reflection]]).

[L8] The constant function $0$ is integrable with $\int_a^b 0 = 0$ ([[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]]).

[L9] Ordered-field arithmetic: adding a constant and multiplying by a positive quantity preserve an inequality, the order is total and transitive, and a real $x$ with $|x| < \eta$ for every real $\eta > 0$ is $0$ ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order facts are used in their nonstrict form as well, obtained by adjoining the case of equality.

[L10] With oriented limits, $\int_v^u h = -\int_u^v h$ and $\int_u^u h = 0$ ([[def-oriented-integral]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $f$, $g$, $f+g$ and $\lambda f$ are bounded on $[a,b]$, so all their Darboux sums and integrals are defined. [given, L3]

1.2 For every partition $P = (n,t)$ and every $i < n$: $f(x) + g(x) \le M_i(f) + M_i(g)$ for $x \in I_i$, so $M_i(f) + M_i(g)$ is an upper bound of $(f+g)[I_i]$ and $M_i(f+g) \le M_i(f) + M_i(g)$ by [L6]; dually $m_i(f+g) \ge m_i(f) + m_i(g)$. [L3, L6]

1.3 Fix partitions $P_1$ and $P_2$ with $U(f,P_1) - L(f,P_1) < \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$ and $U(g,P_2) - L(g,P_2) < \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$, and put $P := P_1 \vee P_2$. [given, L1, L4, choose]

1.4 **Claim 2, the case $\lambda = 0$.** Then $\lambda f$ is the constant function $0$, integrable with integral $0 = 0 \cdot \int_a^b f$. [L8]

1.5 **Claim 2, the case $\lambda > 0$.** For every partition $P$ and every $i < n$, $\lambda M_i(f)$ is an upper bound of $(\lambda f)[I_i]$, and any upper bound $w$ of $(\lambda f)[I_i]$ gives the upper bound $w/\lambda$ of $f[I_i]$, whence $M_i(f) \le w/\lambda$ and $\lambda M_i(f) \le w$; so $M_i(\lambda f) = \lambda M_i(f)$ by [L6], and dually $m_i(\lambda f) = \lambda m_i(f)$. [L3, L6, L9]

1.6 **Claim 2, the case $\lambda = -1$.** For every $P$ and $i < n$, $(-f)[I_i] = -\bigl(f[I_i]\bigr)$, so $M_i(-f) = -m_i(f)$ and $m_i(-f) = -M_i(f)$ by [L7]. [L3, L7]

2.1 By [L4], $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1}$ and $U(g,P) - L(g,P) < \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$. [step 1.3, L4]

2.2 Summing the inequalities of step 1.2 over $i < n$ against the positive weights $\Delta_i$ and using [L5] gives $L(f,P) + L(g,P) \le L(f+g,P) \le U(f+g,P) \le U(f,P) + U(g,P)$. [step 1.2, L3, L5, L9]

2.3 With step 1.5 and [L5], $U(\lambda f,P) = \lambda U(f,P)$ and $L(\lambda f, P) = \lambda L(f,P)$ for $\lambda > 0$; hence $U(\lambda f,P)-L(\lambda f,P) = \lambda\bigl(U(f,P)-L(f,P)\bigr)$, which [L1] makes smaller than any prescribed positive number by choosing $P$ suitably, so $\lambda f$ is integrable. [step 1.5, L1, L3, L5, L9]

2.4 With step 1.6 and [L5], $U(-f,P) = -L(f,P)$ and $L(-f,P) = -U(f,P)$, so $U(-f,P)-L(-f,P) = U(f,P)-L(f,P)$ and $-f$ is integrable by [L1]; and by [L7] applied to the sets of Darboux sums, $\overline{\int_a^b}(-f) = -\underline{\int_a^b} f$ and $\underline{\int_a^b}(-f) = -\overline{\int_a^b} f$, so $\int_a^b(-f) = -\int_a^b f$. [step 1.6, L1, L2, L5, L7]

3.1 Hence $U(f+g,P) - L(f+g,P) \le \bigl(U(f,P)-L(f,P)\bigr) + \bigl(U(g,P)-L(g,P)\bigr) < \varepsilon$, so $f+g$ is integrable by [L1], $\varepsilon > 0$ having been arbitrary. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, L1, L9]

3.2 Moreover the set of lower sums of $\lambda f$ is $\lambda$ times the set of lower sums of $f$, and a supremum scales by a positive factor, by the argument of step 1.5 applied to that set; so $\underline{\int_a^b}\lambda f = \lambda \underline{\int_a^b} f$, and likewise for the upper integrals, giving $\int_a^b \lambda f = \lambda\int_a^b f$. [step 1.5, step 2.3, L2, L6, L9]

4.1 Both $\int_a^b(f+g)$ and $\int_a^b f + \int_a^b g$ lie in the interval from $L(f,P)+L(g,P)$ to $U(f,P)+U(g,P)$: the first by [L2] and step 2.2, the second by [L2] applied to $f$ and to $g$ separately. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, L2]

4.2 **Claim 2 for $\lambda < 0$.** Then $-\lambda > 0$ and $\lambda f = (-\lambda)(-f)$, so steps 2.3, 2.4 and 3.2 give integrability and the required identities and $\int_a^b \lambda f = (-\lambda)\int_a^b(-f) = (-\lambda)\bigl(-\int_a^b f\bigr) = \lambda\int_a^b f$. [step 2.3, step 3.2, step 2.4, L9]

5.1 That interval has length less than $\varepsilon$ by step 2.1, so $\bigl|\int_a^b(f+g) - \int_a^b f - \int_a^b g\bigr| < \varepsilon$; as $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary the difference is $0$, which is claim 1. [step 2.1, step 4.1, L9]

5.2 Claim 2 is now proved in all three cases $\lambda = 0$, $\lambda > 0$ and $\lambda < 0$, which are exhaustive by trichotomy. [step 1.4, step 2.3, step 3.2, step 4.2, L9]

6.1 **Claim 3.** By claim 2 the functions $\lambda f$ and $\mu g$ are integrable with integrals $\lambda\int_a^b f$ and $\mu\int_a^b g$, and by claim 1 their sum is integrable with the sum of those integrals. [step 5.1, step 5.2]

7.1 **Claim 4.** If $u < v$ then $u, v \in [a,b]$ and claim 3 applies verbatim on $[u,v]$; if $u = v$ both sides are $0$ by [L10]; and if $u > v$ then applying the case $u < v$ to the pair $(v,u)$ and multiplying by $-1$ gives the identity, by [L10]. [step 6.1, L10] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why claim 1 cannot be an identity of Darboux sums.** The example in the statement shows $\sup(f+g) < \sup f + \sup g$ is possible on a single subinterval, so $U(f+g,P) = U(f,P)+U(g,P)$ is false in general. What survives is the pair of inequalities of step 1.2, and they are enough because the gap between them is squeezed to $0$ by [[thm-riemann-criterion]].

- **The two scalar cases really are different.** For $\lambda > 0$ the extreme values scale; for $\lambda < 0$ they are exchanged, because multiplying by a negative reverses the order ([[lem-reflection]]). Merging the cases and writing $U(\lambda f, P) = \lambda U(f,P)$ for all $\lambda$ would be false at $\lambda = -1$, where the correct identity is $U(-f,P) = -L(f,P)$.

- **The set of integrable functions on $[a,b]$ is closed under the operations named here and under more.** Products, absolute values and the lattice operations are also integrable, but none of them is obtained from linearity alone: the proofs of [[cor-integrability-of-absolute-values-products-and-lattice-operations]] all pass through [[thm-composition-with-a-continuous-function]], with linearity used only to recombine the pieces.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be monotone, that is
nondecreasing or nonincreasing on $[a,b]$ ([[def-monotone-function]]). Then $f$
is bounded ([[def-bounded-set]]) and Riemann integrable on $[a,b]$
([[def-darboux-integral]]).

Moreover, for the uniform partition $U_N$ of $[a,b]$ into $N \ge 1$ parts
([[def-partition-and-refinement]]),

$$U(f,U_N) - L(f,U_N) \;=\; \bigl|f(b) - f(a)\bigr| \cdot \frac{b-a}{\iota(N)} ,$$

where $\iota(N)$ is the canonical natural of $N$ in $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-canonical-natural]]). The right-hand side is an **equality**, not an
estimate: the sum $\sum_{i<N}(M_i - m_i)$ telescopes exactly, because on each
subinterval a monotone function attains its extremes at the two endpoints.

No continuity is assumed, and none holds in general: a nondecreasing function may
be discontinuous at every rational
([[thm-monotone-with-prescribed-discontinuity-set]]), and the companion page of
this pair works out the integral of the floor function, the simplest
discontinuous monotone integrand.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and a monotone $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$. Let $N \ge 1$ be a natural number and let $U_N = (N,t)$ be the uniform partition of $[a,b]$ into $N$ parts, with subintervals $I_i = [t_i,t_{i+1}]$ and lengths $\Delta_i = (b-a)/\iota(N)$ for $i < N$.

[L1] $f$ is nondecreasing, meaning $f(x) \le f(y)$ whenever $x \le y$ in $[a,b]$, or nonincreasing, meaning $f(x) \ge f(y)$ whenever $x \le y$; these two cases are what "monotone" means and they exhaust it ([[def-monotone-function]]).

[L2] For the uniform partition: $t_0 = a$, $t_N = b$, $t_i < t_{i+1}$, every $\Delta_i = (b-a)/\iota(N) > 0$, and $\sum_{i<N}\Delta_i = b-a$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L3] If a nonempty set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ has a greatest element then that element is $\sup S$, and if it has a least element then that element is $\inf S$ ([[def-max-min]], [[def-infimum]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L4] $M_i = \sup f[I_i]$, $m_i = \inf f[I_i]$, $U(f,P) - L(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}(M_i-m_i)\Delta_i$ ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L5] Finite sums: scaling and telescoping, $\sum_{i<N}(c_{i+1}-c_i) = c_N - c_0$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L6] Riemann's criterion: a bounded $f$ is integrable if and only if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a partition $P$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$ ([[thm-riemann-criterion]]).

[L7] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N) < \eta$, and $\iota(N) > 0$ for $N \ge 1$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L8] Ordered-field arithmetic and the absolute value: adding a constant and multiplying by a positive quantity preserve an inequality; the order is total and transitive; $|x| = x$ for $x \ge 0$ and $|x| = -x$ for $x \le 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-interval]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 By [L1] there are two cases, $f$ nondecreasing and $f$ nonincreasing, and they exhaust the hypothesis. Every $x \in [a,b]$ satisfies $a \le x \le b$ ([[def-interval]]). [given, L1, cases]

1.2 **Case: $f$ is nondecreasing.** Then $f(a) \le f(x) \le f(b)$ for every $x \in [a,b]$, so $f$ is bounded by [L8]; and for $i < N$ and $x \in I_i$ one has $t_i \le x \le t_{i+1}$, hence $f(t_i) \le f(x) \le f(t_{i+1})$. Since $f(t_i)$ and $f(t_{i+1})$ themselves lie in $f[I_i]$, they are its least and greatest elements, so $m_i = f(t_i)$ and $M_i = f(t_{i+1})$ by [L3]. [assume-case up, given, L2, L3, L8]

1.3 **Case: $f$ is nonincreasing.** Then $f(b) \le f(x) \le f(a)$ for every $x \in [a,b]$, so $f$ is bounded; and for $i < N$ and $x \in I_i$ one has $f(t_{i+1}) \le f(x) \le f(t_i)$, so $m_i = f(t_{i+1})$ and $M_i = f(t_i)$ by [L3]. [assume-case down, given, L2, L3, L8]

2.1 In the nondecreasing case, $M_i - m_i = f(t_{i+1}) - f(t_i)$, so by [L4], [L2] and [L5], $U(f,U_N) - L(f,U_N) = \sum_{i<N}\bigl(f(t_{i+1}) - f(t_i)\bigr)\frac{b-a}{\iota(N)} = \frac{b-a}{\iota(N)}\bigl(f(t_N) - f(t_0)\bigr) = \frac{b-a}{\iota(N)}\bigl(f(b) - f(a)\bigr)$, and $f(b) - f(a) \ge 0$, so this equals $|f(b)-f(a)|(b-a)/\iota(N)$ by [L8]. [step 1.2, L2, L4, L5, L8]

2.2 In the nonincreasing case the same computation gives $U(f,U_N) - L(f,U_N) = \frac{b-a}{\iota(N)}\bigl(f(a) - f(b)\bigr)$ with $f(a) - f(b) \ge 0$, which is again $|f(b)-f(a)|(b-a)/\iota(N)$ by [L8]. The two cases of step 1.1 exhaust the hypothesis, so the displayed identity holds for every monotone $f$, which is also bounded. [step 1.3, L2, L4, L5, L8, cases-exhaustive]

3.1 Let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given and put $\eta := \varepsilon \cdot \bigl((|f(b)-f(a)| + 1)(b-a)\bigr)^{-1}$, a positive real by [L8]. By [L7] fix a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N) < \eta$. [step 2.2, L7, L8, choose]

4.1 Then $U(f,U_N) - L(f,U_N) = |f(b)-f(a)|\,(b-a)/\iota(N) \le (|f(b)-f(a)|+1)(b-a)/\iota(N) < (|f(b)-f(a)|+1)(b-a)\,\eta = \varepsilon$: the first inequality because $(b-a)/\iota(N) > 0$ and $|f(b)-f(a)| \le |f(b)-f(a)|+1$, and the second because $(|f(b)-f(a)|+1)(b-a) > 0$ and $1/\iota(N) < \eta$. So $U(f,U_N) - L(f,U_N) < \varepsilon$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, L8]

5.1 Since the real $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary and step 4.1 produced a partition with $U - L < \varepsilon$, criterion [L6] applies: $f$ is bounded by steps 1.2 and 1.3 and Riemann integrable on $[a,b]$. [step 1.2, step 1.3, step 4.1, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- **The telescoping is exact, and that is what makes the proof short.** No estimate of $M_i - m_i$ is needed subinterval by subinterval: the whole sum of the gaps is the total rise of $f$, however wildly the rise is distributed. This is why a monotone function with infinitely many jumps is no harder than a continuous one here, and it is the same telescoping that [[def-partition-and-refinement]] uses for the lengths.

- **Uniformity of the partition is a convenience, not a necessity.** For an arbitrary partition $P$ the same identification of $m_i$ and $M_i$ gives $U(f,P) - L(f,P) \le \|P\| \cdot |f(b)-f(a)|$, by bounding each $\Delta_i$ by the mesh before telescoping. The uniform partition is used above only so that $\Delta_i$ can be pulled out of the sum as a constant.

- **No choice principle is used.** The partition is given by a formula in $N$, and $N$ is obtained from one instance of the Archimedean property. See [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].

- **Monotone is strictly weaker than continuous here.** The floor function is nondecreasing with jumps at every integer and is integrable (the companion page of this pair); and a monotone function has at most countably many discontinuities ([[thm-froda]]), so this theorem is also a special case of [[cor-countably-many-discontinuities-integrable]] once that is available. The direct proof is kept because it is elementary and quantitative, and because it costs no choice at all.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]). Then:

1. **Nonnegativity.** If $f(x) \ge 0$ for every $x \in [a,b]$ then
   $\int_a^b f \ge 0$.
2. **Monotonicity.** If $f(x) \le g(x)$ for every $x \in [a,b]$ then
   $$\int_a^b f \;\le\; \int_a^b g .$$
3. **Two-sided bound.** If $m \le f(x) \le M$ for every $x \in [a,b]$, with
   $m, M$ real, then
   $$m\,(b-a) \;\le\; \int_a^b f \;\le\; M\,(b-a) .$$

**Equality in claim 1 does not force $f$ to vanish.** A nonnegative integrable
function with integral $0$ may be positive at infinitely many points; that is
[[fs-nonnegative-integrable-with-zero-integral-vanishes]] on the previous page's
companion. Under the additional hypothesis of continuity the conclusion does
hold, and that is [[thm-nonnegative-continuous-with-zero-integral-vanishes]]
below.

**Claim 2 is stated for $a < b$ and is not orientation-invariant.** With the
convention of [[def-oriented-integral]], $f \le g$ gives
$\int_u^v f \le \int_u^v g$ when $u \le v$ and the reverse inequality when
$u \ge v$, since both sides change sign together.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and integrable $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, with reals $m \le M$ where claim 3 is concerned.

[A1] $f(x) \ge 0$ for every $x \in [a,b]$.

[A2] $f(x) \le g(x)$ for every $x \in [a,b]$.

[A3] $m \le f(x) \le M$ for every $x \in [a,b]$.

[L1] If $m' \le h \le M'$ on $[a,b]$ then $m'(b-a) \le L(h,P) \le \underline{\int_a^b} h \le \overline{\int_a^b} h \le U(h,P) \le M'(b-a)$ for every partition $P$ ([[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]], [[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L2] If $h$ is integrable then $\int_a^b h$ is the common value of the lower and upper integrals ([[def-darboux-integral]], [[def-infimum]]).

[L3] Sums and scalar multiples of integrable functions are integrable, and $\int_a^b(\lambda h + \nu k) = \lambda\int_a^b h + \nu\int_a^b k$ ([[thm-linearity-of-the-integral]]).

[L4] Ordered-field arithmetic: adding a constant to both sides of an inequality preserves it, and the order is total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). The nonstrict forms follow from the strict ones by adjoining the case of equality.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Claim 1.** Under [A1] the constant $0$ is a lower bound of $f$ on $[a,b]$, so [L1] applies with $m' := 0$ and gives $\underline{\int_a^b} f \ge 0$. [A1, L1]

1.2 **Claim 2.** Under [A2] the function $h := g - f$ satisfies $h(x) \ge 0$ for every $x \in [a,b]$, and $h$ is integrable with $\int_a^b h = \int_a^b g - \int_a^b f$ by [L3]. [A2, L3, L4]

2.1 Since $f$ is integrable, $\int_a^b f = \underline{\int_a^b} f \ge 0$ by [L2]. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 By claim 1 applied to $h$, $\int_a^b g - \int_a^b f \ge 0$, that is $\int_a^b f \le \int_a^b g$. [step 2.1, step 1.2, L4]

4.1 **Claim 3.** Under [A3], [L1] applied to $f$ with $m' := m$ and $M' := M$ gives $m(b-a) \le \underline{\int_a^b} f$ and $\overline{\int_a^b} f \le M(b-a)$, and both integrals equal $\int_a^b f$ by [L2]. [A3, L1, L2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Claim 3 is cited, not reproved.** [[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]] already proves the five-term chain for every partition, and it is the item that also computes the integral of a constant, $\int_a^b c = c(b-a)$. Claim 3 is that chain read at an integrable $f$; nothing new is established here.

- **Claim 2 is proved through claim 1 and linearity, and not by comparing Darboux sums.** Comparing sums works too, since $f \le g$ gives $m_i(f) \le m_i(g)$ and $M_i(f) \le M_i(g)$ on every subinterval, but the route through $g - f$ is shorter and uses only results already available. Either way the hypothesis is a pointwise inequality on the *whole* of $[a,b]$; an inequality holding off a finite set gives the same conclusion, by [[lem-changing-a-function-at-finitely-many-points]], and that is a separate statement.

- **What claim 2 is for.** It is what turns a pointwise estimate on an integrand into an estimate on the integral, and every estimate of that shape on this page and its companion is an application of it. No count of those applications is asserted here; the dependency graph of the page is where that is read off.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]). Then $f$ is Darboux integrable on $[a,b]$
([[def-darboux-integral]]) **if and only if**

$$\text{for every real } \varepsilon > 0 \text{ there is a partition } P \text{ of } [a,b] \text{ with } U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$$

([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

**This is the criterion every later integrability proof on this page uses.** It
replaces a statement about a supremum and an infimum over all partitions, which
cannot be checked directly, by the exhibition of a **single** partition for each
$\varepsilon$. The criterion says nothing about the value of the integral; that
is located separately, by [[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]], between $L(f,P)$
and $U(f,P)$ for the same $P$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and a bounded $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$.

[A1] The criterion: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a partition $P$ of $[a,b]$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$.

[L1] $L(f,P) \le \underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,P)$ for every partition $P$; $\underline{\int_a^b} f = \sup \mathcal{L}$ and $\overline{\int_a^b} f = \inf \mathcal{U}$ over the nonempty sets $\mathcal{L}$ of lower sums and $\mathcal{U}$ of upper sums; $f$ is integrable exactly when the two are equal ([[def-darboux-integral]], [[def-darboux-sums]]).

[L2] $\varepsilon$-characterisation of the supremum: if $u = \sup S$ with $S$ nonempty then for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $s \in S$ with $s > u - \varepsilon$ ([[lem-sup-epsilon]]). Dually, if $\ell = \inf S$ then for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $s \in S$ with $s < \ell + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-inf-epsilon]], [[def-infimum]]).

[L3] If $P'$ refines $P$ then $L(f,P) \le L(f,P')$ and $U(f,P') \le U(f,P)$; the common refinement $P_1 \vee P_2$ refines both $P_1$ and $P_2$ ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L4] Ordered-field arithmetic: adding a constant to both sides preserves an inequality, the order is total and transitive, and $t \cdot 2^{-1} > 0$ for $t > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Write $D := \overline{\int_a^b} f - \underline{\int_a^b} f$, a real number with $D \ge 0$ by [L1]; $f$ is integrable exactly when $D = 0$. [L1]

1.2 **The criterion is sufficient.** Assume [A1] and let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. Fix a partition $P$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$. By [L1], $\underline{\int_a^b} f \ge L(f,P)$ and $\overline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,P)$, so $D \le U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$. [A1, L1, L4, choose]

1.3 **The criterion is necessary; this half of the proof is steps 1.3, 2.2 and 3.1, and its symbols are its own.** Assume $f$ is integrable and write $I$ for the common value $\underline{\int_a^b} f = \overline{\int_a^b} f$. Let a real $\eta > 0$ be given; then $\eta \cdot 2^{-1} > 0$ by [L4]. [L1, L4]

2.1 So $0 \le D < \varepsilon$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$. If $D > 0$, taking $\varepsilon := D$ gives $D < D$, which is false; hence $D = 0$ and $f$ is integrable by step 1.1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L4]

2.2 By [L2] applied to $\mathcal{L}$, whose supremum is $I$, there is a partition $P_1$ with $L(f,P_1) > I - \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$; by [L2] applied to $\mathcal{U}$, whose infimum is $I$, there is a partition $P_2$ with $U(f,P_2) < I + \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$. [step 1.3, L1, L2, choose]

3.1 Put $P_{\ast} := P_1 \vee P_2$, which refines both by [L3]. Then $L(f,P_{\ast}) \ge L(f,P_1) > I - \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$ and $U(f,P_{\ast}) \le U(f,P_2) < I + \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$, so $U(f,P_{\ast}) - L(f,P_{\ast}) < \eta$ by [L4]. Since $\eta > 0$ was arbitrary, the criterion holds. [step 2.2, L3, L4]

4.1 Steps 1.2 and 2.1 give the implication from the criterion to integrability, and steps 1.3, 2.2 and 3.1 give the converse; the two halves are independent and use no symbol in common, and together they are the stated equivalence. [step 2.1, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The strict inequality is not essential.** Requiring $U(f,P) - L(f,P) \le \varepsilon$ for every $\varepsilon > 0$ defines the same condition, since a partition working for $\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$ works strictly for $\varepsilon$. Statements below use whichever form is convenient and no consequence turns on the difference.

- **The common refinement is where the two partitions are reconciled.** Step 2.2 produces one partition good for the lower sum and another good for the upper sum, and there is no reason for them to be the same. [[lem-refinement-inequalities]] is exactly what allows a single partition to inherit both properties, and it is the only place in this proof where anything beyond the definitions is used.

- **No choice principle is used.** Steps 1.2, 2.2 and 3.1 instantiate finitely many existential statements, which is ordinary first-order reasoning. See [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]), let $K \ge 0$ be a real with $|f(t)| \le K$ for every
$t \in [a,b]$ ([[def-bounded-set]]), and let $F$ be the integral function of $f$
([[def-the-integral-function]]). Then

$$\bigl|F(y) - F(x)\bigr| \;\le\; K\,|y - x| \qquad \text{for all } x,y \in [a,b] ,$$

that is, $F$ is Lipschitz with constant $K$ on $[a,b]$
([[def-lipschitz-holder-contraction]], [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]]).
Consequently $F$ is uniformly continuous on $[a,b]$
([[def-uniform-continuity-real]]) and hence continuous there
([[def-continuity-real]]).

**No continuity of $f$ is assumed.** This is the strongest regularity of $F$
available before the fundamental theorem, and it is what makes the hypotheses of
that theorem visible as hypotheses: continuity of $f$ at a point buys
differentiability of $F$ there, and integrability alone already buys this much
everywhere.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, an integrable $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $K \ge 0$ with $|f| \le K$ on $[a,b]$, and the integral function $F(x) = \int_a^x f$; points $x,y \in [a,b]$.

[L1] $F(y) - F(x) = \int_x^y f$ for all $x,y \in [a,b]$, in either order ([[def-the-integral-function]]).

[L2] $|f|$ is integrable on every $[p,q] \subseteq [a,b]$ with $p<q$, and $\bigl|\int_p^q f\bigr| \le \int_p^q |f|$ there ([[cor-integrability-of-absolute-values-products-and-lattice-operations]], claims 1 and 3).

[L3] If $u \le w$ pointwise on $[p,q]$ and both are integrable then $\int_p^q u \le \int_p^q w$, and $\int_p^q c = c(q-p)$ for a constant $c$ ([[thm-monotonicity-of-the-integral]], [[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]]).

[L4] With oriented limits, $\int_y^x f = -\int_x^y f$ and $\int_x^x f = 0$ ([[def-oriented-integral]]).

[L5] Absolute value: $|{-t}| = |t|$, $|t| \ge 0$, and $|t| \le c$ follows from $-c \le t \le c$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]]).

[L6] A real function on $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ satisfying $|u(x)-u(x')| \le L|x-x'|$ for all $x,x' \in A$ is Lipschitz with constant $L$ as a map of metric spaces, $\mathbb{R}$ carrying its usual metric; a Lipschitz real function is uniformly continuous, and a uniformly continuous one is continuous ([[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]], clauses 3 and 6, [[def-lipschitz-holder-contraction]], [[thm-metric-regularity-hierarchy]], [[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]).

[L7] Ordered-field arithmetic: the order is total and transitive, and multiplying an inequality by a nonnegative real preserves it ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **The case $x < y$.** By [L1], $F(y)-F(x) = \int_x^y f$, and $[x,y] \subseteq [a,b]$ with $x < y$. [given, L1]

1.2 **The case $x = y$.** Then $F(y)-F(x) = 0$ and $K|y-x| = 0$, so the inequality holds with equality. [L1, L4, L5]

2.1 On $[x,y]$ one has $|f(t)| \le K$ for every $t$, so by [L2] and [L3], $\bigl|\int_x^y f\bigr| \le \int_x^y |f| \le \int_x^y K = K\,(y-x)$. [step 1.1, given, L2, L3]

3.1 Hence $|F(y)-F(x)| \le K(y-x) = K|y-x|$ when $x < y$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L5]

4.1 **The case $y < x$.** Applying step 3.1 to the pair $(y,x)$ gives $|F(x)-F(y)| \le K|x-y|$, and $|F(y)-F(x)| = |F(x)-F(y)|$ with $|y-x| = |x-y|$ by [L5]; so the inequality holds here too. [step 3.1, L5]

5.1 The three cases $x<y$, $x=y$, $y<x$ are exhaustive by [L7], so $|F(y)-F(x)| \le K|y-x|$ for all $x,y \in [a,b]$. [step 1.2, step 3.1, step 4.1, L7]

6.1 By [L6], $F$ is therefore Lipschitz with constant $K$ on $[a,b]$, hence uniformly continuous on $[a,b]$, hence continuous there. [step 5.1, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- **The estimate is written out on both sides of the diagonal.** Hiding the case $y < x$ inside the absolute value would conceal the fact that $\int_x^y f$ is then the *oriented* integral of [[def-oriented-integral]], and that the published inequality $\bigl|\int_p^q f\bigr| \le \int_p^q|f|$ is available only for $p \le q$. Step 4.1 is what pays for that.

- **The constant is any bound on $|f|$, and it need not be sharp.** If $f$ is integrable then it is bounded by definition of the Darboux sums, so some $K$ exists; the theorem is stated with $K$ given rather than existentially, because every later use supplies its own bound.

- **The dictionary lemma is cited on purpose.** Lipschitz and uniform continuity are defined in this library both for real functions and for maps of metric spaces, and [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]] is the single item recording that the two families of notions coincide. Citing it, rather than proving the implication again, is what keeps the library from carrying two notions of continuity.
