## Statement

Let $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $K$ is compact if and only if $K$ is
sequentially compact ([[def-open-cover-r]]).

Neither implication is formal. Both are routed through the characterisation of
compactness by closed and bounded ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]]), and
the forward implication additionally uses Bolzano-Weierstrass
([[thm-bolzano-weierstrass]]). **The backward implication uses the axiom of
countable choice** ([[def-countable-choice]]): twice, once inside
[[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]] when a point of the closure is
turned into a sequence, and once directly in step 2.3, where an unbounded set
supplies one point beyond each natural bound.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Sequences are indexed by $\mathbb{N}$, which contains $0$ ([[def-sequence]]).

[L1] $K$ is compact when every open cover has a finite subcover, and sequentially compact when every sequence with all terms in $K$ has a subsequence converging to a point of $K$ ([[def-open-cover-r]], [[def-subsequential-limit]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L2] $K$ is compact exactly when $K$ is closed and bounded ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]]).

[L3] Bolzano-Weierstrass: a sequence $(x_k)$ of reals for which some $M$ satisfies $|x_k| \le M$ at every index has a subsequence converging to some real ([[thm-bolzano-weierstrass]]).

[L4] A point lies in $\overline{K}$ exactly when some sequence with all terms in $K$ converges to it, and $K$ is closed exactly when $\overline{K} = K$, exactly when $K$ is sequentially closed ([[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L5] $K$ is bounded exactly when there are $\ell, u$ with $\ell \le y \le u$ for all $y \in K$ ([[def-bounded-set]]).

[L6] Countable choice: for a family $(Y_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of nonempty sets there is $f$ with domain $\mathbb{N}$ and $f(k) \in Y_k$ for every $k$ ([[def-countable-choice]]).

[L7] A convergent sequence of reals is bounded ([[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]]); every subsequence of a convergent sequence converges to the same limit ([[lem-subsequence-inherits-limit]]); a sequence has at most one limit ([[lem-limit-unique]]); a strictly increasing $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ satisfies $n_j \ge j$ ([[lem-index-map-grows]]).

[L8] Archimedean property: for every real $z$ there is a natural $j \ge 1$ with $z < j$; canonical naturals satisfy $k \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} \ge 0$ and are increasing in $k$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L9] Absolute value: $|z| \ge z$, $|z| \ge -z$, $|z| \ge 0$, and $|z| = z$ for $z \ge 0$ while $|z| = -z$ for $z < 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L10] Every nonempty finite set of reals has a maximum, which is one of its members ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For the forward implication assume $K$ is compact; then $K$ is closed and bounded by [L2], so [L5] supplies $\ell, u$ with $\ell \le y \le u$ for every $y \in K$. Let $(x_k)$ be any sequence with $x_k \in K$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$. [assume-hyp, L2, L5]

1.2 For the backward implication assume $K$ is sequentially compact. [assume-hyp, L1]

2.1 The sequence of step 1.1 is bounded: put $M := \max\{|\ell|, |u|\}$ by [L10]; for each $k$, from $\ell \le x_k \le u$ we get $x_k \le u \le |u| \le M$ and $-x_k \le -\ell \le |\ell| \le M$, so $|x_k| \le M$ by [L9]. By [L3] there are a strictly increasing $n$ and a real $L$ with $x_{n_j} \to L$; every term $x_{n_j}$ lies in $K$ and $K$ is closed, so $L \in K$ by [L4]. Hence every sequence in $K$ has a subsequence converging in $K$, that is, $K$ is sequentially compact. [step 1.1, L1, L3, L4, L9, L10]

2.2 A sequentially compact $K$ is closed: let $y \in \overline{K}$; by [L4] there is a sequence $(a_k)$ with $a_k \in K$ for all $k$ and $a_k \to y$; by sequential compactness some subsequence $(a_{n_j})$ converges to a point $z \in K$; but that subsequence also converges to $y$ by [L7], and limits are unique by [L7], so $z = y$ and $y \in K$. Hence $\overline{K} \subseteq K$, so $\overline{K} = K$ and $K$ is closed by [L4]. [step 1.2, L1, L4, L7]

2.3 A sequentially compact $K$ is bounded: suppose it is not. Then for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ the set $Y_k := \{\, y \in K : y > k \text{ or } y < -k \,\}$ is nonempty, since $Y_k = \varnothing$ would mean $-k \le y \le k$ for every $y \in K$ and make $K$ bounded by [L5]. Use [L6] to fix $f$ with $f(k) \in Y_k$ and put $x_k := f(k)$; then $x_k \in K$, and $|x_k| > k$ for every $k$, because $x_k > k \ge 0$ gives $|x_k| = x_k > k$ while $x_k < -k \le 0$ gives $|x_k| = -x_k > k$ by [L9] and [L8]. By sequential compactness some subsequence $(x_{n_j})$ converges, hence is bounded by some real $M$ with $|x_{n_j}| \le M$ for all $j$ by [L7]; by [L8] fix a natural $j \ge 1$ with $M < j$, and then $|x_{n_j}| > n_j \ge j > M$ by [L7] and [L8], which contradicts $|x_{n_j}| \le M$. So $K$ is bounded. [step 1.2, L1, L5, L6, L7, L8, L9]

3.1 A sequentially compact $K$ is therefore closed by step 2.2 and bounded by step 2.3, hence compact by [L2]. [step 2.2, step 2.3, L2]

4.1 Step 2.1 is the forward implication and step 3.1 the backward one, so for subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ compactness and sequential compactness coincide. [step 2.1, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The equivalence is proved, not defined, and it is proved through the order.**
  Both directions pass through [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], whose
  backward half needs the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$, and the forward
  direction adds [[thm-bolzano-weierstrass]], whose proof spends completeness
  again. Nothing here transfers to a setting where those are unavailable; see
  [[rem-r-native-topology-scope]].

- **Where the choices are spent, and whether they can be avoided.** Step 2.3
  selects one point of $K$ outside $[-k,k]$ for each $k$, and
  [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]] selects one point of $K$ in
  each shrinking neighbourhood. Both are countably many independent selections
  from subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, for which this library has no canonical rule, so
  [[def-countable-choice]] is invoked rather than worked around. The forward
  implication, step 2.1, makes no such selection: the subsequence comes from
  [[thm-bolzano-weierstrass]] as a single object.

- **Sequential compactness is the form used in analysis; compactness is the form
  that is stated without sequences.** The extraction of a convergent subsequence
  is what proofs about continuous functions on $[a,b]$ actually use, while the
  covering definition mentions no sequence and no limit. This theorem is what
  lets a reader move between them for subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, and it is proved
  only there.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ denotes the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a subset of it.

The notions **upper bound** and **bounded above** are already fixed by
[[def-complete-ordered-field]] and are only recalled here, never redefined:
$u \in \mathbb{R}$ is an *upper bound* of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$, and
$S$ is *bounded above* if it has at least one upper bound. The dual notions are:

- $\ell \in \mathbb{R}$ is a **lower bound** of $S$ if $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.
- $S$ is **bounded below** if it has at least one lower bound.
- $S$ is **bounded** if it is both bounded above and bounded below, that is, if
  there are $\ell, u \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\ell \le s \le u$ for every $s \in S$.

## Remarks

- A bound is an element of $\mathbb{R}$ and is not required to lie in $S$. A
  bound that does lie in $S$ is a maximum or a minimum ([[def-max-min]]), and
  that is a strictly stronger condition ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Bounds come in half-lines: if $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$ then so is every
  $\ell'' \le \ell$, and if $u$ is an upper bound then so is every $u'' \ge u$.
  Consequently a set that has one bound of a given kind has infinitely many, and
  the interesting question is whether the collection of them has a best element,
  which is what a supremum ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) or an infimum
  ([[def-infimum]]) is.
- Bounded above and bounded below are independent conditions. The set
  $A = \{\, n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} : n \ge 1 \,\}$ of canonical naturals of
  $\mathbb{R}$ is bounded below by $0$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]) and is not
  bounded above ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); its reflection $-A$ is bounded above
  and not bounded below ([[lem-reflection]]).
- The empty set is bounded, and vacuously so: every real number is both an upper
  bound and a lower bound of $\emptyset$, since the defining condition quantifies
  over no elements. Having bounds is therefore much weaker than having a least
  upper bound or a greatest lower bound ([[fs-every-set-has-sup]]).

## Definition

The **Axiom of Countable Choice**, written $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$, is the following
statement.

> For every family $(X_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of nonempty sets indexed by
> $\mathbb{N}$ there is a function $f$ with domain $\mathbb{N}$ such that
> $f(n) \in X_n$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

Equivalently, in the vocabulary of [[def-choice-function]]: every at most
countable family of nonempty sets ([[def-countable]]) has a choice function.

## Remarks

- **The two formulations are equivalent, and the passage between them uses no
  choice.** Given an at most countable family $\mathcal{F}$ of nonempty sets,
  either $\mathcal{F} = \varnothing$, where the empty function is a choice
  function, or a surjection $s : \mathbb{N} \to \mathcal{F}$ exists
  ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]]); applying the indexed form to
  $X_n := s(n)$ gives $f$ with $f(n) \in s(n)$, and
  $g(S) := f(\min\{\, n : s(n) = S \,\})$ is a choice function for $\mathcal{F}$,
  the minimum being canonical by [[thm-well-ordering-principle]]. Conversely a
  choice function $g$ on the at most countable family $\{\, X_n : n \in \mathbb{N} \,\}$
  gives $f(n) := g(X_n)$.

- **$\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ is strictly weaker than the Axiom of Choice**
  ([[def-axiom-of-choice]]): AC implies it immediately, since AC applies to every
  family, while it is consistent with ZF that $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ holds and AC
  fails. **It is also strictly stronger than what ZF proves**: it is consistent
  with ZF that $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ fails, as Cohen's first model shows, since an
  infinite set of reals with no countably infinite subset
  ([[rem-cohen-first-model]]) is already a failure of $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$; the
  Feferman-Levy model ([[rem-feferman-levy-model]]) is a second witness. Both
  statements are conditional on the consistency of ZF and are external results,
  established by forcing and by permutation models; they are recorded here with
  references and are **not** proved in this library, which contains neither
  technique. Of the two, only the failure of $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ is recorded in
  this library's catalogue of unproved results; the separation of
  $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ from AC in the other direction is quoted from the
  references alone.

- **Dependent choice sits between them.** The Axiom of Dependent Choice
  (DC) says that if $R$ is a relation on a nonempty set $X$ such that every
  $x \in X$ has some $y$ with $x \mathbin{R} y$, then there is a sequence
  $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ with $x_n \mathbin{R} x_{n+1}$ for all $n$. In ZF,
  $\mathrm{AC} \Rightarrow \mathrm{DC} \Rightarrow \mathrm{AC}_\omega$; both
  implications are theorems of ZF, and neither is proved here. That neither
  reverses is a pair of relative-consistency results of the same kind as in the
  previous bullet: if ZF is consistent, then so are ZF + DC + (not AC) and
  ZF + $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ + (not DC). Both are established by forcing and by
  permutation models, are quoted here from the references rather than proved, and
  cannot be stated without the consistency hypothesis; so "DC is *strictly*
  between AC and $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$" is shorthand for those two conditional
  statements and is never used here as a standalone assertion. DC is the
  principle that legitimises "choose $x_0$, then choose $x_1$ depending on
  $x_0$, and so on"; $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ only legitimises countably many
  *independent* choices made at once.

- **Being an axiom, $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ carries no well-definedness obligation**,
  which is why this item has no `justified_by`. Its role in this library is
  bookkeeping: [[thm-countable-union-of-countable]] assumes it and flags the exact
  step that spends it, and [[fs-countable-union-theorem-of-zf]] records that the
  assumption cannot be removed.

- Every result *proved* on this page other than
  [[thm-countable-union-of-countable]] is a theorem of ZF alone. In particular
  [[lem-subset-of-countable]], [[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]],
  [[thm-schroder-bernstein]], [[thm-rationals-countable]], [[thm-cantor-powerset]]
  and [[thm-r-uncountable]] are choice free, and each says so. The false
  statements at the end of the page are not all of that kind, and the claim above
  does not cover them: two of the three refute a ZF-provability claim only under
  the hypothesis that ZF is consistent, quoting an external independence result
  rather than proving it, and they say so in their own Facts.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with open and closed sets as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

- The **interior** of $A$ is the union of all open subsets of $A$:
  $$A^{\circ} \;:=\; \bigcup \{\, U \subseteq \mathbb{R} : U \text{ open and } U \subseteq A \,\}.$$
- The **closure** of $A$ is the intersection of all closed supersets of $A$:
  $$\overline{A} \;:=\; \bigcap \{\, F \subseteq \mathbb{R} : F \text{ closed and } A \subseteq F \,\}.$$
- The **boundary** of $A$ is $\partial A := \overline{A} \setminus A^{\circ}$.
- The **exterior** of $A$ is $\operatorname{ext} A := (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)^{\circ}$.

**Both operators are well defined and deliver what their names claim.** The
family whose union defines $A^{\circ}$ always contains $\varnothing$, and the
family whose intersection defines $\overline{A}$ always contains $\mathbb{R}$,
so the second family is nonempty and both expressions denote subsets of
$\mathbb{R}$ without appeal to any convention about empty unions or
intersections. Moreover:

- $A^{\circ}$ is **open**, being a union of open sets
  ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], claim 1), and $A^{\circ} \subseteq A$, since
  every set in the family is a subset of $A$. It is therefore the **largest**
  open subset of $A$: any open $U \subseteq A$ is a member of the family and so
  $U \subseteq A^{\circ}$.
- $\overline{A}$ is **closed**, being an intersection of a nonempty family of
  closed sets ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], claim 3), and $A \subseteq
  \overline{A}$, since every set in the family contains $A$. It is therefore the
  **smallest** closed superset of $A$: any closed $F \supseteq A$ is a member of
  the family and so $\overline{A} \subseteq F$.

**Pointwise description of the interior.** For $x \in \mathbb{R}$,

$$x \in A^{\circ} \iff \text{there is } \varepsilon > 0 \text{ with } N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A .$$

If $x \in A^{\circ}$ then, $A^{\circ}$ being open and containing $x$, there is
$\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A^{\circ} \subseteq A$.
Conversely if $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A$ then $N_\varepsilon(x)$ is an open
subset of $A$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) containing $x$, hence
$x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A^{\circ}$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

The corresponding pointwise description of the closure is not a definitional
matter and is proved separately, as [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

## Remarks

- **The four sets partition nothing by themselves, but three of them do.** For
  every $A$ the three sets $A^{\circ}$, $\partial A$ and $\operatorname{ext} A$
  are pairwise disjoint with union $\mathbb{R}$. This is not proved here and is
  not used on this page; what is used is only the definitions above and the
  characterisations of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

- **Interior and closure are dual.** Complementation exchanges the two families
  above, since $U$ is open exactly when $\mathbb{R} \setminus U$ is closed, so
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus A^{\circ} = \overline{\mathbb{R} \setminus A}$ and
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A} = (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)^{\circ} =
  \operatorname{ext} A$. The second identity is the reason the exterior is
  usually described as "the complement of the closure".

- **$A$ is open exactly when $A = A^{\circ}$, and closed exactly when
  $A = \overline{A}$.** For the first: $A^{\circ} \subseteq A$ always, and
  $A \subseteq A^{\circ}$ holds exactly when $A$ is one of the open subsets of
  $A$, that is, exactly when $A$ is open. The closure half is the same argument
  read the other way, and it is recorded as a claim of
  [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] because the rest of that theorem needs it.

- **Boundary points may or may not belong to the set.** $\partial (0,1) =
  \partial [0,1] = \{0,1\}$, and the two boundary points lie outside the first
  set and inside the second; the boundary sees only the way the set meets its
  complement, not which side the edge is assigned to.

## Definition

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $m \in \mathbb{R}$.

- $m$ is a **maximum** (or *greatest element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $s \le m$
  for every $s \in S$.
- $m$ is a **minimum** (or *least element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $m \le s$
  for every $s \in S$.

A set has at most one maximum: if $m_1$ and $m_2$ are both maxima then
$m_1 \in S$ gives $m_1 \le m_2$ and $m_2 \in S$ gives $m_2 \le m_1$, so
$m_1 = m_2$ by antisymmetry of the order, which is immediate from the trichotomy
axiom of an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).
The same argument applies to minima, so we may write $\max S$ and $\min S$.

## Remarks

- A maximum is precisely an upper bound of $S$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]])
  that happens to lie in $S$; a minimum is a lower bound of $S$
  ([[def-bounded-set]]) that lies in $S$. In particular a set with a maximum is
  bounded above and a set with a minimum is bounded below.
- The empty set has neither a maximum nor a minimum, because the requirement
  $m \in S$ cannot be met.
- The membership requirement $m \in S$ is exactly what separates a maximum from a
  supremum, and it is the theme of this page. A supremum is a bound on the set
  and is not asked to belong to it; a maximum is an element of the set. The two
  agree exactly when the supremum happens to be attained ([[lem-max-is-sup]]),
  and they genuinely differ in general ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has both a maximum and a minimum
  ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]), which is what licenses the notation
  $\max\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$. Infinite sets need not: the failure of attainment is
  an infinitary phenomenon.

## Definition

Let $U, F \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]].

- $U$ is **open** when for every $x \in U$ there is a real $\varepsilon > 0$
  with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$.
- $F$ is **closed** when its complement $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open.
- A set is **clopen** when it is both open and closed.

The whole of the topology of $\mathbb{R}$ developed on this page rests on this
one definition: closedness is *defined* as openness of the complement, and every
other description of a closed set on this page is a theorem
([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]]).

**$\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen.** The condition defining openness
quantifies over the elements of the set, so it holds vacuously for
$\varnothing$; and for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ one has $N_1(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$,
so $\mathbb{R}$ is open. Since each of the two is the complement of the other,
each is also closed.

**Every neighbourhood is open.** Let $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and put
$\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x|$, which is $> 0$ because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$. The nesting property of [[def-neighbourhood-r]] gives
$N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$. So every point of $N_\varepsilon(x)$
has a neighbourhood inside it.

**The four open forms of [[def-interval]] are open sets.** Let $a, b \in
\mathbb{R}$.

- $(a,b)$: for $x$ with $a < x < b$, both $x - a > 0$ and $b - x > 0$, so
  $\delta := \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ is a positive real (the minimum of a
  two-element set of reals exists, [[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).
  If $|y - x| < \delta$ then $y > x - \delta \ge x - (x - a) = a$ and
  $y < x + \delta \le x + (b - x) = b$, so $y \in (a,b)$; hence
  $N_\delta(x) \subseteq (a,b)$.
- $(a,\infty)$: for $x > a$ take $\delta := x - a > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y > x - \delta = a$.
- $(-\infty,b)$: for $x < b$ take $\delta := b - x > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y < x + \delta = b$.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: already treated above.

**The four closed forms of [[def-interval]] are closed sets.** In each case the
complement is shown open directly.

- $[a,b]$: if $x \notin [a,b]$ then $x < a$ or $x > b$ by trichotomy
  ([[def-ordered-field]]). If $x < a$, take $\delta := a - x > 0$; every
  $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has $y < x + \delta = a$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. If
  $x > b$, take $\delta := x - b > 0$; every $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has
  $y > x - \delta = b$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. So
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus [a,b]$ is open.
- $[a,\infty)$: its complement is $(-\infty,a)$, which is open by the previous
  paragraph.
- $(-\infty,b]$: its complement is $(b,\infty)$, which is open.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: its complement is $\varnothing$, which is
  open.

## Remarks

- **Open and closed are not opposites, and not exhaustive.** A set may be
  neither: the half-open interval $[0,1)$ is neither open nor closed
  ([[fs-every-set-is-open-or-closed]]). A set may be both: $\varnothing$ and
  $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen. The words are inherited from the interval terminology
  of [[def-interval]], and the agreement between the two usages is exactly the
  two lists verified above: an interval called open there is an open set here,
  and an interval called closed there is a closed set here.

- **A clopen set is a disconnection waiting to happen.** If $A$ is clopen and
  both $A$ and $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ are nonempty, then each of the two is
  its own closure, so the two are separated in the sense of
  [[def-connected-r]] and $\mathbb{R} = A \cup (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)$ is a
  disconnection. Since $\mathbb{R}$ is order-convex it is connected
  ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]]), so no such $A$ exists:
  $\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are the only clopen subsets of $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The half-open forms are the ones the two lists omit**, and deliberately so:
  $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ with $a < b$ are neither open nor closed as subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The radius depends on the point.** Openness asks for *some* $\varepsilon$
  at each point, and that $\varepsilon$ may shrink to nothing as the point
  approaches the edge of the set, as the computation for $(a,b)$ shows: there
  $\delta = \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ tends to $0$ as $x$ tends to either endpoint.
  Asking instead for a single $\varepsilon$ that works simultaneously at every
  point of the set is a strictly stronger condition, and it is not what is
  defined here; nothing on this page uses it.

## Definition

Let $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with open sets as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

- An **open cover** of $K$ is a family $\mathcal{U}$ of open subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$ with $K \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{U}$.
- A **subcover** of $\mathcal{U}$ is a subfamily $\mathcal{V} \subseteq
  \mathcal{U}$ that is still an open cover of $K$.
- A subfamily $\mathcal{V} \subseteq \mathcal{U}$ is **finite** when
  $\mathcal{V} = \varnothing$ or there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and members
  $U_0, \dots, U_n$ of $\mathcal{U}$ with $\mathcal{V} = \{U_0, \dots, U_n\}$;
  repetitions in the list are allowed and harmless.
- $K$ is **compact** when every open cover of $K$ has a finite subcover:
  for every open cover $\mathcal{U}$ of $K$, either $K = \varnothing$ and the
  empty subfamily covers it, or there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
  $U_0, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{U}$ with
  $$K \subseteq U_0 \cup \dots \cup U_n .$$
- $K$ is **sequentially compact** when every sequence $(x_k)$ of reals with
  $x_k \in K$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-sequence]]) has a subsequence
  converging ([[def-real-limit]]) to some point of $K$; equivalently, when every
  such sequence has a subsequential limit ([[def-subsequential-limit]]) that
  lies in $K$.

**Compactness is a property of $K$ alone.** The covering families range over open
subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, not over sets open in some other ambient space, so the
notion defined here is compactness of $K$ as a subset of $\mathbb{R}$. Nothing
below relativises it to a smaller ambient field; where an ordered field other
than $\mathbb{R}$ is meant, as in
[[fs-closed-bounded-compact-without-completeness]], the whole vocabulary is set
up again there for that field.

**$\varnothing$ is compact and sequentially compact.** The empty subfamily covers
it, and there is no sequence with all terms in $\varnothing$, so both conditions
hold vacuously.

## Remarks

- **Why "finite" is spelled out by listing.** A finite subfamily is described
  here as one that can be written $\{U_0, \dots, U_n\}$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}$,
  which is exactly the form every proof on this page produces or consumes: the
  bisection argument of [[thm-heine-borel-r]] produces a one-member list, and
  the arguments of [[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]] consume a list by
  taking a maximum over it ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]). Since $\mathbb{N}$
  contains $0$, the shortest nonempty list is $\{U_0\}$.

- **The two notions are not defined to be equivalent, and their equivalence is a
  theorem.** For subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ it is
  [[thm-compact-iff-sequentially-compact-r]]; both of its implications run
  through the characterisation of compactness by closed and bounded, and its
  forward implication additionally uses Bolzano-Weierstrass. Neither implication
  is formal.

- **Compactness is not inherited by subsets, but by closed subsets.** A closed
  subset of a compact set is compact, which is immediate from
  [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]] once that is available, whereas
  $(0,1) \subseteq [0,1]$ shows that an arbitrary subset of a compact set need
  not be compact.

- **The empty cover.** If $K \ne \varnothing$ then no open cover of $K$ is
  empty, so the case distinction in the definition of compactness only ever
  matters for $K = \varnothing$; it is written out so that the definition does
  not quietly assume $K$ nonempty.

A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals **converges** to $x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]],
[[def-real-numbers]]) with its order and absolute value ([[def-real-order]]), and
$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers with its order ([[def-natural-numbers]],
[[def-nat-order]]).

A **sequence of reals** is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$. We write
$x_k$ for the value $x(k)$, call it the **$k$-th term**, and write $(x_k)$, or
$(x_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$, for the function itself. The **range** of $(x_k)$ is
the subset $\{\, x_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals and let $P$ be a property of indices.

- $(x_k)$ is **bounded** if there is $M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for
  every $k \in \mathbb{N}$; it is **unbounded** otherwise.
- $P$ holds **eventually** if there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $P(k)$ holds
  for every $k \ge K$.
- $P$ holds **frequently** if for every $K \in \mathbb{N}$ there is some
  $k \ge K$ for which $P(k)$ holds.
- For $K \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$K$-th tail** of $(x_k)$ is the sequence
  $x^{(K)}$ defined by $x^{(K)}_j := x_{j + K}$ for $j \in \mathbb{N}$; it is
  again a sequence of reals.
- A function $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is **strictly increasing** if
  $n_j < n_k$ whenever $j < k$. For such an $n$, the **subsequence** of $(x_k)$
  along $n$ is the composite $x \circ n$, written $(x_{n_k})_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$;
  it is again a sequence of reals.

**Convergence and Cauchyness are not defined here.** They are already fixed, for
sequences of reals, by the published [[def-real-limit]]: $(x_k)$ *converges* to
$x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is
$K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$, and $(x_k)$
is *Cauchy* when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$
with $|x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$. This page builds the
toolkit for those two notions and does not restate them. A sequence
**converges** if it converges to some real, and **diverges** if it does not.

## Remarks

- **Identification of $\mathbb{Q}$ with its image.** The map $q \mapsto \hat q$
  is an embedding of ordered fields ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and as is
  standard we write $q$ for $\hat q$, so that a rational may be compared with a
  real without further comment. [[def-real-limit]] is stated with the hat; every
  rational $\varepsilon$ occurring on this page is its image under this
  embedding.

- **Rational and real $\varepsilon$ agree.** [[def-real-limit]] tests convergence
  against every *rational* $\varepsilon > 0$, and its own remark records that
  this loses nothing. Spelled out: suppose that for every rational
  $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all
  $k \ge K$, and let $\eta > 0$ be an arbitrary *real*. Since $0 < \eta$,
  density of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) supplies a
  rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, and the index $K$
  belonging to that $\varepsilon$ satisfies $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon < \eta$ for
  all $k \ge K$. The converse implication is immediate, since every positive
  rational is a positive real. So the two formulations define the same relation,
  and the same two lines apply verbatim to the Cauchy condition and to any
  condition of the shape "for every $\varepsilon > 0$, eventually
  $\cdots < \varepsilon$". Proofs on this page therefore run the test with a real
  $\varepsilon$ wherever that is more convenient, and say so by citing this
  remark; nothing is smuggled in.

- **Constant sequences converge.** For $c \in \mathbb{R}$ the constant sequence
  $x_k := c$ converges to $c$, because $|x_k - c| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ for
  every $\varepsilon > 0$ and every $k$; it is bounded by $|c|$.

- **Eventually and frequently are dual.** $P$ holds frequently exactly when
  $\lnot P$ does not hold eventually, and $P$ holds eventually exactly when
  $\lnot P$ does not hold frequently. So the two quantifier patterns are
  negations of one another applied to the complementary property, and there is no
  third pattern hiding between them.

- **A sequence is not its range.** $(x_k)$ is a function, not a set, and the
  range does not determine the function: the sequence $x_0 = 0$, $x_k = 1$ for
  $k \ge 1$ and the sequence $y_0 = y_1 = 0$, $y_k = 1$ for $k \ge 2$ have the
  same range $\{0, 1\}$, yet they differ at $k = 1$, so they are different
  sequences. Order and repetition are part of the data and the range forgets
  both. Boundedness, on the other hand, depends only on the range.

- **Indexing.** Sequences here start at $k = 0$ because $\mathbb{N}$ contains
  $0$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]). Texts that index from $1$ describe the same
  objects up to a shift, and the shift changes nothing about convergence, by
  [[lem-limit-of-tail]].

## Definition

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]) and let $L \in \mathbb{R}$.
Then $L$ is a **subsequential limit** of $(x_k)$ when some subsequence of $(x_k)$
converges to $L$: that is, when there is a strictly increasing
$n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that

$$x_{n_j} \longrightarrow L \qquad (j \to \infty)$$

in the sense of [[def-real-limit]]. The **subsequential limit set** of $(x_k)$ is

$$\operatorname{SL}(x) \;:=\; \{\, L \in \mathbb{R} : L \text{ is a subsequential limit of } (x_k) \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}.$$

Both pieces of the definition are already fixed elsewhere and are only combined
here: *strictly increasing* and *subsequence* are [[def-sequence]], and
*converges* is [[def-real-limit]]. Nothing about $(x_k)$ itself is assumed; in
particular $(x_k)$ is not assumed to converge, and $\operatorname{SL}(x)$ may be
empty, a single point, or larger.

**A subsequence looks arbitrarily far out.** A strictly increasing index map
satisfies $n_j \ge j$ for every $j$ ([[lem-index-map-grows]]), so the indices
$n_j$ are cofinal in $\mathbb{N}$ and a subsequential limit is determined by the
behaviour of $(x_k)$ at arbitrarily large indices. Consequently no finite
initial segment of $(x_k)$ affects $\operatorname{SL}(x)$: a sequence and each of
its tails have the same subsequential limits.

**Terminology.** Some texts say *cluster point*, *limit point* or *accumulation
value* of the sequence for the same notion. This library says *subsequential
limit* throughout, reserving *limit point* for the topological notion of a limit
point of a set, which is a different thing: the set $\{x_k\}$ of values of the
constant sequence $x_k = 0$ has no limit point, while $0$ is a subsequential
limit of that sequence.

## Remarks

- **A convergent sequence has exactly one subsequential limit, its limit.** If
  $x_k \to x$ then every subsequence converges to $x$
  ([[lem-subsequence-inherits-limit]]), so every subsequential limit equals $x$
  by uniqueness of limits ([[lem-limit-unique]]); and $x$ itself is one, taking
  $n_j = j$, which is strictly increasing. So $\operatorname{SL}(x) = \{x\}$. The
  converse fails: $\operatorname{SL}$ being a single point does not force
  convergence, as the unbounded sequence of
  [[cex-unbounded-with-convergent-subsequence]] shows.

- **The subsequential limit set can be empty.** The sequence $x_k = k$ has no
  subsequential limit at all, since every subsequence is unbounded and an
  unbounded sequence does not converge ([[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]]).
  Bolzano-Weierstrass ([[thm-bolzano-weierstrass]]) says exactly that
  boundedness is what rules this out: for a bounded sequence,
  $\operatorname{SL}(x) \ne \emptyset$.

- **It can also be large.** The alternating sequence of
  [[lem-alternating-sequence]] has subsequential limit set $\{-1, 1\}$, and
  [[ex-two-subsequential-limits]] carries out that computation for a sequence
  that converges to neither. The systematic study of $\operatorname{SL}(x)$, in
  particular that it has a greatest and a least element for a bounded sequence,
  belongs to the $\limsup$ page and is not begun here.

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals converging to $x \in \mathbb{R}$
([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]). Then $(x_k)$ is bounded: there is
$M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals converging to a real $x$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L1] Convergence: for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$ ([[def-real-limit]]); and $1$ is a rational $> 0$, since $\mathbb{Q}$ is an ordered field ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and $0 < 1$ in every ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] Triangle inequality: $|a + b| \le |a| + |b|$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Absolute value: $|u| \ge 0$ for every real $u$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L4] Finite maxima: for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and all reals $a_0, \dots, a_n$ the set $\{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$ has a maximum ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]); a maximum lies in the set and dominates every element of it ([[def-max-min]]).

[L5] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: transitivity of $\le$ and of $<$; both mixed forms, $u < v \le w \Rightarrow u < w$ and $u \le v < w \Rightarrow u < w$, and the implication $u < v \Rightarrow u \le v$, all immediate from the reading of $u \le v$ as "$u < v$ or $u = v$" ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]); and translation invariance, $a < b \Rightarrow a + c < b + c$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

[L6] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total, so every index $k$ satisfies $k < K$ or $k \ge K$ ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Apply convergence with the rational $\varepsilon = 1$: fix $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $|x_k - x| < 1$ for all $k \ge K$. [L1]

2.1 For every $k \ge K$ we have $|x_k| = |(x_k - x) + x| \le |x_k - x| + |x|$, while adding $|x|$ to both sides of $|x_k - x| < 1$ gives $|x_k - x| + |x| < 1 + |x| = |x| + 1$; composing the non-strict inequality with the strict one yields $|x_k| < |x| + 1$. [step 1.1, L2, L5]

2.2 Define $M := \max\{\, |x_0|, |x_1|, \dots, |x_{K-1}|, |x| + 1 \,\}$, the maximum of the finite list obtained by appending $|x| + 1$ to the first $K$ values $|x_0|, \dots, |x_{K-1}|$; the list is nonempty because its last entry is always present (when $K = 0$ the list is the single entry $|x| + 1$), so the maximum exists by [L4]. [step 1.1, L4, choose]

3.1 For every $k < K$ the value $|x_k|$ is one of the entries of that list, hence $|x_k| \le M$. [step 2.2, L4]

3.2 For every $k \ge K$ we have $|x_k| < |x| + 1 \le M$, since $|x| + 1$ is an entry of the list, hence $|x_k| \le M$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L4, L5]

4.1 Every index satisfies $k < K$ or $k \ge K$, and in both cases $|x_k| \le M$; therefore $(x_k)$ is bounded. [step 3.1, step 3.2, L3, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- This is where [[lem-finite-set-has-max]] does its main work on this page: the first $K$ terms are bounded because a nonempty finite set of reals has a maximum, and that fact is proved once, by induction, rather than re-derived here. It is not the only consumer, and no claim of uniqueness is made: [[lem-null-times-bounded]] and [[rem-sequence-conventions]] cite the same lemma, each for a maximum of finitely many reals.

- The converse is false. A bounded sequence need not converge ([[fs-bounded-implies-convergent]]). What is true in that direction is the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, which requires a passage to a subsequence; it is **not available at this point in the reading order**, being the subject of the next page of this track, *Monotone Sequences, Bolzano-Weierstrass, and Cauchy Completeness*, where it is proved.

- Boundedness is exactly what makes [[lem-null-times-bounded]] applicable to a convergent factor, and that is how boundedness enters the product rule of [[thm-algebra-of-limits]].

## Statement

For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and all $a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n \in \mathbb{R}$, the
set $\{a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ has a maximum and a minimum ([[def-max-min]]).

What is proved below is exactly the displayed statement, by induction on $n$.

The usual reading, that *every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has a
maximum and a minimum*, follows once one identifies the nonempty finite subsets
of $\mathbb{R}$ with the sets listable as $\{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$. That
identification is recorded as a stipulation in the Given below, because this page
has no definition of finiteness to prove it against. **It is discharged, not
merely assumed**: [[lem-finite-subsets-listable]] proves that the two
descriptions of a nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ agree. That lemma is
recorded in `justified_by` rather than in `deps`, since it is about the sets this
lemma quantifies over and therefore depends on this one. This is what licenses
the notation
$\max\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ and $\min\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ for finite sets of
**real** numbers from this page onwards.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Real numbers $a_0, a_1, a_2, \dots$; for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write $F_n := \{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$, so that $F_{n+1} = F_n \cup \{a_{n+1}\}$. A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and finite exactly when it equals $F_n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and some choice of $a_0, \dots, a_n$.

[A1] $P(n)$ denotes the statement: for all $a_0, \dots, a_n \in \mathbb{R}$, the set $F_n$ has a maximum and a minimum.

[L1] Maximum and minimum: $m = \max X$ means $m \in X$ and $x \le m$ for all $x \in X$; $m = \min X$ means $m \in X$ and $m \le x$ for all $x \in X$; each is unique when it exists ([[def-max-min]]).

[L2] Induction principle: if $P(0)$ holds and $P(n)$ implies $P(n+1)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $P(n)$ holds for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, where $n + 1$ denotes the successor $\sigma(n)$ ([[thm-induction-principle]], [[def-nat-addition]]).

[L3] The order on $\mathbb{R}$ is reflexive, total and transitive: $a \le a$; for all $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds, so at least one of $a \le b$ and $b \le a$ holds; and $a \le b$ with $b \le c$ gives $a \le c$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case: $F_0 = \{a_0\}$, and $a_0 \in F_0$ with $a_0 \le a_0$ by reflexivity, so $a_0$ is both a maximum and a minimum of $F_0$; hence $P(0)$ holds. [base, A1, L1, L3]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume $P(n)$, that is, for all reals $a_0, \dots, a_n$ the set $F_n$ has a maximum and a minimum. [ih, A1]

2.1 Let $a_0, \dots, a_{n+1} \in \mathbb{R}$ be arbitrary; by the inductive hypothesis the set $F_n$ has a maximum $M$ and a minimum $m$, and $F_{n+1} = F_n \cup \{a_{n+1}\}$. [step 1.2, L1]

3.1 By totality at least one of $a_{n+1} \le M$ and $M \le a_{n+1}$ holds. If $a_{n+1} \le M$, then $M \in F_n \subseteq F_{n+1}$, every element of $F_n$ is $\le M$ because $M = \max F_n$, and $a_{n+1} \le M$ as well, so $M$ is a maximum of $F_{n+1}$. If $M \le a_{n+1}$, then $a_{n+1} \in F_{n+1}$, every $x \in F_n$ satisfies $x \le M \le a_{n+1}$ hence $x \le a_{n+1}$ by transitivity, and $a_{n+1} \le a_{n+1}$, so $a_{n+1}$ is a maximum of $F_{n+1}$. Either way $F_{n+1}$ has a maximum. [step 2.1, L1, L3]

3.2 Dually, at least one of $m \le a_{n+1}$ and $a_{n+1} \le m$ holds. If $m \le a_{n+1}$, then $m \in F_{n+1}$ and every element of $F_{n+1}$ is $\ge m$, so $m$ is a minimum of $F_{n+1}$. If $a_{n+1} \le m$, then $a_{n+1} \in F_{n+1}$ and every $x \in F_n$ satisfies $a_{n+1} \le m \le x$ hence $a_{n+1} \le x$ by transitivity, so $a_{n+1}$ is a minimum of $F_{n+1}$. Either way $F_{n+1}$ has a minimum. [step 2.1, L1, L3]

4.1 Since $a_0, \dots, a_{n+1}$ were arbitrary, $F_{n+1}$ has a maximum and a minimum for every such list, that is, $P(n)$ implies $P(n+1)$. [step 3.1, step 3.2, A1]

5.1 The base case and the inductive step give $P(n)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ by the induction principle; since a nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is exactly a set of the form $F_n$, every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has both a maximum and a minimum. [step 1.1, step 4.1, given, L2, discharge-induction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the stipulation is discharged.** Finiteness itself is defined later, in [[def-countable]], as equinumerosity with a von Neumann natural; with that definition in hand [[lem-finite-subsets-listable]] proves that a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and finite exactly when it is listable as $\{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$, which is the Given below. So nothing on this page rests on an assumption that is never paid for; it is paid for later, and the payment is recorded in `justified_by`.
- **Only the total order is used, never completeness.** The base case needs reflexivity, the inductive step needs totality and transitivity, and the induction itself runs over $\mathbb{N}$. The same induction works in any totally ordered field; what is recorded here is its specialisation to $\mathbb{R}$.
- Nonemptiness is essential: $\emptyset$ is finite and has no maximum ([[def-max-min]]). Finiteness is essential too: $\{x \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < x < 1\}$ is bounded and has no maximum ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Combined with claim 1 of [[lem-max-is-sup]], this says every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has a supremum, and that the supremum is attained, because it equals the maximum. The infimum half is *not* part of [[lem-max-is-sup]], which speaks only of maxima and suprema; it follows from the minimum proved here together with the reflection identity $\inf X = -\sup(-X)$ ([[lem-reflection]], [[thm-infimum-property]]).

## Statement

Let $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ be a function, written $k \mapsto n_k$, and
recall that $n$ is **strictly increasing** when $n_j < n_k$ whenever $j < k$
([[def-sequence]], [[def-nat-order]]).

1. **Consecutive comparisons suffice.** If $n_i < n_{\sigma(i)}$ for every
   $i \in \mathbb{N}$, then $n$ is strictly increasing.
2. **Growth.** If $n$ is strictly increasing then $n_k \ge k$ for every
   $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

Claim 1 is what one checks in practice when exhibiting a subsequence; claim 2 is
what every later subsequence argument uses.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A function $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$, written $k \mapsto n_k$, with $\sigma$ the successor and the order of [[def-nat-order]]; claim 1 is proved under the standing assumption that $n_i < n_{\sigma(i)}$ for every $i$, and claim 2 under the standing assumption that $n$ is strictly increasing ([[def-sequence]]).

[A1] $Q(k)$ denotes the statement: $n_j < n_k$ for every $j < k$.

[A2] $P(k)$ denotes the statement: $n_k \ge k$.

[L1] Order and successor on $\mathbb{N}$: $m \le p$ means $m + i = p$ for some $i$, so $0 \le m$ for every $m$ because $0 + m = m$; and $\sigma(k) = k + 1$ with $\sigma(k) \ne k$, so $k < \sigma(k)$ ([[def-nat-order]], [[def-nat-addition]], [[lem-nat-add-identity]], [[lem-nat-successor-neq-self]]).

[L2] Discreteness: $m < p$ if and only if $\sigma(m) \le p$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]).

[L3] Induction principle: if $R(0)$ holds and $R(k)$ implies $R(\sigma(k))$ for every $k$, then $R(k)$ holds for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L4] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive and total, and satisfies trichotomy ([[thm-nat-linear-order]], [[lem-nat-trichotomy]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case for claim 1: $Q(0)$ holds vacuously, since no $j$ satisfies $j < 0$; indeed $0 \le j$ always holds, and $j < 0$ together with $0 \le j$ would contradict antisymmetry. [base, A1, L1, L4]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis for claim 1: fix $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume $Q(k)$, that is $n_j < n_k$ for every $j < k$. [ih, A1]

1.3 Base case for claim 2: $P(0)$ states $n_0 \ge 0$, which holds because $0 \le m$ for every natural $m$. [base, A2, L1]

1.4 Inductive hypothesis for claim 2: fix $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume $P(k)$, that is $k \le n_k$. [ih, A2]

2.1 Inductive step for claim 1: let $j < \sigma(k)$. By trichotomy either $k < j$, or $j = k$, or $j < k$. The case $k < j$ is impossible, since it gives $\sigma(k) \le j$ by [L2], which together with $j < \sigma(k)$ contradicts antisymmetry. If $j = k$ then $n_j = n_k < n_{\sigma(k)}$ by the standing assumption. If $j < k$ then $n_j < n_k$ by step 1.2 and $n_k < n_{\sigma(k)}$ by the standing assumption, so $n_j < n_{\sigma(k)}$ by transitivity. In every admissible case $n_j < n_{\sigma(k)}$, so $Q(\sigma(k))$ holds. [step 1.2, A1, L2, L4]

2.2 Inductive step for claim 2: $k < \sigma(k)$ by [L1], so strict increase gives $n_k < n_{\sigma(k)}$; combined with $k \le n_k$ from step 1.4 this yields $k < n_{\sigma(k)}$, hence $\sigma(k) \le n_{\sigma(k)}$ by [L2], which is $P(\sigma(k))$. [step 1.4, A2, L1, L2, L4]

3.1 Both inductions are complete, so by the induction principle $Q(k)$ holds for every $k$, which is claim 1, and $P(k)$ holds for every $k$, which is claim 2. [step 1.1, step 1.3, step 2.1, step 2.2, L3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Remarks

- Claim 2 is sharp: the identity map $n_k = k$ is strictly increasing with $n_k = k$ throughout, so no better bound than $n_k \ge k$ holds for all strictly increasing index maps.

- Claim 2 is exactly what makes a subsequence inherit a limit ([[lem-subsequence-inherits-limit]]): a threshold $K$ that works for the original sequence works unchanged for the subsequence, because $n_k \ge k \ge K$ whenever $k \ge K$.

- Nothing here is about $\mathbb{R}$; both claims are about $(\mathbb{N}, \le, \sigma)$ alone. Both are proved **by induction** ([L3]), and that is the method, not an order property. Claim 2 needs three order facts on top of the induction: that $0$ is least, which is what makes its base case $n_0 \ge 0$ true ([L1], step 1.3); discreteness ([[lem-nat-discrete]], [L2]), which upgrades $k < n_{\sigma(k)}$ to $\sigma(k) \le n_{\sigma(k)}$ (step 2.2); and transitivity in its mixed form, which composes $k \le n_k$ with $n_k < n_{\sigma(k)}$ into $k < n_{\sigma(k)}$ ([L4], step 2.2). Claim 1 additionally uses trichotomy and antisymmetry ([L4]).

- Of those three, neither the least element nor discreteness may be dropped. Discreteness alone is not enough: $(\mathbb{Z}, \le)$ is discrete in the same sense, $m < p$ iff $m + 1 \le p$, yet $k \mapsto k - 1$ is strictly increasing on $\mathbb{Z}$ with $n_k < k$ everywhere. What $\mathbb{Z}$ lacks is a least element to anchor the induction. A least element alone is not enough either, which is what fails over $\mathbb{Q}$: on the nonnegative rationals $x \mapsto x/2$ is strictly increasing and fixes the least element $0$, but $x/2 < x$ at every positive rational.

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]) and let $x, y \in
\mathbb{R}$. If $(x_k)$ converges to $x$ and $(x_k)$ converges to $y$
([[def-real-limit]]), then $x = y$. A sequence therefore has at most one limit,
and when a limit exists it may be denoted $\lim_{k} x_k$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals and reals $x, y$ such that $(x_k)$ converges to $x$ and $(x_k)$ converges to $y$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L1] Convergence: $(x_k)$ converges to $z$ when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_k - z| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$ ([[def-real-limit]]).

[L2] Triangle inequality: $|a + b| \le |a| + |b|$ in any ordered field, in particular in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Absolute value: $|u| \ge 0$, and $|u| = 0$ if and only if $u = 0$, and $|-u| = |u|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L4] Small rationals: for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$. Either route gives this: density of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) applied to the pair $0 < \eta$; or the Archimedean property ([[thm-of-archimedean]]) applied to $1/\eta$, which yields a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/\eta < n$ and hence $0 < 1/n < \eta$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

[L5] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$. Trichotomy, so $u \ne 0$ together with $|u| \ge 0$ and $|u| \ne 0$ forces $|u| > 0$; transitivity and irreflexivity of $<$; and, since $u \le v$ means $u < v$ or $u = v$, the mixed form $u \le v < w \Rightarrow u < w$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]). Adding two strict inequalities: $a < b$ and $c < d$ give $a + c < b + d$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]). Multiplying by a positive: for $c > 0$, $a < b$ gives $ac < bc$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]). Halving a positive: $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]), so $2 := 1 + 1 > 0$ because the positives are closed under addition ([[def-ordered-field]]), hence $2^{-1} > 0$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]) and $\eta/2 = \eta \cdot 2^{-1} > 0$ whenever $\eta > 0$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

[L6] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total, so any two indices $K_1, K_2$ admit an index $k$ with $k \ge K_1$ and $k \ge K_2$ ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $x \ne y$. [assume-contra]

2.1 Then $x - y \ne 0$, so $|x - y| \ne 0$ while $|x - y| \ge 0$; by trichotomy $|x - y| > 0$, and hence $|x - y|/2 > 0$. [step 1.1, L3, L5]

3.1 Choose a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < |x - y|/2$; multiplying that inequality by $2 > 0$ and using $(|x - y|/2) \cdot 2 = |x - y|$ gives $2\varepsilon < |x - y|$. [step 2.1, L4, L5, algebra, choose]

4.1 Since $(x_k)$ converges to $x$ there is $K_1$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K_1$, and since $(x_k)$ converges to $y$ there is $K_2$ with $|x_k - y| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K_2$. [step 3.1, L1]

5.1 Fix an index $k$ with $k \ge K_1$ and $k \ge K_2$; then $|x - y| = |(x - x_k) + (x_k - y)| \le |x - x_k| + |x_k - y| = |x_k - x| + |x_k - y|$, while adding the two strict inequalities of step 4.1 gives $|x_k - x| + |x_k - y| < \varepsilon + \varepsilon = 2\varepsilon$; composing the non-strict inequality with the strict one yields $|x - y| < 2\varepsilon$. [step 4.1, L2, L3, L5, L6]

6.1 Combining, $2\varepsilon < |x - y| < 2\varepsilon$, so $2\varepsilon < 2\varepsilon$, which contradicts irreflexivity of the strict order. [step 3.1, step 5.1, L5]

7.1 The assumption $x \ne y$ is therefore untenable, so $x = y$: a sequence of reals has at most one limit. [step 6.1, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- Uniqueness is what licenses the notation $\lim_{k} x_k$ and the phrase *the* limit. Without it the symbol would not denote. This library writes $\lim_k x_k$ only for sequences already known to converge, exactly as it writes $\sup S$ only for sets already known to have a supremum ([[rem-sup-conventions]]).

- The proof uses only that $\mathbb{R}$ is an ordered field in which arbitrarily small positive rationals exist, that is, an Archimedean ordered field ([[thm-of-archimedean]]). Completeness is not needed: limits are unique in $\mathbb{Q}$ too, where many sequences fail to have one.

- The hypothesis is genuinely about a single sequence having two limits. Two *different* sequences may of course share a limit, and a sequence with no limit at all is not excluded by anything here.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$, with
$|x|$ the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]). Then

$$|x| \ge 0; \quad |x| = 0 \iff x = 0; \quad -|x| \le x \le |x|; \quad |-x| = |x|; \quad |xy| = |x|\,|y|;$$

and, for every $c > 0$, one has $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and elements $x, y \in F$.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| = u$ if $u \ge 0$, and $|u| = -u$ if $u < 0$ ([[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Ordered-field order: trichotomy holds (for each $u$ exactly one of $u > 0$, $u = 0$, $u < 0$), $a < b$ means $b - a$ is positive, and sums and products of positives are positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Signs in products: $(-a)b = -(ab)$ and $(-a)(-b) = ab$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] Sign rules: a product of two elements of the same sign is positive, and a product of two elements of opposite sign is negative ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Case $x > 0$: by [L1] $|x| = x > 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; since $-x < 0$ we get $|-x| = -(-x) = x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -x < 0 < x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case pos, L1, L2, algebra]

1.2 Case $x = 0$: then $|x| = |0| = 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ holds with $|x| = 0$ and $x = 0$, while $|-x| = |0| = |x|$ and $-|x| = 0 \le 0 \le 0 = |x|$. [assume-case zero, L1]

1.3 Case $x < 0$: by [L1] $|x| = -x$, and [L2] gives $-x > 0$, so $|x| > 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; here $|-x| = -x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -(-x) = x \le x$ while $x < 0 < -x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case neg, L1, L2, algebra]

1.4 Case $x = 0$ or $y = 0$: then $xy = 0$, so $|xy| = 0$, and one of $|x|, |y|$ is $0$, whence $|x|\,|y| = 0 = |xy|$. [assume-case zerofactor, L1]

1.5 Case $x, y$ have the same sign (both positive or both negative): by [L4] $xy > 0$, so $|xy| = xy$, while $|x|\,|y| = xy$ by [L3] (for $x, y < 0$ this is $(-x)(-y) = xy$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case same, L1, L3, L4]

1.6 Case $x, y$ have opposite signs (one positive, one negative): by [L4] $xy < 0$, so $|xy| = -(xy)$, while $|x|\,|y| = -(xy)$ by [L3] (namely $x(-y)$ or $(-x)y$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case opposite, L1, L3, L4]

2.1 By trichotomy [L2] each $x$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.1-1.3, and in each we verified $|x| \ge 0$, that $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$, that $|-x| = |x|$, and that $-|x| \le x \le |x|$; hence all four hold for every $x$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, cases-exhaustive]

2.2 By trichotomy [L2] each pair $x, y$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.4-1.6, and in each $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$ for all $x, y$. [step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6, cases-exhaustive]

3.1 Let $c > 0$: if $|x| < c$ then $-c < -|x| \le x \le |x| < c$ by [step 2.1] and [L2], so $-c < x < c$; conversely if $-c < x < c$ then both $x < c$ and $-x < c$, and since $|x|$ equals $x$ or $-x$ by [L1], we get $|x| < c$, so $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$. [step 2.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field, with field structure as in [[def-field]], and for
$n \ge 1$ let $n \cdot 1_F$ denote the canonical natural number
$\underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$, defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$
and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$. Then for every $n \ge 1$:

- $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$;
- the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$;
- $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ and $(mn) \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F)$ for all $m, n \ge 1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ whose canonical naturals are defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, with $0 \cdot 1_F = 0$.

[L1] $0 < 1_F$ in every ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] The order is compatible with addition and positives are closed under addition: $a < b$ implies $a + c < b + c$, and $a > 0$, $b > 0$ imply $a + b > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 1$: by definition $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, and $1_F > 0$. [L1, base]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: assume $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for some fixed $n \ge 1$. [ih]

1.3 By the recursion, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F - n \cdot 1_F = 1_F > 0$, so $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$. [given, L1]

1.4 Additive identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ by the recursion, and if $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ then $(m+n+1) \cdot 1_F = (m+n) \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + (n+1) \cdot 1_F$. [given, algebra]

2.1 Inductive step: $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ is a sum of two positives, by the hypothesis and $1_F > 0$, hence $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Iterating 1.3, for $m < n$ one has $m \cdot 1_F < n \cdot 1_F$, so $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing and therefore injective on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$. [step 1.3, L2]

2.3 Multiplicative identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m \cdot 1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(1 \cdot 1_F)$, and the step $(m(n+1)) \cdot 1_F = (mn + m) \cdot 1_F = (mn) \cdot 1_F + m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F) + (m \cdot 1_F)(1_F) = (m \cdot 1_F)((n+1) \cdot 1_F)$ uses 1.4 and distributivity. [step 1.4, algebra]

3.1 By induction on 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for every $n \ge 1$; with the strict increase 2.2 and the identities 1.4, 2.3, every claim holds. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 1.4, step 2.3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}$, with closure as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]] and sequences and convergence as in
[[def-sequence]] and [[def-real-limit]]. Then

$$x \in \overline{A} \iff \text{there is a sequence } (a_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \text{ with } a_k \in A \text{ for every } k \text{ and } a_k \to x .$$

Consequently $A$ is closed if and only if it is **sequentially closed**: whenever
a sequence with all its terms in $A$ converges, its limit lies in $A$.

**The right-to-left direction is choice free; the left-to-right direction spends
$\mathrm{AC}_\omega$** ([[def-countable-choice]]). Producing a sequence from a
point of the closure requires selecting one point of $A$ from each of the
countably many sets $N_{1/(k+1)}(x) \cap A$, and this library has no canonical
rule for that selection, so the axiom of countable choice is invoked
explicitly at step 2.2 and nowhere else.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a real $x$. Sequences are functions on $\mathbb{N}$, which contains $0$, so a sequence is $(a_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ and the radii used below are $1/(k+1)$ rather than $1/k$ ([[def-sequence]]).

[L1] $\overline{A}$ is exactly the set of adherent points of $A$, that is, of points every neighbourhood of which meets $A$; and $A$ is closed exactly when $A = \overline{A}$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L2] $N_\varepsilon(x) = \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}$ for real $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L3] $(a_k) \to x$ means: for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|a_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$ ([[def-real-limit]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L4] Strictly between any two reals lies a rational; in particular for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a rational $q$ with $0 < q < \varepsilon$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L5] Reciprocal Archimedean property: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]]).

[L6] Canonical naturals: $n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ and $m \le n$ in $\mathbb{N}$ gives $m \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} \le n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]); a positive element has a positive inverse and $0 < a \le b$ gives $0 < 1/b \le 1/a$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

[L7] Countable choice: for every family $(X_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of nonempty sets there is a function $f$ with domain $\mathbb{N}$ such that $f(k) \in X_k$ for every $k$ ([[def-countable-choice]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For the right-to-left implication, assume $a_k \in A$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and $a_k \to x$, and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real. [assume-hyp, L3]

1.2 For the left-to-right implication, assume $x \in \overline{A}$; then for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ the radius $1/(k+1)$ is a positive real and the set $X_k := N_{1/(k+1)}(x) \cap A$ is nonempty, because $x$ is an adherent point of $A$ by [L1]. [assume-hyp, L1, L2, L6]

2.1 Fix a rational $q$ with $0 < q < \varepsilon$ by [L4], and then $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|a_k - x| < q$ for all $k \ge K$ by [L3]; in particular $|a_K - x| < q < \varepsilon$, so $a_K \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ and that intersection is nonempty. As $\varepsilon$ was an arbitrary positive real, $x$ is an adherent point of $A$, hence $x \in \overline{A}$ by [L1]. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L3, L4, choose]

2.2 Apply [L7] to the family $(X_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of step 1.2 and fix $f$ with $f(k) \in X_k$ for every $k$; putting $a_k := f(k)$ gives a sequence with $a_k \in A$ and $|a_k - x| < 1/(k+1)$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 1.2, L2, L7, choose]

3.1 That sequence converges to $x$: let $\varepsilon > 0$ be rational, fix by [L5] a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$, and put $K := n - 1$, a natural number since $n \ge 1$; for every $k \ge K$ one has $k + 1 \ge n \ge 1$, hence $0 < 1/(k+1) \le 1/n < \varepsilon$ by [L6], and therefore $|a_k - x| < 1/(k+1) < \varepsilon$. [step 2.2, L3, L5, L6, choose]

4.1 Step 2.1 gives the implication from right to left and steps 2.2 and 3.1 give it from left to right, so $x \in \overline{A}$ holds exactly when some sequence with all terms in $A$ converges to $x$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1]

4.2 Sequential closedness: if $A$ is closed and a sequence with all terms in $A$ converges to some $y$, then $y \in \overline{A}$ by step 2.1 and $\overline{A} = A$ by [L1], so $y \in A$; conversely, if every convergent sequence with terms in $A$ has its limit in $A$, then any $y \in \overline{A}$ is the limit of the sequence produced by steps 2.2 and 3.1, hence lies in $A$, so $\overline{A} \subseteq A$, and with $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ this gives $A = \overline{A}$, that is, $A$ is closed. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, L1]

5.1 Both assertions of the statement are proved, namely the sequential description of the closure in step 4.1 and the equivalence of closedness with sequential closedness in step 4.2. [step 4.1, step 4.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the choice is spent, and why it cannot be avoided here.** Step 2.2 is
  the only appeal to [[def-countable-choice]]. A canonical selection would
  require a rule picking a distinguished element of an arbitrary nonempty subset
  of $\mathbb{R}$, and $\mathbb{R}$ carries no well-ordering that this library
  has constructed, so this library has no such rule to offer. Contrast
  [[lem-subset-of-countable]] and [[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]], where
  the selection is from subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ and the least element is
  canonical.

- **The choice is genuinely confined to one direction.** Step 2.1 selects a
  single rational $q$ and a single index $K$ for one $\varepsilon$ at a time, and
  finitely many selections need no choice principle. So "the limit of a
  convergent sequence in a closed set lies in the set" is a theorem of ZF, and
  only the production of a sequence out of a point of the closure is not.

- **The indices start at $0$.** Since $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
  ([[def-sequence]]), the shrinking radii are $1/(k+1)$ and not $1/k$; the
  latter is undefined at $k = 0$. The threshold in step 3.1 is $K = n - 1$ for
  the same reason, and $n \ge 1$ is exactly what makes $K$ a natural number.

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals converging to $x \in \mathbb{R}$
([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]), and let $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$
be strictly increasing. Then the subsequence $(x_{n_k})$ converges to $x$.

**Divergence test.** Consequently, if two subsequences of $(x_k)$ converge to
different limits, then $(x_k)$ does not converge.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals converging to a real $x$, and a strictly increasing $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$, so that $(x_{n_k})$ is a subsequence of $(x_k)$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L1] $(x_k)$ converges to $x$ when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_k - x| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$ ([[def-real-limit]]).

[L2] Growth of the index map: $n_k \ge k$ for every $k$ ([[lem-index-map-grows]]).

[L3] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is transitive, so $n_k \ge k \ge K$ gives $n_k \ge K$ ([[thm-nat-linear-order]], [[def-nat-order]]).

[L4] A sequence has at most one limit ([[lem-limit-unique]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be rational. By convergence of $(x_k)$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_j - x| < \varepsilon$ for every $j \ge K$. [L1]

2.1 For every $k \ge K$ we have $n_k \ge k \ge K$, so the estimate of step 1.1 applies at the index $j = n_k$ and gives $|x_{n_k} - x| < \varepsilon$. [step 1.1, L2, L3]

3.1 Since the rational $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary, and the same threshold $K$ served, $(x_{n_k})$ converges to $x$. [step 2.1, L1]

4.1 Divergence test: suppose subsequences $(x_{n_k})$ and $(x_{m_k})$ converge to $a$ and $b$ with $a \ne b$. If $(x_k)$ converged, to $x$ say, then by step 3.1 both subsequences would converge to $x$, and uniqueness of limits would force $a = x$ and $b = x$, hence $a = b$, contrary to hypothesis; so $(x_k)$ does not converge. [step 3.1, L4] ∎

## Remarks

- A sequence is a subsequence of itself, via the identity index map $n_k = k$, which is strictly increasing. So "every subsequence converges to $x$" and "the sequence converges to $x$" are equivalent, and the lemma is the non-trivial half of that equivalence.

- The converse of the first claim is false: **one** convergent subsequence says nothing about the sequence ([[fs-subsequence-convergence-implies-convergence]]). It is the divergence test, not the convergence of a single subsequence, that is usable.

- The divergence test is the standard way to show a concrete sequence diverges, and it is how [[fs-bounded-implies-convergent]] is refuted. The opposite direction, extracting a convergent subsequence from a bounded sequence, is Bolzano-Weierstrass; it is **not available at this point in the reading order**, being the subject of the next page of this track, *Monotone Sequences, Bolzano-Weierstrass, and Cauchy Completeness*, where it is proved.

This page builds the topology of $\mathbb{R}$ out of the order and the absolute
value alone: a neighbourhood is an interval ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), and open
and closed are defined from neighbourhoods ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]). Some
of what follows uses nothing else about $\mathbb{R}$, and some of it is written
in order vocabulary from beginning to end. This remark separates the two, so a
reader knows which results are candidates for reuse elsewhere and which are not
even statable elsewhere. **It asserts nothing about topological spaces in
general: they are developed later in this library, on the page of
[[def-topological-space]] and [[def-metrizable-space]], where the metric
development becomes a special case, but no claim about them is made or needed
here and nothing below rests on them.**

**Results that use only the definitions.** [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]] and
[[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] use openness, closedness, closure and the
nesting property of neighbourhoods, together with the comparison of two positive
radii, and nothing beyond that. Neither the least-upper-bound property nor the
Archimedean property appears in either proof, and their statements mention no
interval, no bound and no order, so those statements would still make sense
wherever a notion of neighbourhood is available, however it arises.

**Results that cannot be separated from the order of $\mathbb{R}$.** Four
results on this page depend on the order. For the first three the order is in
what they say and not merely in how they are proved; for the fourth it is in the
proof only, and the bullet says so.

- [[thm-open-subsets-of-r-structure]] says that an open set is a countable
  disjoint union of **open intervals**. An interval is defined by the order
  ([[def-interval]]), the components are the classes of an equivalence relation
  defined by order-convexity, and the identification of a component as an
  interval is carried out with $\sup$ and $\inf$. Delete the order and there is
  no statement left to prove.
- [[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]] characterises connectedness by
  **order-convexity**. Connectedness itself is defined without the order
  ([[def-connected-r]]), but the property it is being equated with is an order
  property, so the theorem is a bridge between an order notion and a topological
  one and exists only where both are present.
- [[thm-heine-borel-r]] and [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]] speak of
  **closed bounded intervals** and of **bounded** sets. Boundedness is an order
  notion ([[def-bounded-set]]), and the proof of the first is a bisection, which
  uses the midpoint and hence the field operations as well. The completeness of
  $\mathbb{R}$ enters through [[thm-nested-interval-property]].
- [[thm-compact-iff-sequentially-compact-r]] routes **both** implications
  through the previous item, whose backward half spends the least-upper-bound
  property, and its **forward** implication additionally uses
  [[thm-bolzano-weierstrass]], which spends that property again; the backward
  implication does not use Bolzano-Weierstrass at all. Its statement mentions
  only compactness and sequences ([[def-open-cover-r]]), so unlike the three
  above it *is* statable without an order; the dependence lies entirely in the
  proof. This library provides no other proof, so nothing here licenses the
  equivalence outside $\mathbb{R}$.

**Where the dependence on completeness is visible rather than merely present.**
[[fs-closed-bounded-compact-without-completeness]] refutes, inside this library,
the claim that closed and bounded implies compact in an arbitrary ordered field,
and [[cex-closed-bounded-in-q-not-compact]] names the witness in $\mathbb{Q}$.
That is the sharpest statement this page makes about the limits of its own
results: the Heine-Borel characterisation is not a formal consequence of the
definitions, and it fails in the nearest ordered field that is not complete.

**The metric topology of $\mathbb{R}$ is the topology of this page.** This
library does develop metric spaces ([[def-metric-space]],
[[def-metric-topology]]), and $\mathbb{R}$ under $d(x,y) = |x-y|$ is one of them
([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]). The two resulting notions of *open subset
of $\mathbb{R}$* are not merely equivalent but literally the same condition, and
unfolding the definitions is the whole of the proof: claim 2 of that lemma gives
$B(x,r) = (x-r,\ x+r)$, which is exactly the neighbourhood $N_r(x)$ of
[[def-neighbourhood-r]], so "every point of $U$ admits a ball inside $U$" and
"every point of $U$ admits a neighbourhood inside $U$"
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) say the same thing word for word. This page still
proves everything from the order directly, so that nothing here rests on the
metric development; the identification is recorded so that a reader moving
between the two pages knows they are looking at one topology and not two.
Because the two collections of open sets are one collection, everything built
from them is one notion as well. The interior, closure and boundary of
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]] and of
[[def-metric-interior-closure-boundary]] are the same three sets, since each
side characterises them in both of the same two ways, pointwise by
neighbourhoods and by extremality among the open subsets and the closed
supersets ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]],
[[thm-metric-closure-characterisation]]); limit point, isolated point, adherent
point and dense are defined by literally the same condition on the two sides
([[def-limit-point-r]]), once $N_\varepsilon(x)$ and $B(x,\varepsilon)$ are
recognised as the same set; and
[[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]] is the case $X = \mathbb{R}$ of
[[thm-metric-sequential-closure]], spending the axiom of countable choice in the
same one of the two directions.

**Bounded means the same here as it does in the metric development, and that
agreement is not a topological fact.** [[def-bounded-set]] calls
$A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ bounded when it has both a lower and an upper bound,
while [[def-metric-bounded-diameter]] calls it bounded when it is empty or lies
inside some ball of $(\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$. The two conditions hold of
exactly the same subsets of $\mathbb{R}$. If $A \subseteq B(x_0,r) = (x_0 - r,\
x_0 + r)$ ([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]], claim 2, [[def-metric-ball]])
then $x_0 - r$ and $x_0 + r$ bound $A$ below and above; conversely, if
$\ell \le a \le u$ for every $a \in A$ and $A \ne \varnothing$, then $\ell \le u$
and $A \subseteq B(\ell,\ u - \ell + 1)$, the radius being at least $1$ and hence
positive; and an empty $A$ is bounded under both definitions, vacuously under the
first and by the explicit empty clause of the second. So the word **bounded** in
[[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]] may be read in either sense without
changing which sets the theorem names.

What may not be done is to read that theorem as a statement about the topology.
Boundedness is a property of the metric and not of the topology it induces
([[fs-boundedness-is-a-topological-property]]): the metric
$\rho(u,v) = \min\{|u-v|,\ 1\}$ induces exactly the open sets of this page, and
under it every subset of $\mathbb{R}$, including $\mathbb{R}$ itself, is
bounded. Since the open sets are unchanged, compactness ([[def-open-cover-r]])
is unchanged too, and $\mathbb{R}$ is not compact, being unbounded in the order
sense ([[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]]); yet $\mathbb{R}$ is closed,
and $\rho$-bounded. So "closed and bounded implies compact" is false for $\rho$
and true for $d_{\mathbb{R}}$, on one and the same topology. The identification
in the previous paragraph is with the usual metric specifically, and Heine-Borel
is a theorem about that metric and the order it comes from, not about the
topology alone.

**What is deliberately not claimed.** Whether the results above have analogues in
a setting carrying a topology with no order available at all, and whether
compactness and sequential compactness agree there, are questions about general
topological spaces. This library takes those questions up on a later page, where
[[def-metrizable-space]] identifies the metric development, this page's topology
included, as a special case of the general one; but nothing on **this** page
proves anything about general spaces, and the reader should take no assertion
about them from here. What is claimed here is narrower and
is checkable line by line against the proofs: in the four results listed above,
the order of $\mathbb{R}$ is used, and in three of them it is used in the
statement itself.

## Statement

Every bounded sequence of reals has a convergent subsequence: if $(x_k)$ is a
sequence of reals and there is $M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for every
$k \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-sequence]]), then there is a strictly increasing
$n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ and a real $L$ with $x_{n_j} \to L$.

Equivalently: the subsequential limit set of a bounded sequence is nonempty
([[def-subsequential-limit]]).

The theorem is the exact repair of the false claim that a bounded sequence
converges. A bounded
sequence need not converge, and the alternating sequence is the standing witness;
what boundedness does force is that *some* subsequence converges. The converse of
the theorem is false, and badly so: a sequence with a convergent subsequence need
not be bounded.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals and a real $M$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

[L1] Every sequence of reals has a monotone subsequence ([[lem-peak-monotone-subsequence]]).

[L2] A monotone sequence of reals converges if and only if it is bounded ([[cor-monotone-converges-iff-bounded]]).

[L3] A subsequence $(x_{n_j})$ of $(x_k)$ along a strictly increasing $n$ is again a sequence of reals, and each of its terms is a term of $(x_k)$; a sequence is bounded when some $M$ satisfies $|{\cdot}| \le M$ at every index ([[def-sequence]]).

[L4] Monotone means nondecreasing or nonincreasing ([[def-monotone-sequence]]).

[L5] $L$ is a subsequential limit of $(x_k)$ when some subsequence of $(x_k)$ converges to $L$ ([[def-subsequential-limit]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L1] fix a strictly increasing $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that the subsequence $(x_{n_j})$ is monotone; no hypothesis on $(x_k)$ is needed for this step. [given, L1, L4, choose]

2.1 $(x_{n_j})$ is bounded: each of its terms is a term of $(x_k)$, so $|x_{n_j}| \le M$ for every $j$, with the same $M$. [step 1.1, given, L3]

3.1 Being monotone and bounded, $(x_{n_j})$ converges; write $L$ for its limit. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L2]

4.1 So $(x_k)$ has a convergent subsequence, and $L$ is a subsequential limit of $(x_k)$; in particular the subsequential limit set of a bounded sequence is nonempty. [step 3.1, L5] ∎

## Remarks

- **The proof is two citations, and that is the point of the page order.** All
  the work sits in [[lem-peak-monotone-subsequence]], which needs nothing about
  $\mathbb{R}$ beyond trichotomy, and in [[cor-monotone-converges-iff-bounded]],
  which is where the least-upper-bound property is actually spent. Splitting the
  argument this way isolates the use of completeness in a single place instead of
  burying it in a bisection.

- **Bisection is the other standard proof and is not used here.** Halving the
  interval $[-M, M]$ repeatedly and keeping a half containing infinitely many
  terms produces a nested sequence of intervals whose lengths tend to $0$, and
  [[thm-nested-interval-property]] then yields the limit. That route is
  available in this library, since the nested interval property is proved on this
  page, but it needs an extra argument to choose the terms and to see that the
  chosen indices increase, whereas the monotone-subsequence route needs neither.

- **The limit is not determined by the theorem.** A bounded sequence may have
  many subsequential limits, and the theorem asserts only that there is at least
  one. Which subsequential limits exist, and that there is a largest and a
  smallest, is the subject of the $\limsup$ page.

- **Boundedness is sufficient but not necessary.** The converse fails, by
  [[fs-convergent-subsequence-implies-bounded]] and its witness
  [[cex-unbounded-with-convergent-subsequence]]: a wildly unbounded sequence can
  still have a constant, hence convergent, subsequence.

## Statement

Let $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $K$ is compact ([[def-open-cover-r]]) if and
only if $K$ is closed ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) and bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]).

This is the Heine-Borel theorem in the form used everywhere below. The forward
implication is [[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]] and spends no
completeness, only the Archimedean property and the existence of maxima of
finite sets; the backward implication rests on
[[thm-heine-borel-r]] and therefore on the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$, and the
remarks below record where it fails without completeness.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] Open cover, finite subfamily and compactness; the empty subfamily covers $\varnothing$ ([[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L2] A compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is closed and bounded ([[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]]).

[L3] Every closed bounded interval $[\ell,u]$ with $\ell \le u$ is compact ([[thm-heine-borel-r]]).

[L4] $K$ is closed exactly when $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L5] $K$ is bounded exactly when there are $\ell, u \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\ell \le y \le u$ for every $y \in K$ ([[def-bounded-set]]).

[L6] $[\ell,u] = \{\, z \in \mathbb{R} : \ell \le z \le u \,\}$ ([[def-interval]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 If $K$ is compact then $K$ is closed and bounded, which is [L2]; this is the forward implication. [L2]

1.2 For the backward implication assume $K$ is closed and bounded. If $K = \varnothing$ then every open cover of $K$ admits the empty subfamily as a finite subcover, so $K$ is compact. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.3 Assume moreover $K \ne \varnothing$; fix $s \in K$ and, by [L5], reals $\ell, u$ with $\ell \le y \le u$ for every $y \in K$. Then $\ell \le s \le u$, so $\ell \le u$, and $K \subseteq [\ell,u]$ by [L6]. [assume-hyp, L5, L6, choose]

2.1 Let $\mathcal{U}$ be an open cover of $K$ and put $\mathcal{W} := \mathcal{U} \cup \{\mathbb{R} \setminus K\}$. Every member of $\mathcal{W}$ is open, since $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$ is open by [L4], and $\mathcal{W}$ covers $[\ell,u]$: a point of $[\ell,u]$ either lies in $K$, hence in some member of $\mathcal{U}$, or lies outside $K$, hence in $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$. [step 1.3, L1, L4]

3.1 By [L3] the interval $[\ell,u]$ is compact, so some finite subfamily $\{W_0, \dots, W_p\}$ of $\mathcal{W}$ covers $[\ell,u]$, where the case of an empty subfamily is possible only when $[\ell,u] = \varnothing$, which is excluded by $\ell \le u$. Put $\mathcal{V} := \{\, W_i : W_i \in \mathcal{U} \,\}$, a finite subfamily of $\mathcal{U}$. Then $K \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{V}$: a point $y \in K \subseteq [\ell,u]$ lies in some $W_i$, and $W_i$ cannot be a member of $\mathcal{W}$ outside $\mathcal{U}$, because the only such member is $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$ and $y \in K$; so $W_i \in \mathcal{U}$ and $W_i \in \mathcal{V}$. [step 2.1, L1, L3, L6]

4.1 Every open cover of a nonempty closed bounded $K$ therefore has a finite subcover, so such a $K$ is compact; together with the empty case of step 1.2 this proves the backward implication, and step 1.1 is the forward one. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 3.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **A closed subset of a compact set is compact.** If $C \subseteq K$ with $K$
  compact and $C$ closed, then $C$ is bounded, being a subset of a bounded set,
  and closed by hypothesis, so it is compact by the theorem. The corresponding
  statement for arbitrary subsets is false: $(0,1) \subseteq [0,1]$ is bounded
  and not compact ([[cex-unbounded-closed-set-not-compact]]).

- **Both hypotheses are needed and neither implies the other.**
  [[cex-unbounded-closed-set-not-compact]] exhibits a closed set that is not
  bounded and a bounded set that is not closed, and neither is compact.

- **What the theorem is not.** It characterises compactness *for subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$*. The two halves are of very different strengths: the forward
  half is elementary and general, while the backward half rests on the
  completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ and fails over $\mathbb{Q}$
  ([[fs-closed-bounded-compact-without-completeness]], witnessed by
  [[cex-closed-bounded-in-q-not-compact]]). Nothing here licenses "closed and
  bounded implies compact" in any other setting.

## Statement

Every complete ordered field $F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) is Archimedean:
for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$,
where $n \cdot 1_F$ is the canonical natural of the ordered field $F$
([[def-ordered-field]]). Equivalently, the canonical naturals are cofinal in $F$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $F$; write $A = \{\, n \cdot 1_F : n \ge 1 \,\}$ for the set of its canonical naturals.

[L1] Least-upper-bound property: every nonempty $S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound $\sup S \in F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Each canonical natural satisfies $n \cdot 1_F > 0$, one has $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L3] $0 < 1_F$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $F$ is not Archimedean: there is some $x \in F$ with $n \cdot 1_F \le x$ for all $n \ge 1$, that is, $x$ is an upper bound of $A$. [assume-contra]

2.1 The set $A$ is nonempty, since $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F \in A$, and it is bounded above by $x$. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 By the least-upper-bound property, $A$ has a least upper bound $s = \sup A \in F$. [step 2.1, L1]

4.1 Since $1_F > 0$, we have $s - 1_F < s$; as $s$ is the least upper bound, $s - 1_F$ is not an upper bound of $A$. [step 3.1, L3]

5.1 Hence there is some $m \ge 1$ with $m \cdot 1_F > s - 1_F$. [step 4.1]

6.1 Adding $1_F$ to both sides, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F > s$. [step 5.1, L2]

7.1 But $(m+1) \cdot 1_F \in A$, so $(m+1) \cdot 1_F \le s$ because $s$ is an upper bound of $A$, contradicting 6.1. [step 6.1, step 3.1, L2]

8.1 The assumption is therefore untenable, so $F$ is Archimedean. [step 7.1, discharge-contradiction] ∎
