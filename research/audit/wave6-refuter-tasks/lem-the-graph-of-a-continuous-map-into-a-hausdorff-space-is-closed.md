## Statement

Let $X$ be a topological space, let $Y$ be Hausdorff
([[def-hausdorff-space]]) and let $f : X \to Y$ be continuous
([[def-continuous-map-top]]). Then the **graph**

$$G_f \;:=\; \{\, z \in X \times Y : z_1 = f(z_0) \,\} \;=\; \{\, (x, f(x)) : x \in X \,\}$$

is closed in $X \times Y$ with the product topology ([[def-product-topology]]).

No hypothesis is placed on $X$. The Hausdorff hypothesis is on the codomain and
the continuity hypothesis is on $f$; both are used, and the converse implication
— that a closed graph forces continuity — needs a *different* hypothesis on the
codomain and is treated separately.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A topological space $X$, a Hausdorff space $Y$, a continuous map $f : X \to Y$, and the product $X \times Y$ with the product topology and projections $\pi_0, \pi_1$.

[A1] $G_f = \{\, z \in X \times Y : (f \circ \pi_0)(z) = \pi_1(z) \,\}$, since $(f \circ \pi_0)(z) = f(z_0)$ and $\pi_1(z) = z_1$ ([[def-product-topology]], [[def-the-diagonal-of-a-space]]).

[L1] The projections $\pi_0 : X \times Y \to X$ and $\pi_1 : X \times Y \to Y$ are continuous ([[thm-product-universal-property]], claim 1).

[L2] A composite of continuous maps is continuous ([[lem-continuity-is-local-and-pastes]], claim 1).

[L3] If $Y$ is Hausdorff and $u, v : Z \to Y$ are continuous, then $\{\, z \in Z : u(z) = v(z) \,\}$ is closed in $Z$ ([[cor-the-agreement-set-of-two-maps-into-a-hausdorff-space-is-closed]], [[def-hausdorff-space]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $\pi_0$ and $\pi_1$ are continuous. [L1]

2.1 $f \circ \pi_0 : X \times Y \to Y$ is continuous, being a composite of the continuous $\pi_0$ with the continuous $f$. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 By [A1] the graph $G_f$ is the agreement set of the two continuous maps $f \circ \pi_0$ and $\pi_1$ from $X \times Y$ to the Hausdorff space $Y$, so it is closed in $X \times Y$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, A1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **The graph is an agreement set, and that is the whole proof.** Writing $G_f$ as the set where $f \circ \pi_0$ and $\pi_1$ agree turns a statement about a map into a statement about two maps out of one space, which is exactly the shape [[cor-the-agreement-set-of-two-maps-into-a-hausdorff-space-is-closed]] handles. Equivalently $G_f = \langle f \circ \pi_0, \pi_1 \rangle^{-1}[\Delta_Y]$, the preimage of the diagonal ([[def-the-diagonal-of-a-space]]).

- **The Hausdorff hypothesis is not removable.** Let $X$ be a one-point space and let $Y = \{a,b\}$ with $a \ne b$ carry the indiscrete topology ([[def-standard-topologies]]). Every function $X \to Y$ is continuous, the only preimages to check being those of $\varnothing$ and $Y$. The product $X \times Y$ has as its open boxes only $\varnothing$ and itself, so its only closed sets are $\varnothing$ and itself; and $G_f$ is a single point, hence neither. The argument above breaks at [L3] and nowhere else.

- **Continuity of $f$ is used, and only through the composite.** Step 2.1 is the only appearance of the hypothesis; everything else is a property of the product.

## Statement

Let $Z$ be a topological space, let $Y$ be a Hausdorff space
([[def-hausdorff-space]]) and let $f, g : Z \to Y$ be continuous
([[def-continuous-map-top]]). Then the **agreement set**

$$E(f,g) \;:=\; \{\, z \in Z : f(z) = g(z) \,\}$$

is closed in $Z$.

No hypothesis is placed on $Z$: the separation hypothesis is on the **codomain**
alone, and it is not decoration. Let $Y_0 = \{a,b\}$ with $a \ne b$ carry the
indiscrete topology ([[def-standard-topologies]]), which is not Hausdorff. Every
function $Z \to Y_0$ is continuous, the only preimages to check being those of
$\varnothing$ and $Y_0$, namely $\varnothing$ and $Z$. So for **any** subset
$S \subseteq Z$ the constant map $f_0 \equiv a$ and the map $g_0$ taking the
value $a$ on $S$ and $b$ off $S$ are continuous with $E(f_0,g_0) = S$, closed or
not.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Topological spaces $Z$ and $Y$ with $Y$ Hausdorff, continuous maps $f, g : Z \to Y$, and the product $Y \times Y$ with the product topology.

[A1] $E(f,g) = \langle f, g \rangle^{-1}[\Delta_Y]$, where $\langle f, g \rangle : Z \to Y \times Y$ is the pairing and $\Delta_Y$ the diagonal ([[def-the-diagonal-of-a-space]]).

[L1] The pairing $\langle f, g \rangle$ is continuous whenever $f$ and $g$ are ([[lem-the-diagonal-map-is-an-embedding]], claim 1).

[L2] $\Delta_Y$ is closed in $Y \times Y$, since $Y$ is Hausdorff ([[thm-hausdorff-iff-the-diagonal-is-closed]], [[def-hausdorff-space]]).

[L3] A map is continuous if and only if the preimage of every closed set is closed ([[thm-continuity-characterisations-top]], clauses (a) and (c), [[def-continuous-map-top]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $\langle f, g \rangle : Z \to Y \times Y$ is continuous. [L1]

1.2 $\Delta_Y$ is closed in $Y \times Y$. [L2]

2.1 $E(f,g) = \langle f, g \rangle^{-1}[\Delta_Y]$ is the preimage of a closed set under a continuous map, hence closed in $Z$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, A1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the diagonal criterion is the right tool here.** The condition "$f(z) = g(z)$" is a condition on the *pair* of values, so it becomes a membership condition once the two maps are packaged into one map into the square; the criterion then converts the separation hypothesis on $Y$ into the closedness of the set that condition names. Nothing is proved twice: the whole content is [[thm-hausdorff-iff-the-diagonal-is-closed]] together with the preimage identity of [[def-the-diagonal-of-a-space]].

- **Both hypotheses are used, and only these.** Continuity of $f$ and $g$ enters only through [L1], and the Hausdorff condition only through [L2]. In particular no countability, compactness or separation hypothesis on $Z$ appears anywhere in the argument.

- **The complement is what the statement is often used for.** $Z \setminus E(f,g)$ is open, so if $f$ and $g$ differ at a point they differ throughout some open neighbourhood of it. Equivalently, $E(f,g)$ contains the closure of every subset of $Z$ on which $f$ and $g$ agree, which is the form in which a statement about a dense set is obtained from this one.

## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be topological spaces
([[def-topological-space]]), let $f : X \to Y$ be a function and let $x \in X$.
Neighbourhoods are as in [[def-neighbourhood-top]].

$f$ is **continuous at $x$** if for every neighbourhood $V$ of $f(x)$ in $Y$ the
preimage $f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ in $X$.

$f$ is **continuous** if it is continuous at every point of $X$.

**The same condition with open sets only.** $f$ is continuous at $x$ if and only
if for every open $V \subseteq Y$ with $f(x) \in V$ there is an open
$U \subseteq X$ with $x \in U$ and $f[U] \subseteq V$. Indeed, if $f$ is
continuous at $x$ and $V$ is such an open set, then $V$ is a neighbourhood of
$f(x)$, so $f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ and contains an open $U \ni x$,
which satisfies $f[U] \subseteq V$. Conversely, given the displayed condition and
a neighbourhood $V$ of $f(x)$, fix open $V_0$ with $f(x) \in V_0 \subseteq V$ and
then open $U \ni x$ with $f[U] \subseteq V_0$; then $x \in U \subseteq f^{-1}[V_0] \subseteq f^{-1}[V]$,
so $f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$. Both forms are used below and are the
same statement written twice.

**Preimage, not image.** $f^{-1}[V] = \{\, x \in X : f(x) \in V \,\}$
is the preimage in the sense of [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]] and is
defined for every function, invertible or not; no inverse function is being
asserted to exist. Continuity is a condition on preimages throughout, and the
corresponding conditions on images define the *open* and *closed* maps of a later
item, which are different notions.

## Remarks

- **This is the metric definition when both topologies are metric topologies.**
  For metric spaces, $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ continuity at $a$
  ([[def-metric-continuity]]) says that every ball around $f(a)$ has a ball
  around $a$ mapped into it, and the balls around a point are a neighbourhood
  base there; the identification is carried out where metrizable spaces are
  defined later on this page. Nothing about a metric survives in the definition
  above: continuity is a relation between two topologies and a function, and it
  is meaningless to ask whether a function between bare sets is continuous.

- **Continuity depends on both topologies, and coarsening the target or refining
  the source only helps.** If $f$ is continuous and $\mathcal{T}_X$ is replaced
  by a finer topology, or $\mathcal{T}_Y$ by a coarser one, $f$ remains
  continuous, since each condition to be verified is weakened and each
  neighbourhood available in the source is still available. In particular every
  map out of a discrete space and every map into an indiscrete space is
  continuous ([[def-standard-topologies]]).

- **Continuity at a point is strictly weaker than continuity.** A function may be
  continuous at exactly one point, and the definition above is deliberately local
  so that the sequential criteria proved later can be stated pointwise.

## Definition

A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ ([[def-topological-space]]) is
**Hausdorff** when any two distinct points are separated by disjoint open sets:
for all $x, y \in X$ with $x \ne y$ there are $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$ with

$$x \in U, \qquad y \in V, \qquad U \cap V = \varnothing .$$

Since an open set containing a point is an open neighbourhood of it
([[def-neighbourhood-top]]), the condition reads: distinct points have disjoint
open neighbourhoods. Nothing is asserted about points that are equal, and the
condition is vacuous for a space with at most one point, so every such space is
Hausdorff.

**Every metrizable space is Hausdorff.** This is not proved here, because it is
already discharged: [[def-metrizable-space]] records it among the two things
every metrizable space has, deriving it from
[[thm-metric-hausdorff-separation]], which separates $p \ne q$ in a metric space
by the disjoint open balls $B(p,r)$ and $B(q,r)$ with $r = d(p,q)/2 > 0$. In
particular $\mathbb{R}$ with its usual topology, every $\mathbb{R}^n$, and every
subspace of a metrizable space are Hausdorff.

**Not every space is Hausdorff.** The indiscrete topology
$\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{ind}} = \{\varnothing, X\}$ on a set $X = \{a,b\}$ with
$a \ne b$ ([[def-standard-topologies]]) is not: the only open set containing $a$
is $X$, the only one containing $b$ is $X$, and $X \cap X = X \ne \varnothing$.
This is the same two-point space that [[def-metrizable-space]] uses to exhibit a
topology induced by no metric, and the reason is the same one: failure of the
Hausdorff condition is an obstruction to metrizability.

**Being Hausdorff is a topological property** ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]).
If $h : X \to Z$ is a homeomorphism and $X$ is Hausdorff, then for $z \ne z'$ in
$Z$ the points $h^{-1}(z)$ and $h^{-1}(z')$ are distinct, so they have disjoint
open $U, V$; the images $h[U]$ and $h[V]$ are open, disjoint, and contain $z$ and
$z'$ respectively, a homeomorphism carrying the open sets of one space
bijectively onto those of the other. So no space homeomorphic to a Hausdorff
space fails the condition.

**Scope of this item.** Only the definition, the metrizable case and the
two-point failure are recorded here, because that is all this page uses. The
Hausdorff condition is one of a graded family of separation axioms; that family,
its ordering, and the questions of which of its members are hereditary or
preserved by products, are not available at this point in the reading order and
nothing here anticipates them. What this page does use is a single negative
result: a quotient of a Hausdorff space need not be Hausdorff, which is recorded
below as a false statement and witnessed on the companion page.

## Remarks

- **Hausdorff spaces have closed singletons.** Fix $x \in X$ and take the union
  of all open subsets of $X$ that avoid $x$. Every $y \ne x$ belongs to one of
  them, by Hausdorff separation of $x$ and $y$, while $x$ belongs to none. The
  union is therefore exactly $X \setminus \{x\}$, so $\{x\}$ is closed.
  Thus the Hausdorff property implies the singleton-closed ($T_1$) property.
  The converse fails: closed singletons need not give disjoint neighbourhoods
  of distinct points.

- **What the Hausdorff condition buys, in the one place this page needs it.**
  Separation of distinct points by disjoint open sets is exactly what a quotient
  map can destroy: identifying points of a Hausdorff space can leave two classes
  every pair of whose open neighbourhoods meet, and the companion page exhibits
  such a quotient of a metrizable space. Nothing weaker than an explicit witness
  settles that, since the condition is a statement about all pairs of open sets.

- **The name.** Hausdorff's own 1914 axiom system for a topological space
  included this condition, so "topological space" once meant what is now called a
  Hausdorff space; this library follows the modern convention in which
  [[def-topological-space]] assumes no separation at all and every separation
  hypothesis is stated where it is used.

## Definition

**The product set.** Let $I$ be a set and let $X_i$ be a set for each $i \in I$.
The **product** is

$$\prod_{i \in I} X_i \;:=\; \Big\{\, x : x \text{ is a function with domain } I \text{ and } x(i) \in X_i \text{ for every } i \in I \,\Big\},$$

and we write $x_i := x(i)$, the $i$-th **coordinate** of $x$. Two elements of the
product are equal exactly when they agree at every index, functions being equal
when they have the same domain and the same values. For $j \in I$ the $j$-th
**projection** is

$$\pi_j : \prod_{i \in I} X_i \to X_j, \qquad \pi_j(x) := x_j .$$

**Notation for a finite product.** For $I = n$ a natural number, which is the set
$\{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ of its predecessors, an element of $\prod_{k<n} X_k$ is a
function on $n$ and we write it $(x_0, \dots, x_{n-1})$. In particular $I = 2$
gives the **binary product**, written $X \times Y$ for $\prod_{i<2} X_i$ with
$X_0 = X$ and $X_1 = Y$, whose elements are written $(u,v)$ for the function
$0 \mapsto u$, $1 \mapsto v$. This is the only meaning the symbol $X \times Y$
carries on this page.

**Two facts about when the product is nonempty, stated because they are used and
because they cost something.** If some $X_{i_0}$ is empty then the product is
empty, since no function can take a value in $X_{i_0}$. Conversely, suppose every
$X_i$ is nonempty.

- For $I = n$ a natural number, the product is nonempty, and this is a theorem of
  ZF: [[lem-finite-choice]] applied to the function $i \mapsto X_i$ on $n$
  supplies a choice function $g$ for the family of values, and
  $x(i) := g(X_i)$ defines a member of $\prod_{k<n} X_k$.
- For an arbitrary $I$ the assertion "$\prod_{i \in I} X_i \ne \varnothing$
  whenever every $X_i$ is nonempty" **is** the Axiom of Choice: it is the
  formulation recorded in [[def-axiom-of-choice]], and the choice function of
  [[def-choice-function]] is exactly a point of the product of a family by
  itself. Every use of it below is flagged at the step that spends it.

**The box topology.** Now let each $X_i$ carry a topology $\mathcal{T}_i$
([[def-topological-space]]). Put

$$\mathcal{R} \;:=\; \Big\{\, \prod_{i \in I} U_i \;:\; U_i \in \mathcal{T}_i \text{ for every } i \in I \,\Big\},$$

the family of **boxes**. $\mathcal{R}$ is a basis for a topology
([[thm-basis-criterion]]): it contains $\prod_i X_i$, so it covers the product,
and it is closed under binary intersections, since

$$\Big(\prod_i U_i\Big) \cap \Big(\prod_i V_i\Big) = \prod_i (U_i \cap V_i)$$

and each $U_i \cap V_i$ is open by (T3). The topology it generates is the **box
topology** $\mathcal{T}^{\square}$, and $\mathcal{R}$ is a basis for it
([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]).

**The product topology.** The **product topology** $\mathcal{T}^{\Pi}$ on
$\prod_i X_i$ is the initial topology of the family of projections
$(\pi_i)_{i \in I}$ ([[def-initial-and-final-topology]]): the topology generated
by the subbasis

$$\mathcal{G} \;:=\; \{\, \pi_i^{-1}[U] : i \in I,\ U \in \mathcal{T}_i \,\}, \qquad \pi_i^{-1}[U] = \prod_{j \in I} W_j \ \text{ with } W_i = U \text{ and } W_j = X_j \text{ for } j \ne i .$$

By [[thm-basis-criterion]] the finite intersections of members of $\mathcal{G}$
form a basis for $\mathcal{T}^{\Pi}$, and those finite intersections are exactly
the boxes with all but finitely many factors unrestricted:

$$\mathcal{R}^{\Pi} \;=\; \Big\{\, \prod_{i \in I} U_i \;:\; U_i \in \mathcal{T}_i \text{ for every } i, \text{ and } U_i = X_i \text{ for all but finitely many } i \,\Big\}.$$

Indeed the intersection of $\pi_{i_1}^{-1}[U_1], \dots, \pi_{i_n}^{-1}[U_n]$ is
the box whose factor at $i$ is the intersection of those $U_m$ with $i_m = i$ and
is $X_i$ when no $i_m$ equals $i$; and the intersection of no members is the
whole product, the box with every factor $X_i$. Conversely a box with
$U_i = X_i$ off a finite set is such an intersection. Members of
$\mathcal{R}^{\Pi}$ are called **basic product-open** sets, and members of
$\mathcal{R}$ **boxes**. So $\mathcal{R}^{\Pi} \subseteq \mathcal{R}$, with
equality when $I$ is a natural number.

**The empty product.** For $I = \varnothing$ there is exactly one function with
domain $\varnothing$, the empty function, so $\prod_{i \in \varnothing} X_i$ is a
one-point set. A one-point set carries exactly one topology, namely
$\{\varnothing, \{\varnothing\}\}$, since a topology must contain the empty set
and the whole set and there is nothing else to contain
([[def-topological-space]]); so the box topology and the product topology agree
there, and both equal the discrete topology and the indiscrete topology
([[def-standard-topologies]]), which coincide on a one-point set. There are no
projections to speak of, and the initial topology of the empty family is indeed
the indiscrete one ([[def-initial-and-final-topology]]).

**Convention.** Unless the box topology is named explicitly, $\prod_i X_i$ always
carries the product topology in this library. That is not a matter of taste: the
product topology is the one with the characteristic property of the next item,
and the box topology has no such property.

## Remarks

- **Where the two topologies actually differ.** The box topology is finer than
  the product topology by construction, since $\mathcal{R}^{\Pi} \subseteq
  \mathcal{R}$. They agree whenever $I$ is finite; and, assuming the Axiom of Choice, for a
  family of **nonempty** spaces they differ for infinite $I$ as soon as infinitely
  many factors have a nonempty proper open subset. Nonemptiness is not decoration: if one factor is
  empty then the product is empty and carries exactly one topology, so the two
  agree however the other factors are chosen. Both statements are proved two items
  below, with that hypothesis, and the failure is recorded on this page as a false
  statement.

- **The product set is a set of functions, and that is not a technicality.** The
  factors are indexed by an arbitrary set, so there is no "list" to write down;
  writing $x = (x_i)_{i \in I}$ is notation for the function $x$. The finite case
  recovers the familiar tuple, and the identification of $\prod_{k<n}\mathbb{R}$
  with the $\mathbb{R}^n$ of [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] is literal, that item defining
  $\mathbb{R}^n$ as the set of functions $n \to \mathbb{R}$.

- **The projections carry no hypothesis.** They are defined for every product,
  including the empty one and products with an empty factor; what does need a
  hypothesis is their *surjectivity*, which is the point at which choice enters
  and which is stated separately in the next item.

## Definition

Throughout, a topology is as in [[def-topological-space]], and *finite*,
*at most countable* and *uncountable* are as in [[def-countable]], so that
"countable" always means "at most countable" and every finite set is countable.
Let $X$ be a set. The six families below are topologies on $X$; that each really
satisfies (T1), (T2) and (T3) is discharged in full after the list.

1. **Discrete topology.** $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{disc}} := \mathcal{P}(X)$: every
   subset is open, hence every subset is closed, hence every subset is clopen.
2. **Indiscrete topology.** $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{ind}} := \{\varnothing, X\}$.
   Its closed sets are again $\varnothing$ and $X$.
3. **Cofinite topology.**
   $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{cof}} := \{\varnothing\} \cup \{\, U \subseteq X : X \setminus U \text{ is finite} \,\}$.
   Its closed sets are $X$ together with the finite subsets of $X$.
4. **Cocountable topology.**
   $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{coc}} := \{\varnothing\} \cup \{\, U \subseteq X : X \setminus U \text{ is at most countable} \,\}$.
   Its closed sets are $X$ together with the at most countable subsets of $X$.
5. **Particular-point topology.** Fix $p \in X$ and put
   $\mathcal{T}_p := \{\varnothing\} \cup \{\, U \subseteq X : p \in U \,\}$: the
   open sets are $\varnothing$ and the sets containing $p$. Its closed sets are
   $X$ together with the sets **not** containing $p$.
6. **Sierpinski topology.** On a two-point set $S = \{a, b\}$ with $a \ne b$,
   $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{Sier}} := \{\varnothing, \{b\}, S\}$. The pair
   $(S, \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{Sier}})$ is **Sierpinski space**; $b$ is its open
   point and $a$ its closed point. This is exactly the particular-point topology
   of item 5 on a two-point set with particular point $b$, listed separately
   because it is quoted so often.

**Two elementary facts about finite sets are used below, and both are proved
here.**

*(i) A subset of a finite set is finite.* Let $F \approx n$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}$
([[def-equinumerous]], [[def-natural-numbers]]), witnessed by a bijection
$\varphi : F \to n$, and let $B \subseteq F$. Then $\varphi$ restricts to a
bijection of $B$ onto $\varphi[B] \subseteq n$
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]). Every element of the von Neumann natural
$n$ is a natural number strictly smaller than $n$
([[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]), so $\varphi[B]$ is a subset of $\mathbb{N}$
bounded above by $n$, hence finite by the sharper form of
[[lem-subset-of-countable]] ("a subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is finite if it is
bounded above"). Since $\approx$ is symmetric and transitive, $B$ is finite.

*(ii) A union of two finite sets is finite.* First, if $H$ is finite and $g$ is
any object then $H \cup \{g\}$ is finite: if $g \in H$ there is nothing to prove,
and otherwise a bijection $u : H \to k$ extends to a bijection
$H \cup \{g\} \to k \cup \{k\} = \sigma(k)$ by setting $u(g) := k$, which is
injective because $k \notin k$ ([[lem-nat-transitive-irreflexive]]). Now fix a
finite set $F$ and argue by induction ([[thm-induction-principle]]) on
$m \in \mathbb{N}$ over the statement "for every $G$ with $G \approx m$, the union
$F \cup G$ is finite". At $m = 0$ we have $G = \varnothing$ and $F \cup G = F$. At
$m = \sigma(j)$, a bijection $\psi : G \to \sigma(j)$ gives $g := \psi^{-1}(j)$
and $G' := G \setminus \{g\} \approx j$ (restrict $\psi$), so
$F \cup G = (F \cup G') \cup \{g\}$ is finite by the induction hypothesis and the
previous sentence.

**Discharge of the topology axioms.**

*Discrete.* Every subset of $X$ lies in $\mathcal{P}(X)$, so (T1), (T2) and (T3)
hold with nothing to check.

*Indiscrete.* (T1) is the definition. For (T2), a subfamily of
$\{\varnothing, X\}$ has union $\varnothing$ (if it is empty or $\{\varnothing\}$)
or $X$ (otherwise). For (T3), $\varnothing \cap A = \varnothing$ and
$X \cap X = X$.

*Cofinite.* (T1): $\varnothing$ is listed, and $X \setminus X = \varnothing$ is
finite. (T2): let $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{cof}}$. If every
member is $\varnothing$ the union is $\varnothing$. Otherwise fix
$U_0 \in \mathcal{S}$ with $U_0 \ne \varnothing$; then
$X \setminus \bigcup \mathcal{S} \subseteq X \setminus U_0$, which is finite, so
the left side is finite by (i). (T3): for nonempty $U, V$ with finite
complements, $X \setminus (U \cap V) = (X \setminus U) \cup (X \setminus V)$ is
finite by (ii); and if either of $U, V$ is empty so is $U \cap V$. The closed sets
are the complements of the open ones, that is $X = X \setminus \varnothing$
together with the finite sets.

*Cocountable.* Identical to the cofinite case with "at most countable" in place of
"finite": (i) is replaced by [[lem-subset-of-countable]] itself, and (ii) by the
statement that a union of two at most countable sets is at most countable, which
is the two-set instance of [[thm-countable-union-of-countable]] applied to the
family $A_0 := U, A_1 := V, A_k := \varnothing$ for $k \ge 2$.

*Particular point.* (T1): $\varnothing$ is listed and $p \in X$. (T2): a
subfamily whose members are all $\varnothing$ has union $\varnothing$; otherwise
some member contains $p$, hence so does the union. (T3): if $U$ and $V$ both
contain $p$ then so does $U \cap V$; and if either is $\varnothing$ then so is the
intersection.

*Sierpinski.* The special case $X = \{a,b\}$, $p = b$ of the previous paragraph:
the sets containing $b$ are $\{b\}$ and $S$, so
$\mathcal{T}_b = \{\varnothing, \{b\}, S\} = \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{Sier}}$.

## Remarks

- **Two degenerate collapses.** If $X$ is finite then the cofinite topology is
  the discrete one, since every subset then has finite complement by fact (i)
  above; if $X$ is at most countable the cocountable topology is discrete for the
  same reason. Both families are therefore interesting only on an infinite,
  respectively uncountable, set, and every statement made about them below names
  that hypothesis.

- **Where the two extremes sit in the comparison order.** The discrete topology
  is the finest and the indiscrete the coarsest topology on $X$
  ([[def-topological-space]]): every topology is a subfamily of $\mathcal{P}(X)$
  and contains $\varnothing$ and $X$. Every other topology on $X$ lies between
  them, and the cofinite topology is coarser than the cocountable one, because a
  finite set is at most countable.

- **No choice principle is needed for any of the six, despite the citation.**
  The only appeal above that carries a choice hypothesis is
  [[thm-countable-union-of-countable]], whose statement assumes
  $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$, and it is used for a union of **two** sets only, padded
  with copies of $\varnothing$. That instance is provable in ZF alone, by
  interleaving two *given* enumerations, exactly as
  [[cor-irrationals-uncountable]] records for the union of the rationals and the
  irrationals; the general theorem is cited because it is the form in which this
  library states the union result, not because the strength is needed. Nothing
  about the cocountable topology depends on countable choice.

- **The Sierpinski point that is open is a genuine choice of labelling.** Both
  $\{\varnothing,\{b\},S\}$ and $\{\varnothing,\{a\},S\}$ are topologies, and they
  are carried to each other by the transposition of $a$ and $b$; this library
  fixes the first and always names the open point.

## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be topological spaces
([[def-topological-space]]). Throughout, $X \times Y$ is the binary product
$\prod_{i<2} X_i$ with $X_0 = X$ and $X_1 = Y$ ([[def-product-topology]]),
carrying the product topology; a point of it is a **function** $z$ on the von
Neumann natural $2 = \{0,1\}$, written $(z_0, z_1)$, and $\pi_0, \pi_1$ are the
two projections.

**The basis used throughout.** For the index set $2$ the product basis and the
box basis coincide, since a box $\prod_{i<2} U_i$ has all but finitely many
factors unrestricted for the trivial reason that it has only two
([[def-product-topology]]). So

$$\{\, U \times V : U \in \mathcal{T},\ V \in \mathcal{T}_Y \,\}$$

is a basis for the product topology on $X \times Y$, and every statement below
that tests a basic open set tests a box of two open sets.

**The diagonal.** The **diagonal** of $X$ is

$$\Delta_X \;:=\; \{\, z \in X \times X : z_0 = z_1 \,\} \;=\; \{\, (x,x) : x \in X \,\} ,$$

the second description being the first read through the definition of a point of
the product as a function on $2$. It is a subset of $X \times X$ and is given the
subspace topology ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]) whenever it is regarded as a
space.

**The diagonal map.** The **diagonal map** of $X$ is

$$\delta_X : X \to X \times X, \qquad \delta_X(x) := (x,x) ,$$

that is, the function sending $x$ to the constant function $2 \to X$ with value
$x$. Its two components are $\pi_0 \circ \delta_X = \mathrm{id}_X$ and
$\pi_1 \circ \delta_X = \mathrm{id}_X$, and by claim 2 of
[[thm-product-universal-property]] it is the *unique* function $X \to X \times X$
with those two components. The same claim makes it **continuous**
([[def-continuous-map-top]]), the identity being continuous. Its image is
$\Delta_X$, and it is injective, since $\delta_X(x) = \delta_X(x')$ forces
$x = x'$ by reading the coordinate at $0$. Whether $\delta_X$ is an **embedding**
onto $\Delta_X$ ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]) is not asserted here; it is
the content of the next item.

**The pairing of two maps.** For functions $f : Z \to X$ and $g : Z \to Y$ on a
common domain, the **pairing** is

$$\langle f, g \rangle : Z \to X \times Y, \qquad \langle f, g \rangle(z) := (f(z), g(z)) .$$

By claim 2 of [[thm-product-universal-property]] it is the unique function
$Z \to X \times Y$ with $\pi_0 \circ \langle f, g \rangle = f$ and
$\pi_1 \circ \langle f, g \rangle = g$; no hypothesis on $f$ and $g$ is needed
for the pairing to be defined, and continuity of the pairing is exactly
continuity of both components, which is again that claim. In this notation

$$\delta_X = \langle \mathrm{id}_X, \mathrm{id}_X \rangle ,$$

so the diagonal map is a special case of the pairing and needs no separate
treatment.

**The preimage identity that every later proof uses.** For $f, g : Z \to Y$,

$$\langle f, g \rangle^{-1}[\Delta_Y] \;=\; \{\, z \in Z : f(z) = g(z) \,\} ,$$

directly from the definitions above: $\langle f, g \rangle(z) \in \Delta_Y$ says
that the function $(f(z), g(z))$ on $2$ takes the same value at $0$ and at $1$.

## Remarks

- **The diagonal is a subset of a product, and the diagonal map is a function
  into it; they are different objects with the same name.** The set $\Delta_X$
  records which pairs are repetitions, and the map $\delta_X$ produces the
  repetitions. Both are needed: the closedness criterion of this page is about the
  set, and the transport of properties from $X$ to its copy inside the square is
  about the map.

- **Nothing here depends on a choice principle.** The product $X \times X$ is a
  binary product, and a point of it is exhibited by naming its two coordinates;
  the nonemptiness of an arbitrary product, which is where choice enters
  ([[thm-product-universal-property]], claim 4), is never invoked for a binary
  product with a named point.

- **Why the box description is recorded at the top.** The criterion proved on
  this page tests basic open sets of $X \times X$, and for the binary product
  there is no gap between the box topology and the product topology to worry
  about ([[def-product-topology]]). No infinite product is formed anywhere on
  this page, so the distinction never becomes live here.

## Statement

Let $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ be topological spaces, with subspaces carrying the subspace
topology ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]). Then:

1. **Composites.** If $f : X \to Y$ and $g : Y \to Z$ are continuous
   ([[def-continuous-map-top]]) then $g \circ f : X \to Z$ is continuous.
2. **Open cover.** Let $f : X \to Y$ be a function and let
   $\{\, U_i : i \in I \,\}$ be a family of open subsets of $X$ with
   $\bigcup_{i \in I} U_i = X$. If $f|_{U_i} : U_i \to Y$ is continuous for every
   $i \in I$, then $f$ is continuous.
3. **Finite closed cover.** Let $f : X \to Y$ be a function, let $n \ge 1$ and
   let $F_1, \dots, F_n$ be closed subsets of $X$ with
   $F_1 \cup \dots \cup F_n = X$. If $f|_{F_k} : F_k \to Y$ is continuous for
   every $k$, then $f$ is continuous.

The converses of claims 2 and 3 hold with no hypothesis on the cover at all:
every restriction of a continuous map to a subspace is continuous
([[def-subspace-topology-top]]). The finiteness in claim 3 is not removable; see
the remarks.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Topological spaces $X$, $Y$, $Z$; functions $f : X \to Y$ and $g : Y \to Z$; a family $\{\, U_i : i \in I \,\}$ of open subsets of $X$ covering $X$; a natural $n \ge 1$ and closed subsets $F_1, \dots, F_n$ of $X$ covering $X$. For $S \subseteq X$ and $W \subseteq Y$ one has $(f|_S)^{-1}[W] = f^{-1}[W] \cap S$, and $(g \circ f)^{-1}[W'] = f^{-1}[g^{-1}[W']]$ for $W' \subseteq Z$.

[A1] $f$ is continuous if and only if preimages of open sets are open, if and only if preimages of closed sets are closed ([[thm-continuity-characterisations-top]], clauses (b) and (c)).

[A2] The subspace topology on $S \subseteq X$ has as its open sets the traces $U \cap S$ with $U$ open in $X$, and as its closed sets the traces $F \cap S$ with $F$ closed in $X$; if $S$ is open in $X$ then every set open in $S$ is open in $X$, and if $S$ is closed in $X$ then every set closed in $S$ is closed in $X$ ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]).

[L1] A topology is closed under arbitrary unions of open sets (T2), and its closed sets are closed under finite unions (C3) ([[def-topological-space]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Claim 1: let $W \subseteq Z$ be open; then $g^{-1}[W]$ is open in $Y$ and hence $f^{-1}[g^{-1}[W]]$ is open in $X$, and this set is $(g \circ f)^{-1}[W]$; so $g \circ f$ is continuous. [given, A1]

1.2 Let $V \subseteq Y$ be open. For each $i \in I$ the set $f^{-1}[V] \cap U_i = (f|_{U_i})^{-1}[V]$ is open in the subspace $U_i$, because $f|_{U_i}$ is continuous; and $U_i$ is open in $X$, so this set is open in $X$. [given, A1, A2]

1.3 Let $F \subseteq Y$ be closed. For each $k \le n$ the set $f^{-1}[F] \cap F_k = (f|_{F_k})^{-1}[F]$ is closed in the subspace $F_k$, because $f|_{F_k}$ is continuous; and $F_k$ is closed in $X$, so this set is closed in $X$. [given, A1, A2]

2.1 Since the $U_i$ cover $X$, $f^{-1}[V] = \bigcup_{i \in I} (f^{-1}[V] \cap U_i)$, a union of sets open in $X$ by step 1.2, hence open in $X$ by (T2). As $V$ was an arbitrary open subset of $Y$, $f$ is continuous, which is claim 2. [step 1.2, given, A1, L1]

2.2 Since the $F_k$ cover $X$, $f^{-1}[F] = \bigcup_{k=1}^{n} (f^{-1}[F] \cap F_k)$, a union of finitely many sets closed in $X$ by step 1.3, hence closed in $X$ by (C3) iterated, the union being over $n \ge 1$ sets. As $F$ was an arbitrary closed subset of $Y$, $f$ is continuous, which is claim 3. [step 1.3, given, A1, L1]

3.1 Claims 1, 2 and 3 are established by step 1.1, step 2.1 and step 2.2 respectively. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **The finiteness in claim 3 is not removable.** The witness is on the companion page: $\mathbb{R}$ with its usual topology is covered by its closed singletons, every restriction of the indicator function of $\{0\}$ to a singleton is continuous, and that function is not continuous ([[cex-pasting-fails-for-an-infinite-closed-cover]]). No corresponding restriction is needed in claim 2.

- **Where each hypothesis is spent.** Claim 2 uses openness of the cover members only to pass from "open in $U_i$" to "open in $X$", and it allows an arbitrary index set because arbitrary unions of open sets are open. Claim 3 uses closedness of the cover members for the corresponding passage, and it must restrict to finitely many because only *finite* unions of closed sets are closed. The two asymmetries of the topology axioms are visible in the two statements, one each.

- **The usual two-piece form.** Claim 3 with $n = 2$ is the pasting lemma as it is normally quoted: if $X = F_1 \cup F_2$ with both pieces closed and $f_1 : F_1 \to Y$, $f_2 : F_2 \to Y$ are continuous and agree on $F_1 \cap F_2$, then the combined function is well defined and continuous. Well definedness is the agreement hypothesis and is not a topological matter; continuity is claim 3.

- **Continuity is a local property, and claim 2 is the precise sense.** A function continuous in a neighbourhood of each point is continuous, because the interiors of those neighbourhoods form an open cover. No such statement holds for uniform notions, which is why nothing here is called *uniform*.

## Statement

Let $(X_i, \mathcal{T}_i)_{i \in I}$ be topological spaces and let
$P := \prod_{i \in I} X_i$ carry the product topology, with projections $\pi_j$
([[def-product-topology]]). Then:

1. **The projections are continuous**, and the product topology is the coarsest
   topology on $P$ making all of them continuous.
2. **Characteristic property.** For every space $Z$ and every function
   $h : Z \to P$,
   $$h \text{ is continuous } \iff \pi_i \circ h \text{ is continuous for every } i \in I .$$
   The functions $\pi_i \circ h$ are the **components** of $h$, and every family
   of functions $h_i : Z \to X_i$ arises from exactly one $h$, namely
   $h(z)(i) := h_i(z)$.
3. **The projections are open maps** ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]), for
   the product topology and for the box topology alike. They need not be closed;
   that failure is recorded on this page as a false statement.
4. **Surjectivity.** If every $X_i$ is nonempty then every $\pi_j$ is surjective.
   For $I$ a natural number this is a theorem of ZF ([[lem-finite-choice]]); for
   an arbitrary $I$ it is the Axiom of Choice ([[def-axiom-of-choice]]), and this
   is the only place in the item where a choice principle is used.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Topological spaces $(X_i,\mathcal{T}_i)_{i \in I}$, the product $P = \prod_{i \in I} X_i$ with the product topology and the projections $\pi_j(x) = x_j$, a space $Z$ and a function $h : Z \to P$, and an index $j \in I$.

[A1] The product topology on $P$ is the initial topology of $(\pi_i)_{i \in I}$, and a basis for it is the family of boxes $\prod_i U_i$ with every $U_i$ open and $U_i = X_i$ for all but finitely many $i$; a basis for the box topology is the family of all boxes $\prod_i U_i$ with every $U_i$ open ([[def-product-topology]], [[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]).

[A2] $f$ is an open map when $f[U]$ is open in the target for every open $U$ in the source ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]).

[L1] For a topology given as an initial topology of a family $(f_i)$: each $f_i$ is continuous, the topology is the coarsest with that property, and a map $h$ into it is continuous exactly when every $f_i \circ h$ is ([[thm-initial-and-final-characteristic-properties]], claims 1 and 2; [[def-initial-and-final-topology]], [[def-continuous-map-top]]).

[L2] If $F$ is a function with domain a natural number $n$ whose values are nonempty sets, then the family of its values has a choice function ([[lem-finite-choice]], [[def-choice-function]]).

[L3] If every member of a family of sets is nonempty then the product of the family is nonempty; this is the Axiom of Choice ([[def-axiom-of-choice]], [[def-choice-function]]).

[L4] The image of a union is the union of the images, and an arbitrary union of open sets is open ([[def-topological-space]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [A1] the product topology is an initial topology, so [L1] gives claim 1 and claim 2 at once, the defining family being $(\pi_i)_{i \in I}$. [A1, L1]

1.2 For a family of functions $h_i : Z \to X_i$ the assignment $h(z)(i) := h_i(z)$ defines a function $Z \to P$, since $h(z)$ has domain $I$ and $h(z)(i) = h_i(z) \in X_i$; it satisfies $\pi_i \circ h = h_i$, and any $h'$ with $\pi_i \circ h' = h_i$ for every $i$ satisfies $h'(z)(i) = h_i(z) = h(z)(i)$ for all $z$ and $i$, hence $h' = h$. [given]

1.3 Let $B = \prod_i U_i$ be a box with every $U_i$ open. If $B = \varnothing$ then $\pi_j[B] = \varnothing$. If $B \ne \varnothing$, fix $b \in B$; then $\pi_j[B] = U_j$, since $\pi_j[B] \subseteq U_j$ by definition, and for $u \in U_j$ the function $y$ with $y_j := u$ and $y_i := b_i$ for $i \ne j$ lies in $B$ and has $\pi_j(y) = u$. [A1, choose]

1.4 Assume every $X_i$ is nonempty and $I$ is a natural number $n$. By [L2] applied to $i \mapsto X_i$ there is a choice function $g$ for the family of values, and $x(i) := g(X_i)$ defines a point of $P$; so $P \ne \varnothing$. [L2]

1.5 Assume every $X_i$ is nonempty and $I$ is arbitrary. By [L3] the product $P$ is nonempty. [L3]

2.1 Both the box topology and the product topology have a basis consisting of boxes, by [A1], and the image of a union of basic sets is the union of their images; so by step 1.3 the image under $\pi_j$ of any open set of either topology is a union of sets each of which is $\varnothing$ or an open $U_j \subseteq X_j$, hence open. This is claim 3. [step 1.3, A1, A2, L4]

2.2 Assume every $X_i$ is nonempty and let $t \in X_j$. By step 1.4 when $I$ is a natural number, and by step 1.5 in general, there is a point $p \in P$; the function $y$ with $y_j := t$ and $y_i := p_i$ for $i \ne j$ then lies in $P$ and satisfies $\pi_j(y) = t$. So $\pi_j$ is surjective, which is claim 4. [step 1.4, step 1.5]

3.1 Step 1.1 gives claims 1 and 2, step 1.2 gives the bijection between maps into $P$ and families of component maps, step 2.1 gives claim 3 and step 2.2 gives claim 4. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.1, step 2.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Exactly where choice is spent, and where it is not.** Openness of the
  projections (claim 3) is choice free: step 1.3 uses a *single* point of the box
  in question, which is given by the assumption that the box is nonempty, and
  builds the required preimage from it by changing one coordinate. Surjectivity
  (claim 4) is different, because there the point has to be produced from nothing
  but nonemptiness of the factors, and for an infinite index set that is the
  Axiom of Choice itself.

- **The characteristic property is what makes the product topology the right
  one.** The box topology has no analogue of claim 2: a map into a box-topologised
  product may have all components continuous and fail to be continuous, and the
  companion page exhibits the diagonal of $\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}$ doing exactly
  that.

- **Openness does not survive to closedness.** A projection is always open and is
  in general not closed, and the standard witness, the hyperbola in
  $\mathbb{R}^2$, is worked in the false statement on this page. There is no
  asymmetry of taste here: images of open boxes are computed coordinatewise,
  while a closed set of the product need not be a union of closed boxes at all.
