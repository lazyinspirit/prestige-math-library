## Definition

Let $X,Y$ be topological spaces. A continuous map $f:X\to Y$ is a **homotopy equivalence** if there is a continuous map $g:Y\to X$ such that

$$g\circ f\simeq\operatorname{id}_X\qquad\text{and}\qquad f\circ g\simeq\operatorname{id}_Y$$

in the sense of [[def-homotopy-relative-and-path-homotopy]]. Such a $g$ is a **homotopy inverse** of $f$.

The spaces $X$ and $Y$ have the **same homotopy type**, or are **homotopy equivalent**, written $X\simeq Y$, when a homotopy equivalence $X\to Y$ exists.

The equations required of an ordinary inverse have been weakened to homotopies. Neither composite need equal the corresponding identity map, and a homotopy equivalence need not be bijective.

## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be topological spaces
([[def-topological-space]]), let $f : X \to Y$ be a function and let $x \in X$.
Neighbourhoods are as in [[def-neighbourhood-top]].

$f$ is **continuous at $x$** if for every neighbourhood $V$ of $f(x)$ in $Y$ the
preimage $f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ in $X$.

$f$ is **continuous** if it is continuous at every point of $X$.

**The same condition with open sets only.** $f$ is continuous at $x$ if and only
if for every open $V \subseteq Y$ with $f(x) \in V$ there is an open
$U \subseteq X$ with $x \in U$ and $f[U] \subseteq V$. Indeed, if $f$ is
continuous at $x$ and $V$ is such an open set, then $V$ is a neighbourhood of
$f(x)$, so $f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ and contains an open $U \ni x$,
which satisfies $f[U] \subseteq V$. Conversely, given the displayed condition and
a neighbourhood $V$ of $f(x)$, fix open $V_0$ with $f(x) \in V_0 \subseteq V$ and
then open $U \ni x$ with $f[U] \subseteq V_0$; then $x \in U \subseteq f^{-1}[V_0] \subseteq f^{-1}[V]$,
so $f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$. Both forms are used below and are the
same statement written twice.

**Preimage, not image.** $f^{-1}[V] = \{\, x \in X : f(x) \in V \,\}$
is the preimage in the sense of [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]] and is
defined for every function, invertible or not; no inverse function is being
asserted to exist. Continuity is a condition on preimages throughout, and the
corresponding conditions on images define the *open* and *closed* maps of a later
item, which are different notions.

## Remarks

- **This is the metric definition when both topologies are metric topologies.**
  For metric spaces, $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ continuity at $a$
  ([[def-metric-continuity]]) says that every ball around $f(a)$ has a ball
  around $a$ mapped into it, and the balls around a point are a neighbourhood
  base there; the identification is carried out where metrizable spaces are
  defined later on this page. Nothing about a metric survives in the definition
  above: continuity is a relation between two topologies and a function, and it
  is meaningless to ask whether a function between bare sets is continuous.

- **Continuity depends on both topologies, and coarsening the target or refining
  the source only helps.** If $f$ is continuous and $\mathcal{T}_X$ is replaced
  by a finer topology, or $\mathcal{T}_Y$ by a coarser one, $f$ remains
  continuous, since each condition to be verified is weakened and each
  neighbourhood available in the source is still available. In particular every
  map out of a discrete space and every map into an indiscrete space is
  continuous ([[def-standard-topologies]]).

- **Continuity at a point is strictly weaker than continuity.** A function may be
  continuous at exactly one point, and the definition above is deliberately local
  so that the sequential criteria proved later can be stated pointwise.

## Definition

Write $I=[0,1]$ with its usual subspace topology, as in [[def-path-connected]]. Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces, and let $f,g:X\to Y$ be continuous maps ([[def-continuous-map-top]]).

A **homotopy from $f$ to $g$** is a continuous map

$$H:X\times I\longrightarrow Y$$

from the product space ([[def-product-topology]]) such that $H(x,0)=f(x)$ and $H(x,1)=g(x)$ for every $x\in X$. When such an $H$ exists, $f$ and $g$ are **homotopic**, written $f\simeq g$.

Let $A\subseteq X$ carry the subspace topology ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]). The homotopy $H$ is a **homotopy relative to $A$**, or a homotopy **rel $A$**, when

$$H(a,t)=f(a)=g(a)\qquad(a\in A,\ t\in I).$$

Thus a homotopy rel $A$ can exist only when $f|_A=g|_A$, and every ordinary homotopy is a homotopy rel $\varnothing$. We write $f\simeq_A g$ when a homotopy rel $A$ exists.

If $\alpha,\beta:I\to Y$ are paths with the same initial point and the same terminal point ([[def-path-connected]]), a **path homotopy from $\alpha$ to $\beta$ relative to the endpoints** is a homotopy $H:I\times I\to Y$ rel $\{0,1\}$. Explicitly,

$$H(s,0)=\alpha(s),\quad H(s,1)=\beta(s),\quad H(0,t)=\alpha(0)=\beta(0),\quad H(1,t)=\alpha(1)=\beta(1).$$

The first coordinate $s$ parametrises the path and the second coordinate $t$ parametrises the deformation.

## Remarks

- The adjective *relative* means pointwise fixed throughout the deformation, not merely mapped back into $A$.
- A homotopy is a map on a product. A family of maps $H_t(x):=H(x,t)$ is not by itself a homotopy unless the joint map $(x,t)\mapsto H_t(x)$ is continuous.
