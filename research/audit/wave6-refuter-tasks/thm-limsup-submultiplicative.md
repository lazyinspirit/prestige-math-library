## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ be **bounded** sequences of reals ([[def-sequence]]) with
$x_k \ge 0$ and $y_k \ge 0$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$. Then
$\limsup_k x_k$, $\limsup_k y_k$ and $\limsup_k (x_k y_k)$ are **real numbers**,
all $\ge 0$, and

$$\limsup_{k} (x_k y_k) \;\le\; \Big(\limsup_{k} x_k\Big)\Big(\limsup_{k} y_k\Big).$$

**Both hypotheses are doing work.** Boundedness makes all three quantities real,
so that the product on the right is a product in the field $\mathbb{R}$ and no
extended multiplication is involved; without it the right-hand side could be an
undefined product $0 \cdot (+\infty)$ ([[def-extended-reals]]). Nonnegativity is
what lets two upper estimates be multiplied: for sequences of mixed sign the
inequality is false in the stated form, since a product of two negative numbers
is positive and the estimate would point the wrong way. Strictness is possible,
and a witness is recorded on the companion page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Bounded sequences $(x_k)$, $(y_k)$ of reals with $x_k \ge 0$ and $y_k \ge 0$ for every $k$; their termwise product $(x_k y_k)$; and $\Lambda := \limsup_k x_k$, $M := \limsup_k y_k$, $P := \limsup_k(x_k y_k)$ ([[def-limsup-liminf]]).

[L1] Tail ranges $T_n$, extended tail suprema $s_n = \sup T_n$ and $\limsup_k z_k = \inf\{s_n\}$ all exist for every sequence; $s_n$ is the least upper bound of $T_n$ and $\limsup$ the greatest lower bound of $\{s_n\}$ ([[lem-limsup-exists]], [[lem-extended-reals-complete]], [[def-limsup-liminf]], [[def-upper-bound]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L2] The order on $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is total and transitive, restricts on $\mathbb{R}$ to the order of $\mathbb{R}$, and has $+\infty$ greatest and $-\infty$ least; a member of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ lying between two reals is itself real ([[def-extended-reals]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L3] Epsilon characterisation for a real limit superior: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ one has $z_k < \limsup_k z_k + \varepsilon$ eventually ([[lem-limsup-epsilon-characterisation]]).

[L4] Boundedness of a sequence of reals: there is a real $B$ with $|z_k| \le B$ for every $k$; and $z \le |z|$ always ([[def-sequence]], [[def-bounded-set]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L5] Products of inequalities: $0 \le a \le b$ and $0 \le c \le d$ give $ac \le bd$, which [[prop-of-multiply-inequalities]] states in exactly this nonstrict form; and multiplication by a positive element preserves the order, [[lem-of-sign-rules]] stating the strict form $a < b \iff ac < bc$ and the nonstrict form following by adjoining the case $a = b$, where the two products are equal.

[L6] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: inequalities may be added and translated, and the order is total, so exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

[L7] Reciprocal Archimedean property: for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $m \ge 1$ with $1/m < \eta$; and $0 < a \le b$ gives $0 < 1/b \le 1/a$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

[L8] Two properties each holding eventually hold together from the larger of the two thresholds on, the order on $\mathbb{N}$ being total ([[def-sequence]], [[def-nat-order]], [[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Both sequences are bounded, so there are reals bounding $|x_k|$ and $|y_k|$; let $B$ be the larger of the two, so that $|x_k| \le B$ and $|y_k| \le B$ for every $k$, and $B \ge |x_0| \ge 0$. With $x_k \ge 0$ and $y_k \ge 0$ this gives $0 \le x_k \le B$ and $0 \le y_k \le B$ for every $k$, hence $0 \le x_k y_k \le B \cdot B$ by [L5]. [given, L4, L5, L6]

2.1 Each of $\Lambda$, $M$, $P$ is a real number $\ge 0$. Indeed, for every $n$ the real $B$ is an upper bound of the $n$-th tail range of $(x_k)$, so $s_n \le B$ and hence $\Lambda \le s_0 \le B$; and $s_n \ge x_n \ge 0$ for every $n$, so $0$ is a lower bound of $\{s_n\}$ and $0 \le \Lambda$. Being between the reals $0$ and $B$, the element $\Lambda$ is real. The same argument gives $0 \le M \le B$, and, using the bound $B \cdot B$ from step 1.1, $0 \le P \le B \cdot B$. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

3.1 Let $\delta > 0$ be an arbitrary real and put $C := \Lambda + M + 1$, a real with $C \ge 1 > 0$. Take a natural $m_1 \ge 1$ with $1/m_1 < 1$ and a natural $m_2 \ge 1$ with $1/m_2 < \delta/C$, let $m$ be the larger of $m_1$ and $m_2$, and set $\varepsilon := 1/m$, so that $0 < \varepsilon < 1$ and $\varepsilon C < \delta$. By [L3] there are thresholds beyond which $x_k < \Lambda + \varepsilon$ and beyond which $y_k < M + \varepsilon$; let $N$ be the larger. For $k \ge N$ we have $0 \le x_k \le \Lambda + \varepsilon$ and $0 \le y_k \le M + \varepsilon$, so $x_k y_k \le (\Lambda + \varepsilon)(M + \varepsilon) = \Lambda M + \varepsilon(\Lambda + M + \varepsilon) \le \Lambda M + \varepsilon C < \Lambda M + \delta$, the middle step because $\Lambda + M + \varepsilon \le C$ and $\varepsilon > 0$. Hence $\Lambda M + \varepsilon C$ is an upper bound of the $N$-th tail range of $(x_k y_k)$, so $P \le \Lambda M + \varepsilon C < \Lambda M + \delta$. [step 2.1, L1, L3, L5, L6, L7, L8, algebra]

4.1 Suppose $P > \Lambda M$. Both are real by step 2.1, so $\delta_0 := P - \Lambda M > 0$, and step 3.1 applied with $\delta = \delta_0$ gives $P < \Lambda M + \delta_0 = P$, which is impossible. By totality $P \le \Lambda M$, which is the asserted inequality. [step 3.1, step 2.1, L2, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- **The estimate is the product of two one-sided estimates, and that is why
  nonnegativity is needed.** Step 3.1 multiplies $x_k \le \Lambda + \varepsilon$
  by $y_k \le M + \varepsilon$, which is legitimate only when all four quantities
  are $\ge 0$ ([[prop-of-multiply-inequalities]]). For sequences of mixed sign the
  same two estimates say nothing about the product; the correct general statement
  in that setting involves absolute values and is not needed on this page.

- **The error term is linear in $\varepsilon$ with a fixed coefficient.**
  Expanding gives $\varepsilon(\Lambda + M + \varepsilon)$, and restricting to
  $\varepsilon < 1$ replaces the varying coefficient by the constant
  $C = \Lambda + M + 1$, after which one choice of $\varepsilon$ makes the whole
  error smaller than the prescribed $\delta$. Both restrictions on $\varepsilon$
  are met at once by taking the larger of two Archimedean choices.

- **The inequality is strict for some bounded nonnegative pairs**, and
  [[cex-limsup-product-strict]] on the companion page is the witness: there the
  product sequence is identically $0$ while the right-hand side is $4$.

- **The bounded hypothesis is not merely for convenience.** Without it $\Lambda$
  could be $+\infty$ and $M$ could be $0$, and then the right-hand side is not an
  element of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ at all ([[def-extended-reals]]); the
  behaviour of the products in that situation really is unconstrained, as
  [[cex-zero-times-infinity-indeterminate]] shows.

## Statement refuted

That the submultiplicativity of [[thm-limsup-submultiplicative]] can be improved
to an equality: that for all bounded nonnegative sequences $(x_k)$, $(y_k)$ of
reals,
$$\limsup_{k}(x_k y_k) = \Big(\limsup_{k} x_k\Big)\Big(\limsup_{k} y_k\Big).$$

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The alternating sequence $(s_k)$ of [[lem-alternating-sequence]] and the index maps $e, o$; the sequences $x_k := 1 + s_k$ and $y_k := 1 - s_k$, which are the families usually written $1 + (-1)^k$ and $1 + (-1)^{k+1}$; and the tail ranges $T_n$ of [[def-limsup-liminf]].

[L1] The alternating sequence: $|s_k| = 1$ for every $k$, $s_{e_j} = 1$ and $s_{o_j} = -1$, and $e$, $o$ are strictly increasing with $n_j \ge j$ ([[lem-alternating-sequence]], [[lem-index-map-grows]]).

[L2] Limit superior in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$: existence for every sequence, and the least-upper-bound and greatest-lower-bound descriptions of the tail bounds ([[def-limsup-liminf]], [[lem-limsup-exists]], [[lem-extended-reals-complete]], [[def-upper-bound]], [[def-partial-order]], [[def-extended-reals]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L3] Absolute value: $|t| = 1$ forces $t = 1$ or $t = -1$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]]).

[L4] Order and field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $0 < 2 = 1 + 1$ and $0 < 4 = 2 \cdot 2$; $1 + 1 = 2$, $1 - 1 = 0$, $1 + (-1) = 0$ and $1 - (-1) = 2$; a product with a zero factor is $0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L5] Submultiplicativity: for bounded nonnegative sequences, $\limsup_k(x_k y_k) \le (\limsup_k x_k)(\limsup_k y_k)$, all three quantities being real ([[thm-limsup-submultiplicative]]).

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Each $s_k$ is $1$ or $-1$. When $s_k = 1$ the pair $(x_k, y_k)$ is $(2, 0)$, and when $s_k = -1$ it is $(0, 2)$. In either case $0 \le x_k \le 2$ and $0 \le y_k \le 2$, so both sequences are bounded and nonnegative, and $x_k y_k = 0$ because one of the two factors is $0$. [given, L1, L3, L4]

1.2 For every $n$ both cases occur at an index $\ge n$: $s_{e_n} = 1$ with $e_n \ge n$ and $s_{o_n} = -1$ with $o_n \ge n$. [given, L1]

2.1 Hence $T_n(x) = \{0, 2\}$ and $T_n(y) = \{0, 2\}$ for every $n$, each with least upper bound $2$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, since $2$ bounds both elements and belongs to the set; so $\limsup_k x_k = \limsup_k y_k = 2$. The product sequence is constantly $0$, so $T_n(x y) = \{0\}$ and $\limsup_k (x_k y_k) = 0$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L2, L4]

3.1 The hypotheses of [L5] are met by step 1.1, and the inequality it gives reads $0 \le 2 \cdot 2 = 4$. Since $0 < 4$, it is strict, so the equality asserted above fails for this pair and the refuted claim is false. [step 2.1, step 1.1, L4, L5] ∎

## Remarks

- **The two sequences vanish at complementary indices.** Wherever $x_k$ attains
  its maximum $2$, its partner $y_k$ is $0$, so the product is $0$ everywhere and
  the two limit superiors are attained along disjoint sets of indices. This is the
  multiplicative form of the phase mismatch behind
  [[cex-limsup-subadditivity-strict]].

- **Nonnegativity and boundedness are satisfied, so the failure is not
  degenerate.** Both hypotheses of [[thm-limsup-submultiplicative]] hold, and the
  right-hand side is an honest product of real numbers; the inequality simply
  cannot be reversed.

- **The gap can be made total.** Here the product sequence is identically zero
  while the bound is $4$, so no fraction of the bound is achieved. Equality does
  hold when one of the two sequences converges, for the same reason as in the
  additive case.

## Statement refuted

That the product $0 \cdot (+\infty)$, left undefined by [[def-extended-reals]],
could be given a value compatible with limits: that there is
$v \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ such that for all sequences of reals with
$x_k \to 0$ ([[def-real-limit]]) and $y_k \to +\infty$
([[def-divergence-to-infinity]]) the products $x_k y_k$ have the single limiting
behaviour named by $v$.

Equivalently: that knowing a factor is null and the other diverges to $+\infty$
determines anything at all about the product. It does not, and the two undefined
entries in the arithmetic of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ are undefined for exactly
this reason.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The canonical naturals $\iota(n) = n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$; the sequence $x_k := 1/\iota(k+1)$; for a real $c > 0$ the sequence $y^{(c)}_k := c\,\iota(k+1)$; and the sequence $z_k := \iota(k+1)\,\iota(k+1)$.

[L1] Canonical naturals: $\iota(n) > 0$ and invertible for $n \ge 1$, $\iota$ is strictly increasing, and $\iota(n) \ge 1$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[def-nat-order]], [[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

[L2] Archimedean facts: for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $p \ge 1$ with $1/p < \eta$, and for every real $M$ there is a natural $p \ge 1$ with $M < \iota(p)$; and $0 < u < v$ gives $0 < 1/v < 1/u$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

[L3] Convergence to a real and divergence to $+\infty$; to establish convergence it suffices to produce a threshold for every real $\varepsilon > 0$; a constant sequence converges to its value ([[def-real-limit]], [[def-sequence]], [[def-divergence-to-infinity]]).

[L4] A sequence diverging to $+\infty$ is unbounded and therefore does not converge to any real ([[def-divergence-to-infinity]], [[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]]); a limit, when it exists, is unique ([[lem-limit-unique]]).

[L5] Order and field arithmetic: multiplying an inequality by a positive element preserves it; $0 < 1 < 2$ and $1 \ne 2$; $u \cdot (1/u) = 1$ for $u \ne 0$; and the algebra of limits ([[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[cor-of-one-positive]], [[thm-algebra-of-limits]], [[def-integer-power]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L6] The product $0 \cdot (\pm\infty)$ is left undefined in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-extended-reals]]).

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The sequence $x_k = 1/\iota(k+1)$ is well defined, positive, and converges to $0$: given a real $\varepsilon > 0$, take a natural $p \ge 1$ with $1/p < \varepsilon$; for $k \ge p$ we have $\iota(k+1) > \iota(p) > 0$, hence $0 < x_k < 1/p < \varepsilon$. [given, L1, L2, L3]

1.2 For every real $c > 0$ the sequence $y^{(c)}_k = c\,\iota(k+1)$ diverges to $+\infty$: given a real $M$, the quotient $M/c$ is real, so there is a natural $p \ge 1$ with $M/c < \iota(p)$, and for $k \ge p$ we get $\iota(k+1) > \iota(p) > M/c$, hence $y^{(c)}_k = c\,\iota(k+1) > M$ after multiplying by $c > 0$. [given, L1, L2, L3, L5]

1.3 The sequence $z_k = \iota(k+1)\iota(k+1)$ diverges to $+\infty$: given a real $M$, take a natural $p \ge 1$ with $M < \iota(p)$; for $k \ge p$ we have $\iota(k+1) \ge 1$ and $\iota(k+1) > \iota(p) > M$, so $z_k \ge \iota(k+1) > M$. [given, L1, L2, L3, L5]

2.1 For every real $c > 0$ the product sequence is constant: $x_k y^{(c)}_k = \big(1/\iota(k+1)\big)\,c\,\iota(k+1) = c$ for every $k$, so it converges to $c$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L3, L5]

2.2 The product with $(z_k)$ is $x_k z_k = \big(1/\iota(k+1)\big)\iota(k+1)\iota(k+1) = \iota(k+1)$, which diverges to $+\infty$ by the argument of step 1.3 with the single factor, and therefore converges to no real number. [step 1.1, step 1.3, L1, L2, L3, L4, L5]

3.1 Now take the three pairs $(x, y^{(1)})$, $(x, y^{(2)})$ and $(x, z)$. In each, the first sequence is null and the second diverges to $+\infty$, so each pair satisfies the hypotheses of the refuted claim; but the three products converge to $1$, converge to $2$, and converge to $+\infty$ in the extended sense. Since $1 \ne 2$ and limits are unique, no single $v \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ describes all three, and the claim is false. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L4, L5, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- **This is why the entry is blank in the table.** [[def-extended-reals]] leaves $0 \cdot (\pm\infty)$ undefined not out of caution but because any value assigned to it would make some instance of a product rule false, and the three pairs above already realise three different behaviours.

- **The same phenomenon rules out $(+\infty) + (-\infty)$.** Taking $a_k = \iota(k)$ and $b_k = -\iota(k)$ gives a sum that is constantly $0$, while $a_k = \iota(k)$ and $b_k = -\iota(k) - \iota(k)$ gives a sum diverging to $-\infty$; both pairs have $a_k \to +\infty$ and $b_k \to -\infty$.

- **Measure theory's convention is not a counterexample to this.** Texts that set $0 \cdot \infty := 0$ are fixing the value of a *formula* in a context where the factor $0$ is the measure of a null set, not asserting a limit rule; the distinction is spelled out in [[rem-extended-real-conventions]].

- **Index range.** The classical statement writes $x_k = 1/k$ and $y_k = ck$, which requires $k \ge 1$. Written on $\mathbb{N}$, which contains $0$ ([[def-sequence]]), the same sequences are $1/(k+1)$ and $c(k+1)$, as above.

## Statement

Let $F$ be a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and let
$\varepsilon \in F$ with $\varepsilon > 0$. Then there is a natural number
$n \ge 1$ such that

$$\frac{1}{n \cdot 1_F} < \varepsilon ,$$

where $n \cdot 1_F$ is the canonical natural of $F$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]]) and
$1/(n \cdot 1_F)$ is its multiplicative inverse ([[def-field]]). As is standard
we abbreviate $n \cdot 1_F$ to $n$ and write the conclusion $1/n < \varepsilon$.

This is the **reciprocal form** of the Archimedean property.
[[thm-of-archimedean]] on its own delivers only the assertion that the canonical
naturals are cofinal, $x < n \cdot 1_F$; the form actually used in analysis, that
the reciprocals of the naturals get below every positive bound, is the statement
above, and it is recorded separately so that no proof has to reconstruct the
inversion step in passing.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $F$ and an element $\varepsilon \in F$ with $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] Archimedean property: for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Inverses and order: if $a > 0$ then $a^{-1} > 0$, and if $0 < a < b$ then $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Field arithmetic: an element $a$ with $a > 0$ is nonzero by trichotomy, hence has a multiplicative inverse $a^{-1}$, and $(a^{-1})^{-1} = a$ ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Since $\varepsilon > 0$, trichotomy gives $\varepsilon \ne 0$, so $\varepsilon^{-1}$ exists, and $\varepsilon^{-1} > 0$. [given, L2, L3]

2.1 Apply [L1] to $x = \varepsilon^{-1}$: fix a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $\varepsilon^{-1} < n \cdot 1_F$. [step 1.1, L1, choose]

3.1 Chaining the two displayed inequalities gives $0 < \varepsilon^{-1} < n \cdot 1_F$; in particular $n \cdot 1_F > 0$, so $n \cdot 1_F \ne 0$ and $1/(n \cdot 1_F)$ is defined. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L3]

4.1 Apply the second claim of [L2] with $a = \varepsilon^{-1}$ and $b = n \cdot 1_F$: $0 < (n \cdot 1_F)^{-1} < (\varepsilon^{-1})^{-1}$. [step 3.1, L2]

5.1 By [L3], $(\varepsilon^{-1})^{-1} = \varepsilon$, so the natural number $n \ge 1$ fixed in step 2.1 satisfies $1/(n \cdot 1_F) < \varepsilon$, which is the assertion. [step 4.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Monotonicity gives the eventual form for free.** If $m \ge n \ge 1$ then
  $m \cdot 1_F \ge n \cdot 1_F > 0$, because $k \mapsto k \cdot 1_F$ is strictly
  increasing on the naturals $\ge 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]), and so
  $1/(m \cdot 1_F) \le 1/(n \cdot 1_F) < \varepsilon$ by [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]
  again. So the corollary yields not merely one index but a threshold: every
  $m \ge n$ satisfies $1/m < \varepsilon$. That one extra line is what a
  convergence proof needs, and it is left to the caller rather than folded into
  the statement, because the caller usually has a threshold of its own to combine
  it with.

- **Completeness is used only through [[thm-of-archimedean]].** Nothing here
  needs the least-upper-bound property directly. The corollary therefore holds
  verbatim in any Archimedean ordered field, in particular in $\mathbb{Q}$, and
  it fails in a non-Archimedean ordered field, where an infinitesimal
  $\varepsilon > 0$ is below every $1/n$ by construction.

- The equivalence is exact: the reciprocal form implies the cofinal form back
  again, since given $x > 0$ one applies it to $\varepsilon = 1/x$. The two are
  the same property written on the two sides of the inversion, and only the
  direction proved above is used in this library.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ denotes the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a subset of it.

The notions **upper bound** and **bounded above** are already fixed by
[[def-complete-ordered-field]] and are only recalled here, never redefined:
$u \in \mathbb{R}$ is an *upper bound* of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$, and
$S$ is *bounded above* if it has at least one upper bound. The dual notions are:

- $\ell \in \mathbb{R}$ is a **lower bound** of $S$ if $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.
- $S$ is **bounded below** if it has at least one lower bound.
- $S$ is **bounded** if it is both bounded above and bounded below, that is, if
  there are $\ell, u \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\ell \le s \le u$ for every $s \in S$.

## Remarks

- A bound is an element of $\mathbb{R}$ and is not required to lie in $S$. A
  bound that does lie in $S$ is a maximum or a minimum ([[def-max-min]]), and
  that is a strictly stronger condition ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Bounds come in half-lines: if $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$ then so is every
  $\ell'' \le \ell$, and if $u$ is an upper bound then so is every $u'' \ge u$.
  Consequently a set that has one bound of a given kind has infinitely many, and
  the interesting question is whether the collection of them has a best element,
  which is what a supremum ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) or an infimum
  ([[def-infimum]]) is.
- Bounded above and bounded below are independent conditions. The set
  $A = \{\, n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} : n \ge 1 \,\}$ of canonical naturals of
  $\mathbb{R}$ is bounded below by $0$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]) and is not
  bounded above ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); its reflection $-A$ is bounded above
  and not bounded below ([[lem-reflection]]).
- The empty set is bounded, and vacuously so: every real number is both an upper
  bound and a lower bound of $\emptyset$, since the defining condition quantifies
  over no elements. Having bounds is therefore much weaker than having a least
  upper bound or a greatest lower bound ([[fs-every-set-has-sup]]).

## Definition

Fix two objects $-\infty$ and $+\infty$, distinct from one another and neither of
them a real number ([[def-real-numbers]]), and set

$$\overline{\mathbb{R}} := \mathbb{R} \cup \{-\infty, +\infty\}.$$

This is a **new object**, introduced here explicitly with its own order and its
own partial arithmetic. It is not an enlargement of the field $\mathbb{R}$, and
no operation of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) is redefined by
anything below.

**The order.** For $a, b \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ declare

$$a \le b \quad :\Longleftrightarrow \quad a = -\infty \ \text{ or } \ b = +\infty \ \text{ or } \ \big(a, b \in \mathbb{R} \text{ and } a \le b \text{ in } \mathbb{R}\big),$$

with $\mathbb{R}$ ordered as in [[def-real-order]], and write $a < b$ for
"$a \le b$ and $a \ne b$" as usual ([[def-partial-order]]).

**$(\overline{\mathbb{R}}, \le)$ is a totally ordered set, and the inclusion of
$\mathbb{R}$ preserves and reflects the order.** All four checks are immediate
from the displayed clauses.

- *Reflexive.* For $a = \pm\infty$ one of the first two clauses applies; for
  $a \in \mathbb{R}$ the third does, since $a \le a$ in $\mathbb{R}$.
- *Antisymmetric.* Suppose $a \le b$ and $b \le a$. If $a = -\infty$ then
  $b \le a$ forces $b = -\infty$, since the clause $a = +\infty$ fails and $b, a$
  are not both real. Symmetrically $b = -\infty$ forces $a = -\infty$, and
  $a = +\infty$ or $b = +\infty$ forces the other to be $+\infty$. In the one
  remaining situation $a$ and $b$ are both real and antisymmetry is that of
  $\mathbb{R}$.
- *Transitive.* Let $a \le b \le c$. If $a = -\infty$ or $c = +\infty$ the
  conclusion is one of the first two clauses. Otherwise $a \ne -\infty$ forces,
  in $a \le b$, either $b = +\infty$ or $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$; and $c \ne +\infty$
  forces, in $b \le c$, either $b = -\infty$ or $b, c \in \mathbb{R}$. The value
  $b = +\infty$ is incompatible with the second alternative pair, so $b$ is real,
  hence so are $a$ and $c$, and transitivity is that of $\mathbb{R}$.
- *Total.* If $a = -\infty$ or $b = +\infty$ then $a \le b$; if $b = -\infty$ or
  $a = +\infty$ then $b \le a$; otherwise both are real and the order of
  $\mathbb{R}$ is total.
- *Preserved and reflected.* For $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ the first two clauses fail,
  so $a \le b$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ says exactly $a \le b$ in $\mathbb{R}$.

In particular $-\infty$ is the least and $+\infty$ the greatest element of
$\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, and $-\infty < x < +\infty$ for every $x \in \mathbb{R}$.

**Reflection.** Extend negation by

$$-(+\infty) := -\infty, \qquad -(-\infty) := +\infty,$$

keeping the field negative on $\mathbb{R}$. The resulting map
$\nu : \overline{\mathbb{R}} \to \overline{\mathbb{R}}$, $\nu(a) = -a$, satisfies
$\nu(\nu(a)) = a$ and

$$a \le b \iff -b \le -a \qquad (a, b \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}).$$

For $a$ and $b$ real this is the elementwise order reversal in $\mathbb{R}$:
translation invariance ([[lem-of-add-order]]) applied with the constant $-a-b$
turns $a < b$ into $-b < -a$ and, applied with the constant $a+b$, turns it back,
while $a = b$ holds exactly when $-a = -b$. In every other case both sides are
decided by the first two clauses of the order: $a = -\infty$ makes both sides
true, as does $b = +\infty$, and if $a \ne -\infty$, $b \ne +\infty$ and $a, b$
are not both real then one of $a = +\infty$, $b = -\infty$ holds and both sides
are false.

**Partial addition.** For $a, b \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ the sum $a + b$ is
defined by

- $a + b$ = the field sum, when $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$;
- $a + b := +\infty$ when $a = +\infty$ and $b \ne -\infty$, or $b = +\infty$ and $a \ne -\infty$;
- $a + b := -\infty$ when $a = -\infty$ and $b \ne +\infty$, or $b = -\infty$ and $a \ne +\infty$;

and **the two sums $(+\infty) + (-\infty)$ and $(-\infty) + (+\infty)$ are left
undefined**. Addition is commutative where defined, and

$$-(a + b) = (-a) + (-b),$$

each side being defined exactly when the other is: the excluded pairs
$\{+\infty, -\infty\}$ are exchanged by $\nu$, and the three clauses above are
exchanged accordingly.

**Partial multiplication.** For $a, b \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ the product $ab$
is defined by

- $ab$ = the field product, when $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$;
- $ab := +\infty$ when one of $a, b$ is $\pm\infty$, the other is $\ne 0$, and both are $> 0$ or both are $< 0$;
- $ab := -\infty$ when one of $a, b$ is $\pm\infty$, the other is $\ne 0$, and one is $> 0$ and the other $< 0$;

and **every product with one factor $0$ and the other $\pm\infty$ is left
undefined**. The comparisons $> 0$ and $< 0$ here are taken in the order above,
under which $+\infty > 0 > -\infty$.

**Nothing else is defined.** There is no subtraction, no division, no
exponentiation and no absolute value on $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ in this library;
where such an expression is wanted it is written out in the two defined
operations, and where a case falls in the undefined list the statement carries an
explicit hypothesis saying so.

## Remarks

- **$\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is not a field, and not an ordered field.** It has no
  additive inverse for $+\infty$: $(+\infty) + b$ is $+\infty$ whenever it is
  defined and is never $0$. So none of the field axioms
  ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) is available here, and no algebraic
  manipulation valid in $\mathbb{R}$ may be transported to
  $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ without a separate justification.

- **Why the excluded cases are excluded.** The three defined clauses of each
  operation are exactly the cases in which the value is forced by the limiting
  behaviour of the sequences involved, and the excluded cases are exactly the
  ones in which it is not. For the product this is proved on the companion page:
  [[cex-zero-times-infinity-indeterminate]] exhibits a null sequence and two
  sequences diverging to $+\infty$ whose products behave differently, so no value
  assigned to $0 \cdot (+\infty)$ could be compatible with products of limits.
  The same phenomenon rules out a value for $(+\infty) + (-\infty)$: with
  $a_k = k$ and $b_k = -k$ the sum is constantly $0$, while with $b_k = -2k$ it
  diverges to $-\infty$. Leaving them undefined is not squeamishness, it is the
  only option that keeps every later statement about limits true without a
  side condition hidden inside the arithmetic.

- **This is the separate introduction that [[rem-sup-conventions]] points to.**
  That remark refuses the conventions $\sup S = +\infty$ and
  $\inf \emptyset = +\infty$ inside $\mathbb{R}$, and records that the extended
  real line is introduced explicitly here, with its own order and its own partial
  arithmetic kept separate from $\mathbb{R}$ rather than quietly extending it.
  This is that introduction. The suprema and infima of [[def-complete-ordered-field]],
  [[def-infimum]] and the whole suprema page remain real numbers with their
  nonempty and bounded hypotheses intact; what is new is a *separate* supremum
  operation, taken in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ and named as such, supplied by
  [[lem-extended-reals-complete]].

- **The symbols were already in circulation, and this definition does not change
  what they meant.** [[def-divergence-to-infinity]] defines the single phrase
  "$x_k \to +\infty$" as an abbreviation for a condition on $(x_k)$, and says in
  as many words that it does not define an object named $+\infty$. That reading
  is still correct: nothing in [[def-divergence-to-infinity]] is restated or
  reinterpreted here, and [[def-extended-limits]] is where the two are related, by
  a definition that quotes the old one rather than replacing it. Likewise the
  interval notation $(a, \infty)$ of [[def-interval]] is notation for a condition
  on one side, not an endpoint, and stays that way.

- **Why the order is defined by three clauses rather than by a picture.** The
  clauses are what the verifications above actually use, and they make the two
  facts that later proofs lean on immediate: every element is $\le +\infty$ and
  every element is $\ge -\infty$, with no case analysis at the point of use.

## Definition

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]). For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ let

$$T_n \;:=\; \{\, x_k : k \in \mathbb{N},\ k \ge n \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$$

be the **$n$-th tail range** of $(x_k)$, a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ since
$x_n \in T_n$. Regard $T_n$ as a subset of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$
([[def-extended-reals]]) and put

$$s_n \;:=\; \sup T_n \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}, \qquad i_n \;:=\; \inf T_n \in \overline{\mathbb{R}},$$

the supremum and infimum taken in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, which exist for every
$n$ and for every sequence by [[lem-extended-reals-complete]]. The **limit
superior** and **limit inferior** of $(x_k)$ are then

$$\limsup_{k} x_k \;:=\; \inf \{\, s_n : n \in \mathbb{N} \,\}, \qquad \liminf_{k} x_k \;:=\; \sup \{\, i_n : n \in \mathbb{N} \,\},$$

again taken in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ and again existing by
[[lem-extended-reals-complete]], since $\{s_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ and
$\{i_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ are subsets of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ on which no
hypothesis is needed. Both are elements of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, and either may
be $+\infty$ or $-\infty$. The notations $\limsup_{k \to \infty} x_k$,
$\varlimsup_k x_k$ and $\overline{\lim}_k x_k$ all denote the first of them
elsewhere; this library writes $\limsup_k x_k$.

**Every quantity written here exists, and that is why the extended line was
introduced.** Each of the four operations above is an application of
[[lem-extended-reals-complete]] to a subset of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ carrying no
hypothesis whatever. Written with the real supremum of
[[def-complete-ordered-field]] and the real infimum of [[thm-infimum-property]]
instead, the definition would be available only for sequences that are bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]): $\sup T_n$ needs $T_n$ bounded above, and
$\inf\{s_n\}$ needs $\{s_n\}$ nonempty, bounded below, and made of real numbers
([[def-infimum]]). None of those is automatic, and the discipline recorded in
[[rem-sup-conventions]] forbids papering over the gap with a convention. The
extended supremum is a different operation in a different ordered set, and it is
total.

**Values, when the sequence is bounded.** If $(x_k)$ is bounded, say
$|x_k| \le M$ for every $k$, then each $T_n$ is a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$
bounded above by $M$ and below by $-M$, so by the agreement clause of
[[lem-extended-reals-complete]] each $s_n$ and each $i_n$ is the *real* supremum
or infimum of $T_n$, and lies in $[-M, M]$. The family $\{s_n\}$ is then a
nonempty set of reals bounded below by $-M$, so $\limsup_k x_k$ is likewise the
real infimum of $\{s_n\}$ and lies in $[-M, M]$; dually for $\liminf_k x_k$. So
for a bounded sequence both quantities are ordinary real numbers computed with
the ordinary real supremum and infimum, and the extended line is doing no work.
It is only for unbounded sequences that the values $\pm\infty$ occur.

## Remarks

- **The order of the two operations is not symmetric and must be kept straight.**
  $\limsup$ is an infimum of suprema and $\liminf$ a supremum of infima. Taking
  them in the other order gives $\sup_n \sup_{k \ge n} x_k = \sup_k x_k$ and
  $\inf_n \inf_{k \ge n} x_k = \inf_k x_k$, which are the extreme values of the
  whole sequence and carry no information about its behaviour at large indices.
  The point of the definition is that the inner operation looks at a tail and the
  outer one lets the tail recede.

- **Why tails at all.** Each $s_n$ is a bound on the whole tail from index $n$ on,
  so it forgets the first $n$ terms; letting $n$ grow forgets any fixed finite
  number of them. That is what makes $\limsup$ and $\liminf$ tail quantities in
  the sense of [[lem-limit-of-tail]], and it is the reason they can characterise
  convergence, which is itself a tail property.

- **Neither quantity is a limit, and neither is claimed to be one.** The symbols
  $\limsup$ and $\liminf$ are single pieces of notation for the two displayed
  expressions, exactly as "$x_k \to +\infty$" is a single abbreviation in
  [[def-divergence-to-infinity]]. That the family $(s_n)$ does decrease to
  $\limsup_k x_k$ in a precise sense is a theorem, not part of this definition;
  the monotonicity half is [[lem-limsup-exists]].

- **The tail ranges are sets, not sequences.** $T_n$ is the range of the $n$-th
  tail, so repetitions and order are forgotten ([[def-sequence]]). That is
  harmless here, since a supremum depends only on the set of values, and it is
  what lets the whole definition be phrased with the order-theoretic operations of
  [[lem-extended-reals-complete]] and nothing else.

## Definition

For $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, define the **order** by

$$m \le n \iff \exists k \in \mathbb{N}\ (m + k = n),$$

and the **strict order** by $m < n \iff (m \le n \text{ and } m \neq n)$, using
addition ([[def-nat-addition]]).

## Remarks

Read $m \le n$ as "$n$ is $m$ plus something": the gap $k$ with $m + k = n$ is
unique when it exists (by commutativity and cancellation,
[[lem-nat-add-commutative]], [[lem-nat-add-cancellative]]) and is
written $n - m$ once subtraction is available. That $\le$ is genuinely a linear
order, reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive, and total, is proved in
[[thm-nat-linear-order]] and [[lem-nat-trichotomy]]; compatibility with the
arithmetic ([[lem-nat-order-add-compatible]],
[[lem-nat-order-mult-compatible]]) and discreteness
($m < n \iff \sigma(m) \le n$, [[lem-nat-discrete]]) follow.

In the von Neumann model this order coincides with membership and inclusion:
$m \le n \iff m \subseteq n$ and $m < n \iff m \in n$, matching the picture of
each natural number as the set $\{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ of its predecessors
([[def-natural-numbers]]). That coincidence is not proved here; it is derived
from the additive definition above on a later page. The least-element property of every nonempty subset,
the **well-ordering principle** ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]), is the deepest
consequence.

## Definition

Let $P$ be a set. A **partial order** on $P$ is a binary relation $\le$ on $P$
such that, for all $x, y, z \in P$:

- **(R)** *reflexivity*: $x \le x$;
- **(A)** *antisymmetry*: if $x \le y$ and $y \le x$, then $x = y$;
- **(T)** *transitivity*: if $x \le y$ and $y \le z$, then $x \le z$.

The pair $(P, \le)$ is a **partially ordered set**, abbreviated **poset**. When
the order is clear we write $P$ for the pair.

The associated **strict order** is defined by
$$x < y \quad :\Longleftrightarrow \quad x \le y \text{ and } x \ne y.$$

Two elements $x, y \in P$ are **comparable** if $x \le y$ or $y \le x$, and
**incomparable** otherwise. A partial order in which every two elements are
comparable is a **total order** (equivalently a **linear order**), and $(P, \le)$
is then a **totally ordered set**.

## Remarks

- Partiality is the whole point: a partial order is permitted to leave pairs
  incomparable, which is what makes maximal elements and chains worth
  distinguishing at all. In a total order every subset is a chain, and a maximal
  element is automatically the greatest element.
- All three axioms are used essentially in the proofs that rest on this
  definition: reflexivity in [[lem-extremal-cut-closed-under-f]] and
  [[lem-successor-of-extremal]],
  transitivity almost everywhere, and antisymmetry in [[thm-bourbaki-witt]],
  where the fixed point is obtained by passing from $f(c) \le c$ and
  $c \le f(c)$ to $f(c) = c$. Antisymmetry is also what makes a least upper
  bound unique when it exists, and uniqueness is what licenses the functional
  notation $\sup$ used in [[def-chain-complete-poset]].
- Dropping antisymmetry gives a **preorder**. Preorders are genuinely useful
  elsewhere (a directed set is preordered).
- Inclusion $\subseteq$ on the power set of any set is the standard example, and
  it is the order that appears concretely in [[thm-zorn]], which applies
  [[thm-bourbaki-witt]] to the set of chains of $P$ ordered by inclusion, and in
  [[thm-zorn-implies-ac]], which applies Zorn's lemma to partial choice
  functions ordered by extension, an inclusion order on their graphs. The
  results themselves are stated for an *arbitrary* poset and are used that way:
  [[thm-zorn]] is applied to whatever poset a later page brings, and the
  refutation in
  [[fs-maximal-is-greatest]] runs in a bare two-element antichain that is not
  presented as an order by inclusion at all.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]],
[[def-real-numbers]]) with its order and absolute value ([[def-real-order]]), and
$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers with its order ([[def-natural-numbers]],
[[def-nat-order]]).

A **sequence of reals** is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$. We write
$x_k$ for the value $x(k)$, call it the **$k$-th term**, and write $(x_k)$, or
$(x_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$, for the function itself. The **range** of $(x_k)$ is
the subset $\{\, x_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals and let $P$ be a property of indices.

- $(x_k)$ is **bounded** if there is $M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for
  every $k \in \mathbb{N}$; it is **unbounded** otherwise.
- $P$ holds **eventually** if there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $P(k)$ holds
  for every $k \ge K$.
- $P$ holds **frequently** if for every $K \in \mathbb{N}$ there is some
  $k \ge K$ for which $P(k)$ holds.
- For $K \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$K$-th tail** of $(x_k)$ is the sequence
  $x^{(K)}$ defined by $x^{(K)}_j := x_{j + K}$ for $j \in \mathbb{N}$; it is
  again a sequence of reals.
- A function $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is **strictly increasing** if
  $n_j < n_k$ whenever $j < k$. For such an $n$, the **subsequence** of $(x_k)$
  along $n$ is the composite $x \circ n$, written $(x_{n_k})_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$;
  it is again a sequence of reals.

**Convergence and Cauchyness are not defined here.** They are already fixed, for
sequences of reals, by the published [[def-real-limit]]: $(x_k)$ *converges* to
$x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is
$K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$, and $(x_k)$
is *Cauchy* when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$
with $|x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$. This page builds the
toolkit for those two notions and does not restate them. A sequence
**converges** if it converges to some real, and **diverges** if it does not.

## Remarks

- **Identification of $\mathbb{Q}$ with its image.** The map $q \mapsto \hat q$
  is an embedding of ordered fields ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and as is
  standard we write $q$ for $\hat q$, so that a rational may be compared with a
  real without further comment. [[def-real-limit]] is stated with the hat; every
  rational $\varepsilon$ occurring on this page is its image under this
  embedding.

- **Rational and real $\varepsilon$ agree.** [[def-real-limit]] tests convergence
  against every *rational* $\varepsilon > 0$, and its own remark records that
  this loses nothing. Spelled out: suppose that for every rational
  $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all
  $k \ge K$, and let $\eta > 0$ be an arbitrary *real*. Since $0 < \eta$,
  density of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) supplies a
  rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, and the index $K$
  belonging to that $\varepsilon$ satisfies $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon < \eta$ for
  all $k \ge K$. The converse implication is immediate, since every positive
  rational is a positive real. So the two formulations define the same relation,
  and the same two lines apply verbatim to the Cauchy condition and to any
  condition of the shape "for every $\varepsilon > 0$, eventually
  $\cdots < \varepsilon$". Proofs on this page therefore run the test with a real
  $\varepsilon$ wherever that is more convenient, and say so by citing this
  remark; nothing is smuggled in.

- **Constant sequences converge.** For $c \in \mathbb{R}$ the constant sequence
  $x_k := c$ converges to $c$, because $|x_k - c| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ for
  every $\varepsilon > 0$ and every $k$; it is bounded by $|c|$.

- **Eventually and frequently are dual.** $P$ holds frequently exactly when
  $\lnot P$ does not hold eventually, and $P$ holds eventually exactly when
  $\lnot P$ does not hold frequently. So the two quantifier patterns are
  negations of one another applied to the complementary property, and there is no
  third pattern hiding between them.

- **A sequence is not its range.** $(x_k)$ is a function, not a set, and the
  range does not determine the function: the sequence $x_0 = 0$, $x_k = 1$ for
  $k \ge 1$ and the sequence $y_0 = y_1 = 0$, $y_k = 1$ for $k \ge 2$ have the
  same range $\{0, 1\}$, yet they differ at $k = 1$, so they are different
  sequences. Order and repetition are part of the data and the range forgets
  both. Boundedness, on the other hand, depends only on the range.

- **Indexing.** Sequences here start at $k = 0$ because $\mathbb{N}$ contains
  $0$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]). Texts that index from $1$ describe the same
  objects up to a shift, and the shift changes nothing about convergence, by
  [[lem-limit-of-tail]].

## Definition

Let $(P, \le)$ be a poset ([[def-partial-order]]) and $S \subseteq P$.

An element $u \in P$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \le u$ for every
$s \in S$.

An element $u \in P$ is a **least upper bound** (or **supremum**) of $S$ if $u$
is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le v$ for every upper bound $v$ of $S$. When it
exists we write $u = \sup S$.

An element $u \in P$ is a **strict upper bound** of $S$ if $s < u$ for every
$s \in S$.

## Remarks

- **A least upper bound is unique when it exists.** If $u$ and $u'$ are both
  least upper bounds of $S$ then each is an upper bound and each is below the
  other, so $u \le u'$ and $u' \le u$, whence $u = u'$ by antisymmetry
  ([[def-partial-order]]). This is what makes the notation $\sup S$ legitimate.
  Antisymmetry is not peculiar to this argument: the same two-inequality step
  gives uniqueness of a greatest element ([[def-maximal-element]]), and it is
  used essentially in [[thm-bourbaki-witt]], whose fixed point is obtained by
  passing from $f(c) \le c$ and $c \le f(c)$ to $f(c) = c$. Drop antisymmetry
  and it is the conclusion, not merely the notation, that goes: on two distinct
  elements each below the other, every subset still has a least upper bound, yet
  the map exchanging the two satisfies $x \le f(x)$ and has no fixed point.
- **Every element of $P$ is an upper bound of the empty set**, vacuously.
  Consequently $\sup \emptyset$, when it exists, is the least element of $P$.
- An upper bound of $S$ need not belong to $S$, and $S$ may have many upper
  bounds and no least one. In $\mathbb{Q}$ with its usual order, the set
  $\{q \in \mathbb{Q} : q^2 < 2\}$ has upper bounds but no least upper bound.
- In a poset, a strict upper bound is exactly an upper bound outside $S$. If
  $u$ is strict then $u\notin S$, since $u<u$ is impossible. Conversely, if
  $u$ is an upper bound and $u\notin S$, then every $s\in S$ satisfies
  $s\le u$ and $s\ne u$, hence $s<u$. This distinction from an arbitrary upper
  bound matters in [[thm-zorn]], where the argument must produce one outside
  the chain.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ be **any** subset of the extended real
line ([[def-extended-reals]]) and write $A_{\mathbb{R}} := A \cap \mathbb{R}$.
Then $A$ has a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound in
$\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-upper-bound]]), each unique, which we write
$\sup A$ and $\inf A$ with the ambient set always $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$.
Explicitly:

- $\sup A = +\infty$ if $+\infty \in A$, or if $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ is not bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$;
- $\sup A = -\infty$ if $+\infty \notin A$ and $A_{\mathbb{R}} = \emptyset$;
- $\sup A$ is the real supremum $\sup A_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) if $+\infty \notin A$ and $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ is nonempty and bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$;

and dually, with $-\infty$ and $+\infty$ exchanged and "above" replaced by
"below", for $\inf A$ ([[def-infimum]], [[thm-infimum-property]]).

**Agreement.** If $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and bounded above in
$\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-bounded-set]]) then $\sup A$ computed in
$\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is the real number $\sup A$ of
[[def-complete-ordered-field]]; if $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and
bounded below then $\inf A$ computed in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is the real
number $\inf A$ of [[thm-infimum-property]]. In particular the notation is
unambiguous on the sets for which the real supremum and infimum are defined, and
$\sup \emptyset = -\infty$, $\inf \emptyset = +\infty$ in
$\overline{\mathbb{R}}$.

**No hypothesis is placed on $A$.** This is exactly what the real supremum cannot
do, and it is why every $\limsup$ statement on this page holds for every sequence
rather than for bounded ones only. It is also not a weakening of the discipline
this library keeps around suprema: the operation supplied here is a *different*
operation, taken in a *different* ordered set, and the agreement clause records
exactly where the two coincide.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $A \subseteq \overline{\mathbb{R}}$, and its real part $A_{\mathbb{R}} := A \cap \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] $(\overline{\mathbb{R}}, \le)$ is a totally ordered set in which $-\infty$ is the least element and $+\infty$ the greatest, and whose order restricted to $\mathbb{R}$ is the order of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-extended-reals]], [[def-partial-order]], [[def-real-order]]).

[L2] Upper and lower bounds in a poset: $u$ is an upper bound of $A$ when $a \le u$ for all $a \in A$, and a least upper bound when moreover $u \le v$ for every upper bound $v$; dually for lower bounds and greatest lower bounds. Each is unique when it exists, by antisymmetry ([[def-upper-bound]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L3] Least-upper-bound property of $\mathbb{R}$: every nonempty $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$ has a real least upper bound $\sup S$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L4] Greatest-lower-bound property of $\mathbb{R}$: every nonempty $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ that is bounded below in $\mathbb{R}$ has a real greatest lower bound $\inf S$ ([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]).

[L5] Bounded above and bounded below in $\mathbb{R}$ mean the existence of a real upper, respectively lower, bound ([[def-bounded-set]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Case S1 for the supremum: $+\infty \in A$. [given, assume-case suptop]

1.2 Case S2 for the supremum: $+\infty \notin A$ and $A_{\mathbb{R}} = \emptyset$, so that every element of $A$ equals $-\infty$. [given, assume-case supbot]

1.3 Case S3 for the supremum: $+\infty \notin A$, $A_{\mathbb{R}} \ne \emptyset$, and $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ is bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$. [given, assume-case supfin]

1.4 Case S4 for the supremum: $+\infty \notin A$, $A_{\mathbb{R}} \ne \emptyset$, and $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ is not bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$. [given, assume-case supunb]

1.5 Case I1 for the infimum: $-\infty \in A$. [given, assume-case infbot]

1.6 Case I2 for the infimum: $-\infty \notin A$ and $A_{\mathbb{R}} = \emptyset$, so that every element of $A$ equals $+\infty$. [given, assume-case inftop]

1.7 Case I3 for the infimum: $-\infty \notin A$, $A_{\mathbb{R}} \ne \emptyset$, and $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ is bounded below in $\mathbb{R}$. [given, assume-case inffin]

1.8 Case I4 for the infimum: $-\infty \notin A$, $A_{\mathbb{R}} \ne \emptyset$, and $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ is not bounded below in $\mathbb{R}$. [given, assume-case infunb]

2.1 In case S1 the element $+\infty$ is an upper bound of $A$, being the greatest element of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$; and if $v$ is any upper bound of $A$ then $+\infty \in A$ gives $+\infty \le v$, whence $v = +\infty$ by antisymmetry. So $+\infty$ is the least upper bound of $A$. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.2 In case S2 every element of $A$ equals $-\infty$, so $-\infty$ is an upper bound of $A$ by reflexivity; and $-\infty \le v$ for every $v \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$, being the least element. So $-\infty$ is the least upper bound of $A$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.3 In case S3 the real number $\sigma := \sup A_{\mathbb{R}}$ exists, and it is an upper bound of $A$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$: an element of $A$ is either real, hence lies in $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ and satisfies $a \le \sigma$ in $\mathbb{R}$ and so in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, or equals $-\infty$, which is $\le \sigma$; the value $+\infty$ does not occur in $A$ in this case. [step 1.3, L1, L3]

2.4 In case S4 the element $+\infty$ is an upper bound of $A$; and if $v$ is an upper bound then $v \ne -\infty$, because fixing $a \in A_{\mathbb{R}}$, which is possible in this case, gives $a \le v$ with $a$ real and $-\infty$ is below no real, while $v$ real would make $v$ a real upper bound of $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ and contradict the case hypothesis. So $v = +\infty$, and $+\infty$ is the least upper bound of $A$. [step 1.4, L1, L2, L5]

2.5 In case I1 the element $-\infty$ is a lower bound of $A$, being least; and any lower bound $w$ satisfies $w \le -\infty$ because $-\infty \in A$, whence $w = -\infty$ by antisymmetry. So $-\infty$ is the greatest lower bound of $A$. [step 1.5, L1, L2]

2.6 In case I2 every element of $A$ equals $+\infty$, so $+\infty$ is a lower bound of $A$ by reflexivity, and $w \le +\infty$ for every $w$. So $+\infty$ is the greatest lower bound of $A$. [step 1.6, L1, L2]

2.7 In case I3 the real number $\iota := \inf A_{\mathbb{R}}$ exists and is a lower bound of $A$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$: an element of $A$ is either real, hence in $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ and $\ge \iota$, or equals $+\infty \ge \iota$; the value $-\infty$ does not occur in $A$ in this case. [step 1.7, L1, L4]

2.8 In case I4 the element $-\infty$ is a lower bound of $A$; any lower bound $w$ satisfies $w \ne +\infty$, because fixing $a \in A_{\mathbb{R}}$ gives $w \le a$ with $a$ real and $+\infty$ is above no real, while $w$ real would be a real lower bound of $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ and contradict the case hypothesis. So $w = -\infty$ is the greatest lower bound of $A$. [step 1.8, L1, L2, L5]

3.1 In case S3 let $v$ be any upper bound of $A$ and fix $a \in A_{\mathbb{R}}$, which is possible since $A_{\mathbb{R}} \ne \emptyset$. From $a \le v$ with $a$ real we get $v \ne -\infty$, since $-\infty$ is below no real. If $v = +\infty$ then $\sigma \le v$ because $+\infty$ is greatest. Otherwise $v$ is real, and it bounds $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ above in $\mathbb{R}$, so $\sigma \le v$ by leastness of the real supremum. Hence $\sigma$ is the least upper bound of $A$. [step 1.3, step 2.3, L1, L2, L3]

3.2 In case I3 let $w$ be a lower bound of $A$ and fix $a \in A_{\mathbb{R}}$. From $w \le a$ with $a$ real we get $w \ne +\infty$. If $w = -\infty$ then $w \le \iota$; otherwise $w$ is real and bounds $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ below in $\mathbb{R}$, so $w \le \iota$. Hence $\iota$ is the greatest lower bound of $A$. [step 1.7, step 2.7, L1, L2, L4]

4.1 The four supremum cases are exhaustive and mutually exclusive: either $+\infty \in A$, which is S1, or not, and then either $A_{\mathbb{R}} = \emptyset$, which is S2, or $A_{\mathbb{R}} \ne \emptyset$ and it is bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$, which is S3, or it is not, which is S4. In each case a least upper bound was produced, and it is unique. The same four alternatives with $-\infty$, $+\infty$ and "below" in place of $+\infty$, $-\infty$ and "above" are I1 to I4, and in each a greatest lower bound was produced. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, step 2.4, step 2.5, step 2.6, step 3.2, step 2.8, L2, L5, cases: a two-fold split followed by a three-fold split, cases-exhaustive]

5.1 The agreement clause follows: a nonempty $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$ satisfies $+\infty \notin A$ and $A_{\mathbb{R}} = A$, so case S3 applies and $\sup A = \sup A_{\mathbb{R}}$ is the real supremum; a nonempty $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ bounded below satisfies case I3 and $\inf A$ is the real infimum; and $A = \emptyset$ falls under S2 and I2, giving $\sup \emptyset = -\infty$ and $\inf \emptyset = +\infty$. [step 2.3, step 3.1, step 2.7, step 3.2, step 4.1, L3, L4] ∎

## Remarks

- **What makes this work is that $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ has a top and a bottom.**
  The three defining clauses of the order ([[def-extended-reals]]) put $+\infty$
  above everything and $-\infty$ below everything, and every case above is settled
  by one of those two facts or by the least-upper-bound property of $\mathbb{R}$
  applied to the real part. Nothing else about $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is used,
  and in particular no arithmetic is used at all.

- **The two exceptional cases of [[fs-every-set-has-sup]] are not repaired, they
  are relocated.** That false statement records that in $\mathbb{R}$ a set may
  fail to have a supremum, and it stays true; the discipline of
  [[rem-sup-conventions]], which refuses to write $\sup S = +\infty$ inside
  $\mathbb{R}$, also stays in force. What is proved here is a statement about a
  different ordered set.

- **The empty set is not an exception here, and that is the point of the
  ambient set.** In $\mathbb{R}$ the empty set has no supremum, because every
  real is an upper bound and there is no least one.
  In $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ every element is still an upper bound of $\emptyset$,
  but now there *is* a least one, namely $-\infty$. The two statements are about
  different ordered sets and neither contradicts the other.

- **Where this is consumed.** [[def-limsup-liminf]] needs the supremum of a tail
  range of an arbitrary real sequence, which may be unbounded, and then the
  infimum of the resulting family, which may contain $+\infty$; both are supplied
  here and by nothing earlier in the library. Fourteen items on this page depend
  on it, and five more on the companion page of examples.

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]) and let $L \in \mathbb{R}$,
with *eventually* and *frequently* as in [[def-sequence]] and $\limsup$,
$\liminf$ as in [[def-limsup-liminf]].

1. $L = \limsup_{k} x_k$ **if and only if** for every real $\varepsilon > 0$
   $$x_k < L + \varepsilon \ \text{ eventually} \qquad \text{and} \qquad x_k > L - \varepsilon \ \text{ frequently}.$$
2. Dually, $L = \liminf_{k} x_k$ **if and only if** for every real
   $\varepsilon > 0$
   $$x_k > L - \varepsilon \ \text{ eventually} \qquad \text{and} \qquad x_k < L + \varepsilon \ \text{ frequently}.$$

**The hypothesis $L \in \mathbb{R}$ is not a restriction that can be lifted.**
Both conditions are stated with real $\varepsilon$ and real $L \pm \varepsilon$,
so neither has a reading at $L = \pm\infty$; the infinite cases are handled
instead by the convergence theorem later on this page. What the lemma does say
is that whenever $\limsup_k x_k$ happens to be a real number, it is pinned down by
the familiar two-sided test: nothing exceeds it by a fixed positive amount from
some index on, and something comes within any fixed positive amount of it
arbitrarily late.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals, a real number $L$, the tail ranges $T_n = \{x_k : k \ge n\}$, the extended tail suprema $s_n = \sup T_n$, and $\Lambda := \limsup_k x_k = \inf\{s_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ ([[def-limsup-liminf]]).

[L1] $\Lambda$ and every $s_n$ exist in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ for every sequence, and $\Lambda$ is the greatest lower bound of $\{s_n\}$ while $s_n$ is the least upper bound of $T_n$ ([[lem-extended-reals-complete]], [[lem-limsup-exists]], [[def-upper-bound]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L2] The order on $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is total, so the failure of $a \le b$ is $b < a$; it restricts on $\mathbb{R}$ to the order of $\mathbb{R}$; and every real number is $< +\infty$ and $> -\infty$ ([[def-extended-reals]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L3] A property $P$ of indices holds *eventually* when it holds for all $k \ge K$ for some $K$, and *frequently* when for every $K$ it holds for some $k \ge K$ ([[def-sequence]]).

[L4] Reciprocal Archimedean property: for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $m \ge 1$ with $1/m < \eta$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

[L5] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: for $\varepsilon > 0$ one has $L - \varepsilon < L < L + \varepsilon$, and $a < b$ if and only if $-b < -a$, both by translation invariance; the order is total, so exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds and $a < a$ is impossible ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L6] Reflection exchanges the two quantities: $\limsup_k(-x_k) = -\liminf_k x_k$ and $\liminf_k(-x_k) = -\limsup_k x_k$ ([[lem-limsup-reflection]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For the forward implication of claim 1, assume $L = \Lambda$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.2 For the converse implication of claim 1, assume that for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the sequence satisfies $x_k < L + \varepsilon$ eventually and $x_k > L - \varepsilon$ frequently. [assume-hyp, L3]

2.1 Under the assumption of step 1.1, $L + \varepsilon > L = \Lambda$, so $L + \varepsilon$ is not a lower bound of $\{s_n\}$, since $\Lambda$ is the greatest lower bound; by totality there is $n$ with $s_n < L + \varepsilon$. For every $k \ge n$ we have $x_k \le s_n$, hence $x_k < L + \varepsilon$; so $x_k < L + \varepsilon$ eventually. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L3, L5]

2.2 Under the assumption of step 1.1, fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Then $\Lambda \le s_n$ because $\Lambda$ is a lower bound of $\{s_n\}$, and $L - \varepsilon < L = \Lambda$, so $L - \varepsilon < s_n$. Hence $L - \varepsilon$ is not an upper bound of $T_n$, for an upper bound $u$ of $T_n$ satisfies $s_n \le u$; by totality of the order on $\mathbb{R}$ there is therefore $k \ge n$ with $x_k > L - \varepsilon$. As $n$ was arbitrary, $x_k > L - \varepsilon$ frequently. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L3, L5]

2.3 Under the assumption of step 1.2, let $\varepsilon > 0$ be a real and take $N$ with $x_k < L + \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge N$. Then $L + \varepsilon$ is an upper bound of $T_N$, so $s_N \le L + \varepsilon$ by leastness, and $\Lambda \le s_N$ because $\Lambda$ is a lower bound of $\{s_n\}$; hence $\Lambda \le L + \varepsilon$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L3]

2.4 Under the assumption of step 1.2, let $\varepsilon > 0$ be a real and fix $n$. There is $k \ge n$ with $x_k > L - \varepsilon$, and $x_k \le s_n$, so $L - \varepsilon < s_n$ and in particular $L - \varepsilon \le s_n$. As $n$ was arbitrary, $L - \varepsilon$ is a lower bound of $\{s_n\}$, so $L - \varepsilon \le \Lambda$ by greatest-lower-boundedness. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L3]

3.1 Taking $\varepsilon = 1$ in steps 2.3 and 2.4 gives $L - 1 \le \Lambda \le L + 1$ with $L \pm 1$ real, so $\Lambda$ is neither $+\infty$ nor $-\infty$ and is therefore a real number. Suppose $\Lambda > L$ and put $\delta := \Lambda - L > 0$; choosing a natural $m \ge 1$ with $1/m < \delta$ and applying step 2.3 with $\varepsilon = 1/m$ gives $\Lambda \le L + 1/m < L + \delta = \Lambda$, which is impossible. Suppose instead $\Lambda < L$ and put $\delta := L - \Lambda > 0$; choosing $m \ge 1$ with $1/m < \delta$ and applying step 2.4 with $\varepsilon = 1/m$ gives $L - 1/m \le \Lambda$, that is $\delta = L - \Lambda \le 1/m < \delta$, again impossible. By trichotomy $\Lambda = L$. [step 2.3, step 2.4, L2, L4, L5]

4.1 Steps 2.1 and 2.2 prove the forward implication of claim 1 and step 3.1 proves its converse, so claim 1 holds. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1]

5.1 For claim 2, note that $L = \liminf_k x_k$ holds exactly when $-L = -\liminf_k x_k = \limsup_k(-x_k)$, since negation is injective on $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$. Applying claim 1 to the sequence $(-x_k)$ and the real number $-L$, that holds exactly when for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ one has $-x_k < -L + \varepsilon$ eventually and $-x_k > -L - \varepsilon$ frequently. Negating each of the two inequalities reverses it, turning them into $x_k > L - \varepsilon$ eventually and $x_k < L + \varepsilon$ frequently, which is claim 2. [step 4.1, L5, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- **The two halves are not interchangeable.** "Eventually below $L + \varepsilon$"
  says $L$ is not exceeded in the long run; "frequently above $L - \varepsilon$"
  says $L$ is approached again and again. Weakening the first to *frequently*
  would make the condition hold for $L = \liminf$ as well, and strengthening the
  second to *eventually* would force convergence, which is exactly the extra
  content of [[thm-convergence-iff-limsup-equals-liminf]].

- **Real $\varepsilon$ is used throughout, and no rational test is involved.**
  Neither condition is a convergence statement, so [[def-real-limit]] and its
  quantification over rational $\varepsilon$ do not enter. Where a convergence
  hypothesis has to be fed into this lemma, as in
  [[thm-convergence-iff-limsup-equals-liminf]], the passage between rational and
  real $\varepsilon$ is made there, by the sanctioned remark of [[def-sequence]].

- **Why the epsilon lemmas for the real supremum are not cited.**
  [[lem-sup-epsilon]] and [[lem-inf-epsilon]] characterise the *real* supremum and
  infimum of a nonempty set bounded on the relevant side. Here $s_n$ may be
  $+\infty$ and the family $\{s_n\}$ may be unbounded below in $\mathbb{R}$, so
  neither lemma applies to the sets actually in play; the corresponding steps
  above are made directly from the least-upper-bound and greatest-lower-bound
  properties in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[lem-extended-reals-complete]]), which
  need no hypothesis.

- **The Archimedean property is what closes the converse.** Steps 2.3 and 2.4
  give $L - \varepsilon \le \Lambda \le L + \varepsilon$ for every positive real
  $\varepsilon$, and passing from that to $\Lambda = L$ needs a positive real
  strictly below any prescribed positive gap; [[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]]
  supplies $1/m$.

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]), with tail ranges $T_n$ and
extended tail bounds $s_n = \sup T_n$, $i_n = \inf T_n$ as in
[[def-limsup-liminf]].

1. **Monotonicity of the extended bounds under inclusion.** If
   $A \subseteq B \subseteq \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-extended-reals]]) then
   $$\sup A \le \sup B \qquad \text{and} \qquad \inf B \le \inf A,$$
   the four quantities being the extended bounds of [[lem-extended-reals-complete]].
   No hypothesis is placed on $A$ or $B$; in particular $A$ may be empty.
2. **The tail bounds are monotone.** $T_m \subseteq T_n$ whenever $n \le m$, and
   hence
   $$s_m \le s_n \qquad \text{and} \qquad i_n \le i_m \qquad (n \le m).$$
   In particular $s_{n+1} \le s_n$ and $i_n \le i_{n+1}$ for every $n$, and
   $i_n \le s_n$ for every $n$.
3. **Existence.** $\limsup_k x_k$ and $\liminf_k x_k$ exist in
   $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ for **every** sequence of reals, bounded or not.

Claim 1 is the tool the rest of this page uses whenever two extended suprema are
compared. It is proved here, from the definition of a least upper bound, rather
than quoted from the suprema page, for the reason given in the remarks below.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals, its tail ranges $T_n = \{x_k : k \ge n\}$, and the extended bounds $s_n = \sup T_n$, $i_n = \inf T_n$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-limsup-liminf]]).

[L1] Every subset of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ has a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, with no hypothesis on the subset ([[lem-extended-reals-complete]]).

[L2] Least upper bound and greatest lower bound in a poset: $\sup A$ is an upper bound of $A$ that is $\le$ every upper bound of $A$, and $\inf A$ is a lower bound that is $\ge$ every lower bound; each is unique when it exists ([[def-upper-bound]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L3] $(\overline{\mathbb{R}}, \le)$ is a totally ordered set, so its order is reflexive and transitive ([[def-extended-reals]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L4] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total and transitive ([[def-nat-order]], [[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $A \subseteq B \subseteq \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ be arbitrary. By [L1] the four elements $\sup A$, $\sup B$, $\inf A$, $\inf B$ of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ all exist and are uniquely determined. [given, L1, L2]

1.2 Let $n \le m$ in $\mathbb{N}$. Every element of $T_m$ has the form $x_k$ with $k \ge m$, and then $k \ge n$ by transitivity, so $x_k \in T_n$; hence $T_m \subseteq T_n$. [given, L4]

1.3 For every $n$ the tail range $T_n$ contains $x_n$, so $i_n \le x_n$ because $i_n$ is a lower bound of $T_n$, and $x_n \le s_n$ because $s_n$ is an upper bound of $T_n$; transitivity gives $i_n \le s_n$. [given, L1, L2, L3]

2.1 Since $\sup B$ is an upper bound of $B$ and $A \subseteq B$, every element of $A$ is $\le \sup B$, so $\sup B$ is an upper bound of $A$; as $\sup A$ is the least of the upper bounds of $A$, this gives $\sup A \le \sup B$. Dually $\inf B$ is a lower bound of $B$, hence of $A$, and as $\inf A$ is the greatest of the lower bounds of $A$ this gives $\inf B \le \inf A$. Claim 1 is proved. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

3.1 Applying claim 1 to the inclusion $T_m \subseteq T_n$ valid for $n \le m$ gives $s_m \le s_n$ and $i_n \le i_m$; the special case $m = n + 1$ gives $s_{n+1} \le s_n$ and $i_n \le i_{n+1}$. Together with $i_n \le s_n$ this is claim 2. [step 1.2, step 1.3, step 2.1]

4.1 The families $\{s_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ and $\{i_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ are subsets of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, so [L1] applies to them with no hypothesis, and $\limsup_k x_k = \inf\{s_n\}$ and $\liminf_k x_k = \sup\{i_n\}$ exist in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ for every sequence of reals. This is claim 3. [step 3.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Remarks

- **The monotonicity is where the two operations of the definition interlock.**
  Because $(s_n)$ is nonincreasing, the outer infimum in
  $\limsup_k x_k = \inf_n s_n$ is an infimum of a decreasing family, so it is the
  value the tail suprema are pressing down towards; and because $(i_n)$ is
  nondecreasing, $\liminf_k x_k = \sup_n i_n$ is the value the tail infima are
  pressing up towards. Nothing in this lemma says the pressing converges, and for
  an unbounded sequence there is nothing in $\mathbb{R}$ for it to converge to;
  the exact statement is [[lem-limsup-epsilon-characterisation]].

- **Why the word "nonincreasing" is spelled out rather than cited.**
  [[def-monotone-sequence]] defines monotone for sequences of *reals*, and
  $(s_n)$ takes values in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, so the definition does not
  apply to it. Claim 2 is therefore stated as the inequality it is. When $(x_k)$
  is bounded every $s_n$ is real ([[def-limsup-liminf]]) and $(s_n)$ is then a
  nonincreasing sequence of reals in the sense of [[def-monotone-sequence]], but
  no proof on this page needs that reading.

- **Claim 1 is not [[lem-sup-monotone]].** That lemma is the same one-line
  argument carried out in $\mathbb{R}$, and its statement carries the hypotheses
  that the smaller set be nonempty and the larger one bounded above, without
  which neither supremum denotes anything. Those are exactly the hypotheses that
  the extended bounds of [[lem-extended-reals-complete]] dispense with, so the
  extended statement is not an instance of the real one and is proved from the
  definition of a least upper bound instead.

- **Claim 1 costs nothing and is used everywhere.** It is the one-line poset
  argument: the larger set's supremum bounds the smaller set, and leastness does
  the rest. It is stated as part of this lemma rather than as an item of its own
  because it is used only in company with the tail bounds.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$, with
$|x|$ the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]). Then

$$|x| \ge 0; \quad |x| = 0 \iff x = 0; \quad -|x| \le x \le |x|; \quad |-x| = |x|; \quad |xy| = |x|\,|y|;$$

and, for every $c > 0$, one has $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and elements $x, y \in F$.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| = u$ if $u \ge 0$, and $|u| = -u$ if $u < 0$ ([[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Ordered-field order: trichotomy holds (for each $u$ exactly one of $u > 0$, $u = 0$, $u < 0$), $a < b$ means $b - a$ is positive, and sums and products of positives are positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Signs in products: $(-a)b = -(ab)$ and $(-a)(-b) = ab$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] Sign rules: a product of two elements of the same sign is positive, and a product of two elements of opposite sign is negative ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Case $x > 0$: by [L1] $|x| = x > 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; since $-x < 0$ we get $|-x| = -(-x) = x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -x < 0 < x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case pos, L1, L2, algebra]

1.2 Case $x = 0$: then $|x| = |0| = 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ holds with $|x| = 0$ and $x = 0$, while $|-x| = |0| = |x|$ and $-|x| = 0 \le 0 \le 0 = |x|$. [assume-case zero, L1]

1.3 Case $x < 0$: by [L1] $|x| = -x$, and [L2] gives $-x > 0$, so $|x| > 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; here $|-x| = -x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -(-x) = x \le x$ while $x < 0 < -x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case neg, L1, L2, algebra]

1.4 Case $x = 0$ or $y = 0$: then $xy = 0$, so $|xy| = 0$, and one of $|x|, |y|$ is $0$, whence $|x|\,|y| = 0 = |xy|$. [assume-case zerofactor, L1]

1.5 Case $x, y$ have the same sign (both positive or both negative): by [L4] $xy > 0$, so $|xy| = xy$, while $|x|\,|y| = xy$ by [L3] (for $x, y < 0$ this is $(-x)(-y) = xy$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case same, L1, L3, L4]

1.6 Case $x, y$ have opposite signs (one positive, one negative): by [L4] $xy < 0$, so $|xy| = -(xy)$, while $|x|\,|y| = -(xy)$ by [L3] (namely $x(-y)$ or $(-x)y$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case opposite, L1, L3, L4]

2.1 By trichotomy [L2] each $x$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.1-1.3, and in each we verified $|x| \ge 0$, that $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$, that $|-x| = |x|$, and that $-|x| \le x \le |x|$; hence all four hold for every $x$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, cases-exhaustive]

2.2 By trichotomy [L2] each pair $x, y$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.4-1.6, and in each $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$ for all $x, y$. [step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6, cases-exhaustive]

3.1 Let $c > 0$: if $|x| < c$ then $-c < -|x| \le x \le |x| < c$ by [step 2.1] and [L2], so $-c < x < c$; conversely if $-c < x < c$ then both $x < c$ and $-x < c$, and since $|x|$ equals $x$ or $-x$ by [L1], we get $|x| < c$, so $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$. [step 2.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b, c, d \in F$.

1. **Translation invariance.** If $a < b$ then $a + c < b + c$.
2. **Adding inequalities.** If $a < b$ and $c < d$ then $a + c < b + d$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b, c, d \in F$.

[L1] For $x, y \in F$, the relation $x < y$ means $y - x \in P$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] $P$ is closed under addition: if $u, v \in P$ then $u + v \in P$ (axiom O2 of [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a < b$; by the definition of the order this means $b - a \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.2 For every $c \in F$ the field identities give $(b + c) - (a + c) = b - a$. [algebra]

1.3 Assume moreover $c < d$; by the definition of the order this means $d - c \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.4 The field identities give $(b + d) - (a + c) = (b - a) + (d - c)$. [algebra]

2.1 Hence $(b + c) - (a + c) = b - a \in P$, which is exactly $a + c < b + c$, proving claim 1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1]

2.2 Since $b - a \in P$ and $d - c \in P$, closure under addition gives $(b - a) + (d - c) \in P$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, L2]

3.1 Therefore $(b + d) - (a + c) = (b - a) + (d - c) \in P$, which is exactly $a + c < b + d$, proving claim 2. [step 1.4, step 2.2, L1] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b \in F$.

1. If $a > 0$ then $a^{-1} > 0$.
2. If $0 < a < b$ then $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b \in F$.

[L1] $x > 0 \iff x \in P$; $x < 0 \iff -x \in P$; and for $x \neq 0$ exactly one of $x \in P$, $-x \in P$ holds ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Sign rules: a product of a positive and a negative is negative, a product of two positives is positive, and for $c > 0$ one has $a < b \iff ac < bc$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

[L3] $0 < 1$; in particular $1 \neq 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L4] $P$ is closed under addition, so $<$ is transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a > 0$, so $a \neq 0$ and its inverse $a^{-1}$ exists with $a \cdot a^{-1} = 1$; moreover $a^{-1} \neq 0$, since $a^{-1}$ has $a$ as its inverse while $0$ is non-invertible ($1 \neq 0$ by L3). [assume-hyp, L1, L3]

2.1 By trichotomy $a^{-1} \in P$ or $-a^{-1} \in P$; if $-a^{-1} \in P$, then $a > 0$ and $a^{-1} < 0$ give $a \cdot a^{-1} < 0$ by the sign rules, i.e. $1 < 0$, contradicting $0 < 1$; hence $a^{-1} \in P$, i.e. $a^{-1} > 0$, proving claim 1. [step 1.1, L2, L3, L1]

3.1 Assume $0 < a < b$; then $0 < b$ by transitivity, so by claim 1 both $a^{-1} > 0$ and $b^{-1} > 0$, and the sign rules give $a^{-1} b^{-1} > 0$. [assume-hyp, step 2.1, L4, L2, L1]

4.1 Multiplying $a < b$ by the positive $a^{-1} b^{-1}$ via the sign rules gives $a (a^{-1} b^{-1}) < b (a^{-1} b^{-1})$; since $a a^{-1} = 1$ and $b b^{-1} = 1$, this simplifies to $b^{-1} < a^{-1}$. [step 3.1, L2, algebra]

5.1 Together with $b^{-1} > 0$ from step 3.1, we conclude $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$, proving claim 2. [step 3.1, step 4.1] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b, c \in F$.

1. If $a > 0$ and $b > 0$ then $ab > 0$.
2. If $a > 0$ and $b < 0$ then $ab < 0$.
3. If $a < 0$ and $b < 0$ then $ab > 0$.
4. If $c > 0$ then $a < b \iff ac < bc$.
5. If $c < 0$ then $a < b \iff bc < ac$ (multiplication by a negative reverses order).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b, c \in F$.

[L1] For $x, y \in F$: $x < y \iff y - x \in P$; $x > 0 \iff x \in P$; $x < 0 \iff -x \in P$; and (trichotomy) for each $x$ exactly one of $x \in P$, $x = 0$, $-x \in P$ holds, so $0 \notin P$ and $x \in P \Rightarrow x \neq 0$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] $P$ is closed under multiplication: if $u, v \in P$ then $uv \in P$ (axiom O2 of [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] In any field, $(-u)v = -(uv)$ and $(-u)(-v) = uv$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] In any field, $0 \cdot u = 0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a > 0$ and $b > 0$, i.e. $a \in P$ and $b \in P$; closure gives $ab \in P$, so $ab > 0$, proving claim 1. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.2 Assume $a > 0$ and $b < 0$, i.e. $a \in P$ and $-b \in P$; closure gives $a(-b) \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.3 Assume $a < 0$ and $b < 0$, i.e. $-a \in P$ and $-b \in P$; closure gives $(-a)(-b) \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.4 Assume $c > 0$ and $a < b$, i.e. $c \in P$ and $b - a \in P$; closure gives $(b - a)c \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.5 Assume $c < 0$ and $a < b$, i.e. $-c \in P$ and $b - a \in P$; closure gives $(b - a)(-c) \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

2.1 Since $a(-b) = -(ab)$ by L3, step 1.2 gives $-(ab) \in P$, so $ab < 0$, proving claim 2. [step 1.2, L3, L1]

2.2 Since $(-a)(-b) = ab$ by L3, step 1.3 gives $ab \in P$, so $ab > 0$, proving claim 3. [step 1.3, L3, L1]

2.3 By distributivity $(b - a)c = bc - ac$, so step 1.4 gives $bc - ac \in P$, i.e. $ac < bc$: this is the forward direction of claim 4. [step 1.4, algebra, L1]

2.4 By L3 and distributivity $(b - a)(-c) = -((b - a)c) = -(bc - ac) = ac - bc$, so step 1.5 gives $ac - bc \in P$, i.e. $bc < ac$: this is the forward direction of claim 5. [step 1.5, L3, algebra, L1]

3.1 Conversely, assume $c > 0$ and $ac < bc$; by trichotomy exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds. If $a = b$ then $ac = bc$, contradicting $ac < bc$; if $b < a$ then the argument of step 2.3 applied to the pair $b < a$ gives $bc < ac$, so $bc - ac \in P$ (from $ac < bc$) while $ac - bc \in P$ (from $bc < ac$), putting the element $bc - ac$ and its negative $ac - bc$ both in $P$, which trichotomy forbids; hence $a < b$: this completes claim 4. [assume-hyp, step 2.3, L4, L1, algebra]

4.1 Conversely, assume $c < 0$ and $bc < ac$; by trichotomy exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds. If $a = b$ then $ac = bc$, contradicting $bc < ac$; if $b < a$ then the argument of step 2.4 applied to the pair $b < a$ gives $ac < bc$, so $ac - bc \in P$ (from $bc < ac$) while $bc - ac \in P$ (from $ac < bc$), putting the element $ac - bc$ and its negative $bc - ac$ both in $P$, which trichotomy forbids; hence $a < b$: this completes claim 5.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field. If $0 < a < b$ and $0 < c < d$ then $ac < bd$. If $0 \le a \le b$ and $0 \le c \le d$ then $ac \le bd$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Elements $a, b, c, d$ of an ordered field $F$.

[L1] For a positive multiplier $c > 0$: $x < y \iff xc < yc$; multiplying a strict inequality by a positive element preserves it ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

[L2] For $c \ge 0$: $x \le y \Rightarrow xc \le yc$; the case $c > 0$ is [L1] and the case $c = 0$ gives $0 \le 0$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

[L3] The order is transitive: if $x < y$ and $y < z$ then $x < z$, and likewise for $\le$, since the positive cone is closed under addition ([[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $0 < a < b$ and $0 < c < d$; since $c > 0$, scaling $a < b$ by $c$ gives $ac < bc$. [L1]

1.2 Since $b > 0$ (from $0 < a < b$), scaling $c < d$ by $b$ gives $bc < bd$. [L1]

1.3 Assume instead $0 \le a \le b$ and $0 \le c \le d$; since $c \ge 0$, from $a \le b$ we get $ac \le bc$. [L2]

1.4 Since $b \ge 0$ (from $0 \le a \le b$), from $c \le d$ we get $bc \le bd$. [L2]

2.1 By transitivity, $ac < bc < bd$, hence $ac < bd$, proving the strict claim. [L3, step 1.1, step 1.2]

2.2 By transitivity of $\le$, $ac \le bc \le bd$, hence $ac \le bd$, proving the nonstrict claim. [L3, step 1.3, step 1.4]

3.1 Both the strict and the nonstrict inequalities hold. [step 2.1, step 2.2] ∎

## Statement

The relation $\le$ on $\mathbb{N}$, where $m \le n \iff \exists k\ (m + k = n)$ ([[def-nat-order]]), is a linear (total) order: reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive, and total.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The order $m \le n \iff \exists k\ (m + k = n)$ ([[def-nat-order]]) and addition with $m + 0 = m$, $m + \sigma(n) = \sigma(m + n)$ ([[def-nat-addition]]).

[L1] $0 + k = k$ and addition is associative ([[lem-nat-add-identity]], [[lem-nat-add-associative]]).

[L2] Cancellation: $m + k = n + k \Rightarrow m = n$ ([[lem-nat-add-cancellative]]).

[L3] Every nonzero natural is a successor: if $j \ne 0$ then $j = \sigma(i)$ for some $i$ ([[lem-nat-nonzero-is-successor]]).

[L4] Trichotomy: exactly one of $m < n$, $m = n$, $m > n$ holds ([[lem-nat-trichotomy]]).

[L5] Addition is commutative ([[lem-nat-add-commutative]]).

[L6] $\sigma(x) \ne 0$ for every $x$ (Peano axiom P1) ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Reflexive: $m + 0 = m$, so $m \le m$. [given]

1.2 Transitive: if $m \le n$ and $n \le p$, say $m + k = n$ and $n + j = p$, then $m + (k + j) = (m + k) + j = n + j = p$, so $m \le p$. [given, L1]

1.3 A sum is zero only if both summands are: if $k + j = 0$ with $j \ne 0$ then $j = \sigma(i)$ and $k + j = k + \sigma(i) = \sigma(k + i) \ne 0$ [L6], a contradiction, so $k = j = 0$. [L1, L3, L6]

1.4 Total: by trichotomy one of $m < n$, $m = n$, $m > n$ holds, and each of these gives $m \le n$ or $n \le m$. [L4]

2.1 Antisymmetric: if $m \le n$ and $n \le m$, say $m + k = n$ and $n + j = m$, then $m + (k + j) = (m + k) + j = n + j = m = m + 0$; commuting both sides [L5] gives $(k + j) + m = 0 + m$, and cancelling the common right summand $m$ [L2] gives $k + j = 0$, hence $k = j = 0$ by step 1.3 and $m = n$. [given, L1, L2, L5, step 1.3]

3.1 Reflexivity, antisymmetry, transitivity, and totality all hold, so $\le$ is a linear order on $\mathbb{N}$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.1, step 1.4] ∎

## Statement

Every complete ordered field $F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) is Archimedean:
for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$,
where $n \cdot 1_F$ is the canonical natural of the ordered field $F$
([[def-ordered-field]]). Equivalently, the canonical naturals are cofinal in $F$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $F$; write $A = \{\, n \cdot 1_F : n \ge 1 \,\}$ for the set of its canonical naturals.

[L1] Least-upper-bound property: every nonempty $S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound $\sup S \in F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Each canonical natural satisfies $n \cdot 1_F > 0$, one has $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L3] $0 < 1_F$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $F$ is not Archimedean: there is some $x \in F$ with $n \cdot 1_F \le x$ for all $n \ge 1$, that is, $x$ is an upper bound of $A$. [assume-contra]

2.1 The set $A$ is nonempty, since $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F \in A$, and it is bounded above by $x$. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 By the least-upper-bound property, $A$ has a least upper bound $s = \sup A \in F$. [step 2.1, L1]

4.1 Since $1_F > 0$, we have $s - 1_F < s$; as $s$ is the least upper bound, $s - 1_F$ is not an upper bound of $A$. [step 3.1, L3]

5.1 Hence there is some $m \ge 1$ with $m \cdot 1_F > s - 1_F$. [step 4.1]

6.1 Adding $1_F$ to both sides, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F > s$. [step 5.1, L2]

7.1 But $(m+1) \cdot 1_F \in A$, so $(m+1) \cdot 1_F \le s$ because $s$ is an upper bound of $A$, contradicting 6.1. [step 6.1, step 3.1, L2]

8.1 The assumption is therefore untenable, so $F$ is Archimedean. [step 7.1, discharge-contradiction] ∎
