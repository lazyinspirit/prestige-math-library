## Statement

Write $-A := \{-a : a \in A\}$ for $A \subseteq \overline{\mathbb{R}}$, with the
reflection of [[def-extended-reals]], which fixes no point of
$\{-\infty, +\infty\}$ but exchanges the two.

1. **Reflection exchanges the extended bounds.** For every
   $A \subseteq \overline{\mathbb{R}}$,
   $$\sup(-A) = -\inf A \qquad \text{and} \qquad \inf(-A) = -\sup A,$$
   with the bounds of [[lem-extended-reals-complete]] and no hypothesis on $A$.
2. **Reflection exchanges $\limsup$ and $\liminf$.** For every sequence $(x_k)$
   of reals ([[def-sequence]]),
   $$\limsup_{k}(-x_k) = -\liminf_{k} x_k \qquad \text{and} \qquad \liminf_{k}(-x_k) = -\limsup_{k} x_k,$$
   with $\limsup$ and $\liminf$ as in [[def-limsup-liminf]].

Claim 2 is what turns every statement about $\limsup$ on this page into its dual
about $\liminf$ without a second proof, exactly as the identity
$\inf S = -\sup(-S)$ does in $\mathbb{R}$. The novelty is only that the reflection
now has to move the two new points, and it does: $-(+\infty) = -\infty$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals, the reflected sequence $y_k := -x_k$, and for $A \subseteq \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ the reflected set $-A = \{-a : a \in A\}$.

[L1] Reflection on $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$: the map $a \mapsto -a$ satisfies $-(-a) = a$ and $a \le b$ if and only if $-b \le -a$, for all $a, b \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-extended-reals]]).

[L2] Every subset of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ has a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, with no hypothesis on the subset ([[lem-extended-reals-complete]]).

[L3] Least upper bound and greatest lower bound in a poset, and their uniqueness ([[def-upper-bound]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L4] Tail ranges $T_n = \{x_k : k \ge n\}$, the extended tail bounds $s_n = \sup T_n$ and $i_n = \inf T_n$, and $\limsup_k x_k = \inf\{s_n\}$, $\liminf_k x_k = \sup\{i_n\}$ ([[def-limsup-liminf]]).

[L5] All four families exist for every sequence ([[lem-limsup-exists]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $A \subseteq \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ be arbitrary. Since $-(-a) = a$ for every $a$, the map $a \mapsto -a$ carries $A$ onto $-A$ and $-A$ onto $A$, so $-(-A) = A$; and by [L2] each of $\sup A$, $\inf A$, $\sup(-A)$, $\inf(-A)$ exists. [given, L1, L2]

1.2 Let $T_n$ and $T'_n$ be the tail ranges of $(x_k)$ and of $(y_k) = (-x_k)$. Since $y_k = -x_k$, the set $T'_n = \{y_k : k \ge n\}$ is exactly $-T_n$. [given, L4]

2.1 The element $-\inf A$ is an upper bound of $-A$: for $a \in A$ we have $\inf A \le a$, hence $-a \le -\inf A$ by [L1], and every element of $-A$ is such a $-a$. If $v$ is any upper bound of $-A$, then for $a \in A$ we get $-a \le v$, hence $-v \le a$ by [L1], so $-v$ is a lower bound of $A$ and therefore $-v \le \inf A$, which gives $-\inf A \le v$ by [L1] again. So $-\inf A$ is the least upper bound of $-A$, that is $\sup(-A) = -\inf A$. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L3]

3.1 Applying the identity just proved to the set $-A$ in place of $A$, and using $-(-A) = A$, gives $\sup A = -\inf(-A)$; reflecting both sides and using $-(-a) = a$ yields $\inf(-A) = -\sup A$. Claim 1 is proved. [step 2.1, step 1.1, L1]

4.1 By claim 1 applied to $T_n$, the $n$-th tail supremum of $(y_k)$ is $\sup T'_n = \sup(-T_n) = -i_n$, and its $n$-th tail infimum is $\inf(-T_n) = -s_n$. [step 1.2, step 2.1, step 3.1, L4]

5.1 Hence the family of tail suprema of $(y_k)$ is $\{-i_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\} = -\{i_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$, so claim 1 applied to $\{i_n\}$ gives $\limsup_k(-x_k) = \inf\big(-\{i_n\}\big) = -\sup\{i_n\} = -\liminf_k x_k$. [step 4.1, step 3.1, L4, L5]

6.1 The same identity applied to the sequence $(y_k)$, whose reflection is $(-y_k) = (x_k)$ by [L1], reads $\limsup_k x_k = -\liminf_k(-x_k)$; reflecting both sides gives $\liminf_k(-x_k) = -\limsup_k x_k$. Both parts of claim 2 are proved. [step 5.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Claim 1 needs no hypothesis, and that is the whole gain over $\mathbb{R}$.**
  The corresponding real statement, $\inf S = -\sup(-S)$
  ([[thm-infimum-property]]), carries the hypotheses that $S$ be nonempty and
  bounded below, because otherwise neither side denotes anything. Here both sides
  always denote, so the identity is unconditional and can be applied to the family
  $\{i_n\}$ without first checking that it is bounded, which for an unbounded
  sequence it is not.

- **The reflection is an order anti-isomorphism, not merely a bijection.** What
  step 2.1 uses is that $a \mapsto -a$ is a bijection *and* reverses the order,
  both recorded in [[def-extended-reals]]. A bijection alone would not exchange
  bounds, and an order-reversing map that is not injective would not carry least
  upper bounds to greatest lower bounds.

- **Consequences on this page.** [[cor-liminf-is-least-subsequential-limit]] is
  [[thm-limsup-is-greatest-subsequential-limit]] read through this lemma, the
  $\liminf$ half of [[thm-limsup-subadditive]] is its $\limsup$ half read the same
  way, and the $-\infty$ case of
  [[thm-convergence-iff-limsup-equals-liminf]] is its $+\infty$ case.

If $a = -\\infty$ then\n  $b \\le a$ forces $b = -\\infty$, since the clause $a = +\\infty$ fails and $b, a$\n  are not both real. Symmetrically $b = -\\infty$ forces $a = -\\infty$, and\n  $a = +\\infty$ or $b = +\\infty$ forces the other to be $+\\infty$. In the one\n  remaining situation $a$ and $b$ are both real and antisymmetry is that of\n  $\\mathbb{R}$.\n- *Transitive.* Let $a \\le b \\le c$. If $a = -\\infty$ or $c = +\\infty$ the\n  conclusion is one of the first two clauses. Otherwise $a \\ne -\\infty$ forces,\n  in $a \\le b$, either $b = +\\infty$ or $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$; and $c \\ne +\\infty$\n  forces, in $b \\le c$, either $b = -\\infty$ or $b, c \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The value\n  $b = +\\infty$ is incompatible with the second alternative pair, so $b$ is real,\n  hence so are $a$ and $c$, and transitivity is that of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n- *Total.* If $a = -\\infty$ or $b = +\\infty$ then $a \\le b$; if $b = -\\infty$ or\n  $a = +\\infty$ then $b \\le a$; otherwise both are real and the order of\n  $\\mathbb{R}$ is total.\n- *Preserved and reflected.* For $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ the first two clauses fail,\n  so $a \\le b$ in $\\overline{\\mathbb{R}}$ says exactly $a \\le b$ in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nIn particular $-\\infty$ is the least and $+\\infty$ the greatest element of\n$\\overline{\\mathbb{R}}$, and $-\\infty < x < +\\infty$ for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Reflection.** Extend negation by\n\n$$-(+\\infty) := -\\infty, \\qquad -(-\\infty) := +\\infty,$$\n\nkeeping the field negative on $\\mathbb{R}$. The resulting map\n$\\nu : \\overline{\\mathbb{R}} \\to \\overline{\\mathbb{R}}$, $\\nu(a) = -a$, satisfies\n$\\nu(\\nu(a)) = a$ and\n\n$$a \\le b \\iff -b \\le -a \\qquad (a, b \\in \\overline{\\mathbb{R}}).$$\n\nFor $a$ and $b$ real this is the elementwise order reversal in $\\mathbb{R}$:\ntranslation invariance ([[lem-of-add-order]]) applied with the constant $-a-b$\nturns $a < b$ into $-b < -a$ and, applied with the constant $a+b$, turns it back,\nwhile $a = b$ holds exactly when $-a = -b$. In every other case both sides are\ndecided by the first two clauses of the order: $a = -\\infty$ makes both sides\ntrue, as does $b = +\\infty$, and if $a \\ne -\\infty$, $b \\ne +\\infty$ and $a, b$\nare not both real then one of $a = +\\infty$, $b = -\\infty$ holds and both sides\nare false.\n\n**Partial addition.** For $a, b \\in \\overline{\\mathbb{R}}$ the sum $a + b$ is\ndefined by\n\n- $a + b$ = the field sum, when $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$;\n- $a + b := +\\infty$ when $a = +\\infty$ and $b \\ne -\\infty$, or $b = +\\infty$ and $a \\ne -\\infty$;\n- $a + b := -\\infty$ when $a = -\\infty$ and $b \\ne +\\infty$, or $b = -\\infty$ and $a \\ne +\\infty$;\n\nand **the two sums $(+\\infty) + (-\\infty)$ and $(-\\infty) + (+\\infty)$ are left\nundefined**.

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]). Then
$\liminf_{k} x_k \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$ and
$\liminf_{k} x_k \le L$ for every $L \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$
([[def-limsup-liminf]], [[def-extended-limits]]).

So the extended subsequential limit set of any real sequence has a **least**
element as well as a greatest one, and the two are
$\liminf_k x_k$ and $\limsup_k x_k$ respectively
([[thm-limsup-is-greatest-subsequential-limit]]). Every extended subsequential
limit lies between them.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals, and its reflection $y_k := -x_k$.

[L1] Reflection on $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$: $a \mapsto -a$ satisfies $-(-a) = a$ and $a \le b$ if and only if $-b \le -a$ ([[def-extended-reals]]).

[L2] $\limsup_k(-x_k) = -\liminf_k x_k$ ([[lem-limsup-reflection]]).

[L3] For every real sequence the extended subsequential limit set is nonempty and has greatest element the limit superior ([[thm-limsup-is-greatest-subsequential-limit]]).

[L4] Convergence in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, subsequences and the set $\overline{\operatorname{SL}}$ ([[def-extended-limits]], [[def-subsequential-limit]], [[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L5] Scalar multiples of convergent sequences: $z_j \to z$ in $\mathbb{R}$ implies $c z_j \to c z$ ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]]).

[L6] Divergence to $\pm\infty$, and order reversal: $z_j > M$ is equivalent to $-z_j < -M$, and $M$ runs over all reals exactly when $-M$ does ([[def-divergence-to-infinity]], [[lem-of-add-order]]).

[L7] Limit superior and limit inferior of a real sequence ([[def-limsup-liminf]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Put $y_k := -x_k$, a sequence of reals; then $-y_k = x_k$ for every $k$, by the involution property of the reflection. [given, L1, L4]

1.2 Let $L \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ and let $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ be strictly increasing with $(x_{n_j})$ converging to $L$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$. [given, L4]

1.3 By [L3] applied to the sequence $(y_k)$, the set $\overline{\operatorname{SL}}(y)$ is nonempty and has greatest element $N_0 := \limsup_k y_k$, and $N_0 = -\liminf_k x_k$ by [L2]. [given, L2, L3, L7]

2.1 The reflected subsequence $(y_{n_j}) = (-x_{n_j})$ converges to $-L$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$. If $L$ is real this is the scalar rule with $c = -1$. If $L = +\infty$ then for every real $M$ there is $J$ with $x_{n_j} > M$ for all $j \ge J$, hence $y_{n_j} < -M$ for all such $j$; since $-M$ runs over all reals as $M$ does, $y_{n_j} \to -\infty = -L$. If $L = -\infty$ the same argument with the inequalities exchanged gives $y_{n_j} \to +\infty = -L$. [step 1.2, L1, L4, L5, L6]

3.1 Hence $L \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$ implies $-L \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(y)$, the same index map serving. Applying that implication to the sequence $(y_k)$, whose reflection is $(x_k)$, gives conversely that $N \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(y)$ implies $-N \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$. So $\overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x) = \{\, -N : N \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(y) \,\}$. [step 2.1, step 1.1, L1, L4]

4.1 Therefore $-N_0 \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$, and $-N_0 = -(-\liminf_k x_k) = \liminf_k x_k$; and for any $L \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$ the element $-L$ lies in $\overline{\operatorname{SL}}(y)$, so $-L \le N_0$ by maximality, whence $\liminf_k x_k = -N_0 \le L$ by order reversal. Thus $\liminf_k x_k$ is the least element of $\overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$. [step 3.1, step 1.3, L1, L2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Nothing is reconstructed.** The subsequence realising $\liminf_k x_k$ is the
  one produced by [[thm-limsup-is-greatest-subsequential-limit]] for the reflected
  sequence, read back through $y \mapsto -y$. That is the whole point of proving
  [[lem-limsup-reflection]] first: the recursion and the well-ordering argument
  are done once.

- **Combined with the greatest element, this brackets every subsequential
  limit.** For any real sequence and any $L \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$,
  $$\liminf_{k} x_k \;\le\; L \;\le\; \limsup_{k} x_k,$$
  which contains [[lem-liminf-le-limsup]] as the special case obtained by taking
  for $L$ either endpoint, both of which are in the set.

- **The real subsequential limit set inherits the statement only when the value is
  finite.** If $\liminf_k x_k$ is a real number it is the least element of
  $\operatorname{SL}(x)$ as well, since the two sets agree on $\mathbb{R}$
  ([[def-extended-limits]]). If it is $-\infty$, then $\operatorname{SL}(x)$ may
  have no least element at all, or be empty.

## Definition

Fix two objects $-\infty$ and $+\infty$, distinct from one another and neither of
them a real number ([[def-real-numbers]]), and set

$$\overline{\mathbb{R}} := \mathbb{R} \cup \{-\infty, +\infty\}.$$

This is a **new object**, introduced here explicitly with its own order and its
own partial arithmetic. It is not an enlargement of the field $\mathbb{R}$, and
no operation of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) is redefined by
anything below.

**The order.** For $a, b \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ declare

$$a \le b \quad :\Longleftrightarrow \quad a = -\infty \ \text{ or } \ b = +\infty \ \text{ or } \ \big(a, b \in \mathbb{R} \text{ and } a \le b \text{ in } \mathbb{R}\big),$$

with $\mathbb{R}$ ordered as in [[def-real-order]], and write $a < b$ for
"$a \le b$ and $a \ne b$" as usual ([[def-partial-order]]).

**$(\overline{\mathbb{R}}, \le)$ is a totally ordered set, and the inclusion of
$\mathbb{R}$ preserves and reflects the order.** All four checks are immediate
from the displayed clauses.

- *Reflexive.* For $a = \pm\infty$ one of the first two clauses applies; for
  $a \in \mathbb{R}$ the third does, since $a \le a$ in $\mathbb{R}$.
- *Antisymmetric.* Suppose $a \le b$ and $b \le a$. If $a = -\infty$ then
  $b \le a$ forces $b = -\infty$, since the clause $a = +\infty$ fails and $b, a$
  are not both real. Symmetrically $b = -\infty$ forces $a = -\infty$, and
  $a = +\infty$ or $b = +\infty$ forces the other to be $+\infty$. In the one
  remaining situation $a$ and $b$ are both real and antisymmetry is that of
  $\mathbb{R}$.
- *Transitive.* Let $a \le b \le c$. If $a = -\infty$ or $c = +\infty$ the
  conclusion is one of the first two clauses. Otherwise $a \ne -\infty$ forces,
  in $a \le b$, either $b = +\infty$ or $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$; and $c \ne +\infty$
  forces, in $b \le c$, either $b = -\infty$ or $b, c \in \mathbb{R}$. The value
  $b = +\infty$ is incompatible with the second alternative pair, so $b$ is real,
  hence so are $a$ and $c$, and transitivity is that of $\mathbb{R}$.
- *Total.* If $a = -\infty$ or $b = +\infty$ then $a \le b$; if $b = -\infty$ or
  $a = +\infty$ then $b \le a$; otherwise both are real and the order of
  $\mathbb{R}$ is total.
- *Preserved and reflected.* For $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ the first two clauses fail,
  so $a \le b$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ says exactly $a \le b$ in $\mathbb{R}$.

In particular $-\infty$ is the least and $+\infty$ the greatest element of
$\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, and $-\infty < x < +\infty$ for every $x \in \mathbb{R}$.

**Reflection.** Extend negation by

$$-(+\infty) := -\infty, \qquad -(-\infty) := +\infty,$$

keeping the field negative on $\mathbb{R}$. The resulting map
$\nu : \overline{\mathbb{R}} \to \overline{\mathbb{R}}$, $\nu(a) = -a$, satisfies
$\nu(\nu(a)) = a$ and

$$a \le b \iff -b \le -a \qquad (a, b \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}).$$

For $a$ and $b$ real this is the elementwise order reversal in $\mathbb{R}$:
translation invariance ([[lem-of-add-order]]) applied with the constant $-a-b$
turns $a < b$ into $-b < -a$ and, applied with the constant $a+b$, turns it back,
while $a = b$ holds exactly when $-a = -b$. In every other case both sides are
decided by the first two clauses of the order: $a = -\infty$ makes both sides
true, as does $b = +\infty$, and if $a \ne -\infty$, $b \ne +\infty$ and $a, b$
are not both real then one of $a = +\infty$, $b = -\infty$ holds and both sides
are false.

**Partial addition.** For $a, b \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ the sum $a + b$ is
defined by

- $a + b$ = the field sum, when $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$;
- $a + b := +\infty$ when $a = +\infty$ and $b \ne -\infty$, or $b = +\infty$ and $a \ne -\infty$;
- $a + b := -\infty$ when $a = -\infty$ and $b \ne +\infty$, or $b = -\infty$ and $a \ne +\infty$;

and **the two sums $(+\infty) + (-\infty)$ and $(-\infty) + (+\infty)$ are left
undefined**. Addition is commutative where defined, and

$$-(a + b) = (-a) + (-b),$$

each side being defined exactly when the other is: the excluded pairs
$\{+\infty, -\infty\}$ are exchanged by $\nu$, and the three clauses above are
exchanged accordingly.

**Partial multiplication.** For $a, b \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ the product $ab$
is defined by

- $ab$ = the field product, when $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$;
- $ab := +\infty$ when one of $a, b$ is $\pm\infty$, the other is $\ne 0$, and both are $> 0$ or both are $< 0$;
- $ab := -\infty$ when one of $a, b$ is $\pm\infty$, the other is $\ne 0$, and one is $> 0$ and the other $< 0$;

and **every product with one factor $0$ and the other $\pm\infty$ is left
undefined**. The comparisons $> 0$ and $< 0$ here are taken in the order above,
under which $+\infty > 0 > -\infty$.

**Nothing else is defined.** There is no subtraction, no division, no
exponentiation and no absolute value on $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ in this library;
where such an expression is wanted it is written out in the two defined
operations, and where a case falls in the undefined list the statement carries an
explicit hypothesis saying so.

## Remarks

- **$\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is not a field, and not an ordered field.** It has no
  additive inverse for $+\infty$: $(+\infty) + b$ is $+\infty$ whenever it is
  defined and is never $0$. So none of the field axioms
  ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) is available here, and no algebraic
  manipulation valid in $\mathbb{R}$ may be transported to
  $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ without a separate justification.

- **Why the excluded cases are excluded.** The three defined clauses of each
  operation are exactly the cases in which the value is forced by the limiting
  behaviour of the sequences involved, and the excluded cases are exactly the
  ones in which it is not. For the product this is proved on the companion page:
  [[cex-zero-times-infinity-indeterminate]] exhibits a null sequence and two
  sequences diverging to $+\infty$ whose products behave differently, so no value
  assigned to $0 \cdot (+\infty)$ could be compatible with products of limits.
  The same phenomenon rules out a value for $(+\infty) + (-\infty)$: with
  $a_k = k$ and $b_k = -k$ the sum is constantly $0$, while with $b_k = -2k$ it
  diverges to $-\infty$. Leaving them undefined is not squeamishness, it is the
  only option that keeps every later statement about limits true without a
  side condition hidden inside the arithmetic.

- **This is the separate introduction that [[rem-sup-conventions]] points to.**
  That remark refuses the conventions $\sup S = +\infty$ and
  $\inf \emptyset = +\infty$ inside $\mathbb{R}$, and records that the extended
  real line is introduced explicitly here, with its own order and its own partial
  arithmetic kept separate from $\mathbb{R}$ rather than quietly extending it.
  This is that introduction. The suprema and infima of [[def-complete-ordered-field]],
  [[def-infimum]] and the whole suprema page remain real numbers with their
  nonempty and bounded hypotheses intact; what is new is a *separate* supremum
  operation, taken in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ and named as such, supplied by
  [[lem-extended-reals-complete]].

- **The symbols were already in circulation, and this definition does not change
  what they meant.** [[def-divergence-to-infinity]] defines the single phrase
  "$x_k \to +\infty$" as an abbreviation for a condition on $(x_k)$, and says in
  as many words that it does not define an object named $+\infty$. That reading
  is still correct: nothing in [[def-divergence-to-infinity]] is restated or
  reinterpreted here, and [[def-extended-limits]] is where the two are related, by
  a definition that quotes the old one rather than replacing it. Likewise the
  interval notation $(a, \infty)$ of [[def-interval]] is notation for a condition
  on one side, not an endpoint, and stays that way.

## Definition

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]). For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ let

$$T_n \;:=\; \{\, x_k : k \in \mathbb{N},\ k \ge n \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$$

be the **$n$-th tail range** of $(x_k)$, a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ since
$x_n \in T_n$. Regard $T_n$ as a subset of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$
([[def-extended-reals]]) and put

$$s_n \;:=\; \sup T_n \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}, \qquad i_n \;:=\; \inf T_n \in \overline{\mathbb{R}},$$

the supremum and infimum taken in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, which exist for every
$n$ and for every sequence by [[lem-extended-reals-complete]]. The **limit
superior** and **limit inferior** of $(x_k)$ are then

$$\limsup_{k} x_k \;:=\; \inf \{\, s_n : n \in \mathbb{N} \,\}, \qquad \liminf_{k} x_k \;:=\; \sup \{\, i_n : n \in \mathbb{N} \,\},$$

again taken in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ and again existing by
[[lem-extended-reals-complete]], since $\{s_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ and
$\{i_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ are subsets of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ on which no
hypothesis is needed. Both are elements of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, and either may
be $+\infty$ or $-\infty$. The notations $\limsup_{k \to \infty} x_k$,
$\varlimsup_k x_k$ and $\overline{\lim}_k x_k$ all denote the first of them
elsewhere; this library writes $\limsup_k x_k$.

**Every quantity written here exists, and that is why the extended line was
introduced.** Each of the four operations above is an application of
[[lem-extended-reals-complete]] to a subset of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ carrying no
hypothesis whatever. Written with the real supremum of
[[def-complete-ordered-field]] and the real infimum of [[thm-infimum-property]]
instead, the definition would be available only for sequences that are bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]): $\sup T_n$ needs $T_n$ bounded above, and
$\inf\{s_n\}$ needs $\{s_n\}$ nonempty, bounded below, and made of real numbers
([[def-infimum]]). None of those is automatic, and the discipline recorded in
[[rem-sup-conventions]] forbids papering over the gap with a convention. The
extended supremum is a different operation in a different ordered set, and it is
total.

**Values, when the sequence is bounded.** If $(x_k)$ is bounded, say
$|x_k| \le M$ for every $k$, then each $T_n$ is a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$
bounded above by $M$ and below by $-M$, so by the agreement clause of
[[lem-extended-reals-complete]] each $s_n$ and each $i_n$ is the *real* supremum
or infimum of $T_n$, and lies in $[-M, M]$. The family $\{s_n\}$ is then a
nonempty set of reals bounded below by $-M$, so $\limsup_k x_k$ is likewise the
real infimum of $\{s_n\}$ and lies in $[-M, M]$; dually for $\liminf_k x_k$. So
for a bounded sequence both quantities are ordinary real numbers computed with
the ordinary real supremum and infimum, and the extended line is doing no work.
It is only for unbounded sequences that the values $\pm\infty$ occur.

## Remarks

- **The order of the two operations is not symmetric and must be kept straight.**
  $\limsup$ is an infimum of suprema and $\liminf$ a supremum of infima. Taking
  them in the other order gives $\sup_n \sup_{k \ge n} x_k = \sup_k x_k$ and
  $\inf_n \inf_{k \ge n} x_k = \inf_k x_k$, which are the extreme values of the
  whole sequence and carry no information about its behaviour at large indices.
  The point of the definition is that the inner operation looks at a tail and the
  outer one lets the tail recede.

- **Why tails at all.** Each $s_n$ is a bound on the whole tail from index $n$ on,
  so it forgets the first $n$ terms; letting $n$ grow forgets any fixed finite
  number of them. That is what makes $\limsup$ and $\liminf$ tail quantities in
  the sense of [[lem-limit-of-tail]], and it is the reason they can characterise
  convergence, which is itself a tail property.

- **Neither quantity is a limit, and neither is claimed to be one.** The symbols
  $\limsup$ and $\liminf$ are single pieces of notation for the two displayed
  expressions, exactly as "$x_k \to +\infty$" is a single abbreviation in
  [[def-divergence-to-infinity]]. That the family $(s_n)$ does decrease to
  $\limsup_k x_k$ in a precise sense is a theorem, not part of this definition;
  the monotonicity half is [[lem-limsup-exists]].

- **The tail ranges are sets, not sequences.** $T_n$ is the range of the $n$-th
  tail, so repetitions and order are forgotten ([[def-sequence]]). That is
  harmless here, since a supremum depends only on the set of values, and it is
  what lets the whole definition be phrased with the order-theoretic operations of
  [[lem-extended-reals-complete]] and nothing else.

## Definition

Let $P$ be a set. A **partial order** on $P$ is a binary relation $\le$ on $P$
such that, for all $x, y, z \in P$:

- **(R)** *reflexivity*: $x \le x$;
- **(A)** *antisymmetry*: if $x \le y$ and $y \le x$, then $x = y$;
- **(T)** *transitivity*: if $x \le y$ and $y \le z$, then $x \le z$.

The pair $(P, \le)$ is a **partially ordered set**, abbreviated **poset**. When
the order is clear we write $P$ for the pair.

The associated **strict order** is defined by
$$x < y \quad :\Longleftrightarrow \quad x \le y \text{ and } x \ne y.$$

Two elements $x, y \in P$ are **comparable** if $x \le y$ or $y \le x$, and
**incomparable** otherwise. A partial order in which every two elements are
comparable is a **total order** (equivalently a **linear order**), and $(P, \le)$
is then a **totally ordered set**.

## Remarks

- Partiality is the whole point: a partial order is permitted to leave pairs
  incomparable, which is what makes maximal elements and chains worth
  distinguishing at all. In a total order every subset is a chain, and a maximal
  element is automatically the greatest element.
- All three axioms are used essentially in the proofs that rest on this
  definition: reflexivity in [[lem-extremal-cut-closed-under-f]] and
  [[lem-successor-of-extremal]],
  transitivity almost everywhere, and antisymmetry in [[thm-bourbaki-witt]],
  where the fixed point is obtained by passing from $f(c) \le c$ and
  $c \le f(c)$ to $f(c) = c$. Antisymmetry is also what makes a least upper
  bound unique when it exists, and uniqueness is what licenses the functional
  notation $\sup$ used in [[def-chain-complete-poset]].
- Dropping antisymmetry gives a **preorder**. Preorders are genuinely useful
  elsewhere (a directed set is preordered).
- Inclusion $\subseteq$ on the power set of any set is the standard example, and
  it is the order that appears concretely in [[thm-zorn]], which applies
  [[thm-bourbaki-witt]] to the set of chains of $P$ ordered by inclusion, and in
  [[thm-zorn-implies-ac]], which applies Zorn's lemma to partial choice
  functions ordered by extension, an inclusion order on their graphs. The
  results themselves are stated for an *arbitrary* poset and are used that way:
  [[thm-zorn]] is applied to whatever poset a later page brings, and the
  refutation in
  [[fs-maximal-is-greatest]] runs in a bare two-element antichain that is not
  presented as an order by inclusion at all.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]],
[[def-real-numbers]]) with its order and absolute value ([[def-real-order]]), and
$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers with its order ([[def-natural-numbers]],
[[def-nat-order]]).

A **sequence of reals** is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$. We write
$x_k$ for the value $x(k)$, call it the **$k$-th term**, and write $(x_k)$, or
$(x_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$, for the function itself. The **range** of $(x_k)$ is
the subset $\{\, x_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals and let $P$ be a property of indices.

- $(x_k)$ is **bounded** if there is $M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for
  every $k \in \mathbb{N}$; it is **unbounded** otherwise.
- $P$ holds **eventually** if there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $P(k)$ holds
  for every $k \ge K$.
- $P$ holds **frequently** if for every $K \in \mathbb{N}$ there is some
  $k \ge K$ for which $P(k)$ holds.
- For $K \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$K$-th tail** of $(x_k)$ is the sequence
  $x^{(K)}$ defined by $x^{(K)}_j := x_{j + K}$ for $j \in \mathbb{N}$; it is
  again a sequence of reals.
- A function $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is **strictly increasing** if
  $n_j < n_k$ whenever $j < k$. For such an $n$, the **subsequence** of $(x_k)$
  along $n$ is the composite $x \circ n$, written $(x_{n_k})_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$;
  it is again a sequence of reals.

**Convergence and Cauchyness are not defined here.** They are already fixed, for
sequences of reals, by the published [[def-real-limit]]: $(x_k)$ *converges* to
$x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is
$K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$, and $(x_k)$
is *Cauchy* when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$
with $|x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$. This page builds the
toolkit for those two notions and does not restate them. A sequence
**converges** if it converges to some real, and **diverges** if it does not.

## Remarks

- **Identification of $\mathbb{Q}$ with its image.** The map $q \mapsto \hat q$
  is an embedding of ordered fields ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and as is
  standard we write $q$ for $\hat q$, so that a rational may be compared with a
  real without further comment. [[def-real-limit]] is stated with the hat; every
  rational $\varepsilon$ occurring on this page is its image under this
  embedding.

- **Rational and real $\varepsilon$ agree.** [[def-real-limit]] tests convergence
  against every *rational* $\varepsilon > 0$, and its own remark records that
  this loses nothing. Spelled out: suppose that for every rational
  $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all
  $k \ge K$, and let $\eta > 0$ be an arbitrary *real*. Since $0 < \eta$,
  density of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) supplies a
  rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, and the index $K$
  belonging to that $\varepsilon$ satisfies $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon < \eta$ for
  all $k \ge K$. The converse implication is immediate, since every positive
  rational is a positive real. So the two formulations define the same relation,
  and the same two lines apply verbatim to the Cauchy condition and to any
  condition of the shape "for every $\varepsilon > 0$, eventually
  $\cdots < \varepsilon$". Proofs on this page therefore run the test with a real
  $\varepsilon$ wherever that is more convenient, and say so by citing this
  remark; nothing is smuggled in.

- **Constant sequences converge.** For $c \in \mathbb{R}$ the constant sequence
  $x_k := c$ converges to $c$, because $|x_k - c| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ for
  every $\varepsilon > 0$ and every $k$; it is bounded by $|c|$.

- **Eventually and frequently are dual.** $P$ holds frequently exactly when
  $\lnot P$ does not hold eventually, and $P$ holds eventually exactly when
  $\lnot P$ does not hold frequently. So the two quantifier patterns are
  negations of one another applied to the complementary property, and there is no
  third pattern hiding between them.

- **A sequence is not its range.** $(x_k)$ is a function, not a set, and the
  range does not determine the function: the sequence $x_0 = 0$, $x_k = 1$ for
  $k \ge 1$ and the sequence $y_0 = y_1 = 0$, $y_k = 1$ for $k \ge 2$ have the
  same range $\{0, 1\}$, yet they differ at $k = 1$, so they are different
  sequences. Order and repetition are part of the data and the range forgets
  both. Boundedness, on the other hand, depends only on the range.

- **Indexing.** Sequences here start at $k = 0$ because $\mathbb{N}$ contains
  $0$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]). Texts that index from $1$ describe the same
  objects up to a shift, and the shift changes nothing about convergence, by
  [[lem-limit-of-tail]].

## Definition

Let $(P, \le)$ be a poset ([[def-partial-order]]) and $S \subseteq P$.

An element $u \in P$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \le u$ for every
$s \in S$.

An element $u \in P$ is a **least upper bound** (or **supremum**) of $S$ if $u$
is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le v$ for every upper bound $v$ of $S$. When it
exists we write $u = \sup S$.

An element $u \in P$ is a **strict upper bound** of $S$ if $s < u$ for every
$s \in S$.

## Remarks

- **A least upper bound is unique when it exists.** If $u$ and $u'$ are both
  least upper bounds of $S$ then each is an upper bound and each is below the
  other, so $u \le u'$ and $u' \le u$, whence $u = u'$ by antisymmetry
  ([[def-partial-order]]). This is what makes the notation $\sup S$ legitimate.
  Antisymmetry is not peculiar to this argument: the same two-inequality step
  gives uniqueness of a greatest element ([[def-maximal-element]]), and it is
  used essentially in [[thm-bourbaki-witt]], whose fixed point is obtained by
  passing from $f(c) \le c$ and $c \le f(c)$ to $f(c) = c$. Drop antisymmetry
  and it is the conclusion, not merely the notation, that goes: on two distinct
  elements each below the other, every subset still has a least upper bound, yet
  the map exchanging the two satisfies $x \le f(x)$ and has no fixed point.
- **Every element of $P$ is an upper bound of the empty set**, vacuously.
  Consequently $\sup \emptyset$, when it exists, is the least element of $P$.
- An upper bound of $S$ need not belong to $S$, and $S$ may have many upper
  bounds and no least one. In $\mathbb{Q}$ with its usual order, the set
  $\{q \in \mathbb{Q} : q^2 < 2\}$ has upper bounds but no least upper bound.
- In a poset, a strict upper bound is exactly an upper bound outside $S$. If
  $u$ is strict then $u\notin S$, since $u<u$ is impossible. Conversely, if
  $u$ is an upper bound and $u\notin S$, then every $s\in S$ satisfies
  $s\le u$ and $s\ne u$, hence $s<u$. This distinction from an arbitrary upper
  bound matters in [[thm-zorn]], where the argument must produce one outside
  the chain.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ be **any** subset of the extended real
line ([[def-extended-reals]]) and write $A_{\mathbb{R}} := A \cap \mathbb{R}$.
Then $A$ has a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound in
$\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-upper-bound]]), each unique, which we write
$\sup A$ and $\inf A$ with the ambient set always $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$.
Explicitly:

- $\sup A = +\infty$ if $+\infty \in A$, or if $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ is not bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$;
- $\sup A = -\infty$ if $+\infty \notin A$ and $A_{\mathbb{R}} = \emptyset$;
- $\sup A$ is the real supremum $\sup A_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) if $+\infty \notin A$ and $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ is nonempty and bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$;

and dually, with $-\infty$ and $+\infty$ exchanged and "above" replaced by
"below", for $\inf A$ ([[def-infimum]], [[thm-infimum-property]]).

**Agreement.** If $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and bounded above in
$\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-bounded-set]]) then $\sup A$ computed in
$\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is the real number $\sup A$ of
[[def-complete-ordered-field]]; if $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and
bounded below then $\inf A$ computed in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is the real
number $\inf A$ of [[thm-infimum-property]]. In particular the notation is
unambiguous on the sets for which the real supremum and infimum are defined, and
$\sup \emptyset = -\infty$, $\inf \emptyset = +\infty$ in
$\overline{\mathbb{R}}$.

**No hypothesis is placed on $A$.** This is exactly what the real supremum cannot
do, and it is why every $\limsup$ statement on this page holds for every sequence
rather than for bounded ones only. It is also not a weakening of the discipline
this library keeps around suprema: the operation supplied here is a *different*
operation, taken in a *different* ordered set, and the agreement clause records
exactly where the two coincide.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $A \subseteq \overline{\mathbb{R}}$, and its real part $A_{\mathbb{R}} := A \cap \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] $(\overline{\mathbb{R}}, \le)$ is a totally ordered set in which $-\infty$ is the least element and $+\infty$ the greatest, and whose order restricted to $\mathbb{R}$ is the order of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-extended-reals]], [[def-partial-order]], [[def-real-order]]).

[L2] Upper and lower bounds in a poset: $u$ is an upper bound of $A$ when $a \le u$ for all $a \in A$, and a least upper bound when moreover $u \le v$ for every upper bound $v$; dually for lower bounds and greatest lower bounds. Each is unique when it exists, by antisymmetry ([[def-upper-bound]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L3] Least-upper-bound property of $\mathbb{R}$: every nonempty $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$ has a real least upper bound $\sup S$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L4] Greatest-lower-bound property of $\mathbb{R}$: every nonempty $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ that is bounded below in $\mathbb{R}$ has a real greatest lower bound $\inf S$ ([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]).

[L5] Bounded above and bounded below in $\mathbb{R}$ mean the existence of a real upper, respectively lower, bound ([[def-bounded-set]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Case S1 for the supremum: $+\infty \in A$. [given, assume-case suptop]

1.2 Case S2 for the supremum: $+\infty \notin A$ and $A_{\mathbb{R}} = \emptyset$, so that every element of $A$ equals $-\infty$. [given, assume-case supbot]

1.3 Case S3 for the supremum: $+\infty \notin A$, $A_{\mathbb{R}} \ne \emptyset$, and $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ is bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$. [given, assume-case supfin]

1.4 Case S4 for the supremum: $+\infty \notin A$, $A_{\mathbb{R}} \ne \emptyset$, and $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ is not bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$. [given, assume-case supunb]

1.5 Case I1 for the infimum: $-\infty \in A$. [given, assume-case infbot]

1.6 Case I2 for the infimum: $-\infty \notin A$ and $A_{\mathbb{R}} = \emptyset$, so that every element of $A$ equals $+\infty$. [given, assume-case inftop]

1.7 Case I3 for the infimum: $-\infty \notin A$, $A_{\mathbb{R}} \ne \emptyset$, and $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ is bounded below in $\mathbb{R}$. [given, assume-case inffin]

1.8 Case I4 for the infimum: $-\infty \notin A$, $A_{\mathbb{R}} \ne \emptyset$, and $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ is not bounded below in $\mathbb{R}$. [given, assume-case infunb]

2.1 In case S1 the element $+\infty$ is an upper bound of $A$, being the greatest element of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$; and if $v$ is any upper bound of $A$ then $+\infty \in A$ gives $+\infty \le v$, whence $v = +\infty$ by antisymmetry. So $+\infty$ is the least upper bound of $A$. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.2 In case S2 every element of $A$ equals $-\infty$, so $-\infty$ is an upper bound of $A$ by reflexivity; and $-\infty \le v$ for every $v \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$, being the least element. So $-\infty$ is the least upper bound of $A$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.3 In case S3 the real number $\sigma := \sup A_{\mathbb{R}}$ exists, and it is an upper bound of $A$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$: an element of $A$ is either real, hence lies in $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ and satisfies $a \le \sigma$ in $\mathbb{R}$ and so in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, or equals $-\infty$, which is $\le \sigma$; the value $+\infty$ does not occur in $A$ in this case. [step 1.3, L1, L3]

2.4 In case S4 the element $+\infty$ is an upper bound of $A$; and if $v$ is an upper bound then $v \ne -\infty$, because fixing $a \in A_{\mathbb{R}}$, which is possible in this case, gives $a \le v$ with $a$ real and $-\infty$ is below no real, while $v$ real would make $v$ a real upper bound of $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ and contradict the case hypothesis. So $v = +\infty$, and $+\infty$ is the least upper bound of $A$. [step 1.4, L1, L2, L5]

2.5 In case I1 the element $-\infty$ is a lower bound of $A$, being least; and any lower bound $w$ satisfies $w \le -\infty$ because $-\infty \in A$, whence $w = -\infty$ by antisymmetry. So $-\infty$ is the greatest lower bound of $A$. [step 1.5, L1, L2]

2.6 In case I2 every element of $A$ equals $+\infty$, so $+\infty$ is a lower bound of $A$ by reflexivity, and $w \le +\infty$ for every $w$. So $+\infty$ is the greatest lower bound of $A$. [step 1.6, L1, L2]

2.7 In case I3 the real number $\iota := \inf A_{\mathbb{R}}$ exists and is a lower bound of $A$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$: an element of $A$ is either real, hence in $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ and $\ge \iota$, or equals $+\infty \ge \iota$; the value $-\infty$ does not occur in $A$ in this case. [step 1.7, L1, L4]

2.8 In case I4 the element $-\infty$ is a lower bound of $A$; any lower bound $w$ satisfies $w \ne +\infty$, because fixing $a \in A_{\mathbb{R}}$ gives $w \le a$ with $a$ real and $+\infty$ is above no real, while $w$ real would be a real lower bound of $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ and contradict the case hypothesis. So $w = -\infty$ is the greatest lower bound of $A$. [step 1.8, L1, L2, L5]

3.1 In case S3 let $v$ be any upper bound of $A$ and fix $a \in A_{\mathbb{R}}$, which is possible since $A_{\mathbb{R}} \ne \emptyset$. From $a \le v$ with $a$ real we get $v \ne -\infty$, since $-\infty$ is below no real. If $v = +\infty$ then $\sigma \le v$ because $+\infty$ is greatest. Otherwise $v$ is real, and it bounds $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ above in $\mathbb{R}$, so $\sigma \le v$ by leastness of the real supremum. Hence $\sigma$ is the least upper bound of $A$. [step 1.3, step 2.3, L1, L2, L3]

3.2 In case I3 let $w$ be a lower bound of $A$ and fix $a \in A_{\mathbb{R}}$. From $w \le a$ with $a$ real we get $w \ne +\infty$. If $w = -\infty$ then $w \le \iota$; otherwise $w$ is real and bounds $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ below in $\mathbb{R}$, so $w \le \iota$. Hence $\iota$ is the greatest lower bound of $A$. [step 1.7, step 2.7, L1, L2, L4]

4.1 The four supremum cases are exhaustive and mutually exclusive: either $+\infty \in A$, which is S1, or not, and then either $A_{\mathbb{R}} = \emptyset$, which is S2, or $A_{\mathbb{R}} \ne \emptyset$ and it is bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$, which is S3, or it is not, which is S4. In each case a least upper bound was produced, and it is unique. The same four alternatives with $-\infty$, $+\infty$ and "below" in place of $+\infty$, $-\infty$ and "above" are I1 to I4, and in each a greatest lower bound was produced. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, step 2.4, step 2.5, step 2.6, step 3.2, step 2.8, L2, L5, cases: a two-fold split followed by a three-fold split, cases-exhaustive]

5.1 The agreement clause follows: a nonempty $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$ satisfies $+\infty \notin A$ and $A_{\mathbb{R}} = A$, so case S3 applies and $\sup A = \sup A_{\mathbb{R}}$ is the real supremum; a nonempty $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ bounded below satisfies case I3 and $\inf A$ is the real infimum; and $A = \emptyset$ falls under S2 and I2, giving $\sup \emptyset = -\infty$ and $\inf \emptyset = +\infty$. [step 2.3, step 3.1, step 2.7, step 3.2, step 4.1, L3, L4] ∎

## Remarks

- **What makes this work is that $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ has a top and a bottom.**
  The three defining clauses of the order ([[def-extended-reals]]) put $+\infty$
  above everything and $-\infty$ below everything, and every case above is settled
  by one of those two facts or by the least-upper-bound property of $\mathbb{R}$
  applied to the real part. Nothing else about $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is used,
  and in particular no arithmetic is used at all.

- **The two exceptional cases of [[fs-every-set-has-sup]] are not repaired, they
  are relocated.** That false statement records that in $\mathbb{R}$ a set may
  fail to have a supremum, and it stays true; the discipline of
  [[rem-sup-conventions]], which refuses to write $\sup S = +\infty$ inside
  $\mathbb{R}$, also stays in force. What is proved here is a statement about a
  different ordered set.

- **The empty set is not an exception here, and that is the point of the
  ambient set.** In $\mathbb{R}$ the empty set has no supremum, because every
  real is an upper bound and there is no least one.
  In $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ every element is still an upper bound of $\emptyset$,
  but now there *is* a least one, namely $-\infty$. The two statements are about
  different ordered sets and neither contradicts the other.

- **Where this is consumed.** [[def-limsup-liminf]] needs the supremum of a tail
  range of an arbitrary real sequence, which may be unbounded, and then the
  infimum of the resulting family, which may contain $+\infty$; both are supplied
  here and by nothing earlier in the library. Fourteen items on this page depend
  on it, and five more on the companion page of examples.

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]), with tail ranges $T_n$ and
extended tail bounds $s_n = \sup T_n$, $i_n = \inf T_n$ as in
[[def-limsup-liminf]].

1. **Monotonicity of the extended bounds under inclusion.** If
   $A \subseteq B \subseteq \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-extended-reals]]) then
   $$\sup A \le \sup B \qquad \text{and} \qquad \inf B \le \inf A,$$
   the four quantities being the extended bounds of [[lem-extended-reals-complete]].
   No hypothesis is placed on $A$ or $B$; in particular $A$ may be empty.
2. **The tail bounds are monotone.** $T_m \subseteq T_n$ whenever $n \le m$, and
   hence
   $$s_m \le s_n \qquad \text{and} \qquad i_n \le i_m \qquad (n \le m).$$
   In particular $s_{n+1} \le s_n$ and $i_n \le i_{n+1}$ for every $n$, and
   $i_n \le s_n$ for every $n$.
3. **Existence.** $\limsup_k x_k$ and $\liminf_k x_k$ exist in
   $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ for **every** sequence of reals, bounded or not.

Claim 1 is the tool the rest of this page uses whenever two extended suprema are
compared. It is proved here, from the definition of a least upper bound, rather
than quoted from the suprema page, for the reason given in the remarks below.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals, its tail ranges $T_n = \{x_k : k \ge n\}$, and the extended bounds $s_n = \sup T_n$, $i_n = \inf T_n$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-limsup-liminf]]).

[L1] Every subset of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ has a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, with no hypothesis on the subset ([[lem-extended-reals-complete]]).

[L2] Least upper bound and greatest lower bound in a poset: $\sup A$ is an upper bound of $A$ that is $\le$ every upper bound of $A$, and $\inf A$ is a lower bound that is $\ge$ every lower bound; each is unique when it exists ([[def-upper-bound]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L3] $(\overline{\mathbb{R}}, \le)$ is a totally ordered set, so its order is reflexive and transitive ([[def-extended-reals]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L4] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total and transitive ([[def-nat-order]], [[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $A \subseteq B \subseteq \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ be arbitrary. By [L1] the four elements $\sup A$, $\sup B$, $\inf A$, $\inf B$ of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ all exist and are uniquely determined. [given, L1, L2]

1.2 Let $n \le m$ in $\mathbb{N}$. Every element of $T_m$ has the form $x_k$ with $k \ge m$, and then $k \ge n$ by transitivity, so $x_k \in T_n$; hence $T_m \subseteq T_n$. [given, L4]

1.3 For every $n$ the tail range $T_n$ contains $x_n$, so $i_n \le x_n$ because $i_n$ is a lower bound of $T_n$, and $x_n \le s_n$ because $s_n$ is an upper bound of $T_n$; transitivity gives $i_n \le s_n$. [given, L1, L2, L3]

2.1 Since $\sup B$ is an upper bound of $B$ and $A \subseteq B$, every element of $A$ is $\le \sup B$, so $\sup B$ is an upper bound of $A$; as $\sup A$ is the least of the upper bounds of $A$, this gives $\sup A \le \sup B$. Dually $\inf B$ is a lower bound of $B$, hence of $A$, and as $\inf A$ is the greatest of the lower bounds of $A$ this gives $\inf B \le \inf A$. Claim 1 is proved. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

3.1 Applying claim 1 to the inclusion $T_m \subseteq T_n$ valid for $n \le m$ gives $s_m \le s_n$ and $i_n \le i_m$; the special case $m = n + 1$ gives $s_{n+1} \le s_n$ and $i_n \le i_{n+1}$. Together with $i_n \le s_n$ this is claim 2. [step 1.2, step 1.3, step 2.1]

4.1 The families $\{s_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ and $\{i_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ are subsets of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, so [L1] applies to them with no hypothesis, and $\limsup_k x_k = \inf\{s_n\}$ and $\liminf_k x_k = \sup\{i_n\}$ exist in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ for every sequence of reals. This is claim 3. [step 3.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Remarks

- **The monotonicity is where the two operations of the definition interlock.**
  Because $(s_n)$ is nonincreasing, the outer infimum in
  $\limsup_k x_k = \inf_n s_n$ is an infimum of a decreasing family, so it is the
  value the tail suprema are pressing down towards; and because $(i_n)$ is
  nondecreasing, $\liminf_k x_k = \sup_n i_n$ is the value the tail infima are
  pressing up towards. Nothing in this lemma says the pressing converges, and for
  an unbounded sequence there is nothing in $\mathbb{R}$ for it to converge to;
  the exact statement is [[lem-limsup-epsilon-characterisation]].

- **Why the word "nonincreasing" is spelled out rather than cited.**
  [[def-monotone-sequence]] defines monotone for sequences of *reals*, and
  $(s_n)$ takes values in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, so the definition does not
  apply to it. Claim 2 is therefore stated as the inequality it is. When $(x_k)$
  is bounded every $s_n$ is real ([[def-limsup-liminf]]) and $(s_n)$ is then a
  nonincreasing sequence of reals in the sense of [[def-monotone-sequence]], but
  no proof on this page needs that reading.

- **Claim 1 is not [[lem-sup-monotone]].** That lemma is the same one-line
  argument carried out in $\mathbb{R}$, and its statement carries the hypotheses
  that the smaller set be nonempty and the larger one bounded above, without
  which neither supremum denotes anything. Those are exactly the hypotheses that
  the extended bounds of [[lem-extended-reals-complete]] dispense with, so the
  extended statement is not an instance of the real one and is proved from the
  definition of a least upper bound instead.

- **Claim 1 costs nothing and is used everywhere.** It is the one-line poset
  argument: the larger set's supremum bounds the smaller set, and leastness does
  the rest. It is stated as part of this lemma rather than as an item of its own
  because it is used only in company with the tail bounds.

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]), with $\limsup$ and
$\liminf$ as in [[def-limsup-liminf]].

1. For $L \in \mathbb{R}$: $(x_k)$ converges to $L$ ([[def-real-limit]]) **if and
   only if** $\liminf_k x_k = \limsup_k x_k = L$.
2. $x_k \to +\infty$ ([[def-divergence-to-infinity]]) **if and only if**
   $\liminf_k x_k = \limsup_k x_k = +\infty$. Moreover $\liminf_k x_k = +\infty$
   on its own already forces $\limsup_k x_k = +\infty$.
3. $x_k \to -\infty$ **if and only if** $\liminf_k x_k = \limsup_k x_k = -\infty$,
   and $\limsup_k x_k = -\infty$ on its own already forces
   $\liminf_k x_k = -\infty$.

The three clauses combine into one statement about the extended line: for
$L \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$, the sequence $(x_k)$ converges to $L$ in
$\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-extended-limits]]) if and only if

$$\liminf_{k} x_k = \limsup_{k} x_k = L .$$

Since $\liminf_k x_k \le \limsup_k x_k$ always ([[lem-liminf-le-limsup]]), the
single equation $\liminf_k x_k = \limsup_k x_k$ is therefore equivalent to
convergence in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, and the common value is the limit. A
sequence that neither converges nor diverges to $\pm\infty$ is exactly one for
which the inequality is strict.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals, its tail ranges $T_n = \{x_k : k \ge n\}$, the extended tail bounds $s_n = \sup T_n$ and $i_n = \inf T_n$, and the quantities $\limsup_k x_k = \inf\{s_n\}$, $\liminf_k x_k = \sup\{i_n\}$ ([[def-limsup-liminf]]).

[L1] All of $s_n$, $i_n$, $\limsup_k x_k$ and $\liminf_k x_k$ exist in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ for every sequence; $i_n$ is the greatest lower bound of $T_n$ and $\liminf_k x_k$ the least upper bound of $\{i_n\}$, with the dual descriptions for $s_n$ and $\limsup_k x_k$ ([[lem-limsup-exists]], [[lem-extended-reals-complete]], [[def-upper-bound]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L2] The order on $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is total, so the failure of $a \le b$ is $b < a$; it restricts on $\mathbb{R}$ to the order of $\mathbb{R}$; $+\infty$ is the greatest element and $-\infty$ the least; and every real is $< +\infty$ and $> -\infty$ ([[def-extended-reals]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L3] Epsilon characterisation, for a real $L$: $L = \limsup_k x_k$ exactly when for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ one has $x_k < L + \varepsilon$ eventually and $x_k > L - \varepsilon$ frequently; and $L = \liminf_k x_k$ exactly when for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ one has $x_k > L - \varepsilon$ eventually and $x_k < L + \varepsilon$ frequently ([[lem-limsup-epsilon-characterisation]]).

[L4] $\liminf_k x_k \le \limsup_k x_k$ ([[lem-liminf-le-limsup]]).

[L5] Reflection: $\limsup_k(-x_k) = -\liminf_k x_k$ and $\liminf_k(-x_k) = -\limsup_k x_k$ ([[lem-limsup-reflection]]). Also $x_k \to -\infty$ if and only if $-x_k \to +\infty$: the condition $x_k < M$ for all $k \ge K$ is equivalent to $-x_k > -M$ for all $k \ge K$ by order reversal, and $M$ runs over all reals exactly when $-M$ does ([[def-divergence-to-infinity]]); the order reversal used here is strict, and the form stated in [[lem-of-add-order]] is likewise strict, so nothing nonstrict is being borrowed from it.

[L6] Convergence to a real $L$ means: for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with $|x_k - L| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$; and the same relation is obtained by testing every real $\varepsilon > 0$ instead, since below any positive real lies a positive rational ([[def-real-limit]], [[def-sequence]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L7] Divergence: $x_k \to +\infty$ means that for every real $M$ there is $K$ with $x_k > M$ for all $k \ge K$ ([[def-divergence-to-infinity]]).

[L8] Eventually and frequently, and the fact that a property holding eventually holds frequently, since indices beyond any two given thresholds exist by totality of the order on $\mathbb{N}$; likewise two properties each holding eventually hold together from the larger threshold on ([[def-sequence]], [[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

[L9] Absolute value: for $c > 0$, $|a| < c$ if and only if $-c < a < c$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L10] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: $0 < 1$, so $t < t + 1$ for every real $t$, and no real is above every real; adding a constant preserves the order ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For the forward implication of claim 1, assume $L \in \mathbb{R}$ and that $(x_k)$ converges to $L$. [assume-hyp, L6]

1.2 For the converse implication of claim 1, assume $L \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\liminf_k x_k = \limsup_k x_k = L$. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.3 For the forward implication of claim 2, assume $x_k \to +\infty$. [assume-hyp, L7]

1.4 For the converse implication of claim 2, assume $\liminf_k x_k = +\infty$. [assume-hyp, L1]

2.1 Under the assumption of step 1.1, let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real. Testing convergence at $\varepsilon$ gives $K$ with $|x_k - L| < \varepsilon$, hence $L - \varepsilon < x_k < L + \varepsilon$, for all $k \ge K$. So $x_k < L + \varepsilon$ eventually and $x_k > L - \varepsilon$ eventually, and each of the two therefore also holds frequently. Both halves of each characterisation in [L3] are met, so $\limsup_k x_k = L$ and $\liminf_k x_k = L$. [step 1.1, L3, L6, L8, L9]

2.2 Under the assumption of step 1.2, let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real. The forward halves of the two characterisations in [L3] give $x_k < L + \varepsilon$ for all $k$ beyond some $K_1$ and $x_k > L - \varepsilon$ for all $k$ beyond some $K_2$; beyond the larger of $K_1$ and $K_2$ both hold, so $|x_k - L| < \varepsilon$ there. This holds for every real $\varepsilon > 0$, in particular for every rational one, so $(x_k)$ converges to $L$. [step 1.2, L3, L6, L8, L9]

2.3 Under the assumption of step 1.3, let $M$ be an arbitrary real and take $K$ with $x_k > M$ for all $k \ge K$. Then $M$ is a lower bound of $T_K$, so $M \le i_K$, and $i_K \le \liminf_k x_k$ because $\liminf_k x_k$ is an upper bound of $\{i_n\}$; hence $M \le \liminf_k x_k$. Since $M$ was an arbitrary real, $\liminf_k x_k$ is not $-\infty$, which lies below every real, and it is not a real $t$ either, since $M = t + 1$ would give $t + 1 \le t$. So $\liminf_k x_k = +\infty$. [step 1.3, L1, L2, L7, L10]

2.4 Under the assumption of step 1.4, let $M$ be an arbitrary real. Since $\sup\{i_n\} = +\infty$ and $M < +\infty$, the real $M$ is not an upper bound of $\{i_n\}$, for otherwise the least upper bound would satisfy $+\infty \le M$; by totality there is $n$ with $i_n > M$. Every $k \ge n$ satisfies $x_k \ge i_n > M$, so $x_k > M$ eventually. As $M$ was arbitrary, $x_k \to +\infty$. [step 1.4, L1, L2, L7]

3.1 Steps 2.1 and 2.2 are the two implications of claim 1. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L3]

3.2 For claim 2: if $x_k \to +\infty$ then $\liminf_k x_k = +\infty$ by step 2.3, and then $+\infty = \liminf_k x_k \le \limsup_k x_k$ forces $\limsup_k x_k = +\infty$ since $+\infty$ is the greatest element; conversely if $\liminf_k x_k = \limsup_k x_k = +\infty$ then in particular $\liminf_k x_k = +\infty$ and step 2.4 gives $x_k \to +\infty$. The same use of [L4] is the additional assertion that $\liminf_k x_k = +\infty$ alone forces $\limsup_k x_k = +\infty$. [step 2.3, step 2.4, L2, L4]

4.1 For claim 3, reflection gives $x_k \to -\infty$ exactly when $-x_k \to +\infty$, which by claim 2 holds exactly when $\liminf_k(-x_k) = \limsup_k(-x_k) = +\infty$, that is $-\limsup_k x_k = -\liminf_k x_k = +\infty$, that is $\limsup_k x_k = \liminf_k x_k = -\infty$; and $\limsup_k x_k = -\infty$ alone forces $\liminf_k x_k \le -\infty$, hence $\liminf_k x_k = -\infty$, since $-\infty$ is least. Claims 1, 2 and 3 together say that for $L \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ the sequence converges to $L$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ exactly when $\liminf_k x_k = \limsup_k x_k = L$, since the three clauses of that definition are convergence to a real $L$, divergence to $+\infty$ and divergence to $-\infty$. [step 3.1, step 3.2, L2, L4, L5] ∎

## Remarks

- **This is the theorem that makes $\limsup$ and $\liminf$ worth defining.** They
  exist for every sequence, with no hypothesis, and their coincidence is exactly
  convergence in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$. So a question about convergence becomes
  a question about two computable quantities, and a proof of convergence can be
  assembled from one-sided estimates without a candidate limit in hand.

- **The equation is between elements of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, and reading it in
  $\mathbb{R}$ would lose two thirds of the content.** Clauses 2 and 3 are
  statements about divergence, and they are true statements about
  [[def-divergence-to-infinity]], not a redefinition of it: nothing above claims
  that a sequence diverging to $+\infty$ has a limit in $\mathbb{R}$, and the
  symbol $+\infty$ occurring in them is the element of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$
  introduced in [[def-extended-reals]].

- **A sequence with $\liminf < \limsup$ does neither.** The alternating sequence
  is the standard witness, with the two values $-1$ and $1$
  ([[ex-limsup-of-alternating-sequence]]); it is bounded, so it also does not
  diverge to $\pm\infty$, and the theorem says its failure to converge is exactly
  the gap between the two quantities.

## Statement

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be nonempty and bounded below. Then $S$ has a
greatest lower bound in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-infimum]]), and it is given by

$$\inf S = -\sup(-S), \qquad \text{where } -S = \{-s : s \in S\}.$$

In particular the complete ordered field $\mathbb{R}$ has the
greatest-lower-bound property, which is therefore not an extra axiom: it is a
consequence of the least-upper-bound property.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A nonempty $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ that is bounded below, and its reflection $-S = \{-s : s \in S\}$.

[L1] The least-upper-bound property of $\mathbb{R}$: every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $\mathbb{R}$, namely an upper bound that is $\le$ every upper bound ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Reflection: $-(-S) = S$; $S$ is nonempty exactly when $-S$ is; $u$ is an upper bound of a set $X$ exactly when $-u$ is a lower bound of $-X$; and $\ell$ is a lower bound of $X$ exactly when $-\ell$ is an upper bound of $-X$ ([[lem-reflection]]).

[L3] Greatest lower bound (infimum): $\ell$ is one for $S$ when $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$ and $\ell' \le \ell$ for every lower bound $\ell'$ of $S$ ([[def-infimum]]).

[L4] A least upper bound and a greatest lower bound are unique when they exist, so the notations $\sup$ and $\inf$ are unambiguous ([[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L5] Negation reverses the order, elementwise: $-(-a) = a$, because $(-a) + a = 0$ and additive inverses are unique ([[def-field]], [[lem-of-inverse-unique]]); and $a \le b$ if and only if $-b \le -a$, because translation invariance applied with the constant $-a - b$ turns $a < b$ into $-b < -a$ and, applied with the constant $a + b$, turns $-b < -a$ back into $a < b$, while $a = b$ holds exactly when $-a = -b$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By hypothesis $S \ne \emptyset$ and $S$ is bounded below; fix a lower bound $\ell_0$ of $S$, so $\ell_0 \le s$ for every $s \in S$. [given, choose]

1.2 Let $\ell'$ be an arbitrary lower bound of $S$; then $-\ell'$ is an upper bound of $-S$. [assume-hyp, L2]

2.1 Since $S$ is nonempty, so is $-S$, and since $\ell_0$ is a lower bound of $S$, its negative $-\ell_0$ is an upper bound of $-S$; hence $-S$ is a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 By the least-upper-bound property, $-S$ has a least upper bound in $\mathbb{R}$; write $u := \sup(-S)$, which is well defined by uniqueness. [step 2.1, L1, L4]

4.1 Define $\ell := -u$. [step 3.1, construct]

4.2 The element $u$ is the least of the upper bounds of $-S$ and $-\ell'$ is one of them, hence $u \le -\ell'$. [step 1.2, step 3.1, L1]

5.1 Apply the reflection fact to the set $-S$: since $u$ is an upper bound of $-S$, its negative $-u$ is a lower bound of $-(-S)$, and $-(-S) = S$; so $\ell = -u$ is a lower bound of $S$. [step 4.1, step 3.1, L2]

5.2 Negating the inequality $u \le -\ell'$ reverses it, giving $-(-\ell') \le -u$, that is $\ell' \le \ell$. [step 4.2, step 4.1, L5]

6.1 Thus $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$ satisfying $\ell' \le \ell$ for every lower bound $\ell'$ of $S$, so $\ell$ is a greatest lower bound of $S$; it is the only one, so $\inf S$ exists and $\inf S = \ell = -\sup(-S)$. [step 5.1, step 5.2, L3, L4] ∎

## Remarks

- The theorem is not a restatement of the least-upper-bound property: it is proved from it, by transporting the problem across the order-reversing bijection $x \mapsto -x$ of [[lem-reflection]]. Nothing about $\mathbb{R}$ beyond the complete-ordered-field axioms is used.
- The hypotheses are both needed. The empty set is bounded below by every real and has no greatest lower bound, and a set unbounded below has no lower bound at all; the dual failures for suprema are recorded in [[fs-every-set-has-sup]].
- The identity $\inf S = -\sup(-S)$ is the standard device for turning any statement about suprema into its dual; [[lem-inf-epsilon]] is the first application on this page.

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]) and write
$\Lambda := \limsup_{k} x_k \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-limsup-liminf]]).
Then, with the extended subsequential limit set
$\overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$ of [[def-extended-limits]]:

1. $\Lambda \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$: there is a strictly increasing
   $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that $(x_{n_j})$ converges to $\Lambda$ in
   $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$;
2. $L \le \Lambda$ for every $L \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$.

So $\overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$ is **nonempty** and has a **greatest
element**, and that element is $\limsup_k x_k$. In particular every sequence of
reals whatever has a subsequence that converges in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$.

**The extended set is the right home for this statement, and the real set is
not.** The finite subsequential limit set $\operatorname{SL}(x)$ of
[[def-subsequential-limit]] may be empty, and when it is not it may have a
greatest element different from $\limsup_k x_k$; both failures are exhibited by
the dedicated counterexample on the companion page. What is true for
$\operatorname{SL}(x)$ follows: when $\Lambda$ is a real number, claim 1 puts it
in $\operatorname{SL}(x)$, since the two sets agree on $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-extended-limits]]), and claim 2 then makes it the greatest element there
too.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals, its tail ranges $T_n = \{x_k : k \ge n\}$, the extended tail suprema $s_n = \sup T_n$, and $\Lambda := \limsup_k x_k = \inf\{s_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ ([[def-limsup-liminf]]).

[L1] All of $s_n$ and $\Lambda$ exist in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, with $s_n$ the least upper bound of $T_n$ and $\Lambda$ the greatest lower bound of $\{s_n\}$ ([[lem-limsup-exists]], [[lem-extended-reals-complete]], [[def-upper-bound]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L2] The order on $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is total, so the failure of $a \le b$ is $b < a$; $-\infty$ is least and $+\infty$ greatest; every real is $< +\infty$ and $> -\infty$; and on $\mathbb{R}$ the order is that of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-extended-reals]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L3] Epsilon characterisation for a real $\Lambda$: for every real $\eta > 0$ one has $x_k < \Lambda + \eta$ eventually and $x_k > \Lambda - \eta$ frequently ([[lem-limsup-epsilon-characterisation]]).

[L4] Recursion theorem: for a set $A$, an element $a \in A$ and a function $f : A \to A$ there is a unique $g : \mathbb{N} \to A$ with $g_0 = a$ and $g_{j+1} = f(g_j)$ ([[thm-recursion]]).

[L5] Well-ordering principle: every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L6] Index maps: if $n_j < n_{j+1}$ for every $j$ then $n$ is strictly increasing, and then $n_j \ge j$ for every $j$; the composite $(x_{n_j})$ is a subsequence ([[lem-index-map-grows]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L7] Convergence in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ and the extended subsequential limit set ([[def-extended-limits]]); convergence to a real, for which it suffices to produce a threshold for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-real-limit]], [[def-sequence]]); divergence to $\pm\infty$ ([[def-divergence-to-infinity]]); and $|a - b| < c$ if and only if $b - c < a < b + c$ for $c > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L8] If $\limsup_k x_k = -\infty$ then $\liminf_k x_k = -\infty$ and $x_k \to -\infty$ ([[lem-liminf-le-limsup]], [[thm-convergence-iff-limsup-equals-liminf]]).

[L9] Limits preserve non-strict inequalities: if $y_j \le c$ for all large $j$ and $y_j \to y$ in $\mathbb{R}$, then $y \le c$ ([[lem-limit-preserves-order]]).

[L10] Archimedean facts: for every real $M$ there is a natural $p \ge 1$ with $M < p \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$, and for every real $\eta > 0$ a natural $m \ge 1$ with $1/m < \eta$; the canonical naturals satisfy $0 \le n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ and are increasing in $n$, and $0 < a \le b$ gives $0 < 1/b \le 1/a$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]], [[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

[L11] Strictly between any two reals lies a rational, hence a real ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L12] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total and transitive, so any two indices have a common upper bound ([[def-nat-order]], [[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 The element $\Lambda = \limsup_k x_k$ exists in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, and exactly one of the following holds: $\Lambda$ is a real number, $\Lambda = +\infty$, or $\Lambda = -\infty$. [given, L1, L2]

1.2 Suppose $\Lambda = +\infty$. Since $\Lambda$ is a lower bound of $\{s_n\}$, every $n$ has $+\infty \le s_n$ and so $s_n = +\infty$. Consequently, for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and every real $M$ there is $k \ge n$ with $x_k > M$: otherwise $M$ would be an upper bound of $T_n$ and leastness would give $s_n \le M$, contradicting $M < +\infty$. [given, L1, L2]

1.3 Suppose $\Lambda$ is real. Then for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and every real $\eta > 0$ there is $k \ge n$ with $|x_k - \Lambda| < \eta$: by [L3] fix $K$ with $x_k < \Lambda + \eta$ for all $k \ge K$, let $K'$ be an index at least as large as both $n$ and $K$, and use that $x_k > \Lambda - \eta$ frequently to obtain $k \ge K'$ with $x_k > \Lambda - \eta$; that $k$ satisfies $k \ge K$, hence also $x_k < \Lambda + \eta$, and $k \ge n$. [given, L3, L7, L12]

1.4 Suppose $\Lambda = -\infty$. Then $x_k \to -\infty$ by [L8], and the identity map $j \mapsto j$ is strictly increasing, so the subsequence $(x_j)$ of $(x_k)$ converges to $-\infty$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ and $\Lambda \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$. [given, L6, L7, L8]

1.5 Let $L \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$ be arbitrary and fix a strictly increasing $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that $(x_{n_j})$ converges to $L$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$; then $n_j \ge j$ for every $j$. [given, L6, L7]

2.1 In the case $\Lambda = +\infty$, define $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ by letting $f(n)$ be the least element of $E_n := \{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : k > n \text{ and } x_k > n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} \,\}$, which is nonempty by step 1.2 applied with the index $n+1$ and the real $M = n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$, and let $a$ be the least element of $\{\, k : x_k > 0 \,\}$, nonempty by step 1.2 with $n = 0$ and $M = 0$. Then $f(n) > n$ and $x_{f(n)} > n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ for every $n$. [step 1.2, L5, construct]

2.2 In the case $\Lambda$ real, define $g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ by letting $g(n)$ be the least element of $F_n := \{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : k > n \text{ and } |x_k - \Lambda| < 1/(n+1) \,\}$, which is nonempty by step 1.3 applied with the index $n+1$ and $\eta = 1/(n+1) > 0$, and let $b$ be the least element of $\{\, k : |x_k - \Lambda| < 1 \,\}$, nonempty by step 1.3 with $n = 0$ and $\eta = 1$. Then $g(n) > n$ and $|x_{g(n)} - \Lambda| < 1/(n+1)$ for every $n$. [step 1.3, L5, L10, construct]

2.3 If $L = -\infty$ then $L \le \Lambda$, since $-\infty$ is the least element of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$. [step 1.5, L2]

2.4 If $L = +\infty$, then for every real $M$ there is $J$ with $x_{n_j} > M$ for all $j \ge J$. Fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and a real $M$, and take $j$ at least as large as both $J$ and $n$; then $n_j \ge j \ge n$, so $x_{n_j} \in T_n$ and $M < x_{n_j} \le s_n$. As $M$ was an arbitrary real, $s_n$ is neither real nor $-\infty$, so $s_n = +\infty$; as $n$ was arbitrary, $\Lambda = \inf\{s_n\} = +\infty$ and $L \le \Lambda$. [step 1.5, L1, L2, L7, L12]

2.5 If $L$ is real, suppose for the sake of the comparison that $\Lambda < L$. By step 1.1 the element $\Lambda$ is then real or $-\infty$; choose a real $c$ with $\Lambda < c < L$, taking a rational strictly between $\Lambda$ and $L$ in the first case and $c := L - 1$ in the second. Since $\Lambda$ is the greatest lower bound of $\{s_n\}$ and $\Lambda < c$, the element $c$ is not a lower bound, so there is $n$ with $s_n < c$, and then $x_k \le s_n < c$ for every $k \ge n$. For $j \ge n$ we have $n_j \ge j \ge n$, hence $x_{n_j} \le c$, so $L \le c$ by [L9], contradicting $c < L$. By totality $L \le \Lambda$. [step 1.5, step 1.1, L1, L2, L9, L11]

3.1 In the case $\Lambda = +\infty$, the recursion theorem applied to $\mathbb{N}$, the element $a$ and the function $f$ gives $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ with $n_0 = a$ and $n_{j+1} = f(n_j)$. Then $n_j < n_{j+1}$ for every $j$, so $n$ is strictly increasing and $n_j \ge j$; and $x_{n_{j+1}} > n_j \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} \ge j \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ for every $j$. [step 2.1, L4, L6, L10]

3.2 In the case $\Lambda$ real, the recursion theorem applied to $\mathbb{N}$, the element $b$ and the function $g$ gives $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ with $n_0 = b$ and $n_{j+1} = g(n_j)$. Then $n$ is strictly increasing with $n_j \ge j$, and $|x_{n_{j+1}} - \Lambda| < 1/(n_j + 1) \le 1/(j+1)$ for every $j$. [step 2.2, L4, L6, L10]

4.1 In the case $\Lambda = +\infty$, the subsequence $(x_{n_j})$ diverges to $+\infty$: given a real $M$, take a natural $p \ge 1$ with $M < p \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$; every $j \ge p + 1$ satisfies $j - 1 \ge p$, so step 3.1 applied at $j - 1$ gives $x_{n_j} > (j-1) \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} \ge p \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} > M$. Hence $(x_{n_j})$ converges to $+\infty = \Lambda$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ and $\Lambda \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$. [step 3.1, L7, L10, L12]

4.2 In the case $\Lambda$ real, the subsequence $(x_{n_j})$ converges to $\Lambda$: given a real $\varepsilon > 0$, take a natural $m \ge 1$ with $1/m < \varepsilon$; every $j \ge m$ satisfies $j \ge 1$, so step 3.2 applied at $j - 1$ gives $|x_{n_j} - \Lambda| < 1/j \le 1/m < \varepsilon$. Producing such a threshold for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ establishes convergence, so $(x_{n_j})$ converges to $\Lambda$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ and $\Lambda \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$. [step 3.2, L7, L10]

5.1 The three cases of step 1.1 are exhaustive, and each produces a subsequence converging to $\Lambda$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$: step 4.1 when $\Lambda = +\infty$, step 4.2 when $\Lambda$ is real, and step 1.4 when $\Lambda = -\infty$. So $\Lambda \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$, which is claim 1. [step 4.1, step 4.2, step 1.4, L7]

6.1 Steps 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 cover the three possibilities for an arbitrary $L \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$ and give $L \le \Lambda$ in each, which is claim 2. With claim 1 this makes $\overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$ nonempty with greatest element $\Lambda = \limsup_k x_k$. [step 5.1, step 2.3, step 2.4, step 2.5, L2, discharge-construct] ∎

## Remarks

- **The construction uses no choice.** Both index maps are built by taking a
  *least* element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]) of an explicitly described
  nonempty set of naturals, so the functions $f$ and $g$ are defined outright and
  [[thm-recursion]] then produces the index map. This is the same device as in
  [[lem-peak-monotone-subsequence]], and for the same reason: a subsequence
  selected by repeated arbitrary choices would need a choice principle, and none
  is needed here.

- **Why the recursion threshold is indexed by the previous index rather than by
  the step number.** The recursion theorem produces a function of one variable, so
  the state carried from one step to the next is the index $n_j$ alone. Demanding
  $x_{n_{j+1}} > n_j$ rather than $x_{n_{j+1}} > j$ keeps that single-variable
  form, and $n_j \ge j$ ([[lem-index-map-grows]]) then upgrades the bound to the
  one actually wanted. The same trick fixes the accuracy in the finite case at
  $1/(n_j+1) \le 1/(j+1)$.

- **Claim 2 is where the $\limsup$ earns the word "greatest".** A subsequence
  cannot do better than the tail suprema allow: past any index $n$, every term of
  the sequence, and so every term of any subsequence, is at most $s_n$, and
  $\Lambda$ is the infimum of those. That is the entire content of step 2.5, and
  the strictness of the inequality $\Lambda < c$ is what gives the contradiction,
  since a limit inherits only the non-strict inequality
  ([[lem-limit-preserves-order]]).

- **Both failures of the real version really occur**, and
  [[cex-limsup-infinite-not-attained-in-r]] on the companion page is the witness:
  there $\operatorname{SL}(x)$ is nonempty with greatest element $0$ while
  $\limsup_k x_k = +\infty$.

- **The dual statement is [[cor-liminf-is-least-subsequential-limit]]**, obtained
  from this theorem by reflection rather than by repeating the construction.

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ be sequences of reals ([[def-sequence]]) and write
$\Lambda := \limsup_{k} x_k$, $M := \limsup_{k} y_k$
([[def-limsup-liminf]]).

1. If the sum $\Lambda + M$ is defined in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$
   ([[def-extended-reals]]), that is if $\{\Lambda, M\} \ne \{+\infty, -\infty\}$,
   then
   $$\limsup_{k}(x_k + y_k) \;\le\; \Lambda + M .$$
2. Dually, writing $\lambda := \liminf_k x_k$ and $\mu := \liminf_k y_k$, if
   $\lambda + \mu$ is defined in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ then
   $$\liminf_{k}(x_k + y_k) \;\ge\; \lambda + \mu .$$

**The hypothesis is exactly the one [[def-extended-reals]] forces, and it cannot
be dropped.** When one of $\Lambda$, $M$ is $+\infty$ and the other $-\infty$ the
right-hand side is not an element of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ at all, so there is
nothing to compare. The inequality is genuinely an inequality: equality can fail,
and does, for an alternating pair of sequences; the failure of additivity is
recorded as a false statement among this page's examples, and the witness is a
named counterexample on the companion page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ of reals, their termwise sum $(x_k + y_k)$, and $\Lambda := \limsup_k x_k$, $M := \limsup_k y_k$, assumed to have a sum defined in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$.

[L1] Tail bounds and the two quantities exist in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ for every sequence, $s_n$ being the least upper bound of the $n$-th tail range and $\limsup$ the greatest lower bound of $\{s_n\}$ ([[lem-limsup-exists]], [[lem-extended-reals-complete]], [[def-limsup-liminf]], [[def-upper-bound]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L2] The order on $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is total and transitive, $+\infty$ is its greatest element and $-\infty$ its least, and it restricts on $\mathbb{R}$ to the order of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-extended-reals]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L3] Partial addition on $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$: a sum is undefined only for the pairs $(+\infty, -\infty)$ and $(-\infty, +\infty)$; a sum with one summand $+\infty$ and the other $\ne -\infty$ is $+\infty$; a sum with one summand $-\infty$ and the other $\ne +\infty$ is $-\infty$; and $-(a+b) = (-a) + (-b)$, each side defined exactly when the other is ([[def-extended-reals]]).

[L4] Epsilon characterisation for a real limit superior: $\Lambda = \limsup_k x_k$ real implies that for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ one has $x_k < \Lambda + \varepsilon$ eventually ([[lem-limsup-epsilon-characterisation]]).

[L5] $\limsup_k z_k = -\infty$ implies $z_k \to -\infty$; and $z_k \to -\infty$ implies $\limsup_k z_k = -\infty$ ([[lem-liminf-le-limsup]], [[thm-convergence-iff-limsup-equals-liminf]], [[def-divergence-to-infinity]]).

[L6] Reflection: $\limsup_k(-z_k) = -\liminf_k z_k$ and $\liminf_k(-z_k) = -\limsup_k z_k$ ([[lem-limsup-reflection]]).

[L7] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: [[lem-of-add-order]] states the strict forms, that inequalities may be translated and added, so $a < a'$ and $b < b'$ give $a + b < a' + b'$; adjoining the case of equality, in which both sides move by the same amount, gives the nonstrict forms used below. In particular $a \le b$ if and only if $-b \le -a$: translation by $-a-b$ turns $a < b$ into $-b < -a$ and back, while $a = b$ holds exactly when $-a = -b$.

[L8] Reciprocal Archimedean property and canonical naturals: for every real $\delta > 0$ there is a natural $m \ge 1$ with $1/m < \delta$; for a natural $m \ge 1$ the element $2m$ is a natural $\ge 1$ with $(2m) \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} = 2\big(m \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}\big) > 0$, so $1/(2m) > 0$ and $1/(2m) + 1/(2m) = 1/m$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L9] Two properties each holding eventually hold together from the larger of the two thresholds on ([[def-sequence]], [[thm-nat-linear-order]], [[def-nat-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Since $\Lambda + M$ is defined, exactly one of the following three situations holds: at least one of $\Lambda$, $M$ equals $+\infty$, and then the other is $\ne -\infty$; both are real; or neither equals $+\infty$ and at least one equals $-\infty$. Both the hypothesis and the conclusion of claim 1 are unchanged by exchanging the two sequences, so in the third situation it may be assumed that $\Lambda = -\infty$. [given, L2, L3]

2.1 In the first situation $\Lambda + M = +\infty$ by the addition table, and every element of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is $\le +\infty$, so $\limsup_k(x_k + y_k) \le \Lambda + M$. [step 1.1, L2, L3]

2.2 In the second situation let $\delta > 0$ be an arbitrary real, take a natural $m \ge 1$ with $1/m < \delta$ and put $\varepsilon := 1/(2m) > 0$, so that $\varepsilon + \varepsilon = 1/m < \delta$. By [L4] there are thresholds beyond which $x_k < \Lambda + \varepsilon$ and beyond which $y_k < M + \varepsilon$; beyond the larger of them both hold, so adding the two inequalities gives $x_k + y_k < \Lambda + M + \varepsilon + \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge N$, where $N$ is that larger threshold. Hence $\Lambda + M + \varepsilon + \varepsilon$ is an upper bound of the $N$-th tail range of $(x_k + y_k)$, so the $N$-th tail supremum is $\le \Lambda + M + \varepsilon + \varepsilon$, and therefore $\limsup_k(x_k + y_k) \le \Lambda + M + \varepsilon + \varepsilon < \Lambda + M + \delta$. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L4, L7, L8, L9]

2.3 In the third situation, with $\Lambda = -\infty$, first note that there is a real $B$ with $y_k < B$ eventually: if $M$ is real, [L4] with $\varepsilon = 1$ gives $y_k < M + 1$ eventually, so $B := M + 1$ serves; and if $M = -\infty$ then $y_k \to -\infty$ by [L5], so $y_k < 0$ eventually and $B := 0$ serves. Also $\Lambda = -\infty$ gives $x_k \to -\infty$ by [L5]. Now let $c$ be an arbitrary real: since $c - B$ is real, $x_k < c - B$ eventually, and beyond the larger threshold both that and $y_k < B$ hold, so $x_k + y_k < (c - B) + B = c$ there. As $c$ was arbitrary, $x_k + y_k \to -\infty$, hence $\limsup_k(x_k + y_k) = -\infty = \Lambda + M$ by [L5] and the addition table. [step 1.1, L3, L4, L5, L7, L9]

3.1 In the second situation the conclusion follows from step 2.2: taking $\delta = 1$ shows $\limsup_k(x_k + y_k) \le \Lambda + M + 1$, a real number, so the left-hand side is not $+\infty$; if it is $-\infty$ then it is $\le \Lambda + M$ because $-\infty$ is least; and if it is a real $S$ with $S > \Lambda + M$, then $\delta_0 := S - (\Lambda + M) > 0$ and step 2.2 applied with $\delta = \delta_0$ gives $S < \Lambda + M + \delta_0 = S$, which is impossible. So $\limsup_k(x_k + y_k) \le \Lambda + M$ by totality. [step 2.2, L2, L7]

4.1 Claim 1 now holds in all three situations, by steps 2.1, 3.1 and 2.3. [step 2.1, step 3.1, step 2.3, step 1.1]

5.1 For claim 2, suppose $\lambda + \mu$ is defined. By [L6] the reflected sequences have $\limsup_k(-x_k) = -\lambda$ and $\limsup_k(-y_k) = -\mu$, and $(-\lambda) + (-\mu) = -(\lambda + \mu)$ is defined exactly when $\lambda + \mu$ is, by [L3]. Claim 1 applied to $(-x_k)$ and $(-y_k)$, whose termwise sum is $(-(x_k + y_k))$, therefore gives $-\liminf_k(x_k + y_k) = \limsup_k\big(-(x_k+y_k)\big) \le (-\lambda) + (-\mu) = -(\lambda + \mu)$; reflecting this inequality reverses it into $\liminf_k(x_k + y_k) \ge \lambda + \mu$. [step 4.1, L3, L6, L7] ∎

## Remarks

- **The three situations are not decoration.** The middle one is the analytic
  content and the outer two are genuinely different arguments: the first is
  vacuous because $+\infty$ bounds everything, and the third is a statement about
  divergence to $-\infty$ that has to be proved, since a sum of two sequences each
  running off to $-\infty$, or one running off with the other merely bounded
  above, is not covered by any algebra of limits
  ([[def-divergence-to-infinity]] forbids that).

- **Why the real supremum of a sumset is not used.** The natural one-line route,
  $s_n(x+y) \le s_n(x) + s_n(y)$ followed by a passage to the infimum, needs the
  first inequality in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ and then still needs an $\varepsilon$
  argument to compare $\inf_n\big(s_n(x) + s_n(y)\big)$ with
  $\Lambda + M$. The identity $\sup(S+T) = \sup S + \sup T$ of [[lem-sup-sum]]
  does not apply, since it requires both sets to be nonempty subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$ bounded above, and a tail range of an unbounded sequence is not.
  The $\varepsilon$ argument is therefore made directly, once.

- **Both halves of the $\varepsilon$ split are reciprocals of natural numbers, not halvings in
  $\mathbb{R}$.** Choosing $m$ with $1/m < \delta$ and then working with
  $1/(2m)$ keeps every quantity a reciprocal of a canonical natural, so the only
  field facts used are that positives are invertible and that inequalities add.

- **Equality is the exception.** Without a hypothesis on one of the two
  sequences the gap can be as large as the whole oscillation, as
  [[cex-limsup-subadditivity-strict]] shows. It is standard, and neither needed
  nor proved on this page, that the inequality becomes an equality as soon as one
  of the two sequences converges to a real limit.
