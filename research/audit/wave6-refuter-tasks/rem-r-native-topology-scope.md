This page builds the topology of $\mathbb{R}$ out of the order and the absolute
value alone: a neighbourhood is an interval ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), and open
and closed are defined from neighbourhoods ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]). Some
of what follows uses nothing else about $\mathbb{R}$, and some of it is written
in order vocabulary from beginning to end. This remark separates the two, so a
reader knows which results are candidates for reuse elsewhere and which are not
even statable elsewhere. **It asserts nothing about topological spaces in
general: they are developed later in this library, on the page of
[[def-topological-space]] and [[def-metrizable-space]], where the metric
development becomes a special case, but no claim about them is made or needed
here and nothing below rests on them.**

**Results that use only the definitions.** [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]] and
[[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] use openness, closedness, closure and the
nesting property of neighbourhoods, together with the comparison of two positive
radii, and nothing beyond that. Neither the least-upper-bound property nor the
Archimedean property appears in either proof, and their statements mention no
interval, no bound and no order, so those statements would still make sense
wherever a notion of neighbourhood is available, however it arises.

**Results that cannot be separated from the order of $\mathbb{R}$.** Four
results on this page depend on the order. For the first three the order is in
what they say and not merely in how they are proved; for the fourth it is in the
proof only, and the bullet says so.

- [[thm-open-subsets-of-r-structure]] says that an open set is a countable
  disjoint union of **open intervals**. An interval is defined by the order
  ([[def-interval]]), the components are the classes of an equivalence relation
  defined by order-convexity, and the identification of a component as an
  interval is carried out with $\sup$ and $\inf$. Delete the order and there is
  no statement left to prove.
- [[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]] characterises connectedness by
  **order-convexity**. Connectedness itself is defined without the order
  ([[def-connected-r]]), but the property it is being equated with is an order
  property, so the theorem is a bridge between an order notion and a topological
  one and exists only where both are present.
- [[thm-heine-borel-r]] and [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]] speak of
  **closed bounded intervals** and of **bounded** sets. Boundedness is an order
  notion ([[def-bounded-set]]), and the proof of the first is a bisection, which
  uses the midpoint and hence the field operations as well. The completeness of
  $\mathbb{R}$ enters through [[thm-nested-interval-property]].
- [[thm-compact-iff-sequentially-compact-r]] routes **both** implications
  through the previous item, whose backward half spends the least-upper-bound
  property, and its **forward** implication additionally uses
  [[thm-bolzano-weierstrass]], which spends that property again; the backward
  implication does not use Bolzano-Weierstrass at all. Its statement mentions
  only compactness and sequences ([[def-open-cover-r]]), so unlike the three
  above it *is* statable without an order; the dependence lies entirely in the
  proof. This library provides no other proof, so nothing here licenses the
  equivalence outside $\mathbb{R}$.

**Where the dependence on completeness is visible rather than merely present.**
[[fs-closed-bounded-compact-without-completeness]] refutes, inside this library,
the claim that closed and bounded implies compact in an arbitrary ordered field,
and [[cex-closed-bounded-in-q-not-compact]] names the witness in $\mathbb{Q}$.
That is the sharpest statement this page makes about the limits of its own
results: the Heine-Borel characterisation is not a formal consequence of the
definitions, and it fails in the nearest ordered field that is not complete.

**The metric topology of $\mathbb{R}$ is the topology of this page.** This
library does develop metric spaces ([[def-metric-space]],
[[def-metric-topology]]), and $\mathbb{R}$ under $d(x,y) = |x-y|$ is one of them
([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]). The two resulting notions of *open subset
of $\mathbb{R}$* are not merely equivalent but literally the same condition, and
unfolding the definitions is the whole of the proof: claim 2 of that lemma gives
$B(x,r) = (x-r,\ x+r)$, which is exactly the neighbourhood $N_r(x)$ of
[[def-neighbourhood-r]], so "every point of $U$ admits a ball inside $U$" and
"every point of $U$ admits a neighbourhood inside $U$"
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) say the same thing word for word. This page still
proves everything from the order directly, so that nothing here rests on the
metric development; the identification is recorded so that a reader moving
between the two pages knows they are looking at one topology and not two.
Because the two collections of open sets are one collection, everything built
from them is one notion as well. The interior, closure and boundary of
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]] and of
[[def-metric-interior-closure-boundary]] are the same three sets, since each
side characterises them in both of the same two ways, pointwise by
neighbourhoods and by extremality among the open subsets and the closed
supersets ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]],
[[thm-metric-closure-characterisation]]); limit point, isolated point, adherent
point and dense are defined by literally the same condition on the two sides
([[def-limit-point-r]]), once $N_\varepsilon(x)$ and $B(x,\varepsilon)$ are
recognised as the same set; and
[[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]] is the case $X = \mathbb{R}$ of
[[thm-metric-sequential-closure]], spending the axiom of countable choice in the
same one of the two directions.

**Bounded means the same here as it does in the metric development, and that
agreement is not a topological fact.** [[def-bounded-set]] calls
$A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ bounded when it has both a lower and an upper bound,
while [[def-metric-bounded-diameter]] calls it bounded when it is empty or lies
inside some ball of $(\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$. The two conditions hold of
exactly the same subsets of $\mathbb{R}$. If $A \subseteq B(x_0,r) = (x_0 - r,\
x_0 + r)$ ([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]], claim 2, [[def-metric-ball]])
then $x_0 - r$ and $x_0 + r$ bound $A$ below and above; conversely, if
$\ell \le a \le u$ for every $a \in A$ and $A \ne \varnothing$, then $\ell \le u$
and $A \subseteq B(\ell,\ u - \ell + 1)$, the radius being at least $1$ and hence
positive; and an empty $A$ is bounded under both definitions, vacuously under the
first and by the explicit empty clause of the second. So the word **bounded** in
[[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]] may be read in either sense without
changing which sets the theorem names.

What may not be done is to read that theorem as a statement about the topology.
Boundedness is a property of the metric and not of the topology it induces
([[fs-boundedness-is-a-topological-property]]): the metric
$\rho(u,v) = \min\{|u-v|,\ 1\}$ induces exactly the open sets of this page, and
under it every subset of $\mathbb{R}$, including $\mathbb{R}$ itself, is
bounded. Since the open sets are unchanged, compactness ([[def-open-cover-r]])
is unchanged too, and $\mathbb{R}$ is not compact, being unbounded in the order
sense ([[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]]); yet $\mathbb{R}$ is closed,
and $\rho$-bounded. So "closed and bounded implies compact" is false for $\rho$
and true for $d_{\mathbb{R}}$, on one and the same topology. The identification
in the previous paragraph is with the usual metric specifically, and Heine-Borel
is a theorem about that metric and the order it comes from, not about the
topology alone.

**What is deliberately not claimed.** Whether the results above have analogues in
a setting carrying a topology with no order available at all, and whether
compactness and sequential compactness agree there, are questions about general
topological spaces. This library takes those questions up on a later page, where
[[def-metrizable-space]] identifies the metric development, this page's topology
included, as a special case of the general one; but nothing on **this** page
proves anything about general spaces, and the reader should take no assertion
about them from here. What is claimed here is narrower and
is checkable line by line against the proofs: in the four results listed above,
the order of $\mathbb{R}$ is used, and in three of them it is used in the
statement itself.

## Statement refuted

**Refuted claim:** in every ordered field a closed bounded set is compact, so the
completeness hypothesis of the Heine-Borel characterisation is unnecessary
([[fs-closed-bounded-compact-without-completeness]]).

The witness is the ordered field $\mathbb{Q}$ ([[def-rationals]],
[[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) together with

$$S \;:=\; \{\, q \in \mathbb{Q} : q \ge 0 \text{ and } q^2 < 2 \,\} .$$

The set $S$ is bounded, is closed in $\mathbb{Q}$, and is not compact in
$\mathbb{Q}$, all with respect to the vocabulary of
[[def-open-cover-r]] transposed from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{Q}$ exactly as set
out in [[fs-closed-bounded-compact-without-completeness]], where the refutation
is carried out in full. This item records the witness and says what makes it
work.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The ordered field $\mathbb{Q}$ and the set $S := \{\, q \in \mathbb{Q} : q \ge 0 \text{ and } q^2 < 2 \,\}$, with "open in $\mathbb{Q}$", "closed in $\mathbb{Q}$", "bounded" and "compact in $\mathbb{Q}$" as defined in [[fs-closed-bounded-compact-without-completeness]].

[A1] The refuted claim: in every ordered field a closed bounded set is compact.

[L1] $S$ is nonempty and bounded, has no greatest element, is closed in $\mathbb{Q}$, and the family $\{\, \{\, y \in \mathbb{Q} : y < r \,\} : r \in S \,\}$ is a cover of $S$ by sets open in $\mathbb{Q}$ with no finite subfamily covering $S$ ([[fs-closed-bounded-compact-without-completeness]]).

[L2] $\mathbb{Q}$ is a totally ordered field ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]], [[def-rationals]], [[def-ordered-field]]), with the absolute value of [[def-abs-value]] and its basic properties ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L3] No rational number squares to $2$ ([[fs-sqrt2-rational]]).

[L4] Squaring is strictly monotone on the nonnegatives of an ordered field ([[lem-of-square-monotone]]).

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $\mathbb{Q}$ is an ordered field by [L2], so it is a legitimate instance of the claim [A1]. [A1, L2]

1.2 $S$ is bounded and closed in $\mathbb{Q}$ by [L1]; the closedness rests on the fact that no rational squares to $2$ ([L3]), which is what makes the complement of $S$ split into the rationals below $0$ and those whose square exceeds $2$, and on the monotonicity of squaring ([L4]), which is what makes each of those two pieces open in $\mathbb{Q}$. [L1, L2, L3, L4]

1.3 $S$ is not compact in $\mathbb{Q}$: the cover exhibited in [L1] consists of sets open in $\mathbb{Q}$, covers $S$ because $S$ has no greatest element, and admits no finite subfamily covering $S$, since the largest index of such a subfamily is itself a member of $S$ that the subfamily leaves uncovered. [L1, L2]

2.1 So the ordered field $\mathbb{Q}$ carries a bounded set that is closed in $\mathbb{Q}$ and not compact in $\mathbb{Q}$, and the claim [A1] is refuted. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, A1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **What is closed in $\mathbb{Q}$ is not closed in $\mathbb{R}$.** Read inside
  $\mathbb{R}$, the same collection of numbers is bounded and fails to be
  closed: the real $\sqrt 2$, which exists by [[thm-of-square-roots]] and is not
  rational by [[fs-sqrt2-rational]], is adherent to it and absent from it. The
  set is closed in $\mathbb{Q}$
  precisely because the point that would have to be adjoined to close it does
  not lie in $\mathbb{Q}$. Closedness is a statement about a set inside an
  ambient field, not about the set alone.

- **Only one half of Heine-Borel fails here.** That a compact set is closed and
  bounded ([[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]]) uses no completeness at
  all, only the Archimedean property and the existence of maxima of finite sets;
  the converse
  ([[thm-heine-borel-r]] and [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]]) is the half
  that spends completeness, and it is the half refuted here.

- **Why this witness rather than $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$.** Both work: a set with
  rational endpoints is also closed and bounded in $\mathbb{Q}$ and also fails to
  be compact there, but its non-compactness has to be produced by splitting it
  at some irrational chosen for the purpose. In $S$ the irrational is already
  built in, and the same fact, the irrationality of $\sqrt 2$
  ([[fs-sqrt2-rational]]), delivers both closedness in $\mathbb{Q}$ and the
  absence of a finite subcover. The witness therefore runs on exactly the
  mechanism of the false statement it refutes.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ denotes the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a subset of it.

The notions **upper bound** and **bounded above** are already fixed by
[[def-complete-ordered-field]] and are only recalled here, never redefined:
$u \in \mathbb{R}$ is an *upper bound* of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$, and
$S$ is *bounded above* if it has at least one upper bound. The dual notions are:

- $\ell \in \mathbb{R}$ is a **lower bound** of $S$ if $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.
- $S$ is **bounded below** if it has at least one lower bound.
- $S$ is **bounded** if it is both bounded above and bounded below, that is, if
  there are $\ell, u \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\ell \le s \le u$ for every $s \in S$.

## Remarks

- A bound is an element of $\mathbb{R}$ and is not required to lie in $S$. A
  bound that does lie in $S$ is a maximum or a minimum ([[def-max-min]]), and
  that is a strictly stronger condition ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Bounds come in half-lines: if $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$ then so is every
  $\ell'' \le \ell$, and if $u$ is an upper bound then so is every $u'' \ge u$.
  Consequently a set that has one bound of a given kind has infinitely many, and
  the interesting question is whether the collection of them has a best element,
  which is what a supremum ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) or an infimum
  ([[def-infimum]]) is.
- Bounded above and bounded below are independent conditions. The set
  $A = \{\, n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} : n \ge 1 \,\}$ of canonical naturals of
  $\mathbb{R}$ is bounded below by $0$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]) and is not
  bounded above ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); its reflection $-A$ is bounded above
  and not bounded below ([[lem-reflection]]).
- The empty set is bounded, and vacuously so: every real number is both an upper
  bound and a lower bound of $\emptyset$, since the defining condition quantifies
  over no elements. Having bounds is therefore much weaker than having a least
  upper bound or a greatest lower bound ([[fs-every-set-has-sup]]).

## Definition

Let $A, B, E \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with closure as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]].

- $A$ and $B$ are **separated** when
  $$\overline{A} \cap B = \varnothing \quad \text{and} \quad A \cap \overline{B} = \varnothing .$$
- A **disconnection** of $E$ is a pair $(A,B)$ of nonempty separated sets with
  $E = A \cup B$.
- $E$ is **disconnected** when it admits a disconnection, and **connected** when
  it does not.

**Separated is strictly stronger than disjoint.** Since $A \subseteq
\overline{A}$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]), the first displayed
condition already gives $A \cap B \subseteq \overline{A} \cap B = \varnothing$,
so separated sets are disjoint. The converse fails: $(0,1)$ and $[1,2)$ are
disjoint, yet every neighbourhood of $1$ meets $(0,1)$, so $1$ is an adherent
point of $(0,1)$ and lies in $\overline{(0,1)}$
([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]]), while $1 \in [1,2)$; hence
$\overline{(0,1)} \cap [1,2) \ne \varnothing$ and the pair is not separated.
What separation adds to disjointness is exactly this: **neither set of a
separated pair may contain a point adherent to the other**, which is what makes
a disconnection a genuine splitting rather than a bookkeeping partition.

**Separation does not ask the two closures to be disjoint.** Each condition
tests one closure against the *other set*, never closure against closure. The
pair $(0,1)$, $(1,2)$ illustrates the difference and is separated: $[0,1]$ is a
closed set containing $(0,1)$, so $\overline{(0,1)} \subseteq [0,1]$
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]) and
$\overline{(0,1)} \cap (1,2) = \varnothing$; symmetrically
$\overline{(1,2)} \subseteq [1,2]$ and $(0,1) \cap \overline{(1,2)} =
\varnothing$. The two closures nevertheless share the point $1$, so a definition
demanding $\overline{A} \cap \overline{B} = \varnothing$ would be a different and
strictly stronger condition, and it is not the one used here.

## Remarks

- **Why separation and not "both pieces open".** For a subset $E$ of
  $\mathbb{R}$ the pieces of a splitting are rarely open as subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$: in the disconnection of $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,2]$ used by
  [[cex-rationals-in-an-interval-are-disconnected]] neither piece is open in
  $\mathbb{R}$. Rudin's separated-sets formulation avoids introducing a second
  topology relative to $E$, and it is the only formulation this page uses.
  Nothing below refers to sets open "in $E$".

- **Every one-point set and the empty set are connected.** A disconnection
  requires two nonempty pieces with union $E$, and if $E$ has at most one point
  no two nonempty disjoint sets have union $E$.

- **Connectedness of a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ turns out to be an order
  property**: $E$ is connected exactly when it is order-convex
  ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]]). That is a theorem about
  $\mathbb{R}$ and uses its completeness; the definition above mentions no order
  at all.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with open and closed sets as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

- The **interior** of $A$ is the union of all open subsets of $A$:
  $$A^{\circ} \;:=\; \bigcup \{\, U \subseteq \mathbb{R} : U \text{ open and } U \subseteq A \,\}.$$
- The **closure** of $A$ is the intersection of all closed supersets of $A$:
  $$\overline{A} \;:=\; \bigcap \{\, F \subseteq \mathbb{R} : F \text{ closed and } A \subseteq F \,\}.$$
- The **boundary** of $A$ is $\partial A := \overline{A} \setminus A^{\circ}$.
- The **exterior** of $A$ is $\operatorname{ext} A := (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)^{\circ}$.

**Both operators are well defined and deliver what their names claim.** The
family whose union defines $A^{\circ}$ always contains $\varnothing$, and the
family whose intersection defines $\overline{A}$ always contains $\mathbb{R}$,
so the second family is nonempty and both expressions denote subsets of
$\mathbb{R}$ without appeal to any convention about empty unions or
intersections. Moreover:

- $A^{\circ}$ is **open**, being a union of open sets
  ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], claim 1), and $A^{\circ} \subseteq A$, since
  every set in the family is a subset of $A$. It is therefore the **largest**
  open subset of $A$: any open $U \subseteq A$ is a member of the family and so
  $U \subseteq A^{\circ}$.
- $\overline{A}$ is **closed**, being an intersection of a nonempty family of
  closed sets ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], claim 3), and $A \subseteq
  \overline{A}$, since every set in the family contains $A$. It is therefore the
  **smallest** closed superset of $A$: any closed $F \supseteq A$ is a member of
  the family and so $\overline{A} \subseteq F$.

**Pointwise description of the interior.** For $x \in \mathbb{R}$,

$$x \in A^{\circ} \iff \text{there is } \varepsilon > 0 \text{ with } N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A .$$

If $x \in A^{\circ}$ then, $A^{\circ}$ being open and containing $x$, there is
$\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A^{\circ} \subseteq A$.
Conversely if $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A$ then $N_\varepsilon(x)$ is an open
subset of $A$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) containing $x$, hence
$x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A^{\circ}$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

The corresponding pointwise description of the closure is not a definitional
matter and is proved separately, as [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

## Remarks

- **The four sets partition nothing by themselves, but three of them do.** For
  every $A$ the three sets $A^{\circ}$, $\partial A$ and $\operatorname{ext} A$
  are pairwise disjoint with union $\mathbb{R}$. This is not proved here and is
  not used on this page; what is used is only the definitions above and the
  characterisations of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

- **Interior and closure are dual.** Complementation exchanges the two families
  above, since $U$ is open exactly when $\mathbb{R} \setminus U$ is closed, so
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus A^{\circ} = \overline{\mathbb{R} \setminus A}$ and
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A} = (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)^{\circ} =
  \operatorname{ext} A$. The second identity is the reason the exterior is
  usually described as "the complement of the closure".

- **$A$ is open exactly when $A = A^{\circ}$, and closed exactly when
  $A = \overline{A}$.** For the first: $A^{\circ} \subseteq A$ always, and
  $A \subseteq A^{\circ}$ holds exactly when $A$ is one of the open subsets of
  $A$, that is, exactly when $A$ is open. The closure half is the same argument
  read the other way, and it is recorded as a claim of
  [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] because the rest of that theorem needs it.

- **Boundary points may or may not belong to the set.** $\partial (0,1) =
  \partial [0,1] = \{0,1\}$, and the two boundary points lie outside the first
  set and inside the second; the boundary sees only the way the set meets its
  complement, not which side the edge is assigned to.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]] and closure as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]].

- $x$ is an **adherent point** of $A$ when $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne
  \varnothing$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$.
- $x$ is a **limit point** (or *accumulation point*) of $A$ when
  $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every real
  $\varepsilon > 0$: every punctured neighbourhood of $x$ meets $A$.
- $x$ is an **isolated point** of $A$ when $x \in A$ and there is a real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$.
- The **derived set** of $A$ is
  $$A' \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \text{ is a limit point of } A \,\}.$$
- $A$ is **dense in $\mathbb{R}$** when $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$.

**A limit point is an adherent point**, since $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq
N_\varepsilon(x)$; and an element of $A$ is an adherent point of $A$, since
$x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). So the adherent
points of $A$ are exactly the points of $A \cup A'$, a statement proved as part
of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

**Limit point and isolated point are exact opposites inside $A$.** For
$x \in A$: $x$ is an isolated point of $A$ exactly when it is not a limit point
of $A$. Indeed $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$ says precisely that
$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, because $x$ itself always lies in
$N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ when $x \in A$; so the existence of an $\varepsilon$
witnessing isolation is the negation of the condition defining a limit point.
A point of $A$ is therefore either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$, and
never both.

**A limit point need not belong to the set, and a point of the set need not be a
limit point.** Both possibilities occur, and the two examples that matter later
are $0$, which is a limit point of $\{\, 1/k : k \ge 1 \,\}$ without belonging
to it, and $0$ again, which belongs to $\{0\} \cup [1,2]$ as an isolated point.

## Remarks

- **Terminology: *limit point* here is about a set, never about a sequence.**
  This library reserves *subsequential limit* for the sequential notion
  ([[def-subsequential-limit]]), and the two are genuinely different: the
  constant sequence $x_k = 0$ has $0$ as a subsequential limit, while its set of
  values $\{0\}$ has no limit point at all. The distinction is the one
  [[def-subsequential-limit]] records under "Terminology", and it is respected
  throughout this page.

- **Density is defined through the closure, not through intervals.** Saying
  $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$ is equivalent to saying that every nonempty open
  subset of $\mathbb{R}$ meets $A$, and also to saying that every neighbourhood
  of every real meets $A$; the equivalences follow from
  [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] and are used in that form in
  [[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]].

- **The derived set need not be comparable with the set.** It can be strictly
  larger, as for $\mathbb{Q}$: every punctured neighbourhood of any real
  contains a rational, since density supplies one strictly between $x$ and
  $x + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]), so the derived set of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is all of $\mathbb{R}$. It can be strictly smaller, as for
  $\{0\}$, whose derived set is empty; and it can be neither, as for
  $\{0\} \cup (1,2)$, whose derived set is $[1,2]$, a set containing points
  outside the original and omitting the point $0$ of it. A closed set satisfying
  $A \subseteq A'$ is called perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]).

## Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]), let $x \in X$ and let
$r \in \mathbb{R}$ with $r > 0$ ([[def-real-order]]). Define

$$B(x,r) := \{\, y \in X : d(x,y) < r \,\}, \qquad \bar B(x,r) := \{\, y \in X : d(x,y) \le r \,\}, \qquad S(x,r) := \{\, y \in X : d(x,y) = r \,\}.$$

$B(x,r)$ is the **open ball**, $\bar B(x,r)$ the **closed ball** and $S(x,r)$ the
**sphere** of **centre** $x$ and **radius** $r$. The radius is always a strictly
positive real; a ball of radius $0$ or of negative radius is never written in
this library.

**Immediate consequences of the definitions.** For every $x \in X$ and $r > 0$:

- $x \in B(x,r)$, because $d(x,x) = 0 < r$ (axiom (M1) of [[def-metric-space]]);
  in particular open and closed balls are nonempty.
- $B(x,r) \subseteq \bar B(x,r)$ and $S(x,r) \subseteq \bar B(x,r)$, and
  $\bar B(x,r)$ is the disjoint union of $B(x,r)$ and $S(x,r)$, by trichotomy of
  the order of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]):
  each $y$ satisfies exactly one of $d(x,y) < r$, $d(x,y) = r$, $d(x,y) > r$.
- If $0 < s \le r$ then $B(x,s) \subseteq B(x,r)$ and
  $\bar B(x,s) \subseteq \bar B(x,r)$, by transitivity of the order.
- Nonnegativity of the metric ([[lem-metric-nonnegativity]]) is what forces the
  radius convention, and it forces it for the **open** ball only: if $r \le 0$
  then $B(x,r) = \{y : d(x,y) < r\}$ is empty, because $d(x,y) \ge 0 \ge r$
  for every $y$. The other two sets behave differently at $r = 0$, and the
  convention $r > 0$ excludes them for uniformity rather than for emptiness:
  $\bar B(x,0) = S(x,0) = \{x\}$, since $d(x,y) \le 0$ together with
  $d(x,y) \ge 0$ gives $d(x,y) = 0$ and hence $y = x$ by (M1). For $r < 0$ all
  three sets are empty.

**A sphere may be empty, and so the three sets are not on a par.** For $r > 0$
the open and closed balls always contain $x$, but nothing in the definition
produces a point at distance exactly $r$ from $x$. If a metric takes only the
values $0$ and $1$, as the discrete metric on the companion page does, then
$S(x,2) = \emptyset$ while $B(x,2) = \bar B(x,2)$ is the whole space. So
nonemptiness of a sphere is never available by convention: where it is used, it
is proved.

**The ambient space is part of the notation.** $B(x,r)$ depends on $(X,d)$ and
not on $x$ and $r$ alone. When more than one space or more than one metric is in
play we write $B_X(x,r)$, or $B_d(x,r)$, and likewise for $\bar B$ and $S$. This
matters as soon as subspaces appear ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]): a
ball of a subspace is the trace on it of a ball of the ambient space, and the two
are different sets.

## Remarks

- **The names "open ball" and "closed ball" are justified, not merely
  suggestive.** That $B(x,r)$ is an open set and $\bar B(x,r)$ a closed set in
  the metric topology is proved in [[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]]; the words are
  used here only as names for the three sets displayed above.
- **The closed ball is not in general the closure of the open ball**, and the
  sphere is not in general the boundary of either. Both failures are recorded on
  this page as [[fs-closed-ball-is-the-closure-of-the-open-ball]] and witnessed
  on the companion page. The safe reading of the three names is the displayed
  one and nothing more.

## Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]) and let
$A, B \subseteq X$.

**Bounded subset.** $A$ is **bounded** if $A = \emptyset$ or there are $x_0 \in X$
and a real $r > 0$ with $A \subseteq B(x_0, r)$ ([[def-metric-ball]]). The space
$(X,d)$ is a **bounded metric space** if $X$ is a bounded subset of itself.

**Diameter, for nonempty bounded $A$ only.** Suppose $A$ is nonempty and
bounded, and put

$$D(A) := \{\, d(a,b) : a, b \in A \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}.$$

Then $D(A)$ is nonempty, since $A$ is, and it is bounded above: fixing $x_0$ and
$r$ with $A \subseteq B(x_0,r)$, every $a, b \in A$ satisfy
$d(a,b) \le d(a,x_0) + d(x_0,b) < r + r$ by the triangle inequality, symmetry
([[def-metric-space]]) and addition of inequalities ([[lem-of-add-order]],
[[def-ordered-field]]), so $r + r$ is an upper bound of $D(A)$
([[def-bounded-set]]). Hence $D(A)$ has a least upper bound in $\mathbb{R}$ by
the least-upper-bound property ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), and that bound
is unique ([[lem-sup-unique]]). Define

$$\operatorname{diam}(A) := \sup D(A).$$

**Distance from a point to a set, for nonempty $A$ only.** Let $x \in X$ and let
$A$ be nonempty, and put $E(x,A) := \{\, d(x,a) : a \in A \,\}$. Then $E(x,A)$ is
nonempty and bounded below by $0$, since a metric is nonnegative
([[lem-metric-nonnegativity]], [[def-bounded-set]]), so it has a greatest lower
bound ([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]), unique by [[lem-sup-unique]].
Define

$$d(x,A) := \inf E(x,A).$$

**Distance between two sets, for nonempty $A$ and $B$ only.** Put
$E(A,B) := \{\, d(a,b) : a \in A,\ b \in B \,\}$, again nonempty and bounded
below by $0$, and define

$$d(A,B) := \inf E(A,B).$$

**Every one of the three scope restrictions is load bearing.** In this library
$\sup$ and $\inf$ denote real numbers and are written only after existence has
been established; the extended real line is introduced on a later page and is
not used for the suprema and infima taken here, and no convention
$\sup \emptyset = -\infty$ is in force in this development
([[rem-sup-conventions]]). Accordingly:

- $\operatorname{diam}(A)$ is defined exactly when $A$ is nonempty **and**
  bounded. It is not defined for $A = \emptyset$, and it is not defined, not even
  as an infinite value, for an unbounded $A$.
- $d(x,A)$ is defined exactly when $A \ne \emptyset$, and $d(A,B)$ exactly when
  both $A$ and $B$ are nonempty. No boundedness is needed for these two, because
  $0$ is always a lower bound.

## Remarks

- **Diameter and the distance functions are nonnegative.** For nonempty bounded
  $A$ and any $a \in A$ we have $0 = d(a,a) \in D(A)$, so
  $\operatorname{diam}(A) \ge 0$; and $d(x,A) \ge 0$, $d(A,B) \ge 0$ because $0$
  is a lower bound of the sets they are infima of
  ([[lem-metric-nonnegativity]], [[def-infimum]]).
- **$d(A,B)$ is not a metric on the nonempty subsets of $X$.** It is symmetric
  and vanishes on $A = B$, but two distinct disjoint sets can be at distance $0$,
  so the separation axiom (M1) of [[def-metric-space]] fails; the witness is on
  the companion page. The letter $d$ is reused for three different functions
  here, the metric, the point-to-set distance and the set-to-set distance, only
  because the arguments make the intended one unambiguous.
- **$d(x,A)$ is the special case $d(\{x\},A)$**, since
  $E(\{x\},A) = E(x,A)$, and the two infima therefore agree by uniqueness
  ([[lem-sup-unique]]).

## Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]), let $A \subseteq X$ and let
$x \in X$. Balls are as in [[def-metric-ball]] and open sets as in
[[def-metric-topology]]; recall that a real $r$ written as a radius is always
$> 0$.

- $x$ is an **interior point** of $A$ if $B(x,r) \subseteq A$ for some $r$. The
  set of interior points is the **interior** $\operatorname{int}(A)$.
- $x$ is an **adherent point** of $A$ if $B(x,r) \cap A \ne \emptyset$ for every
  $r$. The set of adherent points is the **closure** $\overline{A}$.
- $x$ is a **limit point** (accumulation point) of $A$ if
  $B(x,r) \cap (A \setminus \{x\}) \ne \emptyset$ for every $r$. The set of limit
  points is the **derived set** $A'$.
- $x$ is an **isolated point** of $A$ if $x \in A$ and $B(x,r) \cap A = \{x\}$
  for some $r$.
- The **boundary** of $A$ is $\partial A := \overline{A} \setminus \operatorname{int}(A)$.
- $A$ is **dense** in $X$ if $\overline{A} = X$.

**The interior is open, and it is the largest open subset of $A$.** If
$x \in \operatorname{int}(A)$, fix $r$ with $B(x,r) \subseteq A$; the ball
$B(x,r)$ is itself open ([[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]]), so every
$y \in B(x,r)$ has some $s$ with $B(y,s) \subseteq B(x,r) \subseteq A$, which
puts $y$ in $\operatorname{int}(A)$. Hence $B(x,r) \subseteq \operatorname{int}(A)$
and $\operatorname{int}(A)$ is open. It is contained in $A$, since
$x \in B(x,r) \subseteq A$ for an interior point $x$; and if $V \subseteq A$ is
open then every $v \in V$ has a ball inside $V \subseteq A$, so
$V \subseteq \operatorname{int}(A)$.

**Two descriptions of the boundary agree.** $x \in \partial A$ says that every
ball around $x$ meets $A$ and that no ball around $x$ is contained in $A$; the
second half says exactly that every ball around $x$ meets $X \setminus A$. So

$$\partial A = \{\, x \in X : B(x,r) \cap A \ne \emptyset \text{ and } B(x,r) \cap (X \setminus A) \ne \emptyset \text{ for every } r \,\},$$

from which $\partial A = \partial(X \setminus A)$ is immediate.

**Elementary containments, straight from the definitions.** $A \subseteq \overline{A}$,
because $x \in A$ lies in every $B(x,r) \cap A$; $A' \subseteq \overline{A}$,
because a ball meeting $A \setminus \{x\}$ meets $A$; and
$\operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq A \subseteq \overline{A}$. A point of $A$ is
either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$, and not both, according to
whether some ball meets $A$ only in $x$.

## Remarks

- **The closure is defined here by adherent points and by nothing else.** That it
  is closed, that it is the smallest closed set containing $A$, that for nonempty
  $A$ it is $\{x : d(x,A) = 0\}$, and that it consists of the limits of sequences
  from $A$, are theorems ([[thm-metric-closure-characterisation]],
  [[thm-metric-sequential-closure]]) and are proved from this definition.
- **Limit point of a set is not the same notion as subsequential limit of a
  sequence** ([[def-subsequential-limit]]), which this library deliberately keeps
  under a different name: the constant sequence $x_k = 0$ has $0$ as a
  subsequential limit, while its set of values $\{0\}$ has no limit point at all.
- **Dense is relative to the ambient space**, and the ambient space is part of
  the data: $A$ is dense in $X$ when $\overline{A} = X$, with $\overline{A}$
  computed in $(X,d)$. The same $A$ inside a larger space is a different
  question.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) constructed in this
library ([[def-real-numbers]]) and carrying its order ([[def-real-order]]).

Let $X$ be a set. A **metric** on $X$ is a function
$d : X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $x, y, z \in X$:

- **(M1) Separation.** $d(x,y) = 0$ if and only if $x = y$.
- **(M2) Symmetry.** $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$.
- **(M3) Triangle inequality.** $d(x,z) \le d(x,y) + d(y,z)$.

A **metric space** is a pair $(X,d)$ consisting of a set $X$ and a metric $d$ on
it. The elements of $X$ are its **points** and $d(x,y)$ is the **distance** from
$x$ to $y$. When only one metric is in play we write $X$ for $(X,d)$; when
several are, the metric is always named.

**The values of a metric are real numbers.** The codomain is $\mathbb{R}$, so
$d(x,y)$ is an honest element of the complete ordered field and every
inequality above is an inequality there. No infinite value is permitted;
[[rem-metric-axiom-conventions]] records why extended metrics are not treated in
this library.

**Nonnegativity is deliberately absent from the axiom list.** Many texts add a
fourth axiom $d(x,y) \ge 0$. It is redundant: (M1), (M2) and (M3) already force
it, as [[lem-metric-nonnegativity]] proves. Nothing below assumes it before that
lemma is available.

**Pseudometric.** A **pseudometric** on $X$ is a function
$p : X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying (M2), (M3) and the weakening

- **(M1') Reflexivity.** $p(x,x) = 0$ for every $x \in X$

of (M1). A pseudometric may therefore assign distance $0$ to two distinct
points. Every metric is a pseudometric, and a pseudometric is a metric exactly
when $p(x,y) = 0$ forces $x = y$.

**Ultrametric.** An **ultrametric** on $X$ is a metric $d$ that in addition
satisfies

- **(M3') Strong triangle inequality.** $d(x,z) \le \max\{d(x,y), d(y,z)\}$

for all $x, y, z \in X$, where the maximum is that of a two-element subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, which exists and is one of the two elements
([[def-max-min]], [[lem-finite-set-has-max]]). An **ultrametric space** is a pair
$(X,d)$ with $d$ an ultrametric.

## Remarks

- **(M3') is a genuine strengthening of (M3), not an independent axiom on top of
  it.** A function satisfying (M1), (M2) and (M3') automatically satisfies (M3):
  by [[lem-metric-nonnegativity]] such a function is nonnegative, and for
  nonnegative reals $a, b$ one has $\max\{a,b\} \le a + b$, since the maximum is
  one of $a, b$ and the other summand is $\ge 0$. So "a metric satisfying (M3')"
  and "a function satisfying (M1), (M2), (M3')" describe the same objects, and
  the definition above may be read either way.

- **Why the biconditional form of (M1).** Splitting (M1) into "$d(x,x) = 0$" and
  "$d(x,y) = 0 \Rightarrow x = y$" gives the same notion; the split form is what
  makes the pseudometric weakening above a matter of deleting one clause. The
  naming fork between *pseudometric* and *semimetric*, which is live in the
  literature, is settled for this library in
  [[rem-metric-axiom-conventions]].

- **The metric is part of the data.** Two different metrics on the same set are
  two different metric spaces, even when they have the same open sets. That is
  why [[def-equivalent-metrics]] compares metrics at three separate strengths
  rather than one, and why a property can be invariant under one of them and not
  under another ([[fs-boundedness-is-a-topological-property]]).

## Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]).

A subset $U \subseteq X$ is **open in $(X,d)$** if for every $x \in U$ there is a
real $r > 0$ with $B(x,r) \subseteq U$ ([[def-metric-ball]]). A subset
$F \subseteq X$ is **closed in $(X,d)$** if its complement $X \setminus F$ is
open.

The collection

$$\mathcal{T}_d := \{\, U \subseteq X : U \text{ is open in } (X,d) \,\}$$

of all open subsets is the **metric topology** of $d$ on $X$. A subset of $X$
that is both open and closed is called **clopen**.

**Two sets are open for trivial reasons.** $\emptyset$ is open, because the
defining condition quantifies over no points; and $X$ is open, because
$B(x,r) \subseteq X$ for every $x$ and every $r > 0$. Consequently $X$ and
$\emptyset$ are also closed, and both are clopen.

**A neighbourhood of a point $x$** is any open set containing $x$. The condition
above therefore reads: $U$ is open exactly when every point of $U$ has a ball
around it inside $U$, and it is the balls alone that have to be tested.

**The metric, not the set, determines $\mathcal{T}_d$.** Two metrics on the same
set may have different metric topologies, and two different metrics may have the
same one; the systematic comparison is [[def-equivalent-metrics]].

## Remarks

- **What "topology" means here.** $\mathcal{T}_d$ is defined above as a
  collection of subsets of $X$; the abstract notion of a topological space, a
  collection of subsets closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections
  taken as primitive data, is introduced on a later page and is not used
  here. What is proved
  here is that $\mathcal{T}_d$ has exactly those closure properties
  ([[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]]), which is what licenses the word.
- **Open and closed are not opposites.** A set may be neither ($[0,1)$ inside
  $\mathbb{R}$, once the usual metric is available from
  [[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]) or both ($\emptyset$ and $X$ always, and
  in some spaces every subset at once, as the discrete metric on the companion
  page shows). "Not open" is never a synonym for "closed".
- **Closedness is complementation, and nothing else, at this stage.** The
  description of closed sets by limits of sequences, and the description of the
  closure as an infimum of distances, are theorems proved later on this page
  ([[thm-metric-closure-characterisation]], [[thm-metric-sequential-closure]]),
  not part of the definition.

## Definition

A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ ([[def-topological-space]]) is
**metrizable** if there is a metric $d$ on $X$ ([[def-metric-space]]) whose
metric topology is $\mathcal{T}$, that is $\mathcal{T} = \mathcal{T}_d$
([[def-metric-topology]]). Such a $d$ is said to **induce** or **metrise**
$\mathcal{T}$.

**The definition presupposes that $\mathcal{T}_d$ is a topology in the sense of
[[def-topological-space]], and it is.** By [[def-metric-topology]] both
$\varnothing$ and $X$ are open in $(X,d)$, which is (T1), and by
[[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]] the family $\mathcal{T}_d$ is closed under
arbitrary unions, which is (T2), and under intersections of $n \ge 1$ members,
which contains (T3). So every metric space is a topological space, and the
metric-space development of this library is a special case of the present one.

**The standard local notions in the two developments agree after translating
their neighbourhood conventions.** Let $d$ be a metric on $X$ and give $X$ the
topology $\mathcal{T}_d$.

- *Neighbourhoods and balls.* [[def-metric-topology]] uses "neighbourhood" for
  an open set containing $x$, whereas [[def-neighbourhood-top]] also allows a
  non-open superset of such a set. Thus the two collections are not literally
  equal, but the open metric neighbourhoods are cofinal in the broader
  neighbourhood filter. The balls $B(x,r)$, $r > 0$ ([[def-metric-ball]]), are
  open ([[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]]) and form a neighbourhood base at $x$:
  any neighbourhood $N$ contains an open $U \ni x$, hence a ball around $x$ by
  [[def-metric-topology]]. The balls of radius $1/n$ alone already suffice
  ([[lem-metric-ball-neighbourhood-base]]).
- *Interior, closure, boundary.* [[def-metric-interior-closure-boundary]] defines
  them by the same conditions with balls in place of neighbourhoods, and the
  previous bullet makes the two conditions equivalent; the metric closure is the
  smallest closed superset ([[thm-metric-closure-characterisation]]), which is the
  definition used here ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]). So the two
  closures, the two interiors and the two boundaries are the same three
  operations.
- *Convergence.* $x_k \to p$ in the sense of [[def-sequence-convergence-top]] is
  "eventually in every neighbourhood of $p$", and by the first bullet this is
  "eventually in every ball around $p$", which is [[def-metric-convergence]].
- *Continuity.* $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ continuity at $a$
  ([[def-metric-continuity]]) says that every ball around $f(a)$ has a ball
  around $a$ mapped into it, which by the first bullet is continuity at $a$ in
  the sense of [[def-continuous-map-top]].

- *Subspaces.* For $A \subseteq X$ the subspace topology
  $\{\, U \cap A : U \in \mathcal{T}_d \,\}$ of [[def-subspace-topology-top]] is
  exactly the metric topology of the subspace metric $d_A$
  ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]), so the two uses of the phrase
  *subspace topology* in this library name one thing. Indeed
  $B_A(a,r) = B_X(a,r) \cap A$: a trace $U \cap A$ is $d_A$-open, since each of
  its points $a$ has $B_X(a,r) \subseteq U$ and hence $B_A(a,r) \subseteq U \cap A$;
  and a $d_A$-open $W$ is the trace of
  $U := \bigcup \{\, B_X(a,r) : a \in W,\ r > 0,\ B_X(a,r) \cap A \subseteq W \,\}$,
  which is $d_X$-open, satisfies $U \cap A = W$, and involves no choice principle,
  the union being taken over a set of pairs rather than over a selection.

Consequently the metric-space notions of interior, closure, boundary, density,
convergence, continuity and subspace agree with the topological notions here,
and statements about them transfer once a metric is named. For neighbourhoods
the transfer uses the explicit convention change above: a metric-page
neighbourhood is an open topological neighbourhood, while every topological
neighbourhood contains one.

**Metrizability is a topological property; the metric is not part of it.** If
$h : X \to Y$ is a homeomorphism ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]) and $d$
metrises $X$, then $d'(y_1,y_2) := d(h^{-1}(y_1), h^{-1}(y_2))$ is a metric on
$Y$ — the three axioms transfer along the bijection $h^{-1}$ — and
$h[B_d(x,r)] = B_{d'}(h(x), r)$, so $h$ carries a basis of $\mathcal{T}_d$ to a
basis of $\mathcal{T}_{d'}$ and $\mathcal{T}_{d'} = h[\mathcal{T}_d] = \mathcal{T}_Y$.
Hence $Y$ is metrizable. The metric itself, however, is **not** determined by the
topology: two metrics on one set may induce the same topology without agreeing,
which is exactly topological equivalence ([[def-equivalent-metrics]]), and
properties of a metric that are not properties of its topology, boundedness among
them, are therefore not properties of a metrizable space.

**Two things every metrizable space has.** It is **Hausdorff**: distinct points
have disjoint open neighbourhoods, by [[thm-metric-hausdorff-separation]] applied
to any metric inducing the topology. And it is **first countable**
([[def-first-countable-top]]), by [[lem-metric-ball-neighbourhood-base]]. Either
failure is therefore an obstruction to metrizability, and this page uses the
first of them to exhibit a topology induced by no metric.

**Sequential limits in a metrizable space are unique, so the notation
$\lim_k x_k$ is available there.** In a metric space a sequence has at most one
limit ([[lem-metric-limits-unique]]), and by the agreement of convergence above
that uniqueness is a statement about the topology alone; so within a metrizable
space, and only there, this page writes $\lim_k x_k$ in the ordinary way. In a
general space the symbol is unavailable ([[def-sequence-convergence-top]]).

**The usual topology of $\mathbb{R}$.** The absolute value makes $\mathbb{R}$ a
metric space under $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) = |x-y|$, its open balls are the bounded
open intervals, and the resulting metric topology is what claim 3 of
[[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]] names the **usual topology** of $\mathbb{R}$.
That is the topology meant by the phrase throughout these two pages, and
$\mathbb{R}$ carrying it is metrizable by definition. Every statement about it on
these two pages is proved from the metric $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ and the bridge above,
and no example re-derives any of it.

## Remarks

- **The usual topology of $\mathbb{R}$ is not a second notion alongside the
  order-native development built earlier in this library.**
  [[rem-r-native-topology-scope]] records that the two collections of open subsets
  of $\mathbb{R}$ — the one defined from balls and the one defined from
  order-neighbourhoods — are literally the same collection, and hence that
  interior, closure, boundary, limit point, density and sequential convergence
  agree on the two sides. That identification is quoted here for orientation only;
  the order-topology example on the companion page is where the order-native
  description is used.

- **A metrizable space comes with many metrics and no canonical one.** The
  statement "$X$ is metrizable" asserts existence, and every argument that uses a
  metric must name one first. Where two metrics are compared, the vocabulary is
  that of [[def-equivalent-metrics]]: Lipschitz, uniform and topological
  equivalence, of which only the last is visible to the topology.

- **Metrization theorems are not proved here.** Necessary conditions are easy —
  Hausdorff, first countable — and sufficient ones require separation and
  countability axioms that this page does not develop. Nothing below asserts that
  a space *is* metrizable except by exhibiting a metric.

- **Not every topology is metrizable**, and the cheapest witness is the
  indiscrete topology on a two-point set, which is not Hausdorff. That is
  recorded on this page as a false statement and witnessed on the companion page.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]) and its absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]).

Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ with
$\varepsilon > 0$. The **$\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\},$$

and the **punctured $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \;=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}.$$

The two descriptions of $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ agree because $|y - x| = 0$ holds
exactly when $y = x$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**A neighbourhood is an open interval.** For every $x$ and every
$\varepsilon > 0$,

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;=\; (x - \varepsilon,\ x + \varepsilon),$$

the interval of [[def-interval]]. Indeed [[lem-of-abs-value]] gives, for
$\varepsilon > 0$, the equivalence $|y - x| < \varepsilon \iff -\varepsilon <
y - x < \varepsilon$, and adding $x$ throughout turns the right-hand side into
$x - \varepsilon < y < x + \varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**The centre lies in its own neighbourhoods.** $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, since
$|x - x| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**Punctured neighbourhoods are never empty.** The element
$y := x + \varepsilon/2$ satisfies $|y - x| = \varepsilon/2$, which is
$> 0$ and $< \varepsilon$, so $y \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$
([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

**Monotonicity in the radius.** If $0 < \delta \le \varepsilon$ then
$N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, because $|y - x| < \delta \le
\varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**Nesting at an interior point.** If $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and
$0 < \delta \le \varepsilon - |y - x|$, then

$$N_\delta(y) \;\subseteq\; N_\varepsilon(x).$$

Indeed for $z \in N_\delta(y)$ the triangle inequality
([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]) gives
$|z - x| = |(z - y) + (y - x)| \le |z - y| + |y - x| < \delta + |y - x| \le
\varepsilon$. Note that $\varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ precisely because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, so such a $\delta$ always exists.

## Remarks

- **The radius is a real number, not a rational.** Nothing on this page tests a
  condition against rational radii only. That convention belongs to
  [[def-real-limit]], where the quantifier is over rational $\varepsilon$ and
  the passage between the rational and the real form is the sanctioned remark of
  [[def-sequence]]. Here $\varepsilon$ ranges over the positive reals
  throughout, and every statement above is proved for an arbitrary positive
  real.

- **Why the punctured version is separated out.** A limit point of a set is a
  point every punctured neighbourhood of which meets the set
  ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and deleting the centre is exactly what stops a point
  of the set from qualifying automatically. The unpunctured condition defines
  the weaker notion of an adherent point, and the difference between the two is
  precisely an isolated point.

- **Nesting is the workhorse.** Almost every openness verification on this page
  has the shape "given $y$ in the set, shrink the radius by the distance
  already travelled", which is the nesting property above. It is recorded here
  once so that no later proof has to redo the triangle inequality in passing.

## Definition

Let $U, F \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]].

- $U$ is **open** when for every $x \in U$ there is a real $\varepsilon > 0$
  with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$.
- $F$ is **closed** when its complement $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open.
- A set is **clopen** when it is both open and closed.

The whole of the topology of $\mathbb{R}$ developed on this page rests on this
one definition: closedness is *defined* as openness of the complement, and every
other description of a closed set on this page is a theorem
([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]]).

**$\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen.** The condition defining openness
quantifies over the elements of the set, so it holds vacuously for
$\varnothing$; and for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ one has $N_1(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$,
so $\mathbb{R}$ is open. Since each of the two is the complement of the other,
each is also closed.

**Every neighbourhood is open.** Let $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and put
$\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x|$, which is $> 0$ because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$. The nesting property of [[def-neighbourhood-r]] gives
$N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$. So every point of $N_\varepsilon(x)$
has a neighbourhood inside it.

**The four open forms of [[def-interval]] are open sets.** Let $a, b \in
\mathbb{R}$.

- $(a,b)$: for $x$ with $a < x < b$, both $x - a > 0$ and $b - x > 0$, so
  $\delta := \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ is a positive real (the minimum of a
  two-element set of reals exists, [[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).
  If $|y - x| < \delta$ then $y > x - \delta \ge x - (x - a) = a$ and
  $y < x + \delta \le x + (b - x) = b$, so $y \in (a,b)$; hence
  $N_\delta(x) \subseteq (a,b)$.
- $(a,\infty)$: for $x > a$ take $\delta := x - a > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y > x - \delta = a$.
- $(-\infty,b)$: for $x < b$ take $\delta := b - x > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y < x + \delta = b$.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: already treated above.

**The four closed forms of [[def-interval]] are closed sets.** In each case the
complement is shown open directly.

- $[a,b]$: if $x \notin [a,b]$ then $x < a$ or $x > b$ by trichotomy
  ([[def-ordered-field]]). If $x < a$, take $\delta := a - x > 0$; every
  $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has $y < x + \delta = a$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. If
  $x > b$, take $\delta := x - b > 0$; every $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has
  $y > x - \delta = b$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. So
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus [a,b]$ is open.
- $[a,\infty)$: its complement is $(-\infty,a)$, which is open by the previous
  paragraph.
- $(-\infty,b]$: its complement is $(b,\infty)$, which is open.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: its complement is $\varnothing$, which is
  open.

## Remarks

- **Open and closed are not opposites, and not exhaustive.** A set may be
  neither: the half-open interval $[0,1)$ is neither open nor closed
  ([[fs-every-set-is-open-or-closed]]). A set may be both: $\varnothing$ and
  $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen. The words are inherited from the interval terminology
  of [[def-interval]], and the agreement between the two usages is exactly the
  two lists verified above: an interval called open there is an open set here,
  and an interval called closed there is a closed set here.

- **A clopen set is a disconnection waiting to happen.** If $A$ is clopen and
  both $A$ and $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ are nonempty, then each of the two is
  its own closure, so the two are separated in the sense of
  [[def-connected-r]] and $\mathbb{R} = A \cup (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)$ is a
  disconnection. Since $\mathbb{R}$ is order-convex it is connected
  ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]]), so no such $A$ exists:
  $\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are the only clopen subsets of $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The half-open forms are the ones the two lists omit**, and deliberately so:
  $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ with $a < b$ are neither open nor closed as subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The radius depends on the point.** Openness asks for *some* $\varepsilon$
  at each point, and that $\varepsilon$ may shrink to nothing as the point
  approaches the edge of the set, as the computation for $(a,b)$ shows: there
  $\delta = \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ tends to $0$ as $x$ tends to either endpoint.
  Asking instead for a single $\varepsilon$ that works simultaneously at every
  point of the set is a strictly stronger condition, and it is not what is
  defined here; nothing on this page uses it.

## Definition

Let $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with open sets as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

- An **open cover** of $K$ is a family $\mathcal{U}$ of open subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$ with $K \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{U}$.
- A **subcover** of $\mathcal{U}$ is a subfamily $\mathcal{V} \subseteq
  \mathcal{U}$ that is still an open cover of $K$.
- A subfamily $\mathcal{V} \subseteq \mathcal{U}$ is **finite** when
  $\mathcal{V} = \varnothing$ or there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and members
  $U_0, \dots, U_n$ of $\mathcal{U}$ with $\mathcal{V} = \{U_0, \dots, U_n\}$;
  repetitions in the list are allowed and harmless.
- $K$ is **compact** when every open cover of $K$ has a finite subcover:
  for every open cover $\mathcal{U}$ of $K$, either $K = \varnothing$ and the
  empty subfamily covers it, or there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
  $U_0, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{U}$ with
  $$K \subseteq U_0 \cup \dots \cup U_n .$$
- $K$ is **sequentially compact** when every sequence $(x_k)$ of reals with
  $x_k \in K$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-sequence]]) has a subsequence
  converging ([[def-real-limit]]) to some point of $K$; equivalently, when every
  such sequence has a subsequential limit ([[def-subsequential-limit]]) that
  lies in $K$.

**Compactness is a property of $K$ alone.** The covering families range over open
subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, not over sets open in some other ambient space, so the
notion defined here is compactness of $K$ as a subset of $\mathbb{R}$. Nothing
below relativises it to a smaller ambient field; where an ordered field other
than $\mathbb{R}$ is meant, as in
[[fs-closed-bounded-compact-without-completeness]], the whole vocabulary is set
up again there for that field.

**$\varnothing$ is compact and sequentially compact.** The empty subfamily covers
it, and there is no sequence with all terms in $\varnothing$, so both conditions
hold vacuously.

## Remarks

- **Why "finite" is spelled out by listing.** A finite subfamily is described
  here as one that can be written $\{U_0, \dots, U_n\}$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}$,
  which is exactly the form every proof on this page produces or consumes: the
  bisection argument of [[thm-heine-borel-r]] produces a one-member list, and
  the arguments of [[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]] consume a list by
  taking a maximum over it ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]). Since $\mathbb{N}$
  contains $0$, the shortest nonempty list is $\{U_0\}$.

- **The two notions are not defined to be equivalent, and their equivalence is a
  theorem.** For subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ it is
  [[thm-compact-iff-sequentially-compact-r]]; both of its implications run
  through the characterisation of compactness by closed and bounded, and its
  forward implication additionally uses Bolzano-Weierstrass. Neither implication
  is formal.

- **Compactness is not inherited by subsets, but by closed subsets.** A closed
  subset of a compact set is compact, which is immediate from
  [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]] once that is available, whereas
  $(0,1) \subseteq [0,1]$ shows that an arbitrary subset of a compact set need
  not be compact.

- **The empty cover.** If $K \ne \varnothing$ then no open cover of $K$ is
  empty, so the case distinction in the definition of compactness only ever
  matters for $K = \varnothing$; it is written out so that the definition does
  not quietly assume $K$ nonempty.

## Definition

Let $X$ be a set and write $\mathcal{P}(X)$ for its power set. A **topology** on
$X$ is a family $\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ such that

- **(T1)** $\varnothing \in \mathcal{T}$ and $X \in \mathcal{T}$;
- **(T2)** $\bigcup \mathcal{S} \in \mathcal{T}$ for every $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$;
- **(T3)** $U \cap V \in \mathcal{T}$ for all $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$.

A **topological space** is a pair $(X, \mathcal{T})$ consisting of a set $X$ and
a topology $\mathcal{T}$ on it; the elements of $X$ are its **points**. When only
one topology is in play we write $X$ for the pair; when several are, the topology
is always named.

The members of $\mathcal{T}$ are the **open** sets of $(X,\mathcal{T})$. A subset
$F \subseteq X$ is **closed** when its complement $X \setminus F$ is open, and
**clopen** when it is both open and closed. By (T1) both $\varnothing$ and $X$
are clopen. *Open and closed are not opposites*: a set may be neither, and it may
be both, so "not open" is never a synonym for "closed".

**Finite intersections, and the empty one.** Axiom (T3) is stated for two sets
because that is all that is ever needed: if $n \ge 1$ and
$U_1, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{T}$, then $U_1 \cap \dots \cap U_n \in \mathcal{T}$
follows by iterating (T3) $n-1$ times. The intersection of the **empty** family
of subsets of $X$ is $X$, since the condition "lies in every member of the empty
family" is vacuous; that case is covered by (T1) rather than by (T3), which is
one of the two reasons $X \in \mathcal{T}$ is demanded outright. The other is
that (T2) alone gives only $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$.

**The closed sets, and the dual axiomatisation.** Put
$\mathcal{C} := \{\, X \setminus U : U \in \mathcal{T} \,\}$, the family of closed
sets. Then

- **(C1)** $\varnothing \in \mathcal{C}$ and $X \in \mathcal{C}$;
- **(C2)** $\bigcap \mathcal{D} \in \mathcal{C}$ for every **nonempty**
  $\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$;
- **(C3)** $C \cup D \in \mathcal{C}$ for all $C, D \in \mathcal{C}$.

Conversely, if a family $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ satisfies (C1),
(C2) and (C3), then $\mathcal{T} := \{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{C} \,\}$
is a topology on $X$ whose closed sets are exactly the members of $\mathcal{C}$.
So a topology may be presented equally well by its open sets or by its closed
sets, and this library uses whichever is shorter.

*Both directions are one computation, and it is carried out here rather than
assumed.* The map $U \mapsto X \setminus U$ is an involution of
$\mathcal{P}(X)$, hence a bijection, and it carries the two De Morgan identities

$$X \setminus \bigcup_{i \in I} A_i = \bigcap_{i \in I} (X \setminus A_i) \quad (I \ne \varnothing), \qquad X \setminus \bigcap_{i \in I} A_i = \bigcup_{i \in I} (X \setminus A_i) \quad (I \ne \varnothing)$$

term by term into each other. Given (T1)–(T3): $\varnothing = X \setminus X$ and
$X = X \setminus \varnothing$ lie in $\mathcal{C}$, which is (C1); for nonempty
$\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$ the family
$\mathcal{S} = \{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{D} \,\}$ lies in $\mathcal{T}$
and $\bigcap \mathcal{D} = X \setminus \bigcup \mathcal{S}$ is closed by (T2),
which is (C2); and $C \cup D = X \setminus ((X \setminus C) \cap (X \setminus D))$
is closed by (T3), which is (C3). Given (C1)–(C3) the same three lines run
backwards, the empty-union case $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$ being supplied
by (C1) rather than by (C2); and $\{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{C} \,\}$ has
$\mathcal{C}$ as its family of complements because complementation is an
involution.

**Comparison of topologies.** If $\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ are
topologies on the same set $X$ and $\mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2$, then
$\mathcal{T}_1$ is **coarser** than $\mathcal{T}_2$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ is
**finer** than $\mathcal{T}_1$; the comparison is **strict** when the inclusion
is. Inclusion is a partial order on the set of topologies on $X$
([[def-partial-order]]), and it is not a total one: two topologies on the same
set may be incomparable.

## Remarks

- **The topology is part of the data.** Two different topologies on one set are
  two different topological spaces, exactly as two different metrics on one set
  are two different metric spaces. Every statement below that says "the space
  $X$" has a topology fixed in advance.

- **Nothing is assumed beyond (T1)–(T3).** In particular no separation property
  is built into the word *space* here: distinct points need not lie in disjoint
  open sets, singletons need not be closed, and both failures occur in the
  standard topologies defined on the next item. Where a separation property is
  used it is stated as a hypothesis.

- **This library always writes *coarser* and *finer*.** The synonyms
  *smaller/larger* are unambiguous, but *weaker/stronger* is used in both
  directions in the literature and is avoided here entirely.

- **Why "arbitrary unions, finite intersections" and not the reverse.** The
  asymmetry is not a convention: it is what makes the metric notion of open set
  ([[def-metric-topology]]) an instance, and an arbitrary intersection of open
  sets genuinely need not be open. The failure is recorded on this page as a
  false statement, with witnesses in two different spaces.

## Statement

**False claim:** boundedness is a topological property of a metric space; that
is, if $d$ and $d'$ are topologically equivalent metrics on a set $X$
([[def-equivalent-metrics]]) and $(X,d)$ is a bounded metric space
([[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]), then $(X,d')$ is bounded as well.

Equivalently, the false claim says that the metric topology
([[def-metric-topology]]) determines whether the space is bounded. It does not:
every metric space carries a bounded metric with exactly the same topology, so
as soon as one unbounded metric space exists the claim collapses.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The real line $\mathbb{R}$ with its usual metric $d_{\mathbb{R}}(u,v) = |u-v|$, and the metric $\rho(u,v) := \min\{\, d_{\mathbb{R}}(u,v),\ 1 \,\}$ ([[def-max-min]]).

[L1] $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ is a metric on $\mathbb{R}$ and $(\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$ is not a bounded metric space: no ball contains $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]], [[def-metric-space]]).

[L2] For any metric $d$ the function $\min\{d,1\}$ is a metric, is bounded with diameter at most $1$ on a nonempty space, and is uniformly equivalent to $d$ ([[lem-bounded-remetrisation]], [[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]).

[L3] Uniform equivalence implies topological equivalence ([[thm-metric-equivalence-hierarchy]], [[def-equivalent-metrics]]).

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L1] the metric $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ makes $\mathbb{R}$ a metric space that is not bounded. [L1]

1.2 By [L2] the function $\rho = \min\{d_{\mathbb{R}}, 1\}$ is a metric on $\mathbb{R}$, the space $(\mathbb{R}, \rho)$ is bounded with $\operatorname{diam}(\mathbb{R}) \le 1$, and $\rho$ is uniformly equivalent to $d_{\mathbb{R}}$. [L2]

2.1 By [L3] the two metrics are therefore topologically equivalent: $\mathcal{T}_\rho = \mathcal{T}_{d_{\mathbb{R}}}$. [step 1.2, L3]

3.1 So $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ and $\rho$ are topologically equivalent metrics on the same set, $(\mathbb{R},\rho)$ is bounded and $(\mathbb{R},d_{\mathbb{R}})$ is not; the claim fails, and boundedness is a property of the metric and not of the topology. [step 1.1, step 2.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **What is true instead.** Boundedness is preserved by Lipschitz equivalence,
  since $d' \le \beta d$ turns a ball for $d$ into a ball for $d'$
  ([[def-equivalent-metrics]]). It is the two weaker equivalences that lose it,
  and the witness above sits precisely in the gap between Lipschitz equivalence
  and uniform equivalence ([[thm-metric-equivalence-hierarchy]]).
- **The diameter is even less topological than boundedness.** Rescaling a metric
  by a positive constant is a Lipschitz equivalence and multiplies every
  diameter by that constant, so no numerical value of the diameter is determined
  even by the Lipschitz class.
- **This is why "bounded" is never used as a topological adjective in this
  library.** The bounded subsets of $(X,d)$ are defined from $d$
  ([[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]), and every statement about them names the
  metric.

## Statement

**False claim:** in every ordered field $F$ ([[def-ordered-field]]), a subset of
$F$ that is closed in $F$ and bounded is compact in $F$; consequently the
completeness hypothesis in [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]] is
unnecessary.

**How the claim must be read.** It speaks of an arbitrary ordered field, so the
whole vocabulary has to be available there, and it is: for $x \in F$ and
$\varepsilon \in F$ with $\varepsilon > 0$ put
$N^{F}_\varepsilon(x) := \{\, y \in F : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}$, using the
absolute value of [[def-abs-value]], which is defined in every ordered field;
call $U \subseteq F$ **open in $F$** when every $x \in U$ admits
$\varepsilon > 0$ in $F$ with $N^{F}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$, call
$C \subseteq F$ **closed in $F$** when $F \setminus C$ is open in $F$, call
$S \subseteq F$ **bounded** when some $\ell, u \in F$ satisfy $\ell \le s \le u$
for all $s \in S$, and call $S$ **compact in $F$** when every family of sets open
in $F$ whose union contains $S$ has a finite subfamily whose union already
contains $S$. These are the definitions of [[def-neighbourhood-r]],
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-bounded-set]] and [[def-open-cover-r]]
transposed word for word from $\mathbb{R}$ to $F$; with $F = \mathbb{R}$ they are
literally those definitions.

The refutation takes $F = \mathbb{Q}$ ([[def-rationals]],
[[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and the set of nonnegative rationals whose square is
below $2$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The ordered field $\mathbb{Q}$ and the set $S := \{\, q \in \mathbb{Q} : q \ge 0 \text{ and } q^2 < 2 \,\}$, together with the notions "open in $\mathbb{Q}$", "closed in $\mathbb{Q}$", "bounded" and "compact in $\mathbb{Q}$" as set out in the Statement. Here $2 := 1 + 1$ and $4 := 2 \cdot 2$ in $\mathbb{Q}$.

[A1] The false claim: in every ordered field, a closed bounded subset is compact.

[L1] $\mathbb{Q}$ is a field and the relation of its order makes it a totally ordered field: the order is total and transitive, adding a constant preserves it, and a product of positives is positive ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]], [[thm-rat-field]], [[def-rationals]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Absolute value in an ordered field: $|z| \ge 0$; $|z| = z$ for $z \ge 0$ and $|z| = -z$ for $z < 0$; and for $c > 0$ one has $|z| < c$ exactly when $-c < z < c$ ([[def-abs-value]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L3] No rational number squares to $2$ ([[fs-sqrt2-rational]]).

[L4] In an ordered field, squaring is strictly monotone on the nonnegatives: $0 \le a < b$ implies $a^2 < b^2$, and $0 \le a \le b$ implies $a^2 \le b^2$ ([[lem-of-square-monotone]]).

[L5] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, hence $0 < 2 < 4$ and $2 \ne 0$; a positive element has a positive inverse; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve an inequality ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $S$ is nonempty and bounded: $1 \in S$ because $1 \ge 0$ and $1^2 = 1 < 2$ by [L5]; and every $q \in S$ satisfies $0 \le q < 2$, since $q \ge 2 \ge 0$ would give $q^2 \ge 2^2 = 4 > 2$ by [L4] and [L5], contradicting $q^2 < 2$. [L1, L4, L5]

1.2 $S$ has no greatest element: let $q \in S$ and put $h := \min\{\, 1,\ (2 - q^2)(2q+2)^{-1} \,\}$, a definition by cases on the total order of $\mathbb{Q}$; here $2q + 2 > 0$ because $q \ge 0$, and $2 - q^2 > 0$, so both entries are positive and $h > 0$ with $h \le 1$. Put $r := q + h$, so $r > q \ge 0$. Then $h^2 \le h$ because $0 < h \le 1$, and $h(2q+1) \le (2-q^2)(2q+1)(2q+2)^{-1} < 2 - q^2$ because $(2q+1)(2q+2)^{-1} < 1$ and $2 - q^2 > 0$; hence $r^2 = q^2 + 2qh + h^2 \le q^2 + h(2q+1) < q^2 + (2 - q^2) = 2$, so $r \in S$ and $q < r$. [L1, L4, L5]

1.3 $S$ is closed in $\mathbb{Q}$: let $q \in \mathbb{Q} \setminus S$, so $q < 0$, or $q \ge 0$ and $q^2 \ge 2$, in which case $q^2 \ne 2$ by [L3] gives $q^2 > 2$. If $q < 0$, put $\varepsilon := -q > 0$; every $y$ with $|y - q| < \varepsilon$ satisfies $y < q + \varepsilon = 0$ by [L2], hence $y \notin S$. If $q \ge 0$ and $q^2 > 2$, then $q \ne 0$ since $0^2 = 0 < 2$, so $q > 0$; put $\varepsilon := \min\{\, q,\ (q^2 - 2)(2q)^{-1} \,\} > 0$, again a definition by cases. Every $y$ with $|y - q| < \varepsilon$ satisfies $y > q - \varepsilon \ge 0$, so $y^2 > (q - \varepsilon)^2$ by [L4], and $(q-\varepsilon)^2 = q^2 - 2q\varepsilon + \varepsilon^2 \ge q^2 - 2q\varepsilon \ge q^2 - (q^2 - 2) = 2$, whence $y^2 > 2$ and $y \notin S$. In both cases a neighbourhood of $q$ misses $S$, so $\mathbb{Q} \setminus S$ is open in $\mathbb{Q}$. [L1, L2, L3, L4, L5]

1.4 For $r \in S$ put $B_r := \{\, y \in \mathbb{Q} : y < r \,\}$; each $B_r$ is open in $\mathbb{Q}$, since $y \in B_r$ and $\varepsilon := r - y > 0$ give, for every $z$ with $|z - y| < \varepsilon$, the inequality $z < y + \varepsilon = r$ by [L2]. [given, L1, L2]

2.1 The family $\mathcal{U} := \{\, B_r : r \in S \,\}$ is a cover of $S$ by sets open in $\mathbb{Q}$: given $q \in S$, step 1.2 supplies $r \in S$ with $q < r$, so $q \in B_r$. [step 1.2, step 1.4, L1]

2.2 $\mathcal{U}$ has no finite subfamily covering $S$: the empty subfamily fails because $S \ne \varnothing$ by step 1.1; and a nonempty finite subfamily is $\{B_{r_0}, \dots, B_{r_p}\}$ with every $r_i \in S$, so an induction on $p$ using the totality of the order of $\mathbb{Q}$ produces $R := \max\{r_0, \dots, r_p\}$, one of the $r_i$ and hence a member of $S$; for each $i$ one has $r_i \le R$, so $R < r_i$ fails and $R \notin B_{r_i}$. Thus the element $R$ of $S$ lies in no member of the subfamily. [step 1.1, step 1.4, L1]

3.1 The set $S$ is bounded by step 1.1 and closed in $\mathbb{Q}$ by step 1.3, and by steps 2.1 and 2.2 it is not compact in $\mathbb{Q}$, while $\mathbb{Q}$ is an ordered field by [L1]. So the claim [A1] fails at $F = \mathbb{Q}$ and is false. [step 1.1, step 1.3, step 2.1, step 2.2, A1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the false claim gets wrong.** [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]]
  has two halves of very different strengths. The half that a compact set is
  closed and bounded ([[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]]) uses no
  completeness at all, only the Archimedean property and the existence of maxima
  of finite sets. The converse half is
  the one that rests on completeness, through [[thm-heine-borel-r]] and the
  nested interval property, and it is exactly the half refuted above.

- **Where the missing point is.** The cover of step 2.1 creeps up on a bound that
  $\mathbb{Q}$ does not contain. In $\mathbb{R}$ that bound exists, namely
  $\sqrt 2$ ([[thm-of-square-roots]]), and it is not rational
  ([[fs-sqrt2-rational]]); the set $S$ is thus closed in $\mathbb{Q}$ precisely
  because the point that would have to be adjoined to close it is absent from
  $\mathbb{Q}$. Read inside $\mathbb{R}$, the same set of numbers is bounded and
  not closed, and it is not compact there either.

- **This is a statement about ordered fields, and it is refuted in that
  generality.** One counterexample field suffices to refute a claim about every
  ordered field, and $\mathbb{Q}$ is the smallest one available here. Nothing
  above uses any ordered-field lemma outside its stated generality: [L2], [L4]
  and [L5] are all proved for an arbitrary ordered field, and the results of this
  page that are stated for $\mathbb{R}$ only are not applied to $\mathbb{Q}$.

- **The named witness** is [[cex-closed-bounded-in-q-not-compact]]; the
  refutation is carried out here.

## Statement

Let $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be compact ([[def-open-cover-r]]). Then $K$ is
closed ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) and bounded ([[def-bounded-set]]).

Two covers do the work, and they use the Archimedean property in its two
different forms. Boundedness is read off the cover of $\mathbb{R}$ by the
intervals $(-n,n)$, which needs the **cofinal** form, that the canonical naturals
exceed every real ([[thm-of-archimedean]]). Closedness is read off the cover of
$K$, for a point $x$ outside it, by the sets
$\{\, y : |y - x| > 1/n \,\}$, which needs the **reciprocal** form, that the
reciprocals of the naturals get below every positive real
([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]]); the cofinal form alone does not deliver it.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A compact set $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Throughout, $n$ denotes both a natural number $\ge 1$ and the canonical natural $n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ of $\mathbb{R}$, as is standard.

[L1] Open cover, finite subfamily and compactness: every open cover of $K$ has a subcover that is empty or of the form $\{U_0, \dots, U_p\}$ with $p \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L2] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; $K$ is closed when $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$ is open; each of the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$, $\mathbb{R}$ is an open set ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L3] $N_\varepsilon(x) = \{\, y : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L4] $K$ is bounded when there are $\ell, u$ with $\ell \le y \le u$ for every $y \in K$ ([[def-bounded-set]]).

[L5] Archimedean property, cofinal form: for every $z \in \mathbb{R}$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $z < n$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]]).

[L6] Archimedean property, reciprocal form: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]]).

[L7] Absolute value: $|z| \ge 0$, $|z| \ge z$, $|z| \ge -z$, and $|z| = 0$ exactly when $z = 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L8] Triangle inequality: $|p + q| \le |p| + |q|$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L9] Every nonempty finite set of reals has a maximum, which is one of its members ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L10] Canonical naturals: $n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ and $m \le n$ in $\mathbb{N}$ gives $m \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} \le n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]); reciprocation of positives reverses the order ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]); the order is total and transitive ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For each natural $n \ge 1$ put $W_n := (-n, n)$, an open set by [L2]. The family $\{\, W_n : n \ge 1 \,\}$ covers $\mathbb{R}$, hence covers $K$: given $y \in \mathbb{R}$, [L5] supplies $n \ge 1$ with $|y| < n$, and then $y \le |y| < n$ and $-y \le |y| < n$ by [L7], so $-n < y < n$. [L2, L5, L7]

1.2 Let $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus K$ and for each natural $n \ge 1$ put $V_n := \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : |y - x| > 1/n \,\}$, which is defined because $n > 0$ has a positive inverse by [L10]. Each $V_n$ is open: given $y \in V_n$, put $\delta := |y - x| - 1/n > 0$; for $z \in N_\delta(y)$ the triangle inequality [L8] gives $|y - x| = |(y - z) + (z - x)| \le |y - z| + |z - x| < \delta + |z - x|$, whence $|z - x| > |y - x| - \delta = 1/n$ and $z \in V_n$. The family $\{\, V_n : n \ge 1 \,\}$ covers $K$: for $y \in K$ one has $y \ne x$, so $|y - x| > 0$ by [L7], and [L6] supplies $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < |y - x|$, that is $y \in V_n$. [L3, L6, L7, L8, L10]

2.1 Apply compactness to the cover of step 1.1. If the finite subcover is empty then $K = \varnothing$ and $-1 \le y \le 1$ holds vacuously for $y \in K$; otherwise there are naturals $n_0, \dots, n_p \ge 1$ with $K \subseteq W_{n_0} \cup \dots \cup W_{n_p}$, and putting $N := \max\{n_0, \dots, n_p\}$ by [L9] we get $W_{n_i} \subseteq W_N$ for each $i$, since $n_i \le N$ gives $-N \le -n_i$ and $n_i \le N$ in $\mathbb{R}$ by [L10]. Hence $K \subseteq W_N = (-N,N)$ and $-N \le y \le N$ for every $y \in K$, so $K$ is bounded. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L4, L9, L10]

2.2 Apply compactness to the cover of step 1.2. If the finite subcover is empty then $K = \varnothing$ and $|y - x| > 1$ holds vacuously for $y \in K$, so take $M := 1$; otherwise there are naturals $n_0, \dots, n_p \ge 1$ with $K \subseteq V_{n_0} \cup \dots \cup V_{n_p}$, and putting $M := \max\{n_0, \dots, n_p\}$ by [L9] we get $V_{n_i} \subseteq V_M$ for each $i$, since $n_i \le M$ gives $0 < 1/M \le 1/n_i$ by [L10]. In both cases $K \subseteq V_M$, that is, $|y - x| > 1/M$ for every $y \in K$. [step 1.2, L1, L9, L10]

3.1 Consequently $N_{1/M}(x) \cap K = \varnothing$, since $y \in K$ has $|y - x| > 1/M$ while $y \in N_{1/M}(x)$ would give $|y - x| < 1/M$, which trichotomy forbids; so $N_{1/M}(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus K$. As $x$ was an arbitrary point of $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$, that complement is open and $K$ is closed. [step 2.2, L2, L3, L10]

4.1 $K$ is bounded by step 2.1 and closed by step 3.1, which is the assertion. [step 2.1, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the reciprocal form is unavoidable in step 1.2.** The sets covering $K$
  must exhaust the complement of the single point $x$, and the natural way to do
  that with open sets is to exclude a shrinking closed neighbourhood of $x$. The
  radii of those neighbourhoods have to become smaller than $|y - x|$ for each
  $y \in K$, and that is exactly the statement of
  [[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]]. The cofinal form [[thm-of-archimedean]] says
  the naturals get large, which is what step 1.1 needs and is a different
  assertion; the corollary exists in this library precisely so that the
  inversion between them is done once.

- **The converse needs completeness and this lemma does not.** Nothing above
  uses the least-upper-bound property except through the Archimedean property;
  beyond the ordered-field axioms the proof asks only for that property and for
  the existence of a maximum of a finite set. The converse, that a closed bounded
  set is compact, is false in $\mathbb{Q}$
  ([[fs-closed-bounded-compact-without-completeness]]) and true in $\mathbb{R}$
  ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]]).

- **Neither conclusion can be strengthened to an equivalence on its own.** A
  closed set need not be compact and a bounded set need not be compact, and both
  failures are recorded in [[cex-unbounded-closed-set-not-compact]].

## Statement

Define $d_{\mathbb{R}} : \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ by
$d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) := |x - y|$ ([[def-abs-value]]). Then:

1. $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ is a metric on $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-metric-space]]); it is
   called the **usual metric** of $\mathbb{R}$.
2. For $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and $r > 0$ the open ball is the bounded open interval
   ([[def-interval]], [[def-metric-ball]])
   $$B(x,r) = (x-r,\ x+r),$$
   and the closed ball is $\bar B(x,r) = [x-r,\ x+r]$.
3. Consequently $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is open in the metric topology of
   $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-metric-topology]]) exactly when for every $x \in U$
   there is $r > 0$ with $(x-r, x+r) \subseteq U$. This topology is called the
   **usual topology** of $\mathbb{R}$.
4. $(\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$ is not a bounded metric space
   ([[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]): no ball contains $\mathbb{R}$, so
   $\operatorname{diam}(\mathbb{R})$ is not defined.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The complete ordered field $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]), and the function $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) = |x-y|$; points $x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}$ and a real $r > 0$.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| \ge 0$; $|u| = 0$ if and only if $u = 0$; $|-u| = |u|$; and for $c > 0$ one has $|u| < c$ if and only if $-c < u < c$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Triangle inequality in an ordered field: $|u + v| \le |u| + |v|$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L3] Intervals: $(a,b) = \{t : a < t < b\}$ and $[a,b] = \{t : a \le t \le b\}$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L4] Archimedean property: for every $w \in \mathbb{R}$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $w < n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); and $n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L5] Adding a constant to an inequality, in strict and nonstrict form: the strict form is [[lem-of-add-order]] and the nonstrict form is that together with the case of equality, the order being total ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L6] Trichotomy: for reals $a,b$ exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Separation (M1): $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) = |x-y| = 0$ holds if and only if $x - y = 0$, that is if and only if $x = y$. [L1]

1.2 Symmetry (M2): $d_{\mathbb{R}}(y,x) = |y-x| = |-(x-y)| = |x-y| = d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y)$. [L1]

1.3 Triangle inequality (M3): $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,z) = |x - z| = |(x-y) + (y-z)| \le |x-y| + |y-z| = d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) + d_{\mathbb{R}}(y,z)$. [L2]

1.4 For $y \in \mathbb{R}$ and $r > 0$: $y \in B(x,r)$ means $|x - y| < r$, which by [L1] holds if and only if $-r < x - y < r$, and adding $y - r$ respectively $y + r$ to the two halves shows this is equivalent to $x - r < y < x + r$. [L1, L5]

1.5 For $y \in \mathbb{R}$ and $r > 0$: $y \in \bar B(x,r)$ means $|x-y| \le r$, which by the same equivalence read with $\le$ in place of $<$ holds if and only if $x - r \le y \le x + r$. [L1, L5]

1.6 Let $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ and $r > 0$ be arbitrary, and use [L4] to fix a natural $n \ge 1$ with $x_0 + r < n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$; write $w := n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$. [L4, choose]

2.1 By steps 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 the function $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ satisfies (M1), (M2) and (M3), so it is a metric on $\mathbb{R}$, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3]

2.2 By step 1.4 and [L3] the set $B(x,r)$ has exactly the elements of $(x-r,x+r)$, and by step 1.5 and [L3] the set $\bar B(x,r)$ has exactly the elements of $[x-r,x+r]$; this is claim 2. [step 1.4, step 1.5, L3]

2.3 Since $r > 0$ we have $x_0 < x_0 + r < w$, so $w - x_0 > r > 0$ and hence $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x_0, w) = |x_0 - w| = |-(w - x_0)| = w - x_0 > r$; therefore $w \notin B(x_0,r)$. [step 1.6, L1, L5, L6]

3.1 Substituting claim 2 into the definition of open in the metric topology gives claim 3: $U$ is open exactly when every $x \in U$ admits $r > 0$ with $(x-r,x+r) = B(x,r) \subseteq U$. [step 2.2]

4.1 Since $x_0$ and $r$ were arbitrary, step 2.3 exhibits for every ball $B(x_0,r)$ a real not in it, so no ball contains $\mathbb{R}$; hence $\mathbb{R}$ is not a bounded subset of itself and $\operatorname{diam}(\mathbb{R})$ is not defined, which is claim 4. [step 2.1, step 2.3] ∎

## Remarks

- **This is the metric every later ceiling rests on.** Every real-line example on the companion page, and every subspace of $\mathbb{R}$ used there, takes its metric from $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ through the subspace construction of [[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]].
- **Unboundedness needs no Archimedean input, and no completeness either.** No ordered field is bounded under $d(u,v) = |u-v|$, and the reason is a single element rather than any cofinality property: given a centre $c$ and a radius $r > 0$, the element $c + r + 1$ satisfies $d(c,\, c + r + 1) = |{-(r+1)}| = r + 1 > r$, because $1 > 0$ and $r + 1 > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]]); so it lies outside $B(c,r)$ and no ball contains the field. Step 1.6 above chooses its witness with [[thm-of-archimedean]] instead, which is a convenience and not a necessity: it delivers a witness that is a canonical natural, and claim 4 needs no such thing. Claim 4 therefore holds verbatim in every ordered field with this $d$, Archimedean or not. Note also that a radius is an element of $\mathbb{R}$, so "a ball of infinite radius" is not something that can be written here.
- **The claim that $\operatorname{diam}(\mathbb{R})$ is "not defined" is a claim about the conventions of this development** ([[rem-sup-conventions]], [[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]): suprema here are real numbers and the extended real line, which is introduced on a later page, is not used for them, so an unbounded set has no diameter at all rather than a diameter $+\infty$.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}$, with closure as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]] and sequences and convergence as in
[[def-sequence]] and [[def-real-limit]]. Then

$$x \in \overline{A} \iff \text{there is a sequence } (a_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \text{ with } a_k \in A \text{ for every } k \text{ and } a_k \to x .$$

Consequently $A$ is closed if and only if it is **sequentially closed**: whenever
a sequence with all its terms in $A$ converges, its limit lies in $A$.

**The right-to-left direction is choice free; the left-to-right direction spends
$\mathrm{AC}_\omega$** ([[def-countable-choice]]). Producing a sequence from a
point of the closure requires selecting one point of $A$ from each of the
countably many sets $N_{1/(k+1)}(x) \cap A$, and this library has no canonical
rule for that selection, so the axiom of countable choice is invoked
explicitly at step 2.2 and nowhere else.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a real $x$. Sequences are functions on $\mathbb{N}$, which contains $0$, so a sequence is $(a_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ and the radii used below are $1/(k+1)$ rather than $1/k$ ([[def-sequence]]).

[L1] $\overline{A}$ is exactly the set of adherent points of $A$, that is, of points every neighbourhood of which meets $A$; and $A$ is closed exactly when $A = \overline{A}$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L2] $N_\varepsilon(x) = \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}$ for real $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L3] $(a_k) \to x$ means: for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|a_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$ ([[def-real-limit]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L4] Strictly between any two reals lies a rational; in particular for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a rational $q$ with $0 < q < \varepsilon$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L5] Reciprocal Archimedean property: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]]).

[L6] Canonical naturals: $n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ and $m \le n$ in $\mathbb{N}$ gives $m \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} \le n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]); a positive element has a positive inverse and $0 < a \le b$ gives $0 < 1/b \le 1/a$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

[L7] Countable choice: for every family $(X_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of nonempty sets there is a function $f$ with domain $\mathbb{N}$ such that $f(k) \in X_k$ for every $k$ ([[def-countable-choice]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For the right-to-left implication, assume $a_k \in A$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and $a_k \to x$, and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real. [assume-hyp, L3]

1.2 For the left-to-right implication, assume $x \in \overline{A}$; then for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ the radius $1/(k+1)$ is a positive real and the set $X_k := N_{1/(k+1)}(x) \cap A$ is nonempty, because $x$ is an adherent point of $A$ by [L1]. [assume-hyp, L1, L2, L6]

2.1 Fix a rational $q$ with $0 < q < \varepsilon$ by [L4], and then $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|a_k - x| < q$ for all $k \ge K$ by [L3]; in particular $|a_K - x| < q < \varepsilon$, so $a_K \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ and that intersection is nonempty. As $\varepsilon$ was an arbitrary positive real, $x$ is an adherent point of $A$, hence $x \in \overline{A}$ by [L1]. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L3, L4, choose]

2.2 Apply [L7] to the family $(X_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of step 1.2 and fix $f$ with $f(k) \in X_k$ for every $k$; putting $a_k := f(k)$ gives a sequence with $a_k \in A$ and $|a_k - x| < 1/(k+1)$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 1.2, L2, L7, choose]

3.1 That sequence converges to $x$: let $\varepsilon > 0$ be rational, fix by [L5] a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$, and put $K := n - 1$, a natural number since $n \ge 1$; for every $k \ge K$ one has $k + 1 \ge n \ge 1$, hence $0 < 1/(k+1) \le 1/n < \varepsilon$ by [L6], and therefore $|a_k - x| < 1/(k+1) < \varepsilon$. [step 2.2, L3, L5, L6, choose]

4.1 Step 2.1 gives the implication from right to left and steps 2.2 and 3.1 give it from left to right, so $x \in \overline{A}$ holds exactly when some sequence with all terms in $A$ converges to $x$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1]

4.2 Sequential closedness: if $A$ is closed and a sequence with all terms in $A$ converges to some $y$, then $y \in \overline{A}$ by step 2.1 and $\overline{A} = A$ by [L1], so $y \in A$; conversely, if every convergent sequence with terms in $A$ has its limit in $A$, then any $y \in \overline{A}$ is the limit of the sequence produced by steps 2.2 and 3.1, hence lies in $A$, so $\overline{A} \subseteq A$, and with $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ this gives $A = \overline{A}$, that is, $A$ is closed. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, L1]

5.1 Both assertions of the statement are proved, namely the sequential description of the closure in step 4.1 and the equivalence of closedness with sequential closedness in step 4.2. [step 4.1, step 4.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the choice is spent, and why it cannot be avoided here.** Step 2.2 is
  the only appeal to [[def-countable-choice]]. A canonical selection would
  require a rule picking a distinguished element of an arbitrary nonempty subset
  of $\mathbb{R}$, and $\mathbb{R}$ carries no well-ordering that this library
  has constructed, so this library has no such rule to offer. Contrast
  [[lem-subset-of-countable]] and [[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]], where
  the selection is from subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ and the least element is
  canonical.

- **The choice is genuinely confined to one direction.** Step 2.1 selects a
  single rational $q$ and a single index $K$ for one $\varepsilon$ at a time, and
  finitely many selections need no choice principle. So "the limit of a
  convergent sequence in a closed set lies in the set" is a theorem of ZF, and
  only the production of a sequence out of a point of the closure is not.

- **The indices start at $0$.** Since $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
  ([[def-sequence]]), the shrinking radii are $1/(k+1)$ and not $1/k$; the
  latter is undefined at $k = 0$. The threshold in step 3.1 is $K = n - 1$ for
  the same reason, and $n \ge 1$ is exactly what makes $K$ a natural number.

## Statement

Every bounded sequence of reals has a convergent subsequence: if $(x_k)$ is a
sequence of reals and there is $M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for every
$k \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-sequence]]), then there is a strictly increasing
$n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ and a real $L$ with $x_{n_j} \to L$.

Equivalently: the subsequential limit set of a bounded sequence is nonempty
([[def-subsequential-limit]]).

The theorem is the exact repair of the false claim that a bounded sequence
converges. A bounded
sequence need not converge, and the alternating sequence is the standing witness;
what boundedness does force is that *some* subsequence converges. The converse of
the theorem is false, and badly so: a sequence with a convergent subsequence need
not be bounded.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals and a real $M$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

[L1] Every sequence of reals has a monotone subsequence ([[lem-peak-monotone-subsequence]]).

[L2] A monotone sequence of reals converges if and only if it is bounded ([[cor-monotone-converges-iff-bounded]]).

[L3] A subsequence $(x_{n_j})$ of $(x_k)$ along a strictly increasing $n$ is again a sequence of reals, and each of its terms is a term of $(x_k)$; a sequence is bounded when some $M$ satisfies $|{\cdot}| \le M$ at every index ([[def-sequence]]).

[L4] Monotone means nondecreasing or nonincreasing ([[def-monotone-sequence]]).

[L5] $L$ is a subsequential limit of $(x_k)$ when some subsequence of $(x_k)$ converges to $L$ ([[def-subsequential-limit]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L1] fix a strictly increasing $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that the subsequence $(x_{n_j})$ is monotone; no hypothesis on $(x_k)$ is needed for this step. [given, L1, L4, choose]

2.1 $(x_{n_j})$ is bounded: each of its terms is a term of $(x_k)$, so $|x_{n_j}| \le M$ for every $j$, with the same $M$. [step 1.1, given, L3]

3.1 Being monotone and bounded, $(x_{n_j})$ converges; write $L$ for its limit. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L2]

4.1 So $(x_k)$ has a convergent subsequence, and $L$ is a subsequential limit of $(x_k)$; in particular the subsequential limit set of a bounded sequence is nonempty. [step 3.1, L5] ∎

## Remarks

- **The proof is two citations, and that is the point of the page order.** All
  the work sits in [[lem-peak-monotone-subsequence]], which needs nothing about
  $\mathbb{R}$ beyond trichotomy, and in [[cor-monotone-converges-iff-bounded]],
  which is where the least-upper-bound property is actually spent. Splitting the
  argument this way isolates the use of completeness in a single place instead of
  burying it in a bisection.

- **Bisection is the other standard proof and is not used here.** Halving the
  interval $[-M, M]$ repeatedly and keeping a half containing infinitely many
  terms produces a nested sequence of intervals whose lengths tend to $0$, and
  [[thm-nested-interval-property]] then yields the limit. That route is
  available in this library, since the nested interval property is proved on this
  page, but it needs an extra argument to choose the terms and to see that the
  chosen indices increase, whereas the monotone-subsequence route needs neither.

- **The limit is not determined by the theorem.** A bounded sequence may have
  many subsequential limits, and the theorem asserts only that there is at least
  one. Which subsequential limits exist, and that there is a largest and a
  smallest, is the subject of the $\limsup$ page.

- **Boundedness is sufficient but not necessary.** The converse fails, by
  [[fs-convergent-subsequence-implies-bounded]] and its witness
  [[cex-unbounded-with-convergent-subsequence]]: a wildly unbounded sequence can
  still have a constant, hence convergent, subsequence.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with closure $\overline{A}$ as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]] and derived set $A'$ as in
[[def-limit-point-r]]. Write

$$E \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing \text{ for every real } \varepsilon > 0 \,\}$$

for the set of adherent points of $A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). Then:

1. $\overline{A} = E$.
2. $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$.
3. $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed superset of $A$: it is closed, it
   contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed $F$ with $A \subseteq F$.
4. $A$ is closed if and only if $A = \overline{A}$, if and only if
   $A' \subseteq A$.

Claim 3 is the content of the definition of $\overline{A}$ and is restated here
so that the four descriptions stand together; claims 1, 2 and 4 are the ones
that carry work.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, and the set $E$ of adherent points of $A$ as displayed in the Statement.

[L1] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; $F$ is closed when $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L2] $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$; $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) = N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$; and if $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ then $\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ and $N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] $\overline{A}$ is the intersection of the nonempty family of closed supersets of $A$; it is closed, it contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed superset of $A$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]).

[L4] $x$ is an adherent point of $A$ when every $N_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $A$, a limit point when every $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $A$, and $A'$ is the set of limit points ([[def-limit-point-r]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $A \subseteq E$: for $x \in A$ and any $\varepsilon > 0$ one has $x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$, so that intersection is nonempty. [L2, L4]

1.2 Let $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus E$; by the definition of $E$ there is a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$. [L4, choose]

1.3 Let $F$ be closed with $A \subseteq F$, and let $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus F$; since $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open there is a real $\eta > 0$ with $N_\eta(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus F$. [L1, choose]

2.1 For every $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ the radius $\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x|$ is positive and $N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, so $N_\delta(y) \cap A = \varnothing$ and $y \notin E$; hence $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$, and since $x$ was an arbitrary point of $\mathbb{R} \setminus E$ that set is open, that is, $E$ is closed. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L4]

2.2 From $N_\eta(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus F \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus A$ we get $N_\eta(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, so $x \notin E$; hence $\mathbb{R} \setminus F \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$, that is, $E \subseteq F$, for every closed $F \supseteq A$. [step 1.3, L4]

3.1 By steps 1.1 and 2.1 the set $E$ is a closed superset of $A$, so $\overline{A} \subseteq E$ by the leastness in [L3]; and $\overline{A}$ is itself a closed superset of $A$ by [L3], so step 2.2 applied to $F = \overline{A}$ gives $E \subseteq \overline{A}$. Hence $\overline{A} = E$, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, L3]

4.1 $E = A \cup A'$: if $x \in E$ and $x \notin A$ then for every $\varepsilon > 0$ some $a \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ exists, and $a \ne x$ because $x \notin A$, so $a \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ and $x \in A'$; conversely $A \subseteq E$ by step 1.1, and $A' \subseteq E$ because $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$. Combining with step 3.1 gives $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$, which is claim 2. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L2, L4]

5.1 Claim 4: if $A$ is closed then $A$ is a closed superset of itself, so $\overline{A} \subseteq A$ by [L3], while $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ by [L3], whence $A = \overline{A}$; conversely if $A = \overline{A}$ then $A$ is closed because $\overline{A}$ is. Finally $A = \overline{A}$ says $A = A \cup A'$ by step 4.1, and $A = A \cup A'$ holds exactly when $A' \subseteq A$. [step 4.1, L3]

6.1 Claim 3 is [L3] restated, and claims 1, 2 and 4 are steps 3.1, 4.1 and 5.1, so all four hold. [step 3.1, step 4.1, step 5.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Which claim does the work in practice.** Claim 1 is the one used almost
  everywhere below: to show a point lies in $\overline{A}$ one exhibits, for each
  $\varepsilon > 0$, a point of $A$ within $\varepsilon$ of it. Claim 2 is what
  separates the two ways a point can be adherent, by membership or by
  accumulation, and it is what makes the notion of an isolated point visible.

- **No special property of $\mathbb{R}$ is used.** The argument uses the
  definitions of open, closed, neighbourhood and closure, and the order enters
  only through the nesting property of neighbourhoods; neither the
  least-upper-bound property nor the Archimedean property appears at any step.
  The results of this page that do use them are flagged in
  [[rem-r-native-topology-scope]].

- **The sequential form is a separate theorem and costs more.** Replacing
  "every neighbourhood meets $A$" by "some sequence in $A$ converges to $x$" is
  [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]], and the passage from the
  first to the second spends the axiom of countable choice, since it selects one
  point of $A$ from each of infinitely many neighbourhoods. The characterisation
  proved above is choice free.

## Statement

Let $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $K$ is compact if and only if $K$ is
sequentially compact ([[def-open-cover-r]]).

Neither implication is formal. Both are routed through the characterisation of
compactness by closed and bounded ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]]), and
the forward implication additionally uses Bolzano-Weierstrass
([[thm-bolzano-weierstrass]]). **The backward implication uses the axiom of
countable choice** ([[def-countable-choice]]): twice, once inside
[[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]] when a point of the closure is
turned into a sequence, and once directly in step 2.3, where an unbounded set
supplies one point beyond each natural bound.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Sequences are indexed by $\mathbb{N}$, which contains $0$ ([[def-sequence]]).

[L1] $K$ is compact when every open cover has a finite subcover, and sequentially compact when every sequence with all terms in $K$ has a subsequence converging to a point of $K$ ([[def-open-cover-r]], [[def-subsequential-limit]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L2] $K$ is compact exactly when $K$ is closed and bounded ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]]).

[L3] Bolzano-Weierstrass: a sequence $(x_k)$ of reals for which some $M$ satisfies $|x_k| \le M$ at every index has a subsequence converging to some real ([[thm-bolzano-weierstrass]]).

[L4] A point lies in $\overline{K}$ exactly when some sequence with all terms in $K$ converges to it, and $K$ is closed exactly when $\overline{K} = K$, exactly when $K$ is sequentially closed ([[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L5] $K$ is bounded exactly when there are $\ell, u$ with $\ell \le y \le u$ for all $y \in K$ ([[def-bounded-set]]).

[L6] Countable choice: for a family $(Y_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of nonempty sets there is $f$ with domain $\mathbb{N}$ and $f(k) \in Y_k$ for every $k$ ([[def-countable-choice]]).

[L7] A convergent sequence of reals is bounded ([[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]]); every subsequence of a convergent sequence converges to the same limit ([[lem-subsequence-inherits-limit]]); a sequence has at most one limit ([[lem-limit-unique]]); a strictly increasing $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ satisfies $n_j \ge j$ ([[lem-index-map-grows]]).

[L8] Archimedean property: for every real $z$ there is a natural $j \ge 1$ with $z < j$; canonical naturals satisfy $k \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} \ge 0$ and are increasing in $k$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L9] Absolute value: $|z| \ge z$, $|z| \ge -z$, $|z| \ge 0$, and $|z| = z$ for $z \ge 0$ while $|z| = -z$ for $z < 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L10] Every nonempty finite set of reals has a maximum, which is one of its members ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For the forward implication assume $K$ is compact; then $K$ is closed and bounded by [L2], so [L5] supplies $\ell, u$ with $\ell \le y \le u$ for every $y \in K$. Let $(x_k)$ be any sequence with $x_k \in K$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$. [assume-hyp, L2, L5]

1.2 For the backward implication assume $K$ is sequentially compact. [assume-hyp, L1]

2.1 The sequence of step 1.1 is bounded: put $M := \max\{|\ell|, |u|\}$ by [L10]; for each $k$, from $\ell \le x_k \le u$ we get $x_k \le u \le |u| \le M$ and $-x_k \le -\ell \le |\ell| \le M$, so $|x_k| \le M$ by [L9]. By [L3] there are a strictly increasing $n$ and a real $L$ with $x_{n_j} \to L$; every term $x_{n_j}$ lies in $K$ and $K$ is closed, so $L \in K$ by [L4]. Hence every sequence in $K$ has a subsequence converging in $K$, that is, $K$ is sequentially compact. [step 1.1, L1, L3, L4, L9, L10]

2.2 A sequentially compact $K$ is closed: let $y \in \overline{K}$; by [L4] there is a sequence $(a_k)$ with $a_k \in K$ for all $k$ and $a_k \to y$; by sequential compactness some subsequence $(a_{n_j})$ converges to a point $z \in K$; but that subsequence also converges to $y$ by [L7], and limits are unique by [L7], so $z = y$ and $y \in K$. Hence $\overline{K} \subseteq K$, so $\overline{K} = K$ and $K$ is closed by [L4]. [step 1.2, L1, L4, L7]

2.3 A sequentially compact $K$ is bounded: suppose it is not. Then for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ the set $Y_k := \{\, y \in K : y > k \text{ or } y < -k \,\}$ is nonempty, since $Y_k = \varnothing$ would mean $-k \le y \le k$ for every $y \in K$ and make $K$ bounded by [L5]. Use [L6] to fix $f$ with $f(k) \in Y_k$ and put $x_k := f(k)$; then $x_k \in K$, and $|x_k| > k$ for every $k$, because $x_k > k \ge 0$ gives $|x_k| = x_k > k$ while $x_k < -k \le 0$ gives $|x_k| = -x_k > k$ by [L9] and [L8]. By sequential compactness some subsequence $(x_{n_j})$ converges, hence is bounded by some real $M$ with $|x_{n_j}| \le M$ for all $j$ by [L7]; by [L8] fix a natural $j \ge 1$ with $M < j$, and then $|x_{n_j}| > n_j \ge j > M$ by [L7] and [L8], which contradicts $|x_{n_j}| \le M$. So $K$ is bounded. [step 1.2, L1, L5, L6, L7, L8, L9]

3.1 A sequentially compact $K$ is therefore closed by step 2.2 and bounded by step 2.3, hence compact by [L2]. [step 2.2, step 2.3, L2]

4.1 Step 2.1 is the forward implication and step 3.1 the backward one, so for subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ compactness and sequential compactness coincide. [step 2.1, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The equivalence is proved, not defined, and it is proved through the order.**
  Both directions pass through [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], whose
  backward half needs the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$, and the forward
  direction adds [[thm-bolzano-weierstrass]], whose proof spends completeness
  again. Nothing here transfers to a setting where those are unavailable; see
  [[rem-r-native-topology-scope]].

- **Where the choices are spent, and whether they can be avoided.** Step 2.3
  selects one point of $K$ outside $[-k,k]$ for each $k$, and
  [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]] selects one point of $K$ in
  each shrinking neighbourhood. Both are countably many independent selections
  from subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, for which this library has no canonical rule, so
  [[def-countable-choice]] is invoked rather than worked around. The forward
  implication, step 2.1, makes no such selection: the subsequence comes from
  [[thm-bolzano-weierstrass]] as a single object.

- **Sequential compactness is the form used in analysis; compactness is the form
  that is stated without sequences.** The extraction of a convergent subsequence
  is what proofs about continuous functions on $[a,b]$ actually use, while the
  covering definition mentions no sequence and no limit. This theorem is what
  lets a reader move between them for subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, and it is proved
  only there.

## Statement

Let $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $E$ is connected ([[def-connected-r]]) if and
only if $E$ is **order-convex** ([[def-interval]]), that is, if and only if

$$x, z \in E \text{ and } x \le w \le z \;\Longrightarrow\; w \in E .$$

**On the word "interval".** Order-convexity is exactly the defining property
that [[def-interval]] proves for each of its nine forms, and in that sense the
theorem says that the connected subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ are the intervals. The
converse classification, that every order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty
or one of the nine forms, is true and is explicitly **not proved anywhere in
this library**; [[def-interval]] records that omission in its own remarks. So
the statement proved below is the equivalence with order-convexity, and the
phrase "is an interval" is to be read as "is order-convex" throughout this page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] Separated sets, disconnection, connectedness; separated sets are disjoint ([[def-connected-r]]).

[L2] $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed superset of $A$, so $A \subseteq B$ gives $\overline{A} \subseteq \overline{B}$ and $\overline{A} \subseteq F$ for every closed $F \supseteq A$; and $\overline{A}$ is exactly the set of points every neighbourhood of which meets $A$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]).

[L3] Order-convexity, and the interval forms: $(-\infty,w]$ and $[w,\infty)$ are closed sets, $(-\infty,w)$ and $(w,\infty)$ are open sets, and the order is total and transitive ([[def-interval]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L4] Least-upper-bound property: a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ bounded above has a unique least upper bound ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-sup-unique]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L5] Epsilon characterisation: for nonempty $S$ bounded above and $c = \sup S$, every $\varepsilon > 0$ admits $s \in S$ with $c - \varepsilon < s$ ([[lem-sup-epsilon]]).

[L6] $N_\varepsilon(x) = \{\, y : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L7] Every nonempty finite set of reals has a minimum, which is one of its members ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L8] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 := 1+1 > 0$ and $2^{-1} > 0$; for $d > 0$ one has $0 < d \cdot 2^{-1} < d$; adding a constant preserves an inequality ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Suppose $E$ is not order-convex: there are $x, z \in E$ and $w \in \mathbb{R}$ with $x \le w \le z$ and $w \notin E$; then $w \ne x$ and $w \ne z$, so $x < w < z$. Put $A := E \cap (-\infty,w)$ and $B := E \cap (w,\infty)$; then $x \in A$ and $z \in B$, so both are nonempty, and $A \cup B = E$ because no element of $E$ equals $w$. [assume-hyp, L3]

1.2 Suppose instead that $E$ is order-convex and that $(A,B)$ is a disconnection of $E$; fix $p \in A$ and $q \in B$. Separated sets are disjoint by [L1], so $p \ne q$, and interchanging the names $A$ and $B$ if necessary, which is legitimate because the hypotheses on the pair are symmetric, we may assume $p < q$. [assume-hyp, L1, choose]

1.3 For a nonempty $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ bounded above, $\sup S \in \overline{S}$: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the fact [L5] supplies $s \in S$ with $\sup S - \varepsilon < s \le \sup S$, so $|s - \sup S| < \varepsilon$ and $s \in N_\varepsilon(\sup S) \cap S$; thus every neighbourhood of $\sup S$ meets $S$, and [L2] gives $\sup S \in \overline{S}$. [L2, L4, L5, L6]

2.1 In the situation of step 1.1 the pair $(A,B)$ is a disconnection: $(-\infty,w]$ is a closed set containing $A$, so $\overline{A} \subseteq (-\infty,w]$ by [L2], whence $\overline{A} \cap B \subseteq (-\infty,w] \cap (w,\infty) = \varnothing$; symmetrically $\overline{B} \subseteq [w,\infty)$ and $A \cap \overline{B} = \varnothing$. So $A$ and $B$ are separated, nonempty, and their union is $E$, and $E$ is disconnected. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L3]

2.2 In the situation of step 1.2 put $S := A \cap [p,q]$; it is nonempty because $p \in A$ and $p \le p \le q$, and it is bounded above by $q$, so $c := \sup S$ exists by [L4], and $p \le c \le q$ since $p \in S$ and $q$ is an upper bound. [step 1.2, L3, L4]

3.1 $c \in A$: from $S \subseteq A$ and [L2] we get $\overline{S} \subseteq \overline{A}$, and $c \in \overline{S}$ by step 1.3, so $c \in \overline{A}$ and hence $c \notin B$ because $\overline{A} \cap B = \varnothing$; on the other hand $p \le c \le q$ with $p, q \in E$ and $E$ order-convex gives $c \in E = A \cup B$, so $c \in A$. [step 1.2, step 1.3, step 2.2, L1, L2]

4.1 $c < q$, since $c \in A$ and $q \in B$ are distinct by [L1] while $c \le q$; and every $v$ with $c < v \le q$ lies in $B$: such a $v$ satisfies $p \le c < v \le q$, so $v \in E$ by order-convexity, and $v \notin A$, for otherwise $v \in A \cap [p,q] = S$ would force $v \le c$. [step 1.2, step 2.2, step 3.1, L1, L3]

5.1 $c \in \overline{B}$, which is impossible: given a real $\varepsilon > 0$, put $t := \min\{\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1},\ (q - c) \cdot 2^{-1}\}$, a positive real by [L7] and [L8] since $q - c > 0$, and $v := c + t$; then $c < v$ and $v \le c + (q-c) \cdot 2^{-1} < q$, so $v \in B$ by step 4.1, while $|v - c| = t \le \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} < \varepsilon$, so $v \in N_\varepsilon(c) \cap B$. Hence every neighbourhood of $c$ meets $B$ and $c \in \overline{B}$ by [L2]; but $c \in A$ by step 3.1 and $A \cap \overline{B} = \varnothing$ by [L1]. So the assumed disconnection cannot exist and an order-convex $E$ is connected. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L1, L2, L6, L7, L8]

6.1 Step 2.1 shows that a set which is not order-convex is disconnected, hence a connected set is order-convex; step 5.1 shows that an order-convex set admits no disconnection, hence is connected. The two together are the asserted equivalence. [step 2.1, step 5.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where completeness is spent.** Only in step 2.2, which produces
  $\sup(A \cap [p,q])$; no other step uses the least-upper-bound property, and
  the rest is the order, ordered-field arithmetic and the definition of
  separation. The obstruction over an incomplete ordered field is traceable to
  the failure of that supremum to exist, and it is visible in
  [[cex-rationals-in-an-interval-are-disconnected]]: the set
  $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,2]$ contains all the rationals between its endpoints and is
  nevertheless disconnected as a subset of $\mathbb{R}$, split at an irrational
  point that $\mathbb{Q}$ does not see.

- **The two directions are of different characters.** "Not order-convex implies
  disconnected" is a construction, step 1.1, and needs nothing beyond the order.
  "Order-convex implies connected" is where the work sits, and the supremum
  $c$ produced in step 2.2 is the point at which the two pieces would have to
  meet; the contradiction is that it is adherent to both.

- **The theorem is about subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ and its statement is written in
  order vocabulary**, so it cannot even be stated where no order is present;
  [[rem-r-native-topology-scope]] collects the results on this page with that
  feature.

## Statement

Let $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $K$ is compact ([[def-open-cover-r]]) if and
only if $K$ is closed ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) and bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]).

This is the Heine-Borel theorem in the form used everywhere below. The forward
implication is [[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]] and spends no
completeness, only the Archimedean property and the existence of maxima of
finite sets; the backward implication rests on
[[thm-heine-borel-r]] and therefore on the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$, and the
remarks below record where it fails without completeness.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] Open cover, finite subfamily and compactness; the empty subfamily covers $\varnothing$ ([[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L2] A compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is closed and bounded ([[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]]).

[L3] Every closed bounded interval $[\ell,u]$ with $\ell \le u$ is compact ([[thm-heine-borel-r]]).

[L4] $K$ is closed exactly when $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L5] $K$ is bounded exactly when there are $\ell, u \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\ell \le y \le u$ for every $y \in K$ ([[def-bounded-set]]).

[L6] $[\ell,u] = \{\, z \in \mathbb{R} : \ell \le z \le u \,\}$ ([[def-interval]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 If $K$ is compact then $K$ is closed and bounded, which is [L2]; this is the forward implication. [L2]

1.2 For the backward implication assume $K$ is closed and bounded. If $K = \varnothing$ then every open cover of $K$ admits the empty subfamily as a finite subcover, so $K$ is compact. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.3 Assume moreover $K \ne \varnothing$; fix $s \in K$ and, by [L5], reals $\ell, u$ with $\ell \le y \le u$ for every $y \in K$. Then $\ell \le s \le u$, so $\ell \le u$, and $K \subseteq [\ell,u]$ by [L6]. [assume-hyp, L5, L6, choose]

2.1 Let $\mathcal{U}$ be an open cover of $K$ and put $\mathcal{W} := \mathcal{U} \cup \{\mathbb{R} \setminus K\}$. Every member of $\mathcal{W}$ is open, since $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$ is open by [L4], and $\mathcal{W}$ covers $[\ell,u]$: a point of $[\ell,u]$ either lies in $K$, hence in some member of $\mathcal{U}$, or lies outside $K$, hence in $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$. [step 1.3, L1, L4]

3.1 By [L3] the interval $[\ell,u]$ is compact, so some finite subfamily $\{W_0, \dots, W_p\}$ of $\mathcal{W}$ covers $[\ell,u]$, where the case of an empty subfamily is possible only when $[\ell,u] = \varnothing$, which is excluded by $\ell \le u$. Put $\mathcal{V} := \{\, W_i : W_i \in \mathcal{U} \,\}$, a finite subfamily of $\mathcal{U}$. Then $K \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{V}$: a point $y \in K \subseteq [\ell,u]$ lies in some $W_i$, and $W_i$ cannot be a member of $\mathcal{W}$ outside $\mathcal{U}$, because the only such member is $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$ and $y \in K$; so $W_i \in \mathcal{U}$ and $W_i \in \mathcal{V}$. [step 2.1, L1, L3, L6]

4.1 Every open cover of a nonempty closed bounded $K$ therefore has a finite subcover, so such a $K$ is compact; together with the empty case of step 1.2 this proves the backward implication, and step 1.1 is the forward one. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 3.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **A closed subset of a compact set is compact.** If $C \subseteq K$ with $K$
  compact and $C$ closed, then $C$ is bounded, being a subset of a bounded set,
  and closed by hypothesis, so it is compact by the theorem. The corresponding
  statement for arbitrary subsets is false: $(0,1) \subseteq [0,1]$ is bounded
  and not compact ([[cex-unbounded-closed-set-not-compact]]).

- **Both hypotheses are needed and neither implies the other.**
  [[cex-unbounded-closed-set-not-compact]] exhibits a closed set that is not
  bounded and a bounded set that is not closed, and neither is compact.

- **What the theorem is not.** It characterises compactness *for subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$*. The two halves are of very different strengths: the forward
  half is elementary and general, while the backward half rests on the
  completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ and fails over $\mathbb{Q}$
  ([[fs-closed-bounded-compact-without-completeness]], witnessed by
  [[cex-closed-bounded-in-q-not-compact]]). Nothing here licenses "closed and
  bounded implies compact" in any other setting.

## Statement

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a \le b$. Then the closed bounded interval
$[a,b]$ ([[def-interval]]) is compact ([[def-open-cover-r]]): every family of
open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ whose union contains $[a,b]$ has a finite subfamily
whose union already contains $[a,b]$.

The proof is by repeated bisection. Supposing some open cover admits no finite
subcover, one halves the interval, keeps a half that still admits none, and
iterates; the halves shrink to a point, which the cover does reach, and a single
member of the cover then swallows a whole late-stage half. **The halving rule is
canonical**, taking the left half whenever the left half works, so the recursion
uses [[thm-recursion]] and no choice principle.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a \le b$ and an open cover $\mathcal{U}$ of $[a,b]$; the set $X := \{\, (u,v) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} : u \le v \,\}$; and the following terminology: a pair $(u,v) \in X$ is **bad** when there are no $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $U_0, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{U}$ with $[u,v] \subseteq U_0 \cup \dots \cup U_n$, that is, when the interval $[u,v]$ admits no finite subcover from $\mathcal{U}$.

[L1] Open cover, subcover, finite subfamily and compactness ([[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L2] Closed bounded intervals: $[u,v] = \{\, z : u \le z \le v \,\}$ is nonempty exactly when $u \le v$; and for $u \le m \le v$ one has $[u,v] = [u,m] \cup [m,v]$, since $z \in [u,v]$ satisfies $z \le m$ or $m < z$ by trichotomy ([[def-interval]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$, and $N_\varepsilon(x) = \{\, y : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L4] Recursion: for a set $Y$, an element $y_0 \in Y$ and a function $G : Y \to Y$ there is $h : \mathbb{N} \to Y$ with $h(0) = y_0$ and $h(k+1) = G(h(k))$ for every $k$ ([[thm-recursion]]).

[L5] Nested interval property: if $[a_k,b_k]$ with $a_k \le b_k$ satisfy $[a_{k+1},b_{k+1}] \subseteq [a_k,b_k]$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, then $\bigcap_{k} [a_k,b_k] \ne \varnothing$ ([[thm-nested-interval-property]]).

[L6] Reciprocal Archimedean property: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]]).

[L7] Canonical naturals: $n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} > 0$ for $n \ge 1$, the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ is strictly increasing, and $(n+1) \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} = n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} + 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]); a positive element has a positive inverse and $0 < c \le d$ gives $0 < 1/d \le 1/c$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

[L8] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, hence $2 := 1 + 1 > 0$ and $2^{-1} > 0$; adding a constant preserves an inequality and multiplying by a positive preserves it ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

[L9] Absolute value: $|y - x| \le v - u$ whenever $x, y \in [u,v]$, because $|y - x|$ equals $y - x$ or $x - y$ and each is at most $v - u$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $[a,b]$ is not compact: some open cover $\mathcal{U}$ of $[a,b]$ has no finite subcover, that is, the pair $(a,b) \in X$ is bad. [assume-contra, L1]

1.2 Bisection rule: for $(u,v) \in X$ put $m := (u+v) \cdot 2^{-1}$, so that $u \le m \le v$ by [L8], and define $G(u,v) := (u,m)$ if $(u,m)$ is bad and $G(u,v) := (m,v)$ otherwise. This is a definition by cases on one condition, so $G : X \to X$ is a function and nothing is selected. [L2, L8, construct]

1.3 If $(u,v)$ is bad then $G(u,v)$ is bad: were both $(u,m)$ and $(m,v)$ not bad, concatenating the two finite lists of members of $\mathcal{U}$ would give a finite subfamily whose union contains $[u,m] \cup [m,v] = [u,v]$ by [L2], so $(u,v)$ would not be bad; hence at least one half is bad, and the rule returns the left half when it is bad and otherwise the right half, which must then be bad. [L1, L2]

2.1 Apply [L4] with $Y = X$, seed $(a,b)$ and map $G$: there is $h : \mathbb{N} \to X$ with $h(0) = (a,b)$ and $h(k+1) = G(h(k))$. Write $h(k) = (a_k,b_k)$, so $a_k \le b_k$ for every $k$, $(a_0,b_0) = (a,b)$, and $(a_{k+1},b_{k+1})$ is one of the two halves of $(a_k,b_k)$. [step 1.2, L2, L4, construct]

3.1 Every $(a_k,b_k)$ is bad, by induction on $k$: the case $k = 0$ is step 1.1, and if $(a_k,b_k)$ is bad then $(a_{k+1},b_{k+1}) = G(a_k,b_k)$ is bad by step 1.3. [step 1.1, step 1.3, step 2.1]

3.2 Writing $\ell_k := b_k - a_k \ge 0$, the intervals are nested and the lengths halve: $[a_{k+1},b_{k+1}]$ is $[a_k,m_k]$ or $[m_k,b_k]$ with $m_k = (a_k+b_k) \cdot 2^{-1}$, and each of these is contained in $[a_k,b_k]$ by [L2], while $m_k - a_k = b_k - m_k = \ell_k \cdot 2^{-1}$, so $\ell_{k+1} = \ell_k \cdot 2^{-1}$. [step 2.1, L2, L8]

4.1 For every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ one has $\ell_k \cdot (k+1) \le \ell_0$, by induction on $k$: at $k = 0$ this reads $\ell_0 \cdot 1 \le \ell_0$; and if it holds at $k$ then $\ell_{k+1} \cdot (k+2) = \ell_k \cdot 2^{-1} \cdot (k+2) \le \ell_k \cdot (k+1) \le \ell_0$, using $\ell_k \ge 0$ and $(k+2) \cdot 2^{-1} \le k+1$, which is $k + 2 \le 2k+2$, that is $0 \le k$. [step 3.2, L7, L8]

4.2 By [L5] the nested family $[a_k,b_k]$ of nonempty closed bounded intervals has a common point $x$; since $x \in [a_0,b_0] = [a,b]$ and $\mathcal{U}$ covers $[a,b]$, fix $U \in \mathcal{U}$ with $x \in U$ and then, $U$ being open, a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$. [step 3.2, L1, L2, L3, L5, choose]

5.1 There is $k \in \mathbb{N}$ with $\ell_k < \varepsilon$: the real $\varepsilon/(\ell_0+1)$ is positive because $\ell_0 + 1 > 0$, so [L6] supplies a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon/(\ell_0+1)$; put $k := n-1$, a natural number, so that $k+1 = n$ and step 4.1 with [L7] gives $\ell_k \le \ell_0 \cdot (1/n) \le \ell_0 \cdot \varepsilon/(\ell_0+1) < \varepsilon$, the last step because $\ell_0 < \ell_0 + 1$ forces $\ell_0/(\ell_0+1) < 1$ and $\varepsilon > 0$. [step 4.1, step 4.2, L6, L7, L8, choose]

6.1 For that $k$ one has $x \in [a_k,b_k]$, and every $y \in [a_k,b_k]$ satisfies $|y - x| \le \ell_k < \varepsilon$ by [L9], so $[a_k,b_k] \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; hence the one-member subfamily $\{U\}$ of $\mathcal{U}$ covers $[a_k,b_k]$ and $(a_k,b_k)$ is not bad, contradicting step 3.1. The assumption of step 1.1 is therefore untenable and $[a,b]$ is compact. [step 3.1, step 4.2, step 5.1, L1, L3, L9, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **What each hypothesis buys.** Closedness enters through [L5]: the nested
  interval property is stated for closed intervals and fails for open ones
  ([[cex-nested-open-intervals-empty]]). Boundedness enters through the same
  fact and through the length computation of step 3.2. Completeness of
  $\mathbb{R}$ enters only inside [[thm-nested-interval-property]] and, through
  [[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], in step 5.1.

- **Why the lengths are handled without powers.** The obvious route is
  $\ell_k = \ell_0 \cdot 2^{-k}$ together with the nullity of a geometric
  sequence, which is available ([[lem-geometric-sequence-null]]). The route
  taken instead, the one-line induction of step 4.1, gives the weaker bound
  $\ell_k \le \ell_0/(k+1)$, which is all step 5.1 needs, and it avoids
  integer powers and the algebra of limits entirely.

- **The recursion is over pairs, not over sets.** The state carried from stage
  to stage is the pair of endpoints, so [L4] applies with $Y = X$ and a total
  map $G$; had the rule been "choose a bad half", the state would have been
  chosen rather than computed and the argument would have needed dependent
  choice, which this library does not have.

- **The converse direction is a separate result.** That a compact subset of
  $\mathbb{R}$ must be closed and bounded is
  [[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]], and the two together give
  [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]].

## Statement

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]) and let $A \subseteq X$,
with closure, derived set and limit points as in
[[def-metric-interior-closure-boundary]]. Then:

1. If $A \ne \emptyset$, then $\overline{A} = \{\, x \in X : d(x,A) = 0 \,\}$,
   where $d(x,A)$ is the distance from a point to a nonempty set
   ([[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]).
2. $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$.
3. $\overline{A}$ is closed, contains $A$, and is contained in every closed
   $F \subseteq X$ with $A \subseteq F$. So $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed
   superset of $A$, and $A$ is closed if and only if $A = \overline{A}$.

Claims 2 and 3 hold for every $A$, the empty set included: $\overline{\emptyset}$
is empty because no ball meets $\emptyset$, and $\emptyset$ is closed because $X$
is open ([[def-metric-topology]]). Claim 1 carries the hypothesis $A \ne \emptyset$
because $d(x,A)$ is defined only for nonempty $A$
([[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A metric space $(X,d)$, a subset $A \subseteq X$, a point $x \in X$, and a closed set $F \subseteq X$ with $A \subseteq F$; when $A \ne \emptyset$, the set $E(x) := \{\, d(x,a) : a \in A \,\}$, whose infimum is $d(x,A)$.

[A1] Closure and derived set: $x \in \overline{A}$ means $B(x,r) \cap A \ne \emptyset$ for every $r > 0$; $x \in A'$ means $B(x,r) \cap (A \setminus \{x\}) \ne \emptyset$ for every $r > 0$ ([[def-metric-interior-closure-boundary]]).

[A2] Open and closed: $U$ is open when every point of $U$ has a ball around it inside $U$; $F$ is closed when $X \setminus F$ is open ([[def-metric-topology]]).

[L1] For nonempty $A$, the set $E(x)$ is nonempty and bounded below by $0$, so $d(x,A) = \inf E(x)$ exists and is a lower bound of $E(x)$ ([[def-metric-bounded-diameter]], [[lem-metric-nonnegativity]], [[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]).

[L2] Epsilon characterisation of the infimum: for a nonempty $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ bounded below and a lower bound $\ell$ of $S$, one has $\ell = \inf S$ if and only if for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $s \in S$ with $s < \ell + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-inf-epsilon]]).

[L3] Balls are open, so a point of a ball has a ball around it inside that ball ([[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]], [[def-metric-ball]]).

[L4] Membership in a ball: $a \in B(x,r)$ means $d(x,a) < r$, and $x \in B(x,r)$ always ([[def-metric-ball]]); trichotomy of the order of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Suppose $A \ne \emptyset$ and $x \in \overline{A}$, and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be arbitrary; then $B(x,\varepsilon) \cap A \ne \emptyset$, so there is $a \in A$ with $d(x,a) < \varepsilon = 0 + \varepsilon$, and $0$ is a lower bound of $E(x)$, so $d(x,A) = 0$ by the epsilon characterisation. [A1, L1, L2, L4]

1.2 Conversely suppose $A \ne \emptyset$ and $d(x,A) = 0$, and let $r > 0$ be arbitrary; the epsilon characterisation supplies $a \in A$ with $d(x,a) < 0 + r = r$, that is $a \in B(x,r) \cap A$, so $x \in \overline{A}$. [A1, L1, L2, L4]

1.3 $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ and $A' \subseteq \overline{A}$: a point $a \in A$ lies in $B(a,r) \cap A$ for every $r$, and a ball meeting $A \setminus \{x\}$ meets $A$. [A1, L4]

1.4 If $x \in \overline{A}$ and $x \notin A$, then for every $r$ the nonempty set $B(x,r) \cap A$ equals $B(x,r) \cap (A \setminus \{x\})$, since $x$ is not a member of $A$; hence $x \in A'$. [A1]

1.5 $\overline{A}$ is closed: let $x \in X \setminus \overline{A}$ and fix $r$ with $B(x,r) \cap A = \emptyset$; for $y \in B(x,r)$ there is $s$ with $B(y,s) \subseteq B(x,r)$, so $B(y,s) \cap A = \emptyset$ and $y \notin \overline{A}$, whence $B(x,r) \subseteq X \setminus \overline{A}$ and $X \setminus \overline{A}$ is open. [A1, A2, L3]

1.6 $\overline{A} \subseteq F$ for every closed $F \supseteq A$: if $x \in \overline{A}$ had $x \notin F$, then $X \setminus F$ open would give $r$ with $B(x,r) \subseteq X \setminus F \subseteq X \setminus A$, so $B(x,r) \cap A = \emptyset$, contradicting $x \in \overline{A}$. [A1, A2, given]

2.1 Claim 1 follows: by step 1.1 every adherent point of a nonempty $A$ satisfies $d(x,A) = 0$, and by step 1.2 every $x$ with $d(x,A) = 0$ is adherent. [step 1.1, step 1.2]

2.2 Claim 2 follows: $A \cup A' \subseteq \overline{A}$ by step 1.3, and $\overline{A} \subseteq A \cup A'$ by step 1.4, since a point of $\overline{A}$ either lies in $A$ or, not lying in $A$, lies in $A'$. [step 1.3, step 1.4]

2.3 Claim 3 follows: $\overline{A}$ is closed by step 1.5, contains $A$ by step 1.3, and sits inside every closed superset of $A$ by step 1.6; in particular if $A$ is closed then $\overline{A} \subseteq A \subseteq \overline{A}$, so $A = \overline{A}$, and conversely if $A = \overline{A}$ then $A$ is closed. [step 1.3, step 1.5, step 1.6]

3.1 Claims 1, 2 and 3 are therefore all established. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Claim 1 is where the infimum does the work.** Reading it right to left,
  $d(x,A) = 0$ says that $A$ has points arbitrarily close to $x$ without saying
  that any of them is $x$; reading it left to right, adherence says the same
  thing in the language of balls. The equivalence is exactly the epsilon
  characterisation of the infimum ([[lem-inf-epsilon]]) with the lower bound $0$.
- **The distance function is $1$-Lipschitz** ([[lem-distance-to-set-is-lipschitz]]),
  so claim 1 exhibits $\overline{A}$ as the zero set of a function that does not
  increase distances. That is not used above and is recorded only as
  orientation.
- **Claim 3 is the form that transfers to general topology**, where no metric is
  available and the closure is defined outright as the intersection of all
  closed supersets. Claim 1 is the specifically metric statement, and claim 2
  sits between them.

## Statement

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]), let $A \subseteq X$, let
$x \in X$ and let $F \subseteq X$. Call $F$ **sequentially closed** when every
sequence in $F$ that converges in $X$ has its limit in $F$. Then:

1. $x \in \overline{A}$ ([[def-metric-interior-closure-boundary]]) if and only if
   there is a sequence $(a_k)$ with $a_k \in A$ for every $k$ and $a_k \to x$ in
   $(X,d)$ ([[def-metric-convergence]]).
2. $F$ is closed ([[def-metric-topology]]) if and only if $F$ is sequentially
   closed.

**The Axiom of Countable Choice is used, once.** The direction of claim 1 that
manufactures a sequence out of adherence makes one choice per natural number, and
that is exactly $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ ([[def-countable-choice]]). The converse
direction, and the direction of claim 2 that goes from closed to sequentially
closed, are choice free. This is flagged at the step that spends it.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A metric space $(X,d)$, a subset $A \subseteq X$, a point $x \in X$, and a subset $F \subseteq X$; for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write $A_n := B\big(x, 1/(n+1)\big) \cap A$.

[A1] Closure: $x \in \overline{A}$ means $B(x,r) \cap A \ne \emptyset$ for every real $r > 0$ ([[def-metric-interior-closure-boundary]], [[def-metric-ball]]).

[A2] Convergence in $(X,d)$: $a_k \to x$ means that for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with $d(a_k,x) < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$, and it is enough to produce such a $K$ for every REAL $\varepsilon > 0$, since below any positive real lies a positive rational ([[def-metric-convergence]], [[def-real-limit]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]], [[lem-metric-nonnegativity]]); and $d(u,v) = d(v,u)$ for all $u, v \in X$, which is the symmetry axiom (M2) ([[def-metric-space]]).

[L1] The balls $B(x,1/n)$, $n \ge 1$, are open, contain $x$, and form a neighbourhood base at $x$: every open $U \ni x$ contains one of them ([[lem-metric-ball-neighbourhood-base]]).

[L2] Balls are open ([[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]]), and $B(x,s) \subseteq B(x,t)$ for $0 < s \le t$ ([[def-metric-ball]]).

[L3] Canonical naturals and reciprocals: for naturals $1 \le m \le p$ one has $0 < m \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} \le p \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ and hence $0 < 1/p \le 1/m$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]); and $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$, so $n + 1 \ge 1$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]).

[L4] Countable choice: for a family $(A_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of nonempty sets there is a function $n \mapsto a_n$ with $a_n \in A_n$ for every $n$ ([[def-countable-choice]]).

[L5] The closure is the smallest closed superset, so $F$ is closed if and only if $F = \overline{F}$ ([[thm-metric-closure-characterisation]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Suppose $(a_k)$ is a sequence with $a_k \in A$ for every $k$ and $a_k \to x$, and let $r > 0$ be an arbitrary real; then there is $K$ with $d(a_k,x) < r$ for all $k \ge K$, so $d(x,a_K) = d(a_K,x) < r$ by the symmetry axiom (M2) of [A2] and hence $a_K \in B(x,r) \cap A$, and since $r$ was arbitrary $x \in \overline{A}$. [A1, A2]

1.2 Suppose $x \in \overline{A}$; then for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the radius $1/(n+1)$ is a positive real and $A_n = B(x,1/(n+1)) \cap A$ is nonempty, so countable choice supplies a sequence $(a_n)$ with $a_n \in A_n \subseteq A$ for every $n$. [A1, L3, L4, choose]

2.1 That sequence converges to $x$: given a real $\varepsilon > 0$, the ball $B(x,\varepsilon)$ is open and contains $x$, so there is a natural $N \ge 1$ with $B(x,1/N) \subseteq B(x,\varepsilon)$; for every $n \ge N$ we have $n + 1 \ge N$, hence $1/(n+1) \le 1/N$ and $a_n \in B(x,1/(n+1)) \subseteq B(x,1/N) \subseteq B(x,\varepsilon)$, that is $d(x,a_n) < \varepsilon$. [step 1.2, A2, L1, L2, L3]

2.2 If $F$ is closed and $(a_k)$ is a sequence in $F$ converging to some $x \in X$, then $x \in \overline{F}$ by step 1.1 applied with $A = F$, and $\overline{F} = F$ because $F$ is closed; so $x \in F$ and $F$ is sequentially closed. [step 1.1, L5]

3.1 Claim 1 holds: step 1.1 gives the implication from a convergent sequence in $A$ to adherence, and steps 1.2 and 2.1 give the converse by producing such a sequence. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.1]

4.1 If $F$ is sequentially closed, let $x \in \overline{F}$; by claim 1 there is a sequence in $F$ converging to $x$, so $x \in F$, whence $\overline{F} \subseteq F$; the reverse inclusion always holds, so $F = \overline{F}$ and $F$ is closed. [step 3.1, L5]

5.1 Claim 2 holds by steps 2.2 and 4.1, and claim 1 by step 3.1. [step 2.2, step 3.1, step 4.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where first countability enters.** Step 2.1 is the only place, and it uses [[lem-metric-ball-neighbourhood-base]] to convert an arbitrary ball around $x$ into one of the countably many balls $B(x,1/N)$. Nothing here should be read as saying that sequences describe the closure in a general topological space; the tool that always works there is the net, and that is a later page.
- **The indexing is from $0$.** The radii used are $1/(n+1)$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, not $1/n$, precisely because $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$ here ([[def-natural-numbers]], [[def-sequence]]) and $1/0$ does not exist. A version of this proof copied from a text that indexes sequences from $1$ has to be reindexed, and this is the reindexing.
- **The use of choice is not concealed.** It enters at exactly one place, namely step 1.2, which makes one selection per natural number, and that is what $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ licenses ([[def-countable-choice]]). Whether some proof in ZF alone reaches the same conclusion for arbitrary metric spaces is a question this library does not settle; what it does is record the assumption at the step that spends it.

## Statement

For each $k \in \mathbb{N}$ let $I_k = [a_k, b_k]$ be a closed bounded interval
with $a_k \le b_k$ ([[def-interval]]), and suppose the family is **nested**:

$$I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k \qquad (k \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Write $\ell_k = b_k - a_k \ge 0$ for the length of $I_k$. Then:

1. $\displaystyle\bigcap_{k \in \mathbb{N}} I_k$ is **nonempty**. More precisely,
   with $a = \sup\{a_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$ and
   $b = \inf\{b_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$, both of which exist, one has $a \le b$
   and $$\bigcap_{k \in \mathbb{N}} I_k = [a, b].$$
2. $\displaystyle\bigcap_{k \in \mathbb{N}} I_k$ is a **single point** if and only
   if $\ell_k \to 0$ ([[def-real-limit]]).

Every hypothesis is load bearing. Dropping closedness makes the intersection
empty; dropping boundedness does the same; and dropping nonemptiness of the
individual intervals is vacuously fatal.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Closed bounded intervals $I_k = [a_k, b_k]$ with $a_k \le b_k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and $I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k$ for every $k$; the sequences $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ of reals ([[def-sequence]]); their ranges $A = \{a_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$ and $B = \{b_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$, both nonempty; and $\ell_k = b_k - a_k$.

[L1] Closed bounded intervals: $[a,b] = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : a \le x \le b\}$; it is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, it is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$, it has two distinct elements $a$ and $b$ when $a < b$, and its length is $b - a$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L2] Least-upper-bound property and uniqueness: a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ bounded above has a unique supremum; the supremum is an upper bound and is $\le$ every upper bound ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L3] Greatest-lower-bound property and uniqueness: a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ bounded below has a unique infimum; the infimum is a lower bound and is $\ge$ every lower bound ([[thm-infimum-property]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L4] Monotone sequences, and the fact that consecutive comparisons suffice: $x_k \le x_{k+1}$ for all $k$ makes $(x_k)$ nondecreasing, and $x_{k+1} \le x_k$ for all $k$ makes it nonincreasing ([[def-monotone-sequence]]).

[L5] Monotone convergence: a nondecreasing sequence whose range is bounded above converges to the supremum of its range, and a nonincreasing sequence whose range is bounded below converges to the infimum ([[thm-monotone-convergence]]).

[L6] Algebra of limits: if $u_k \to u$ and $v_k \to v$ then $u_k - v_k \to u - v$ ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]]).

[L7] A sequence of reals has at most one limit ([[lem-limit-unique]]).

[L8] Bounded above and bounded below, for a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-bounded-set]]).

[L9] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total and transitive, so any two indices $k, l$ admit an index $m$ with $k \le m$ and $l \le m$, namely the larger of the two ([[def-nat-order]], [[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Nestedness read on the endpoints: since $a_{k+1} \le b_{k+1}$, both $a_{k+1}$ and $b_{k+1}$ lie in $I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k$, so $a_k \le a_{k+1}$ and $b_{k+1} \le b_k$ for every $k$. [given, L1]

2.1 Hence $(a_k)$ is nondecreasing and $(b_k)$ is nonincreasing. [step 1.1, L4]

3.1 For all indices $k$ and $l$: choosing $m$ with $k \le m$ and $l \le m$ gives $a_k \le a_m \le b_m \le b_l$, so $a_k \le b_l$. [step 2.1, given, L9]

4.1 Every $b_l$ is therefore an upper bound of $A$ and every $a_k$ a lower bound of $B$; both sets are nonempty, so $a := \sup A$ and $b := \inf B$ exist and are unique. [step 3.1, L2, L3, L8]

5.1 $a \le b$: each $b_l$ is an upper bound of $A$, so $a \le b_l$ for every $l$ by leastness of the supremum; thus $a$ is a lower bound of $B$, and $a \le b$ by greatestness of the infimum. [step 4.1, L2, L3]

5.2 By monotone convergence, $a_k \to a$ and $b_k \to b$. [step 2.1, step 4.1, L5]

5.3 The intersection is exactly $[a,b]$: a real $x$ lies in every $I_k$ exactly when $a_k \le x \le b_k$ for every $k$, that is exactly when $x$ is an upper bound of $A$ and a lower bound of $B$, and by leastness of $a$ and greatestness of $b$ that holds exactly when $a \le x \le b$. [step 4.1, L1, L2, L3]

6.1 $\ell_k = b_k - a_k \to b - a$ by the algebra of limits. [step 5.2, L6]

6.2 Since $a \le b$, the interval $[a,b]$ is nonempty, so the intersection is nonempty; together with step 5.3 this is claim 1. [step 5.1, step 5.3, L1]

7.1 If $\ell_k \to 0$ then $b - a = 0$ by uniqueness of limits, so $a = b$ and the intersection is $[a,a] = \{a\}$, a single point. [step 5.3, step 6.1, L1, L7]

7.2 Conversely, if the intersection is a single point then $a = b$: it equals $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, and $a < b$ would give the two distinct elements $a$ and $b$. Hence $b - a = 0$ and $\ell_k \to 0$ by step 6.1. [step 5.1, step 5.3, step 6.1, L1]

8.1 Claim 1 is step 6.2 and claim 2 is the pair of implications in steps 7.1 and 7.2, so a nested sequence of nonempty closed bounded intervals has nonempty intersection, equal to $[a,b]$, and that intersection is a single point exactly when the lengths tend to $0$. [step 6.2, step 7.1, step 7.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **No Archimedean input is needed.** The lengths are handled entirely by the
  algebra of limits and the uniqueness of limits: $\ell_k$ always converges, to
  $b - a$, and the two directions of claim 2 are then the two directions of
  "$b - a = 0$". A proof that instead argues "if $b - a > 0$ then some $\ell_k$
  is smaller" does need the Archimedean property
  ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]]), and it is avoidable, so it is avoided.

- **Nestedness gives more than it is usually stated to give.** The intersection
  is not merely nonempty; it is the closed interval $[a,b]$, and $a$ and $b$ are
  the limits of the endpoint sequences. The single-point case is exactly the case
  in which those two limits agree, and that is what makes the nested interval
  property usable as a *construction* of a real number, as in
  [[ex-nested-intervals-single-point]].

- **This is one of the standard equivalents of completeness.** Nested intervals
  together with the Archimedean property imply the least-upper-bound property, so
  the implication proved here is not reversible for free: it is half of an
  equivalence whose other half needs the Archimedean hypothesis separately.
  [[rem-completeness-routes]] records where this library stands on those routes.

- **The witnesses for the two deleted hypotheses** are
  [[cex-nested-open-intervals-empty]], which keeps boundedness and drops
  closedness, and [[cex-nested-unbounded-closed-empty]], which keeps closedness
  and drops boundedness. Neither is used above; each shows that the corresponding
  hypothesis cannot be removed.

## Statement

Let open and closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ be as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

1. **Arbitrary unions of open sets are open.** If $\mathcal{U}$ is any family of
   open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, then $\bigcup \mathcal{U}$ is open.
2. **Finite intersections of open sets are open.** If $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
   $U_0, \dots, U_n$ are open, then $U_0 \cap \dots \cap U_n$ is open.
3. **Arbitrary intersections of closed sets are closed.** If $\mathcal{F}$ is a
   nonempty family of closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, then
   $\bigcap \mathcal{F}$ is closed.
4. **Finite unions of closed sets are closed.** If $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
   $F_0, \dots, F_n$ are closed, then $F_0 \cup \dots \cup F_n$ is closed.

The word *finite* in claims 2 and 4 is not decoration: an arbitrary
intersection of open sets need not be open, and dually an arbitrary union
of closed sets need not be closed; the remarks below say where that is settled.
Claim 3 asks $\mathcal{F}$ to be nonempty
only so that $\bigcap \mathcal{F}$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ without appeal to
a convention about the empty intersection.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A family $\mathcal{U}$ of open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, with $\bigcup \mathcal{U} = \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \in U \text{ for some } U \in \mathcal{U} \,\}$; a natural number $n$ and open sets $U_0, \dots, U_n$; a nonempty family $\mathcal{F}$ of closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, with $\bigcap \mathcal{F} = \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \in F \text{ for every } F \in \mathcal{F} \,\}$; and closed sets $F_0, \dots, F_n$.

[A1] De Morgan's laws in the ambient set theory: for a nonempty family $\mathcal{G}$ of subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{R} \setminus \bigcap \mathcal{G} = \bigcup \{\, \mathbb{R} \setminus G : G \in \mathcal{G} \,\}$, and $\mathbb{R} \setminus (G_0 \cup \dots \cup G_n) = (\mathbb{R} \setminus G_0) \cap \dots \cap (\mathbb{R} \setminus G_n)$. Also $\mathbb{R} \setminus (\mathbb{R} \setminus G) = G$.

[L1] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; $F$ is closed when $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L2] $N_\varepsilon(x) = \{\, y : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}$, and $0 < \delta \le \varepsilon$ gives $N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] Every nonempty finite set of reals has a minimum, so $\min\{\varepsilon, \eta\}$ is defined and equals one of the two entries, and is $\le$ both ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $x \in \bigcup \mathcal{U}$. Then $x \in U$ for some $U \in \mathcal{U}$, and $U$ is open, so there is $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{U}$; as $x$ was arbitrary, $\bigcup \mathcal{U}$ is open, which is claim 1. [given, L1, choose]

1.2 Now let $U$ and $V$ be open and let $x \in U \cap V$; fix $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$ and $\eta > 0$ with $N_\eta(x) \subseteq V$. [given, L1, choose]

2.1 Put $\delta := \min\{\varepsilon, \eta\}$, which is one of $\varepsilon, \eta$ and hence $> 0$, and satisfies $\delta \le \varepsilon$ and $\delta \le \eta$; then $N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$ and $N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\eta(x) \subseteq V$, so $N_\delta(x) \subseteq U \cap V$, and as $x$ was arbitrary $U \cap V$ is open. [step 1.2, L2, L3]

2.2 The family $\{\, \mathbb{R} \setminus F : F \in \mathcal{F} \,\}$ consists of open sets by [L1], so its union is open by step 1.1; that union is $\mathbb{R} \setminus \bigcap \mathcal{F}$ by [A1], so $\bigcap \mathcal{F}$ is closed, which is claim 3. [step 1.1, A1, L1]

3.1 Claim 2 now follows by induction on $n$: for $n = 0$ the intersection is $U_0$, which is open by hypothesis; and if $W := U_0 \cap \dots \cap U_n$ is open then $U_0 \cap \dots \cap U_{n+1} = W \cap U_{n+1}$ is an intersection of two open sets, hence open by step 2.1. [step 2.1, given]

4.1 Each $\mathbb{R} \setminus F_i$ is open by [L1], so $(\mathbb{R} \setminus F_0) \cap \dots \cap (\mathbb{R} \setminus F_n)$ is open by step 3.1; that set is $\mathbb{R} \setminus (F_0 \cup \dots \cup F_n)$ by [A1], so $F_0 \cup \dots \cup F_n$ is closed, which is claim 4. [step 3.1, A1, L1]

5.1 Claims 1, 2, 3 and 4 are steps 1.1, 3.1, 2.2 and 4.1 respectively, so arbitrary unions and finite intersections of open sets are open, and arbitrary intersections and finite unions of closed sets are closed. [step 1.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, step 4.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Completeness plays no part.** Nothing above uses the least-upper-bound
  property, or even the Archimedean property: the only facts about $\mathbb{R}$
  the proof touches are the definition of a neighbourhood, its monotonicity in
  the radius, and the comparison of two positive radii. What needs completeness
  is not the algebra of open sets but the theorems about compactness that come
  later.

- **Why finiteness cannot be dropped in claim 2.** The minimum taken in step 2.1
  is a minimum of finitely many positive radii, and it is positive precisely
  because it is one of them ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]). An infinite family of
  positive radii has an infimum that may be $0$, and then no positive $\delta$
  survives. That is exactly what happens for the shrinking intervals of
  [[fs-arbitrary-intersection-of-open-is-open]], whose named witness is
  [[cex-intersection-of-shrinking-intervals-not-open]].

- **The four claims are a rewriting of two.** Claims 3 and 4 are claims 1 and 2
  read through complementation, and closedness is *defined* by complementation
  ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), so no separate argument about closed sets is
  possible or needed.

## Statement

Let $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]). For
$x, y \in \mathbb{R}$ write

$$H(x,y) \;:=\; \{\, z \in \mathbb{R} : x \le z \le y \text{ or } y \le z \le x \,\}$$

for the order-convex hull of the pair, and define a relation on $U$ by

$$x \sim y \quad :\Longleftrightarrow \quad H(x,y) \subseteq U .$$

Then $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $U$. Its equivalence classes, called
the **order components** of $U$, form a family $\mathcal{C}$ with the following
properties:

1. the members of $\mathcal{C}$ are nonempty and pairwise disjoint, and
   $U = \bigcup \mathcal{C}$;
2. every member of $\mathcal{C}$ is an interval of one of the four open forms
   $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$, $(-\infty,\infty)$ of
   [[def-interval]], and is an open set;
3. $\mathcal{C}$ is at most countable ([[def-countable]]).

So every open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is the union of an at most countable family
of pairwise disjoint nonempty open intervals. For $U = \varnothing$ the family
$\mathcal{C}$ is empty and the union of the empty family is $\varnothing$, so the
statement holds in that case too.

**No choice principle is used.** The components are defined by an explicit
equivalence relation, and the enumeration in claim 3 is obtained by sending a
component to the *least* index of a rational lying in it, which is canonical by
[[thm-well-ordering-principle]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An open set $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, the hull $H(x,y)$ and the relation $\sim$ as displayed in the Statement. Write $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the image of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ under the canonical embedding $q \mapsto \hat q$.

[L1] $U$ is open when every $u \in U$ admits a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(u) \subseteq U$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L2] $N_\varepsilon(u) = (u - \varepsilon, u + \varepsilon)$, and $u \in N_\varepsilon(u)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] Order-convexity and the nine interval forms; each of the nine is order-convex, and $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$, $(-\infty,\infty)$ are the open forms; trichotomy and transitivity of the order ([[def-interval]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L4] Least-upper-bound property: a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ bounded above has a least upper bound, unique, and dually a nonempty subset bounded below has a greatest lower bound, unique ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L5] Epsilon characterisations: for nonempty $S$ bounded above and $b = \sup S$, every $\varepsilon > 0$ admits $s \in S$ with $b - \varepsilon < s$; for nonempty $S$ bounded below and $a = \inf S$, every $\varepsilon > 0$ admits $s \in S$ with $s < a + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-sup-epsilon]], [[lem-inf-epsilon]]).

[L6] Bounded above, bounded below, and their negations: $S$ fails to be bounded above exactly when for every $w \in \mathbb{R}$ there is $v \in S$ with $w < v$, and fails to be bounded below exactly when for every $w$ there is $t \in S$ with $t < w$ ([[def-bounded-set]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L7] Strictly between any two reals lies an element of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, and $q \mapsto \hat q$ is injective ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L8] $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-rationals-countable]]); a composition of bijections is a bijection and an injection is a bijection onto its image ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]], [[def-equinumerous]]); every subset of an at most countable set is at most countable ([[lem-subset-of-countable]], [[def-countable]]).

[L9] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 The hull satisfies $x, y \in H(x,y)$, $H(x,y) = H(y,x)$ and $H(x,x) = \{x\}$, and for all $x, y, z$ one has $H(x,z) \subseteq H(x,y) \cup H(y,z)$: given $w \in H(x,z)$, either $x \le w \le z$, in which case $w \le y$ puts $w$ in $H(x,y)$ and $y < w$ puts $w$ in $H(y,z)$, or $z \le w \le x$, in which case $w \le y$ puts $w$ in $H(y,z)$ and $y < w$ puts $w$ in $H(x,y)$. Hence $\sim$ is reflexive on $U$ (as $H(x,x) = \{x\} \subseteq U$), symmetric, and transitive. [given, L3]

1.2 Let $C \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be nonempty, open and order-convex, and let $u \in C$; fix $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(u) \subseteq C$. Then $u - \varepsilon/2$ and $u + \varepsilon/2$ lie in $N_\varepsilon(u) \subseteq C$, so $u$ is neither an upper bound nor a lower bound of $C$. [L1, L2, L3, choose]

1.3 For $x \in U$ put $C_x := \{\, y \in U : H(x,y) \subseteq U \,\}$, the equivalence class of $x$, and let $\mathcal{C} := \{\, C_x : x \in U \,\}$. [construct]

2.1 Each $C_x$ is nonempty because $x \in C_x$; two classes of an equivalence relation are equal or disjoint; and every $x \in U$ lies in $C_x$, so $U = \bigcup \mathcal{C}$. This is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 1.3]

2.2 Each $C_x$ is order-convex: let $u, v \in C_x$ and $u \le w \le v$. From $u \sim x$ and $x \sim v$ we get $u \sim v$, so $H(u,v) \subseteq U$; since $w \in H(u,v)$ we get $w \in U$, and $H(u,w) \subseteq H(u,v) \subseteq U$ because every $t$ with $u \le t \le w$ satisfies $u \le t \le v$, so $u \sim w$ and hence $w \in C_u = C_x$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, L3]

2.3 Each $C_x$ is open: let $u \in C_x \subseteq U$ and fix $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(u) \subseteq U$. For $y \in N_\varepsilon(u)$ the hull $H(u,y)$ is contained in the order-convex set $N_\varepsilon(u)$, hence in $U$, so $u \sim y$ and $y \in C_u = C_x$; therefore $N_\varepsilon(u) \subseteq C_x$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, L1, L2, L3, choose]

2.4 Let $C$ be nonempty, open and order-convex and bounded both above and below; then $a := \inf C$ and $b := \sup C$ exist by [L4]. Every $u \in C$ satisfies $a \le u \le b$, and $u$ is neither an upper nor a lower bound of $C$, so $u \ne a$ and $u \ne b$, giving $a < u < b$; in particular $a < b$ and $C \subseteq (a,b)$. Conversely let $a < w < b$: by [L5] with $\varepsilon = b - w$ there is $v \in C$ with $w < v$, and with $\varepsilon = w - a$ there is $t \in C$ with $t < w$, so $t \le w \le v$ and order-convexity gives $w \in C$. Hence $C = (a,b)$. [step 1.2, L3, L4, L5]

2.5 Let $C$ be nonempty, open and order-convex. If $C$ is bounded below and not above, put $a := \inf C$; as in the bounded case every $u \in C$ satisfies $a < u$, and for $w > a$ the fact [L5] supplies $t \in C$ with $t < w$ while [L6] supplies $v \in C$ with $w < v$, so $w \in C$ by order-convexity; hence $C = (a,\infty)$. Symmetrically, if $C$ is bounded above and not below then $C = (-\infty, b)$ with $b := \sup C$. If $C$ is bounded neither above nor below then for every $w$ the fact [L6] supplies $t, v \in C$ with $t < w < v$, so $w \in C$ and $C = \mathbb{R}$. [step 1.2, L3, L4, L5, L6]

3.1 Every member of $\mathcal{C}$ is nonempty, open and order-convex by steps 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, and it is bounded above or not and bounded below or not, so steps 2.4 and 2.5 exhibit it as an interval of one of the four open forms; this is claim 2. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, step 2.5, L3]

3.2 Every member $C$ of $\mathcal{C}$ contains an element of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$: pick $u \in C$ and, by openness, $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(u) \subseteq C$; since $u - \varepsilon < u + \varepsilon$, the fact [L7] supplies $\hat q$ with $u - \varepsilon < \hat q < u + \varepsilon$, and $N_\varepsilon(u) = (u - \varepsilon, u + \varepsilon)$ by [L2], so $\hat q \in C$. [step 2.1, step 2.3, L2, L7, choose]

4.1 By [L8] fix a bijection $\beta : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$; then $e := \iota \circ \beta$, where $\iota(q) = \hat q$, is a bijection from $\mathbb{N}$ onto $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ by [L7] and [L8]. For $C \in \mathcal{C}$ the set $\{\, n \in \mathbb{N} : e(n) \in C \,\}$ is nonempty by step 3.2, so $\Phi(C) := \min \{\, n \in \mathbb{N} : e(n) \in C \,\}$ is defined by [L9] and no selection is made; and $\Phi$ is injective, since $e(\Phi(C)) \in C$ and distinct members of $\mathcal{C}$ are disjoint by step 2.1. [step 2.1, step 3.2, L7, L8, L9, construct]

5.1 Hence $\mathcal{C}$ is in bijection with $\Phi[\mathcal{C}] \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, and a subset of $\mathbb{N}$ is at most countable, so $\mathcal{C}$ is at most countable; this is claim 3. [step 4.1, L8]

6.1 The family $\mathcal{C}$ constructed in step 1.3 therefore consists of pairwise disjoint nonempty open intervals whose union is $U$, and it is at most countable, which is exactly the assertion. [step 2.1, step 3.1, step 5.1, discharge-construct] ∎

## Remarks

- **The components are forced, not chosen.** A component is an equivalence class
  of an explicitly written relation, so the family $\mathcal{C}$ is determined by
  $U$ alone, with no selection anywhere. One half of the usual uniqueness
  statement is immediate from that: if $U$ is written as a union of nonempty open
  intervals, each of those intervals is order-convex and contained in $U$, so any
  two of its points are equivalent and the whole interval lies inside a single
  component. That the intervals must then *be* the components is the other half,
  and it is neither needed below nor proved here.

- **Where completeness is spent.** Only in steps 2.4 and 2.5, which produce
  $\inf C$ and $\sup C$ from the least-upper-bound property. Everything else
  uses the order alone. The argument therefore does not transpose to an
  arbitrary ordered field, where the two bounds it asks for need not exist; the
  standard obstruction is the set of positive rationals whose square is below
  $2$, which is bounded above in $\mathbb{Q}$ and has no supremum there
  ([[ex-sup-rationals-below-sqrt-two]]).

- **The two sizes in the statement pull in opposite directions.** Each single
  component is an uncountable set, being a nonempty open set
  ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]), while the family of components is at most
  countable. There is no tension: the count in claim 3 is a count of components,
  not of points, and the injection of step 4.1 is into $\mathbb{N}$ through the
  rationals, which are countable and dense at once.

- **This is one of the results whose statement is order vocabulary throughout**,
  and [[rem-r-native-topology-scope]] collects them: interval, disjoint union of
  intervals, and the components themselves are all defined from the order, so
  there is nothing here to restate where no order is present.
