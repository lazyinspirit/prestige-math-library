## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be topological spaces
([[def-topological-space]]). Throughout, $X \times Y$ is the binary product
$\prod_{i<2} X_i$ with $X_0 = X$ and $X_1 = Y$ ([[def-product-topology]]),
carrying the product topology; a point of it is a **function** $z$ on the von
Neumann natural $2 = \{0,1\}$, written $(z_0, z_1)$, and $\pi_0, \pi_1$ are the
two projections.

**The basis used throughout.** For the index set $2$ the product basis and the
box basis coincide, since a box $\prod_{i<2} U_i$ has all but finitely many
factors unrestricted for the trivial reason that it has only two
([[def-product-topology]]). So

$$\{\, U \times V : U \in \mathcal{T},\ V \in \mathcal{T}_Y \,\}$$

is a basis for the product topology on $X \times Y$, and every statement below
that tests a basic open set tests a box of two open sets.

**The diagonal.** The **diagonal** of $X$ is

$$\Delta_X \;:=\; \{\, z \in X \times X : z_0 = z_1 \,\} \;=\; \{\, (x,x) : x \in X \,\} ,$$

the second description being the first read through the definition of a point of
the product as a function on $2$. It is a subset of $X \times X$ and is given the
subspace topology ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]) whenever it is regarded as a
space.

**The diagonal map.** The **diagonal map** of $X$ is

$$\delta_X : X \to X \times X, \qquad \delta_X(x) := (x,x) ,$$

that is, the function sending $x$ to the constant function $2 \to X$ with value
$x$. Its two components are $\pi_0 \circ \delta_X = \mathrm{id}_X$ and
$\pi_1 \circ \delta_X = \mathrm{id}_X$, and by claim 2 of
[[thm-product-universal-property]] it is the *unique* function $X \to X \times X$
with those two components. The same claim makes it **continuous**
([[def-continuous-map-top]]), the identity being continuous. Its image is
$\Delta_X$, and it is injective, since $\delta_X(x) = \delta_X(x')$ forces
$x = x'$ by reading the coordinate at $0$. Whether $\delta_X$ is an **embedding**
onto $\Delta_X$ ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]) is not asserted here; it is
the content of the next item.

**The pairing of two maps.** For functions $f : Z \to X$ and $g : Z \to Y$ on a
common domain, the **pairing** is

$$\langle f, g \rangle : Z \to X \times Y, \qquad \langle f, g \rangle(z) := (f(z), g(z)) .$$

By claim 2 of [[thm-product-universal-property]] it is the unique function
$Z \to X \times Y$ with $\pi_0 \circ \langle f, g \rangle = f$ and
$\pi_1 \circ \langle f, g \rangle = g$; no hypothesis on $f$ and $g$ is needed
for the pairing to be defined, and continuity of the pairing is exactly
continuity of both components, which is again that claim. In this notation

$$\delta_X = \langle \mathrm{id}_X, \mathrm{id}_X \rangle ,$$

so the diagonal map is a special case of the pairing and needs no separate
treatment.

**The preimage identity that every later proof uses.** For $f, g : Z \to Y$,

$$\langle f, g \rangle^{-1}[\Delta_Y] \;=\; \{\, z \in Z : f(z) = g(z) \,\} ,$$

directly from the definitions above: $\langle f, g \rangle(z) \in \Delta_Y$ says
that the function $(f(z), g(z))$ on $2$ takes the same value at $0$ and at $1$.

## Remarks

- **The diagonal is a subset of a product, and the diagonal map is a function
  into it; they are different objects with the same name.** The set $\Delta_X$
  records which pairs are repetitions, and the map $\delta_X$ produces the
  repetitions. Both are needed: the closedness criterion of this page is about the
  set, and the transport of properties from $X$ to its copy inside the square is
  about the map.

- **Nothing here depends on a choice principle.** The product $X \times X$ is a
  binary product, and a point of it is exhibited by naming its two coordinates;
  the nonemptiness of an arbitrary product, which is where choice enters
  ([[thm-product-universal-property]], claim 4), is never invoked for a binary
  product with a named point.

- **Why the box description is recorded at the top.** The criterion proved on
  this page tests basic open sets of $X \times X$, and for the binary product
  there is no gap between the box topology and the product topology to worry
  about ([[def-product-topology]]). No infinite product is formed anywhere on
  this page, so the distinction never becomes live here.

## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be topological spaces
([[def-topological-space]]), let $f : X \to Y$ be a function and let $x \in X$.
Neighbourhoods are as in [[def-neighbourhood-top]].

$f$ is **continuous at $x$** if for every neighbourhood $V$ of $f(x)$ in $Y$ the
preimage $f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ in $X$.

$f$ is **continuous** if it is continuous at every point of $X$.

**The same condition with open sets only.** $f$ is continuous at $x$ if and only
if for every open $V \subseteq Y$ with $f(x) \in V$ there is an open
$U \subseteq X$ with $x \in U$ and $f[U] \subseteq V$. Indeed, if $f$ is
continuous at $x$ and $V$ is such an open set, then $V$ is a neighbourhood of
$f(x)$, so $f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ and contains an open $U \ni x$,
which satisfies $f[U] \subseteq V$. Conversely, given the displayed condition and
a neighbourhood $V$ of $f(x)$, fix open $V_0$ with $f(x) \in V_0 \subseteq V$ and
then open $U \ni x$ with $f[U] \subseteq V_0$; then $x \in U \subseteq f^{-1}[V_0] \subseteq f^{-1}[V]$,
so $f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$. Both forms are used below and are the
same statement written twice.

**Preimage, not image.** $f^{-1}[V] = \{\, x \in X : f(x) \in V \,\}$
is the preimage in the sense of [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]] and is
defined for every function, invertible or not; no inverse function is being
asserted to exist. Continuity is a condition on preimages throughout, and the
corresponding conditions on images define the *open* and *closed* maps of a later
item, which are different notions.

## Remarks

- **This is the metric definition when both topologies are metric topologies.**
  For metric spaces, $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ continuity at $a$
  ([[def-metric-continuity]]) says that every ball around $f(a)$ has a ball
  around $a$ mapped into it, and the balls around a point are a neighbourhood
  base there; the identification is carried out where metrizable spaces are
  defined later on this page. Nothing about a metric survives in the definition
  above: continuity is a relation between two topologies and a function, and it
  is meaningless to ask whether a function between bare sets is continuous.

- **Continuity depends on both topologies, and coarsening the target or refining
  the source only helps.** If $f$ is continuous and $\mathcal{T}_X$ is replaced
  by a finer topology, or $\mathcal{T}_Y$ by a coarser one, $f$ remains
  continuous, since each condition to be verified is weakened and each
  neighbourhood available in the source is still available. In particular every
  map out of a discrete space and every map into an indiscrete space is
  continuous ([[def-standard-topologies]]).

- **Continuity at a point is strictly weaker than continuity.** A function may be
  continuous at exactly one point, and the definition above is deliberately local
  so that the sequential criteria proved later can be stated pointwise.

## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be topological spaces and let
$f : X \to Y$ be a function. Continuity is as in [[def-continuous-map-top]],
injections, surjections and bijections as in
[[def-injection-surjection-bijection]].

- $f$ is an **open map** if $f[U]$ is open in $Y$ for every open $U \subseteq X$.
- $f$ is a **closed map** if $f[F]$ is closed in $Y$ for every closed
  $F \subseteq X$.
- $f$ is a **homeomorphism** if $f$ is a continuous bijection whose inverse
  $f^{-1} : Y \to X$ is also continuous. The spaces are **homeomorphic**, written
  $X \cong Y$, when a homeomorphism $X \to Y$ exists.
- $f$ is an **embedding** if $f$ is injective and the corestriction
  $f_0 : X \to f[X]$, $f_0(x) = f(x)$, is a homeomorphism onto $f[X]$ carrying
  the subspace topology inherited from $Y$ ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]).

**The inverse in the third clause exists because $f$ is a bijection**, and it is
the unique two-sided inverse ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]); no choice
principle is involved. Continuity of $f^{-1}$ is a genuine additional demand: a
continuous bijection need not be a homeomorphism, and this page records that
failure as a false statement with a two-point witness.

**Open, closed and homeomorphism are three different conditions.** A
homeomorphism is continuous by definition, but an open map need not be continuous
and a closed map need not be continuous; and continuity implies neither openness
nor closedness. An open map need
not be closed and a closed map need not be open, and Sierpinski space
$S = \{a,b\}$ with open point $b$ ([[def-standard-topologies]]) witnesses both
failures at once: the constant map $S \to S$ with value $b$ is open, since the
image of every nonempty set is the open set $\{b\}$, and is not closed, since the
image of the closed set $\{a\}$ is $\{b\}$, whose complement $\{a\}$ is not open;
the constant map with value $a$ is closed and not open by the same computation
read the other way. What is true
is that for a **continuous bijection** the three notions collapse: it is a
homeomorphism exactly when it is open, exactly when it is closed. That is proved
in the next item and is not assumed here.

**Topological properties.** A **property of topological spaces** is a condition
$P$ that is either true or false of each space. $P$ is a **topological property**
(one is also said to be *preserved by homeomorphism*, or *invariant*) when
$X \cong Y$ implies that $P(X)$ and $P(Y)$ have the same truth value. Since
$\cong$ is an equivalence relation on spaces — the identity is a homeomorphism,
inverses and composites of homeomorphisms are homeomorphisms, all three verified
in the next item — a topological property is exactly one that is constant on each
$\cong$-class.

**What a homeomorphism transports.** If $h : X \to Y$ is a homeomorphism then
$U \mapsto h[U]$ is a bijection from $\mathcal{T}_X$ onto $\mathcal{T}_Y$, with
inverse $V \mapsto h^{-1}[V]$: both maps are well defined because $h$ and
$h^{-1}$ are continuous, and they are mutually inverse because $h$ is a
bijection. So a homeomorphism is an isomorphism of the structure "a set together
with a distinguished family of subsets", and every notion defined from the open
sets alone — closed, closure, interior, boundary, dense, convergence of
sequences, continuity of maps into and out of the space — is carried across by
it. Anything defined from extra data, such as a metric or an order, is not, and
that distinction is exactly what the phrase *topological property* is for.

## Remarks

- **Being an embedding is not the same as being injective and continuous.** The
  identity from a set with the discrete topology to the same set with a coarser
  topology is injective and continuous, its image is the whole space, and it is
  an embedding only if the two topologies agree. The extra content of "embedding"
  is that the source topology is recovered as the trace of the target one, which
  is precisely the characteristic property of the subspace topology.

- **The inclusion of a subspace is the model embedding.** For $S \subseteq X$
  with the subspace topology, $\iota : S \to X$ is injective and its
  corestriction to $\iota[S] = S$ is the identity of $(S, \mathcal{T}_S)$, hence
  a homeomorphism; so $\iota$ is an embedding
  ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]). Conversely an embedding
  $f : X \to Y$ identifies $X$ with the subspace $f[X]$ of $Y$, which is the
  sense in which "$X$ sits inside $Y$" is ever asserted in this library.

- **The notation $X \cong Y$ hides the map, and sometimes that matters.** Two
  spaces may be homeomorphic by many different homeomorphisms, and no canonical
  one is claimed by the notation. Where a specific map is used it is named.

## Definition

**The product set.** Let $I$ be a set and let $X_i$ be a set for each $i \in I$.
The **product** is

$$\prod_{i \in I} X_i \;:=\; \Big\{\, x : x \text{ is a function with domain } I \text{ and } x(i) \in X_i \text{ for every } i \in I \,\Big\},$$

and we write $x_i := x(i)$, the $i$-th **coordinate** of $x$. Two elements of the
product are equal exactly when they agree at every index, functions being equal
when they have the same domain and the same values. For $j \in I$ the $j$-th
**projection** is

$$\pi_j : \prod_{i \in I} X_i \to X_j, \qquad \pi_j(x) := x_j .$$

**Notation for a finite product.** For $I = n$ a natural number, which is the set
$\{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ of its predecessors, an element of $\prod_{k<n} X_k$ is a
function on $n$ and we write it $(x_0, \dots, x_{n-1})$. In particular $I = 2$
gives the **binary product**, written $X \times Y$ for $\prod_{i<2} X_i$ with
$X_0 = X$ and $X_1 = Y$, whose elements are written $(u,v)$ for the function
$0 \mapsto u$, $1 \mapsto v$. This is the only meaning the symbol $X \times Y$
carries on this page.

**Two facts about when the product is nonempty, stated because they are used and
because they cost something.** If some $X_{i_0}$ is empty then the product is
empty, since no function can take a value in $X_{i_0}$. Conversely, suppose every
$X_i$ is nonempty.

- For $I = n$ a natural number, the product is nonempty, and this is a theorem of
  ZF: [[lem-finite-choice]] applied to the function $i \mapsto X_i$ on $n$
  supplies a choice function $g$ for the family of values, and
  $x(i) := g(X_i)$ defines a member of $\prod_{k<n} X_k$.
- For an arbitrary $I$ the assertion "$\prod_{i \in I} X_i \ne \varnothing$
  whenever every $X_i$ is nonempty" **is** the Axiom of Choice: it is the
  formulation recorded in [[def-axiom-of-choice]], and the choice function of
  [[def-choice-function]] is exactly a point of the product of a family by
  itself. Every use of it below is flagged at the step that spends it.

**The box topology.** Now let each $X_i$ carry a topology $\mathcal{T}_i$
([[def-topological-space]]). Put

$$\mathcal{R} \;:=\; \Big\{\, \prod_{i \in I} U_i \;:\; U_i \in \mathcal{T}_i \text{ for every } i \in I \,\Big\},$$

the family of **boxes**. $\mathcal{R}$ is a basis for a topology
([[thm-basis-criterion]]): it contains $\prod_i X_i$, so it covers the product,
and it is closed under binary intersections, since

$$\Big(\prod_i U_i\Big) \cap \Big(\prod_i V_i\Big) = \prod_i (U_i \cap V_i)$$

and each $U_i \cap V_i$ is open by (T3). The topology it generates is the **box
topology** $\mathcal{T}^{\square}$, and $\mathcal{R}$ is a basis for it
([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]).

**The product topology.** The **product topology** $\mathcal{T}^{\Pi}$ on
$\prod_i X_i$ is the initial topology of the family of projections
$(\pi_i)_{i \in I}$ ([[def-initial-and-final-topology]]): the topology generated
by the subbasis

$$\mathcal{G} \;:=\; \{\, \pi_i^{-1}[U] : i \in I,\ U \in \mathcal{T}_i \,\}, \qquad \pi_i^{-1}[U] = \prod_{j \in I} W_j \ \text{ with } W_i = U \text{ and } W_j = X_j \text{ for } j \ne i .$$

By [[thm-basis-criterion]] the finite intersections of members of $\mathcal{G}$
form a basis for $\mathcal{T}^{\Pi}$, and those finite intersections are exactly
the boxes with all but finitely many factors unrestricted:

$$\mathcal{R}^{\Pi} \;=\; \Big\{\, \prod_{i \in I} U_i \;:\; U_i \in \mathcal{T}_i \text{ for every } i, \text{ and } U_i = X_i \text{ for all but finitely many } i \,\Big\}.$$

Indeed the intersection of $\pi_{i_1}^{-1}[U_1], \dots, \pi_{i_n}^{-1}[U_n]$ is
the box whose factor at $i$ is the intersection of those $U_m$ with $i_m = i$ and
is $X_i$ when no $i_m$ equals $i$; and the intersection of no members is the
whole product, the box with every factor $X_i$. Conversely a box with
$U_i = X_i$ off a finite set is such an intersection. Members of
$\mathcal{R}^{\Pi}$ are called **basic product-open** sets, and members of
$\mathcal{R}$ **boxes**. So $\mathcal{R}^{\Pi} \subseteq \mathcal{R}$, with
equality when $I$ is a natural number.

**The empty product.** For $I = \varnothing$ there is exactly one function with
domain $\varnothing$, the empty function, so $\prod_{i \in \varnothing} X_i$ is a
one-point set. A one-point set carries exactly one topology, namely
$\{\varnothing, \{\varnothing\}\}$, since a topology must contain the empty set
and the whole set and there is nothing else to contain
([[def-topological-space]]); so the box topology and the product topology agree
there, and both equal the discrete topology and the indiscrete topology
([[def-standard-topologies]]), which coincide on a one-point set. There are no
projections to speak of, and the initial topology of the empty family is indeed
the indiscrete one ([[def-initial-and-final-topology]]).

**Convention.** Unless the box topology is named explicitly, $\prod_i X_i$ always
carries the product topology in this library. That is not a matter of taste: the
product topology is the one with the characteristic property of the next item,
and the box topology has no such property.

## Remarks

- **Where the two topologies actually differ.** The box topology is finer than
  the product topology by construction, since $\mathcal{R}^{\Pi} \subseteq
  \mathcal{R}$. They agree whenever $I$ is finite; and, assuming the Axiom of Choice, for a
  family of **nonempty** spaces they differ for infinite $I$ as soon as infinitely
  many factors have a nonempty proper open subset. Nonemptiness is not decoration: if one factor is
  empty then the product is empty and carries exactly one topology, so the two
  agree however the other factors are chosen. Both statements are proved two items
  below, with that hypothesis, and the failure is recorded on this page as a false
  statement.

- **The product set is a set of functions, and that is not a technicality.** The
  factors are indexed by an arbitrary set, so there is no "list" to write down;
  writing $x = (x_i)_{i \in I}$ is notation for the function $x$. The finite case
  recovers the familiar tuple, and the identification of $\prod_{k<n}\mathbb{R}$
  with the $\mathbb{R}^n$ of [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] is literal, that item defining
  $\mathbb{R}^n$ as the set of functions $n \to \mathbb{R}$.

- **The projections carry no hypothesis.** They are defined for every product,
  including the empty one and products with an empty factor; what does need a
  hypothesis is their *surjectivity*, which is the point at which choice enters
  and which is stated separately in the next item.

## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]) and let
$S \subseteq X$. The **subspace topology** (also *relative topology*) on $S$ is

$$\mathcal{T}_S := \{\, U \cap S : U \in \mathcal{T} \,\},$$

the family of **traces** on $S$ of the open sets of $X$. The pair
$(S, \mathcal{T}_S)$ is a **subspace** of $X$. A subset of $S$ that lies in
$\mathcal{T}_S$ is said to be **open in $S$**, and *relatively open* where the
ambient space needs emphasis.

**$\mathcal{T}_S$ is a topology, and this is discharged here.** (T1):
$\varnothing = \varnothing \cap S$ and $S = X \cap S$ are traces. (T2): if
$\mathcal{S}' \subseteq \mathcal{T}_S$, choose for each member a set of
$\mathcal{T}$ tracing to it — no choice principle is needed, since
$U' := \bigcup \{\, U \in \mathcal{T} : U \cap S \subseteq W \,\}$ is a canonical
such set for $W \in \mathcal{T}_S$, being open by (T2) in $X$ and satisfying
$U' \cap S = W$ — and then
$\bigcup_i (U_i \cap S) = (\bigcup_i U_i) \cap S \in \mathcal{T}_S$ by (T2) in
$X$. (T3): $(U \cap S) \cap (V \cap S) = (U \cap V) \cap S \in \mathcal{T}_S$ by
(T3) in $X$.

**Closed sets of a subspace are the traces of the closed sets.** A set
$C \subseteq S$ is closed in $S$ if and only if $C = F \cap S$ for some closed
$F \subseteq X$. Indeed $S \setminus (U \cap S) = (X \setminus U) \cap S$ and
$S \setminus (F \cap S) = (X \setminus F) \cap S$, so complementation inside $S$
matches complementation inside $X$ under tracing.

**Bases and subbases trace as well.** If $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for
$\mathcal{T}$ ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]) then
$\mathcal{B}_S := \{\, B \cap S : B \in \mathcal{B} \,\}$ is a basis for
$\mathcal{T}_S$: its members are open in $S$, and for $W = U \cap S$ open in $S$
and $x \in W$ there is $B \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B \subseteq U$, whence
$x \in B \cap S \subseteq W$. The same computation with a subbasis $\mathcal{S}$
shows that $\{\, S_0 \cap S : S_0 \in \mathcal{S} \,\}$ is a subbasis for
$\mathcal{T}_S$, since tracing commutes with finite intersections and with
unions.

**The inclusion is continuous.** The inclusion map $\iota : S \to X$,
$\iota(s) = s$, satisfies $\iota^{-1}[U] = U \cap S$ for every $U \subseteq X$,
so preimages of open sets are open and $\iota$ is continuous
([[thm-continuity-characterisations-top]], clause (b)). Moreover
$\mathcal{T}_S$ is the **coarsest** topology on $S$ making $\iota$ continuous: any
topology on $S$ for which $\iota$ is continuous must contain every
$\iota^{-1}[U] = U \cap S$, hence contain $\mathcal{T}_S$.

**Characteristic property of a map into a subspace.** Let $(Z, \mathcal{T}_Z)$ be
a topological space and let $g : Z \to S$ be a function. Then

$$g \text{ is continuous as a map } Z \to (S,\mathcal{T}_S) \iff \iota \circ g \text{ is continuous as a map } Z \to (X,\mathcal{T}) .$$

*Proof.* For $U \in \mathcal{T}$ one has
$(\iota \circ g)^{-1}[U] = g^{-1}[\iota^{-1}[U]] = g^{-1}[U \cap S]$. If $g$ is
continuous then each $g^{-1}[U \cap S]$ is open, so $\iota \circ g$ is continuous;
conversely if $\iota \circ g$ is continuous then for any $W = U \cap S$ open in
$S$ the set $g^{-1}[W] = (\iota \circ g)^{-1}[U]$ is open, so $g$ is continuous.
Both directions use only clause (b) of [[thm-continuity-characterisations-top]].

**Restriction of a continuous map.** If $f : X \to Y$ is continuous and
$S \subseteq X$, then $f|_S : S \to Y$ is continuous, since
$(f|_S)^{-1}[V] = f^{-1}[V] \cap S$ is open in $S$ for every open $V \subseteq Y$
([[def-continuous-map-top]], [[thm-continuity-characterisations-top]]).

**When relative and ambient agree.** If $S$ is open in $X$ then a subset of $S$
is open in $S$ if and only if it is open in $X$: a trace $U \cap S$ is then an
intersection of two open sets of $X$, and conversely an open subset of $X$
contained in $S$ is its own trace. The same statement with "closed" throughout
holds when $S$ is closed in $X$. Both are used in the pasting lemma of the next
item, and both fail without the hypothesis: $S$ itself is always open and closed
in $S$, and need be neither in $X$.

## Remarks

- **The subspace topology is what makes a subset a space.** Before it, a statement
  such as "the restriction of $f$ to $C$ is continuous" has no meaning, because
  $C$ carries no topology. Every restriction below is taken with respect to the
  subspace topology and with no other convention available.

- **Openness and closedness are not absolute.** $[0,1)$ is open in $[0,2)$ and is
  neither open nor closed in $\mathbb{R}$; the interval $(0,1)$ is closed in
  itself. A sentence of the form "$A$ is open" is incomplete unless the space is
  named, and this library names it whenever more than one is in play.

- **Transitivity.** If $S \subseteq T \subseteq X$ then the subspace topology $S$
  inherits from $(T, \mathcal{T}_T)$ is the subspace topology it inherits from
  $X$, since $(U \cap T) \cap S = U \cap S$ for $U \in \mathcal{T}$. So no
  ambiguity arises from the route by which a subset is reached.

## Definition

Let $X$ be a set and write $\mathcal{P}(X)$ for its power set. A **topology** on
$X$ is a family $\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ such that

- **(T1)** $\varnothing \in \mathcal{T}$ and $X \in \mathcal{T}$;
- **(T2)** $\bigcup \mathcal{S} \in \mathcal{T}$ for every $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$;
- **(T3)** $U \cap V \in \mathcal{T}$ for all $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$.

A **topological space** is a pair $(X, \mathcal{T})$ consisting of a set $X$ and
a topology $\mathcal{T}$ on it; the elements of $X$ are its **points**. When only
one topology is in play we write $X$ for the pair; when several are, the topology
is always named.

The members of $\mathcal{T}$ are the **open** sets of $(X,\mathcal{T})$. A subset
$F \subseteq X$ is **closed** when its complement $X \setminus F$ is open, and
**clopen** when it is both open and closed. By (T1) both $\varnothing$ and $X$
are clopen. *Open and closed are not opposites*: a set may be neither, and it may
be both, so "not open" is never a synonym for "closed".

**Finite intersections, and the empty one.** Axiom (T3) is stated for two sets
because that is all that is ever needed: if $n \ge 1$ and
$U_1, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{T}$, then $U_1 \cap \dots \cap U_n \in \mathcal{T}$
follows by iterating (T3) $n-1$ times. The intersection of the **empty** family
of subsets of $X$ is $X$, since the condition "lies in every member of the empty
family" is vacuous; that case is covered by (T1) rather than by (T3), which is
one of the two reasons $X \in \mathcal{T}$ is demanded outright. The other is
that (T2) alone gives only $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$.

**The closed sets, and the dual axiomatisation.** Put
$\mathcal{C} := \{\, X \setminus U : U \in \mathcal{T} \,\}$, the family of closed
sets. Then

- **(C1)** $\varnothing \in \mathcal{C}$ and $X \in \mathcal{C}$;
- **(C2)** $\bigcap \mathcal{D} \in \mathcal{C}$ for every **nonempty**
  $\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$;
- **(C3)** $C \cup D \in \mathcal{C}$ for all $C, D \in \mathcal{C}$.

Conversely, if a family $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ satisfies (C1),
(C2) and (C3), then $\mathcal{T} := \{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{C} \,\}$
is a topology on $X$ whose closed sets are exactly the members of $\mathcal{C}$.
So a topology may be presented equally well by its open sets or by its closed
sets, and this library uses whichever is shorter.

*Both directions are one computation, and it is carried out here rather than
assumed.* The map $U \mapsto X \setminus U$ is an involution of
$\mathcal{P}(X)$, hence a bijection, and it carries the two De Morgan identities

$$X \setminus \bigcup_{i \in I} A_i = \bigcap_{i \in I} (X \setminus A_i) \quad (I \ne \varnothing), \qquad X \setminus \bigcap_{i \in I} A_i = \bigcup_{i \in I} (X \setminus A_i) \quad (I \ne \varnothing)$$

term by term into each other. Given (T1)–(T3): $\varnothing = X \setminus X$ and
$X = X \setminus \varnothing$ lie in $\mathcal{C}$, which is (C1); for nonempty
$\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$ the family
$\mathcal{S} = \{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{D} \,\}$ lies in $\mathcal{T}$
and $\bigcap \mathcal{D} = X \setminus \bigcup \mathcal{S}$ is closed by (T2),
which is (C2); and $C \cup D = X \setminus ((X \setminus C) \cap (X \setminus D))$
is closed by (T3), which is (C3). Given (C1)–(C3) the same three lines run
backwards, the empty-union case $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$ being supplied
by (C1) rather than by (C2); and $\{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{C} \,\}$ has
$\mathcal{C}$ as its family of complements because complementation is an
involution.

**Comparison of topologies.** If $\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ are
topologies on the same set $X$ and $\mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2$, then
$\mathcal{T}_1$ is **coarser** than $\mathcal{T}_2$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ is
**finer** than $\mathcal{T}_1$; the comparison is **strict** when the inclusion
is. Inclusion is a partial order on the set of topologies on $X$
([[def-partial-order]]), and it is not a total one: two topologies on the same
set may be incomparable.

## Remarks

- **The topology is part of the data.** Two different topologies on one set are
  two different topological spaces, exactly as two different metrics on one set
  are two different metric spaces. Every statement below that says "the space
  $X$" has a topology fixed in advance.

- **Nothing is assumed beyond (T1)–(T3).** In particular no separation property
  is built into the word *space* here: distinct points need not lie in disjoint
  open sets, singletons need not be closed, and both failures occur in the
  standard topologies defined on the next item. Where a separation property is
  used it is stated as a hypothesis.

- **This library always writes *coarser* and *finer*.** The synonyms
  *smaller/larger* are unambiguous, but *weaker/stronger* is used in both
  directions in the literature and is avoided here entirely.

- **Why "arbitrary unions, finite intersections" and not the reverse.** The
  asymmetry is not a convention: it is what makes the metric notion of open set
  ([[def-metric-topology]]) an instance, and an arbitrary intersection of open
  sets genuinely need not be open. The failure is recorded on this page as a
  false statement, with witnesses in two different spaces.

## Statement

Let $(X_i, \mathcal{T}_i)_{i \in I}$ be topological spaces and let
$P := \prod_{i \in I} X_i$ carry the product topology, with projections $\pi_j$
([[def-product-topology]]). Then:

1. **The projections are continuous**, and the product topology is the coarsest
   topology on $P$ making all of them continuous.
2. **Characteristic property.** For every space $Z$ and every function
   $h : Z \to P$,
   $$h \text{ is continuous } \iff \pi_i \circ h \text{ is continuous for every } i \in I .$$
   The functions $\pi_i \circ h$ are the **components** of $h$, and every family
   of functions $h_i : Z \to X_i$ arises from exactly one $h$, namely
   $h(z)(i) := h_i(z)$.
3. **The projections are open maps** ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]), for
   the product topology and for the box topology alike. They need not be closed;
   that failure is recorded on this page as a false statement.
4. **Surjectivity.** If every $X_i$ is nonempty then every $\pi_j$ is surjective.
   For $I$ a natural number this is a theorem of ZF ([[lem-finite-choice]]); for
   an arbitrary $I$ it is the Axiom of Choice ([[def-axiom-of-choice]]), and this
   is the only place in the item where a choice principle is used.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Topological spaces $(X_i,\mathcal{T}_i)_{i \in I}$, the product $P = \prod_{i \in I} X_i$ with the product topology and the projections $\pi_j(x) = x_j$, a space $Z$ and a function $h : Z \to P$, and an index $j \in I$.

[A1] The product topology on $P$ is the initial topology of $(\pi_i)_{i \in I}$, and a basis for it is the family of boxes $\prod_i U_i$ with every $U_i$ open and $U_i = X_i$ for all but finitely many $i$; a basis for the box topology is the family of all boxes $\prod_i U_i$ with every $U_i$ open ([[def-product-topology]], [[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]).

[A2] $f$ is an open map when $f[U]$ is open in the target for every open $U$ in the source ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]).

[L1] For a topology given as an initial topology of a family $(f_i)$: each $f_i$ is continuous, the topology is the coarsest with that property, and a map $h$ into it is continuous exactly when every $f_i \circ h$ is ([[thm-initial-and-final-characteristic-properties]], claims 1 and 2; [[def-initial-and-final-topology]], [[def-continuous-map-top]]).

[L2] If $F$ is a function with domain a natural number $n$ whose values are nonempty sets, then the family of its values has a choice function ([[lem-finite-choice]], [[def-choice-function]]).

[L3] If every member of a family of sets is nonempty then the product of the family is nonempty; this is the Axiom of Choice ([[def-axiom-of-choice]], [[def-choice-function]]).

[L4] The image of a union is the union of the images, and an arbitrary union of open sets is open ([[def-topological-space]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [A1] the product topology is an initial topology, so [L1] gives claim 1 and claim 2 at once, the defining family being $(\pi_i)_{i \in I}$. [A1, L1]

1.2 For a family of functions $h_i : Z \to X_i$ the assignment $h(z)(i) := h_i(z)$ defines a function $Z \to P$, since $h(z)$ has domain $I$ and $h(z)(i) = h_i(z) \in X_i$; it satisfies $\pi_i \circ h = h_i$, and any $h'$ with $\pi_i \circ h' = h_i$ for every $i$ satisfies $h'(z)(i) = h_i(z) = h(z)(i)$ for all $z$ and $i$, hence $h' = h$. [given]

1.3 Let $B = \prod_i U_i$ be a box with every $U_i$ open. If $B = \varnothing$ then $\pi_j[B] = \varnothing$. If $B \ne \varnothing$, fix $b \in B$; then $\pi_j[B] = U_j$, since $\pi_j[B] \subseteq U_j$ by definition, and for $u \in U_j$ the function $y$ with $y_j := u$ and $y_i := b_i$ for $i \ne j$ lies in $B$ and has $\pi_j(y) = u$. [A1, choose]

1.4 Assume every $X_i$ is nonempty and $I$ is a natural number $n$. By [L2] applied to $i \mapsto X_i$ there is a choice function $g$ for the family of values, and $x(i) := g(X_i)$ defines a point of $P$; so $P \ne \varnothing$. [L2]

1.5 Assume every $X_i$ is nonempty and $I$ is arbitrary. By [L3] the product $P$ is nonempty. [L3]

2.1 Both the box topology and the product topology have a basis consisting of boxes, by [A1], and the image of a union of basic sets is the union of their images; so by step 1.3 the image under $\pi_j$ of any open set of either topology is a union of sets each of which is $\varnothing$ or an open $U_j \subseteq X_j$, hence open. This is claim 3. [step 1.3, A1, A2, L4]

2.2 Assume every $X_i$ is nonempty and let $t \in X_j$. By step 1.4 when $I$ is a natural number, and by step 1.5 in general, there is a point $p \in P$; the function $y$ with $y_j := t$ and $y_i := p_i$ for $i \ne j$ then lies in $P$ and satisfies $\pi_j(y) = t$. So $\pi_j$ is surjective, which is claim 4. [step 1.4, step 1.5]

3.1 Step 1.1 gives claims 1 and 2, step 1.2 gives the bijection between maps into $P$ and families of component maps, step 2.1 gives claim 3 and step 2.2 gives claim 4. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.1, step 2.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Exactly where choice is spent, and where it is not.** Openness of the
  projections (claim 3) is choice free: step 1.3 uses a *single* point of the box
  in question, which is given by the assumption that the box is nonempty, and
  builds the required preimage from it by changing one coordinate. Surjectivity
  (claim 4) is different, because there the point has to be produced from nothing
  but nonemptiness of the factors, and for an infinite index set that is the
  Axiom of Choice itself.

- **The characteristic property is what makes the product topology the right
  one.** The box topology has no analogue of claim 2: a map into a box-topologised
  product may have all components continuous and fail to be continuous, and the
  companion page exhibits the diagonal of $\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}$ doing exactly
  that.

- **Openness does not survive to closedness.** A projection is always open and is
  in general not closed, and the standard witness, the hyperbola in
  $\mathbb{R}^2$, is worked in the false statement on this page. There is no
  asymmetry of taste here: images of open boxes are computed coordinatewise,
  while a closed set of the product need not be a union of closed boxes at all.
