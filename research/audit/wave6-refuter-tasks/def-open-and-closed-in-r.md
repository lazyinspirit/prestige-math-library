## Definition

Let $U, F \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]].

- $U$ is **open** when for every $x \in U$ there is a real $\varepsilon > 0$
  with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$.
- $F$ is **closed** when its complement $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open.
- A set is **clopen** when it is both open and closed.

The whole of the topology of $\mathbb{R}$ developed on this page rests on this
one definition: closedness is *defined* as openness of the complement, and every
other description of a closed set on this page is a theorem
([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]]).

**$\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen.** The condition defining openness
quantifies over the elements of the set, so it holds vacuously for
$\varnothing$; and for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ one has $N_1(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$,
so $\mathbb{R}$ is open. Since each of the two is the complement of the other,
each is also closed.

**Every neighbourhood is open.** Let $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and put
$\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x|$, which is $> 0$ because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$. The nesting property of [[def-neighbourhood-r]] gives
$N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$. So every point of $N_\varepsilon(x)$
has a neighbourhood inside it.

**The four open forms of [[def-interval]] are open sets.** Let $a, b \in
\mathbb{R}$.

- $(a,b)$: for $x$ with $a < x < b$, both $x - a > 0$ and $b - x > 0$, so
  $\delta := \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ is a positive real (the minimum of a
  two-element set of reals exists, [[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).
  If $|y - x| < \delta$ then $y > x - \delta \ge x - (x - a) = a$ and
  $y < x + \delta \le x + (b - x) = b$, so $y \in (a,b)$; hence
  $N_\delta(x) \subseteq (a,b)$.
- $(a,\infty)$: for $x > a$ take $\delta := x - a > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y > x - \delta = a$.
- $(-\infty,b)$: for $x < b$ take $\delta := b - x > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y < x + \delta = b$.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: already treated above.

**The four closed forms of [[def-interval]] are closed sets.** In each case the
complement is shown open directly.

- $[a,b]$: if $x \notin [a,b]$ then $x < a$ or $x > b$ by trichotomy
  ([[def-ordered-field]]). If $x < a$, take $\delta := a - x > 0$; every
  $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has $y < x + \delta = a$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. If
  $x > b$, take $\delta := x - b > 0$; every $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has
  $y > x - \delta = b$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. So
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus [a,b]$ is open.
- $[a,\infty)$: its complement is $(-\infty,a)$, which is open by the previous
  paragraph.
- $(-\infty,b]$: its complement is $(b,\infty)$, which is open.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: its complement is $\varnothing$, which is
  open.

## Remarks

- **Open and closed are not opposites, and not exhaustive.** A set may be
  neither: the half-open interval $[0,1)$ is neither open nor closed
  ([[fs-every-set-is-open-or-closed]]). A set may be both: $\varnothing$ and
  $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen. The words are inherited from the interval terminology
  of [[def-interval]], and the agreement between the two usages is exactly the
  two lists verified above: an interval called open there is an open set here,
  and an interval called closed there is a closed set here.

- **A clopen set is a disconnection waiting to happen.** If $A$ is clopen and
  both $A$ and $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ are nonempty, then each of the two is
  its own closure, so the two are separated in the sense of
  [[def-connected-r]] and $\mathbb{R} = A \cup (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)$ is a
  disconnection. Since $\mathbb{R}$ is order-convex it is connected
  ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]]), so no such $A$ exists:
  $\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are the only clopen subsets of $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The half-open forms are the ones the two lists omit**, and deliberately so:
  $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ with $a < b$ are neither open nor closed as subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The radius depends on the point.** Openness asks for *some* $\varepsilon$
  at each point, and that $\varepsilon$ may shrink to nothing as the point
  approaches the edge of the set, as the computation for $(a,b)$ shows: there
  $\delta = \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ tends to $0$ as $x$ tends to either endpoint.
  Asking instead for a single $\varepsilon$ that works simultaneously at every
  point of the set is a strictly stronger condition, and it is not what is
  defined here; nothing on this page uses it.

## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq F$.

- $u \in F$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$; $S$ is
  **bounded above** if it has an upper bound.
- $u \in F$ is a **least upper bound** (or **supremum**, $\sup S$) of $S$ if $u$
  is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le u'$ for every upper bound $u'$ of $S$.

$F$ is a **complete ordered field** (equivalently, $F$ has the
**least-upper-bound property**, or is **Dedekind complete**) if every nonempty
$S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$.

## Remarks

- A least upper bound, if it exists, is unique (two least upper bounds are each
  $\le$ the other, so equal by antisymmetry of the order).
- Applying the property to $\{-s : s \in S\}$ yields the dual **greatest lower
  bound** (infimum) property, so the two are equivalent.
- The Dedekind-cut reals have this property by construction
  ([[thm-dedekind-complete]]); the Cauchy-sequence reals acquire it via
  [[cor-cauchy-reals-lub-complete]]. This definition is the target for the
  uniqueness theorem [[thm-uniqueness-complete-ordered-field]].

## Definition

Let $A, B, E \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with closure as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]].

- $A$ and $B$ are **separated** when
  $$\overline{A} \cap B = \varnothing \quad \text{and} \quad A \cap \overline{B} = \varnothing .$$
- A **disconnection** of $E$ is a pair $(A,B)$ of nonempty separated sets with
  $E = A \cup B$.
- $E$ is **disconnected** when it admits a disconnection, and **connected** when
  it does not.

**Separated is strictly stronger than disjoint.** Since $A \subseteq
\overline{A}$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]), the first displayed
condition already gives $A \cap B \subseteq \overline{A} \cap B = \varnothing$,
so separated sets are disjoint. The converse fails: $(0,1)$ and $[1,2)$ are
disjoint, yet every neighbourhood of $1$ meets $(0,1)$, so $1$ is an adherent
point of $(0,1)$ and lies in $\overline{(0,1)}$
([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]]), while $1 \in [1,2)$; hence
$\overline{(0,1)} \cap [1,2) \ne \varnothing$ and the pair is not separated.
What separation adds to disjointness is exactly this: **neither set of a
separated pair may contain a point adherent to the other**, which is what makes
a disconnection a genuine splitting rather than a bookkeeping partition.

**Separation does not ask the two closures to be disjoint.** Each condition
tests one closure against the *other set*, never closure against closure. The
pair $(0,1)$, $(1,2)$ illustrates the difference and is separated: $[0,1]$ is a
closed set containing $(0,1)$, so $\overline{(0,1)} \subseteq [0,1]$
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]) and
$\overline{(0,1)} \cap (1,2) = \varnothing$; symmetrically
$\overline{(1,2)} \subseteq [1,2]$ and $(0,1) \cap \overline{(1,2)} =
\varnothing$. The two closures nevertheless share the point $1$, so a definition
demanding $\overline{A} \cap \overline{B} = \varnothing$ would be a different and
strictly stronger condition, and it is not the one used here.

## Remarks

- **Why separation and not "both pieces open".** For a subset $E$ of
  $\mathbb{R}$ the pieces of a splitting are rarely open as subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$: in the disconnection of $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,2]$ used by
  [[cex-rationals-in-an-interval-are-disconnected]] neither piece is open in
  $\mathbb{R}$. Rudin's separated-sets formulation avoids introducing a second
  topology relative to $E$, and it is the only formulation this page uses.
  Nothing below refers to sets open "in $E$".

- **Every one-point set and the empty set are connected.** A disconnection
  requires two nonempty pieces with union $E$, and if $E$ has at most one point
  no two nonempty disjoint sets have union $E$.

- **Connectedness of a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ turns out to be an order
  property**: $E$ is connected exactly when it is order-convex
  ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]]). That is a theorem about
  $\mathbb{R}$ and uses its completeness; the definition above mentions no order
  at all.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $m \in \mathbb{R}$.

- $m$ is a **maximum** (or *greatest element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $s \le m$
  for every $s \in S$.
- $m$ is a **minimum** (or *least element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $m \le s$
  for every $s \in S$.

A set has at most one maximum: if $m_1$ and $m_2$ are both maxima then
$m_1 \in S$ gives $m_1 \le m_2$ and $m_2 \in S$ gives $m_2 \le m_1$, so
$m_1 = m_2$ by antisymmetry of the order, which is immediate from the trichotomy
axiom of an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).
The same argument applies to minima, so we may write $\max S$ and $\min S$.

## Remarks

- A maximum is precisely an upper bound of $S$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]])
  that happens to lie in $S$; a minimum is a lower bound of $S$
  ([[def-bounded-set]]) that lies in $S$. In particular a set with a maximum is
  bounded above and a set with a minimum is bounded below.
- The empty set has neither a maximum nor a minimum, because the requirement
  $m \in S$ cannot be met.
- The membership requirement $m \in S$ is exactly what separates a maximum from a
  supremum, and it is the theme of this page. A supremum is a bound on the set
  and is not asked to belong to it; a maximum is an element of the set. The two
  agree exactly when the supremum happens to be attained ([[lem-max-is-sup]]),
  and they genuinely differ in general ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has both a maximum and a minimum
  ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]), which is what licenses the notation
  $\max\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$. Infinite sets need not: the failure of attainment is
  an infinitary phenomenon.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]) and its absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]).

Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ with
$\varepsilon > 0$. The **$\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\},$$

and the **punctured $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \;=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}.$$

The two descriptions of $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ agree because $|y - x| = 0$ holds
exactly when $y = x$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**A neighbourhood is an open interval.** For every $x$ and every
$\varepsilon > 0$,

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;=\; (x - \varepsilon,\ x + \varepsilon),$$

the interval of [[def-interval]]. Indeed [[lem-of-abs-value]] gives, for
$\varepsilon > 0$, the equivalence $|y - x| < \varepsilon \iff -\varepsilon <
y - x < \varepsilon$, and adding $x$ throughout turns the right-hand side into
$x - \varepsilon < y < x + \varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**The centre lies in its own neighbourhoods.** $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, since
$|x - x| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**Punctured neighbourhoods are never empty.** The element
$y := x + \varepsilon/2$ satisfies $|y - x| = \varepsilon/2$, which is
$> 0$ and $< \varepsilon$, so $y \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$
([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

**Monotonicity in the radius.** If $0 < \delta \le \varepsilon$ then
$N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, because $|y - x| < \delta \le
\varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**Nesting at an interior point.** If $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and
$0 < \delta \le \varepsilon - |y - x|$, then

$$N_\delta(y) \;\subseteq\; N_\varepsilon(x).$$

Indeed for $z \in N_\delta(y)$ the triangle inequality
([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]) gives
$|z - x| = |(z - y) + (y - x)| \le |z - y| + |y - x| < \delta + |y - x| \le
\varepsilon$. Note that $\varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ precisely because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, so such a $\delta$ always exists.

## Remarks

- **The radius is a real number, not a rational.** Nothing on this page tests a
  condition against rational radii only. That convention belongs to
  [[def-real-limit]], where the quantifier is over rational $\varepsilon$ and
  the passage between the rational and the real form is the sanctioned remark of
  [[def-sequence]]. Here $\varepsilon$ ranges over the positive reals
  throughout, and every statement above is proved for an arbitrary positive
  real.

- **Why the punctured version is separated out.** A limit point of a set is a
  point every punctured neighbourhood of which meets the set
  ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and deleting the centre is exactly what stops a point
  of the set from qualifying automatically. The unpunctured condition defines
  the weaker notion of an adherent point, and the difference between the two is
  precisely an isolated point.

- **Nesting is the workhorse.** Almost every openness verification on this page
  has the shape "given $y$ in the set, shrink the radius by the distance
  already travelled", which is the nesting property above. It is recorded here
  once so that no later proof has to redo the triangle inequality in passing.

## Definition

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ ([[def-field]]) together with a subset
$P \subseteq F$, the set of **positive** elements (the *positive cone*),
satisfying:

- **(O1) Trichotomy.** For each $x \in F$, exactly one of the following holds:
  $x \in P$, or $x = 0$, or $-x \in P$.
- **(O2) Closure.** If $x, y \in P$ then $x + y \in P$ and $x \cdot y \in P$.

We write $x > 0$ for $x \in P$ (read "$x$ is positive"), and define the order by

$$a < b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; b - a \in P, \qquad a \le b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; a < b \text{ or } a = b.$$

Thus $a > b$ means $b < a$, and $a \ge b$ means $b \le a$. An element $x$ with
$-x \in P$ (equivalently $x < 0$) is called **negative**.

## Remarks

- By trichotomy applied to $b - a$, for any $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$,
  $a = b$, $a > b$ holds; this makes $\le$ a total order.
- (O2) says the positives are closed under addition and multiplication: sums and
  products of positives are positive.
- The rationals ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and both constructions of the reals
  ([[thm-reals-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-dedekind-ordered-field]]) are ordered
  fields, so every fact proved here from (O1)-(O2) holds in each of them.

## Definition

A real $x$ is **positive** when it has a representative $(a_n)$ together
with a rational $\delta > 0$ and an index $N$ such that $a_n > \delta$
for all $n \ge N$. Define

$$x \le y \iff x = y \;\text{ or }\; y - x \text{ is positive},$$

and $|x| = x$ if $x \ge 0$, $|x| = -x$ otherwise.

## Remarks

- Independence of the representative, trichotomy, and compatibility with the
  field operations: [[thm-reals-ordered-field]].
- The triangle inequality for this $|\cdot|$ holds because the proof of
  [[lem-rat-triangle]] uses only the axioms of a totally ordered field.

## Statement

**False claim:** every subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is open or closed
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

The claim treats "closed" as the negation of "open". It is not: closedness of a
set is openness of its *complement*, and both conditions can fail at once. The
half-open interval $[0,1)$ ([[def-interval]]) is the standard witness, and it
fails each condition at a different point, at $0$ for openness and at $1$ for
closedness.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The half-open interval $E := [0,1) = \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : 0 \le x < 1 \,\}$ ([[def-interval]]).

[A1] The false claim: every subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is open or closed.

[L1] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; $F$ is closed when $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L2] $N_\varepsilon(x) = \{\, y : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] Every nonempty finite set of reals has a minimum, which is one of its members and is $\le$ both entries of a two-element set ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L4] Absolute value: $|z| = z$ for $z \ge 0$ and $|z| = -z$ for $z < 0$; $|z| \ge 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L5] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 := 1+1 > 0$ and $0 < d \cdot 2^{-1} < d$ for every $d > 0$; adding a constant preserves an inequality; the order is total and transitive ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $0 \in E$ and $1 \notin E$, since $0 \le 0 < 1$ while $1 < 1$ fails; so $1 \in \mathbb{R} \setminus E$. [given, L5]

1.2 $E$ is not open: let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real and put $y := -(\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1})$. Then $|y - 0| = \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} < \varepsilon$ by [L4] and [L5], so $y \in N_\varepsilon(0)$; but $y < 0$, so $y \notin E$. Hence no neighbourhood of the point $0$ of $E$ is contained in $E$. [L1, L2, L4, L5]

1.3 $\mathbb{R} \setminus E$ is not open: let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real, put $t := \min\{\varepsilon, 1\} \cdot 2^{-1}$, which is positive and satisfies $t \le \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} < \varepsilon$ and $t \le 1 \cdot 2^{-1}$ by [L3] and [L5], and put $y := 1 - t$. Then $y \ge 1 - 1 \cdot 2^{-1} > 0$ and $y < 1$, so $y \in E$; and $|y - 1| = t < \varepsilon$ by [L4], so $y \in N_\varepsilon(1)$. Hence no neighbourhood of the point $1$ of $\mathbb{R} \setminus E$ is contained in $\mathbb{R} \setminus E$. [L1, L2, L3, L4, L5]

2.1 By step 1.2 the set $E$ is not open, and by steps 1.1 and 1.3 its complement is not open, so $E$ is not closed either. The subset $E$ of $\mathbb{R}$ is therefore neither open nor closed, and the claim [A1] is false. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, A1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The two failures are independent and happen at different points.** Openness
  fails only at $0$: every $x$ with $0 < x < 1$ does have a neighbourhood inside
  $E$. Closedness fails only at $1$: every $x$ outside $E$ other than $1$ does
  have a neighbourhood outside $E$. So the set is one point short of open and one
  point short of closed, and the two repairs move the endpoint in opposite
  directions, as the next remark records.

- **The four possibilities all occur.** $\mathbb{R}$ and $\varnothing$ are both
  open and closed, $(0,1)$ is open and not closed, $[0,1]$ is closed and not
  open, and $[0,1)$ is neither ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]). "Open" and
  "closed" are two independent properties, not two values of one property.

- **The named witness** is
  [[cex-half-open-interval-neither-open-nor-closed]]; the refutation itself is
  carried out here.

## Statement

For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and all $a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n \in \mathbb{R}$, the
set $\{a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ has a maximum and a minimum ([[def-max-min]]).

What is proved below is exactly the displayed statement, by induction on $n$.

The usual reading, that *every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has a
maximum and a minimum*, follows once one identifies the nonempty finite subsets
of $\mathbb{R}$ with the sets listable as $\{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$. That
identification is recorded as a stipulation in the Given below, because this page
has no definition of finiteness to prove it against. **It is discharged, not
merely assumed**: [[lem-finite-subsets-listable]] proves that the two
descriptions of a nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ agree. That lemma is
recorded in `justified_by` rather than in `deps`, since it is about the sets this
lemma quantifies over and therefore depends on this one. This is what licenses
the notation
$\max\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ and $\min\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ for finite sets of
**real** numbers from this page onwards.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Real numbers $a_0, a_1, a_2, \dots$; for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write $F_n := \{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$, so that $F_{n+1} = F_n \cup \{a_{n+1}\}$. A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and finite exactly when it equals $F_n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and some choice of $a_0, \dots, a_n$.

[A1] $P(n)$ denotes the statement: for all $a_0, \dots, a_n \in \mathbb{R}$, the set $F_n$ has a maximum and a minimum.

[L1] Maximum and minimum: $m = \max X$ means $m \in X$ and $x \le m$ for all $x \in X$; $m = \min X$ means $m \in X$ and $m \le x$ for all $x \in X$; each is unique when it exists ([[def-max-min]]).

[L2] Induction principle: if $P(0)$ holds and $P(n)$ implies $P(n+1)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $P(n)$ holds for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, where $n + 1$ denotes the successor $\sigma(n)$ ([[thm-induction-principle]], [[def-nat-addition]]).

[L3] The order on $\mathbb{R}$ is reflexive, total and transitive: $a \le a$; for all $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds, so at least one of $a \le b$ and $b \le a$ holds; and $a \le b$ with $b \le c$ gives $a \le c$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case: $F_0 = \{a_0\}$, and $a_0 \in F_0$ with $a_0 \le a_0$ by reflexivity, so $a_0$ is both a maximum and a minimum of $F_0$; hence $P(0)$ holds. [base, A1, L1, L3]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume $P(n)$, that is, for all reals $a_0, \dots, a_n$ the set $F_n$ has a maximum and a minimum. [ih, A1]

2.1 Let $a_0, \dots, a_{n+1} \in \mathbb{R}$ be arbitrary; by the inductive hypothesis the set $F_n$ has a maximum $M$ and a minimum $m$, and $F_{n+1} = F_n \cup \{a_{n+1}\}$. [step 1.2, L1]

3.1 By totality at least one of $a_{n+1} \le M$ and $M \le a_{n+1}$ holds. If $a_{n+1} \le M$, then $M \in F_n \subseteq F_{n+1}$, every element of $F_n$ is $\le M$ because $M = \max F_n$, and $a_{n+1} \le M$ as well, so $M$ is a maximum of $F_{n+1}$. If $M \le a_{n+1}$, then $a_{n+1} \in F_{n+1}$, every $x \in F_n$ satisfies $x \le M \le a_{n+1}$ hence $x \le a_{n+1}$ by transitivity, and $a_{n+1} \le a_{n+1}$, so $a_{n+1}$ is a maximum of $F_{n+1}$. Either way $F_{n+1}$ has a maximum. [step 2.1, L1, L3]

3.2 Dually, at least one of $m \le a_{n+1}$ and $a_{n+1} \le m$ holds. If $m \le a_{n+1}$, then $m \in F_{n+1}$ and every element of $F_{n+1}$ is $\ge m$, so $m$ is a minimum of $F_{n+1}$. If $a_{n+1} \le m$, then $a_{n+1} \in F_{n+1}$ and every $x \in F_n$ satisfies $a_{n+1} \le m \le x$ hence $a_{n+1} \le x$ by transitivity, so $a_{n+1}$ is a minimum of $F_{n+1}$. Either way $F_{n+1}$ has a minimum. [step 2.1, L1, L3]

4.1 Since $a_0, \dots, a_{n+1}$ were arbitrary, $F_{n+1}$ has a maximum and a minimum for every such list, that is, $P(n)$ implies $P(n+1)$. [step 3.1, step 3.2, A1]

5.1 The base case and the inductive step give $P(n)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ by the induction principle; since a nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is exactly a set of the form $F_n$, every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has both a maximum and a minimum. [step 1.1, step 4.1, given, L2, discharge-induction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the stipulation is discharged.** Finiteness itself is defined later, in [[def-countable]], as equinumerosity with a von Neumann natural; with that definition in hand [[lem-finite-subsets-listable]] proves that a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and finite exactly when it is listable as $\{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$, which is the Given below. So nothing on this page rests on an assumption that is never paid for; it is paid for later, and the payment is recorded in `justified_by`.
- **Only the total order is used, never completeness.** The base case needs reflexivity, the inductive step needs totality and transitivity, and the induction itself runs over $\mathbb{N}$. The same induction works in any totally ordered field; what is recorded here is its specialisation to $\mathbb{R}$.
- Nonemptiness is essential: $\emptyset$ is finite and has no maximum ([[def-max-min]]). Finiteness is essential too: $\{x \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < x < 1\}$ is bounded and has no maximum ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Combined with claim 1 of [[lem-max-is-sup]], this says every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has a supremum, and that the supremum is attained, because it equals the maximum. The infimum half is *not* part of [[lem-max-is-sup]], which speaks only of maxima and suprema; it follows from the minimum proved here together with the reflection identity $\inf X = -\sup(-X)$ ([[lem-reflection]], [[thm-infimum-property]]).

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}$, with closure as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]] and sequences and convergence as in
[[def-sequence]] and [[def-real-limit]]. Then

$$x \in \overline{A} \iff \text{there is a sequence } (a_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \text{ with } a_k \in A \text{ for every } k \text{ and } a_k \to x .$$

Consequently $A$ is closed if and only if it is **sequentially closed**: whenever
a sequence with all its terms in $A$ converges, its limit lies in $A$.

**The right-to-left direction is choice free; the left-to-right direction spends
$\mathrm{AC}_\omega$** ([[def-countable-choice]]). Producing a sequence from a
point of the closure requires selecting one point of $A$ from each of the
countably many sets $N_{1/(k+1)}(x) \cap A$, and this library has no canonical
rule for that selection, so the axiom of countable choice is invoked
explicitly at step 2.2 and nowhere else.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a real $x$. Sequences are functions on $\mathbb{N}$, which contains $0$, so a sequence is $(a_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ and the radii used below are $1/(k+1)$ rather than $1/k$ ([[def-sequence]]).

[L1] $\overline{A}$ is exactly the set of adherent points of $A$, that is, of points every neighbourhood of which meets $A$; and $A$ is closed exactly when $A = \overline{A}$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L2] $N_\varepsilon(x) = \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}$ for real $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L3] $(a_k) \to x$ means: for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|a_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$ ([[def-real-limit]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L4] Strictly between any two reals lies a rational; in particular for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a rational $q$ with $0 < q < \varepsilon$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L5] Reciprocal Archimedean property: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]]).

[L6] Canonical naturals: $n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ and $m \le n$ in $\mathbb{N}$ gives $m \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} \le n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]); a positive element has a positive inverse and $0 < a \le b$ gives $0 < 1/b \le 1/a$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

[L7] Countable choice: for every family $(X_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of nonempty sets there is a function $f$ with domain $\mathbb{N}$ such that $f(k) \in X_k$ for every $k$ ([[def-countable-choice]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For the right-to-left implication, assume $a_k \in A$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and $a_k \to x$, and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real. [assume-hyp, L3]

1.2 For the left-to-right implication, assume $x \in \overline{A}$; then for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ the radius $1/(k+1)$ is a positive real and the set $X_k := N_{1/(k+1)}(x) \cap A$ is nonempty, because $x$ is an adherent point of $A$ by [L1]. [assume-hyp, L1, L2, L6]

2.1 Fix a rational $q$ with $0 < q < \varepsilon$ by [L4], and then $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|a_k - x| < q$ for all $k \ge K$ by [L3]; in particular $|a_K - x| < q < \varepsilon$, so $a_K \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ and that intersection is nonempty. As $\varepsilon$ was an arbitrary positive real, $x$ is an adherent point of $A$, hence $x \in \overline{A}$ by [L1]. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L3, L4, choose]

2.2 Apply [L7] to the family $(X_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of step 1.2 and fix $f$ with $f(k) \in X_k$ for every $k$; putting $a_k := f(k)$ gives a sequence with $a_k \in A$ and $|a_k - x| < 1/(k+1)$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 1.2, L2, L7, choose]

3.1 That sequence converges to $x$: let $\varepsilon > 0$ be rational, fix by [L5] a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$, and put $K := n - 1$, a natural number since $n \ge 1$; for every $k \ge K$ one has $k + 1 \ge n \ge 1$, hence $0 < 1/(k+1) \le 1/n < \varepsilon$ by [L6], and therefore $|a_k - x| < 1/(k+1) < \varepsilon$. [step 2.2, L3, L5, L6, choose]

4.1 Step 2.1 gives the implication from right to left and steps 2.2 and 3.1 give it from left to right, so $x \in \overline{A}$ holds exactly when some sequence with all terms in $A$ converges to $x$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1]

4.2 Sequential closedness: if $A$ is closed and a sequence with all terms in $A$ converges to some $y$, then $y \in \overline{A}$ by step 2.1 and $\overline{A} = A$ by [L1], so $y \in A$; conversely, if every convergent sequence with terms in $A$ has its limit in $A$, then any $y \in \overline{A}$ is the limit of the sequence produced by steps 2.2 and 3.1, hence lies in $A$, so $\overline{A} \subseteq A$, and with $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ this gives $A = \overline{A}$, that is, $A$ is closed. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, L1]

5.1 Both assertions of the statement are proved, namely the sequential description of the closure in step 4.1 and the equivalence of closedness with sequential closedness in step 4.2. [step 4.1, step 4.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the choice is spent, and why it cannot be avoided here.** Step 2.2 is
  the only appeal to [[def-countable-choice]]. A canonical selection would
  require a rule picking a distinguished element of an arbitrary nonempty subset
  of $\mathbb{R}$, and $\mathbb{R}$ carries no well-ordering that this library
  has constructed, so this library has no such rule to offer. Contrast
  [[lem-subset-of-countable]] and [[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]], where
  the selection is from subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ and the least element is
  canonical.

- **The choice is genuinely confined to one direction.** Step 2.1 selects a
  single rational $q$ and a single index $K$ for one $\varepsilon$ at a time, and
  finitely many selections need no choice principle. So "the limit of a
  convergent sequence in a closed set lies in the set" is a theorem of ZF, and
  only the production of a sequence out of a point of the closure is not.

- **The indices start at $0$.** Since $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
  ([[def-sequence]]), the shrinking radii are $1/(k+1)$ and not $1/k$; the
  latter is undefined at $k = 0$. The threshold in step 3.1 is $K = n - 1$ for
  the same reason, and $n \ge 1$ is exactly what makes $K$ a natural number.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with closure $\overline{A}$ as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]] and derived set $A'$ as in
[[def-limit-point-r]]. Write

$$E \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing \text{ for every real } \varepsilon > 0 \,\}$$

for the set of adherent points of $A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). Then:

1. $\overline{A} = E$.
2. $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$.
3. $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed superset of $A$: it is closed, it
   contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed $F$ with $A \subseteq F$.
4. $A$ is closed if and only if $A = \overline{A}$, if and only if
   $A' \subseteq A$.

Claim 3 is the content of the definition of $\overline{A}$ and is restated here
so that the four descriptions stand together; claims 1, 2 and 4 are the ones
that carry work.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, and the set $E$ of adherent points of $A$ as displayed in the Statement.

[L1] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; $F$ is closed when $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L2] $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$; $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) = N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$; and if $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ then $\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ and $N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] $\overline{A}$ is the intersection of the nonempty family of closed supersets of $A$; it is closed, it contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed superset of $A$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]).

[L4] $x$ is an adherent point of $A$ when every $N_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $A$, a limit point when every $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $A$, and $A'$ is the set of limit points ([[def-limit-point-r]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $A \subseteq E$: for $x \in A$ and any $\varepsilon > 0$ one has $x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$, so that intersection is nonempty. [L2, L4]

1.2 Let $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus E$; by the definition of $E$ there is a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$. [L4, choose]

1.3 Let $F$ be closed with $A \subseteq F$, and let $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus F$; since $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open there is a real $\eta > 0$ with $N_\eta(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus F$. [L1, choose]

2.1 For every $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ the radius $\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x|$ is positive and $N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, so $N_\delta(y) \cap A = \varnothing$ and $y \notin E$; hence $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$, and since $x$ was an arbitrary point of $\mathbb{R} \setminus E$ that set is open, that is, $E$ is closed. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L4]

2.2 From $N_\eta(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus F \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus A$ we get $N_\eta(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, so $x \notin E$; hence $\mathbb{R} \setminus F \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$, that is, $E \subseteq F$, for every closed $F \supseteq A$. [step 1.3, L4]

3.1 By steps 1.1 and 2.1 the set $E$ is a closed superset of $A$, so $\overline{A} \subseteq E$ by the leastness in [L3]; and $\overline{A}$ is itself a closed superset of $A$ by [L3], so step 2.2 applied to $F = \overline{A}$ gives $E \subseteq \overline{A}$. Hence $\overline{A} = E$, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, L3]

4.1 $E = A \cup A'$: if $x \in E$ and $x \notin A$ then for every $\varepsilon > 0$ some $a \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ exists, and $a \ne x$ because $x \notin A$, so $a \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ and $x \in A'$; conversely $A \subseteq E$ by step 1.1, and $A' \subseteq E$ because $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$. Combining with step 3.1 gives $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$, which is claim 2. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L2, L4]

5.1 Claim 4: if $A$ is closed then $A$ is a closed superset of itself, so $\overline{A} \subseteq A$ by [L3], while $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ by [L3], whence $A = \overline{A}$; conversely if $A = \overline{A}$ then $A$ is closed because $\overline{A}$ is. Finally $A = \overline{A}$ says $A = A \cup A'$ by step 4.1, and $A = A \cup A'$ holds exactly when $A' \subseteq A$. [step 4.1, L3]

6.1 Claim 3 is [L3] restated, and claims 1, 2 and 4 are steps 3.1, 4.1 and 5.1, so all four hold. [step 3.1, step 4.1, step 5.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Which claim does the work in practice.** Claim 1 is the one used almost
  everywhere below: to show a point lies in $\overline{A}$ one exhibits, for each
  $\varepsilon > 0$, a point of $A$ within $\varepsilon$ of it. Claim 2 is what
  separates the two ways a point can be adherent, by membership or by
  accumulation, and it is what makes the notion of an isolated point visible.

- **No special property of $\mathbb{R}$ is used.** The argument uses the
  definitions of open, closed, neighbourhood and closure, and the order enters
  only through the nesting property of neighbourhoods; neither the
  least-upper-bound property nor the Archimedean property appears at any step.
  The results of this page that do use them are flagged in
  [[rem-r-native-topology-scope]].

- **The sequential form is a separate theorem and costs more.** Replacing
  "every neighbourhood meets $A$" by "some sequence in $A$ converges to $x$" is
  [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]], and the passage from the
  first to the second spends the axiom of countable choice, since it selects one
  point of $A$ from each of infinitely many neighbourhoods. The characterisation
  proved above is choice free.

## Statement

Let $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $E$ is connected ([[def-connected-r]]) if and
only if $E$ is **order-convex** ([[def-interval]]), that is, if and only if

$$x, z \in E \text{ and } x \le w \le z \;\Longrightarrow\; w \in E .$$

**On the word "interval".** Order-convexity is exactly the defining property
that [[def-interval]] proves for each of its nine forms, and in that sense the
theorem says that the connected subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ are the intervals. The
converse classification, that every order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty
or one of the nine forms, is true and is explicitly **not proved anywhere in
this library**; [[def-interval]] records that omission in its own remarks. So
the statement proved below is the equivalence with order-convexity, and the
phrase "is an interval" is to be read as "is order-convex" throughout this page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] Separated sets, disconnection, connectedness; separated sets are disjoint ([[def-connected-r]]).

[L2] $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed superset of $A$, so $A \subseteq B$ gives $\overline{A} \subseteq \overline{B}$ and $\overline{A} \subseteq F$ for every closed $F \supseteq A$; and $\overline{A}$ is exactly the set of points every neighbourhood of which meets $A$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]).

[L3] Order-convexity, and the interval forms: $(-\infty,w]$ and $[w,\infty)$ are closed sets, $(-\infty,w)$ and $(w,\infty)$ are open sets, and the order is total and transitive ([[def-interval]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L4] Least-upper-bound property: a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ bounded above has a unique least upper bound ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-sup-unique]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L5] Epsilon characterisation: for nonempty $S$ bounded above and $c = \sup S$, every $\varepsilon > 0$ admits $s \in S$ with $c - \varepsilon < s$ ([[lem-sup-epsilon]]).

[L6] $N_\varepsilon(x) = \{\, y : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L7] Every nonempty finite set of reals has a minimum, which is one of its members ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L8] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 := 1+1 > 0$ and $2^{-1} > 0$; for $d > 0$ one has $0 < d \cdot 2^{-1} < d$; adding a constant preserves an inequality ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Suppose $E$ is not order-convex: there are $x, z \in E$ and $w \in \mathbb{R}$ with $x \le w \le z$ and $w \notin E$; then $w \ne x$ and $w \ne z$, so $x < w < z$. Put $A := E \cap (-\infty,w)$ and $B := E \cap (w,\infty)$; then $x \in A$ and $z \in B$, so both are nonempty, and $A \cup B = E$ because no element of $E$ equals $w$. [assume-hyp, L3]

1.2 Suppose instead that $E$ is order-convex and that $(A,B)$ is a disconnection of $E$; fix $p \in A$ and $q \in B$. Separated sets are disjoint by [L1], so $p \ne q$, and interchanging the names $A$ and $B$ if necessary, which is legitimate because the hypotheses on the pair are symmetric, we may assume $p < q$. [assume-hyp, L1, choose]

1.3 For a nonempty $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ bounded above, $\sup S \in \overline{S}$: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the fact [L5] supplies $s \in S$ with $\sup S - \varepsilon < s \le \sup S$, so $|s - \sup S| < \varepsilon$ and $s \in N_\varepsilon(\sup S) \cap S$; thus every neighbourhood of $\sup S$ meets $S$, and [L2] gives $\sup S \in \overline{S}$. [L2, L4, L5, L6]

2.1 In the situation of step 1.1 the pair $(A,B)$ is a disconnection: $(-\infty,w]$ is a closed set containing $A$, so $\overline{A} \subseteq (-\infty,w]$ by [L2], whence $\overline{A} \cap B \subseteq (-\infty,w] \cap (w,\infty) = \varnothing$; symmetrically $\overline{B} \subseteq [w,\infty)$ and $A \cap \overline{B} = \varnothing$. So $A$ and $B$ are separated, nonempty, and their union is $E$, and $E$ is disconnected. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L3]

2.2 In the situation of step 1.2 put $S := A \cap [p,q]$; it is nonempty because $p \in A$ and $p \le p \le q$, and it is bounded above by $q$, so $c := \sup S$ exists by [L4], and $p \le c \le q$ since $p \in S$ and $q$ is an upper bound. [step 1.2, L3, L4]

3.1 $c \in A$: from $S \subseteq A$ and [L2] we get $\overline{S} \subseteq \overline{A}$, and $c \in \overline{S}$ by step 1.3, so $c \in \overline{A}$ and hence $c \notin B$ because $\overline{A} \cap B = \varnothing$; on the other hand $p \le c \le q$ with $p, q \in E$ and $E$ order-convex gives $c \in E = A \cup B$, so $c \in A$. [step 1.2, step 1.3, step 2.2, L1, L2]

4.1 $c < q$, since $c \in A$ and $q \in B$ are distinct by [L1] while $c \le q$; and every $v$ with $c < v \le q$ lies in $B$: such a $v$ satisfies $p \le c < v \le q$, so $v \in E$ by order-convexity, and $v \notin A$, for otherwise $v \in A \cap [p,q] = S$ would force $v \le c$. [step 1.2, step 2.2, step 3.1, L1, L3]

5.1 $c \in \overline{B}$, which is impossible: given a real $\varepsilon > 0$, put $t := \min\{\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1},\ (q - c) \cdot 2^{-1}\}$, a positive real by [L7] and [L8] since $q - c > 0$, and $v := c + t$; then $c < v$ and $v \le c + (q-c) \cdot 2^{-1} < q$, so $v \in B$ by step 4.1, while $|v - c| = t \le \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} < \varepsilon$, so $v \in N_\varepsilon(c) \cap B$. Hence every neighbourhood of $c$ meets $B$ and $c \in \overline{B}$ by [L2]; but $c \in A$ by step 3.1 and $A \cap \overline{B} = \varnothing$ by [L1]. So the assumed disconnection cannot exist and an order-convex $E$ is connected. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L1, L2, L6, L7, L8]

6.1 Step 2.1 shows that a set which is not order-convex is disconnected, hence a connected set is order-convex; step 5.1 shows that an order-convex set admits no disconnection, hence is connected. The two together are the asserted equivalence. [step 2.1, step 5.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where completeness is spent.** Only in step 2.2, which produces
  $\sup(A \cap [p,q])$; no other step uses the least-upper-bound property, and
  the rest is the order, ordered-field arithmetic and the definition of
  separation. The obstruction over an incomplete ordered field is traceable to
  the failure of that supremum to exist, and it is visible in
  [[cex-rationals-in-an-interval-are-disconnected]]: the set
  $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,2]$ contains all the rationals between its endpoints and is
  nevertheless disconnected as a subset of $\mathbb{R}$, split at an irrational
  point that $\mathbb{Q}$ does not see.

- **The two directions are of different characters.** "Not order-convex implies
  disconnected" is a construction, step 1.1, and needs nothing beyond the order.
  "Order-convex implies connected" is where the work sits, and the supremum
  $c$ produced in step 2.2 is the point at which the two pieces would have to
  meet; the contradiction is that it is adherent to both.

- **The theorem is about subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ and its statement is written in
