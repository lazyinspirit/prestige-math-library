## Statement

Let $K = \mathbb{R}((t^{-1}))$ be the ordered field of
[[thm-laurent-ordered-field]], and identify a natural number with its image in
$\mathbb{Z}$ when it is used as an index. Then:

1. $n \cdot 1_K < t$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$; consequently $K$ is **not**
   Archimedean ([[def-archimedean-field]]).
2. $0_K < t^{-(k+1)} < t^{-k}$ for every $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.
3. **(Countable cofinality.)** For every $\varepsilon \in K$ with
   $\varepsilon > 0_K$ there is $k \in \mathbb{N}$ with
   $0_K < t^{-k} < \varepsilon$; indeed every integer $k > v(\varepsilon)$
   works.
4. **(The monomials measure the valuation.)** For $h \in K$ and $k \in
   \mathbb{Z}$: if $h(j) = 0$ for every $j \le k$ then $|h| < t^{-k}$; and
   conversely, if $|h| < t^{-k}$ then $h(j) = 0$ for every $j < k$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $K$ with its valuation $v$, leading coefficient $\operatorname{lc}$, monomials $t^{-a}$ and constants $\iota(c)$.

[L1] For nonzero $h \in K$, $h(k) = 0$ for $k < v(h)$ and $h(v(h)) = \operatorname{lc}(h) \ne 0$; $t^{-a}$ is $1$ at index $a$ and $0$ elsewhere, so $t^{-a} \ne 0_K$ with $v(t^{-a}) = a$ and $\operatorname{lc}(t^{-a}) = 1$; and $t = t^{-(-1)}$ ([[def-formal-laurent-series]]).

[L2] $K$ is an ordered field in which $f < g$ holds exactly when $g - f \ne 0_K$ and $\operatorname{lc}(g-f) > 0$; for $f \ne 0_K$ one has $|f| \ne 0_K$, $v(|f|) = v(f)$ and $\operatorname{lc}(|f|) > 0$; and $n \cdot 1_K = \iota(n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}})$, which for $n \ge 1$ is nonzero with $v = 0$ ([[thm-laurent-ordered-field]], [[def-abs-value]]).

[L3] For nonzero $f, g \in K$: $-f \ne 0_K$ with $v(-f) = v(f)$; and if $v(f) < v(g)$ then $f + g \ne 0_K$ with $\operatorname{lc}(f+g) = \operatorname{lc}(f)$ ([[lem-laurent-valuation]]).

[L4] An ordered field $F$ is Archimedean when for every $x \in F$ there is a natural $n$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$; and in an ordered field exactly one of $x < y$, $x = y$, $y < x$ holds ([[def-archimedean-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] The order on $\mathbb{Z}$ is total, and every integer $\ge 0$ is the image of a unique natural number; so for every $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ there is a natural $k$ whose image exceeds $m$ ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]], [[def-int-order]], [[lem-nat-embeds-int]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For every $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ the monomial $t^{-k}$ is nonzero with $\operatorname{lc}(t^{-k}) = 1 > 0$, so $t^{-k} > 0_K$ by [L2]; and since $v(t^{-k}) = k < k+1 = v(-t^{-(k+1)})$ by [L1] and [L3], the difference $t^{-k} - t^{-(k+1)}$ is nonzero with leading coefficient $\operatorname{lc}(t^{-k}) = 1 > 0$, so $t^{-(k+1)} < t^{-k}$. [L1, L2, L3]

1.2 Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. If $n = 0$ then $t - n \cdot 1_K = t$, which is nonzero with $\operatorname{lc}(t) = 1 > 0$. If $n \ge 1$ then $n \cdot 1_K$ is nonzero with $v(n \cdot 1_K) = 0$, so $-(n\cdot 1_K)$ is nonzero with valuation $0$ by [L3], while $v(t) = -1 < 0$; hence $t - n\cdot 1_K$ is nonzero with leading coefficient $\operatorname{lc}(t) = 1 > 0$ by [L3]. In both cases $n \cdot 1_K < t$ by [L2]. [L1, L2, L3]

1.3 Conversely, let $h \in K$ and $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $|h| < t^{-k}$, and suppose $h \ne 0_K$ with $v(h) < k$. Then $v(|h|) = v(h) < k = v(t^{-k})$ and $\operatorname{lc}(|h|) > 0$ by [L2], so $|h| - t^{-k}$ is nonzero with leading coefficient $\operatorname{lc}(|h|) > 0$ by [L3], giving $t^{-k} < |h|$ and contradicting $|h| < t^{-k}$ by the trichotomy of [L4]. Hence $h = 0_K$ or $v(h) \ge k$, and in either case $h(j) = 0$ for every $j < k$ by [L1]. [L1, L2, L3, L4]

2.1 Let $h \in K$ and $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $h(j) = 0$ for every $j \le k$. If $h = 0_K$ then $|h| = 0_K < t^{-k}$ by [step 1.1]. Otherwise $h \ne 0_K$ with $v(h) > k$, so $|h| \ne 0_K$ with $v(|h|) = v(h) > k = v(t^{-k})$ by [L1] and [L2]; then $t^{-k} - |h|$ is nonzero with leading coefficient $\operatorname{lc}(t^{-k}) = 1 > 0$ by [L3], so $|h| < t^{-k}$ by [L2]. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L3]

2.2 Let $\varepsilon \in K$ with $\varepsilon > 0_K$, so $\varepsilon \ne 0_K$ and $\operatorname{lc}(\varepsilon) > 0$ by [L2]; put $m := v(\varepsilon)$ and use [L5] to fix a natural $k$ with $k > m$. Then $v(\varepsilon) = m < k = v(t^{-k}) = v(-t^{-k})$ by [L1] and [L3], so $\varepsilon - t^{-k}$ is nonzero with leading coefficient $\operatorname{lc}(\varepsilon) > 0$, that is $t^{-k} < \varepsilon$; and $t^{-k} > 0_K$ by [step 1.1]. The same computation applies to every integer $k > m$. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L3, L5]

2.3 By [step 1.2], $n \cdot 1_K < t$ for every natural $n$; by the trichotomy of [L4] no natural $n$ can then satisfy $t < n \cdot 1_K$, so the defining condition of [L4] fails at $x = t$ and $K$ is not Archimedean. [step 1.2, L4]

3.1 Clause 1 is [step 1.2] with [step 2.3], clause 2 is [step 1.1], clause 3 is [step 2.2], and clause 4 is [step 2.1] together with [step 1.3]. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 1.3, step 2.2, step 2.3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why clause 3 is the pivotal one.** The valuation takes its values in
  $\mathbb{Z}$, which has countable cofinality, and clause 3 is the translation
  of that fact into the order of $K$: a *countable* family, the monomials
  $t^{-k}$ with $k \in \mathbb{N}$, already gets below every positive element.
  This is what makes the sequential Cauchy condition in $K$ testable against
  countably many thresholds, and it is the reason a sequence indexed by
  $\mathbb{N}$ suffices to reach a limit in [[thm-laurent-cauchy-complete]].
  Nothing like it would hold if the exponents were allowed to range over a
  group of uncountable cofinality.

- **Non-Archimedean here is a statement about $t$, not about the constants.**
  The canonical naturals of $K$ are the constant series
  $n \cdot 1_K = \iota(n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}})$ (clause 3 of
  [[thm-laurent-ordered-field]]), all of valuation $0$, and what bounds them
  above is $t$, of valuation $-1$. The computation in step 1.2 uses nothing
  about $t$ beyond that: every *positive* element of negative valuation exceeds
  every canonical natural, because a strict inequality between valuations
  decides the comparison outright, whatever the coefficients are.

## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]). The **absolute value** of
$x \in F$ is

$$|x| \;:=\; \begin{cases} x & \text{if } x \ge 0, \\ -x & \text{if } x < 0. \end{cases}$$

## Remarks

- The distance between $x$ and $y$ is $|x - y|$.
- The basic algebraic properties ($|x| \ge 0$, $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$,
  $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$, and the characterisation $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$) are
  established in [[lem-of-abs-value]]; the triangle inequality is
  [[lem-of-triangle-inequality]].

## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]). For a natural number
$n \ge 1$, write $n \cdot 1_F := \underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$ for the
$n$-fold sum of the multiplicative identity, and $0 \cdot 1_F := 0$. These are
the **canonical natural numbers** of $F$.

$F$ is **Archimedean** if for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n$ with

$$x < n \cdot 1_F.$$

Equivalently, the canonical naturals $(n \cdot 1_F)_{n \ge 1}$ are **cofinal**:
no single element of $F$ is an upper bound for all of them.

## Remarks

- Equivalently (applying the definition to $1/\varepsilon$): for every
  $\varepsilon > 0$ in $F$ there is $n$ with $1/(n \cdot 1_F) < \varepsilon$, so
  the canonical fractions $1/n$ are arbitrarily small.
- That the canonical naturals are well-defined, positive, and strictly
  increasing is [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]. Every complete ordered field is
  Archimedean ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); an ordered field need not be
  ([[cex-ordered-field-not-archimedean]]).

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the field of real numbers with its order
([[def-real-numbers]], [[thm-reals-ordered-field]]) and $\mathbb{Z}$ is the
totally ordered commutative ring of integers ([[def-integers]],
[[def-int-operations]], [[def-int-order]], [[thm-int-ordered-ring]]).

For a function $f : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R}$ write

$$\operatorname{supp} f \;:=\; \{\, k \in \mathbb{Z} : f(k) \ne 0 \,\},$$

and say that $\operatorname{supp} f$ is **bounded below** when there is
$m \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $f(k) = 0$ for every $k < m$. The set of **formal Laurent
series in $t^{-1}$ over $\mathbb{R}$** is

$$K \;=\; \mathbb{R}((t^{-1})) \;:=\; \{\, f : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R} \;\mid\; \operatorname{supp} f \text{ is bounded below} \,\},$$

equipped with

$$(f + g)(k) := f(k) + g(k), \qquad (fg)(k) := \sum_{i + j = k} f(i)\,g(j),$$

where the product sum ranges over the pairs $(i,j) \in \mathbb{Z} \times
\mathbb{Z}$ with $i + j = k$ and $f(i)g(j) \ne 0$. That set of pairs is finite
for every $k$, and $f + g$ and $fg$ again lie in $K$: this is
[[lem-laurent-series-ring]], which also proves that $K$ with these operations is
a commutative ring whose zero $0_K$ is the constant function $0$ and whose
identity $1_K$ is the function taking the value $1$ at $0$ and $0$ elsewhere.

**Distinguished elements.** For $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ let $t^{-n} \in K$ be the
function taking the value $1$ at $n$ and $0$ at every other index; so
$t^{0} = 1_K$, and $t := t^{-(-1)}$ is the function taking the value $1$ at $-1$.
For $c \in \mathbb{R}$ let $\iota(c) \in K$ be the function taking the value $c$
at $0$ and $0$ elsewhere. The notation $t^{-n}$ is *defined* here as a name;
that it is consistent with the ring multiplication, $t^{-m} \, t^{-n} =
t^{-(m+n)}$, is proved in [[lem-laurent-series-ring]].

**Series notation.** Because $\operatorname{supp} f$ is bounded below, say by
$m$, one writes

$$f \;=\; \sum_{k \ge m} f(k)\, t^{-k},$$

a purely notational device: the object is the function $f$, and no convergence
of any kind is asserted or used.

**Valuation and leading coefficient.** Let $f \in K$ with $f \ne 0_K$. Then
$\operatorname{supp} f$ is nonempty and bounded below, so it has a least element
([[lem-laurent-series-ring]]). Define

$$v(f) \;:=\; \min \operatorname{supp} f \in \mathbb{Z}, \qquad \operatorname{lc}(f) \;:=\; f(v(f)) \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}.$$

$v(f)$ is the **valuation** and $\operatorname{lc}(f)$ the **leading
coefficient** of $f$. Neither is defined at $f = 0_K$, whose support is empty;
every statement about $v$ or $\operatorname{lc}$ in this library carries the
hypothesis $f \ne 0_K$ explicitly.

**Order.** The **positive cone** of $K$ is

$$P \;:=\; \{\, f \in K : f \ne 0_K \text{ and } \operatorname{lc}(f) > 0 \,\},$$

that is, a nonzero series is positive exactly when its lowest-index nonzero
coefficient is a positive real. That $(K, P)$ is an ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]) is [[thm-laurent-ordered-field]], and
that every nonzero element of $K$ is invertible is
[[thm-laurent-series-field]]. As in any ordered field, $f < g$ means
$g - f \in P$.

## Remarks

- **Why the support must be bounded below.** It is exactly what makes the
  product a finite sum. If arbitrary functions $\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R}$ were
  admitted, the defining sum for $(fg)(k)$ would range over an infinite set of
  pairs and would denote nothing, since $K$ carries no notion of convergence.
  The condition is preserved by both operations, which is the content of
  [[lem-laurent-series-ring]].

- **Indices run over all of $\mathbb{Z}$, and the edge cases are real.** The zero
  series has empty support and no valuation. A nonzero constant series
  $\iota(c)$ has $v(\iota(c)) = 0$ and $\operatorname{lc}(\iota(c)) = c$, so the
  index $k = 0$ is an ordinary index and not a boundary. Negative indices are
  admitted, and they are what makes $t = t^{-(-1)}$, whose support is $\{-1\}$,
  an element of $K$; a series may have finitely many terms of negative index but
  never infinitely many.

- **The order is not the coefficientwise order.** Two series are compared by
  their *lowest* differing coefficient, not by all of them at once, and this is
  what makes $t^{-1}$ smaller than every positive real constant while $t$ is
  larger than every real constant. The consequences are drawn in
  [[lem-laurent-non-archimedean]].

- **Relation to the rational functions.** The ordered field $\mathbb{R}(t)$ of
  [[cex-ordered-field-not-archimedean]], ordered so that $f > 0$ exactly when
  $f(x) > 0$ for all sufficiently large real $x$, is the standard first example
  of a non-Archimedean ordered field, and standard treatments identify it with a
  subfield of $K$ by expanding each rational function at infinity. **This page
  neither constructs that identification nor uses it**, and no item here may be
  cited for it: everything proved about $K$ below is proved from the definition
  above and nothing else. What the two objects share, and all that is used here,
  is the idea of ordering by behaviour at infinity.

## Definition

For integers $x = [(a,b)]$ and $y = [(c,d)]$ ([[def-integers]]) define

$$x \le y \iff a + d \le b + c \quad \text{in } \mathbb{N}.$$

Write $x < y$ when $x \le y$ and $x \ne y$. An integer $x$ is **positive**
when $0 < x$; on representatives, $0 < [(a,b)]$ exactly when $b < a$.

## Remarks

- The defining inequality is "$a - b \le c - d$" restated without subtraction.
- Well-definedness, totality, and compatibility with the arithmetic are proved
  in [[thm-int-ordered-ring]].

## Definition

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ ([[def-field]]) together with a subset
$P \subseteq F$, the set of **positive** elements (the *positive cone*),
satisfying:

- **(O1) Trichotomy.** For each $x \in F$, exactly one of the following holds:
  $x \in P$, or $x = 0$, or $-x \in P$.
- **(O2) Closure.** If $x, y \in P$ then $x + y \in P$ and $x \cdot y \in P$.

We write $x > 0$ for $x \in P$ (read "$x$ is positive"), and define the order by

$$a < b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; b - a \in P, \qquad a \le b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; a < b \text{ or } a = b.$$

Thus $a > b$ means $b < a$, and $a \ge b$ means $b \le a$. An element $x$ with
$-x \in P$ (equivalently $x < 0$) is called **negative**.

## Remarks

- By trichotomy applied to $b - a$, for any $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$,
  $a = b$, $a > b$ holds; this makes $\le$ a total order.
- (O2) says the positives are closed under addition and multiplication: sums and
  products of positives are positive.
- The rationals ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and both constructions of the reals
  ([[thm-reals-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-dedekind-ordered-field]]) are ordered
  fields, so every fact proved here from (O1)-(O2) holds in each of them.

## Statement

Let $K = \mathbb{R}((t^{-1}))$ with its valuation $v$ and leading coefficient
$\operatorname{lc}$ ([[def-formal-laurent-series]]), and let $f, g \in K$ with
$f \ne 0_K$ and $g \ne 0_K$. Then:

1. **(Products.)** $fg \ne 0_K$, and
   $$v(fg) = v(f) + v(g), \qquad \operatorname{lc}(fg) = \operatorname{lc}(f)\operatorname{lc}(g).$$
   In particular $K$ has no zero divisors.
2. **(Negatives.)** $-f \ne 0_K$, $v(-f) = v(f)$ and
   $\operatorname{lc}(-f) = -\operatorname{lc}(f)$.
3. **(Unequal valuations.)** If $v(f) < v(g)$ then $f + g \ne 0_K$,
   $v(f+g) = v(f)$ and $\operatorname{lc}(f+g) = \operatorname{lc}(f)$.
4. **(Equal valuations, no cancellation.)** If $v(f) = v(g) = q$ and
   $\operatorname{lc}(f) + \operatorname{lc}(g) \ne 0$, then $f + g \ne 0_K$,
   $v(f+g) = q$ and
   $\operatorname{lc}(f+g) = \operatorname{lc}(f) + \operatorname{lc}(g)$.
5. **(Sums in general.)** If $f + g \ne 0_K$ then
   $v(f+g) \ge \min\{v(f), v(g)\}$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $f, g \in K$ with $f \ne 0_K$ and $g \ne 0_K$; write $p := v(f)$ and $q := v(g)$.

[L1] For a nonzero $h \in K$ one has $h(k) = 0$ for every $k < v(h)$ and $h(v(h)) = \operatorname{lc}(h) \ne 0$; conversely, if $h(k) = 0$ for all $k < r$ and $h(r) \ne 0$ then $h \ne 0_K$, $v(h) = r$ and $\operatorname{lc}(h) = h(r)$ ([[def-formal-laurent-series]]).

[L2] $(f+g)(k) = f(k) + g(k)$ and $(fg)(k) = \sum_{i+j=k} f(i)g(j)$, a finite sum; if $f$ vanishes at every index below $m$ and $g$ at every index below $n$, then $fg$ vanishes at every index below $m+n$ ([[lem-laurent-series-ring]], [[def-formal-laurent-series]]).

[L3] $\mathbb{R}$ is a field, so a product of two nonzero reals is nonzero, and $-x = 0$ only for $x = 0$ ([[def-field]], [[thm-reals-ordered-field]]).

[L4] The order on $\mathbb{Z}$ is total and compatible with addition ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]], [[def-int-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L1] $f$ vanishes at every index below $p$ and $g$ at every index below $q$, so by [L2] $(fg)(k) = 0$ for every $k < p + q$. [L1, L2]

1.2 If $(i,j)$ satisfies $i + j = p+q$ and $f(i)g(j) \ne 0$ then $i \ge p$ and $j \ge q$ by [L1], and $i + j = p + q$ then forces $i = p$ and $j = q$; hence $(fg)(p+q) = f(p)g(q) = \operatorname{lc}(f)\operatorname{lc}(g)$, which is nonzero by [L3]. [L1, L2, L3, L4]

1.3 $(-f)(k) = -f(k)$ for every $k$, so $-f$ vanishes exactly where $f$ does; by [L1] and [L3] this gives $-f \ne 0_K$, $v(-f) = p$ and $\operatorname{lc}(-f) = -\operatorname{lc}(f) \ne 0$. [L1, L2, L3]

1.4 Suppose $p < q$. For $k < p$ both $f(k) = 0$ and $g(k) = 0$, so $(f+g)(k) = 0$; and $g(p) = 0$ because $p < q$, so $(f+g)(p) = \operatorname{lc}(f) \ne 0$. By [L1], $f + g \ne 0_K$ with $v(f+g) = p$ and $\operatorname{lc}(f+g) = \operatorname{lc}(f)$. [L1, L2, L4]

1.5 Suppose $p = q$ and $\operatorname{lc}(f) + \operatorname{lc}(g) \ne 0$. For $k < p$ both terms vanish, so $(f+g)(k) = 0$; and $(f+g)(p) = \operatorname{lc}(f) + \operatorname{lc}(g) \ne 0$. By [L1], $f+g \ne 0_K$, $v(f+g) = p$ and $\operatorname{lc}(f+g) = \operatorname{lc}(f) + \operatorname{lc}(g)$. [L1, L2]

1.6 For $k < \min\{p,q\}$ one has $f(k) = g(k) = 0$, hence $(f+g)(k) = 0$; so if $f + g \ne 0_K$ then its valuation, being the least index at which it is nonzero, satisfies $v(f+g) \ge \min\{p,q\}$. [L1, L2, L4]

2.1 By [step 1.1] $fg$ vanishes at every index below $p+q$ and by [step 1.2] it is nonzero at $p+q$; so by [L1] $fg \ne 0_K$, $v(fg) = p + q$ and $\operatorname{lc}(fg) = \operatorname{lc}(f)\operatorname{lc}(g)$. Since $f$ and $g$ were arbitrary nonzero elements, no product of nonzero elements of $K$ is zero. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1]

3.1 Clause 1 is [step 2.1], clause 2 is [step 1.3], clause 3 is [step 1.4], clause 4 is [step 1.5] and clause 5 is [step 1.6]. [step 1.3, step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6, step 2.1] ∎

## Statement

The map $\iota(n) = [(n,0)]$ is injective and preserves addition,
multiplication, and order. Its image is exactly the set of nonnegative
integers, so every $x \ge 0$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ is $\iota(k)$ for a unique
natural $k$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The map $\iota : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$, $\iota(n) = [(n,0)]$.

[A1] Arithmetic identities in $\mathbb{N}$: $x + 0 = x$, $0 + x = x$, $x \cdot 0 = 0$, $0 \cdot x = 0$, $x \cdot 1 = x$.

[A2] The order on $\mathbb{N}$, and: $x \le y$ iff $y = x + k$ for some $k$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Injectivity: $[(m,0)] = [(n,0)]$ means $m + 0 = 0 + n$, i.e. $m = n$. [A1]

1.2 Addition: $\iota(m) + \iota(n) = [(m+n,\, 0+0)] = \iota(m+n)$. [A1]

1.3 Multiplication: $\iota(m)\,\iota(n) = [(mn + 0 \cdot 0,\; m \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot n)] = \iota(mn)$. [A1]

1.4 Order: $\iota(m) \le \iota(n)$ reads $m + 0 \le 0 + n$, i.e. $m \le n$. [A1, A2]

1.5 Image: if $0 \le [(a,b)]$ then $b \le a$, so $a = b + k$ and $(a,b) \sim (k,0)$, giving $[(a,b)] = \iota(k)$; conversely $0 \le \iota(k)$ for every $k$. [A2, algebra]

2.1 $\iota$ embeds $\mathbb{N}$ into $\mathbb{Z}$, preserving arithmetic and order, with image the nonnegative integers. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, step 1.4, step 1.5] ∎

## Statement

The relation of [[def-int-order]] is well defined and is a total order on
$\mathbb{Z}$; it is compatible with addition ($x \le y$ implies
$x + z \le y + z$) and positives are closed under multiplication
($0 < x$ and $0 < y$ imply $0 < xy$). Thus $\mathbb{Z}$ is a totally
ordered commutative ring.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Integers $x = [(a,b)]$, $y = [(c,d)]$, $z = [(e,f)]$ with the operations of [[def-int-operations]].

[L1] Addition on $\mathbb{N}$ is commutative and associative ([[lem-nat-add-commutative]], [[lem-nat-add-associative]]).

[L2] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total, antisymmetric, and transitive ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

[L3] Natural order is translation-invariant: $x\le y\iff x+z\le y+z$ ([[lem-nat-order-add-compatible]]).

[L4] By the definition of natural order, $x\le y$ exactly when $y=x+k$ for some natural $k$; if $x<y$, such a gap is nonzero ([[def-nat-order]]).

[L5] Natural multiplication is commutative and associative, distributes over addition, and has the usual zero and identity laws; multiplication by a nonzero natural preserves strict order ([[lem-nat-mult-commutative]], [[lem-nat-mult-associative]], [[lem-nat-mult-distributive]], [[lem-nat-mult-identity]], [[lem-nat-order-mult-compatible]]).

[L6] The integer operations make $\mathbb{Z}$ a commutative ring with multiplicative identity ([[thm-int-comm-ring]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Suppose $(a,b) \sim (a',b')$ and $(c,d) \sim (c',d')$, i.e. $a + b' = b + a'$ and $c + d' = d + c'$. [given]

1.2 Suppose $a + d \le b + c$. [given]

1.3 Totality: in $\mathbb{N}$ either $a + d \le b + c$ or $b + c \le a + d$, so $x \le y$ or $y \le x$. [L2]

1.4 Antisymmetry: $x \le y$ and $y \le x$ give $a + d \le b + c$ and $b + c \le a + d$, hence $a + d = b + c$, which is $x = y$ as classes. [L2]

1.5 Transitivity: from $a + d \le b + c$ and $c + f \le d + e$, adding gives $(a+d)+(c+f) \le (b+c)+(d+e)$; regrouping, $(a+f)+(c+d) \le (b+e)+(c+d)$; cancelling, $a + f \le b + e$, i.e. $x \le z$. [L1, L2, L3]

1.6 Compatibility with addition: $x + z \le y + z$ reads $(a+e)+(d+f) \le (b+f)+(c+e)$, which regroups to $(a+d) + (e+f) \le (b+c) + (e+f)$, equivalent to $a + d \le b + c$, i.e. $x \le y$. [L1, L3]

1.7 Suppose $0 < x$ and $0 < y$, i.e. $b < a$ and $d < c$. [given]

2.1 Adding $(a'+d')$: $(a+d) + (a'+d') \le (b+c) + (a'+d')$. [step 1.2, L3]

2.2 Regrouping with the equations of step 1.1: $(b+c) + (a'+d') = (b+a') + (c+d') = (a+b') + (d+c') = (a+d) + (b'+c')$. [step 1.1, L1]

2.3 Write $a = b + k$ and $c = d + m$ with nonzero naturals $k,m$. [step 1.7, L4]

3.1 So $(a+d) + (a'+d') \le (a+d) + (b'+c')$; cancelling $(a+d)$ gives $a'+d'\le b'+c'$. Applying the same argument with primed and unprimed representatives exchanged proves the converse implication, so the relation is independent of representatives. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, L3]

3.2 Expanding both components of $xy = [(ac+bd,\, ad+bc)]$: $ac + bd = (b+k)(d+m) + bd = (bd + bm + kd + bd) + km$ and $ad + bc = (b+k)d + b(d+m) = bd + kd + bd + bm$, so $ac + bd = (ad + bc) + km$. [step 2.3, L1, L5]

4.1 Since $k,m$ are nonzero, $0<k$ and $0<m$ by [L4]. Hence [L5] gives $0=0\cdot m<km$, and step 3.2 yields $ad+bc<ac+bd$, which is $0<xy$. [step 2.3, step 3.2, L2, L4, L5]

5.1 The order is well defined, total, compatible with addition, and positives are closed under multiplication; together with [L6], this makes $\mathbb{Z}$ a totally ordered commutative ring. [step 3.1, step 1.3, step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6, step 4.1, L6] ∎

## Statement

Every sequence $(f^{(n)})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $K = \mathbb{R}((t^{-1}))$ that
is Cauchy in $K$ ([[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]]) converges in $K$. That
is, the ordered field $K$ of [[thm-laurent-ordered-field]] is **sequentially
Cauchy complete**.

The limit is built coefficient by coefficient: at each index $j \in \mathbb{Z}$
the real numbers $f^{(n)}(j)$ are eventually constant in $n$, and $L(j)$ is that
eventual value.

## Scratch

The whole theorem turns on one structural fact about $K$, and it is worth
isolating before the proof: **the value group is $\mathbb{Z}$, so it has
countable cofinality.** Concretely, the countably many monomials $t^{-k}$,
$k \in \mathbb{N}$, get below every positive element of $K$
([[lem-laurent-non-archimedean]], clause 3). Two consequences drive everything.

First, the Cauchy condition, which quantifies over the uncountably many positive
$\varepsilon \in K$, is *equivalent* to its restriction to the countable family
$\varepsilon = t^{-(k+1)}$, and by clause 4 of the same lemma that restricted
condition says exactly: for each $k$ the coefficients at all indices $j \le k$
are eventually constant along the sequence.

Second, a sequence indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ is long enough to reach the limit.
For each of the countably many thresholds $t^{-k}$ there is an index $N_k$ past
which the sequence is that close, and $\sup$-free bookkeeping over $\mathbb{N}$
assembles the $N_k$ into a single limit. In a field whose value group had
uncountable cofinality this last step would fail, and a sequence would not
suffice.

The one genuinely non-formal point is that the assembled $L$ must have support
bounded below, so that it is an element of $K$ at all. That does not follow from
the eventual constancy at each index separately; it comes from the *single*
threshold $k = 0$, which already pins down every negative index at once.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(f^{(n)})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $K$ that is Cauchy in $K$.

[L1] $K$ consists of the functions $\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R}$ whose support is bounded below; $t^{-a}$ is $1$ at index $a$ and $0$ elsewhere ([[def-formal-laurent-series]]).

[L2] $K$ is an ordered field, so its order is transitive and total ([[thm-laurent-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-abs-value]]); and $(g - h)(j) = g(j) - h(j)$ for $g, h \in K$ ([[lem-laurent-series-ring]]).

[L3] In $K$: $0_K < t^{-(k+1)} < t^{-k}$ for every $k \in \mathbb{Z}$; for every $\varepsilon > 0$ in $K$ there is $k \in \mathbb{N}$ with $t^{-k} < \varepsilon$; if $h(j) = 0$ for every $j \le k$ then $|h| < t^{-k}$; and if $|h| < t^{-k}$ then $h(j) = 0$ for every $j < k$ ([[lem-laurent-non-archimedean]]).

[L4] $(x_n)$ is Cauchy in $K$ when for every $\varepsilon > 0$ in $K$ there is $N \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_n - x_m| < \varepsilon$ for all $n, m \ge N$; and $(x_n)$ converges to $L$ in $K$ when for every $\varepsilon > 0$ in $K$ there is $N$ with $|x_n - L| < \varepsilon$ for all $n \ge N$ ([[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]]).

[L5] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L6] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total ([[thm-nat-linear-order]], [[def-nat-order]]), induction is available ([[thm-induction-principle]], [[def-natural-numbers]]), and every integer $\ge 0$ is the image of a unique natural number, so a natural number may be used as an index in $\mathbb{Z}$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 For $k \in \mathbb{N}$ put $M_k := \{\, N \in \mathbb{N} : |f^{(n)} - f^{(m)}| < t^{-(k+1)} \text{ for all } n, m \ge N \,\}$. Since $t^{-(k+1)} > 0_K$ by [L3] and the sequence is Cauchy, $M_k \ne \varnothing$ by [L4]; let $N_k := \min M_k$, which exists by [L5]. [given, L3, L4, L5, construct]

2.1 For every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, all $n, m \ge N_k$ and every $j \le k$ one has $f^{(n)}(j) = f^{(m)}(j)$: by [step 1.1] $|f^{(n)} - f^{(m)}| < t^{-(k+1)}$, so [L3] gives $(f^{(n)} - f^{(m)})(j) = 0$ for every $j < k+1$, that is for every $j \le k$, and $(f^{(n)} - f^{(m)})(j) = f^{(n)}(j) - f^{(m)}(j)$ by [L2]. [step 1.1, L2, L3, L6]

2.2 $N_a \le N_b$ whenever $a \le b$ in $\mathbb{N}$: for consecutive indices, $t^{-(k+2)} < t^{-(k+1)}$ by [L3], so any $N$ witnessing membership in $M_{k+1}$ also witnesses membership in $M_k$ by transitivity of the order [L2]; hence $M_{k+1} \subseteq M_k$ and $N_k = \min M_k \le \min M_{k+1} = N_{k+1}$. The general case follows by induction on $b$ [L6]. [step 1.1, L2, L3, L6]

2.3 Define $\kappa : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{N}$ by $\kappa(j) := j$ for $j \ge 0$ and $\kappa(j) := 0$ for $j < 0$, so that $j \le \kappa(j)$ for every $j \in \mathbb{Z}$; then define $L : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R}$ by $L(j) := f^{(N_{\kappa(j)})}(j)$. [step 1.1, L6, construct]

3.1 For every $j \in \mathbb{Z}$ and every $n \ge N_{\kappa(j)}$ one has $f^{(n)}(j) = L(j)$: apply [step 2.1] with $k = \kappa(j)$, which is legitimate since $j \le \kappa(j)$, to the two indices $n$ and $N_{\kappa(j)}$, both of which are $\ge N_{\kappa(j)}$. [step 2.1, step 2.3, L6]

3.2 $L \in K$. The series $f^{(N_0)}$ lies in $K$, so by [L1] there is $m_0 \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $f^{(N_0)}(j) = 0$ for every $j < m_0$. If $j < m_0$ and $j < 0$ then $\kappa(j) = 0$, so $L(j) = f^{(N_0)}(j) = 0$; hence $L(j) = 0$ for every $j$ below both $m_0$ and $0$, the support of $L$ is bounded below, and $L \in K$. [step 2.3, L1]

4.1 For every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, every $n \ge N_k$ and every $j \le k$ one has $f^{(n)}(j) = L(j)$: if $j \ge 0$ then $\kappa(j) = j \le k$, and if $j < 0$ then $\kappa(j) = 0 \le k$, so in both cases $N_{\kappa(j)} \le N_k \le n$ by [step 2.2] and [step 3.1] applies. [step 2.2, step 3.1, L6]

5.1 $(f^{(n)})$ converges to $L$ in $K$. Let $\varepsilon > 0$ in $K$. By [L3] — this is the countable-cofinality step, and it is the only place where anything special about $K$ is used — there is $k \in \mathbb{N}$ with $t^{-k} < \varepsilon$. Put $N := N_k$. For every $n \ge N$, [step 4.1] and [L2] give $(f^{(n)} - L)(j) = f^{(n)}(j) - L(j) = 0$ for every $j \le k$, so $|f^{(n)} - L| < t^{-k}$ by [L3] and therefore $|f^{(n)} - L| < \varepsilon$ by transitivity [L2]. As $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary, this is convergence in the sense of [L4]. [step 3.2, step 4.1, L2, L3, L4]

6.1 The sequence $(f^{(n)})$ was an arbitrary Cauchy sequence in $K$, and [step 3.2] and [step 5.1] produce an element $L \in K$ to which it converges; so every Cauchy sequence in $K$ converges in $K$. [step 3.2, step 5.1, discharge-construct] ∎

## Remarks

- **What makes the argument work, in one sentence.** The value group of $K$ is $\mathbb{Z}$, whose cofinality is countable, so the continuum of thresholds $\varepsilon > 0$ in the Cauchy condition collapses to the countable family $t^{-k}$, $k \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[lem-laurent-non-archimedean]], clause 3), and a sequence indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ can meet all of them. A proof that skipped this step would be proving nothing: it is exactly the point at which the countability of the index set $\mathbb{N}$ is matched to the structure of the field.

- **Support-boundedness of the limit is a separate obligation, and it is discharged from a single threshold.** Knowing that each coefficient $f^{(n)}(j)$ is eventually constant gives a function $\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R}$ and nothing more; there is no reason *a priori* why its support should be bounded below. What supplies that is [step 3.2]: the threshold $k = 0$ freezes *all* indices $j \le 0$ simultaneously from the single stage $N_0$ onward, so $L$ agrees with the one series $f^{(N_0)}$ on the whole negative half-line and inherits its lower bound.

- **No choice is used.** The stage $N_k$ is not chosen: it is defined as the least element of $M_k$, which exists by the well-ordering principle ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]). This matters because the construction makes countably many selections, and a version of it that said "pick some $N_k$" would be an appeal to countable choice for no reason.

- **This is Cauchy completeness and nothing more.** $K$ is sequentially Cauchy complete and at the same time lacks the least-upper-bound property ([[cor-laurent-not-lub-complete]]); the two are not the same condition, and in a non-Archimedean field they come apart. Nor does this theorem give the unrestricted nested interval property: see [[cor-laurent-nested-intervals]] for what it does give, and [[cex-laurent-nested-intervals-empty]] for what it does not.

## Statement

Let $K = \mathbb{R}((t^{-1}))$ and let
$P = \{\, f \in K : f \ne 0_K \text{ and } \operatorname{lc}(f) > 0 \,\}$
([[def-formal-laurent-series]]). Then:

1. $P$ is a positive cone on $K$, so $(K, P)$ is an ordered field
   ([[def-ordered-field]]), and $f < g$ holds exactly when $g - f \ne 0_K$ and
   $\operatorname{lc}(g - f) > 0$.
2. For $f \ne 0_K$ the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]) satisfies
   $|f| \ne 0_K$, $v(|f|) = v(f)$ and
   $\operatorname{lc}(|f|) = \lvert \operatorname{lc}(f) \rvert > 0$.
3. The map $\iota : \mathbb{R} \to K$ sending $c$ to the series with value $c$
   at index $0$ is an injective ring homomorphism with $\iota(c) \in P$ exactly
   when $c > 0$; and the canonical naturals of $K$ are
   $n \cdot 1_K = \iota(n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}})$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $K$ with its valuation $v$, leading coefficient $\operatorname{lc}$, constants $\iota(c)$ and the set $P$ above.

[L1] For nonzero $h \in K$, $h(k) = 0$ for $k < v(h)$ and $h(v(h)) = \operatorname{lc}(h) \ne 0$; $\iota(c)$ is $c$ at index $0$ and $0$ elsewhere; $1_K = \iota(1)$ ([[def-formal-laurent-series]]).

[L2] $K$ is a commutative ring, $(f+g)(k) = f(k)+g(k)$, and $(\iota(c)h)(k) = c\,h(k)$ ([[lem-laurent-series-ring]]).

[L3] For nonzero $f, g \in K$: $fg \ne 0_K$ with $\operatorname{lc}(fg) = \operatorname{lc}(f)\operatorname{lc}(g)$; $-f \ne 0_K$ with $v(-f) = v(f)$ and $\operatorname{lc}(-f) = -\operatorname{lc}(f)$; if $v(f) < v(g)$ then $f+g \ne 0_K$ with $v(f+g) = v(f)$ and $\operatorname{lc}(f+g) = \operatorname{lc}(f)$; and if $v(f) = v(g)$ with $\operatorname{lc}(f) + \operatorname{lc}(g) \ne 0$ then $f+g \ne 0_K$ with $\operatorname{lc}(f+g) = \operatorname{lc}(f) + \operatorname{lc}(g)$ ([[lem-laurent-valuation]]).

[L4] $K$ is a field ([[thm-laurent-series-field]], [[def-field]]).

[L5] An ordered field is a field with a subset $P$ satisfying (O1) trichotomy, for each $x$ exactly one of $x \in P$, $x = 0$, $-x \in P$, and (O2) closure of $P$ under addition and multiplication; the order is then $a < b :\iff b - a \in P$ ([[def-ordered-field]]). For $n \ge 1$, $n \cdot 1_F$ is the $n$-fold sum of $1_F$, and $0 \cdot 1_F = 0$ ([[def-archimedean-field]]).

[L6] $\mathbb{R}$ is an ordered field: exactly one of $x > 0$, $x = 0$, $x < 0$ holds for each real $x$, and sums and products of positive reals are positive ([[thm-reals-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L7] $|x| = x$ when $x \ge 0$ and $|x| = -x$ when $x < 0$, in any ordered field and in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-abs-value]]).

[L8] Induction: a property holding at $0$ and inherited from $n$ to $n+1$ holds at every natural number ([[thm-induction-principle]], [[def-natural-numbers]]).

[L9] The order on $\mathbb{Z}$ is total, so for $p, q \in \mathbb{Z}$ exactly one of $p < q$, $p = q$, $q < p$ holds ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $f \in K$. If $f = 0_K$ then neither $f$ nor $-f = 0_K$ lies in $P$, since membership in $P$ requires being nonzero. If $f \ne 0_K$ then $-f \ne 0_K$ and $\operatorname{lc}(-f) = -\operatorname{lc}(f)$ by [L3], and by trichotomy in $\mathbb{R}$ ([L6]) exactly one of $\operatorname{lc}(f) > 0$ and $-\operatorname{lc}(f) > 0$ holds. So for every $f$ exactly one of $f \in P$, $f = 0_K$, $-f \in P$ holds, which is (O1). [L1, L3, L5, L6]

1.2 Let $f, g \in P$. By [L3] $fg \ne 0_K$ and $\operatorname{lc}(fg) = \operatorname{lc}(f)\operatorname{lc}(g)$, a product of two positive reals, hence positive by [L6]; so $fg \in P$. [L3, L6]

1.3 $\iota(c) + \iota(d) = \iota(c+d)$ because addition is computed index by index, and $\iota(c)\iota(d) = \iota(cd)$ because $(\iota(c)\iota(d))(k) = c\,\iota(d)(k)$ by [L2], which is $cd$ at $k = 0$ and $0$ elsewhere; also $\iota(1) = 1_K$, and $\iota$ is injective since $\iota(c)(0) = c$. [L1, L2]

2.1 Let $f, g \in P$ and compare $v(f)$ with $v(g)$, which by [L9] are related in exactly one of three ways. If $v(f) < v(g)$ then by [L3] $f + g \ne 0_K$ and $\operatorname{lc}(f+g) = \operatorname{lc}(f) > 0$; if $v(g) < v(f)$ the same argument with the roles exchanged applies; and if $v(f) = v(g)$ then $\operatorname{lc}(f) + \operatorname{lc}(g) > 0$ by [L6], in particular nonzero, so by [L3] $f+g \ne 0_K$ and $\operatorname{lc}(f+g) = \operatorname{lc}(f) + \operatorname{lc}(g) > 0$. In every case $f + g \in P$, which with [step 1.2] is (O2). [step 1.2, L3, L6, L9]

2.2 For $c \ne 0$ the series $\iota(c)$ is nonzero with $v(\iota(c)) = 0$ and $\operatorname{lc}(\iota(c)) = c$, so $\iota(c) \in P$ exactly when $c > 0$; and $\iota(0) = 0_K \notin P$. With [step 1.3] this makes $\iota$ an injective ring homomorphism carrying the positive reals onto the positive constants. [step 1.3, L1]

2.3 For every natural $n$, $n \cdot 1_K = \iota(n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}})$: at $n = 0$ both sides are $0_K$ by [L5] and [L1], and if the identity holds at $n$ then $(n+1)\cdot 1_K = n \cdot 1_K + 1_K = \iota(n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}) + \iota(1) = \iota(n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} + 1) = \iota((n+1)\cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}})$ by [step 1.3]. [step 1.3, L1, L5, L8]

3.1 By [step 1.1] and [step 2.1] the set $P$ satisfies (O1) and (O2), and $K$ is a field by [L4]; hence $(K,P)$ is an ordered field, in which $f < g$ means $g - f \in P$, that is, $g - f \ne 0_K$ and $\operatorname{lc}(g-f) > 0$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L4, L5]

4.1 Let $f \ne 0_K$. If $f \in P$ then $f > 0_K$ by [step 3.1], so $|f| = f$ by [L7], and $\operatorname{lc}(|f|) = \operatorname{lc}(f) = \lvert \operatorname{lc}(f)\rvert$ since $\operatorname{lc}(f) > 0$. Otherwise $-f \in P$ by [step 1.1], so $f < 0_K$ and $|f| = -f$, whence $|f| \ne 0_K$, $v(|f|) = v(f)$ and $\operatorname{lc}(|f|) = -\operatorname{lc}(f) = \lvert\operatorname{lc}(f)\rvert$, again positive. In both cases $v(|f|) = v(f)$ and $\operatorname{lc}(|f|) = \lvert\operatorname{lc}(f)\rvert > 0$. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L3, L7]

5.1 Clause 1 is [step 3.1], clause 2 is [step 4.1], and clause 3 is [step 2.2] with [step 2.3]. [step 3.1, step 2.2, step 4.1, step 2.3] ∎

## Remarks

- **The order compares lowest terms, and only those.** By clause 1, deciding $f < g$ means finding the least index at which $f$ and $g$ differ and comparing the two coefficients there. Every later coefficient is irrelevant, which is why $\iota(c) > t^{-1}$ for every positive real $c$, however small, and why the order is not the coefficientwise one.

- **$\mathbb{R}$ sits inside $K$ as an ordered subfield, and that is all clause 3 says.** It does not say that $\mathbb{R}$ is cofinal in $K$, and indeed it is not: the computation used for the canonical naturals in [[lem-laurent-non-archimedean]] applies verbatim to every constant, since $v(t) = -1 < 0 = v(\iota(c))$ for every $c \ne 0$, so $\iota(c) < t$ for every real $c$. The identification $n \cdot 1_K = \iota(n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}})$ is recorded because the Archimedean property is a statement about the canonical naturals ([[def-archimedean-field]]), and it is the bridge between those and the constant series.
