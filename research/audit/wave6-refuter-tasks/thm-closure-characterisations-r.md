## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with closure $\overline{A}$ as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]] and derived set $A'$ as in
[[def-limit-point-r]]. Write

$$E \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing \text{ for every real } \varepsilon > 0 \,\}$$

for the set of adherent points of $A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). Then:

1. $\overline{A} = E$.
2. $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$.
3. $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed superset of $A$: it is closed, it
   contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed $F$ with $A \subseteq F$.
4. $A$ is closed if and only if $A = \overline{A}$, if and only if
   $A' \subseteq A$.

Claim 3 is the content of the definition of $\overline{A}$ and is restated here
so that the four descriptions stand together; claims 1, 2 and 4 are the ones
that carry work.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, and the set $E$ of adherent points of $A$ as displayed in the Statement.

[L1] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; $F$ is closed when $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L2] $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$; $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) = N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$; and if $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ then $\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ and $N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] $\overline{A}$ is the intersection of the nonempty family of closed supersets of $A$; it is closed, it contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed superset of $A$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]).

[L4] $x$ is an adherent point of $A$ when every $N_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $A$, a limit point when every $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $A$, and $A'$ is the set of limit points ([[def-limit-point-r]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $A \subseteq E$: for $x \in A$ and any $\varepsilon > 0$ one has $x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$, so that intersection is nonempty. [L2, L4]

1.2 Let $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus E$; by the definition of $E$ there is a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$. [L4, choose]

1.3 Let $F$ be closed with $A \subseteq F$, and let $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus F$; since $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open there is a real $\eta > 0$ with $N_\eta(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus F$. [L1, choose]

2.1 For every $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ the radius $\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x|$ is positive and $N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, so $N_\delta(y) \cap A = \varnothing$ and $y \notin E$; hence $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$, and since $x$ was an arbitrary point of $\mathbb{R} \setminus E$ that set is open, that is, $E$ is closed. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L4]

2.2 From $N_\eta(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus F \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus A$ we get $N_\eta(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, so $x \notin E$; hence $\mathbb{R} \setminus F \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$, that is, $E \subseteq F$, for every closed $F \supseteq A$. [step 1.3, L4]

3.1 By steps 1.1 and 2.1 the set $E$ is a closed superset of $A$, so $\overline{A} \subseteq E$ by the leastness in [L3]; and $\overline{A}$ is itself a closed superset of $A$ by [L3], so step 2.2 applied to $F = \overline{A}$ gives $E \subseteq \overline{A}$. Hence $\overline{A} = E$, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, L3]

4.1 $E = A \cup A'$: if $x \in E$ and $x \notin A$ then for every $\varepsilon > 0$ some $a \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ exists, and $a \ne x$ because $x \notin A$, so $a \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ and $x \in A'$; conversely $A \subseteq E$ by step 1.1, and $A' \subseteq E$ because $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$. Combining with step 3.1 gives $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$, which is claim 2. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L2, L4]

5.1 Claim 4: if $A$ is closed then $A$ is a closed superset of itself, so $\overline{A} \subseteq A$ by [L3], while $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ by [L3], whence $A = \overline{A}$; conversely if $A = \overline{A}$ then $A$ is closed because $\overline{A}$ is. Finally $A = \overline{A}$ says $A = A \cup A'$ by step 4.1, and $A = A \cup A'$ holds exactly when $A' \subseteq A$. [step 4.1, L3]

6.1 Claim 3 is [L3] restated, and claims 1, 2 and 4 are steps 3.1, 4.1 and 5.1, so all four hold. [step 3.1, step 4.1, step 5.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Which claim does the work in practice.** Claim 1 is the one used almost
  everywhere below: to show a point lies in $\overline{A}$ one exhibits, for each
  $\varepsilon > 0$, a point of $A$ within $\varepsilon$ of it. Claim 2 is what
  separates the two ways a point can be adherent, by membership or by
  accumulation, and it is what makes the notion of an isolated point visible.

- **No special property of $\mathbb{R}$ is used.** The argument uses the
  definitions of open, closed, neighbourhood and closure, and the order enters
  only through the nesting property of neighbourhoods; neither the
  least-upper-bound property nor the Archimedean property appears at any step.
  The results of this page that do use them are flagged in
  [[rem-r-native-topology-scope]].

- **The sequential form is a separate theorem and costs more.** Replacing
  "every neighbourhood meets $A$" by "some sequence in $A$ converges to $x$" is
  [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]], and the passage from the
  first to the second spends the axiom of countable choice, since it selects one
  point of $A$ from each of infinitely many neighbourhoods. The characterisation
  proved above is choice free.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with open and closed sets as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

- The **interior** of $A$ is the union of all open subsets of $A$:
  $$A^{\circ} \;:=\; \bigcup \{\, U \subseteq \mathbb{R} : U \text{ open and } U \subseteq A \,\}.$$
- The **closure** of $A$ is the intersection of all closed supersets of $A$:
  $$\overline{A} \;:=\; \bigcap \{\, F \subseteq \mathbb{R} : F \text{ closed and } A \subseteq F \,\}.$$
- The **boundary** of $A$ is $\partial A := \overline{A} \setminus A^{\circ}$.
- The **exterior** of $A$ is $\operatorname{ext} A := (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)^{\circ}$.

**Both operators are well defined and deliver what their names claim.** The
family whose union defines $A^{\circ}$ always contains $\varnothing$, and the
family whose intersection defines $\overline{A}$ always contains $\mathbb{R}$,
so the second family is nonempty and both expressions denote subsets of
$\mathbb{R}$ without appeal to any convention about empty unions or
intersections. Moreover:

- $A^{\circ}$ is **open**, being a union of open sets
  ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], claim 1), and $A^{\circ} \subseteq A$, since
  every set in the family is a subset of $A$. It is therefore the **largest**
  open subset of $A$: any open $U \subseteq A$ is a member of the family and so
  $U \subseteq A^{\circ}$.
- $\overline{A}$ is **closed**, being an intersection of a nonempty family of
  closed sets ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], claim 3), and $A \subseteq
  \overline{A}$, since every set in the family contains $A$. It is therefore the
  **smallest** closed superset of $A$: any closed $F \supseteq A$ is a member of
  the family and so $\overline{A} \subseteq F$.

**Pointwise description of the interior.** For $x \in \mathbb{R}$,

$$x \in A^{\circ} \iff \text{there is } \varepsilon > 0 \text{ with } N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A .$$

If $x \in A^{\circ}$ then, $A^{\circ}$ being open and containing $x$, there is
$\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A^{\circ} \subseteq A$.
Conversely if $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A$ then $N_\varepsilon(x)$ is an open
subset of $A$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) containing $x$, hence
$x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A^{\circ}$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

The corresponding pointwise description of the closure is not a definitional
matter and is proved separately, as [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

## Remarks

- **The four sets partition nothing by themselves, but three of them do.** For
  every $A$ the three sets $A^{\circ}$, $\partial A$ and $\operatorname{ext} A$
  are pairwise disjoint with union $\mathbb{R}$. This is not proved here and is
  not used on this page; what is used is only the definitions above and the
  characterisations of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

- **Interior and closure are dual.** Complementation exchanges the two families
  above, since $U$ is open exactly when $\mathbb{R} \setminus U$ is closed, so
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus A^{\circ} = \overline{\mathbb{R} \setminus A}$ and
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A} = (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)^{\circ} =
  \operatorname{ext} A$. The second identity is the reason the exterior is
  usually described as "the complement of the closure".

- **$A$ is open exactly when $A = A^{\circ}$, and closed exactly when
  $A = \overline{A}$.** For the first: $A^{\circ} \subseteq A$ always, and
  $A \subseteq A^{\circ}$ holds exactly when $A$ is one of the open subsets of
  $A$, that is, exactly when $A$ is open. The closure half is the same argument
  read the other way, and it is recorded as a claim of
  [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] because the rest of that theorem needs it.

- **Boundary points may or may not belong to the set.** $\partial (0,1) =
  \partial [0,1] = \{0,1\}$, and the two boundary points lie outside the first
  set and inside the second; the boundary sees only the way the set meets its
  complement, not which side the edge is assigned to.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]] and closure as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]].

- $x$ is an **adherent point** of $A$ when $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne
  \varnothing$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$.
- $x$ is a **limit point** (or *accumulation point*) of $A$ when
  $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every real
  $\varepsilon > 0$: every punctured neighbourhood of $x$ meets $A$.
- $x$ is an **isolated point** of $A$ when $x \in A$ and there is a real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$.
- The **derived set** of $A$ is
  $$A' \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \text{ is a limit point of } A \,\}.$$
- $A$ is **dense in $\mathbb{R}$** when $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$.

**A limit point is an adherent point**, since $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq
N_\varepsilon(x)$; and an element of $A$ is an adherent point of $A$, since
$x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). So the adherent
points of $A$ are exactly the points of $A \cup A'$, a statement proved as part
of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

**Limit point and isolated point are exact opposites inside $A$.** For
$x \in A$: $x$ is an isolated point of $A$ exactly when it is not a limit point
of $A$. Indeed $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$ says precisely that
$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, because $x$ itself always lies in
$N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ when $x \in A$; so the existence of an $\varepsilon$
witnessing isolation is the negation of the condition defining a limit point.
A point of $A$ is therefore either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$, and
never both.

**A limit point need not belong to the set, and a point of the set need not be a
limit point.** Both possibilities occur, and the two examples that matter later
are $0$, which is a limit point of $\{\, 1/k : k \ge 1 \,\}$ without belonging
to it, and $0$ again, which belongs to $\{0\} \cup [1,2]$ as an isolated point.

## Remarks

- **Terminology: *limit point* here is about a set, never about a sequence.**
  This library reserves *subsequential limit* for the sequential notion
  ([[def-subsequential-limit]]), and the two are genuinely different: the
  constant sequence $x_k = 0$ has $0$ as a subsequential limit, while its set of
  values $\{0\}$ has no limit point at all. The distinction is the one
  [[def-subsequential-limit]] records under "Terminology", and it is respected
  throughout this page.

- **Density is defined through the closure, not through intervals.** Saying
  $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$ is equivalent to saying that every nonempty open
  subset of $\mathbb{R}$ meets $A$, and also to saying that every neighbourhood
  of every real meets $A$; the equivalences follow from
  [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] and are used in that form in
  [[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]].

- **The derived set need not be comparable with the set.** It can be strictly
  larger, as for $\mathbb{Q}$: every punctured neighbourhood of any real
  contains a rational, since density supplies one strictly between $x$ and
  $x + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]), so the derived set of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is all of $\mathbb{R}$. It can be strictly smaller, as for
  $\{0\}$, whose derived set is empty; and it can be neither, as for
  $\{0\} \cup (1,2)$, whose derived set is $[1,2]$, a set containing points
  outside the original and omitting the point $0$ of it. A closed set satisfying
  $A \subseteq A'$ is called perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]).

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]) and its absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]).

Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ with
$\varepsilon > 0$. The **$\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\},$$

and the **punctured $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \;=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}.$$

The two descriptions of $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ agree because $|y - x| = 0$ holds
exactly when $y = x$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**A neighbourhood is an open interval.** For every $x$ and every
$\varepsilon > 0$,

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;=\; (x - \varepsilon,\ x + \varepsilon),$$

the interval of [[def-interval]]. Indeed [[lem-of-abs-value]] gives, for
$\varepsilon > 0$, the equivalence $|y - x| < \varepsilon \iff -\varepsilon <
y - x < \varepsilon$, and adding $x$ throughout turns the right-hand side into
$x - \varepsilon < y < x + \varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**The centre lies in its own neighbourhoods.** $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, since
$|x - x| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**Punctured neighbourhoods are never empty.** The element
$y := x + \varepsilon/2$ satisfies $|y - x| = \varepsilon/2$, which is
$> 0$ and $< \varepsilon$, so $y \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$
([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

**Monotonicity in the radius.** If $0 < \delta \le \varepsilon$ then
$N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, because $|y - x| < \delta \le
\varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**Nesting at an interior point.** If $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and
$0 < \delta \le \varepsilon - |y - x|$, then

$$N_\delta(y) \;\subseteq\; N_\varepsilon(x).$$

Indeed for $z \in N_\delta(y)$ the triangle inequality
([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]) gives
$|z - x| = |(z - y) + (y - x)| \le |z - y| + |y - x| < \delta + |y - x| \le
\varepsilon$. Note that $\varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ precisely because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, so such a $\delta$ always exists.

## Remarks

- **The radius is a real number, not a rational.** Nothing on this page tests a
  condition against rational radii only. That convention belongs to
  [[def-real-limit]], where the quantifier is over rational $\varepsilon$ and
  the passage between the rational and the real form is the sanctioned remark of
  [[def-sequence]]. Here $\varepsilon$ ranges over the positive reals
  throughout, and every statement above is proved for an arbitrary positive
  real.

- **Why the punctured version is separated out.** A limit point of a set is a
  point every punctured neighbourhood of which meets the set
  ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and deleting the centre is exactly what stops a point
  of the set from qualifying automatically. The unpunctured condition defines
  the weaker notion of an adherent point, and the difference between the two is
  precisely an isolated point.

- **Nesting is the workhorse.** Almost every openness verification on this page
  has the shape "given $y$ in the set, shrink the radius by the distance
  already travelled", which is the nesting property above. It is recorded here
  once so that no later proof has to redo the triangle inequality in passing.

## Definition

Let $U, F \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]].

- $U$ is **open** when for every $x \in U$ there is a real $\varepsilon > 0$
  with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$.
- $F$ is **closed** when its complement $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open.
- A set is **clopen** when it is both open and closed.

The whole of the topology of $\mathbb{R}$ developed on this page rests on this
one definition: closedness is *defined* as openness of the complement, and every
other description of a closed set on this page is a theorem
([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]]).

**$\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen.** The condition defining openness
quantifies over the elements of the set, so it holds vacuously for
$\varnothing$; and for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ one has $N_1(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$,
so $\mathbb{R}$ is open. Since each of the two is the complement of the other,
each is also closed.

**Every neighbourhood is open.** Let $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and put
$\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x|$, which is $> 0$ because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$. The nesting property of [[def-neighbourhood-r]] gives
$N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$. So every point of $N_\varepsilon(x)$
has a neighbourhood inside it.

**The four open forms of [[def-interval]] are open sets.** Let $a, b \in
\mathbb{R}$.

- $(a,b)$: for $x$ with $a < x < b$, both $x - a > 0$ and $b - x > 0$, so
  $\delta := \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ is a positive real (the minimum of a
  two-element set of reals exists, [[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).
  If $|y - x| < \delta$ then $y > x - \delta \ge x - (x - a) = a$ and
  $y < x + \delta \le x + (b - x) = b$, so $y \in (a,b)$; hence
  $N_\delta(x) \subseteq (a,b)$.
- $(a,\infty)$: for $x > a$ take $\delta := x - a > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y > x - \delta = a$.
- $(-\infty,b)$: for $x < b$ take $\delta := b - x > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y < x + \delta = b$.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: already treated above.

**The four closed forms of [[def-interval]] are closed sets.** In each case the
complement is shown open directly.

- $[a,b]$: if $x \notin [a,b]$ then $x < a$ or $x > b$ by trichotomy
  ([[def-ordered-field]]). If $x < a$, take $\delta := a - x > 0$; every
  $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has $y < x + \delta = a$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. If
  $x > b$, take $\delta := x - b > 0$; every $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has
  $y > x - \delta = b$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. So
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus [a,b]$ is open.
- $[a,\infty)$: its complement is $(-\infty,a)$, which is open by the previous
  paragraph.
- $(-\infty,b]$: its complement is $(b,\infty)$, which is open.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: its complement is $\varnothing$, which is
  open.

## Remarks

- **Open and closed are not opposites, and not exhaustive.** A set may be
  neither: the half-open interval $[0,1)$ is neither open nor closed
  ([[fs-every-set-is-open-or-closed]]). A set may be both: $\varnothing$ and
  $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen. The words are inherited from the interval terminology
  of [[def-interval]], and the agreement between the two usages is exactly the
  two lists verified above: an interval called open there is an open set here,
  and an interval called closed there is a closed set here.

- **A clopen set is a disconnection waiting to happen.** If $A$ is clopen and
  both $A$ and $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ are nonempty, then each of the two is
  its own closure, so the two are separated in the sense of
  [[def-connected-r]] and $\mathbb{R} = A \cup (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)$ is a
  disconnection. Since $\mathbb{R}$ is order-convex it is connected
  ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]]), so no such $A$ exists:
  $\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are the only clopen subsets of $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The half-open forms are the ones the two lists omit**, and deliberately so:
  $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ with $a < b$ are neither open nor closed as subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The radius depends on the point.** Openness asks for *some* $\varepsilon$
  at each point, and that $\varepsilon$ may shrink to nothing as the point
  approaches the edge of the set, as the computation for $(a,b)$ shows: there
  $\delta = \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ tends to $0$ as $x$ tends to either endpoint.
  Asking instead for a single $\varepsilon$ that works simultaneously at every
  point of the set is a strictly stronger condition, and it is not what is
  defined here; nothing on this page uses it.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}$, with closure as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]] and sequences and convergence as in
[[def-sequence]] and [[def-real-limit]]. Then

$$x \in \overline{A} \iff \text{there is a sequence } (a_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \text{ with } a_k \in A \text{ for every } k \text{ and } a_k \to x .$$

Consequently $A$ is closed if and only if it is **sequentially closed**: whenever
a sequence with all its terms in $A$ converges, its limit lies in $A$.

**The right-to-left direction is choice free; the left-to-right direction spends
$\mathrm{AC}_\omega$** ([[def-countable-choice]]). Producing a sequence from a
point of the closure requires selecting one point of $A$ from each of the
countably many sets $N_{1/(k+1)}(x) \cap A$, and this library has no canonical
rule for that selection, so the axiom of countable choice is invoked
explicitly at step 2.2 and nowhere else.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a real $x$. Sequences are functions on $\mathbb{N}$, which contains $0$, so a sequence is $(a_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ and the radii used below are $1/(k+1)$ rather than $1/k$ ([[def-sequence]]).

[L1] $\overline{A}$ is exactly the set of adherent points of $A$, that is, of points every neighbourhood of which meets $A$; and $A$ is closed exactly when $A = \overline{A}$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L2] $N_\varepsilon(x) = \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}$ for real $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L3] $(a_k) \to x$ means: for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|a_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$ ([[def-real-limit]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L4] Strictly between any two reals lies a rational; in particular for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a rational $q$ with $0 < q < \varepsilon$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L5] Reciprocal Archimedean property: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]]).

[L6] Canonical naturals: $n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ and $m \le n$ in $\mathbb{N}$ gives $m \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} \le n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]); a positive element has a positive inverse and $0 < a \le b$ gives $0 < 1/b \le 1/a$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

[L7] Countable choice: for every family $(X_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of nonempty sets there is a function $f$ with domain $\mathbb{N}$ such that $f(k) \in X_k$ for every $k$ ([[def-countable-choice]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For the right-to-left implication, assume $a_k \in A$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and $a_k \to x$, and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real. [assume-hyp, L3]

1.2 For the left-to-right implication, assume $x \in \overline{A}$; then for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ the radius $1/(k+1)$ is a positive real and the set $X_k := N_{1/(k+1)}(x) \cap A$ is nonempty, because $x$ is an adherent point of $A$ by [L1]. [assume-hyp, L1, L2, L6]

2.1 Fix a rational $q$ with $0 < q < \varepsilon$ by [L4], and then $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|a_k - x| < q$ for all $k \ge K$ by [L3]; in particular $|a_K - x| < q < \varepsilon$, so $a_K \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ and that intersection is nonempty. As $\varepsilon$ was an arbitrary positive real, $x$ is an adherent point of $A$, hence $x \in \overline{A}$ by [L1]. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L3, L4, choose]

2.2 Apply [L7] to the family $(X_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of step 1.2 and fix $f$ with $f(k) \in X_k$ for every $k$; putting $a_k := f(k)$ gives a sequence with $a_k \in A$ and $|a_k - x| < 1/(k+1)$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 1.2, L2, L7, choose]

3.1 That sequence converges to $x$: let $\varepsilon > 0$ be rational, fix by [L5] a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$, and put $K := n - 1$, a natural number since $n \ge 1$; for every $k \ge K$ one has $k + 1 \ge n \ge 1$, hence $0 < 1/(k+1) \le 1/n < \varepsilon$ by [L6], and therefore $|a_k - x| < 1/(k+1) < \varepsilon$. [step 2.2, L3, L5, L6, choose]

4.1 Step 2.1 gives the implication from right to left and steps 2.2 and 3.1 give it from left to right, so $x \in \overline{A}$ holds exactly when some sequence with all terms in $A$ converges to $x$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1]

4.2 Sequential closedness: if $A$ is closed and a sequence with all terms in $A$ converges to some $y$, then $y \in \overline{A}$ by step 2.1 and $\overline{A} = A$ by [L1], so $y \in A$; conversely, if every convergent sequence with terms in $A$ has its limit in $A$, then any $y \in \overline{A}$ is the limit of the sequence produced by steps 2.2 and 3.1, hence lies in $A$, so $\overline{A} \subseteq A$, and with $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ this gives $A = \overline{A}$, that is, $A$ is closed. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, L1]

5.1 Both assertions of the statement are proved, namely the sequential description of the closure in step 4.1 and the equivalence of closedness with sequential closedness in step 4.2. [step 4.1, step 4.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the choice is spent, and why it cannot be avoided here.** Step 2.2 is
  the only appeal to [[def-countable-choice]]. A canonical selection would
  require a rule picking a distinguished element of an arbitrary nonempty subset
  of $\mathbb{R}$, and $\mathbb{R}$ carries no well-ordering that this library
  has constructed, so this library has no such rule to offer. Contrast
  [[lem-subset-of-countable]] and [[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]], where
  the selection is from subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ and the least element is
  canonical.

- **The choice is genuinely confined to one direction.** Step 2.1 selects a
  single rational $q$ and a single index $K$ for one $\varepsilon$ at a time, and
  finitely many selections need no choice principle. So "the limit of a
  convergent sequence in a closed set lies in the set" is a theorem of ZF, and
  only the production of a sequence out of a point of the closure is not.

- **The indices start at $0$.** Since $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
  ([[def-sequence]]), the shrinking radii are $1/(k+1)$ and not $1/k$; the
  latter is undefined at $k = 0$. The threshold in step 3.1 is $K = n - 1$ for
  the same reason, and $n \ge 1$ is exactly what makes $K$ a natural number.

This page builds the topology of $\mathbb{R}$ out of the order and the absolute
value alone: a neighbourhood is an interval ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), and open
and closed are defined from neighbourhoods ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]). Some
of what follows uses nothing else about $\mathbb{R}$, and some of it is written
in order vocabulary from beginning to end. This remark separates the two, so a
reader knows which results are candidates for reuse elsewhere and which are not
even statable elsewhere. **It asserts nothing about topological spaces in
general: they are developed later in this library, on the page of
[[def-topological-space]] and [[def-metrizable-space]], where the metric
development becomes a special case, but no claim about them is made or needed
here and nothing below rests on them.**

**Results that use only the definitions.** [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]] and
[[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] use openness, closedness, closure and the
nesting property of neighbourhoods, together with the comparison of two positive
radii, and nothing beyond that. Neither the least-upper-bound property nor the
Archimedean property appears in either proof, and their statements mention no
interval, no bound and no order, so those statements would still make sense
wherever a notion of neighbourhood is available, however it arises.

**Results that cannot be separated from the order of $\mathbb{R}$.** Four
results on this page depend on the order. For the first three the order is in
what they say and not merely in how they are proved; for the fourth it is in the
proof only, and the bullet says so.

- [[thm-open-subsets-of-r-structure]] says that an open set is a countable
  disjoint union of **open intervals**. An interval is defined by the order
  ([[def-interval]]), the components are the classes of an equivalence relation
  defined by order-convexity, and the identification of a component as an
  interval is carried out with $\sup$ and $\inf$. Delete the order and there is
  no statement left to prove.
- [[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]] characterises connectedness by
  **order-convexity**. Connectedness itself is defined without the order
  ([[def-connected-r]]), but the property it is being equated with is an order
  property, so the theorem is a bridge between an order notion and a topological
  one and exists only where both are present.
- [[thm-heine-borel-r]] and [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]] speak of
  **closed bounded intervals** and of **bounded** sets. Boundedness is an order
  notion ([[def-bounded-set]]), and the proof of the first is a bisection, which
  uses the midpoint and hence the field operations as well. The completeness of
  $\mathbb{R}$ enters through [[thm-nested-interval-property]].
- [[thm-compact-iff-sequentially-compact-r]] routes **both** implications
  through the previous item, whose backward half spends the least-upper-bound
  property, and its **forward** implication additionally uses
  [[thm-bolzano-weierstrass]], which spends that property again; the backward
  implication does not use Bolzano-Weierstrass at all. Its statement mentions
  only compactness and sequences ([[def-open-cover-r]]), so unlike the three
  above it *is* statable without an order; the dependence lies entirely in the
  proof. This library provides no other proof, so nothing here licenses the
  equivalence outside $\mathbb{R}$.

**Where the dependence on completeness is visible rather than merely present.**
[[fs-closed-bounded-compact-without-completeness]] refutes, inside this library,
the claim that closed and bounded implies compact in an arbitrary ordered field,
and [[cex-closed-bounded-in-q-not-compact]] names the witness in $\mathbb{Q}$.
That is the sharpest statement this page makes about the limits of its own
results: the Heine-Borel characterisation is not a formal consequence of the
definitions, and it fails in the nearest ordered field that is not complete.

**The metric topology of $\mathbb{R}$ is the topology of this page.** This
library does develop metric spaces ([[def-metric-space]],
[[def-metric-topology]]), and $\mathbb{R}$ under $d(x,y) = |x-y|$ is one of them
([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]). The two resulting notions of *open subset
of $\mathbb{R}$* are not merely equivalent but literally the same condition, and
unfolding the definitions is the whole of the proof: claim 2 of that lemma gives
$B(x,r) = (x-r,\ x+r)$, which is exactly the neighbourhood $N_r(x)$ of
[[def-neighbourhood-r]], so "every point of $U$ admits a ball inside $U$" and
"every point of $U$ admits a neighbourhood inside $U$"
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) say the same thing word for word. This page still
proves everything from the order directly, so that nothing here rests on the
metric development; the identification is recorded so that a reader moving
between the two pages knows they are looking at one topology and not two.
Because the two collections of open sets are one collection, everything built
from them is one notion as well. The interior, closure and boundary of
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]] and of
[[def-metric-interior-closure-boundary]] are the same three sets, since each
side characterises them in both of the same two ways, pointwise by
neighbourhoods and by extremality among the open subsets and the closed
supersets ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]],
[[thm-metric-closure-characterisation]]); limit point, isolated point, adherent
point and dense are defined by literally the same condition on the two sides
([[def-limit-point-r]]), once $N_\varepsilon(x)$ and $B(x,\varepsilon)$ are
recognised as the same set; and
[[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]] is the case $X = \mathbb{R}$ of
[[thm-metric-sequential-closure]], spending the axiom of countable choice in the
same one of the two directions.

**Bounded means the same here as it does in the metric development, and that
agreement is not a topological fact.** [[def-bounded-set]] calls
$A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ bounded when it has both a lower and an upper bound,
while [[def-metric-bounded-diameter]] calls it bounded when it is empty or lies
inside some ball of $(\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$. The two conditions hold of
exactly the same subsets of $\mathbb{R}$. If $A \subseteq B(x_0,r) = (x_0 - r,\
x_0 + r)$ ([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]], claim 2, [[def-metric-ball]])
then $x_0 - r$ and $x_0 + r$ bound $A$ below and above; conversely, if
$\ell \le a \le u$ for every $a \in A$ and $A \ne \varnothing$, then $\ell \le u$
and $A \subseteq B(\ell,\ u - \ell + 1)$, the radius being at least $1$ and hence
positive; and an empty $A$ is bounded under both definitions, vacuously under the
first and by the explicit empty clause of the second. So the word **bounded** in
[[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]] may be read in either sense without
changing which sets the theorem names.

What may not be done is to read that theorem as a statement about the topology.
Boundedness is a property of the metric and not of the topology it induces
([[fs-boundedness-is-a-topological-property]]): the metric
$\rho(u,v) = \min\{|u-v|,\ 1\}$ induces exactly the open sets of this page, and
under it every subset of $\mathbb{R}$, including $\mathbb{R}$ itself, is
bounded. Since the open sets are unchanged, compactness ([[def-open-cover-r]])
is unchanged too, and $\mathbb{R}$ is not compact, being unbounded in the order
sense ([[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]]); yet $\mathbb{R}$ is closed,
and $\rho$-bounded. So "closed and bounded implies compact" is false for $\rho$
and true for $d_{\mathbb{R}}$, on one and the same topology. The identification
in the previous paragraph is with the usual metric specifically, and Heine-Borel
is a theorem about that metric and the order it comes from, not about the
topology alone.

**What is deliberately not claimed.** Whether the results above have analogues in
a setting carrying a topology with no order available at all, and whether
compactness and sequential compactness agree there, are questions about general
topological spaces. This library takes those questions up on a later page, where
[[def-metrizable-space]] identifies the metric development, this page's topology
included, as a special case of the general one; but nothing on **this** page
proves anything about general spaces, and the reader should take no assertion
about them from here. What is claimed here is narrower and
is checkable line by line against the proofs: in the four results listed above,
the order of $\mathbb{R}$ is used, and in three of them it is used in the
statement itself.

## Statement

Let open and closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ be as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

1. **Arbitrary unions of open sets are open.** If $\mathcal{U}$ is any family of
   open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, then $\bigcup \mathcal{U}$ is open.
2. **Finite intersections of open sets are open.** If $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
   $U_0, \dots, U_n$ are open, then $U_0 \cap \dots \cap U_n$ is open.
3. **Arbitrary intersections of closed sets are closed.** If $\mathcal{F}$ is a
   nonempty family of closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, then
   $\bigcap \mathcal{F}$ is closed.
4. **Finite unions of closed sets are closed.** If $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
   $F_0, \dots, F_n$ are closed, then $F_0 \cup \dots \cup F_n$ is closed.

The word *finite* in claims 2 and 4 is not decoration: an arbitrary
intersection of open sets need not be open, and dually an arbitrary union
of closed sets need not be closed; the remarks below say where that is settled.
Claim 3 asks $\mathcal{F}$ to be nonempty
only so that $\bigcap \mathcal{F}$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ without appeal to
a convention about the empty intersection.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A family $\mathcal{U}$ of open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, with $\bigcup \mathcal{U} = \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \in U \text{ for some } U \in \mathcal{U} \,\}$; a natural number $n$ and open sets $U_0, \dots, U_n$; a nonempty family $\mathcal{F}$ of closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, with $\bigcap \mathcal{F} = \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \in F \text{ for every } F \in \mathcal{F} \,\}$; and closed sets $F_0, \dots, F_n$.

[A1] De Morgan's laws in the ambient set theory: for a nonempty family $\mathcal{G}$ of subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{R} \setminus \bigcap \mathcal{G} = \bigcup \{\, \mathbb{R} \setminus G : G \in \mathcal{G} \,\}$, and $\mathbb{R} \setminus (G_0 \cup \dots \cup G_n) = (\mathbb{R} \setminus G_0) \cap \dots \cap (\mathbb{R} \setminus G_n)$. Also $\mathbb{R} \setminus (\mathbb{R} \setminus G) = G$.

[L1] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; $F$ is closed when $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L2] $N_\varepsilon(x) = \{\, y : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}$, and $0 < \delta \le \varepsilon$ gives $N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] Every nonempty finite set of reals has a minimum, so $\min\{\varepsilon, \eta\}$ is defined and equals one of the two entries, and is $\le$ both ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $x \in \bigcup \mathcal{U}$. Then $x \in U$ for some $U \in \mathcal{U}$, and $U$ is open, so there is $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{U}$; as $x$ was arbitrary, $\bigcup \mathcal{U}$ is open, which is claim 1. [given, L1, choose]

1.2 Now let $U$ and $V$ be open and let $x \in U \cap V$; fix $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$ and $\eta > 0$ with $N_\eta(x) \subseteq V$. [given, L1, choose]

2.1 Put $\delta := \min\{\varepsilon, \eta\}$, which is one of $\varepsilon, \eta$ and hence $> 0$, and satisfies $\delta \le \varepsilon$ and $\delta \le \eta$; then $N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$ and $N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\eta(x) \subseteq V$, so $N_\delta(x) \subseteq U \cap V$, and as $x$ was arbitrary $U \cap V$ is open. [step 1.2, L2, L3]

2.2 The family $\{\, \mathbb{R} \setminus F : F \in \mathcal{F} \,\}$ consists of open sets by [L1], so its union is open by step 1.1; that union is $\mathbb{R} \setminus \bigcap \mathcal{F}$ by [A1], so $\bigcap \mathcal{F}$ is closed, which is claim 3. [step 1.1, A1, L1]

3.1 Claim 2 now follows by induction on $n$: for $n = 0$ the intersection is $U_0$, which is open by hypothesis; and if $W := U_0 \cap \dots \cap U_n$ is open then $U_0 \cap \dots \cap U_{n+1} = W \cap U_{n+1}$ is an intersection of two open sets, hence open by step 2.1. [step 2.1, given]

4.1 Each $\mathbb{R} \setminus F_i$ is open by [L1], so $(\mathbb{R} \setminus F_0) \cap \dots \cap (\mathbb{R} \setminus F_n)$ is open by step 3.1; that set is $\mathbb{R} \setminus (F_0 \cup \dots \cup F_n)$ by [A1], so $F_0 \cup \dots \cup F_n$ is closed, which is claim 4. [step 3.1, A1, L1]

5.1 Claims 1, 2, 3 and 4 are steps 1.1, 3.1, 2.2 and 4.1 respectively, so arbitrary unions and finite intersections of open sets are open, and arbitrary intersections and finite unions of closed sets are closed. [step 1.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, step 4.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Completeness plays no part.** Nothing above uses the least-upper-bound
  property, or even the Archimedean property: the only facts about $\mathbb{R}$
  the proof touches are the definition of a neighbourhood, its monotonicity in
  the radius, and the comparison of two positive radii. What needs completeness
  is not the algebra of open sets but the theorems about compactness that come
  later.

- **Why finiteness cannot be dropped in claim 2.** The minimum taken in step 2.1
  is a minimum of finitely many positive radii, and it is positive precisely
  because it is one of them ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]). An infinite family of
  positive radii has an infimum that may be $0$, and then no positive $\delta$
  survives. That is exactly what happens for the shrinking intervals of
  [[fs-arbitrary-intersection-of-open-is-open]], whose named witness is
  [[cex-intersection-of-shrinking-intervals-not-open]].

- **The four claims are a rewriting of two.** Claims 3 and 4 are claims 1 and 2
  read through complementation, and closedness is *defined* by complementation
  ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), so no separate argument about closed sets is
  possible or needed.
