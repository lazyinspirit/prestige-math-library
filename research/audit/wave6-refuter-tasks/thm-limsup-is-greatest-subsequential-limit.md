## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]) and write
$\Lambda := \limsup_{k} x_k \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-limsup-liminf]]).
Then, with the extended subsequential limit set
$\overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$ of [[def-extended-limits]]:

1. $\Lambda \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$: there is a strictly increasing
   $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that $(x_{n_j})$ converges to $\Lambda$ in
   $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$;
2. $L \le \Lambda$ for every $L \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$.

So $\overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$ is **nonempty** and has a **greatest
element**, and that element is $\limsup_k x_k$. In particular every sequence of
reals whatever has a subsequence that converges in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$.

**The extended set is the right home for this statement, and the real set is
not.** The finite subsequential limit set $\operatorname{SL}(x)$ of
[[def-subsequential-limit]] may be empty, and when it is not it may have a
greatest element different from $\limsup_k x_k$; both failures are exhibited by
the dedicated counterexample on the companion page. What is true for
$\operatorname{SL}(x)$ follows: when $\Lambda$ is a real number, claim 1 puts it
in $\operatorname{SL}(x)$, since the two sets agree on $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-extended-limits]]), and claim 2 then makes it the greatest element there
too.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals, its tail ranges $T_n = \{x_k : k \ge n\}$, the extended tail suprema $s_n = \sup T_n$, and $\Lambda := \limsup_k x_k = \inf\{s_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ ([[def-limsup-liminf]]).

[L1] All of $s_n$ and $\Lambda$ exist in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, with $s_n$ the least upper bound of $T_n$ and $\Lambda$ the greatest lower bound of $\{s_n\}$ ([[lem-limsup-exists]], [[lem-extended-reals-complete]], [[def-upper-bound]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L2] The order on $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is total, so the failure of $a \le b$ is $b < a$; $-\infty$ is least and $+\infty$ greatest; every real is $< +\infty$ and $> -\infty$; and on $\mathbb{R}$ the order is that of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-extended-reals]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L3] Epsilon characterisation for a real $\Lambda$: for every real $\eta > 0$ one has $x_k < \Lambda + \eta$ eventually and $x_k > \Lambda - \eta$ frequently ([[lem-limsup-epsilon-characterisation]]).

[L4] Recursion theorem: for a set $A$, an element $a \in A$ and a function $f : A \to A$ there is a unique $g : \mathbb{N} \to A$ with $g_0 = a$ and $g_{j+1} = f(g_j)$ ([[thm-recursion]]).

[L5] Well-ordering principle: every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L6] Index maps: if $n_j < n_{j+1}$ for every $j$ then $n$ is strictly increasing, and then $n_j \ge j$ for every $j$; the composite $(x_{n_j})$ is a subsequence ([[lem-index-map-grows]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L7] Convergence in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ and the extended subsequential limit set ([[def-extended-limits]]); convergence to a real, for which it suffices to produce a threshold for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-real-limit]], [[def-sequence]]); divergence to $\pm\infty$ ([[def-divergence-to-infinity]]); and $|a - b| < c$ if and only if $b - c < a < b + c$ for $c > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L8] If $\limsup_k x_k = -\infty$ then $\liminf_k x_k = -\infty$ and $x_k \to -\infty$ ([[lem-liminf-le-limsup]], [[thm-convergence-iff-limsup-equals-liminf]]).

[L9] Limits preserve non-strict inequalities: if $y_j \le c$ for all large $j$ and $y_j \to y$ in $\mathbb{R}$, then $y \le c$ ([[lem-limit-preserves-order]]).

[L10] Archimedean facts: for every real $M$ there is a natural $p \ge 1$ with $M < p \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$, and for every real $\eta > 0$ a natural $m \ge 1$ with $1/m < \eta$; the canonical naturals satisfy $0 \le n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ and are increasing in $n$, and $0 < a \le b$ gives $0 < 1/b \le 1/a$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]], [[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

[L11] Strictly between any two reals lies a rational, hence a real ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L12] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total and transitive, so any two indices have a common upper bound ([[def-nat-order]], [[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 The element $\Lambda = \limsup_k x_k$ exists in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, and exactly one of the following holds: $\Lambda$ is a real number, $\Lambda = +\infty$, or $\Lambda = -\infty$. [given, L1, L2]

1.2 Suppose $\Lambda = +\infty$. Since $\Lambda$ is a lower bound of $\{s_n\}$, every $n$ has $+\infty \le s_n$ and so $s_n = +\infty$. Consequently, for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and every real $M$ there is $k \ge n$ with $x_k > M$: otherwise $M$ would be an upper bound of $T_n$ and leastness would give $s_n \le M$, contradicting $M < +\infty$. [given, L1, L2]

1.3 Suppose $\Lambda$ is real. Then for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and every real $\eta > 0$ there is $k \ge n$ with $|x_k - \Lambda| < \eta$: by [L3] fix $K$ with $x_k < \Lambda + \eta$ for all $k \ge K$, let $K'$ be an index at least as large as both $n$ and $K$, and use that $x_k > \Lambda - \eta$ frequently to obtain $k \ge K'$ with $x_k > \Lambda - \eta$; that $k$ satisfies $k \ge K$, hence also $x_k < \Lambda + \eta$, and $k \ge n$. [given, L3, L7, L12]

1.4 Suppose $\Lambda = -\infty$. Then $x_k \to -\infty$ by [L8], and the identity map $j \mapsto j$ is strictly increasing, so the subsequence $(x_j)$ of $(x_k)$ converges to $-\infty$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ and $\Lambda \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$. [given, L6, L7, L8]

1.5 Let $L \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$ be arbitrary and fix a strictly increasing $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that $(x_{n_j})$ converges to $L$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$; then $n_j \ge j$ for every $j$. [given, L6, L7]

2.1 In the case $\Lambda = +\infty$, define $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ by letting $f(n)$ be the least element of $E_n := \{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : k > n \text{ and } x_k > n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} \,\}$, which is nonempty by step 1.2 applied with the index $n+1$ and the real $M = n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$, and let $a$ be the least element of $\{\, k : x_k > 0 \,\}$, nonempty by step 1.2 with $n = 0$ and $M = 0$. Then $f(n) > n$ and $x_{f(n)} > n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ for every $n$. [step 1.2, L5, construct]

2.2 In the case $\Lambda$ real, define $g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ by letting $g(n)$ be the least element of $F_n := \{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : k > n \text{ and } |x_k - \Lambda| < 1/(n+1) \,\}$, which is nonempty by step 1.3 applied with the index $n+1$ and $\eta = 1/(n+1) > 0$, and let $b$ be the least element of $\{\, k : |x_k - \Lambda| < 1 \,\}$, nonempty by step 1.3 with $n = 0$ and $\eta = 1$. Then $g(n) > n$ and $|x_{g(n)} - \Lambda| < 1/(n+1)$ for every $n$. [step 1.3, L5, L10, construct]

2.3 If $L = -\infty$ then $L \le \Lambda$, since $-\infty$ is the least element of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$. [step 1.5, L2]

2.4 If $L = +\infty$, then for every real $M$ there is $J$ with $x_{n_j} > M$ for all $j \ge J$. Fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and a real $M$, and take $j$ at least as large as both $J$ and $n$; then $n_j \ge j \ge n$, so $x_{n_j} \in T_n$ and $M < x_{n_j} \le s_n$. As $M$ was an arbitrary real, $s_n$ is neither real nor $-\infty$, so $s_n = +\infty$; as $n$ was arbitrary, $\Lambda = \inf\{s_n\} = +\infty$ and $L \le \Lambda$. [step 1.5, L1, L2, L7, L12]

2.5 If $L$ is real, suppose for the sake of the comparison that $\Lambda < L$. By step 1.1 the element $\Lambda$ is then real or $-\infty$; choose a real $c$ with $\Lambda < c < L$, taking a rational strictly between $\Lambda$ and $L$ in the first case and $c := L - 1$ in the second. Since $\Lambda$ is the greatest lower bound of $\{s_n\}$ and $\Lambda < c$, the element $c$ is not a lower bound, so there is $n$ with $s_n < c$, and then $x_k \le s_n < c$ for every $k \ge n$. For $j \ge n$ we have $n_j \ge j \ge n$, hence $x_{n_j} \le c$, so $L \le c$ by [L9], contradicting $c < L$. By totality $L \le \Lambda$. [step 1.5, step 1.1, L1, L2, L9, L11]

3.1 In the case $\Lambda = +\infty$, the recursion theorem applied to $\mathbb{N}$, the element $a$ and the function $f$ gives $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ with $n_0 = a$ and $n_{j+1} = f(n_j)$. Then $n_j < n_{j+1}$ for every $j$, so $n$ is strictly increasing and $n_j \ge j$; and $x_{n_{j+1}} > n_j \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} \ge j \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ for every $j$. [step 2.1, L4, L6, L10]

3.2 In the case $\Lambda$ real, the recursion theorem applied to $\mathbb{N}$, the element $b$ and the function $g$ gives $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ with $n_0 = b$ and $n_{j+1} = g(n_j)$. Then $n$ is strictly increasing with $n_j \ge j$, and $|x_{n_{j+1}} - \Lambda| < 1/(n_j + 1) \le 1/(j+1)$ for every $j$. [step 2.2, L4, L6, L10]

4.1 In the case $\Lambda = +\infty$, the subsequence $(x_{n_j})$ diverges to $+\infty$: given a real $M$, take a natural $p \ge 1$ with $M < p \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$; every $j \ge p + 1$ satisfies $j - 1 \ge p$, so step 3.1 applied at $j - 1$ gives $x_{n_j} > (j-1) \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} \ge p \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} > M$. Hence $(x_{n_j})$ converges to $+\infty = \Lambda$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ and $\Lambda \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$. [step 3.1, L7, L10, L12]

4.2 In the case $\Lambda$ real, the subsequence $(x_{n_j})$ converges to $\Lambda$: given a real $\varepsilon > 0$, take a natural $m \ge 1$ with $1/m < \varepsilon$; every $j \ge m$ satisfies $j \ge 1$, so step 3.2 applied at $j - 1$ gives $|x_{n_j} - \Lambda| < 1/j \le 1/m < \varepsilon$. Producing such a threshold for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ establishes convergence, so $(x_{n_j})$ converges to $\Lambda$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ and $\Lambda \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$. [step 3.2, L7, L10]

5.1 The three cases of step 1.1 are exhaustive, and each produces a subsequence converging to $\Lambda$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$: step 4.1 when $\Lambda = +\infty$, step 4.2 when $\Lambda$ is real, and step 1.4 when $\Lambda = -\infty$. So $\Lambda \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$, which is claim 1. [step 4.1, step 4.2, step 1.4, L7]

6.1 Steps 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 cover the three possibilities for an arbitrary $L \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$ and give $L \le \Lambda$ in each, which is claim 2. With claim 1 this makes $\overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$ nonempty with greatest element $\Lambda = \limsup_k x_k$. [step 5.1, step 2.3, step 2.4, step 2.5, L2, discharge-construct] ∎

## Remarks

- **The construction uses no choice.** Both index maps are built by taking a
  *least* element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]) of an explicitly described
  nonempty set of naturals, so the functions $f$ and $g$ are defined outright and
  [[thm-recursion]] then produces the index map. This is the same device as in
  [[lem-peak-monotone-subsequence]], and for the same reason: a subsequence
  selected by repeated arbitrary choices would need a choice principle, and none
  is needed here.

- **Why the recursion threshold is indexed by the previous index rather than by
  the step number.** The recursion theorem produces a function of one variable, so
  the state carried from one step to the next is the index $n_j$ alone. Demanding
  $x_{n_{j+1}} > n_j$ rather than $x_{n_{j+1}} > j$ keeps that single-variable
  form, and $n_j \ge j$ ([[lem-index-map-grows]]) then upgrades the bound to the
  one actually wanted. The same trick fixes the accuracy in the finite case at
  $1/(n_j+1) \le 1/(j+1)$.

- **Claim 2 is where the $\limsup$ earns the word "greatest".** A subsequence
  cannot do better than the tail suprema allow: past any index $n$, every term of
  the sequence, and so every term of any subsequence, is at most $s_n$, and
  $\Lambda$ is the infimum of those. That is the entire content of step 2.5, and
  the strictness of the inequality $\Lambda < c$ is what gives the contradiction,
  since a limit inherits only the non-strict inequality
  ([[lem-limit-preserves-order]]).

- **Both failures of the real version really occur**, and
  [[cex-limsup-infinite-not-attained-in-r]] on the companion page is the witness:
  there $\operatorname{SL}(x)$ is nonempty with greatest element $0$ while
  $\limsup_k x_k = +\infty$.

- **The dual statement is [[cor-liminf-is-least-subsequential-limit]]**, obtained
  from this theorem by reflection rather than by repeating the construction.

The value\n  $b = +\\infty$ is incompatible with the second alternative pair, so $b$ is real,\n  hence so are $a$ and $c$, and transitivity is that of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n- *Total.* If $a = -\\infty$ or $b = +\\infty$ then $a \\le b$; if $b = -\\infty$ or\n  $a = +\\infty$ then $b \\le a$; otherwise both are real and the order of\n  $\\mathbb{R}$ is total.\n- *Preserved and reflected.* For $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ the first two clauses fail,\n  so $a \\le b$ in $\\overline{\\mathbb{R}}$ says exactly $a \\le b$ in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nIn particular $-\\infty$ is the least and $+\\infty$ the greatest element of\n$\\overline{\\mathbb{R}}$, and $-\\infty < x < +\\infty$ for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Reflection.** Extend negation by\n\n$$-(+\\infty) := -\\infty, \\qquad -(-\\infty) := +\\infty,$$\n\nkeeping the field negative on $\\mathbb{R}$. The resulting map\n$\\nu : \\overline{\\mathbb{R}} \\to \\overline{\\mathbb{R}}$, $\\nu(a) = -a$, satisfies\n$\\nu(\\nu(a)) = a$ and\n\n$$a \\le b \\iff -b \\le -a \\qquad (a, b \\in \\overline{\\mathbb{R}}).$$\n\nFor $a$ and $b$ real this is the elementwise order reversal in $\\mathbb{R}$:\ntranslation invariance ([[lem-of-add-order]]) applied with the constant $-a-b$\nturns $a < b$ into $-b < -a$ and, applied with the constant $a+b$, turns it back,\nwhile $a = b$ holds exactly when $-a = -b$. In every other case both sides are\ndecided by the first two clauses of the order: $a = -\\infty$ makes both sides\ntrue, as does $b = +\\infty$, and if $a \\ne -\\infty$, $b \\ne +\\infty$ and $a, b$\nare not both real then one of $a = +\\infty$, $b = -\\infty$ holds and both sides\nare false.\n\n**Partial addition.** For $a, b \\in \\overline{\\mathbb{R}}$ the sum $a + b$ is\ndefined by\n\n- $a + b$ = the field sum, when $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$;\n- $a + b := +\\infty$ when $a = +\\infty$ and $b \\ne -\\infty$, or $b = +\\infty$ and $a \\ne -\\infty$;\n- $a + b := -\\infty$ when $a = -\\infty$ and $b \\ne +\\infty$, or $b = -\\infty$ and $a \\ne +\\infty$;\n\nand **the two sums $(+\\infty) + (-\\infty)$ and $(-\\infty) + (+\\infty)$ are left\nundefined**. Addition is commutative where defined, and\n\n$$-(a + b) = (-a) + (-b),$$\n\neach side being defined exactly when the other is: the excluded pairs\n$\\{+\\infty, -\\infty\\}$ are exchanged by $\\nu$, and the three clauses above are\nexchanged accordingly.\n\n**Partial multiplication.** For $a, b \\in \\overline{\\mathbb{R}}$ the product $ab$\nis defined by\n\n- $ab$ = the field product, when $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$;\n- $ab := +\\infty$ when one of $a, b$ is $\\pm\\infty$, the other is $\\ne 0$, and both are $> 0$ or both are $< 0$;\n- $ab := -\\infty$ when one of $a, b$ is $\\pm\\infty$, the other is $\\ne 0$, and one is $> 0$ and the other $< 0$;\n\nand **every product with one factor $0$ and the other $\\pm\\infty$ is left\nundefined**.

## Statement refuted

That [[thm-limsup-is-greatest-subsequential-limit]] can be stated inside
$\mathbb{R}$: that for every sequence $(x_k)$ of reals the set
$\operatorname{SL}(x)$ of *real* subsequential limits ([[def-subsequential-limit]])
has a greatest element and that element is $\limsup_k x_k$.

The witness below has a nonempty $\operatorname{SL}(x)$ with a greatest element,
so the failure is not that the real set is empty: it is that the greatest element
of $\operatorname{SL}(x)$ is $0$ while $\limsup_k x_k = +\infty$. The dominant
behaviour of the sequence is invisible to $\operatorname{SL}(x)$ and is recorded
only by $\overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$ ([[def-extended-limits]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The alternating sequence $(s_k)$ and the index maps $e, o$ of [[lem-alternating-sequence]]; the canonical naturals $\iota(k) = k \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ with $\iota(0) = 0$; and the sequence $x_k := \iota(k)$ when $s_k = 1$ and $x_k := 0$ when $s_k = -1$.

[L1] The alternating sequence: $|s_k| = 1$, $s_{e_j} = 1$, $s_{o_j} = -1$, and $e$, $o$ are strictly increasing, so $e_j \ge j$ and $o_j \ge j$ ([[lem-alternating-sequence]], [[lem-index-map-grows]]).

[L2] Limit superior in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$: existence for every sequence, the tail supremum being the least upper bound of the tail range and $\limsup$ the greatest lower bound of the family of tail suprema ([[def-limsup-liminf]], [[lem-limsup-exists]], [[lem-extended-reals-complete]], [[def-upper-bound]], [[def-partial-order]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L3] The order on $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is total, $+\infty$ is greatest, every real is $< +\infty$ and $> -\infty$, and the order restricts on $\mathbb{R}$ to the order of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-extended-reals]]).

[L4] Extended subsequential limits and convergence in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$; divergence to $+\infty$ means that for every real $M$ one has $x_k > M$ eventually ([[def-extended-limits]], [[def-divergence-to-infinity]], [[def-subsequential-limit]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L5] Canonical naturals: $\iota$ is strictly increasing with $\iota(k) \ge 0$, and for every real $M$ there is a natural $p \ge 1$ with $M < \iota(p)$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[thm-of-archimedean]]).

[L6] A convergent sequence of reals is bounded, a limit is unique, and a sequence agreeing with a constant from some index on converges to that constant ([[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]], [[lem-limit-unique]], [[lem-limit-of-tail]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L7] Absolute value and order: $|t| = 1$ forces $t = 1$ or $t = -1$; $0 < 1$; the order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]], [[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[def-nat-order]], [[thm-nat-linear-order]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Each $s_k$ is $1$ or $-1$, so $(x_k)$ is a well-defined sequence of reals with $x_k \ge 0$ for every $k$; moreover $x_{e_j} = \iota(e_j)$ and $x_{o_j} = 0$ for every $j$. [given, L1, L5, L7]

1.2 The subsequence along $o$ is constantly $0$, and $o$ is strictly increasing, so $0 \in \operatorname{SL}(x)$. [given, L1, L4, L6]

2.1 For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the tail supremum $\sup T_n(x)$ is $+\infty$. Given a real $M$, take a natural $p \ge 1$ with $M < \iota(p)$ and an index $j$ at least as large as both $n$ and $p$; then $e_j \ge j \ge n$, so $x_{e_j} = \iota(e_j) \in T_n(x)$, and $e_j \ge j \ge p$ gives $\iota(e_j) \ge \iota(p) > M$. So no real number bounds $T_n(x)$ above, and the least upper bound in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ must be $+\infty$. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L3, L5, L7]

3.1 Every real subsequential limit of $(x_k)$ equals $0$. Let $n$ be strictly increasing with $x_{n_i} \to L \in \mathbb{R}$; the subsequence is then bounded, say $|x_{n_i}| \le B$ for every $i$. Suppose $s_{n_i} = 1$ for arbitrarily large $i$: taking a natural $p \ge 1$ with $B < \iota(p)$ and such an index $i \ge p$, we get $x_{n_i} = \iota(n_i) \ge \iota(i) \ge \iota(p) > B$, contradicting the bound. So there is $I$ with $s_{n_i} = -1$, hence $x_{n_i} = 0$, for every $i \ge I$; a sequence equal to $0$ from an index on converges to $0$, so $L = 0$ by uniqueness of limits. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L1, L4, L5, L6, L7]

4.1 Consequently $\limsup_k x_k$ is the greatest lower bound of the family $\{+\infty\}$, namely $+\infty$, while $\operatorname{SL}(x) = \{0\}$ by steps 1.2 and 3.1, whose greatest element is the real number $0$. Since $0 \ne +\infty$, the refuted claim fails for this sequence. [step 2.1, step 1.2, step 3.1, L2, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the extended set records.** By [[thm-limsup-is-greatest-subsequential-limit]] the element $\limsup_k x_k = +\infty$ lies in $\overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$ and is its greatest element, so $\overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x) = \{0, +\infty\}$: the value $-\infty$ is excluded because $x_k \ge 0$ for every $k$, so no subsequence can be eventually below a negative real. The real set $\operatorname{SL}(x) = \{0\}$ is exactly the finite part of it, as [[def-extended-limits]] says it must be.

- **Why the theorem cannot simply be restricted to bounded sequences.** For a bounded sequence $\limsup$ is real and the two statements agree; the point of stating [[thm-limsup-is-greatest-subsequential-limit]] in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is that it then holds for *every* sequence, with no hypothesis to check, and this witness shows the hypothesis-free version is strictly stronger.

- **A simpler witness would prove less.** The sequence $x_k = \iota(k)$ has $\operatorname{SL}(x) = \emptyset$, so the refuted claim fails there only because an empty set has no greatest element. Interleaving with $0$ makes $\operatorname{SL}(x)$ nonempty with a greatest element, so the claim fails for the substantive reason: the greatest real subsequential limit is not the limit superior.

## Statement

Let $F$ be a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and let
$\varepsilon \in F$ with $\varepsilon > 0$. Then there is a natural number
$n \ge 1$ such that

$$\frac{1}{n \cdot 1_F} < \varepsilon ,$$

where $n \cdot 1_F$ is the canonical natural of $F$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]]) and
$1/(n \cdot 1_F)$ is its multiplicative inverse ([[def-field]]). As is standard
we abbreviate $n \cdot 1_F$ to $n$ and write the conclusion $1/n < \varepsilon$.

This is the **reciprocal form** of the Archimedean property.
[[thm-of-archimedean]] on its own delivers only the assertion that the canonical
naturals are cofinal, $x < n \cdot 1_F$; the form actually used in analysis, that
the reciprocals of the naturals get below every positive bound, is the statement
above, and it is recorded separately so that no proof has to reconstruct the
inversion step in passing.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $F$ and an element $\varepsilon \in F$ with $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] Archimedean property: for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Inverses and order: if $a > 0$ then $a^{-1} > 0$, and if $0 < a < b$ then $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Field arithmetic: an element $a$ with $a > 0$ is nonzero by trichotomy, hence has a multiplicative inverse $a^{-1}$, and $(a^{-1})^{-1} = a$ ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Since $\varepsilon > 0$, trichotomy gives $\varepsilon \ne 0$, so $\varepsilon^{-1}$ exists, and $\varepsilon^{-1} > 0$. [given, L2, L3]

2.1 Apply [L1] to $x = \varepsilon^{-1}$: fix a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $\varepsilon^{-1} < n \cdot 1_F$. [step 1.1, L1, choose]

3.1 Chaining the two displayed inequalities gives $0 < \varepsilon^{-1} < n \cdot 1_F$; in particular $n \cdot 1_F > 0$, so $n \cdot 1_F \ne 0$ and $1/(n \cdot 1_F)$ is defined. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L3]

4.1 Apply the second claim of [L2] with $a = \varepsilon^{-1}$ and $b = n \cdot 1_F$: $0 < (n \cdot 1_F)^{-1} < (\varepsilon^{-1})^{-1}$. [step 3.1, L2]

5.1 By [L3], $(\varepsilon^{-1})^{-1} = \varepsilon$, so the natural number $n \ge 1$ fixed in step 2.1 satisfies $1/(n \cdot 1_F) < \varepsilon$, which is the assertion. [step 4.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Monotonicity gives the eventual form for free.** If $m \ge n \ge 1$ then
  $m \cdot 1_F \ge n \cdot 1_F > 0$, because $k \mapsto k \cdot 1_F$ is strictly
  increasing on the naturals $\ge 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]), and so
  $1/(m \cdot 1_F) \le 1/(n \cdot 1_F) < \varepsilon$ by [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]
  again. So the corollary yields not merely one index but a threshold: every
  $m \ge n$ satisfies $1/m < \varepsilon$. That one extra line is what a
  convergence proof needs, and it is left to the caller rather than folded into
  the statement, because the caller usually has a threshold of its own to combine
  it with.

- **Completeness is used only through [[thm-of-archimedean]].** Nothing here
  needs the least-upper-bound property directly. The corollary therefore holds
  verbatim in any Archimedean ordered field, in particular in $\mathbb{Q}$, and
  it fails in a non-Archimedean ordered field, where an infinitesimal
  $\varepsilon > 0$ is below every $1/n$ by construction.

- The equivalence is exact: the reciprocal form implies the cofinal form back
  again, since given $x > 0$ one applies it to $\varepsilon = 1/x$. The two are
  the same property written on the two sides of the inversion, and only the
  direction proved above is used in this library.

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]). Then
$\liminf_{k} x_k \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$ and
$\liminf_{k} x_k \le L$ for every $L \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$
([[def-limsup-liminf]], [[def-extended-limits]]).

So the extended subsequential limit set of any real sequence has a **least**
element as well as a greatest one, and the two are
$\liminf_k x_k$ and $\limsup_k x_k$ respectively
([[thm-limsup-is-greatest-subsequential-limit]]). Every extended subsequential
limit lies between them.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals, and its reflection $y_k := -x_k$.

[L1] Reflection on $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$: $a \mapsto -a$ satisfies $-(-a) = a$ and $a \le b$ if and only if $-b \le -a$ ([[def-extended-reals]]).

[L2] $\limsup_k(-x_k) = -\liminf_k x_k$ ([[lem-limsup-reflection]]).

[L3] For every real sequence the extended subsequential limit set is nonempty and has greatest element the limit superior ([[thm-limsup-is-greatest-subsequential-limit]]).

[L4] Convergence in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, subsequences and the set $\overline{\operatorname{SL}}$ ([[def-extended-limits]], [[def-subsequential-limit]], [[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L5] Scalar multiples of convergent sequences: $z_j \to z$ in $\mathbb{R}$ implies $c z_j \to c z$ ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]]).

[L6] Divergence to $\pm\infty$, and order reversal: $z_j > M$ is equivalent to $-z_j < -M$, and $M$ runs over all reals exactly when $-M$ does ([[def-divergence-to-infinity]], [[lem-of-add-order]]).

[L7] Limit superior and limit inferior of a real sequence ([[def-limsup-liminf]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Put $y_k := -x_k$, a sequence of reals; then $-y_k = x_k$ for every $k$, by the involution property of the reflection. [given, L1, L4]

1.2 Let $L \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ and let $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ be strictly increasing with $(x_{n_j})$ converging to $L$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$. [given, L4]

1.3 By [L3] applied to the sequence $(y_k)$, the set $\overline{\operatorname{SL}}(y)$ is nonempty and has greatest element $N_0 := \limsup_k y_k$, and $N_0 = -\liminf_k x_k$ by [L2]. [given, L2, L3, L7]

2.1 The reflected subsequence $(y_{n_j}) = (-x_{n_j})$ converges to $-L$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$. If $L$ is real this is the scalar rule with $c = -1$. If $L = +\infty$ then for every real $M$ there is $J$ with $x_{n_j} > M$ for all $j \ge J$, hence $y_{n_j} < -M$ for all such $j$; since $-M$ runs over all reals as $M$ does, $y_{n_j} \to -\infty = -L$. If $L = -\infty$ the same argument with the inequalities exchanged gives $y_{n_j} \to +\infty = -L$. [step 1.2, L1, L4, L5, L6]

3.1 Hence $L \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$ implies $-L \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(y)$, the same index map serving. Applying that implication to the sequence $(y_k)$, whose reflection is $(x_k)$, gives conversely that $N \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(y)$ implies $-N \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$. So $\overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x) = \{\, -N : N \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(y) \,\}$. [step 2.1, step 1.1, L1, L4]

4.1 Therefore $-N_0 \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$, and $-N_0 = -(-\liminf_k x_k) = \liminf_k x_k$; and for any $L \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$ the element $-L$ lies in $\overline{\operatorname{SL}}(y)$, so $-L \le N_0$ by maximality, whence $\liminf_k x_k = -N_0 \le L$ by order reversal. Thus $\liminf_k x_k$ is the least element of $\overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$. [step 3.1, step 1.3, L1, L2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Nothing is reconstructed.** The subsequence realising $\liminf_k x_k$ is the
  one produced by [[thm-limsup-is-greatest-subsequential-limit]] for the reflected
  sequence, read back through $y \mapsto -y$. That is the whole point of proving
  [[lem-limsup-reflection]] first: the recursion and the well-ordering argument
  are done once.

- **Combined with the greatest element, this brackets every subsequential
  limit.** For any real sequence and any $L \in \overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$,
  $$\liminf_{k} x_k \;\le\; L \;\le\; \limsup_{k} x_k,$$
  which contains [[lem-liminf-le-limsup]] as the special case obtained by taking
  for $L$ either endpoint, both of which are in the set.

- **The real subsequential limit set inherits the statement only when the value is
  finite.** If $\liminf_k x_k$ is a real number it is the least element of
  $\operatorname{SL}(x)$ as well, since the two sets agree on $\mathbb{R}$
  ([[def-extended-limits]]). If it is $-\infty$, then $\operatorname{SL}(x)$ may
  have no least element at all, or be empty.

## Definition

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]), with $\mathbb{R}$ ordered
as in [[def-real-order]] and [[def-complete-ordered-field]].

- $(x_k)$ **diverges to $+\infty$**, written $x_k \to +\infty$, when for every
  $M \in \mathbb{R}$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x_k > M$ for all
  $k \ge K$.
- $(x_k)$ **diverges to $-\infty$**, written $x_k \to -\infty$, when for every
  $M \in \mathbb{R}$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x_k < M$ for all
  $k \ge K$.

Equivalently, in the language of [[def-sequence]]: $x_k \to +\infty$ when the
property $x_k > M$ holds eventually, for every real $M$.

## Remarks

- **This is divergence, not convergence.** The symbols $+\infty$ and $-\infty$
  are **not real numbers**: $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
  ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and contains no element larger than every
  element of itself. Nothing above claims that $(x_k)$ has a limit in the sense
  of [[def-real-limit]], and nothing above defines an object named $+\infty$.
  The whole phrase "$x_k \to +\infty$" is a single abbreviation for the
  displayed condition, exactly as "$(x_k)$ is Cauchy" is an abbreviation for a
  condition and not a claim that some object called a Cauchy value exists.

- **A sequence diverging to $+\infty$ really does diverge.** Suppose
  $x_k \to +\infty$. Given any real $M$, there is $K$ with $x_k > M$ for all
  $k \ge K$; in particular $x_K > M$, so no real $M$ satisfies $x_k \le M$ for
  all $k$. Since $x_k \le |x_k|$ always ([[lem-of-abs-value]]), a bound
  $|x_k| \le M$ valid for all $k$ would give $x_k \le M$ for all $k$, which has
  just been excluded, so no such $M$ exists either. Thus
  $(x_k)$ is unbounded, and an unbounded sequence cannot converge, since
  convergent sequences are bounded ([[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]]). The
  same argument applies to $-\infty$. So the two notions never overlap: a
  sequence that diverges to $\pm\infty$ has no limit whatever.

- **Consequently $\lim_k x_k$ is not written here.** Many texts write
  $\lim_k x_k = +\infty$. This library does not, for the reason recorded in
  [[rem-sup-conventions]] about $\sup S = +\infty$: writing an equation whose
  right-hand side is not an element of $\mathbb{R}$ silently moves the discussion
  into the extended real line, a structure that is not a field, and every
  subsequent algebraic step then needs its own justification. In particular none
  of the rules of [[thm-algebra-of-limits]] may be applied to a divergence to
  $\pm\infty$; the familiar slogans "$\infty + \infty = \infty$" and
  "$\infty \cdot \infty = \infty$" are separate statements about this definition
  and would need separate proofs.

- **Testing against naturals suffices.** Since $\mathbb{R}$ is Archimedean
  ([[thm-of-archimedean]]), every real $M$ is below some canonical natural $n$,
  so the condition "for every real $M$" may equivalently be read as "for every
  natural $n \ge 1$"; the two formulations of $x_k \to +\infty$ agree.

- **Divergence to $+\infty$ is much stronger than divergence.** A sequence
  alternating between $1$ and $-1$ diverges ([[fs-bounded-implies-convergent]])
  but goes to neither $+\infty$ nor $-\infty$, since it is bounded. Divergence
  is the negation of convergence; divergence to $+\infty$ is a positive
  statement about growth.

## Definition

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]) and let
$L \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-extended-reals]]). Say that $(x_k)$
**converges to $L$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$** when one of the following holds,
according to which of the three kinds of element $L$ is:

- $L \in \mathbb{R}$ and $(x_k)$ converges to $L$ in the sense of [[def-real-limit]];
- $L = +\infty$ and $x_k \to +\infty$ in the sense of [[def-divergence-to-infinity]];
- $L = -\infty$ and $x_k \to -\infty$ in the sense of [[def-divergence-to-infinity]].

Then $L$ is an **extended subsequential limit** of $(x_k)$ when some subsequence
of $(x_k)$ converges to $L$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$: when there is a strictly
increasing $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-sequence]]) such that
$(x_{n_j})_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges to $L$ in the sense just given. The
**extended subsequential limit set** of $(x_k)$ is

$$\overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x) \;:=\; \{\, L \in \overline{\mathbb{R}} : L \text{ is an extended subsequential limit of } (x_k) \,\} \subseteq \overline{\mathbb{R}}.$$

**This extends the published [[def-subsequential-limit]] and does not replace
it.** That definition is finite by design: there $L$ ranges over $\mathbb{R}$ and
$\operatorname{SL}(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Its clause is quoted verbatim as the
first of the three clauses above, so

$$\overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x) \cap \mathbb{R} = \operatorname{SL}(x),$$

immediately from the definitions: a real $L$ lies in
$\overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$ exactly when some subsequence converges to $L$
in the sense of [[def-real-limit]], which is exactly the condition
$L \in \operatorname{SL}(x)$. The extended set is therefore
$\operatorname{SL}(x)$ together with at most the two extra points $\pm\infty$,
each present exactly when some subsequence diverges to it. Nothing about
$\operatorname{SL}(x)$ is redefined, and every statement proved about
$\operatorname{SL}(x)$ elsewhere in the library remains a statement about the
same set.

**Neither is [[def-divergence-to-infinity]] reinterpreted.** The phrase
"$x_k \to +\infty$" keeps exactly the meaning fixed there, an abbreviation for
"for every real $M$, eventually $x_k > M$". What is new is only that the phrase
is now allowed to appear as one of three clauses in a single definition whose
parameter $L$ ranges over $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, so that the three situations
can be quantified over together. In particular the warning recorded there stands:
a sequence diverging to $+\infty$ has no limit in $\mathbb{R}$, and none of the
rules of [[thm-algebra-of-limits]] applies to it.

## Remarks

- **An extended limit is unique.** Suppose $(x_k)$ converges to $L$ and to $L'$ in
  $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$. If both are real, $L = L'$ by uniqueness of real limits
  ([[lem-limit-unique]]). If one is real and the other is $\pm\infty$, that is
  impossible, because a sequence diverging to $\pm\infty$ is unbounded and so does
  not converge, as [[def-divergence-to-infinity]] records. If $L = +\infty$ and
  $L' = -\infty$ then, taking $M = 0$ in both conditions, there are $K$ and $K'$
  with $x_k > 0$ for $k \ge K$ and $x_k < 0$ for $k \ge K'$; any index at least as
  large as both gives $0 < x_k < 0$, which is impossible. So the three clauses are
  mutually exclusive and each determines $L$.

- **Why the extended set is the right object for a $\limsup$ theorem.** The
  greatest subsequential limit of an arbitrary real sequence need not be a real
  number: the sequence that alternates between $0$ and larger and larger values
  has $\operatorname{SL}(x) = \{0\}$, whose greatest element is $0$, while the
  behaviour that dominates it is a subsequence running off to $+\infty$. That is
  exactly the content of [[cex-limsup-infinite-not-attained-in-r]], and it is why
  [[thm-limsup-is-greatest-subsequential-limit]] is stated for
  $\overline{\operatorname{SL}}(x)$ rather than for $\operatorname{SL}(x)$.

- **A tail changes nothing.** A strictly increasing index map satisfies
  $n_j \ge j$ ([[lem-index-map-grows]]), so all three clauses depend only on the
  behaviour of $(x_k)$ at arbitrarily large indices, and a sequence and each of
  its tails have the same extended subsequential limit set. This is the same
  observation made for $\operatorname{SL}(x)$ in [[def-subsequential-limit]], with
  the two divergence clauses added.

## Definition

Fix two objects $-\infty$ and $+\infty$, distinct from one another and neither of
them a real number ([[def-real-numbers]]), and set

$$\overline{\mathbb{R}} := \mathbb{R} \cup \{-\infty, +\infty\}.$$

This is a **new object**, introduced here explicitly with its own order and its
own partial arithmetic. It is not an enlargement of the field $\mathbb{R}$, and
no operation of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) is redefined by
anything below.

**The order.** For $a, b \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ declare

$$a \le b \quad :\Longleftrightarrow \quad a = -\infty \ \text{ or } \ b = +\infty \ \text{ or } \ \big(a, b \in \mathbb{R} \text{ and } a \le b \text{ in } \mathbb{R}\big),$$

with $\mathbb{R}$ ordered as in [[def-real-order]], and write $a < b$ for
"$a \le b$ and $a \ne b$" as usual ([[def-partial-order]]).

**$(\overline{\mathbb{R}}, \le)$ is a totally ordered set, and the inclusion of
$\mathbb{R}$ preserves and reflects the order.** All four checks are immediate
from the displayed clauses.

- *Reflexive.* For $a = \pm\infty$ one of the first two clauses applies; for
  $a \in \mathbb{R}$ the third does, since $a \le a$ in $\mathbb{R}$.
- *Antisymmetric.* Suppose $a \le b$ and $b \le a$. If $a = -\infty$ then
  $b \le a$ forces $b = -\infty$, since the clause $a = +\infty$ fails and $b, a$
  are not both real. Symmetrically $b = -\infty$ forces $a = -\infty$, and
  $a = +\infty$ or $b = +\infty$ forces the other to be $+\infty$. In the one
  remaining situation $a$ and $b$ are both real and antisymmetry is that of
  $\mathbb{R}$.
- *Transitive.* Let $a \le b \le c$. If $a = -\infty$ or $c = +\infty$ the
  conclusion is one of the first two clauses. Otherwise $a \ne -\infty$ forces,
  in $a \le b$, either $b = +\infty$ or $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$; and $c \ne +\infty$
  forces, in $b \le c$, either $b = -\infty$ or $b, c \in \mathbb{R}$. The value
  $b = +\infty$ is incompatible with the second alternative pair, so $b$ is real,
  hence so are $a$ and $c$, and transitivity is that of $\mathbb{R}$.
- *Total.* If $a = -\infty$ or $b = +\infty$ then $a \le b$; if $b = -\infty$ or
  $a = +\infty$ then $b \le a$; otherwise both are real and the order of
  $\mathbb{R}$ is total.
- *Preserved and reflected.* For $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ the first two clauses fail,
  so $a \le b$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ says exactly $a \le b$ in $\mathbb{R}$.

In particular $-\infty$ is the least and $+\infty$ the greatest element of
$\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, and $-\infty < x < +\infty$ for every $x \in \mathbb{R}$.

**Reflection.** Extend negation by

$$-(+\infty) := -\infty, \qquad -(-\infty) := +\infty,$$

keeping the field negative on $\mathbb{R}$. The resulting map
$\nu : \overline{\mathbb{R}} \to \overline{\mathbb{R}}$, $\nu(a) = -a$, satisfies
$\nu(\nu(a)) = a$ and

$$a \le b \iff -b \le -a \qquad (a, b \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}).$$

For $a$ and $b$ real this is the elementwise order reversal in $\mathbb{R}$:
translation invariance ([[lem-of-add-order]]) applied with the constant $-a-b$
turns $a < b$ into $-b < -a$ and, applied with the constant $a+b$, turns it back,
while $a = b$ holds exactly when $-a = -b$. In every other case both sides are
decided by the first two clauses of the order: $a = -\infty$ makes both sides
true, as does $b = +\infty$, and if $a \ne -\infty$, $b \ne +\infty$ and $a, b$
are not both real then one of $a = +\infty$, $b = -\infty$ holds and both sides
are false.

**Partial addition.** For $a, b \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ the sum $a + b$ is
defined by

- $a + b$ = the field sum, when $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$;
- $a + b := +\infty$ when $a = +\infty$ and $b \ne -\infty$, or $b = +\infty$ and $a \ne -\infty$;
- $a + b := -\infty$ when $a = -\infty$ and $b \ne +\infty$, or $b = -\infty$ and $a \ne +\infty$;

and **the two sums $(+\infty) + (-\infty)$ and $(-\infty) + (+\infty)$ are left
undefined**. Addition is commutative where defined, and

$$-(a + b) = (-a) + (-b),$$

each side being defined exactly when the other is: the excluded pairs
$\{+\infty, -\infty\}$ are exchanged by $\nu$, and the three clauses above are
exchanged accordingly.

**Partial multiplication.** For $a, b \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ the product $ab$
is defined by

- $ab$ = the field product, when $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$;
- $ab := +\infty$ when one of $a, b$ is $\pm\infty$, the other is $\ne 0$, and both are $> 0$ or both are $< 0$;
- $ab := -\infty$ when one of $a, b$ is $\pm\infty$, the other is $\ne 0$, and one is $> 0$ and the other $< 0$;

and **every product with one factor $0$ and the other $\pm\infty$ is left
undefined**. The comparisons $> 0$ and $< 0$ here are taken in the order above,
under which $+\infty > 0 > -\infty$.

**Nothing else is defined.** There is no subtraction, no division, no
exponentiation and no absolute value on $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ in this library;
where such an expression is wanted it is written out in the two defined
operations, and where a case falls in the undefined list the statement carries an
explicit hypothesis saying so.

## Remarks

- **$\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is not a field, and not an ordered field.** It has no
  additive inverse for $+\infty$: $(+\infty) + b$ is $+\infty$ whenever it is
  defined and is never $0$. So none of the field axioms
  ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) is available here, and no algebraic
  manipulation valid in $\mathbb{R}$ may be transported to
  $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ without a separate justification.

- **Why the excluded cases are excluded.** The three defined clauses of each
  operation are exactly the cases in which the value is forced by the limiting
  behaviour of the sequences involved, and the excluded cases are exactly the
  ones in which it is not. For the product this is proved on the companion page:
  [[cex-zero-times-infinity-indeterminate]] exhibits a null sequence and two
  sequences diverging to $+\infty$ whose products behave differently, so no value
  assigned to $0 \cdot (+\infty)$ could be compatible with products of limits.
  The same phenomenon rules out a value for $(+\infty) + (-\infty)$: with
  $a_k = k$ and $b_k = -k$ the sum is constantly $0$, while with $b_k = -2k$ it
  diverges to $-\infty$. Leaving them undefined is not squeamishness, it is the
  only option that keeps every later statement about limits true without a
  side condition hidden inside the arithmetic.

- **This is the separate introduction that [[rem-sup-conventions]] points to.**
  That remark refuses the conventions $\sup S = +\infty$ and
  $\inf \emptyset = +\infty$ inside $\mathbb{R}$, and records that the extended
  real line is introduced explicitly here, with its own order and its own partial
  arithmetic kept separate from $\mathbb{R}$ rather than quietly extending it.
  This is that introduction. The suprema and infima of [[def-complete-ordered-field]],
  [[def-infimum]] and the whole suprema page remain real numbers with their
  nonempty and bounded hypotheses intact; what is new is a *separate* supremum
  operation, taken in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ and named as such, supplied by
  [[lem-extended-reals-complete]].

- **The symbols were already in circulation, and this definition does not change
  what they meant.** [[def-divergence-to-infinity]] defines the single phrase
  "$x_k \to +\infty$" as an abbreviation for a condition on $(x_k)$, and says in
  as many words that it does not define an object named $+\infty$. That reading
  is still correct: nothing in [[def-divergence-to-infinity]] is restated or
  reinterpreted here, and [[def-extended-limits]] is where the two are related, by
  a definition that quotes the old one rather than replacing it. Likewise the
  interval notation $(a, \infty)$ of [[def-interval]] is notation for a condition
  on one side, not an endpoint, and stays that way.

- **Why the order is defined by three clauses rather than by a picture.** The
  clauses are what the verifications above actually use, and they make the two
  facts that later proofs lean on immediate: every element is $\le +\infty$ and
  every element is $\ge -\infty$, with no case analysis at the point of use.

## Definition

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]). For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ let

$$T_n \;:=\; \{\, x_k : k \in \mathbb{N},\ k \ge n \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$$

be the **$n$-th tail range** of $(x_k)$, a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ since
$x_n \in T_n$. Regard $T_n$ as a subset of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$
([[def-extended-reals]]) and put

$$s_n \;:=\; \sup T_n \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}, \qquad i_n \;:=\; \inf T_n \in \overline{\mathbb{R}},$$

the supremum and infimum taken in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, which exist for every
$n$ and for every sequence by [[lem-extended-reals-complete]]. The **limit
superior** and **limit inferior** of $(x_k)$ are then

$$\limsup_{k} x_k \;:=\; \inf \{\, s_n : n \in \mathbb{N} \,\}, \qquad \liminf_{k} x_k \;:=\; \sup \{\, i_n : n \in \mathbb{N} \,\},$$

again taken in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ and again existing by
[[lem-extended-reals-complete]], since $\{s_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ and
$\{i_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ are subsets of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ on which no
hypothesis is needed. Both are elements of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, and either may
be $+\infty$ or $-\infty$. The notations $\limsup_{k \to \infty} x_k$,
$\varlimsup_k x_k$ and $\overline{\lim}_k x_k$ all denote the first of them
elsewhere; this library writes $\limsup_k x_k$.

**Every quantity written here exists, and that is why the extended line was
introduced.** Each of the four operations above is an application of
[[lem-extended-reals-complete]] to a subset of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ carrying no
hypothesis whatever. Written with the real supremum of
[[def-complete-ordered-field]] and the real infimum of [[thm-infimum-property]]
instead, the definition would be available only for sequences that are bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]): $\sup T_n$ needs $T_n$ bounded above, and
$\inf\{s_n\}$ needs $\{s_n\}$ nonempty, bounded below, and made of real numbers
([[def-infimum]]). None of those is automatic, and the discipline recorded in
[[rem-sup-conventions]] forbids papering over the gap with a convention. The
extended supremum is a different operation in a different ordered set, and it is
total.

**Values, when the sequence is bounded.** If $(x_k)$ is bounded, say
$|x_k| \le M$ for every $k$, then each $T_n$ is a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$
bounded above by $M$ and below by $-M$, so by the agreement clause of
[[lem-extended-reals-complete]] each $s_n$ and each $i_n$ is the *real* supremum
or infimum of $T_n$, and lies in $[-M, M]$. The family $\{s_n\}$ is then a
nonempty set of reals bounded below by $-M$, so $\limsup_k x_k$ is likewise the
real infimum of $\{s_n\}$ and lies in $[-M, M]$; dually for $\liminf_k x_k$. So
for a bounded sequence both quantities are ordinary real numbers computed with
the ordinary real supremum and infimum, and the extended line is doing no work.
It is only for unbounded sequences that the values $\pm\infty$ occur.

## Remarks

- **The order of the two operations is not symmetric and must be kept straight.**
  $\limsup$ is an infimum of suprema and $\liminf$ a supremum of infima. Taking
  them in the other order gives $\sup_n \sup_{k \ge n} x_k = \sup_k x_k$ and
  $\inf_n \inf_{k \ge n} x_k = \inf_k x_k$, which are the extreme values of the
  whole sequence and carry no information about its behaviour at large indices.
  The point of the definition is that the inner operation looks at a tail and the
  outer one lets the tail recede.

- **Why tails at all.** Each $s_n$ is a bound on the whole tail from index $n$ on,
  so it forgets the first $n$ terms; letting $n$ grow forgets any fixed finite
  number of them. That is what makes $\limsup$ and $\liminf$ tail quantities in
  the sense of [[lem-limit-of-tail]], and it is the reason they can characterise
  convergence, which is itself a tail property.

- **Neither quantity is a limit, and neither is claimed to be one.** The symbols
  $\limsup$ and $\liminf$ are single pieces of notation for the two displayed
  expressions, exactly as "$x_k \to +\infty$" is a single abbreviation in
  [[def-divergence-to-infinity]]. That the family $(s_n)$ does decrease to
  $\limsup_k x_k$ in a precise sense is a theorem, not part of this definition;
  the monotonicity half is [[lem-limsup-exists]].

- **The tail ranges are sets, not sequences.** $T_n$ is the range of the $n$-th
  tail, so repetitions and order are forgotten ([[def-sequence]]). That is
  harmless here, since a supremum depends only on the set of values, and it is
  what lets the whole definition be phrased with the order-theoretic operations of
  [[lem-extended-reals-complete]] and nothing else.

## Definition

For $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, define the **order** by

$$m \le n \iff \exists k \in \mathbb{N}\ (m + k = n),$$

and the **strict order** by $m < n \iff (m \le n \text{ and } m \neq n)$, using
addition ([[def-nat-addition]]).

## Remarks

Read $m \le n$ as "$n$ is $m$ plus something": the gap $k$ with $m + k = n$ is
unique when it exists (by commutativity and cancellation,
[[lem-nat-add-commutative]], [[lem-nat-add-cancellative]]) and is
written $n - m$ once subtraction is available. That $\le$ is genuinely a linear
order, reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive, and total, is proved in
[[thm-nat-linear-order]] and [[lem-nat-trichotomy]]; compatibility with the
arithmetic ([[lem-nat-order-add-compatible]],
[[lem-nat-order-mult-compatible]]) and discreteness
($m < n \iff \sigma(m) \le n$, [[lem-nat-discrete]]) follow.

In the von Neumann model this order coincides with membership and inclusion:
$m \le n \iff m \subseteq n$ and $m < n \iff m \in n$, matching the picture of
each natural number as the set $\{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ of its predecessors
([[def-natural-numbers]]). That coincidence is not proved here; it is derived
from the additive definition above on a later page. The least-element property of every nonempty subset,
the **well-ordering principle** ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]), is the deepest
consequence.

## Definition

Let $P$ be a set. A **partial order** on $P$ is a binary relation $\le$ on $P$
such that, for all $x, y, z \in P$:

- **(R)** *reflexivity*: $x \le x$;
- **(A)** *antisymmetry*: if $x \le y$ and $y \le x$, then $x = y$;
- **(T)** *transitivity*: if $x \le y$ and $y \le z$, then $x \le z$.

The pair $(P, \le)$ is a **partially ordered set**, abbreviated **poset**. When
the order is clear we write $P$ for the pair.

The associated **strict order** is defined by
$$x < y \quad :\Longleftrightarrow \quad x \le y \text{ and } x \ne y.$$

Two elements $x, y \in P$ are **comparable** if $x \le y$ or $y \le x$, and
**incomparable** otherwise. A partial order in which every two elements are
comparable is a **total order** (equivalently a **linear order**), and $(P, \le)$
is then a **totally ordered set**.

## Remarks

- Partiality is the whole point: a partial order is permitted to leave pairs
  incomparable, which is what makes maximal elements and chains worth
  distinguishing at all. In a total order every subset is a chain, and a maximal
  element is automatically the greatest element.
- All three axioms are used essentially in the proofs that rest on this
  definition: reflexivity in [[lem-extremal-cut-closed-under-f]] and
  [[lem-successor-of-extremal]],
  transitivity almost everywhere, and antisymmetry in [[thm-bourbaki-witt]],
  where the fixed point is obtained by passing from $f(c) \le c$ and
  $c \le f(c)$ to $f(c) = c$. Antisymmetry is also what makes a least upper
  bound unique when it exists, and uniqueness is what licenses the functional
  notation $\sup$ used in [[def-chain-complete-poset]].
- Dropping antisymmetry gives a **preorder**. Preorders are genuinely useful
  elsewhere (a directed set is preordered).
- Inclusion $\subseteq$ on the power set of any set is the standard example, and
  it is the order that appears concretely in [[thm-zorn]], which applies
  [[thm-bourbaki-witt]] to the set of chains of $P$ ordered by inclusion, and in
  [[thm-zorn-implies-ac]], which applies Zorn's lemma to partial choice
  functions ordered by extension, an inclusion order on their graphs. The
  results themselves are stated for an *arbitrary* poset and are used that way:
  [[thm-zorn]] is applied to whatever poset a later page brings, and the
  refutation in
  [[fs-maximal-is-greatest]] runs in a bare two-element antichain that is not
  presented as an order by inclusion at all.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]],
[[def-real-numbers]]) with its order and absolute value ([[def-real-order]]), and
$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers with its order ([[def-natural-numbers]],
[[def-nat-order]]).

A **sequence of reals** is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$. We write
$x_k$ for the value $x(k)$, call it the **$k$-th term**, and write $(x_k)$, or
$(x_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$, for the function itself. The **range** of $(x_k)$ is
the subset $\{\, x_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals and let $P$ be a property of indices.

- $(x_k)$ is **bounded** if there is $M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for
  every $k \in \mathbb{N}$; it is **unbounded** otherwise.
- $P$ holds **eventually** if there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $P(k)$ holds
  for every $k \ge K$.
- $P$ holds **frequently** if for every $K \in \mathbb{N}$ there is some
  $k \ge K$ for which $P(k)$ holds.
- For $K \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$K$-th tail** of $(x_k)$ is the sequence
  $x^{(K)}$ defined by $x^{(K)}_j := x_{j + K}$ for $j \in \mathbb{N}$; it is
  again a sequence of reals.
- A function $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is **strictly increasing** if
  $n_j < n_k$ whenever $j < k$. For such an $n$, the **subsequence** of $(x_k)$
  along $n$ is the composite $x \circ n$, written $(x_{n_k})_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$;
  it is again a sequence of reals.

**Convergence and Cauchyness are not defined here.** They are already fixed, for
sequences of reals, by the published [[def-real-limit]]: $(x_k)$ *converges* to
$x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is
$K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$, and $(x_k)$
is *Cauchy* when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$
with $|x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$. This page builds the
toolkit for those two notions and does not restate them. A sequence
**converges** if it converges to some real, and **diverges** if it does not.

## Remarks

- **Identification of $\mathbb{Q}$ with its image.** The map $q \mapsto \hat q$
  is an embedding of ordered fields ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and as is
  standard we write $q$ for $\hat q$, so that a rational may be compared with a
  real without further comment. [[def-real-limit]] is stated with the hat; every
  rational $\varepsilon$ occurring on this page is its image under this
  embedding.

- **Rational and real $\varepsilon$ agree.** [[def-real-limit]] tests convergence
  against every *rational* $\varepsilon > 0$, and its own remark records that
  this loses nothing. Spelled out: suppose that for every rational
  $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all
  $k \ge K$, and let $\eta > 0$ be an arbitrary *real*. Since $0 < \eta$,
  density of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) supplies a
  rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, and the index $K$
  belonging to that $\varepsilon$ satisfies $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon < \eta$ for
  all $k \ge K$. The converse implication is immediate, since every positive
  rational is a positive real. So the two formulations define the same relation,
  and the same two lines apply verbatim to the Cauchy condition and to any
  condition of the shape "for every $\varepsilon > 0$, eventually
  $\cdots < \varepsilon$". Proofs on this page therefore run the test with a real
  $\varepsilon$ wherever that is more convenient, and say so by citing this
  remark; nothing is smuggled in.

- **Constant sequences converge.** For $c \in \mathbb{R}$ the constant sequence
  $x_k := c$ converges to $c$, because $|x_k - c| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ for
  every $\varepsilon > 0$ and every $k$; it is bounded by $|c|$.

- **Eventually and frequently are dual.** $P$ holds frequently exactly when
  $\lnot P$ does not hold eventually, and $P$ holds eventually exactly when
  $\lnot P$ does not hold frequently. So the two quantifier patterns are
  negations of one another applied to the complementary property, and there is no
  third pattern hiding between them.

- **A sequence is not its range.** $(x_k)$ is a function, not a set, and the
  range does not determine the function: the sequence $x_0 = 0$, $x_k = 1$ for
  $k \ge 1$ and the sequence $y_0 = y_1 = 0$, $y_k = 1$ for $k \ge 2$ have the
  same range $\{0, 1\}$, yet they differ at $k = 1$, so they are different
  sequences. Order and repetition are part of the data and the range forgets
  both. Boundedness, on the other hand, depends only on the range.

- **Indexing.** Sequences here start at $k = 0$ because $\mathbb{N}$ contains
  $0$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]). Texts that index from $1$ describe the same
  objects up to a shift, and the shift changes nothing about convergence, by
  [[lem-limit-of-tail]].

## Definition

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]) and let $L \in \mathbb{R}$.
Then $L$ is a **subsequential limit** of $(x_k)$ when some subsequence of $(x_k)$
converges to $L$: that is, when there is a strictly increasing
$n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that

$$x_{n_j} \longrightarrow L \qquad (j \to \infty)$$

in the sense of [[def-real-limit]]. The **subsequential limit set** of $(x_k)$ is

$$\operatorname{SL}(x) \;:=\; \{\, L \in \mathbb{R} : L \text{ is a subsequential limit of } (x_k) \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}.$$

Both pieces of the definition are already fixed elsewhere and are only combined
here: *strictly increasing* and *subsequence* are [[def-sequence]], and
*converges* is [[def-real-limit]]. Nothing about $(x_k)$ itself is assumed; in
particular $(x_k)$ is not assumed to converge, and $\operatorname{SL}(x)$ may be
empty, a single point, or larger.

**A subsequence looks arbitrarily far out.** A strictly increasing index map
satisfies $n_j \ge j$ for every $j$ ([[lem-index-map-grows]]), so the indices
$n_j$ are cofinal in $\mathbb{N}$ and a subsequential limit is determined by the
behaviour of $(x_k)$ at arbitrarily large indices. Consequently no finite
initial segment of $(x_k)$ affects $\operatorname{SL}(x)$: a sequence and each of
its tails have the same subsequential limits.

**Terminology.** Some texts say *cluster point*, *limit point* or *accumulation
value* of the sequence for the same notion. This library says *subsequential
limit* throughout, reserving *limit point* for the topological notion of a limit
point of a set, which is a different thing: the set $\{x_k\}$ of values of the
constant sequence $x_k = 0$ has no limit point, while $0$ is a subsequential
limit of that sequence.

## Remarks

- **A convergent sequence has exactly one subsequential limit, its limit.** If
  $x_k \to x$ then every subsequence converges to $x$
  ([[lem-subsequence-inherits-limit]]), so every subsequential limit equals $x$
  by uniqueness of limits ([[lem-limit-unique]]); and $x$ itself is one, taking
  $n_j = j$, which is strictly increasing. So $\operatorname{SL}(x) = \{x\}$. The
  converse fails: $\operatorname{SL}$ being a single point does not force
  convergence, as the unbounded sequence of
  [[cex-unbounded-with-convergent-subsequence]] shows.

- **The subsequential limit set can be empty.** The sequence $x_k = k$ has no
  subsequential limit at all, since every subsequence is unbounded and an
  unbounded sequence does not converge ([[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]]).
  Bolzano-Weierstrass ([[thm-bolzano-weierstrass]]) says exactly that
  boundedness is what rules this out: for a bounded sequence,
  $\operatorname{SL}(x) \ne \emptyset$.

- **It can also be large.** The alternating sequence of
  [[lem-alternating-sequence]] has subsequential limit set $\{-1, 1\}$, and
  [[ex-two-subsequential-limits]] carries out that computation for a sequence
  that converges to neither. The systematic study of $\operatorname{SL}(x)$, in
  particular that it has a greatest and a least element for a bounded sequence,
  belongs to the $\limsup$ page and is not begun here.

## Definition

Let $(P, \le)$ be a poset ([[def-partial-order]]) and $S \subseteq P$.

An element $u \in P$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \le u$ for every
$s \in S$.

An element $u \in P$ is a **least upper bound** (or **supremum**) of $S$ if $u$
is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le v$ for every upper bound $v$ of $S$. When it
exists we write $u = \sup S$.

An element $u \in P$ is a **strict upper bound** of $S$ if $s < u$ for every
$s \in S$.

## Remarks

- **A least upper bound is unique when it exists.** If $u$ and $u'$ are both
  least upper bounds of $S$ then each is an upper bound and each is below the
  other, so $u \le u'$ and $u' \le u$, whence $u = u'$ by antisymmetry
  ([[def-partial-order]]). This is what makes the notation $\sup S$ legitimate.
  Antisymmetry is not peculiar to this argument: the same two-inequality step
  gives uniqueness of a greatest element ([[def-maximal-element]]), and it is
  used essentially in [[thm-bourbaki-witt]], whose fixed point is obtained by
  passing from $f(c) \le c$ and $c \le f(c)$ to $f(c) = c$. Drop antisymmetry
  and it is the conclusion, not merely the notation, that goes: on two distinct
  elements each below the other, every subset still has a least upper bound, yet
  the map exchanging the two satisfies $x \le f(x)$ and has no fixed point.
- **Every element of $P$ is an upper bound of the empty set**, vacuously.
  Consequently $\sup \emptyset$, when it exists, is the least element of $P$.
- An upper bound of $S$ need not belong to $S$, and $S$ may have many upper
  bounds and no least one. In $\mathbb{Q}$ with its usual order, the set
  $\{q \in \mathbb{Q} : q^2 < 2\}$ has upper bounds but no least upper bound.
- In a poset, a strict upper bound is exactly an upper bound outside $S$. If
  $u$ is strict then $u\notin S$, since $u<u$ is impossible. Conversely, if
  $u$ is an upper bound and $u\notin S$, then every $s\in S$ satisfies
  $s\le u$ and $s\ne u$, hence $s<u$. This distinction from an arbitrary upper
  bound matters in [[thm-zorn]], where the argument must produce one outside
  the chain.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ be **any** subset of the extended real
line ([[def-extended-reals]]) and write $A_{\mathbb{R}} := A \cap \mathbb{R}$.
Then $A$ has a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound in
$\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-upper-bound]]), each unique, which we write
$\sup A$ and $\inf A$ with the ambient set always $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$.
Explicitly:

- $\sup A = +\infty$ if $+\infty \in A$, or if $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ is not bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$;
- $\sup A = -\infty$ if $+\infty \notin A$ and $A_{\mathbb{R}} = \emptyset$;
- $\sup A$ is the real supremum $\sup A_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) if $+\infty \notin A$ and $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ is nonempty and bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$;

and dually, with $-\infty$ and $+\infty$ exchanged and "above" replaced by
"below", for $\inf A$ ([[def-infimum]], [[thm-infimum-property]]).

**Agreement.** If $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and bounded above in
$\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-bounded-set]]) then $\sup A$ computed in
$\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is the real number $\sup A$ of
[[def-complete-ordered-field]]; if $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and
bounded below then $\inf A$ computed in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is the real
number $\inf A$ of [[thm-infimum-property]]. In particular the notation is
unambiguous on the sets for which the real supremum and infimum are defined, and
$\sup \emptyset = -\infty$, $\inf \emptyset = +\infty$ in
$\overline{\mathbb{R}}$.

**No hypothesis is placed on $A$.** This is exactly what the real supremum cannot
do, and it is why every $\limsup$ statement on this page holds for every sequence
rather than for bounded ones only. It is also not a weakening of the discipline
this library keeps around suprema: the operation supplied here is a *different*
operation, taken in a *different* ordered set, and the agreement clause records
exactly where the two coincide.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $A \subseteq \overline{\mathbb{R}}$, and its real part $A_{\mathbb{R}} := A \cap \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] $(\overline{\mathbb{R}}, \le)$ is a totally ordered set in which $-\infty$ is the least element and $+\infty$ the greatest, and whose order restricted to $\mathbb{R}$ is the order of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-extended-reals]], [[def-partial-order]], [[def-real-order]]).

[L2] Upper and lower bounds in a poset: $u$ is an upper bound of $A$ when $a \le u$ for all $a \in A$, and a least upper bound when moreover $u \le v$ for every upper bound $v$; dually for lower bounds and greatest lower bounds. Each is unique when it exists, by antisymmetry ([[def-upper-bound]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L3] Least-upper-bound property of $\mathbb{R}$: every nonempty $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$ has a real least upper bound $\sup S$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L4] Greatest-lower-bound property of $\mathbb{R}$: every nonempty $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ that is bounded below in $\mathbb{R}$ has a real greatest lower bound $\inf S$ ([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]).

[L5] Bounded above and bounded below in $\mathbb{R}$ mean the existence of a real upper, respectively lower, bound ([[def-bounded-set]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Case S1 for the supremum: $+\infty \in A$. [given, assume-case suptop]

1.2 Case S2 for the supremum: $+\infty \notin A$ and $A_{\mathbb{R}} = \emptyset$, so that every element of $A$ equals $-\infty$. [given, assume-case supbot]

1.3 Case S3 for the supremum: $+\infty \notin A$, $A_{\mathbb{R}} \ne \emptyset$, and $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ is bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$. [given, assume-case supfin]

1.4 Case S4 for the supremum: $+\infty \notin A$, $A_{\mathbb{R}} \ne \emptyset$, and $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ is not bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$. [given, assume-case supunb]

1.5 Case I1 for the infimum: $-\infty \in A$. [given, assume-case infbot]

1.6 Case I2 for the infimum: $-\infty \notin A$ and $A_{\mathbb{R}} = \emptyset$, so that every element of $A$ equals $+\infty$. [given, assume-case inftop]

1.7 Case I3 for the infimum: $-\infty \notin A$, $A_{\mathbb{R}} \ne \emptyset$, and $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ is bounded below in $\mathbb{R}$. [given, assume-case inffin]

1.8 Case I4 for the infimum: $-\infty \notin A$, $A_{\mathbb{R}} \ne \emptyset$, and $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ is not bounded below in $\mathbb{R}$. [given, assume-case infunb]

2.1 In case S1 the element $+\infty$ is an upper bound of $A$, being the greatest element of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$; and if $v$ is any upper bound of $A$ then $+\infty \in A$ gives $+\infty \le v$, whence $v = +\infty$ by antisymmetry. So $+\infty$ is the least upper bound of $A$. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.2 In case S2 every element of $A$ equals $-\infty$, so $-\infty$ is an upper bound of $A$ by reflexivity; and $-\infty \le v$ for every $v \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$, being the least element. So $-\infty$ is the least upper bound of $A$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.3 In case S3 the real number $\sigma := \sup A_{\mathbb{R}}$ exists, and it is an upper bound of $A$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$: an element of $A$ is either real, hence lies in $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ and satisfies $a \le \sigma$ in $\mathbb{R}$ and so in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, or equals $-\infty$, which is $\le \sigma$; the value $+\infty$ does not occur in $A$ in this case. [step 1.3, L1, L3]

2.4 In case S4 the element $+\infty$ is an upper bound of $A$; and if $v$ is an upper bound then $v \ne -\infty$, because fixing $a \in A_{\mathbb{R}}$, which is possible in this case, gives $a \le v$ with $a$ real and $-\infty$ is below no real, while $v$ real would make $v$ a real upper bound of $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ and contradict the case hypothesis. So $v = +\infty$, and $+\infty$ is the least upper bound of $A$. [step 1.4, L1, L2, L5]

2.5 In case I1 the element $-\infty$ is a lower bound of $A$, being least; and any lower bound $w$ satisfies $w \le -\infty$ because $-\infty \in A$, whence $w = -\infty$ by antisymmetry. So $-\infty$ is the greatest lower bound of $A$. [step 1.5, L1, L2]

2.6 In case I2 every element of $A$ equals $+\infty$, so $+\infty$ is a lower bound of $A$ by reflexivity, and $w \le +\infty$ for every $w$. So $+\infty$ is the greatest lower bound of $A$. [step 1.6, L1, L2]

2.7 In case I3 the real number $\iota := \inf A_{\mathbb{R}}$ exists and is a lower bound of $A$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$: an element of $A$ is either real, hence in $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ and $\ge \iota$, or equals $+\infty \ge \iota$; the value $-\infty$ does not occur in $A$ in this case. [step 1.7, L1, L4]

2.8 In case I4 the element $-\infty$ is a lower bound of $A$; any lower bound $w$ satisfies $w \ne +\infty$, because fixing $a \in A_{\mathbb{R}}$ gives $w \le a$ with $a$ real and $+\infty$ is above no real, while $w$ real would be a real lower bound of $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ and contradict the case hypothesis. So $w = -\infty$ is the greatest lower bound of $A$. [step 1.8, L1, L2, L5]

3.1 In case S3 let $v$ be any upper bound of $A$ and fix $a \in A_{\mathbb{R}}$, which is possible since $A_{\mathbb{R}} \ne \emptyset$. From $a \le v$ with $a$ real we get $v \ne -\infty$, since $-\infty$ is below no real. If $v = +\infty$ then $\sigma \le v$ because $+\infty$ is greatest. Otherwise $v$ is real, and it bounds $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ above in $\mathbb{R}$, so $\sigma \le v$ by leastness of the real supremum. Hence $\sigma$ is the least upper bound of $A$. [step 1.3, step 2.3, L1, L2, L3]

3.2 In case I3 let $w$ be a lower bound of $A$ and fix $a \in A_{\mathbb{R}}$. From $w \le a$ with $a$ real we get $w \ne +\infty$. If $w = -\infty$ then $w \le \iota$; otherwise $w$ is real and bounds $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ below in $\mathbb{R}$, so $w \le \iota$. Hence $\iota$ is the greatest lower bound of $A$. [step 1.7, step 2.7, L1, L2, L4]

4.1 The four supremum cases are exhaustive and mutually exclusive: either $+\infty \in A$, which is S1, or not, and then either $A_{\mathbb{R}} = \emptyset$, which is S2, or $A_{\mathbb{R}} \ne \emptyset$ and it is bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$, which is S3, or it is not, which is S4. In each case a least upper bound was produced, and it is unique. The same four alternatives with $-\infty$, $+\infty$ and "below" in place of $+\infty$, $-\infty$ and "above" are I1 to I4, and in each a greatest lower bound was produced. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, step 2.4, step 2.5, step 2.6, step 3.2, step 2.8, L2, L5, cases: a two-fold split followed by a three-fold split, cases-exhaustive]

5.1 The agreement clause follows: a nonempty $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$ satisfies $+\infty \notin A$ and $A_{\mathbb{R}} = A$, so case S3 applies and $\sup A = \sup A_{\mathbb{R}}$ is the real supremum; a nonempty $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ bounded below satisfies case I3 and $\inf A$ is the real infimum; and $A = \emptyset$ falls under S2 and I2, giving $\sup \emptyset = -\infty$ and $\inf \emptyset = +\infty$. [step 2.3, step 3.1, step 2.7, step 3.2, step 4.1, L3, L4] ∎

## Remarks

- **What makes this work is that $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ has a top and a bottom.**
  The three defining clauses of the order ([[def-extended-reals]]) put $+\infty$
  above everything and $-\infty$ below everything, and every case above is settled
  by one of those two facts or by the least-upper-bound property of $\mathbb{R}$
  applied to the real part. Nothing else about $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is used,
  and in particular no arithmetic is used at all.

- **The two exceptional cases of [[fs-every-set-has-sup]] are not repaired, they
  are relocated.** That false statement records that in $\mathbb{R}$ a set may
  fail to have a supremum, and it stays true; the discipline of
  [[rem-sup-conventions]], which refuses to write $\sup S = +\infty$ inside
  $\mathbb{R}$, also stays in force. What is proved here is a statement about a
  different ordered set.

- **The empty set is not an exception here, and that is the point of the
  ambient set.** In $\mathbb{R}$ the empty set has no supremum, because every
  real is an upper bound and there is no least one.
  In $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ every element is still an upper bound of $\emptyset$,
  but now there *is* a least one, namely $-\infty$. The two statements are about
  different ordered sets and neither contradicts the other.

- **Where this is consumed.** [[def-limsup-liminf]] needs the supremum of a tail
  range of an arbitrary real sequence, which may be unbounded, and then the
  infimum of the resulting family, which may contain $+\infty$; both are supplied
  here and by nothing earlier in the library. Fourteen items on this page depend
  on it, and five more on the companion page of examples.

## Statement

Let $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ be a function, written $k \mapsto n_k$, and
recall that $n$ is **strictly increasing** when $n_j < n_k$ whenever $j < k$
([[def-sequence]], [[def-nat-order]]).

1. **Consecutive comparisons suffice.** If $n_i < n_{\sigma(i)}$ for every
   $i \in \mathbb{N}$, then $n$ is strictly increasing.
2. **Growth.** If $n$ is strictly increasing then $n_k \ge k$ for every
   $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

Claim 1 is what one checks in practice when exhibiting a subsequence; claim 2 is
what every later subsequence argument uses.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A function $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$, written $k \mapsto n_k$, with $\sigma$ the successor and the order of [[def-nat-order]]; claim 1 is proved under the standing assumption that $n_i < n_{\sigma(i)}$ for every $i$, and claim 2 under the standing assumption that $n$ is strictly increasing ([[def-sequence]]).

[A1] $Q(k)$ denotes the statement: $n_j < n_k$ for every $j < k$.

[A2] $P(k)$ denotes the statement: $n_k \ge k$.

[L1] Order and successor on $\mathbb{N}$: $m \le p$ means $m + i = p$ for some $i$, so $0 \le m$ for every $m$ because $0 + m = m$; and $\sigma(k) = k + 1$ with $\sigma(k) \ne k$, so $k < \sigma(k)$ ([[def-nat-order]], [[def-nat-addition]], [[lem-nat-add-identity]], [[lem-nat-successor-neq-self]]).

[L2] Discreteness: $m < p$ if and only if $\sigma(m) \le p$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]).

[L3] Induction principle: if $R(0)$ holds and $R(k)$ implies $R(\sigma(k))$ for every $k$, then $R(k)$ holds for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L4] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive and total, and satisfies trichotomy ([[thm-nat-linear-order]], [[lem-nat-trichotomy]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case for claim 1: $Q(0)$ holds vacuously, since no $j$ satisfies $j < 0$; indeed $0 \le j$ always holds, and $j < 0$ together with $0 \le j$ would contradict antisymmetry. [base, A1, L1, L4]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis for claim 1: fix $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume $Q(k)$, that is $n_j < n_k$ for every $j < k$. [ih, A1]

1.3 Base case for claim 2: $P(0)$ states $n_0 \ge 0$, which holds because $0 \le m$ for every natural $m$. [base, A2, L1]

1.4 Inductive hypothesis for claim 2: fix $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume $P(k)$, that is $k \le n_k$. [ih, A2]

2.1 Inductive step for claim 1: let $j < \sigma(k)$. By trichotomy either $k < j$, or $j = k$, or $j < k$. The case $k < j$ is impossible, since it gives $\sigma(k) \le j$ by [L2], which together with $j < \sigma(k)$ contradicts antisymmetry. If $j = k$ then $n_j = n_k < n_{\sigma(k)}$ by the standing assumption. If $j < k$ then $n_j < n_k$ by step 1.2 and $n_k < n_{\sigma(k)}$ by the standing assumption, so $n_j < n_{\sigma(k)}$ by transitivity. In every admissible case $n_j < n_{\sigma(k)}$, so $Q(\sigma(k))$ holds. [step 1.2, A1, L2, L4]

2.2 Inductive step for claim 2: $k < \sigma(k)$ by [L1], so strict increase gives $n_k < n_{\sigma(k)}$; combined with $k \le n_k$ from step 1.4 this yields $k < n_{\sigma(k)}$, hence $\sigma(k) \le n_{\sigma(k)}$ by [L2], which is $P(\sigma(k))$. [step 1.4, A2, L1, L2, L4]

3.1 Both inductions are complete, so by the induction principle $Q(k)$ holds for every $k$, which is claim 1, and $P(k)$ holds for every $k$, which is claim 2. [step 1.1, step 1.3, step 2.1, step 2.2, L3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Remarks

- Claim 2 is sharp: the identity map $n_k = k$ is strictly increasing with $n_k = k$ throughout, so no better bound than $n_k \ge k$ holds for all strictly increasing index maps.

- Claim 2 is exactly what makes a subsequence inherit a limit ([[lem-subsequence-inherits-limit]]): a threshold $K$ that works for the original sequence works unchanged for the subsequence, because $n_k \ge k \ge K$ whenever $k \ge K$.

- Nothing here is about $\mathbb{R}$; both claims are about $(\mathbb{N}, \le, \sigma)$ alone. Both are proved **by induction** ([L3]), and that is the method, not an order property. Claim 2 needs three order facts on top of the induction: that $0$ is least, which is what makes its base case $n_0 \ge 0$ true ([L1], step 1.3); discreteness ([[lem-nat-discrete]], [L2]), which upgrades $k < n_{\sigma(k)}$ to $\sigma(k) \le n_{\sigma(k)}$ (step 2.2); and transitivity in its mixed form, which composes $k \le n_k$ with $n_k < n_{\sigma(k)}$ into $k < n_{\sigma(k)}$ ([L4], step 2.2). Claim 1 additionally uses trichotomy and antisymmetry ([L4]).

- Of those three, neither the least element nor discreteness may be dropped. Discreteness alone is not enough: $(\mathbb{Z}, \le)$ is discrete in the same sense, $m < p$ iff $m + 1 \le p$, yet $k \mapsto k - 1$ is strictly increasing on $\mathbb{Z}$ with $n_k < k$ everywhere. What $\mathbb{Z}$ lacks is a least element to anchor the induction. A least element alone is not enough either, which is what fails over $\mathbb{Q}$: on the nonnegative rationals $x \mapsto x/2$ is strictly increasing and fixes the least element $0$, but $x/2 < x$ at every positive rational.

## Statement

For every sequence $(x_k)$ of reals ([[def-sequence]]),

$$\liminf_{k} x_k \;\le\; \limsup_{k} x_k$$

in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-limsup-liminf]], [[def-extended-reals]]). No
hypothesis is placed on $(x_k)$: both sides exist for every sequence
([[lem-limsup-exists]]) and the inequality holds between them in every case,
including those in which one or both sides are $\pm\infty$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals, its tail ranges $T_n = \{x_k : k \ge n\}$, and the extended tail bounds $s_n = \sup T_n$, $i_n = \inf T_n$ ([[def-limsup-liminf]]).

[L1] Every subset of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ has a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, an upper bound below every upper bound and a lower bound above every lower bound respectively ([[lem-extended-reals-complete]], [[def-upper-bound]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L2] Monotonicity of the tail bounds: $s_m \le s_n$ and $i_n \le i_m$ whenever $n \le m$, and $i_n \le s_n$ for every $n$; both $\limsup_k x_k = \inf\{s_n\}$ and $\liminf_k x_k = \sup\{i_n\}$ exist ([[lem-limsup-exists]], [[def-limsup-liminf]]).

[L3] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total ([[def-nat-order]], [[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

[L4] The order on $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is transitive ([[def-extended-reals]], [[def-partial-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ be arbitrary. The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total, so either $m \le n$ or $n \le m$; let $p$ be whichever of $m$ and $n$ is the larger, so that $m \le p$ and $n \le p$. [given, L3, choose]

2.1 Monotonicity of the tail bounds gives $i_m \le i_p$ and $s_p \le s_n$, and $i_p \le s_p$ holds because $T_p$ is nonempty; chaining these by transitivity yields $i_m \le s_n$. As $m$ and $n$ were arbitrary, every tail infimum is below every tail supremum. [step 1.1, L2, L4]

3.1 Fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$. By step 2.1 the element $s_n$ is an upper bound of the family $\{i_m : m \in \mathbb{N}\}$, and $\liminf_k x_k$ is its least upper bound, so $\liminf_k x_k \le s_n$. [step 2.1, L1, L2]

4.1 Since $n$ was arbitrary, $\liminf_k x_k$ is a lower bound of the family $\{s_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$, and $\limsup_k x_k$ is its greatest lower bound, so $\liminf_k x_k \le \limsup_k x_k$. [step 3.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Remarks

- **The inequality can be strict, and that is the interesting case.** For the
  alternating sequence the two sides are $-1$ and $1$
  ([[ex-limsup-of-alternating-sequence]]). Equality is exactly convergence, in the
  extended sense: that is [[thm-convergence-iff-limsup-equals-liminf]].

- **What the proof actually uses is that the two families interleave.** Each
  $i_m$ is below each $s_n$, not merely below $s_m$, and getting that needs a
  common index $p$ beyond both, which is where totality of the order on
  $\mathbb{N}$ enters. Without that step one would only know
  $i_n \le s_n$ for each $n$, which does not by itself compare a supremum of the
  first family with an infimum of the second.

- **No completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ is used here beyond what is already inside
  [[lem-extended-reals-complete]].** The argument is pure order theory in a
  totally ordered set with a least and a greatest element.

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ be sequences of reals ([[def-sequence]]) converging to
$x$ and $y$ respectively ([[def-real-limit]]). If $x_k \le y_k$ eventually, that
is for all $k$ from some index on, then

$$\lim_{k} x_k \;\le\; \lim_{k} y_k .$$

In particular, if $x_k \ge 0$ eventually then $\lim_k x_k \ge 0$, and if
$a \le x_k \le b$ eventually then $a \le \lim_k x_k \le b$.

The conclusion is **not** strict, and cannot be made strict; see the remarks
below and the false statement at the end of this page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $(x_k)$, $(y_k)$ of reals with $(x_k)$ converging to $x$, $(y_k)$ converging to $y$, and an index $K_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ with $x_k \le y_k$ for every $k \ge K_0$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]). Write $z_k := y_k - x_k$ and $z := y - x$.

[L1] Convergence, quantified over rational $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-real-limit]]).

[L2] Difference rule: $(z_k) = (y_k - x_k)$ converges to $y - x = z$ ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]]).

[L3] Small rationals: for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, by density ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) or by the Archimedean property ([[thm-of-archimedean]]) applied to $1/\eta$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

[L4] Absolute value: $|u| < c$ if and only if $-c < u < c$, for $c > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L5] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: adding a constant preserves $<$ and $\le$; $u \le v$ and $v < w$ give $u < w$; trichotomy, so exactly one of $z < 0$, $z = 0$, $z > 0$ holds and the negation of $z < 0$ is $z \ge 0$; $u \le v$ if and only if $v - u \ge 0$; and $u < u$ is impossible ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L6] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total, so any two indices admit a common upper bound ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

[L7] For $c \in \mathbb{R}$ the constant sequence $(c)$ converges to $c$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L8] A sequence of reals has at most one limit ([[lem-limit-unique]]), which is what licenses writing $\lim_k x_k$ and $\lim_k y_k$ for the limits named in the statement; without it those symbols would not denote.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 By [L2] the sequence $(z_k)$ converges to $z = y - x$, and by hypothesis $z_k = y_k - x_k \ge 0$ for every $k \ge K_0$. [given, L2, L5]

1.2 Suppose, for contradiction, that $z < 0$. [assume-contra]

2.1 Then $-z > 0$, so by [L3] we may choose a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < -z$. [step 1.2, L3, L5, choose]

3.1 Applying convergence of $(z_k)$ to this $\varepsilon$ gives $K_1 \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|z_k - z| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K_1$, hence $z_k - z < \varepsilon$ and so $z_k < z + \varepsilon$ for all such $k$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L1, L4, L5]

4.1 Fix an index $k$ with $k \ge K_0$ and $k \ge K_1$. Then $0 \le z_k < z + \varepsilon < z + (-z) = 0$, so $0 < 0$, which is impossible. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 3.1, L5, L6]

5.1 The assumption $z < 0$ is therefore untenable; by trichotomy $z \ge 0$, that is $y - x \ge 0$, that is $x \le y$; since $x$ and $y$ are the unique limits of $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ by [L8], that is exactly $\lim_k x_k \le \lim_k y_k$. Since $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ were an arbitrary pair satisfying the hypotheses, the conclusion applies to every such pair, and the two stated special cases are instances of it. Let $(w_k)$ be convergent. If $w_k \ge 0$ from some index on, apply the conclusion to the pair consisting of the constant sequence $0$, which converges to $0$ by [L7], and of $(w_k)$: it gives $0 \le \lim_k w_k$. If $a \le w_k \le b$ from some index on, apply it first to the constant sequence $a$ and $(w_k)$, then to $(w_k)$ and the constant sequence $b$: it gives $a \le \lim_k w_k$ and $\lim_k w_k \le b$. [step 4.1, L5, L7, L8, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- The two special cases are instances of the main claim, discharged in step 5.1 by taking one of the two sequences constant; that a constant sequence converges to its value ([[def-sequence]]) is the only extra ingredient they need.

- **The inequality does not become strict.** From $x_k < y_k$ for every $k$ one may conclude only $\lim x_k \le \lim y_k$; the witness $x_k = 0 < 1/(k+1) = y_k$ has equal limits ([[fs-limit-preserves-strict-inequality]]). Intuitively, the order relation $<$ is not preserved by passage to a limit because a strict gap may shrink to nothing, while $\le$ is preserved because it is closed under that shrinking.

- The proof routes through the single sequence $(z_k) = (y_k - x_k)$ and the difference rule of [[thm-algebra-of-limits]]. That is not an economy of writing only: it isolates the one thing being proved, namely that a sequence eventually $\ge 0$ cannot have a negative limit.

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]) and let $L \in \mathbb{R}$,
with *eventually* and *frequently* as in [[def-sequence]] and $\limsup$,
$\liminf$ as in [[def-limsup-liminf]].

1. $L = \limsup_{k} x_k$ **if and only if** for every real $\varepsilon > 0$
   $$x_k < L + \varepsilon \ \text{ eventually} \qquad \text{and} \qquad x_k > L - \varepsilon \ \text{ frequently}.$$
2. Dually, $L = \liminf_{k} x_k$ **if and only if** for every real
   $\varepsilon > 0$
   $$x_k > L - \varepsilon \ \text{ eventually} \qquad \text{and} \qquad x_k < L + \varepsilon \ \text{ frequently}.$$

**The hypothesis $L \in \mathbb{R}$ is not a restriction that can be lifted.**
Both conditions are stated with real $\varepsilon$ and real $L \pm \varepsilon$,
so neither has a reading at $L = \pm\infty$; the infinite cases are handled
instead by the convergence theorem later on this page. What the lemma does say
is that whenever $\limsup_k x_k$ happens to be a real number, it is pinned down by
the familiar two-sided test: nothing exceeds it by a fixed positive amount from
some index on, and something comes within any fixed positive amount of it
arbitrarily late.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals, a real number $L$, the tail ranges $T_n = \{x_k : k \ge n\}$, the extended tail suprema $s_n = \sup T_n$, and $\Lambda := \limsup_k x_k = \inf\{s_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ ([[def-limsup-liminf]]).

[L1] $\Lambda$ and every $s_n$ exist in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ for every sequence, and $\Lambda$ is the greatest lower bound of $\{s_n\}$ while $s_n$ is the least upper bound of $T_n$ ([[lem-extended-reals-complete]], [[lem-limsup-exists]], [[def-upper-bound]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L2] The order on $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is total, so the failure of $a \le b$ is $b < a$; it restricts on $\mathbb{R}$ to the order of $\mathbb{R}$; and every real number is $< +\infty$ and $> -\infty$ ([[def-extended-reals]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L3] A property $P$ of indices holds *eventually* when it holds for all $k \ge K$ for some $K$, and *frequently* when for every $K$ it holds for some $k \ge K$ ([[def-sequence]]).

[L4] Reciprocal Archimedean property: for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $m \ge 1$ with $1/m < \eta$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

[L5] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: for $\varepsilon > 0$ one has $L - \varepsilon < L < L + \varepsilon$, and $a < b$ if and only if $-b < -a$, both by translation invariance; the order is total, so exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds and $a < a$ is impossible ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L6] Reflection exchanges the two quantities: $\limsup_k(-x_k) = -\liminf_k x_k$ and $\liminf_k(-x_k) = -\limsup_k x_k$ ([[lem-limsup-reflection]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For the forward implication of claim 1, assume $L = \Lambda$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.2 For the converse implication of claim 1, assume that for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the sequence satisfies $x_k < L + \varepsilon$ eventually and $x_k > L - \varepsilon$ frequently. [assume-hyp, L3]

2.1 Under the assumption of step 1.1, $L + \varepsilon > L = \Lambda$, so $L + \varepsilon$ is not a lower bound of $\{s_n\}$, since $\Lambda$ is the greatest lower bound; by totality there is $n$ with $s_n < L + \varepsilon$. For every $k \ge n$ we have $x_k \le s_n$, hence $x_k < L + \varepsilon$; so $x_k < L + \varepsilon$ eventually. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L3, L5]

2.2 Under the assumption of step 1.1, fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Then $\Lambda \le s_n$ because $\Lambda$ is a lower bound of $\{s_n\}$, and $L - \varepsilon < L = \Lambda$, so $L - \varepsilon < s_n$. Hence $L - \varepsilon$ is not an upper bound of $T_n$, for an upper bound $u$ of $T_n$ satisfies $s_n \le u$; by totality of the order on $\mathbb{R}$ there is therefore $k \ge n$ with $x_k > L - \varepsilon$. As $n$ was arbitrary, $x_k > L - \varepsilon$ frequently. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L3, L5]

2.3 Under the assumption of step 1.2, let $\varepsilon > 0$ be a real and take $N$ with $x_k < L + \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge N$. Then $L + \varepsilon$ is an upper bound of $T_N$, so $s_N \le L + \varepsilon$ by leastness, and $\Lambda \le s_N$ because $\Lambda$ is a lower bound of $\{s_n\}$; hence $\Lambda \le L + \varepsilon$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L3]

2.4 Under the assumption of step 1.2, let $\varepsilon > 0$ be a real and fix $n$. There is $k \ge n$ with $x_k > L - \varepsilon$, and $x_k \le s_n$, so $L - \varepsilon < s_n$ and in particular $L - \varepsilon \le s_n$. As $n$ was arbitrary, $L - \varepsilon$ is a lower bound of $\{s_n\}$, so $L - \varepsilon \le \Lambda$ by greatest-lower-boundedness. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L3]

3.1 Taking $\varepsilon = 1$ in steps 2.3 and 2.4 gives $L - 1 \le \Lambda \le L + 1$ with $L \pm 1$ real, so $\Lambda$ is neither $+\infty$ nor $-\infty$ and is therefore a real number. Suppose $\Lambda > L$ and put $\delta := \Lambda - L > 0$; choosing a natural $m \ge 1$ with $1/m < \delta$ and applying step 2.3 with $\varepsilon = 1/m$ gives $\Lambda \le L + 1/m < L + \delta = \Lambda$, which is impossible. Suppose instead $\Lambda < L$ and put $\delta := L - \Lambda > 0$; choosing $m \ge 1$ with $1/m < \delta$ and applying step 2.4 with $\varepsilon = 1/m$ gives $L - 1/m \le \Lambda$, that is $\delta = L - \Lambda \le 1/m < \delta$, again impossible. By trichotomy $\Lambda = L$. [step 2.3, step 2.4, L2, L4, L5]

4.1 Steps 2.1 and 2.2 prove the forward implication of claim 1 and step 3.1 proves its converse, so claim 1 holds. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1]

5.1 For claim 2, note that $L = \liminf_k x_k$ holds exactly when $-L = -\liminf_k x_k = \limsup_k(-x_k)$, since negation is injective on $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$. Applying claim 1 to the sequence $(-x_k)$ and the real number $-L$, that holds exactly when for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ one has $-x_k < -L + \varepsilon$ eventually and $-x_k > -L - \varepsilon$ frequently. Negating each of the two inequalities reverses it, turning them into $x_k > L - \varepsilon$ eventually and $x_k < L + \varepsilon$ frequently, which is claim 2. [step 4.1, L5, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- **The two halves are not interchangeable.** "Eventually below $L + \varepsilon$"
  says $L$ is not exceeded in the long run; "frequently above $L - \varepsilon$"
  says $L$ is approached again and again. Weakening the first to *frequently*
  would make the condition hold for $L = \liminf$ as well, and strengthening the
  second to *eventually* would force convergence, which is exactly the extra
  content of [[thm-convergence-iff-limsup-equals-liminf]].

- **Real $\varepsilon$ is used throughout, and no rational test is involved.**
  Neither condition is a convergence statement, so [[def-real-limit]] and its
  quantification over rational $\varepsilon$ do not enter. Where a convergence
  hypothesis has to be fed into this lemma, as in
  [[thm-convergence-iff-limsup-equals-liminf]], the passage between rational and
  real $\varepsilon$ is made there, by the sanctioned remark of [[def-sequence]].

- **Why the epsilon lemmas for the real supremum are not cited.**
  [[lem-sup-epsilon]] and [[lem-inf-epsilon]] characterise the *real* supremum and
  infimum of a nonempty set bounded on the relevant side. Here $s_n$ may be
  $+\infty$ and the family $\{s_n\}$ may be unbounded below in $\mathbb{R}$, so
  neither lemma applies to the sets actually in play; the corresponding steps
  above are made directly from the least-upper-bound and greatest-lower-bound
  properties in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[lem-extended-reals-complete]]), which
  need no hypothesis.

- **The Archimedean property is what closes the converse.** Steps 2.3 and 2.4
  give $L - \varepsilon \le \Lambda \le L + \varepsilon$ for every positive real
  $\varepsilon$, and passing from that to $\Lambda = L$ needs a positive real
  strictly below any prescribed positive gap; [[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]]
  supplies $1/m$.

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]), with tail ranges $T_n$ and
extended tail bounds $s_n = \sup T_n$, $i_n = \inf T_n$ as in
[[def-limsup-liminf]].

1. **Monotonicity of the extended bounds under inclusion.** If
   $A \subseteq B \subseteq \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-extended-reals]]) then
   $$\sup A \le \sup B \qquad \text{and} \qquad \inf B \le \inf A,$$
   the four quantities being the extended bounds of [[lem-extended-reals-complete]].
   No hypothesis is placed on $A$ or $B$; in particular $A$ may be empty.
2. **The tail bounds are monotone.** $T_m \subseteq T_n$ whenever $n \le m$, and
   hence
   $$s_m \le s_n \qquad \text{and} \qquad i_n \le i_m \qquad (n \le m).$$
   In particular $s_{n+1} \le s_n$ and $i_n \le i_{n+1}$ for every $n$, and
   $i_n \le s_n$ for every $n$.
3. **Existence.** $\limsup_k x_k$ and $\liminf_k x_k$ exist in
   $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ for **every** sequence of reals, bounded or not.

Claim 1 is the tool the rest of this page uses whenever two extended suprema are
compared. It is proved here, from the definition of a least upper bound, rather
than quoted from the suprema page, for the reason given in the remarks below.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals, its tail ranges $T_n = \{x_k : k \ge n\}$, and the extended bounds $s_n = \sup T_n$, $i_n = \inf T_n$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-limsup-liminf]]).

[L1] Every subset of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ has a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, with no hypothesis on the subset ([[lem-extended-reals-complete]]).

[L2] Least upper bound and greatest lower bound in a poset: $\sup A$ is an upper bound of $A$ that is $\le$ every upper bound of $A$, and $\inf A$ is a lower bound that is $\ge$ every lower bound; each is unique when it exists ([[def-upper-bound]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L3] $(\overline{\mathbb{R}}, \le)$ is a totally ordered set, so its order is reflexive and transitive ([[def-extended-reals]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L4] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total and transitive ([[def-nat-order]], [[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $A \subseteq B \subseteq \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ be arbitrary. By [L1] the four elements $\sup A$, $\sup B$, $\inf A$, $\inf B$ of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ all exist and are uniquely determined. [given, L1, L2]

1.2 Let $n \le m$ in $\mathbb{N}$. Every element of $T_m$ has the form $x_k$ with $k \ge m$, and then $k \ge n$ by transitivity, so $x_k \in T_n$; hence $T_m \subseteq T_n$. [given, L4]

1.3 For every $n$ the tail range $T_n$ contains $x_n$, so $i_n \le x_n$ because $i_n$ is a lower bound of $T_n$, and $x_n \le s_n$ because $s_n$ is an upper bound of $T_n$; transitivity gives $i_n \le s_n$. [given, L1, L2, L3]

2.1 Since $\sup B$ is an upper bound of $B$ and $A \subseteq B$, every element of $A$ is $\le \sup B$, so $\sup B$ is an upper bound of $A$; as $\sup A$ is the least of the upper bounds of $A$, this gives $\sup A \le \sup B$. Dually $\inf B$ is a lower bound of $B$, hence of $A$, and as $\inf A$ is the greatest of the lower bounds of $A$ this gives $\inf B \le \inf A$. Claim 1 is proved. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

3.1 Applying claim 1 to the inclusion $T_m \subseteq T_n$ valid for $n \le m$ gives $s_m \le s_n$ and $i_n \le i_m$; the special case $m = n + 1$ gives $s_{n+1} \le s_n$ and $i_n \le i_{n+1}$. Together with $i_n \le s_n$ this is claim 2. [step 1.2, step 1.3, step 2.1]

4.1 The families $\{s_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ and $\{i_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ are subsets of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, so [L1] applies to them with no hypothesis, and $\limsup_k x_k = \inf\{s_n\}$ and $\liminf_k x_k = \sup\{i_n\}$ exist in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ for every sequence of reals. This is claim 3. [step 3.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Remarks

- **The monotonicity is where the two operations of the definition interlock.**
  Because $(s_n)$ is nonincreasing, the outer infimum in
  $\limsup_k x_k = \inf_n s_n$ is an infimum of a decreasing family, so it is the
  value the tail suprema are pressing down towards; and because $(i_n)$ is
  nondecreasing, $\liminf_k x_k = \sup_n i_n$ is the value the tail infima are
  pressing up towards. Nothing in this lemma says the pressing converges, and for
  an unbounded sequence there is nothing in $\mathbb{R}$ for it to converge to;
  the exact statement is [[lem-limsup-epsilon-characterisation]].

- **Why the word "nonincreasing" is spelled out rather than cited.**
  [[def-monotone-sequence]] defines monotone for sequences of *reals*, and
  $(s_n)$ takes values in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, so the definition does not
  apply to it. Claim 2 is therefore stated as the inequality it is. When $(x_k)$
  is bounded every $s_n$ is real ([[def-limsup-liminf]]) and $(s_n)$ is then a
  nonincreasing sequence of reals in the sense of [[def-monotone-sequence]], but
  no proof on this page needs that reading.

- **Claim 1 is not [[lem-sup-monotone]].** That lemma is the same one-line
  argument carried out in $\mathbb{R}$, and its statement carries the hypotheses
  that the smaller set be nonempty and the larger one bounded above, without
  which neither supremum denotes anything. Those are exactly the hypotheses that
  the extended bounds of [[lem-extended-reals-complete]] dispense with, so the
  extended statement is not an instance of the real one and is proved from the
  definition of a least upper bound instead.

- **Claim 1 costs nothing and is used everywhere.** It is the one-line poset
  argument: the larger set's supremum bounds the smaller set, and leastness does
  the rest. It is stated as part of this lemma rather than as an item of its own
  because it is used only in company with the tail bounds.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$, with
$|x|$ the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]). Then

$$|x| \ge 0; \quad |x| = 0 \iff x = 0; \quad -|x| \le x \le |x|; \quad |-x| = |x|; \quad |xy| = |x|\,|y|;$$

and, for every $c > 0$, one has $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and elements $x, y \in F$.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| = u$ if $u \ge 0$, and $|u| = -u$ if $u < 0$ ([[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Ordered-field order: trichotomy holds (for each $u$ exactly one of $u > 0$, $u = 0$, $u < 0$), $a < b$ means $b - a$ is positive, and sums and products of positives are positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Signs in products: $(-a)b = -(ab)$ and $(-a)(-b) = ab$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] Sign rules: a product of two elements of the same sign is positive, and a product of two elements of opposite sign is negative ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Case $x > 0$: by [L1] $|x| = x > 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; since $-x < 0$ we get $|-x| = -(-x) = x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -x < 0 < x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case pos, L1, L2, algebra]

1.2 Case $x = 0$: then $|x| = |0| = 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ holds with $|x| = 0$ and $x = 0$, while $|-x| = |0| = |x|$ and $-|x| = 0 \le 0 \le 0 = |x|$. [assume-case zero, L1]

1.3 Case $x < 0$: by [L1] $|x| = -x$, and [L2] gives $-x > 0$, so $|x| > 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; here $|-x| = -x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -(-x) = x \le x$ while $x < 0 < -x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case neg, L1, L2, algebra]

1.4 Case $x = 0$ or $y = 0$: then $xy = 0$, so $|xy| = 0$, and one of $|x|, |y|$ is $0$, whence $|x|\,|y| = 0 = |xy|$. [assume-case zerofactor, L1]

1.5 Case $x, y$ have the same sign (both positive or both negative): by [L4] $xy > 0$, so $|xy| = xy$, while $|x|\,|y| = xy$ by [L3] (for $x, y < 0$ this is $(-x)(-y) = xy$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case same, L1, L3, L4]

1.6 Case $x, y$ have opposite signs (one positive, one negative): by [L4] $xy < 0$, so $|xy| = -(xy)$, while $|x|\,|y| = -(xy)$ by [L3] (namely $x(-y)$ or $(-x)y$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case opposite, L1, L3, L4]

2.1 By trichotomy [L2] each $x$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.1-1.3, and in each we verified $|x| \ge 0$, that $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$, that $|-x| = |x|$, and that $-|x| \le x \le |x|$; hence all four hold for every $x$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, cases-exhaustive]

2.2 By trichotomy [L2] each pair $x, y$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.4-1.6, and in each $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$ for all $x, y$. [step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6, cases-exhaustive]

3.1 Let $c > 0$: if $|x| < c$ then $-c < -|x| \le x \le |x| < c$ by [step 2.1] and [L2], so $-c < x < c$; conversely if $-c < x < c$ then both $x < c$ and $-x < c$, and since $|x|$ equals $x$ or $-x$ by [L1], we get $|x| < c$, so $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$. [step 2.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b \in F$.

1. If $a > 0$ then $a^{-1} > 0$.
2. If $0 < a < b$ then $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b \in F$.

[L1] $x > 0 \iff x \in P$; $x < 0 \iff -x \in P$; and for $x \neq 0$ exactly one of $x \in P$, $-x \in P$ holds ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Sign rules: a product of a positive and a negative is negative, a product of two positives is positive, and for $c > 0$ one has $a < b \iff ac < bc$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

[L3] $0 < 1$; in particular $1 \neq 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L4] $P$ is closed under addition, so $<$ is transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a > 0$, so $a \neq 0$ and its inverse $a^{-1}$ exists with $a \cdot a^{-1} = 1$; moreover $a^{-1} \neq 0$, since $a^{-1}$ has $a$ as its inverse while $0$ is non-invertible ($1 \neq 0$ by L3). [assume-hyp, L1, L3]

2.1 By trichotomy $a^{-1} \in P$ or $-a^{-1} \in P$; if $-a^{-1} \in P$, then $a > 0$ and $a^{-1} < 0$ give $a \cdot a^{-1} < 0$ by the sign rules, i.e. $1 < 0$, contradicting $0 < 1$; hence $a^{-1} \in P$, i.e. $a^{-1} > 0$, proving claim 1. [step 1.1, L2, L3, L1]

3.1 Assume $0 < a < b$; then $0 < b$ by transitivity, so by claim 1 both $a^{-1} > 0$ and $b^{-1} > 0$, and the sign rules give $a^{-1} b^{-1} > 0$. [assume-hyp, step 2.1, L4, L2, L1]

4.1 Multiplying $a < b$ by the positive $a^{-1} b^{-1}$ via the sign rules gives $a (a^{-1} b^{-1}) < b (a^{-1} b^{-1})$; since $a a^{-1} = 1$ and $b b^{-1} = 1$, this simplifies to $b^{-1} < a^{-1}$. [step 3.1, L2, algebra]

5.1 Together with $b^{-1} > 0$ from step 3.1, we conclude $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$, proving claim 2. [step 3.1, step 4.1] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field, with field structure as in [[def-field]], and for
$n \ge 1$ let $n \cdot 1_F$ denote the canonical natural number
$\underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$, defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$
and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$. Then for every $n \ge 1$:

- $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$;
- the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$;
- $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ and $(mn) \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F)$ for all $m, n \ge 1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ whose canonical naturals are defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, with $0 \cdot 1_F = 0$.

[L1] $0 < 1_F$ in every ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] The order is compatible with addition and positives are closed under addition: $a < b$ implies $a + c < b + c$, and $a > 0$, $b > 0$ imply $a + b > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 1$: by definition $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, and $1_F > 0$. [L1, base]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: assume $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for some fixed $n \ge 1$. [ih]

1.3 By the recursion, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F - n \cdot 1_F = 1_F > 0$, so $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$. [given, L1]

1.4 Additive identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ by the recursion, and if $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ then $(m+n+1) \cdot 1_F = (m+n) \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + (n+1) \cdot 1_F$. [given, algebra]

2.1 Inductive step: $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ is a sum of two positives, by the hypothesis and $1_F > 0$, hence $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Iterating 1.3, for $m < n$ one has $m \cdot 1_F < n \cdot 1_F$, so $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing and therefore injective on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$. [step 1.3, L2]

2.3 Multiplicative identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m \cdot 1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(1 \cdot 1_F)$, and the step $(m(n+1)) \cdot 1_F = (mn + m) \cdot 1_F = (mn) \cdot 1_F + m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F) + (m \cdot 1_F)(1_F) = (m \cdot 1_F)((n+1) \cdot 1_F)$ uses 1.4 and distributivity. [step 1.4, algebra]

3.1 By induction on 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for every $n \ge 1$; with the strict increase 2.2 and the identities 1.4, 2.3, every claim holds. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 1.4, step 2.3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Every sequence of reals has a monotone subsequence: for every sequence $(x_k)$ of
reals ([[def-sequence]]) there is a strictly increasing
$n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that the subsequence $(x_{n_j})$ is monotone
([[def-monotone-sequence]]).

No hypothesis whatever is placed on $(x_k)$: it need not be bounded, and it need
not converge. Combined with the corollary later on this page, which
converts monotone plus bounded into convergent, this is the whole content of the
Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem.

Call an index $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a **peak** of $(x_k)$ when

$$x_m \le x_n \quad \text{for every } m \ge n,$$

that is, when no later term ever exceeds $x_n$. The proof splits on whether peaks
occur arbitrarily late or stop occurring, and produces a nonincreasing
subsequence in the first case and an increasing one in the second. The picture
behind the name is the rising sun shining from the right: the peaks are the
points that are not put in shadow by anything to their right.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals. An index $n \in \mathbb{N}$ is called a *peak* when $x_m \le x_n$ for every $m \ge n$, and $P \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ denotes the set of peaks.

[L1] Recursion theorem: for a set $A$, an element $a \in A$ and a function $f : A \to A$ there is a unique $g : \mathbb{N} \to A$ with $g_0 = a$ and $g_{\sigma(j)} = f(g_j)$ ([[thm-recursion]]).

[L2] Well-ordering principle: every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L3] Consecutive comparisons suffice for an index map: if $n_j < n_{\sigma(j)}$ for every $j$ then $n$ is strictly increasing ([[lem-index-map-grows]]).

[L4] Consecutive comparisons suffice for monotonicity: if $y_{\sigma(j)} \le y_j$ for every $j$ then $(y_j)$ is nonincreasing, and if $y_j < y_{\sigma(j)}$ for every $j$ then $(y_j)$ is increasing; in both cases $(y_j)$ is monotone ([[def-monotone-sequence]]).

[L5] Subsequences: for strictly increasing $n$, the composite $(x_{n_j})$ is a subsequence of $(x_k)$ and is again a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]).

[L6] Order on $\mathbb{N}$: $m < n$ means $m \le n$ and $m \ne n$; the order is total and transitive ([[def-nat-order]], [[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

[L7] Discreteness: $N < \sigma(N)$ for every $N \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]).

[L8] Trichotomy in $\mathbb{R}$: for reals $s, t$ exactly one of $s < t$, $s = t$, $s > t$ holds, so the failure of $x_m \le x_n$ is $x_m > x_n$, and $x_n > x_n$ is impossible ([[def-real-order]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 **Case (i).** Assume that for every $N \in \mathbb{N}$ there is a peak $n$ with $n > N$. [given, assume-case cofinal]

1.2 **Case (ii).** Assume instead that there is $N_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that no $n > N_0$ is a peak. [given, assume-case bounded]

2.1 In case (i) the set $P$ is nonempty, since the case hypothesis applied to $N = 0$ produces a peak, so $P$ has a least element $p_0$. [step 1.1, L2, choose]

2.2 In case (i), for each $p \in P$ the set $\{q \in P : q > p\}$ is nonempty, by the case hypothesis applied to $N = p$; let $f(p)$ be its least element. This defines $f : P \to P$ with $f(p) > p$ for every $p \in P$. [step 1.1, L2, construct]

2.3 In case (ii) put $A := \{n \in \mathbb{N} : n > N_0\}$; it is nonempty because $\sigma(N_0) > N_0$. [step 1.2, L7]

3.1 In case (i), the recursion theorem applied to the set $P$, the element $p_0$ and the function $f$ gives $g : \mathbb{N} \to P$ with $g_0 = p_0$ and $g_{\sigma(j)} = f(g_j)$; every $g_j$ is a peak and $g_j < g_{\sigma(j)}$ for every $j$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L1]

3.2 In case (ii), each $n \in A$ satisfies $n > N_0$ and so is not a peak, meaning some $m \ge n$ has $x_m > x_n$; such an $m$ is distinct from $n$, since $x_n > x_n$ is impossible, hence $m > n > N_0$ and $m \in A$. The set of such $m$ is therefore a nonempty subset of $A$; let $h(n)$ be its least element. This defines $h : A \to A$ with $h(n) > n$ and $x_{h(n)} > x_n$. [step 2.3, L2, L6, L8, construct]

4.1 In case (i), $g$ is strictly increasing by [L3], so $(x_{g_j})$ is a subsequence of $(x_k)$. [step 3.1, L3, L5]

4.2 In case (i), for every $j$ the index $g_{\sigma(j)}$ satisfies $g_{\sigma(j)} \ge g_j$ and $g_j$ is a peak, so $x_{g_{\sigma(j)}} \le x_{g_j}$; hence $(x_{g_j})$ is nonincreasing, so monotone. [step 3.1, L4]

4.3 In case (ii), the recursion theorem applied to the set $A$, the element $\sigma(N_0)$ and the function $h$ gives $g' : \mathbb{N} \to A$ with $g'_0 = \sigma(N_0)$ and $g'_{\sigma(j)} = h(g'_j)$; thus $g'_j < g'_{\sigma(j)}$ and $x_{g'_j} < x_{g'_{\sigma(j)}}$ for every $j$. [step 2.3, step 3.2, L1]

5.1 In case (ii), $g'$ is strictly increasing by [L3], so $(x_{g'_j})$ is a subsequence of $(x_k)$, and it is increasing by [L4], so monotone. [step 4.3, L3, L4, L5]

6.1 Cases (i) and (ii) are literal negations of one another, so one of them holds; case (i) produces the monotone subsequence $(x_{g_j})$ and case (ii) the monotone subsequence $(x_{g'_j})$. Every sequence of reals therefore has a monotone subsequence. [step 4.1, step 4.2, step 5.1, cases: exhaustive by negation, cases-exhaustive] ∎

## Remarks

- **The two cases are a negation pair, so no completeness is used to split them.**
  Either peaks occur beyond every index, or they stop; nothing about $\mathbb{R}$
  enters the dichotomy. The only properties of the reals used anywhere above are
  trichotomy of the order, in step 3.2, and nothing else. In particular this
  lemma holds verbatim in any linearly ordered set, and it is
  [[cor-monotone-converges-iff-bounded]], not this lemma, that consumes the
  least-upper-bound property inside [[thm-bolzano-weierstrass]].

- **Which kind of monotone subsequence is produced depends on the case, and the
  statement deliberately does not say which.** Case (i) gives a nonincreasing
  subsequence and case (ii) a strictly increasing one. A sequence may satisfy
  case (i) with no increasing subsequence at all, for instance a constant
  sequence, so nothing stronger than "monotone" can be claimed uniformly.

- **Choice is not used.** Both recursions choose a *least* element, supplied by
  the well-ordering principle ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]), so the functions
  $f$ and $h$ are defined outright rather than selected, and
  [[thm-recursion]] then produces the index map. This is why the lemma, and with
  it Bolzano-Weierstrass in $\mathbb{R}$, needs no form of the axiom of choice,
  in contrast with the usual argument for sequential compactness in a general
  metric space.

## Statement

The map $q \mapsto \hat q$ ([[def-real-numbers]]) is an embedding of ordered
fields. Every real is approximated by rationals: for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and
rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ with
$|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$. Consequently, strictly between any two
reals lies a rational.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real $x = [(a_n)]$ and a rational $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] The orders of $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}$; ordered-field arithmetic ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Field arithmetic in $\mathbb{Q}$: $\varepsilon/2, \delta/4$ are positive rationals, and every nonzero rational $q$ has a reciprocal $1/q$ with $q \cdot (1/q) = 1$ ([[thm-rat-field]]).

[L3] Cauchy definition ([[def-rational-cauchy-sequence]]).

[L4] Real positivity via eventual rational lower bounds ([[def-real-order]]).

[L5] $\mathbb{R} = \mathcal{C}/\mathcal{N}$ is a field ([[thm-reals-field]]), and $0_{\mathbb{R}} = \hat 0$, $1_{\mathbb{R}} = \hat 1$ are the classes of the constant sequences ([[def-real-numbers]]). A multiplicative inverse there is unique: if $ab = 1_{\mathbb{R}} = ac$ then $b = b(ac) = (ba)c = c$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Embedding: constant sequences are Cauchy; $\hat q = \hat r$ iff the constant $q - r$ is null iff $q = r$; operations match termwise; and $q < r$ gives the constant lower bound $r - q > 0$, so $\hat q < \hat r$ and order is preserved and reflected. [L1, L4]

1.2 Fix $N$ with $|a_m - a_n| < \varepsilon/2$ for all $m, n \ge N$, and set $q = a_N$. [L3, L2]

2.1 The difference $\hat q - x$ has representative $(a_N - a_n)$ with $|a_N - a_n| < \varepsilon/2$ for $n \ge N$; hence both $\hat\varepsilon - (x - \hat q)$ and $\hat\varepsilon - (\hat q - x)$ have representatives eventually $> \varepsilon/2$, so both are positive: $|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$. [step 1.2, L4, L1]

2.2 Inverses: let $q$ be a nonzero rational. Then $\hat q \ne \hat 0 = 0_{\mathbb{R}}$ by the injectivity of step 1.1, and $1/q$ exists in $\mathbb{Q}$ by [L2]; since the operations match termwise (step 1.1), $\hat q \cdot \widehat{1/q} = \widehat{q \cdot (1/q)} = \hat 1 = 1_{\mathbb{R}}$. Inverses in $\mathbb{R}$ are unique by [L5], so $(\hat q)^{-1} = \widehat{1/q}$: the embedding preserves reciprocals. [step 1.1, L2, L5]

3.1 Density: let $x < y$; pick $\delta > 0$ rational and $N$ with the representative of $y - x$ eventually $> \delta$; set $\varepsilon = \delta/4$ and pick $q$ with $|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$; then $q' = q + 2\varepsilon$ satisfies $\hat q' - x \ge -\hat\varepsilon + 2\hat\varepsilon = \hat\varepsilon > 0$ and $y - \hat q' \ge \hat\delta - \hat\varepsilon - 2\hat\varepsilon = \hat\delta/4 > 0$, so $x < \hat q' < y$. [step 2.1, L4, L1, L2]

4.1 The rationals embed as an ordered subfield — injectively, preserving the order in both directions, the ring operations, and reciprocals — and they approximate every real arbitrarily well and separate any two reals. [step 1.1, step 2.2, step 3.1] ∎

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]), with $\limsup$ and
$\liminf$ as in [[def-limsup-liminf]].

1. For $L \in \mathbb{R}$: $(x_k)$ converges to $L$ ([[def-real-limit]]) **if and
   only if** $\liminf_k x_k = \limsup_k x_k = L$.
2. $x_k \to +\infty$ ([[def-divergence-to-infinity]]) **if and only if**
   $\liminf_k x_k = \limsup_k x_k = +\infty$. Moreover $\liminf_k x_k = +\infty$
   on its own already forces $\limsup_k x_k = +\infty$.
3. $x_k \to -\infty$ **if and only if** $\liminf_k x_k = \limsup_k x_k = -\infty$,
   and $\limsup_k x_k = -\infty$ on its own already forces
   $\liminf_k x_k = -\infty$.

The three clauses combine into one statement about the extended line: for
$L \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$, the sequence $(x_k)$ converges to $L$ in
$\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-extended-limits]]) if and only if

$$\liminf_{k} x_k = \limsup_{k} x_k = L .$$

Since $\liminf_k x_k \le \limsup_k x_k$ always ([[lem-liminf-le-limsup]]), the
single equation $\liminf_k x_k = \limsup_k x_k$ is therefore equivalent to
convergence in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, and the common value is the limit. A
sequence that neither converges nor diverges to $\pm\infty$ is exactly one for
which the inequality is strict.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals, its tail ranges $T_n = \{x_k : k \ge n\}$, the extended tail bounds $s_n = \sup T_n$ and $i_n = \inf T_n$, and the quantities $\limsup_k x_k = \inf\{s_n\}$, $\liminf_k x_k = \sup\{i_n\}$ ([[def-limsup-liminf]]).

[L1] All of $s_n$, $i_n$, $\limsup_k x_k$ and $\liminf_k x_k$ exist in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ for every sequence; $i_n$ is the greatest lower bound of $T_n$ and $\liminf_k x_k$ the least upper bound of $\{i_n\}$, with the dual descriptions for $s_n$ and $\limsup_k x_k$ ([[lem-limsup-exists]], [[lem-extended-reals-complete]], [[def-upper-bound]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L2] The order on $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is total, so the failure of $a \le b$ is $b < a$; it restricts on $\mathbb{R}$ to the order of $\mathbb{R}$; $+\infty$ is the greatest element and $-\infty$ the least; and every real is $< +\infty$ and $> -\infty$ ([[def-extended-reals]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L3] Epsilon characterisation, for a real $L$: $L = \limsup_k x_k$ exactly when for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ one has $x_k < L + \varepsilon$ eventually and $x_k > L - \varepsilon$ frequently; and $L = \liminf_k x_k$ exactly when for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ one has $x_k > L - \varepsilon$ eventually and $x_k < L + \varepsilon$ frequently ([[lem-limsup-epsilon-characterisation]]).

[L4] $\liminf_k x_k \le \limsup_k x_k$ ([[lem-liminf-le-limsup]]).

[L5] Reflection: $\limsup_k(-x_k) = -\liminf_k x_k$ and $\liminf_k(-x_k) = -\limsup_k x_k$ ([[lem-limsup-reflection]]). Also $x_k \to -\infty$ if and only if $-x_k \to +\infty$: the condition $x_k < M$ for all $k \ge K$ is equivalent to $-x_k > -M$ for all $k \ge K$ by order reversal, and $M$ runs over all reals exactly when $-M$ does ([[def-divergence-to-infinity]]); the order reversal used here is strict, and the form stated in [[lem-of-add-order]] is likewise strict, so nothing nonstrict is being borrowed from it.

[L6] Convergence to a real $L$ means: for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with $|x_k - L| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$; and the same relation is obtained by testing every real $\varepsilon > 0$ instead, since below any positive real lies a positive rational ([[def-real-limit]], [[def-sequence]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L7] Divergence: $x_k \to +\infty$ means that for every real $M$ there is $K$ with $x_k > M$ for all $k \ge K$ ([[def-divergence-to-infinity]]).

[L8] Eventually and frequently, and the fact that a property holding eventually holds frequently, since indices beyond any two given thresholds exist by totality of the order on $\mathbb{N}$; likewise two properties each holding eventually hold together from the larger threshold on ([[def-sequence]], [[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

[L9] Absolute value: for $c > 0$, $|a| < c$ if and only if $-c < a < c$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L10] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: $0 < 1$, so $t < t + 1$ for every real $t$, and no real is above every real; adding a constant preserves the order ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For the forward implication of claim 1, assume $L \in \mathbb{R}$ and that $(x_k)$ converges to $L$. [assume-hyp, L6]

1.2 For the converse implication of claim 1, assume $L \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\liminf_k x_k = \limsup_k x_k = L$. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.3 For the forward implication of claim 2, assume $x_k \to +\infty$. [assume-hyp, L7]

1.4 For the converse implication of claim 2, assume $\liminf_k x_k = +\infty$. [assume-hyp, L1]

2.1 Under the assumption of step 1.1, let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real. Testing convergence at $\varepsilon$ gives $K$ with $|x_k - L| < \varepsilon$, hence $L - \varepsilon < x_k < L + \varepsilon$, for all $k \ge K$. So $x_k < L + \varepsilon$ eventually and $x_k > L - \varepsilon$ eventually, and each of the two therefore also holds frequently. Both halves of each characterisation in [L3] are met, so $\limsup_k x_k = L$ and $\liminf_k x_k = L$. [step 1.1, L3, L6, L8, L9]

2.2 Under the assumption of step 1.2, let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real. The forward halves of the two characterisations in [L3] give $x_k < L + \varepsilon$ for all $k$ beyond some $K_1$ and $x_k > L - \varepsilon$ for all $k$ beyond some $K_2$; beyond the larger of $K_1$ and $K_2$ both hold, so $|x_k - L| < \varepsilon$ there. This holds for every real $\varepsilon > 0$, in particular for every rational one, so $(x_k)$ converges to $L$. [step 1.2, L3, L6, L8, L9]

2.3 Under the assumption of step 1.3, let $M$ be an arbitrary real and take $K$ with $x_k > M$ for all $k \ge K$. Then $M$ is a lower bound of $T_K$, so $M \le i_K$, and $i_K \le \liminf_k x_k$ because $\liminf_k x_k$ is an upper bound of $\{i_n\}$; hence $M \le \liminf_k x_k$. Since $M$ was an arbitrary real, $\liminf_k x_k$ is not $-\infty$, which lies below every real, and it is not a real $t$ either, since $M = t + 1$ would give $t + 1 \le t$. So $\liminf_k x_k = +\infty$. [step 1.3, L1, L2, L7, L10]

2.4 Under the assumption of step 1.4, let $M$ be an arbitrary real. Since $\sup\{i_n\} = +\infty$ and $M < +\infty$, the real $M$ is not an upper bound of $\{i_n\}$, for otherwise the least upper bound would satisfy $+\infty \le M$; by totality there is $n$ with $i_n > M$. Every $k \ge n$ satisfies $x_k \ge i_n > M$, so $x_k > M$ eventually. As $M$ was arbitrary, $x_k \to +\infty$. [step 1.4, L1, L2, L7]

3.1 Steps 2.1 and 2.2 are the two implications of claim 1. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L3]

3.2 For claim 2: if $x_k \to +\infty$ then $\liminf_k x_k = +\infty$ by step 2.3, and then $+\infty = \liminf_k x_k \le \limsup_k x_k$ forces $\limsup_k x_k = +\infty$ since $+\infty$ is the greatest element; conversely if $\liminf_k x_k = \limsup_k x_k = +\infty$ then in particular $\liminf_k x_k = +\infty$ and step 2.4 gives $x_k \to +\infty$. The same use of [L4] is the additional assertion that $\liminf_k x_k = +\infty$ alone forces $\limsup_k x_k = +\infty$. [step 2.3, step 2.4, L2, L4]

4.1 For claim 3, reflection gives $x_k \to -\infty$ exactly when $-x_k \to +\infty$, which by claim 2 holds exactly when $\liminf_k(-x_k) = \limsup_k(-x_k) = +\infty$, that is $-\limsup_k x_k = -\liminf_k x_k = +\infty$, that is $\limsup_k x_k = \liminf_k x_k = -\infty$; and $\limsup_k x_k = -\infty$ alone forces $\liminf_k x_k \le -\infty$, hence $\liminf_k x_k = -\infty$, since $-\infty$ is least. Claims 1, 2 and 3 together say that for $L \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ the sequence converges to $L$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ exactly when $\liminf_k x_k = \limsup_k x_k = L$, since the three clauses of that definition are convergence to a real $L$, divergence to $+\infty$ and divergence to $-\infty$. [step 3.1, step 3.2, L2, L4, L5] ∎

## Remarks

- **This is the theorem that makes $\limsup$ and $\liminf$ worth defining.** They
  exist for every sequence, with no hypothesis, and their coincidence is exactly
  convergence in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$. So a question about convergence becomes
  a question about two computable quantities, and a proof of convergence can be
  assembled from one-sided estimates without a candidate limit in hand.

- **The equation is between elements of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, and reading it in
  $\mathbb{R}$ would lose two thirds of the content.** Clauses 2 and 3 are
  statements about divergence, and they are true statements about
  [[def-divergence-to-infinity]], not a redefinition of it: nothing above claims
  that a sequence diverging to $+\infty$ has a limit in $\mathbb{R}$, and the
  symbol $+\infty$ occurring in them is the element of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$
  introduced in [[def-extended-reals]].

- **A sequence with $\liminf < \limsup$ does neither.** The alternating sequence
  is the standard witness, with the two values $-1$ and $1$
  ([[ex-limsup-of-alternating-sequence]]); it is bounded, so it also does not
  diverge to $\pm\infty$, and the theorem says its failure to converge is exactly
  the gap between the two quantities.

## Statement

The relation $\le$ on $\mathbb{N}$, where $m \le n \iff \exists k\ (m + k = n)$ ([[def-nat-order]]), is a linear (total) order: reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive, and total.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The order $m \le n \iff \exists k\ (m + k = n)$ ([[def-nat-order]]) and addition with $m + 0 = m$, $m + \sigma(n) = \sigma(m + n)$ ([[def-nat-addition]]).

[L1] $0 + k = k$ and addition is associative ([[lem-nat-add-identity]], [[lem-nat-add-associative]]).

[L2] Cancellation: $m + k = n + k \Rightarrow m = n$ ([[lem-nat-add-cancellative]]).

[L3] Every nonzero natural is a successor: if $j \ne 0$ then $j = \sigma(i)$ for some $i$ ([[lem-nat-nonzero-is-successor]]).

[L4] Trichotomy: exactly one of $m < n$, $m = n$, $m > n$ holds ([[lem-nat-trichotomy]]).

[L5] Addition is commutative ([[lem-nat-add-commutative]]).

[L6] $\sigma(x) \ne 0$ for every $x$ (Peano axiom P1) ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Reflexive: $m + 0 = m$, so $m \le m$. [given]

1.2 Transitive: if $m \le n$ and $n \le p$, say $m + k = n$ and $n + j = p$, then $m + (k + j) = (m + k) + j = n + j = p$, so $m \le p$. [given, L1]

1.3 A sum is zero only if both summands are: if $k + j = 0$ with $j \ne 0$ then $j = \sigma(i)$ and $k + j = k + \sigma(i) = \sigma(k + i) \ne 0$ [L6], a contradiction, so $k = j = 0$. [L1, L3, L6]

1.4 Total: by trichotomy one of $m < n$, $m = n$, $m > n$ holds, and each of these gives $m \le n$ or $n \le m$. [L4]

2.1 Antisymmetric: if $m \le n$ and $n \le m$, say $m + k = n$ and $n + j = m$, then $m + (k + j) = (m + k) + j = n + j = m = m + 0$; commuting both sides [L5] gives $(k + j) + m = 0 + m$, and cancelling the common right summand $m$ [L2] gives $k + j = 0$, hence $k = j = 0$ by step 1.3 and $m = n$. [given, L1, L2, L5, step 1.3]

3.1 Reflexivity, antisymmetry, transitivity, and totality all hold, so $\le$ is a linear order on $\mathbb{N}$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.1, step 1.4] ∎

## Statement

Every complete ordered field $F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) is Archimedean:
for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$,
where $n \cdot 1_F$ is the canonical natural of the ordered field $F$
([[def-ordered-field]]). Equivalently, the canonical naturals are cofinal in $F$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $F$; write $A = \{\, n \cdot 1_F : n \ge 1 \,\}$ for the set of its canonical naturals.

[L1] Least-upper-bound property: every nonempty $S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound $\sup S \in F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Each canonical natural satisfies $n \cdot 1_F > 0$, one has $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L3] $0 < 1_F$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $F$ is not Archimedean: there is some $x \in F$ with $n \cdot 1_F \le x$ for all $n \ge 1$, that is, $x$ is an upper bound of $A$. [assume-contra]

2.1 The set $A$ is nonempty, since $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F \in A$, and it is bounded above by $x$. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 By the least-upper-bound property, $A$ has a least upper bound $s = \sup A \in F$. [step 2.1, L1]

4.1 Since $1_F > 0$, we have $s - 1_F < s$; as $s$ is the least upper bound, $s - 1_F$ is not an upper bound of $A$. [step 3.1, L3]

5.1 Hence there is some $m \ge 1$ with $m \cdot 1_F > s - 1_F$. [step 4.1]

6.1 Adding $1_F$ to both sides, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F > s$. [step 5.1, L2]

7.1 But $(m+1) \cdot 1_F \in A$, so $(m+1) \cdot 1_F \le s$ because $s$ is an upper bound of $A$, contradicting 6.1. [step 6.1, step 3.1, L2]

8.1 The assumption is therefore untenable, so $F$ is Archimedean. [step 7.1, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Statement

Let $(N,0,\sigma)$ be a Peano system ([[def-peano-system]]), in particular the natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]). For any set $A$, any element $a \in A$, and any function $f : A \to A$, there is a unique function $g : N \to A$ such that $g(0) = a$ and $g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n))$ for all $n \in N$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** a Peano system $(N,0,\sigma)$, a set $A$, an element $a \in A$, and a function $f : A \to A$. Call a set $R \subseteq N \times A$ **closed** when $(0,a) \in R$ and, for all $n \in N$ and $x \in A$, $(n,x) \in R$ implies $(\sigma(n),f(x)) \in R$.

[L1] Induction holds in $N$: any $S \subseteq N$ with $0 \in S$ that is closed under $\sigma$ equals $N$ (axiom P3, [[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L2] In a Peano system $\sigma(n) \ne 0$ (P1) and $\sigma$ is injective (P2) ([[def-peano-system]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The set $N \times A$ is closed, so the collection of closed subsets of $N \times A$ is nonempty; let $g := \bigcap \{ R : R \subseteq N \times A \text{ closed} \}$, which is itself closed, since if every closed $R$ contains $(0,a)$ then so does $g$, and if $(n,x) \in g$ then $(n,x) \in R$ for each closed $R$, whence $(\sigma(n),f(x)) \in R$ for each such $R$, so $(\sigma(n),f(x)) \in g$. [given, construct]

2.1 Let $D = \{ n \in N : \exists x \in A,\ (n,x) \in g \}$; then $0 \in D$ since $(0,a) \in g$, and if $n \in D$ with $(n,x) \in g$ then $(\sigma(n),f(x)) \in g$ by closure, so $\sigma(n) \in D$; by induction $D = N$, hence $g$ relates every $n$ to at least one $x$. [L1, step 1.1]

2.2 Suppose $(0,b) \in g$ with $b \ne a$; then $g \setminus \{(0,b)\}$ still contains $(0,a)$ and is closed, since any generated pair $(\sigma(m),f(z))$ has $\sigma(m) \ne 0$ by P1 and so is never equal to $(0,b)$; this contradicts the minimality of $g$, so $a$ is the unique second coordinate paired with $0$. [L2, step 1.1]

3.1 Let $U = \{ n \in N : \text{there is exactly one } x \text{ with } (n,x) \in g \}$; then $0 \in U$ by step 2.2. [step 2.2]

4.1 Assume $n \in U$ with unique value $x$, so $(n,x) \in g$ and $(\sigma(n),f(x)) \in g$ by closure; if $(\sigma(n),c) \in g$ with $c \ne f(x)$, then $g \setminus \{(\sigma(n),c)\}$ contains $(0,a)$ because $\sigma(n) \ne 0$, and is closed, because a generated pair $(\sigma(m),f(z))$ with $(m,z) \in g \setminus \{(\sigma(n),c)\}$ can equal $(\sigma(n),c)$ only if $\sigma(m) = \sigma(n)$ and $f(z) = c$, but $\sigma(m) = \sigma(n)$ forces $m = n$ by injectivity, then $z = x$ by uniqueness at $n$, giving $f(z) = f(x) \ne c$, a contradiction; hence $g \setminus \{(\sigma(n),c)\}$ is closed and smaller than $g$, contradicting minimality, so $f(x)$ is the unique value at $\sigma(n)$ and $\sigma(n) \in U$. [L2, step 3.1, step 1.1]

5.1 By induction $U = N$, so together with the totality from step 2.1 the relation $g$ is a function $g : N \to A$; it satisfies $g(0) = a$, and closure with uniqueness gives $g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n))$ for all $n$. [L1, step 2.1, step 3.1, step 4.1]

6.1 If $h : N \to A$ also satisfies $h(0) = a$ and $h(\sigma(n)) = f(h(n))$, then the set $\{ n : g(n) = h(n) \}$ contains $0$ and is closed under $\sigma$, since $g(n) = h(n)$ implies $g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n)) = f(h(n)) = h(\sigma(n))$, so by induction it equals $N$, that is $h = g$. [L1, step 5.1] ∎

## Statement

Every nonempty subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ has a least element: there is $\ell \in S$ with $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A nonempty subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. Define $T = \{\, n \in \mathbb{N} : \text{every } m \text{ with } m \le n \text{ satisfies } m \notin S \,\}$ (informally, no element of $S$ is $\le n$).

[L1] Induction principle: a subset of $\mathbb{N}$ that contains $0$ and is closed under $\sigma$ equals $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L2] $m < n \iff \sigma(m) \le n$; consequently no $k$ satisfies $n < k < \sigma(n)$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]).

[L3] Exactly one of $s < n$, $s = n$, $n < s$ holds ([[lem-nat-trichotomy]]); and $n < s \iff \sigma(n) \le s$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]).

[L4] $\sigma$ is injective (Peano axiom P2) ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]).

[L5] $\sigma(a) + i = \sigma(a + i)$ for all $a, i$ (the left successor law, [[lem-nat-add-successor-left]]).

[L6] $0 + k = k$ for all $k$ ([[lem-nat-add-identity]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose $S$ is nonempty but has no least element. [assume-contra]

1.2 If $m < \sigma(n)$ then $m \le n$: by [L2] applied to $m$ and $\sigma(n)$ we get $\sigma(m) \le \sigma(n)$, say $\sigma(m) + i = \sigma(n)$; then $\sigma(m + i) = \sigma(m) + i = \sigma(n)$ [L5], so $m + i = n$ by injectivity [L4], hence $m \le n$. [L2, L4, L5]

2.1 First, $0 \in T$: if $0 \in S$ then $0 \le s$ for all $s \in S$, since $0 + s = s$ [L6], making $0$ a least element, contrary to the assumption; hence $0 \notin S$; moreover $m \le 0$ forces $m = 0$, because $m \ne 0$ would give $0 < m$ (as $0 + m = m$ [L6] with $m \ne 0$) while $m \le 0$ gives $m < 0$, and [L3] admits at most one of these; so every $m \le 0$ lies outside $S$. [step 1.1, L3, L6, given]

2.2 Next, $T$ is closed under $\sigma$: assume $n \in T$; if $\sigma(n) \in S$ then no $s \in S$ satisfies $s < \sigma(n)$ (else $s \le n$ by step 1.2, so $s \notin S$ because $n \in T$, a contradiction), hence $\sigma(n) \le s$ for all $s \in S$ by [L3], making $\sigma(n)$ a least element, contrary to the assumption; therefore $\sigma(n) \notin S$, and any $m$ with $m \le \sigma(n)$ satisfies $m = \sigma(n)$ or $m \ne \sigma(n)$; in the second case $m \le \sigma(n)$ together with $m \ne \sigma(n)$ gives $m < \sigma(n)$ by the definition of the strict order, hence $m \le n$ by step 1.2 and $m \notin S$ because $n \in T$, while in the first case $m = \sigma(n) \notin S$; so every $m \le \sigma(n)$ lies outside $S$, giving $\sigma(n) \in T$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L3]

3.1 By the induction principle [L1], from $0 \in T$ and closure under $\sigma$, $T = \mathbb{N}$; then for every $n$, taking $m = n \le n$ shows $n \notin S$, so $S = \varnothing$, contradicting nonemptiness; therefore $S$ has a least element. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L1, discharge-contradiction] ∎
