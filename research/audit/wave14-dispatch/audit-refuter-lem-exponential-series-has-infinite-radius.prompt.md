You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as
an independent adversarial proof-refuter. Return evidence only; Audit-Alpha
alone adjudicates and edits.

## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` Statement or consumer, actively search for a
counterexample or a failure in the witness or cited generated premise. A false
public claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or
materially inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is
nonfatal.

Return no more than 450 words, exactly in this shape:

  location: [exact section/fact/step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal

## Statement

For every real $x$, the series $\sum_{n\ge0}x^n/\iota(n!)$ converges absolutely. Its power-series radius is therefore $+\infty$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real $x$.

[L1] Archimedes supplies a natural larger than any prescribed real ([[thm-of-archimedean]]).

[L2] A tail bounded termwise by a convergent geometric series converges ([[thm-direct-comparison-test]], [[thm-geometric-series]]), and absolute convergence implies convergence ([[lem-absolute-convergence-implies-convergence]]).

[L3] Factorials satisfy $(n+1)!=n!(n+1)$ and are nonzero naturals; every positive natural has a positive, hence nonzero, canonical real image ([[def-factorial-and-falling-factorial]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 If $x=0$, the series is $1+0+0+\cdots$ and converges absolutely. Hence assume $x\ne0$. Choose $N\ge1$ with $\iota(N)>2|x|$. For $n\ge N$, the absolute terms $a_n=|x|^n/\iota(n!)$ are positive and satisfy $a_{n+1}/a_n=|x|/\iota(n+1)<1/2$.  [L1, L3, choose]

2.1 Thus $a_{N+j}\le a_N2^{-j}$ by induction, and the tail is dominated by a convergent geometric series.  [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 The zero case from step 1.1 and, when $x\ne0$, adding the finite initial segment to the convergent tail prove absolute convergence for arbitrary $x$. Hence every nonnegative radius works and the radius is $+\infty$.  [step 1.1, step 2.1, L2] ∎

## Definition

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]) with additive identity $0_F$ and
multiplicative identity $1_F$. Define
$\iota : \mathbb{N} \to F$ by recursion on $\mathbb{N}$
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[thm-recursion]]):

$$\iota(0) \;:=\; 0_F, \qquad \iota(n+1) \;:=\; \iota(n) + 1_F .$$

$\iota(n)$ is the **canonical natural** of $n$ in $F$. It is also written
$n \cdot 1_F$, and for $n \ge 1$ it is $1_F$ added to itself $n$ times.

**Why the notation is needed at all.** A natural number in this library is a von
Neumann natural, that is a set ([[def-natural-numbers]]), and a set is not an
element of $F$. So $1/n$, $n^{\alpha}$ and $x/n$ are not expressions of $F$ when
$n$ is a natural: what they mean is $1/\iota(n)$, $\iota(n)^{\alpha}$ and
$x/\iota(n)$. The map $\iota$ is what carries a counting number into the field,
and writing it is the whole reason a reader meets $1/\iota(k+1)$ where an
informal text would write $1/(k+1)$.

## Remarks

- **Where the index shift comes from.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
  ([[def-natural-numbers]]) and $\iota(0) = 0_F$, so $1/\iota(k)$ is undefined at
  $k = 0$. A family of reciprocals indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ is therefore written
  over $\iota(k+1)$, which is why the harmonic and telescoping families of this
  library run over $k+1$ rather than over $k$. This is bookkeeping, not a
  restriction: the values are the usual ones.

- **This definition records notation; the arithmetic is proved elsewhere.** That
  $\iota$ is strictly increasing and positive on $n \ge 1$, and that it carries
  sums to sums and products to products, is [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], stated
  for an ordered field. That lemma introduces the same element by the equivalent
  recursion $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, which
  agrees with the definition above because $\iota(1) = \iota(0) + 1_F = 1_F$.
  Nothing here is new mathematics; the definition exists so that the notation has
  a home a reader can look up.

- **The symbol $\iota$ is used in this library for other canonical maps, and this
  definition does not govern them.** It also denotes the canonical field
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to F$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), the isometric
  embedding of a metric space into a completion ([[def-metric-completion]]), and
  an inclusion map $\iota : S \to X$ of a subspace. Each of those is introduced
  where it is used and means something different from the map defined here. What
  the four share is only that each is the canonical map of its situation.

- **Fields, not just ordered fields.** The recursion needs no order, so the
  definition is stated for a field; every use in this library is in an ordered
  field, and the order is what makes $\iota$ injective
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). In a field of positive characteristic $\iota$
  is not injective, which is one reason the injectivity is a lemma rather than
  part of the definition.

## Definition

**The factorial.** By the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) applied to the
set $\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$, the starting element $(0,1)$ and the function
$f(k, v) = (\sigma(k),\, v \cdot \sigma(k))$, and by the same induction on the
first coordinate as in [[def-nat-finite-sum-and-product]], there is a unique
$F : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ with

$$F(0) = 1, \qquad F(\sigma(n)) = F(n)\cdot\sigma(n) \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

We write $n! := F(n)$. Thus $0! = 1$, $1! = 0!\cdot 1 = 1$, $2! = 1!\cdot 2 = 2$,
$3! = 6$, $4! = 24$, $5! = 120$, $6! = 720$.

**$0! = 1$ is the base clause of this recursion**, not a convention imported from
elsewhere. Nothing about empty products is presupposed; the agreement with the
empty product is proved below, in clause (a), rather than assumed.

**Truncated difference.** Throughout, $n - k$ is the operation fixed in
[[def-nat-finite-sum-and-product]]: the unique $j$ with $k + j = n$ when
$k \le n$, and $0$ when $n < k$.

**The falling factorial.** For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ define $n^{\underline{k}}$ by
recursion on $k$, by the recursion theorem applied to
$\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ with starting element $(0,1)$ and
$f(k, v) = (\sigma(k),\, v \cdot (n-k))$:

$$n^{\underline{0}} = 1, \qquad n^{\underline{\sigma(k)}} = n^{\underline{k}}\cdot(n-k) .$$

So $n^{\underline{1}} = 1\cdot(n-0) = n$ and $n^{\underline{2}} = n\,(n-1)$, and
for $k \le n$ the value is the product $n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1)$ of the $k$ topmost
factors.

**Four facts, proved here because the page uses each of them.**

**(a) The factorial is the product of the first $n$ positive naturals.**
$n! = \prod_{j<n}\sigma(j) = \prod_{j<n}(j+1)$, the $\mathbb{N}$-valued product of
[[def-nat-finite-sum-and-product]]. Induction ([[thm-induction-principle]]): at
$n = 0$ both sides are $1$, the empty product and the base clause agreeing; and
$\prod_{j<\sigma(n)}\sigma(j) = \big(\prod_{j<n}\sigma(j)\big)\cdot\sigma(n) = n!\cdot\sigma(n) = \sigma(n)!$.
**So the empty-product reading and the base-clause reading are the same reading**,
and neither was assumed.

**(b) $n! \ne 0$, and $\iota(n!) = \prod^{\mathbb{R}}_{j<n}\iota(j+1)$.** For the
first, $0! = 1 \ne 0$ ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]) and
$\sigma(n)! = n!\cdot\sigma(n)$ is a product of two nonzero naturals, which is
nonzero: if $xy = 0$ with $y \ne 0$ then $xy = 0\cdot y$
([[lem-nat-mult-identity]]) and cancellation gives $x = 0$
([[lem-nat-mult-cancellative]]). So $n! \ne 0$ for every $n$ by induction. For the second, apply the bridge clause
6 of that lemma to clause (a) above. This is what makes the factorial of this
page and the real-valued product $\prod_{j<n}(j+1)$ used elsewhere in the library
**one object seen twice**, rather than two unrelated notions.

**(c) $n^{\underline{k}}\cdot(n-k)! = n!$ for $k \le n$.** Induction on $k$, for
all $n$ at once. At $k = 0$ this reads $1 \cdot n! = n!$. Assume it at $k$ and
let $\sigma(k) \le n$; then $k \le n$, and writing $d := n - k$ we have
$k + d = n$ and $d \ne 0$, since $k + 0 = k \ne n$; so $d = \sigma(e)$ for a
unique $e$ ([[lem-nat-nonzero-is-successor]]), and $\sigma(k) + e = n$, that is
$e = n - \sigma(k)$ ([[lem-nat-add-cancellative]]). Therefore
$n^{\underline{\sigma(k)}}\cdot\big(n-\sigma(k)\big)! = n^{\underline{k}}\cdot(n-k)\cdot e! = n^{\underline{k}}\cdot\big(e!\cdot\sigma(e)\big) = n^{\underline{k}}\cdot\sigma(e)! = n^{\underline{k}}\cdot(n-k)! = n!$,
using commutativity and associativity of multiplication
([[lem-nat-mult-associative]], [[lem-nat-mult-commutative]]) and the recursion
clause for the factorial.

**(d) Boundary values.** $n^{\underline{0}} = 1$ for every $n$, by the base
clause; $n^{\underline{n}} = n!$, since clause (c) at $k = n$ gives
$n^{\underline{n}}\cdot 0! = n!$ and $0! = 1$; and
$n^{\underline{k}} = 0$ whenever $k > n$. For the last, $n - n = 0$ gives
$n^{\underline{\sigma(n)}} = n^{\underline{n}}\cdot 0 = 0$, the clause
$x \cdot 0 = 0$ being definitional ([[def-nat-multiplication]]), and if
$n^{\underline{k}} = 0$ then
$n^{\underline{\sigma(k)}} = 0$ as well, so $n^{\underline{k}} = 0$ for every
$k \ge \sigma(n)$ by induction.

## Remarks

- **Why $0! = 1$ is not imported.** The empty-product convention of an arbitrary
  monoid is fixed in [[def-monoid-finite-product]], which comes later in the
  reading order, so citing it here would be a dependency pointing the wrong way.
  Taking $0! = 1$ as the base clause of the factorial's own recursion costs
  nothing and owes nothing, and clause (a) then records the agreement.

- **The library's other factorial.** [[lem-factorial-beats-geometric]], later in
  the reading order, works with a real-valued factorial defined as the product
  $\prod_{j<n}(j+1)$ in $\mathbb{R}$. Clause (b) says that this is exactly
  $\iota(n!)$, so the two agree and no second notion has been created. That
  pointer is orientation only.

- **Check every clause at $k = 0$ and at $k = n$.** The falling factorial is
  defined by two regimes, one for $k \le n$ and one beyond, and the recursion
  above covers both because the truncated difference is $0$ past the end. The
  two values that get used constantly are $n^{\underline{0}} = 1$ and
  $n^{\underline{n}} = n!$, and both are clause (d).

## Definition

For $x\in\mathbb R$, define
$$\exp(x):=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^n}{\iota(n!)}, \qquad e:=\exp(1),$$
provided by the all-real convergence proved in [[lem-exponential-series-has-infinite-radius]]. Here $n!\in\mathbb N$ is the factorial of [[def-factorial-and-falling-factorial]], $\iota(n!)$ is its nonzero real image ([[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]), and powers and series are those of [[def-integer-power]] and [[def-series]].

This is a real power series centred at $0$ ([[def-real-power-series-and-radius-of-convergence]]). No logarithm, irrational power, or differential equation enters the definition.

## Statement

Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals. If the series $\sum |a_k|$ converges
([[def-series]]) then the series $\sum a_k$ converges.

A series with the property that $\sum |a_k|$ converges is called **absolutely
convergent**; the lemma says that absolute convergence implies convergence.

The same statement holds for a family from a general starting index $m$, being
this statement applied to the shifted sequence $j \mapsto a_{j+m}$
([[def-series]]).

**The converse is false**, and the standard witness is the alternating harmonic
series. That witness is not available on this page: its convergence is the
alternating series test, which is not proved here. Nothing below asserts a
converse, and no item on this page uses one.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(a_k)$ of reals such that the series $\sum |a_k|$ converges, with partial sums as in [[def-series]] and finite sums as in [[def-finite-sum]].

[L1] The Cauchy criterion for series: $\sum d_k$ converges if and only if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $N \in \mathbb{N}$ with $\big|\sum_{k=p+1}^{n} d_k\big| < \varepsilon$ for all $n > p \ge N$ ([[thm-series-cauchy-criterion]], [[def-series]]).

[L2] Triangle inequality for finite sums: $\big|\sum_{k<d} u_k\big| \le \sum_{k<d}|u_k|$ ([[lem-triangle-inequality-finite]]); the block $\sum_{k=p+1}^{n} u_k$ is by definition the finite sum $\sum_{t < n-p} u_{p+1+t}$ ([[def-finite-sum]]), so applying the inequality to the shifted sequence $t \mapsto u_{p+1+t}$ gives $\big|\sum_{k=p+1}^{n} u_k\big| \le \sum_{k=p+1}^{n} |u_k|$ for all naturals $n > p$.

[L3] Monotonicity of finite sums: if $x_t \ge 0$ for all $t < d$ then $\sum_{t<d} x_t \ge 0$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L4] Absolute value: $|u| \ge 0$ for every real $u$, and $|u| = u$ whenever $u \ge 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L5] Convergence of a real sequence, and the fact that the real and rational formulations of a tolerance agree ([[def-real-limit]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real; since $\sum |a_k|$ converges, the Cauchy criterion applied to the sequence $(|a_k|)$ supplies $N \in \mathbb{N}$ with $\big|\sum_{k=p+1}^{n} |a_k|\big| < \varepsilon$ for all $n > p \ge N$. [L1, L5, choose]

1.2 For all naturals $n > p$ the block $\sum_{k=p+1}^{n} |a_k|$ is a finite sum of nonnegative terms, hence nonnegative, hence equal to its own absolute value. [L2, L3, L4]

2.1 So for all $n > p \ge N$ one has $\big|\sum_{k=p+1}^{n} a_k\big| \le \sum_{k=p+1}^{n} |a_k| = \big|\sum_{k=p+1}^{n} |a_k|\big| < \varepsilon$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L2]

3.1 As $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary, the sequence $(a_k)$ satisfies the Cauchy criterion, so $\sum a_k$ converges. [step 2.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Nothing here identifies the two sums**, and they are in general different. What is proved is that the second series converges, not that it converges to the same value; the bound $\big|\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k\big| \le \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}|a_k|$ is true and is not needed anywhere on this page, so it is not proved here.

- **Why the Cauchy criterion is the right instrument.** The terms have no sign, so [[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]] does not apply to $\sum a_k$ and boundedness of its partial sums would prove nothing. The Cauchy criterion is the one convergence test on this page that never names a candidate sum and never asks for a sign, and the whole proof is the observation that its hypothesis for $(|a_k|)$ implies its hypothesis for $(a_k)$, term by term, through one application of the finite triangle inequality.

- **What this unlocks on this page.** The root test ([[thm-root-test]]) and the ratio test ([[thm-ratio-test]]) each produce convergence of $\sum |a_k|$ directly, by comparison with a geometric series; with this lemma both reach their standard conclusion, the convergence of $\sum a_k$ itself. Without it their convergence halves would be strictly weaker than the classical statements.

- **The systematic theory is elsewhere.** Rearrangement, the Riemann series theorem, conditional convergence and products of series all belong with absolute convergence and are developed on a later page of this track. This lemma is only the one implication those two tests need.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field, with field structure as in [[def-field]], and for
$n \ge 1$ let $n \cdot 1_F$ denote the canonical natural number
$\underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$, defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$
and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$. Then for every $n \ge 1$:

- $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$;
- the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$;
- $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ and $(mn) \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F)$ for all $m, n \ge 1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ whose canonical naturals are defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, with $0 \cdot 1_F = 0$.

[L1] $0 < 1_F$ in every ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] The order is compatible with addition and positives are closed under addition: $a < b$ implies $a + c < b + c$, and $a > 0$, $b > 0$ imply $a + b > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 1$: by definition $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, and $1_F > 0$. [L1, base]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: assume $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for some fixed $n \ge 1$. [ih]

1.3 By the recursion, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F - n \cdot 1_F = 1_F > 0$, so $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$. [given, L1]

1.4 Additive identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ by the recursion, and if $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ then $(m+n+1) \cdot 1_F = (m+n) \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + (n+1) \cdot 1_F$. [given, algebra]

2.1 Inductive step: $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ is a sum of two positives, by the hypothesis and $1_F > 0$, hence $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Iterating 1.3, for $m < n$ one has $m \cdot 1_F < n \cdot 1_F$, so $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing and therefore injective on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$. [step 1.3, L2]

2.3 Multiplicative identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m \cdot 1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(1 \cdot 1_F)$, and the step $(m(n+1)) \cdot 1_F = (mn + m) \cdot 1_F = (mn) \cdot 1_F + m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F) + (m \cdot 1_F)(1_F) = (m \cdot 1_F)((n+1) \cdot 1_F)$ uses 1.4 and distributivity. [step 1.4, algebra]

3.1 By induction on 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for every $n \ge 1$; with the strict increase 2.2 and the identities 1.4, 2.3, every claim holds. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 1.4, step 2.3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ be sequences of reals and suppose there is
$K \in \mathbb{N}$ with

$$0 \;\le\; a_k \;\le\; b_k \qquad \text{for all } k \ge K .$$

Then:

1. if $\sum b_k$ converges then $\sum a_k$ converges ([[def-series]]);
2. if $\sum a_k$ diverges then $\sum b_k$ diverges.

The same statement holds verbatim for series with a general starting index $m$,
applied to the shifted sequences of [[def-series]].

The hypothesis is on the terms from some index on, not on all of them: finitely
many terms of either sequence may violate it, or be negative, without affecting
the conclusion. What may not be dropped is nonnegativity of $(a_k)$ from that
index on.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $(a_k)$, $(b_k)$ of reals and $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $0 \le a_k \le b_k$ for all $k \ge K$; the partial sums $\alpha_j = \sum_{i<j} a_{K+i}$ and $\beta_j = \sum_{i<j} b_{K+i}$ of the $K$-th tail series ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[L1] Monotonicity of finite sums: if $x_i \le y_i$ for all $i < j$ then $\sum_{i<j} x_i \le \sum_{i<j} y_i$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L2] A series converges if and only if its $K$-th tail series converges ([[lem-series-tail-invariance]]).

[L3] For a series of nonnegative terms: it converges if and only if the range of its partial sums is bounded above, and in the convergent case every partial sum is at most the sum ([[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For every $i \in \mathbb{N}$ the index $K + i$ is at least $K$, so $0 \le a_{K+i} \le b_{K+i}$; in particular both tail series have nonnegative terms. [given]

1.2 Assume $\sum b_k$ converges. Then its $K$-th tail series $\sum_{k \ge K} b_k$ converges. [given, L2]

2.1 By monotonicity of finite sums, $\alpha_j \le \beta_j$ for every $j \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 1.1, L1]

2.2 That tail series has nonnegative terms, so its partial sums satisfy $\beta_j \le B$ for every $j$, where $B$ is its sum. [step 1.2, step 1.1, L3]

3.1 Hence $\alpha_j \le \beta_j \le B$ for every $j$, so the range of $(\alpha_j)$ is bounded above by $B$. [step 2.1, step 2.2]

4.1 The tail series $\sum_{k \ge K} a_k$ has nonnegative terms and partial sums bounded above, so it converges. [step 3.1, step 1.1, L3]

5.1 Therefore $\sum a_k$ converges, which is claim 1. [step 4.1, L2]

6.1 Claim 2 is the contrapositive of claim 1: if $\sum a_k$ diverges then $\sum b_k$ cannot converge. [step 5.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Both nonnegativity hypotheses are used, and in different places.** $a_k \ge 0$ is what lets convergence of $\sum_{k \ge K} a_k$ be read off from boundedness of its partial sums, and $b_k \ge a_k \ge 0$ is what makes the sum of $\sum_{k \ge K} b_k$ an upper bound for the partial sums $\beta_j$. Drop the sign hypothesis and the theorem is false, not merely unproved; the companion page exhibits a pair with $a_k \le b_k$ for every $k$, $\sum b_k$ convergent and $\sum a_k$ divergent.

- **The comparison is with a series, not with a limit.** No quotient $a_k/b_k$ appears and no $b_k$ is required to be nonzero, which is what distinguishes this test from the limit comparison test proved next.

## Statement

Let $r \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $r^k$ be the integer power ([[def-integer-power]]),
so that $r^0 = 1$ for every $r$, including $r = 0$.

1. If $|r| < 1$ then the series $\sum r^k$ converges ([[def-series]]) and
   $$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} r^{k} \;=\; \frac{1}{1-r} .$$
2. If $|r| \ge 1$ then $\sum r^k$ diverges.

The series starts at $k = 0$ and its first term is $r^0 = 1$; in particular
$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} 2^{-k} = 2$, while the series starting at $k = 1$ sums to
$1$. Which starting index is meant has to be said, and it is said here.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real number $r$, the integer powers $r^k$ ([[def-integer-power]]), and the partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} r^k$ of $\sum r^k$ ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[L1] Factorisation of a difference of powers: for $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and natural $n \ge 1$, $b^n - a^n = (b-a)\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a^k b^{\,n-1-k}$ ([[lem-power-difference-factorisation]]).

[L2] For $|r| < 1$ the sequence $(r^k)$ is null, that is $r^k \to 0$ ([[lem-geometric-sequence-null]]).

[L3] Algebra of limits: sums, differences and quotients of convergent sequences converge to the corresponding combination, the quotient rule requiring a nonzero limit and nonzero denominators ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L4] Absolute value: $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$, $|x| \ge 0$, and $|x| = 0$ exactly when $x = 0$; also $|1| = 1$, since $1 > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L5] Powers and order: $a^0 = 1$ for every $a$; if $a \ge 1$ and $n \ge 1$ then $a^n \ge a \ge 1$; and $1^n = 1$ for every $n$ ([[lem-power-monotone]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L6] The principle of induction ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L7] If a series converges then its terms tend to $0$ ([[lem-nth-term-test]]).

[L8] Notation of [[def-finite-sum]]: $\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x_k$ is $\sum_{k<n} x_k$, and the empty sum $\sum_{k<0} x_k$ is $0$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Assume $|r| < 1$. [assume-case lt]

1.2 Assume instead $|r| \ge 1$. [assume-case ge]

1.3 For every natural $n \ge 1$, applying [L1] with $b = 1$ and $a = r$ gives $1 - r^n = (1-r)\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} r^k \cdot 1^{\,n-1-k} = (1-r)\,s_n$, using $1^m = 1$ and the notation of [L8]. [L1, L5, L8]

1.4 At $n = 0$ the identity $1 - r^n = (1-r)s_n$ also holds, both sides being $0$ because $r^0 = 1$ and $s_0$ is the empty sum. [L5, L8]

2.1 In the case $|r| < 1$ we have $r \ne 1$, since $|1| = 1$ and $|r| < 1$; hence $1 - r \ne 0$. [step 1.1, L4, algebra]

2.2 In the case $|r| \ge 1$, an induction gives $|r^k| = |r|^k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$: at $k = 0$ both sides are $1$, and if $|r^k| = |r|^k$ then $|r^{k+1}| = |r^k \cdot r| = |r^k|\,|r| = |r|^k |r| = |r|^{k+1}$. [step 1.2, L4, L5, L6]

2.3 In the case $|r| \ge 1$ we get $|r|^k \ge 1$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$: at $k = 0$ this reads $1 \ge 1$, and for $k \ge 1$ it is the comparison $|r|^k \ge |r| \ge 1$. [step 1.2, L5]

3.1 In the case $|r| < 1$, dividing by $1 - r \ne 0$ gives $s_n = (1 - r^n)/(1-r)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.1, step 1.3, step 1.4, algebra]

3.2 In the case $|r| \ge 1$, combining the two previous steps gives $|r^k - 0| = |r^k| = |r|^k \ge 1$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.2, step 2.3]

4.1 In the case $|r| < 1$ the sequence $(r^n)$ is null, so $1 - r^n \to 1$ and therefore $s_n \to 1/(1-r)$, the denominator being the nonzero constant $1-r$; hence $\sum r^k$ converges with sum $1/(1-r)$, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 3.1, step 2.1, L2, L3]

4.2 In the case $|r| \ge 1$ the sequence $(r^k)$ does not converge to $0$, since the rational tolerance $\varepsilon = 1$ admits no index $K$ with $|r^k - 0| < 1$ for all $k \ge K$; so by the term test $\sum r^k$ diverges, which is claim 2. [step 3.2, L7]

5.1 The two cases $|r| < 1$ and $|r| \ge 1$ exhaust the possibilities, since the order on $\mathbb{R}$ is total, so claims 1 and 2 together cover every real $r$. [step 4.1, step 4.2, cases-exhaustive] ∎

## Remarks

- **The divergence half needs no separate treatment of $r = 1$ and $r = -1$.** Both are covered by $|r| \ge 1$, and the single reason is the same in every case: the terms have absolute value at least $1$, so they cannot tend to $0$. For $r = 1$ the partial sums are $s_n = n$ and run to $+\infty$; for $r = -1$ they oscillate between $0$ and $1$. The theorem says only that neither converges, which is all that "diverges" means here ([[def-series]]).

- **Why the identity is proved at $n = 0$ separately.** [[lem-power-difference-factorisation]] requires $n \ge 1$, since its right-hand side is a sum over $k < n$ of a term involving $b^{\,n-1-k}$, and $n-1$ is not a natural number at $n = 0$. The identity is still true at $n = 0$, but by inspection of two empty objects rather than by that lemma, and step 1.4 says so rather than letting the reader assume the citation covers it.

## Statement

Every complete ordered field $F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) is Archimedean:
for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$,
where $n \cdot 1_F$ is the canonical natural of the ordered field $F$
([[def-ordered-field]]). Equivalently, the canonical naturals are cofinal in $F$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $F$; write $A = \{\, n \cdot 1_F : n \ge 1 \,\}$ for the set of its canonical naturals.

[L1] Least-upper-bound property: every nonempty $S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound $\sup S \in F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Each canonical natural satisfies $n \cdot 1_F > 0$, one has $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L3] $0 < 1_F$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $F$ is not Archimedean: there is some $x \in F$ with $n \cdot 1_F \le x$ for all $n \ge 1$, that is, $x$ is an upper bound of $A$. [assume-contra]

2.1 The set $A$ is nonempty, since $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F \in A$, and it is bounded above by $x$. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 By the least-upper-bound property, $A$ has a least upper bound $s = \sup A \in F$. [step 2.1, L1]

4.1 Since $1_F > 0$, we have $s - 1_F < s$; as $s$ is the least upper bound, $s - 1_F$ is not an upper bound of $A$. [step 3.1, L3]

5.1 Hence there is some $m \ge 1$ with $m \cdot 1_F > s - 1_F$. [step 4.1]

6.1 Adding $1_F$ to both sides, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F > s$. [step 5.1, L2]

7.1 But $(m+1) \cdot 1_F \in A$, so $(m+1) \cdot 1_F \le s$ because $s$ is an upper bound of $A$, contradicting 6.1. [step 6.1, step 3.1, L2]

8.1 The assumption is therefore untenable, so $F$ is Archimedean. [step 7.1, discharge-contradiction] ∎
