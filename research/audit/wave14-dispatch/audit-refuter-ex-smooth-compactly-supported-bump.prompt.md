You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as
an independent adversarial proof-refuter. Return evidence only; Audit-Alpha
alone adjudicates and edits.

## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` Statement or consumer, actively search for a
counterexample or a failure in the witness or cited generated premise. A false
public claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or
materially inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is
nonfatal.

Return no more than 450 words, exactly in this shape:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

For each defect:

```text
FINDING 1
  location: [exact section/fact/step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [exact assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]
```

Always end with:

```text
BOUNDARY: [specific boundary/counterexample checks and disposition]
SOURCES:  [confirm every supplied cited item used by the target was inspected]
CHECKED:  [confirm title, public claim, every numbered step, and Remarks]
```

## Example

Let $\phi$ be [[ex-flat-exponential-function]] and define $b(x)=\phi(1-x^2)$. Then $b$ is smooth, positive on $(-1,1)$, and zero outside $[-1,1]$; its support is $[-1,1]$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The displayed composite.

[L1] $\phi$ is smooth and flat at $0$ ([[ex-flat-exponential-function]]).

[L2] Products and composites preserve smoothness ([[thm-chain-rule]], [[thm-algebra-of-derivatives]], [[cor-power-series-sums-are-smooth-with-coefficient-formula]]).

[L3] Closure, boundary, and interior are [[def-metric-interior-closure-boundary]].

## Verification

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 On $|x|<1$, $1-x^2>0$, so $b(x)>0$; on $|x|\ge1$, $1-x^2\le0$, so $b(x)=0$.  [given, L1]

1.2 Away from $\pm1$, smoothness follows from [L2]. At $\pm1$, every one-sided derivative from inside is a finite sum of derivatives of $\phi$ at $0$, all zero by [L1], matching the zero function outside.  [L1, L2]

2.1 Thus $b$ is smooth and its nonzero set is $(-1,1)$, whose closure is $[-1,1]$; this is its support.  [step 1.1, step 1.2, L3] ∎

## Statement

Let $f(x)=\sum_{n\ge0}a_n(x-c)^n$ have positive or infinite radius $R$. Define $f^{(0)}:=f$ and $f^{(m+1)}:=(f^{(m)})'$. Then every derivative exists on $|x-c|<R$, and for each $m\in\mathbb N$,

$$f^{(m)}(x)=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\iota\!\left((m+j)^{\underline m}\right)a_{m+j}(x-c)^j.$$

In particular,

$$f^{(m)}(c)=\iota(m!)a_m,\qquad a_m=\frac{f^{(m)}(c)}{\iota(m!)}.$$

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A power-series sum $f$ of radius $R>0$ and the recursively defined derivatives $f^{(m)}$.

[L1] A power series may be differentiated term by term throughout its open radius, and its first derived series has the same radius ([[thm-termwise-differentiation-of-a-real-power-series]]).

[L2] Falling factorials satisfy $n^{\underline0}=1$ and $n^{\underline{k+1}}=n^{\underline k}(n-k)$ for all natural $n,k$, with truncated difference $n-k$, and $n^{\underline n}=n!\ne0$ ([[def-factorial-and-falling-factorial]]); the canonical embedding into $\mathbb R$ is multiplicative and injective ([[lem-nat-finite-sum-laws-and-the-canonical-embedding]]).

[L3] The induction principle on $\mathbb N$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 For $m=0$, the formula reads $f(x)=\sum_{j\ge0}\iota(j^{\underline0})a_j(x-c)^j=\sum_{j\ge0}a_j(x-c)^j$, so the claim holds. [base, given, L2]

1.2 Fix $m$ and assume the displayed formula for $f^{(m)}$, with radius $R$. [ih]

2.1 By [L1], differentiate the series in step 1.2 term by term. Reindexing $j+1$ as $j$ gives $f^{(m+1)}(x)=\sum_{j\ge0}\iota(j+1)\iota((m+j+1)^{\underline m})a_{m+j+1}(x-c)^j$. [step 1.2, L1]

3.1 The falling-factorial recursion with $n=m+j+1$ and $k=m$ gives $(m+j+1)^{\underline{m+1}}=(m+j+1)^{\underline m}(j+1)$. Since $\iota$ preserves products, step 2.1 is precisely the asserted formula with $m+1$ in place of $m$. [step 2.1, L2, algebra]

4.1 By [L3], the derivative formula holds for every $m$. At each induction step [L1] also preserves the radius $R$, so every derived series has radius $R$. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L1, L3, discharge-induction]

5.1 At $x=c$, every term with $j\ge1$ vanishes and the $j=0$ term is $\iota(m^{\underline m})a_m=\iota(m!)a_m$; since $m!\ne0$, division gives the coefficient formula. [step 4.1, L2, discharge-induction] ∎

## Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]), let $A \subseteq X$ and let
$x \in X$. Balls are as in [[def-metric-ball]] and open sets as in
[[def-metric-topology]]; recall that a real $r$ written as a radius is always
$> 0$.

- $x$ is an **interior point** of $A$ if $B(x,r) \subseteq A$ for some $r$. The
  set of interior points is the **interior** $\operatorname{int}(A)$.
- $x$ is an **adherent point** of $A$ if $B(x,r) \cap A \ne \emptyset$ for every
  $r$. The set of adherent points is the **closure** $\overline{A}$.
- $x$ is a **limit point** (accumulation point) of $A$ if
  $B(x,r) \cap (A \setminus \{x\}) \ne \emptyset$ for every $r$. The set of limit
  points is the **derived set** $A'$.
- $x$ is an **isolated point** of $A$ if $x \in A$ and $B(x,r) \cap A = \{x\}$
  for some $r$.
- The **boundary** of $A$ is $\partial A := \overline{A} \setminus \operatorname{int}(A)$.
- $A$ is **dense** in $X$ if $\overline{A} = X$.

**The interior is open, and it is the largest open subset of $A$.** If
$x \in \operatorname{int}(A)$, fix $r$ with $B(x,r) \subseteq A$; the ball
$B(x,r)$ is itself open ([[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]]), so every
$y \in B(x,r)$ has some $s$ with $B(y,s) \subseteq B(x,r) \subseteq A$, which
puts $y$ in $\operatorname{int}(A)$. Hence $B(x,r) \subseteq \operatorname{int}(A)$
and $\operatorname{int}(A)$ is open. It is contained in $A$, since
$x \in B(x,r) \subseteq A$ for an interior point $x$; and if $V \subseteq A$ is
open then every $v \in V$ has a ball inside $V \subseteq A$, so
$V \subseteq \operatorname{int}(A)$.

**Two descriptions of the boundary agree.** $x \in \partial A$ says that every
ball around $x$ meets $A$ and that no ball around $x$ is contained in $A$; the
second half says exactly that every ball around $x$ meets $X \setminus A$. So

$$\partial A = \{\, x \in X : B(x,r) \cap A \ne \emptyset \text{ and } B(x,r) \cap (X \setminus A) \ne \emptyset \text{ for every } r \,\},$$

from which $\partial A = \partial(X \setminus A)$ is immediate.

**Elementary containments, straight from the definitions.** $A \subseteq \overline{A}$,
because $x \in A$ lies in every $B(x,r) \cap A$; $A' \subseteq \overline{A}$,
because a ball meeting $A \setminus \{x\}$ meets $A$; and
$\operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq A \subseteq \overline{A}$. A point of $A$ is
either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$, and not both, according to
whether some ball meets $A$ only in $x$.

## Remarks

- **The closure is defined here by adherent points and by nothing else.** That it
  is closed, that it is the smallest closed set containing $A$, that for nonempty
  $A$ it is $\{x : d(x,A) = 0\}$, and that it consists of the limits of sequences
  from $A$, are theorems ([[thm-metric-closure-characterisation]],
  [[thm-metric-sequential-closure]]) and are proved from this definition.
- **Limit point of a set is not the same notion as subsequential limit of a
  sequence** ([[def-subsequential-limit]]), which this library deliberately keeps
  under a different name: the constant sequence $x_k = 0$ has $0$ as a
  subsequential limit, while its set of values $\{0\}$ has no limit point at all.
- **Dense is relative to the ambient space**, and the ambient space is part of
  the data: $A$ is dense in $X$ when $\overline{A} = X$, with $\overline{A}$
  computed in $(X,d)$. The same $A$ inside a larger space is a different
  question.

## Example

Define
$$\phi(x)=\begin{cases}\exp(-1/x),&x>0,\\0,&x\le0.\end{cases}$$
Then $\phi\in C^\infty(\mathbb R)$ and $\phi^{(m)}(0)=0$ for every $m\in\mathbb N$, although $\phi(x)>0$ for $x>0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The displayed function.

[L1] Exponential dominates every polynomial ([[thm-exponential-beats-every-polynomial]]).

[L2] Exponential is smooth, with positive values ([[thm-derivative-of-exponential]], [[cor-power-series-sums-are-smooth-with-coefficient-formula]], [[cor-exponential-reciprocal-and-positivity]]).

[L3] Products and composites are differentiable by [[thm-algebra-of-derivatives]] and [[thm-chain-rule]].

## Verification

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 On $x>0$, repeated product and chain rules give $\phi^{(m)}(x)=P_m(1/x)\exp(-1/x)$ for a polynomial $P_m$; on $x<0$, every derivative is $0$.   [base, L2, L3, given]

2.1 If the formula holds at order $m$, differentiating produces another polynomial $P_{m+1}(1/x)$ times $\exp(-1/x)$. By [L1], this tends to $0$ as $x\to0^+$.  [ih, step 1.1, L1, L2, L3]

3.1 The difference quotient for the $m$-th derivative at $0$ is again a polynomial in $1/x$ times $\exp(-1/x)$, so it tends to $0$. Induction therefore extends every derivative continuously across $0$, with value $0$.   [step 2.1, L1, given, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $c \in A$ be a limit point of $A$
([[def-limit-point-r]]), let $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ be differentiable at $c$
([[def-derivative]]) and let $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$. Then:

1. $f + g$ is differentiable at $c$ and $(f+g)'(c) = f'(c) + g'(c)$;
2. $\alpha f$ is differentiable at $c$ and $(\alpha f)'(c) = \alpha f'(c)$;
3. $fg$ is differentiable at $c$ and $(fg)'(c) = f'(c)g(c) + f(c)g'(c)$;
4. if $g(c) \ne 0$ then, writing $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$, the
   point $c$ lies in $A_0$ and is a limit point of $A_0$, the quotient
   $(f/g)|_{A_0} : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$, $x \mapsto f(x)/g(x)$, is differentiable
   at $c$ as a function on $A_0$, and
   $$\bigl((f/g)|_{A_0}\bigr)'(c) \;=\; \frac{f'(c)\,g(c) - f(c)\,g'(c)}{g(c)^{2}} .$$

Each claim asserts two things: that the derivative on the left exists, and that
it has the stated value. Both are proved.

**Why claim 4 is stated on $A_0$.** The function $f/g$ is not defined where $g$
vanishes, and $g$ may vanish at points of $A$ far from $c$; restricting to $A_0$
is forced. That the restriction still has $c$ as a limit point, so that a
derivative there means anything at all, is not free either, and it is the last
claim of [[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]] applied to $g$. The hypothesis
is $g(c) \ne 0$, not "$g$ vanishes nowhere".

**Everything is proved through
[[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]].** No difference quotient is estimated and
no limit theorem beyond continuity is used, so no choice principle is spent.
The four identities are four algebraic rearrangements of an increment, each
followed by a reading of [[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a point $c \in A$ that is a limit point of $A$, functions $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ differentiable at $c$, and a real $\alpha$; for claim 4 also the hypothesis $g(c) \ne 0$ together with $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$ ([[def-derivative]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L1] Carathéodory's characterisation ([[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]]), used in both directions: for a set $B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a point $p \in B$ that is a limit point of $B$ and a function $h : B \to \mathbb{R}$, the function $h$ is differentiable at $p$ if and only if there is $\eta : B \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $p$, with $h(x) - h(p) = \eta(x)(x - p)$ for every $x \in B$, and then $\eta(p) = h'(p)$.

[L2] Algebra of continuous functions ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]]): sums, scalar multiples and products of functions continuous at a point are continuous there (claim 1); every constant function and the identity are continuous everywhere on the domain (claim 5); and if $u, v$ are continuous at a point $p$ of their common domain $D$ with $v(p) \ne 0$, then $p$ lies in $D_0 := \{x \in D : v(x) \ne 0\}$ and $(u/v)|_{D_0}$ is continuous at $p$ as a function on $D_0$ (claim 4).

[L3] Continuity passes to a subset of the domain: if $B \subseteq A$, if $p \in B$ and if $\psi : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $p$, then $\psi|_B$ is continuous at $p$, the condition on the restriction quantifying over fewer points ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L4] A function differentiable at $c$ is continuous at $c$ ([[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]]); in particular $g$ is.

[L5] At a limit point $c$ of $A$, continuity of $g$ at $c$ says exactly that $\lim_{x \to c} g(x)$ exists and equals $g(c)$ ([[def-continuity-real]], clause 1, [[def-function-limit]]).

[L6] Sign preservation ([[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]]): if $c$ is a limit point of $A$ and $\lim_{x \to c} g(x)$ exists and is nonzero, then $c$ is a limit point of $A_0 = \{x \in A : g(x) \ne 0\}$.

[L7] A product of two nonzero reals is nonzero ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]), and $g(c)^{2} = g(c)\,g(c)$ ([[def-integer-power]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L1], applied to $f$ and to $g$ on $A$ at $c$, fix $\varphi, \psi : A \to \mathbb{R}$, both continuous at $c$, with $f(x) - f(c) = \varphi(x)(x - c)$ and $g(x) - g(c) = \psi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in A$, and with $\varphi(c) = f'(c)$ and $\psi(c) = g'(c)$. [L1, choose]

1.2 Assume $g(c) \ne 0$. Then $c \in A_0$ by the definition of $A_0$; $g$ is continuous at $c$ by [L4], so $\lim_{x \to c} g(x) = g(c) \ne 0$ by [L5]; and therefore $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$ by [L6]. [L4, L5, L6]

2.1 **Sum.** For every $x \in A$, $(f+g)(x) - (f+g)(c) = \bigl(f(x)-f(c)\bigr) + \bigl(g(x)-g(c)\bigr) = \bigl(\varphi(x) + \psi(x)\bigr)(x-c)$. The function $\varphi + \psi$ is continuous at $c$ by [L2], and $(\varphi+\psi)(c) = f'(c) + g'(c)$. So [L1] gives claim 1. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.2 **Scalar multiple.** For every $x \in A$, $(\alpha f)(x) - (\alpha f)(c) = \alpha\bigl(f(x)-f(c)\bigr) = \bigl(\alpha\varphi(x)\bigr)(x-c)$. The function $\alpha\varphi$ is continuous at $c$ by [L2], with value $\alpha f'(c)$ there. So [L1] gives claim 2. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.3 **Product.** For every $x \in A$, $f(x)g(x) - f(c)g(c) = \bigl(f(x)-f(c)\bigr)g(x) + f(c)\bigl(g(x)-g(c)\bigr) = \bigl(\varphi(x)g(x) + f(c)\psi(x)\bigr)(x-c)$. Put $\chi := \varphi\,g + f(c)\,\psi$; it is continuous at $c$ by [L2], since $\varphi$, $\psi$ and (by [L4]) $g$ are, and constants are; and $\chi(c) = \varphi(c)g(c) + f(c)\psi(c) = f'(c)g(c) + f(c)g'(c)$. So [L1] gives claim 3. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L4]

2.4 **Quotient, the rearrangement.** Assume $g(c) \ne 0$ and let $x \in A_0$, so $g(x) \ne 0$ and $g(c) \ne 0$. Then $f(x)/g(x) - f(c)/g(c) = \bigl(f(x)g(c) - f(c)g(x)\bigr)/\bigl(g(x)g(c)\bigr)$, and $f(x)g(c) - f(c)g(x) = \bigl(f(x)-f(c)\bigr)g(c) - f(c)\bigl(g(x)-g(c)\bigr) = \bigl(\varphi(x)g(c) - f(c)\psi(x)\bigr)(x-c)$. So, defining $\theta : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$ by $\theta(x) := \bigl(\varphi(x)g(c) - f(c)\psi(x)\bigr)/\bigl(g(x)g(c)\bigr)$, one has $(f/g)|_{A_0}(x) - (f/g)|_{A_0}(c) = \theta(x)(x-c)$ for every $x \in A_0$. [step 1.1, L1, L7]

2.5 **Quotient, continuity of the factor.** Assume $g(c) \ne 0$. The restrictions of $\varphi$, $\psi$ and $g$ to $A_0$ are continuous at $c \in A_0$ by [L3] and [L4], so by [L2] the numerator $u(x) := \varphi(x)g(c) - f(c)\psi(x)$ and the denominator $v(x) := g(x)g(c)$ are continuous at $c$ as functions on $A_0$. By [L7] the denominator vanishes at no point of $A_0$, so $\{x \in A_0 : v(x) \ne 0\} = A_0$, and $v(c) = g(c)^{2} \ne 0$; hence claim 4 of [L2] gives that $\theta = (u/v)|_{A_0}$ is continuous at $c$, with $\theta(c) = \bigl(\varphi(c)g(c) - f(c)\psi(c)\bigr)/g(c)^{2} = \bigl(f'(c)g(c) - f(c)g'(c)\bigr)/g(c)^{2}$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L2, L3, L4, L7]

3.1 **Quotient, conclusion.** Assume $g(c) \ne 0$. By step 1.2 the point $c$ lies in $A_0$ and is a limit point of $A_0$; by steps 2.4 and 2.5 the function $\theta : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$ and factors the increment of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$. So [L1], applied on the domain $A_0$ at the point $c$, gives that $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ is differentiable at $c$ with derivative $\theta(c)$: claim 4. [step 1.2, step 2.4, step 2.5, L1]

4.1 Claims 1 to 4 are proved, by steps 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 3.1 respectively, each by exhibiting the Carathéodory factor of the new function and reading its continuity at $c$ off the algebra of continuous functions. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The product rearrangement in one line.** The identity $fg - f(c)g(c) = (f - f(c))\,g + f(c)\,(g - g(c))$ splits the increment of a product into two increments, one multiplied by $g$ and one by a constant. It is the same identity that carries the product case of [[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]], read at the level of increments rather than of $\varepsilon$; here the factor $g$ has to be continuous at $c$ rather than merely bounded near it, and [[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]] is what supplies that.

- **The reciprocal is the case $f \equiv 1$.** Claim 4 then reads $\bigl((1/g)|_{A_0}\bigr)'(c) = -g'(c)/g(c)^{2}$, since $f'(c) = 0$ for a constant $f$; nothing separate has to be proved, and the derivative of a negative integer power on this page is obtained exactly this way.

- **Two hypotheses that look removable and are not.** In claim 4 the hypothesis $g(c) \ne 0$ cannot be weakened to "$g$ is nonzero somewhere near $c$", because $c$ itself must lie in the smaller domain for a derivative there to be a statement about $c$; and the conclusion is about $(f/g)|_{A_0}$, not about any extension of it to $A$, since no such extension is canonical.

## Statement

Let $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ with
$g[A] \subseteq B$ and let $f : B \to \mathbb{R}$, so that the composite
$f \circ g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is defined. Let $c \in A$ be a limit point of
$A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]) at which $g$ is differentiable
([[def-derivative]]), put $b := g(c)$, and suppose $b$ is a limit point of $B$
at which $f$ is differentiable. Then $f \circ g$ is differentiable at $c$ and

$$(f \circ g)'(c) \;=\; f'\bigl(g(c)\bigr)\,g'(c) .$$

**Both limit-point hypotheses are needed, and neither is automatic.** That $c$
is a limit point of $A$ is what makes $g'(c)$ and $(f \circ g)'(c)$ defined
symbols; that $b = g(c)$ is a limit point of $B$ is what makes $f'(b)$ one.
Nothing forces the second: $g$ may be differentiable at $c$ and send $c$ to an
isolated point of $B$, and there $f'(b)$ is not defined and the formula asserts
nothing.

**No case analysis appears anywhere.** The naive difference-quotient proof
writes $\frac{f(g(x)) - f(g(c))}{g(x) - g(c)} \cdot \frac{g(x) - g(c)}{x - c}$
and then has to say what happens where $g(x) = g(c)$, which may occur at points
arbitrarily close to $c$. Carathéodory's factorisation never divides by the
inner increment, so the difficulty does not arise.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sets $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, functions $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ with $g[A] \subseteq B$ and $f : B \to \mathbb{R}$, a point $c \in A$ that is a limit point of $A$ at which $g$ is differentiable, and the point $b := g(c) \in B$, a limit point of $B$ at which $f$ is differentiable ([[def-derivative]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L1] Carathéodory's characterisation ([[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]]), used in both directions: for $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a point $p \in D$ that is a limit point of $D$ and $h : D \to \mathbb{R}$, the function $h$ is differentiable at $p$ if and only if there is $\eta : D \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $p$, with $h(y) - h(p) = \eta(y)(y - p)$ for every $y \in D$, and then $\eta(p) = h'(p)$.

[L2] Algebra of continuous functions ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], claim 1): a product of two functions continuous at a point of their common domain is continuous there.

[L3] Composition of continuous functions ([[thm-composition-of-continuous-functions]]): if $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ has $g[A] \subseteq B$ and is continuous at $c \in A$, and if $\eta : B \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $g(c)$, then $\eta \circ g$ is continuous at $c$ ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L4] A function differentiable at a point is continuous there ([[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L1], applied to $g$ on $A$ at $c$, fix $\psi : A \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $c$, with $g(x) - g(c) = \psi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in A$ and $\psi(c) = g'(c)$. [L1, choose]

1.2 By [L1], applied to $f$ on $B$ at $b$, fix $\varphi : B \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $b$, with $f(y) - f(b) = \varphi(y)(y - b)$ for every $y \in B$ and $\varphi(b) = f'(b)$. [L1, choose]

2.1 **The factorisation.** Let $x \in A$. Then $g(x) \in B$, so taking $y := g(x)$ in step 1.2 gives $f(g(x)) - f(b) = \varphi(g(x))\bigl(g(x) - b\bigr)$, and $g(x) - b = g(x) - g(c) = \psi(x)(x-c)$ by step 1.1. Since $(f \circ g)(c) = f(g(c)) = f(b)$, this reads $(f \circ g)(x) - (f \circ g)(c) = \chi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in A$, where $\chi : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is the pointwise product $\chi := (\varphi \circ g)\,\psi$. [step 1.1, step 1.2]

2.2 **The outer factor is continuous at $c$.** By [L4] the function $g$ is continuous at $c$; by step 1.2 the function $\varphi$ is continuous at $b = g(c)$; and $g[A] \subseteq B$. So $\varphi \circ g$ is continuous at $c$ by [L3]. [step 1.2, L3, L4]

3.1 **The factor is continuous at $c$, with the right value.** $\chi$ is the product of $\varphi \circ g$, continuous at $c$ by step 2.2, with $\psi$, continuous at $c$ by step 1.1, so $\chi$ is continuous at $c$ by [L2]; and $\chi(c) = \varphi(g(c))\,\psi(c) = \varphi(b)\,\psi(c) = f'(b)\,g'(c)$. [step 1.1, step 2.2, L2]

4.1 By step 2.1 the function $\chi : A \to \mathbb{R}$ factors the increment of $f \circ g$ at $c$, and by step 3.1 it is continuous at $c$. So [L1], applied to $f \circ g$ on $A$ at the limit point $c$, gives that $f \circ g$ is differentiable at $c$ with $(f \circ g)'(c) = \chi(c) = f'(g(c))\,g'(c)$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the classical proof goes wrong, precisely.** It divides by $g(x) - g(c)$, which may vanish at points arbitrarily close to $c$ even when $g$ is differentiable at $c$ with $g'(c) = 0$; the usual repair defines an auxiliary function equal to the outer quotient off the bad set and to $f'(b)$ on it, and then proves that auxiliary function continuous. That auxiliary function is $\varphi \circ g$, and [[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]] is the observation that it exists before any repair is attempted.

- **What is composed is continuity, not differentiability.** The only theorem about composites used above is [[thm-composition-of-continuous-functions]], and it needs no side hypothesis, unlike the corresponding statement for limits. That is the whole reason the proof has no cases.

- **The formula is about the point $g(c)$, not about $g$ near $c$.** Both derivatives on the right are taken at single points, and the theorem says nothing about $f$ on the image of any neighbourhood of $c$. In particular no hypothesis is placed on $g[A]$ beyond its lying in $B$.

## Statement

The real exponential function is $C^\infty$, and for every $m\in\mathbb N$,
$$\exp^{(m)}=\exp.$$
In particular $(\exp)'=\exp$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The exponential power series.

[L1] A real power series may be differentiated termwise inside its radius ([[thm-termwise-differentiation-of-a-real-power-series]]), and its sum is smooth there ([[cor-power-series-sums-are-smooth-with-coefficient-formula]]).

[L2] The radius is infinite, $(n+1)!=(n+1)n!$, and the canonical embedding preserves products and sends positive naturals to nonzero reals ([[lem-exponential-series-has-infinite-radius]], [[def-factorial-and-falling-factorial]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Termwise differentiation gives $(\exp)'(x)=\sum_{n\ge1}\iota(n)x^{n-1}/\iota(n!)$.  [L1, L2]

2.1 Reindex $n=j+1$ and cancel $\iota(j+1)$ using the factorial recurrence. The series becomes $\sum_{j\ge0}x^j/\iota(j!)=\exp(x)$.  [step 1.1, L2, algebra]

3.1 Smoothness follows from [L1] and the infinite radius; iterating step 2.1 gives every higher derivative.  [step 2.1, L1, L2] ∎
