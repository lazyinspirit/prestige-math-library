You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as
an independent adversarial proof-refuter. Return evidence only; Audit-Alpha
alone adjudicates and edits.

## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` Statement or consumer, actively search for a
counterexample or a failure in the witness or cited generated premise. A false
public claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or
materially inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is
nonfatal.

Return no more than 450 words, exactly in this shape:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

For each defect:

```text
FINDING 1
  location: [exact section/fact/step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [exact assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]
```

Always end with:

```text
BOUNDARY: [specific boundary/counterexample checks and disposition]
SOURCES:  [confirm every supplied cited item used by the target was inspected]
CHECKED:  [confirm title, public claim, every numbered step, and Remarks]

## Statement refuted

The exponential function is uniformly continuous on $\mathbb R$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $\exp'=\exp$.

[L1] Uniform continuity is [[def-uniform-continuity-real]].

[L2] The exponential is strictly increasing ([[thm-exponential-is-strictly-increasing]]), the mean value theorem is [[cor-mean-value-theorem]], and exponential dominates polynomials ([[thm-exponential-beats-every-polynomial]]).

[L3] The reciprocal sequence $1/\iota(n)$ tends to $0$ when started at $n\ge1$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]]).

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For $n\ge1$, let $x_n=\iota(n)$ and $y_n=\iota(n)+1/\iota(n)$. Then $|y_n-x_n|=1/\iota(n)\to0$.  [L3]

1.2 By the mean value theorem, $\exp(y_n)-\exp(x_n)=\exp(c_n)/\iota(n)$ for some $c_n\in(x_n,y_n)$. Since exponential is increasing, this is at least $\exp(\iota(n))/\iota(n)$, which tends to $+\infty$ by [L2].   [L2, given]

2.1 Thus arbitrarily close pairs have image distances bounded away from $0$, contradicting the uniform-continuity condition [L1].  [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1] ∎

## Remarks

On every compact interval, $\exp$ is uniformly continuous by [[thm-heine-cantor-r]]; the failure is global.

## Statement

Let $F$ be a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and let
$\varepsilon \in F$ with $\varepsilon > 0$. Then there is a natural number
$n \ge 1$ such that

$$\frac{1}{n \cdot 1_F} < \varepsilon ,$$

where $n \cdot 1_F$ is the canonical natural of $F$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]]) and
$1/(n \cdot 1_F)$ is its multiplicative inverse ([[def-field]]). As is standard
we abbreviate $n \cdot 1_F$ to $n$ and write the conclusion $1/n < \varepsilon$.

This is the **reciprocal form** of the Archimedean property.
[[thm-of-archimedean]] on its own delivers only the assertion that the canonical
naturals are cofinal, $x < n \cdot 1_F$; the form actually used in analysis, that
the reciprocals of the naturals get below every positive bound, is the statement
above, and it is recorded separately so that no proof has to reconstruct the
inversion step in passing.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $F$ and an element $\varepsilon \in F$ with $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] Archimedean property: for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Inverses and order: if $a > 0$ then $a^{-1} > 0$, and if $0 < a < b$ then $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Field arithmetic: an element $a$ with $a > 0$ is nonzero by trichotomy, hence has a multiplicative inverse $a^{-1}$, and $(a^{-1})^{-1} = a$ ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Since $\varepsilon > 0$, trichotomy gives $\varepsilon \ne 0$, so $\varepsilon^{-1}$ exists, and $\varepsilon^{-1} > 0$. [given, L2, L3]

2.1 Apply [L1] to $x = \varepsilon^{-1}$: fix a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $\varepsilon^{-1} < n \cdot 1_F$. [step 1.1, L1, choose]

3.1 Chaining the two displayed inequalities gives $0 < \varepsilon^{-1} < n \cdot 1_F$; in particular $n \cdot 1_F > 0$, so $n \cdot 1_F \ne 0$ and $1/(n \cdot 1_F)$ is defined. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L3]

4.1 Apply the second claim of [L2] with $a = \varepsilon^{-1}$ and $b = n \cdot 1_F$: $0 < (n \cdot 1_F)^{-1} < (\varepsilon^{-1})^{-1}$. [step 3.1, L2]

5.1 By [L3], $(\varepsilon^{-1})^{-1} = \varepsilon$, so the natural number $n \ge 1$ fixed in step 2.1 satisfies $1/(n \cdot 1_F) < \varepsilon$, which is the assertion. [step 4.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Monotonicity gives the eventual form for free.** If $m \ge n \ge 1$ then
  $m \cdot 1_F \ge n \cdot 1_F > 0$, because $k \mapsto k \cdot 1_F$ is strictly
  increasing on the naturals $\ge 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]), and so
  $1/(m \cdot 1_F) \le 1/(n \cdot 1_F) < \varepsilon$ by [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]
  again. So the corollary yields not merely one index but a threshold: every
  $m \ge n$ satisfies $1/m < \varepsilon$. That one extra line is what a
  convergence proof needs, and it is left to the caller rather than folded into
  the statement, because the caller usually has a threshold of its own to combine
  it with.

- **Completeness is used only through [[thm-of-archimedean]].** Nothing here
  needs the least-upper-bound property directly. The corollary therefore holds
  verbatim in any Archimedean ordered field, in particular in $\mathbb{Q}$, and
  it fails in a non-Archimedean ordered field, where an infinitesimal
  $\varepsilon > 0$ is below every $1/n$ by construction.

- The equivalence is exact: the reciprocal form implies the cofinal form back
  again, since given $x > 0$ one applies it to $\varepsilon = 1/x$. The two are
  the same property written on the two sides of the inversion, and only the
  direction proved above is used in this library.

## Statement

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$ and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be
continuous on $[a,b]$ ([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-interval]]) and
differentiable at every point of $(a,b)$ as a function on $[a,b]$
([[def-derivative]]). Then there is $c \in (a,b)$ with

$$f(b) - f(a) \;=\; f'(c)\,(b - a) .$$

Equivalently, since $b - a \ne 0$, there is $c \in (a,b)$ at which
$f'(c) = \bigl(f(b)-f(a)\bigr)/(b-a)$: the derivative somewhere inside equals
the average rate of change across the whole interval.

**Continuity on the closed interval cannot be dropped.** Differentiability at
every point of $(a,b)$ alone does not suffice: a function on $[0,1]$,
differentiable at every point of $(0,1)$ with derivative constantly $1$, for
which no $c$ works, is exhibited later on this page as a false statement, and
the companion page works the same witness out in full.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and a function $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable at every point of $(a,b)$.

[L1] Cauchy's mean value theorem ([[thm-cauchy-mean-value]]): for $f, g$ continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable at every point of $(a,b)$ there is $c \in (a,b)$ with $\bigl(f(b)-f(a)\bigr)g'(c) = \bigl(g(b)-g(a)\bigr)f'(c)$.

[L2] The identity $x \mapsto x$ is continuous at every point of any $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], claim 5).

[L3] The identity $g$ on $[a,b]$ is differentiable at every $c \in [a,b]$ with $g'(c) = 1$: with $a < b$ the set $[a,b]$ is order-convex with at least two elements, so every one of its points is a limit point of it ([[def-derivative]], [[def-interval]]); and the difference quotient of $g$ at $c$ is $(x - c)/(x - c) = 1$ for every $x \in [a,b]$ with $x \ne c$, a constant function, whose limit at $c$ is $1$ ([[def-function-limit]], [[def-derivative]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Define $g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ by $g(x) := x$. [construct]

2.1 $g$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ by [L2]; it is differentiable at every $c \in (a,b)$ with $g'(c) = 1$ by [L3]; and $g(b) - g(a) = b - a$. [step 1.1, L2, L3]

3.1 By step 2.1 the pair $f, g$ satisfies every hypothesis of [L1], so there is $c \in (a,b)$ with $\bigl(f(b)-f(a)\bigr)g'(c) = \bigl(g(b)-g(a)\bigr)f'(c)$. Substituting $g'(c) = 1$ and $g(b)-g(a) = b-a$ gives $f(b) - f(a) = f'(c)(b-a)$. [step 2.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The geometric reading, and what it is not.** The conclusion says that some tangent line is parallel to the chord from $(a, f(a))$ to $(b, f(b))$. It does not say which one, it does not say there is only one, and it says nothing at all about $f$ between the endpoints beyond the hypotheses. Every use of the theorem on this page is a use of the equation, never of the picture.

- **Why this is a corollary and not the primitive statement.** [[thm-cauchy-mean-value]] is proved from [[thm-rolle]] with one auxiliary function, and this statement is that theorem at $g(x) = x$; deriving it the other way round, from this statement to Cauchy's, is also possible but needs an auxiliary function of its own, so nothing is saved. What matters is that both rest on Rolle, and Rolle on the extreme value theorem.

- **The two hypotheses are on different sets on purpose.** Continuity is asked for on the closed interval and differentiability only on the open one, so nothing at all is required of the difference quotients at $a$ and at $b$. Weakening the continuity in step with the differentiability, so that both are asked for on $(a,b)$ only, destroys the theorem, which is exactly what [[cex-mean-value-theorem-fails-without-continuity-at-the-endpoints]] shows on the companion page.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$. Then $f$ is
**uniformly continuous on $A$** when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x, x' \in A)\ \bigl[\ |x - x'| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - f(x')| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

with $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ ranging over the positive reals.

**The whole content is in the order of the quantifiers.** Written out,
continuity on $A$ ([[def-continuity-real]]) is

$$\forall \varepsilon\ \forall c \in A\ \exists \delta\ \forall x \in A ,$$

and uniform continuity is

$$\forall \varepsilon\ \exists \delta\ \forall x' \in A\ \forall x \in A .$$

Moving $\exists \delta$ to the left of the point quantifier is the entire
difference: for continuity the radius may shrink from point to point, for
uniform continuity one radius must serve the whole of $A$ at once. This is the
same distinction, for the same reason, that [[def-metric-uniform-continuity]]
draws for maps of metric spaces.

**Uniform continuity implies continuity.** Given $\varepsilon > 0$, take the
$\delta$ supplied by uniform continuity and, at a point $c \in A$, apply the
condition with $x' := c$: every $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ satisfies
$|f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$. So the same $\delta$ witnesses continuity at
every point of $A$ simultaneously. The converse fails, and the failure is not
marginal: [[fs-continuity-implies-uniform-continuity]] refutes it on this page,
and the companion page works two witnesses out in full.

**Uniform continuity is a property of the pair $(f, A)$, not of $f$ alone.** The
same formula may be uniformly continuous on one set and not on another:
$x \mapsto 1/x$ is uniformly continuous on $[1,\infty)$ and not on $(0,1)$, and
$x \mapsto x^{2}$ is uniformly continuous on every bounded interval and not on
$\mathbb{R}$. Restricting the domain therefore never destroys uniform
continuity, since the condition then quantifies over fewer pairs; enlarging it
may.

**The two points are unordered and may coincide.** Nothing above excludes
$x = x'$, at which the implication reads $|f(x) - f(x)| = 0 < \varepsilon$
([[lem-of-abs-value]]) and is automatic, and the condition is symmetric in the
two points because $|x - x'| = |x' - x|$.

## Remarks

- **A single $\delta$, and a picture.** For a uniformly continuous $f$ one may
  slide a rectangle of width $\delta$ and height $2\varepsilon$ along the graph
  and never have the graph leave it through the top or bottom. For a merely
  continuous $f$ the rectangle must be narrowed as one moves, and on
  $x \mapsto 1/x$ over $(0,1)$ it must be narrowed without limit.

- **Neighbourhood form.** The condition says
  $f\bigl(A \cap N_{\delta}(x')\bigr) \subseteq N_{\varepsilon}(f(x'))$ for
  every $x' \in A$, with one $\delta$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). That is
  continuity on $A$ with the radius independent of the centre.

- **On an interval this is the notion the extension theorem needs.** A
  uniformly continuous function on a set $D$ extends to one on the closure of
  $D$ ([[cor-continuous-extension-from-a-dense-subset-r]]); mere continuity does
  not suffice, since $x \mapsto 1/x$ on $(0,1)$ has no continuous extension to
  $[0,1]$ ([[def-interval]]).

- **The two standard witnesses, for orientation.** The converse fails in two
  independent ways, each worked out on the companion page:
  [[cex-one-over-x-is-not-uniformly-continuous-on-the-unit-interval]] on a
  bounded domain that is not closed, and
  [[cex-x-squared-is-not-uniformly-continuous-on-r]] on a closed domain that is
  not bounded. Both are named here for orientation only; nothing in this
  definition rests on them.

- **Lipschitz and Hölder conditions are stronger still, and are not redefined
  here.** They are [[def-lipschitz-holder-contraction]] instantiated at
  $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ with $d(x,y) = |x-y|$; the dictionary that makes that
  instantiation legitimate, and that transports the implications of
  [[thm-metric-regularity-hierarchy]] to real functions, is
  [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]], immediately below.

## Statement

The real exponential function is $C^\infty$, and for every $m\in\mathbb N$,
$$\exp^{(m)}=\exp.$$
In particular $(\exp)'=\exp$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The exponential power series.

[L1] A real power series may be differentiated termwise inside its radius ([[thm-termwise-differentiation-of-a-real-power-series]]), and its sum is smooth there ([[cor-power-series-sums-are-smooth-with-coefficient-formula]]).

[L2] The radius is infinite, $(n+1)!=(n+1)n!$, and the canonical embedding preserves products and sends positive naturals to nonzero reals ([[lem-exponential-series-has-infinite-radius]], [[def-factorial-and-falling-factorial]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Termwise differentiation gives $(\exp)'(x)=\sum_{n\ge1}\iota(n)x^{n-1}/\iota(n!)$.  [L1, L2]

2.1 Reindex $n=j+1$ and cancel $\iota(j+1)$ using the factorial recurrence. The series becomes $\sum_{j\ge0}x^j/\iota(j!)=\exp(x)$.  [step 1.1, L2, algebra]

3.1 Smoothness follows from [L1] and the infinite radius; iterating step 2.1 gives every higher derivative.  [step 2.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Statement

For every $m\in\mathbb N$ and every real $a>0$,
$$\frac{x^m}{\exp(ax)}\longrightarrow0\qquad(x\to+\infty).$$

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $m\in\mathbb N$ and $a>0$.

[L1] Every term of the exponential series is nonnegative at a nonnegative argument ([[def-real-exponential-function-and-e]]).

[L2] The exponential reciprocal identity is [[cor-exponential-reciprocal-and-positivity]], and limits at infinity are [[def-limits-at-infinity]].

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For $x>0$, retain term $m+1$ of the series at $ax$: $\exp(ax)\ge (ax)^{m+1}/\iota((m+1)!)$.   [L1, given]

2.1 Hence $0\le x^m/\exp(ax)\le \iota((m+1)!)/(a^{m+1}x)$.  [step 1.1, L2, algebra]

## Statement

The exponential function is continuous and strictly increasing on $\mathbb R$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The exponential function.

[L1] Its derivative equals itself ([[thm-derivative-of-exponential]]) and it is everywhere positive ([[cor-exponential-reciprocal-and-positivity]]).

[L2] The mean value theorem applies to a continuous function on a closed interval and converts a positive interior derivative into strict increase ([[cor-mean-value-theorem]]). A power-series sum is continuous at every point strictly inside its convergence interval, and the exponential series has infinite radius ([[cor-power-series-sums-are-continuous]], [[lem-exponential-series-has-infinite-radius]]).

## Proof

1.1 If $x<y$, the mean value theorem gives $\exp(y)-\exp(x)=\exp(c)(y-x)$ for some $c\in(x,y)$.  [L1, L2]

2.1 Both factors on the right are positive, so $\exp(y)>\exp(x)$. Continuity is the cited power-series conclusion.  [step 1.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Statement

Let $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be compact ([[def-open-cover-r]]) and let
$f : K \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $K$ ([[def-continuity-real]]). Then $f$
is uniformly continuous on $K$ ([[def-uniform-continuity-real]]).

**This theorem is stated twice in this library, on purpose.** Its metric-space
twin is [[thm-heine-cantor-metric]], proved there from the cover machinery of
metric spaces; the proof below is $\mathbb{R}$-native and runs through
[[thm-compact-iff-sequentially-compact-r]], which is order-based. That the two
statements are the same statement in two vocabularies is
[[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]], clauses 1, 2 and 5, immediately above.

**The choice cost, named.** The proof invokes the axiom of countable choice
([[def-countable-choice]]) exactly once, at step 3.1, to select one bad pair of
points from each of countably many nonempty sets. The backward implication of
[[thm-compact-iff-sequentially-compact-r]] also spends countable choice, and
that item names its own uses; the forward implication used here, from compact to
sequentially compact, does not. No claim is made that the axiom is necessary
for either.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A compact set $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a function $f : K \to \mathbb{R}$ continuous on $K$.

[L1] Uniform continuity on $K$: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that all $x, x' \in K$ with $|x - x'| < \delta$ satisfy $|f(x) - f(x')| < \varepsilon$. Its negation: there is a real $\varepsilon_0 > 0$ such that for every real $\delta > 0$ some pair $x, x' \in K$ has $|x - x'| < \delta$ and $|f(x) - f(x')| \ge \varepsilon_0$ ([[def-uniform-continuity-real]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] A compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is sequentially compact: every sequence with all terms in $K$ has a subsequence converging to a point of $K$ ([[thm-compact-iff-sequentially-compact-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]], [[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L3] Countable choice: for a family $(P_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of nonempty sets there is a function on $\mathbb{N}$ picking an element of each ([[def-countable-choice]]).

[L4] A strictly increasing index map satisfies $n_j \ge j$ ([[lem-index-map-grows]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L5] Archimedean property in reciprocal form: for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \eta$; and $0 < s \le t$ implies $1/t \le 1/s$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

[L6] Sequential criterion, the choice-free direction: if $f$ is continuous at $p \in K$ and $(z_j)$ has terms in $K$ with $z_j \to p$, then $f(z_j) \to f(p)$ ([[thm-sequential-criterion-for-continuity]], [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L7] Triangle inequality and absolute value: $|u + v| \le |u| + |v|$, $|{-u}| = |u|$, $|u| \ge 0$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L8] Convergence of real sequences is tested at rational $\varepsilon > 0$, and below every positive real lies a positive rational, so the test may equally be run at every real $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-real-limit]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose $f$ is not uniformly continuous on $K$. By [L1] fix a real $\varepsilon_0 > 0$ such that for every real $\delta > 0$ there are $x, x' \in K$ with $|x - x'| < \delta$ and $|f(x) - f(x')| \ge \varepsilon_0$. [L1, assume-contra]

2.1 For $k \in \mathbb{N}$ put $P_k := \{\, (x,x') \in K \times K \ : \ |x - x'| < 1/(k+1) \text{ and } |f(x) - f(x')| \ge \varepsilon_0 \,\}$. Since $1/(k+1) > 0$, step 1.1 makes every $P_k$ nonempty. [step 1.1, L5]

3.1 By [L3] applied to the family $(P_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ fix a function $k \mapsto (x_k, x'_k)$ with $(x_k, x'_k) \in P_k$ for every $k$. **This is the single use of countable choice in this proof.** [step 2.1, L3, choose]

4.1 $(x_k)$ is a sequence of reals with all terms in $K$, so by [L2] there are a strictly increasing $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ and $p \in K$ with $x_{n_j} \to p$. [step 3.1, L2, choose]

5.1 **The second sequence converges to $p$ as well.** Let a rational $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. By [L5] and [L8] fix $J_1$ with $1/(j+1) < \varepsilon/2$ for every $j \ge J_1$, and by step 4.1 fix $J_2$ with $|x_{n_j} - p| < \varepsilon/2$ for every $j \ge J_2$. For $j \ge \max\{J_1, J_2\}$, using $(x_{n_j}, x'_{n_j}) \in P_{n_j}$ and $n_j \ge j$ from [L4], we get $|x'_{n_j} - x_{n_j}| < 1/(n_j+1) \le 1/(j+1) < \varepsilon/2$, hence $|x'_{n_j} - p| \le |x'_{n_j} - x_{n_j}| + |x_{n_j} - p| < \varepsilon$ by [L7]. So $x'_{n_j} \to p$. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L4, L5, L7, L8]

6.1 The point $p$ lies in $K$ and $f$ is continuous at $p$, so [L6] applied to the two sequences of steps 4.1 and 5.1, both with terms in $K$, gives $f(x_{n_j}) \to f(p)$ and $f(x'_{n_j}) \to f(p)$. [step 4.1, step 5.1, L6]

7.1 By [L8] fix a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \varepsilon_0/2$, and by step 6.1 fix $J$ with $|f(x_{n_j}) - f(p)| < \varepsilon$ and $|f(x'_{n_j}) - f(p)| < \varepsilon$ for every $j \ge J$. For such $j$, [L7] gives $|f(x_{n_j}) - f(x'_{n_j})| \le |f(x_{n_j}) - f(p)| + |f(p) - f(x'_{n_j})| < 2\varepsilon < \varepsilon_0$. [step 6.1, L7, L8, choose]

8.1 But $(x_{n_j}, x'_{n_j}) \in P_{n_j}$ gives $|f(x_{n_j}) - f(x'_{n_j})| \ge \varepsilon_0$ for every $j$, which contradicts step 7.1. The assumption of step 1.1 is therefore false, and $f$ is uniformly continuous on $K$. [step 3.1, step 7.1, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where compactness is used, and where continuity is used.** Compactness is used once, in step 4.1, to extract a convergent subsequence; continuity is used once, in step 6.1, at the single point $p$ that the extraction produces. Neither can be weakened: $x \mapsto 1/x$ on $(0,1)$ is continuous on a bounded non-closed set and not uniformly continuous ([[cex-one-over-x-is-not-uniformly-continuous-on-the-unit-interval]]), and $x \mapsto x^{2}$ on $\mathbb{R}$ is continuous on a closed unbounded set and not uniformly continuous ([[cex-x-squared-is-not-uniformly-continuous-on-r]]).

- **The converse is sharp.** For every noncompact $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ that is bounded there is a continuous function on $E$ that is not uniformly continuous, and for every noncompact $E$ there is an unbounded continuous function and a bounded continuous one with no greatest value. That is [[thm-compactness-is-necessary-for-evt-and-uniform-continuity]], later on this page, and together with this theorem it says that compactness is exactly the hypothesis these results need.

- **The pairs, not the points, are what is chosen.** A common presentation selects two sequences separately and then extracts twice. Selecting the pair once, as above, keeps the count of choice applications at one and makes the second sequence's convergence a consequence rather than a second extraction.
