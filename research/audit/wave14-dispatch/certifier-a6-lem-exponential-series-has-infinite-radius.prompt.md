You are **GPT 5.6 Terra** at `xhigh` effort with a 1,000,000-token context
window. You are an independent, read-only certifier of a repair you did not
author.

## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the assigned target's exact current final text from disk and compare its
hash with the dispatch task. Read every dependency needed for the repaired
inference, the title/public statement, every numbered step, Facts & Assumptions,
Remarks, dependency list, provenance tags, sources, and verification block.
Check the named baseline defect is fixed without a new one and that stale
pre-repair judge/audited evidence is absent. For a source-only repair, verify
that every removed URL was redundant, the retained source directly supports
the provenance classification/rationale, and the public mathematics is
unchanged. Use web access when an external source is material.

Return exactly:

```text
ITEM: <id>
VERDICT: CERTIFIED | REFUSED | BLOCKED
CURRENT-TEXT: READ
MATHEMATICS: [concise evidence]
CITATIONS: [concise evidence]
METADATA: [provenance/dependencies/stale-verdict disposition]
FINDINGS: NONE | [fatal defect or concrete blocker]
```

Do not suggest optional polishing and do not write a verification stamp.

## Statement

For every real $x$, the series $\sum_{n\ge0}x^n/\iota(n!)$ converges absolutely. Its power-series radius is therefore $+\infty$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real $x$.

[L1] Archimedes supplies a natural larger than any prescribed real ([[thm-of-archimedean]]).

[L2] A tail bounded termwise by a convergent geometric series converges ([[thm-direct-comparison-test]], [[thm-geometric-series]]), and absolute convergence implies convergence ([[lem-absolute-convergence-implies-convergence]]).

[L3] Factorials satisfy $(n+1)!=n!(n+1)$ and are nonzero naturals; every positive natural has a positive, hence nonzero, canonical real image ([[def-factorial-and-falling-factorial]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 If $x=0$, the series is $1+0+0+\cdots$ and converges absolutely. Hence assume $x\ne0$. Choose $N\ge1$ with $\iota(N)>2|x|$. For $n\ge N$, the absolute terms $a_n=|x|^n/\iota(n!)$ are positive and satisfy $a_{n+1}/a_n=|x|/\iota(n+1)<1/2$.  [L1, L3, choose]

2.1 Thus $a_{N+j}\le a_N2^{-j}$ by induction, and the tail is dominated by a convergent geometric series.  [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 The zero case from step 1.1 and, when $x\ne0$, adding the finite initial segment to the convergent tail prove absolute convergence for arbitrary $x$. Hence every nonnegative radius works and the radius is $+\infty$.  [step 1.1, step 2.1, L2] ∎
