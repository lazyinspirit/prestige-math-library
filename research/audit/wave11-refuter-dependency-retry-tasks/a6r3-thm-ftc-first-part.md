## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]), let $F$ be its integral function
([[def-the-integral-function]]), and let $c \in [a,b]$ be a point at which $f$ is
continuous ([[def-continuity-real]]). Then $F$ is differentiable at $c$ as a
function on $[a,b]$ ([[def-derivative]]) and

$$F'(c) \;=\; f(c) .$$

At $c = a$ and $c = b$ this is the one-sided statement, which is what
[[def-derivative]] means at those points: every point of a nondegenerate interval
is a limit point of it, so $F'(c)$ is a meaningful symbol at every $c \in [a,b]$,
and the difference quotient is taken over $[a,b] \setminus \{c\}$.

**Consequently, if $f$ is continuous on the whole of $[a,b]$, then $F$ is a
primitive of $f$ there**: $F' = f$ at every point of $[a,b]$.

**Continuity at $c$ is a hypothesis and it cannot be dropped.** For an integrable
$f$ that is discontinuous at $c$, $F'(c)$ may fail to exist, and it may exist and
differ from $f(c)$; both are exhibited on the companion page, by
an integrable function with no primitive and by a false
statement about the integral function.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, an integrable $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, its integral function $F(x) = \int_a^x f$, a point $c \in [a,b]$ at which $f$ is continuous, and a real $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] $F(x) - F(c) = \int_c^x f$ for all $x, c \in [a,b]$, in either order ([[def-the-integral-function]], [[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]]).

[L2] Continuity at $c$: for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $t \in [a,b]$ with $|t - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|f(t) - f(c)| < \eta$ ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L3] Every point of a nondegenerate interval is a limit point of it, so $F'(c) = \lim_{x\to c} \bigl(F(x)-F(c)\bigr)/(x-c)$ is a meaningful symbol, the limit being taken over $[a,b]\setminus\{c\}$ ([[def-derivative]], [[def-function-limit]], [[def-interval]]).

[L4] For $p < q$ in $[a,b]$: $f$ and $|f|$ and every constant are integrable on $[p,q]$; $\int_p^q \lambda = \lambda(q-p)$; sums and scalar multiples of integrable functions are integrable with the corresponding identity; and $\bigl|\int_p^q u\bigr| \le \int_p^q |u|$ ([[lem-integrability-on-a-subinterval]], [[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]], [[thm-linearity-of-the-integral]], [[cor-integrability-of-absolute-values-products-and-lattice-operations]]).

[L5] If $u \le w$ pointwise on $[p,q]$ and both are integrable then $\int_p^q u \le \int_p^q w$ ([[thm-monotonicity-of-the-integral]]).

[L6] With oriented limits, $\int_q^p u = -\int_p^q u$ and $\int_p^p u = 0$ ([[def-oriented-integral]]).

[L7] Absolute value and ordered-field arithmetic: $|{-t}| = |t|$, $|t\,s| = |t||s|$, $|t| \le c$ follows from $-c \le t \le c$, a positive real has a positive inverse, and the order is total and transitive ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). The nonstrict forms of the order facts follow from the strict ones by adjoining equality.

[L8] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a real $\eta' > 0$ with $\eta' < \eta$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L2] with $\eta := \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$, fix a real $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(t)-f(c)| < \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1}$ for every $t \in [a,b]$ with $|t-c| < \delta$. [given, L2, L7, L8, choose]

1.2 For $x \in [a,b]$ with $x \ne c$, [L1] and [L4] give $F(x) - F(c) - f(c)(x-c) = \int_c^x f - \int_c^x f(c) = \int_c^x \bigl(f(t) - f(c)\bigr)\,\mathrm{d}t$, the constant $f(c)$ having integral $f(c)(x-c)$ over the oriented interval from $c$ to $x$ by [L4] and [L6]. [L1, L4, L6]

2.1 **The estimate for $c < x < c+\delta$.** Every $t \in [c,x]$ has $|t-c| < \delta$, so $-\varepsilon\cdot2^{-1} \le f(t)-f(c) \le \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1}$ there by step 1.1, whence $\bigl|\int_c^x (f - f(c))\bigr| \le \varepsilon\cdot2^{-1}\,(x-c)$ by [L4] and [L5]. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L4, L5, L7]

2.2 **The estimate for $c-\delta < x < c$.** By [L6], $\int_c^x (f-f(c)) = -\int_x^c (f-f(c))$, and every $t \in [x,c]$ has $|t-c| < \delta$, so the same argument gives $\bigl|\int_c^x (f-f(c))\bigr| \le \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1}\,(c-x)$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L4, L5, L6, L7]

3.1 In both cases $\bigl|\int_c^x(f-f(c))\bigr| \le \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1}\,|x-c|$, so dividing by the nonzero $|x-c|$ and using step 1.2 gives $\Bigl|\dfrac{F(x)-F(c)}{x-c} - f(c)\Bigr| \le \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1} < \varepsilon$ for every $x \in [a,b]$ with $0 < |x-c| < \delta$. [step 1.2, step 2.1, step 2.2, L7]

4.1 Since $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary, the limit of the difference quotient of $F$ at $c$ exists and equals $f(c)$ by [L3]; that is, $F'(c) = f(c)$. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L3]

5.1 If $f$ is continuous at every point of $[a,b]$ then step 4.1 applies at every $c \in [a,b]$, so $F' = f$ on $[a,b]$ and $F$ is a primitive of $f$. [step 4.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **The estimate is written out for $x < c$ as well, and that is not redundancy.** For $x < c$ the factor $1/(x-c)$ is negative and the naive chain $m(x-c) \le \int_c^x \le M(x-c)$ reverses; what makes the argument uniform is taking absolute values *before* dividing, which is what steps 2.1, 2.2 and 3.1 do. This is the single most common error in this proof.

- **The route is the definition of the derivative, not the mean value theorem for integrals.** Deducing $F'(c) = f(c)$ from [[thm-first-mean-value-theorem-for-integrals]] would need $f$ continuous on a whole subinterval around $c$, which is a strictly stronger hypothesis than continuity at the single point $c$. The theorem as stated is the sharp one.

- **What is proved at a point is proved at a point.** Nothing here says $F$ is differentiable anywhere else, and nothing says $F' = f$ off the continuity set of $f$. Where $f$ is merely integrable, all that survives is [[thm-the-integral-function-is-lipschitz]].

- **Forward references, orientation only.** The two failures at a discontinuity are worked out on the companion page as [[cex-an-integrable-function-with-no-primitive]] and [[fs-the-integral-function-is-always-a-primitive]]; nothing above depends on either.

Drop the requirement and the implication can be satisfied\n   vacuously by *every* real $L$ at once, which is exactly what\n   [[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]] records. At a point of $A$\n   that is not a limit point of $A$ — an isolated point — the symbol\n   $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x)$ is therefore **not defined** in this library.\n\n2. **$c \\in A$ is not required.** A limit point of $A$ need not belong to $A$\n   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and the definition never evaluates $f$ at $c$. This\n   is what allows a limit to be taken at a point where the function is not\n   defined at all, as at $0$ for $x \\mapsto x\\,\\psi(1/x)$.\n\n3. **The value $f(c)$, when it exists, is irrelevant.** The hypothesis\n   $0 < |x - c|$ excludes $x = c$ from the quantifier, so changing $f$ at the\n   single point $c$ changes nothing. Equality of the limit with the value is an\n   extra condition, not a consequence: [[fs-limit-equals-value]].\n\n**The notation presumes uniqueness.** Writing $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = L$ treats\nthe left-hand side as a name for a single real number, which is legitimate only\nbecause at a limit point at most one $L$ can satisfy the displayed condition.\nThat obligation is discharged by [[lem-function-limit-unique]], recorded in this\nitem's `justified_by`. As with $\\sup S$ ([[rem-sup-conventions]]) and\n$\\lim_k x_k$ ([[lem-limit-unique]]), the symbol is written only for a function\nalready known to have a limit at $c$.\n\n**Real and rational $\\varepsilon$ define the same relation.** Above,\n$\\varepsilon$ and $\\delta$ range over the positive reals. Restricting either\nquantifier to the positive rationals gives the same relation: every positive\nrational is a positive real, and below every positive real lies a positive\nrational ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), so an $\\varepsilon$-condition verified for\nall positive rationals is verified for an arbitrary positive real $\\eta$ by\nrunning it at a rational $\\varepsilon$ with $0 < \\varepsilon < \\eta$, and a\n$\\delta$ produced as a real may be shrunk to a rational one below it. This is\nthe passage sanctioned in the remarks of [[def-sequence]], and it is what lets\nthis definition be compared with [[def-real-limit]], whose $\\varepsilon$ is\nrational, in [[thm-sequential-criterion-for-function-limits]].",

It holds because\n$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to\nboth sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside\n$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.\n\n**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \\le b$, which is\nexactly the condition making them nonempty.

## Statement refuted

**False claim:** every Riemann integrable function on a closed bounded interval
has a primitive there, that is, is the derivative of some function on that
interval.

Let $s : [-1,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ be the sign function,

$$s(x) \;:=\; \begin{cases} -1 & -1 \le x < 0, \\ 0 & x = 0, \\ 1 & 0 < x \le 1. \end{cases}$$

Then $s$ is Riemann integrable on $[-1,1]$ with $\int_{-1}^{1} s = 0$, and there
is **no** $G : [-1,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ differentiable at every point of $[-1,1]$
with $G' = s$.

**The integral function of $s$ is $F(x) = |x| - 1$**, which is differentiable at
every point of $[-1,1]$ except $x = 0$ — exactly the one point where $s$ is
discontinuous. That is consistent with [[thm-ftc-first-part]], which claims
$F'(c) = s(c)$ only at points of continuity of $s$, and it is what the refutation
below turns into a contradiction.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The sign function $s$ on $[-1,1]$ and its integral function $F(x) = \int_{-1}^{x} s$.

[A1] There is $G : [-1,1] \to \mathbb{R}$, differentiable at every point of $[-1,1]$ as a function on $[-1,1]$, with $G'(x) = s(x)$ for every $x \in [-1,1]$.

[L1] A bounded function on $[p,q]$ with at most finitely many discontinuities is Riemann integrable there ([[thm-finitely-many-discontinuities-integrable]], [[def-bounded-set]], [[def-darboux-integral]], [[def-classification-of-discontinuities]]).

[L2] Changing an integrable function at finitely many points changes neither its integrability nor its integral, and $\int_p^q c = c(q-p)$ for a constant ([[lem-changing-a-function-at-finitely-many-points]], [[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]]).

[L3] Additivity, in the oriented form valid for arbitrary points ([[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]], claim 3, [[def-oriented-integral]], [[def-the-integral-function]]).

[L4] If $u$ is continuous on an order-convex $I$ and differentiable with $u' = 0$ at every interior point of $I$, then $u$ is constant on $I$ ([[cor-zero-derivative-implies-constant]], [[def-interval]]).

[L5] A function differentiable at a point is continuous there, and a restriction to a subinterval still having the point as a limit point is differentiable there with the same derivative; every point of a nondegenerate interval is a limit point of it ([[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]], [[def-derivative]], [[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L6] If both one-sided limits of a function at $c$ exist and differ, the two-sided limit does not exist ([[thm-two-sided-limit-iff-both-one-sided]], [[def-one-sided-limits]], [[def-function-limit]]).

[L7] Absolute value: $|x| = x$ for $x \ge 0$ and $|x| = -x$ for $x \le 0$; $|x|/x = 1$ for $x>0$ and $= -1$ for $x<0$ ([[def-abs-value]], [[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 $s$ is bounded, with $|s| \le 1$, and continuous at every point of $[-1,1]$ other than $0$: near a point $x \ne 0$ it is locally constant. So $s$ is integrable on $[-1,1]$, and likewise on $[-1,0]$ and on $[0,1]$, by [L1]. [given, L1]

1.2 **Assume [A1].** Then $G' = s$ everywhere on $[-1,1]$. [assume-contra, A1]

2.1 On $[-1,0]$ the function $s$ agrees with the constant $-1$ except at the single point $0$, so $\int_{-1}^{0} s = -1\cdot(0-(-1)) = -1$ by [L2]; on $[0,1]$ it agrees with the constant $1$ except at $0$, so $\int_0^1 s = 1$. [step 1.1, L2]

2.2 On $I_{+} := [0,1]$ the function $u_{+}(x) := G(x) - x$ is continuous, by [L5], and differentiable at every interior point $x \in (0,1)$ with $u_{+}'(x) = s(x) - 1 = 0$; so $u_{+}$ is constant on $[0,1]$ by [L4], say $G(x) = x + c_1$ there. [step 1.2, L4, L5, choose]

2.3 On $I_{-} := [-1,0]$ the function $u_{-}(x) := G(x) + x$ is continuous and differentiable at every $x \in (-1,0)$ with $u_{-}'(x) = s(x)+1 = 0$; so $G(x) = -x + c_2$ on $[-1,0]$. [step 1.2, L4, L5, choose]

3.1 By [L3], $\int_{-1}^{1} s = \int_{-1}^{0} s + \int_0^1 s = -1 + 1 = 0$. [step 2.1, L3]

3.2 By [L3] again, $F(x) = \int_{-1}^{x} s$ equals $-1 + x$ for $x \in [0,1]$ and equals $-(x-(-1)) = -x-1$ for $x \in [-1,0]$, by [L2] applied on the relevant piece; in both cases $F(x) = |x| - 1$ by [L7]. [step 2.1, L2, L3, L7]

3.3 Evaluating both formulas at $x = 0$ gives $c_1 = G(0) = c_2$; write $c$ for the common value, so $G(x) = |x| + c$ for every $x \in [-1,1]$ by [L7]. [step 2.2, step 2.3, L7]

4.1 The difference quotient of $G$ at $0$ is $x \mapsto (G(x)-G(0))/x = |x|/x$, which equals $1$ for $x > 0$ and $-1$ for $x < 0$ by [L7]; so its right-hand limit at $0$ is $1$ and its left-hand limit is $-1$. [step 3.3, L7]

5.1 By [L6] the two-sided limit of that quotient at $0$ does not exist, so $G$ is not differentiable at $0$; this contradicts [A1]. [step 4.1, A1, L6]

6.1 Hence no such $G$ exists: $s$ is integrable on $[-1,1]$ by step 1.1 and has no primitive there, so the claim is false. [step 1.1, step 3.1, step 5.1, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Darboux's theorem is not used.** The slick argument — a derivative has the intermediate value property, and $s$ does not — rests on Darboux's theorem on the intermediate value property of derivatives. The refutation above uses only [[cor-zero-derivative-implies-constant]] and the one-sided limits of a difference quotient, both already published.

- **The tension with the first fundamental theorem is only apparent.** $F$ *is* differentiable with $F' = s$ at every point of $[-1,1]$ except $0$, which is exactly what [[thm-ftc-first-part]] promises, since $s$ is continuous exactly off $0$. What fails is the existence of *any* function differentiable at $0$ too with derivative $s(0)$ there, and step 4.1 shows the obstruction is the jump of $s$ at $0$, not a defect of $F$.

- **The value $s(0)$ is irrelevant to both halves.** Changing it changes neither the integral, by [[lem-changing-a-function-at-finitely-many-points]], nor the conclusion of step 5.1, which shows $G$ is not differentiable at $0$ at all and therefore cannot have any prescribed derivative there.

## Statement

Let $F$ be a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and let
$\varepsilon \in F$ with $\varepsilon > 0$. Then there is a natural number
$n \ge 1$ such that

$$\frac{1}{n \cdot 1_F} < \varepsilon ,$$

where $n \cdot 1_F$ is the canonical natural of $F$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]]) and
$1/(n \cdot 1_F)$ is its multiplicative inverse ([[def-field]]). As is standard
we abbreviate $n \cdot 1_F$ to $n$ and write the conclusion $1/n < \varepsilon$.

This is the **reciprocal form** of the Archimedean property.
[[thm-of-archimedean]] on its own delivers only the assertion that the canonical
naturals are cofinal, $x < n \cdot 1_F$; the form actually used in analysis, that
the reciprocals of the naturals get below every positive bound, is the statement
above, and it is recorded separately so that no proof has to reconstruct the
inversion step in passing.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $F$ and an element $\varepsilon \in F$ with $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] Archimedean property: for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Inverses and order: if $a > 0$ then $a^{-1} > 0$, and if $0 < a < b$ then $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Field arithmetic: an element $a$ with $a > 0$ is nonzero by trichotomy, hence has a multiplicative inverse $a^{-1}$, and $(a^{-1})^{-1} = a$ ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Since $\varepsilon > 0$, trichotomy gives $\varepsilon \ne 0$, so $\varepsilon^{-1}$ exists, and $\varepsilon^{-1} > 0$. [given, L2, L3]

2.1 Apply [L1] to $x = \varepsilon^{-1}$: fix a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $\varepsilon^{-1} < n \cdot 1_F$. [step 1.1, L1, choose]

3.1 Chaining the two displayed inequalities gives $0 < \varepsilon^{-1} < n \cdot 1_F$; in particular $n \cdot 1_F > 0$, so $n \cdot 1_F \ne 0$ and $1/(n \cdot 1_F)$ is defined. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L3]

4.1 Apply the second claim of [L2] with $a = \varepsilon^{-1}$ and $b = n \cdot 1_F$: $0 < (n \cdot 1_F)^{-1} < (\varepsilon^{-1})^{-1}$. [step 3.1, L2]

5.1 By [L3], $(\varepsilon^{-1})^{-1} = \varepsilon$, so the natural number $n \ge 1$ fixed in step 2.1 satisfies $1/(n \cdot 1_F) < \varepsilon$, which is the assertion. [step 4.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Monotonicity gives the eventual form for free.** If $m \ge n \ge 1$ then
  $m \cdot 1_F \ge n \cdot 1_F > 0$, because $k \mapsto k \cdot 1_F$ is strictly
  increasing on the naturals $\ge 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]), and so
  $1/(m \cdot 1_F) \le 1/(n \cdot 1_F) < \varepsilon$ by [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]
  again. So the corollary yields not merely one index but a threshold: every
  $m \ge n$ satisfies $1/m < \varepsilon$. That one extra line is what a
  convergence proof needs, and it is left to the caller rather than folded into
  the statement, because the caller usually has a threshold of its own to combine
  it with.

- **Completeness is used only through [[thm-of-archimedean]].** Nothing here
  needs the least-upper-bound property directly. The corollary therefore holds
  verbatim in any Archimedean ordered field, in particular in $\mathbb{Q}$, and
  it fails in a non-Archimedean ordered field, where an infinitesimal
  $\varepsilon > 0$ is below every $1/n$ by construction.

- The equivalence is exact: the reciprocal form implies the cofinal form back
  again, since given $x > 0$ one applies it to $\varepsilon = 1/x$. The two are
  the same property written on the two sides of the inversion, and only the
  direction proved above is used in this library.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]). Then:

1. $|f|$, $f^{2}$ and $fg$ are integrable on $[a,b]$
   ([[def-abs-value]], [[def-integer-power]]);
2. $\max(f,g)$ and $\min(f,g)$, defined pointwise
   ([[def-max-min]]), are integrable on $[a,b]$;
3. the **triangle inequality for the integral**:
   $$\Bigl|\int_a^b f\Bigr| \;\le\; \int_a^b |f| .$$

**Claim 3 is stated with $a < b$ and is not orientation-invariant.** For $u > v$
the right-hand side is $-\int_v^u |f| \le 0$ while the left-hand side is $\ge 0$,
so the inequality as written is false there. The form valid for *every* pair
$u,v$ on which $f$ is integrable ([[def-oriented-integral]]) is

$$\Bigl|\int_u^v f\Bigr| \;\le\; \Bigl|\int_u^v |f|\,\Bigr| ,$$

and that is the form the estimates below on this page use whenever the limits
are not known to be in increasing order.

**The converse of claim 1 fails.** Integrability of $|f|$ does not give
integrability of $f$; the witness is on the companion page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and integrable $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] If $u$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ with values in $[m,M]$ and $\varphi$ is continuous on $[m,M]$, then $\varphi\circ u$ is integrable ([[thm-composition-with-a-continuous-function]]); an integrable function is bounded, so such $m$ and $M$ exist ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-bounded-set]], [[def-interval]]).

[L2] Sums and scalar multiples of integrable functions are integrable, with $\int_a^b(\lambda u + \nu w) = \lambda\int_a^b u + \nu\int_a^b w$ ([[thm-linearity-of-the-integral]]).

[L3] If $u \le w$ pointwise on $[a,b]$ and both are integrable then $\int_a^b u \le \int_a^b w$ ([[thm-monotonicity-of-the-integral]]).

[L4] The absolute value $t \mapsto |t|$, the square $t \mapsto t^{2}$ and every polynomial function are continuous on every subset of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], claims 2 and 5, [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L5] For reals $s,t$: $\max\{s,t\} = (s + t + |s-t|)\cdot 2^{-1}$ and $\min\{s,t\} = (s + t - |s-t|)\cdot 2^{-1}$, and $st = \bigl((s+t)^{2} - (s-t)^{2}\bigr)\cdot 4^{-1}$ ([[def-max-min]], [[def-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L6] Absolute value: $-|t| \le t \le |t|$, and $|t| \le c$ follows from $-c \le t \le c$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]]).

[L7] With oriented limits, $\int_v^u u = -\int_u^v u$ and $\int_u^u u = 0$ ([[def-oriented-integral]]).

[L8] Ordered-field arithmetic: adding constants and multiplying by positive reals preserve inequalities, and the order is total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $f$ is bounded, so fix reals $m \le M$ with $f[\,[a,b]\,] \subseteq [m,M]$; the same for $g$, and for $f+g$ and $f-g$, which are integrable by [L2]. [given, L1, L2, choose]

1.2 The maps $t \mapsto |t|$ and $t \mapsto t^{2}$ are continuous on any closed bounded interval, by [L4]. [L4]

2.1 By [L1] applied with $\varphi(t) = |t|$ to $f$, to $g$ and to $f-g$, the functions $|f|$, $|g|$ and $|f-g|$ are integrable. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1]

2.2 By [L1] applied with $\varphi(t) = t^{2}$ to $f$, to $f+g$ and to $f-g$, the functions $f^{2}$, $(f+g)^{2}$ and $(f-g)^{2}$ are integrable. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1]

3.1 By [L5], $fg = \bigl((f+g)^{2}-(f-g)^{2}\bigr)\cdot 4^{-1}$ pointwise, so $fg$ is integrable by [L2]; this completes claim 1. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L2, L5]

3.2 By [L5], $\max(f,g) = \bigl(f + g + |f-g|\bigr)\cdot 2^{-1}$ and $\min(f,g) = \bigl(f+g-|f-g|\bigr)\cdot 2^{-1}$ pointwise, so both are integrable by [L2]; this is claim 2. [step 2.1, L2, L5]

3.3 **Claim 3.** By [L6], $-|f| \le f \le |f|$ pointwise on $[a,b]$, and all three functions are integrable by step 2.1 and [L2]. [step 2.1, L2, L6]

4.1 By [L3] applied twice, $-\int_a^b|f| \le \int_a^b f \le \int_a^b |f|$, using $\int_a^b(-|f|) = -\int_a^b|f|$ from [L2]. [step 3.3, L2, L3]

5.1 Hence $\bigl|\int_a^b f\bigr| \le \int_a^b|f|$ by [L6], which is claim 3. [step 4.1, L6]

6.1 **The oriented form.** For $u = v$ both sides are $0$ by [L7]; for $u < v$ it is claim 3 on $[u,v]$; and for $u > v$ both $\int_u^v f$ and $\int_u^v |f|$ are the negatives of the corresponding integrals over $[v,u]$ by [L7], so the two absolute values are unchanged and claim 3 on $[v,u]$ gives the inequality. [step 5.1, L7, L8] ∎

## Remarks

- **Every integrability clause comes from one theorem plus linearity.** The only input that produces integrability is [[thm-composition-with-a-continuous-function]], with [[thm-linearity-of-the-integral]] recombining the pieces; claim 3 additionally uses [[thm-monotonicity-of-the-integral]], which is the one place an inequality between integrals is needed. The identities of [L5] are algebra, and they are what turns a statement about composing with $|\cdot|$ and $(\cdot)^2$ into statements about products and lattice operations. In particular no new estimate on Darboux sums is made here.

- **The polarisation identity is used, and it is why $f^2$ comes first.** There is no direct route from integrability of $f$ and of $g$ to integrability of $fg$ through the composition theorem, because $(s,t) \mapsto st$ is a function of two variables and the theorem composes with one. Writing $fg$ through squares of sums and differences reduces it to the one-variable case.

- **The inequality of claim 3 is the integral analogue of the triangle inequality**, and like it, it can be strict: for $f(x) = x$ on $[-1,1]$ the left-hand side is $0$ and the right-hand side is $1$.

- **Forward reference, orientation only.** The witness refuting the converse of claim 1 is [[cex-absolute-value-integrable-without-the-function]] on the companion page; nothing above depends on it.

## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq F$.

- $u \in F$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$; $S$ is
  **bounded above** if it has an upper bound.
- $u \in F$ is a **least upper bound** (or **supremum**, $\sup S$) of $S$ if $u$
  is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le u'$ for every upper bound $u'$ of $S$.

$F$ is a **complete ordered field** (equivalently, $F$ has the
**least-upper-bound property**, or is **Dedekind complete**) if every nonempty
$S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$.

## Remarks

- A least upper bound, if it exists, is unique (two least upper bounds are each
  $\le$ the other, so equal by antisymmetry of the order).
- Applying the property to $\{-s : s \in S\}$ yields the dual **greatest lower
  bound** (infimum) property, so the two are equivalent.
- The Dedekind-cut reals have this property by construction
  ([[thm-dedekind-complete]]); the Cauchy-sequence reals acquire it via
  [[cor-cauchy-reals-lub-complete]]. This definition is the target for the

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field with its order and
absolute value ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]), and
neighbourhoods are those of [[def-neighbourhood-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Then
$f$ is **continuous at $c$** when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

with $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ ranging over the **positive reals**. In the
language of neighbourhoods: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ with

$$f\bigl(A \cap N_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \;\subseteq\; N_{\varepsilon}\bigl(f(c)\bigr).$$

$f$ is **continuous on $A$** when it is continuous at every point of $A$.

**The point $c$ is required to lie in $A$, and the condition is unpunctured.**
Both differ from [[def-function-limit]], and deliberately. There the quantifier
runs over $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, which removes $x = c$; here $x = c$ is allowed,
and at $x = c$ the implication reads $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$, which is
automatic. So allowing $x = c$ costs nothing, and it is what lets the definition
be stated at every point of $A$, including the points where no limit exists.

**Three clauses, and all three are part of the definition.**

1. **At a limit point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is a limit point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]). Then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if the
   limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) \;=\; f(c)$$
   ([[def-function-limit]]). Indeed, for a given $\varepsilon > 0$ a $\delta$
   witnessing continuity witnesses the limit condition, because the limit
   condition quantifies over a subset of the points continuity quantifies over;
   and conversely a $\delta$ witnessing $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$ witnesses
   continuity, because the one point it omits, $x = c$, satisfies
   $|f(c) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ anyway.

2. **At an isolated point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is an isolated point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so that $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ for some real
   $\eta > 0$. Then **every** $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$: take
   $\delta := \eta$, so that the only $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ is $c$
   itself, and $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$.

3. **On a set.** Continuity on $A$ is continuity at each point of $A$, and
   nothing more. It is not a condition relating $f$ to points outside $A$.

Every point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$,
and never both ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so clauses 1 and 2 between them describe
continuity at every point of $A$.

**This is not the raw $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula of
[[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]].** That item records what goes
wrong when the *punctured* formula of [[def-function-limit]] is written down at
an arbitrary point of the domain: at an isolated point it is satisfied
vacuously by every real $L$ at once, so it defines nothing, and this library
therefore leaves $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ **undefined** at an isolated point.
Continuity at an isolated point is a different matter: the formula above is not
vacuous — it is a genuine condition on $f(c)$, satisfied because $f(c)$ is the
only value being compared with itself — and it names a single, well-defined
property. The limit is undefined there; the continuity is defined, and is
automatic. Clause 1 is the only place where the two notions meet, and it is
stated only where the limit exists as a notion.

**Where the distinction disappears.** If $A$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), then every $c \in A$ has some
$N_{\eta}(c) \subseteq A$, and a punctured neighbourhood is never empty
([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), so every point of $A$ is a limit point of $A$ and
clause 1 covers the whole of $A$. The same holds when $A$ is a nondegenerate
interval ([[def-interval]]). Isolated points are what force clause 2 to exist at
all, and they occur as soon as $A$ is allowed to be an arbitrary subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, as in $A = \{0\} \cup [1,2]$.

## Remarks

- **Continuity is local.** If $\eta > 0$ and $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agrees with
  $f$ on $A \cap N_{\eta}(c)$, then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if $g$
  is: any $\delta$ may be replaced by $\min\{\delta, \eta\}$, after which the
  condition only ever evaluates the two functions where they agree. So
  continuity at $c$ sees only an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of $c$, exactly
  as the limit does ([[lem-limit-is-local]]).

- **Continuity passes to subsets of the domain.** If $B \subseteq A$ and
  $c \in B$, then continuity of $f$ at $c$ gives continuity of the restriction
  $f|_B$ at $c$, with the same $\delta$: the condition on $f|_B$ quantifies over
  fewer points. The converse fails, and the standard witness is the indicator of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ restricted to $\mathbb{Q}$, which is constant and hence
  continuous, while the indicator itself is continuous nowhere
  ([[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]]).

- **The radius is a real number.** As in [[def-neighbourhood-r]], $\varepsilon$
  and $\delta$ range over the positive reals here. Restricting either quantifier
  to the positive rationals defines the same relation, by the passage recorded
  in [[def-function-limit]]: below every positive real lies a positive rational
  ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and a real $\delta$ may be shrunk to a rational
  one below it.

- **The word *continuous* is used for two things in this library, and they
  agree.** [[def-metric-continuity]] defines continuity of a map between metric
  spaces, and $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ carries the metric $d(x,y) = |x-y|$. The
  two notions coincide, and that is proved, not assumed:
  [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]] is the dictionary, and it is stated on
  this page precisely so that no later item has to guess.

## Definition

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]). Write $\mathcal{P}$ for the set of all partitions of
$[a,b]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]) and put

$$\mathcal{L} \;:=\; \{\, L(f,P) \ : \ P \in \mathcal{P} \,\}, \qquad \mathcal{U} \;:=\; \{\, U(f,P) \ : \ P \in \mathcal{P} \,\}$$

for the sets of lower and of upper Darboux sums ([[def-darboux-sums]]).

### Both extrema exist

**$\mathcal{P}$ is nonempty**: the pair $(1, t)$ with $t_0 := a$ and $t_k := b$
for $k \ge 1$ is a partition of $[a,b]$, since $a < b$. So $\mathcal{L}$ and
$\mathcal{U}$ are nonempty.

**$\mathcal{L}$ is bounded above and $\mathcal{U}$ is bounded below.** Fix any
$Q \in \mathcal{P}$. By claim 2 of [[lem-refinement-inequalities]],
$L(f,P) \le U(f,Q)$ for every $P \in \mathcal{P}$, so $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound
of $\mathcal{L}$; and $L(f,Q) \le U(f,P)$ for every $P$, so $L(f,Q)$ is a lower
bound of $\mathcal{U}$.

Hence a nonempty set bounded above has a supremum
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and a nonempty set bounded below has an infimum
([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]), each unique ([[lem-sup-unique]]).
The **lower** and **upper Darboux integrals** of $f$ over $[a,b]$ are the real
numbers

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;:=\; \sup \mathcal{L} \;=\; \sup_{P} L(f,P), \qquad \overline{\int_a^b} f \;:=\; \inf \mathcal{U} \;=\; \inf_{P} U(f,P) .$$

### The lower integral never exceeds the upper one

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f .$$

Indeed, for each fixed $Q \in \mathcal{P}$ the number $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound
of $\mathcal{L}$, so the least upper bound satisfies
$\underline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,Q)$. As $Q$ was arbitrary, $\underline{\int_a^b}f$
is a lower bound of $\mathcal{U}$, and the greatest lower bound satisfies
$\underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f$ ([[def-infimum]]).

Moreover, for **every** partition $P$,

$$L(f,P) \;\le\; \underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; U(f,P) ,$$

the outer inequalities because a member of a set is at most its supremum and at
least its infimum.

### Integrability

$f$ is **Darboux integrable on $[a,b]$**, and on this page simply
**integrable**, when

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;=\; \overline{\int_a^b} f ,$$

and then the common value is written

$$\int_a^b f \qquad \text{or} \qquad \int_a^b f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x ,$$

the **integral of $f$ over $[a,b]$**. It is a single well-determined real
number, being the common value of two numbers each of which is unique
([[lem-sup-unique]]). Without the displayed equality the symbol $\int_a^b f$ is
not defined and is never written.

**The inequality above is the whole difficulty.** By the previous paragraph
integrability is *never* a question of one integral exceeding the other, only of
the gap $\overline{\int_a^b} f - \underline{\int_a^b} f \ge 0$ being $0$; and by
[[thm-riemann-criterion]] that gap is $0$ exactly when a single partition can be
found making $U(f,P) - L(f,P)$ small. Whether that is possible is settled
completely, in terms of the discontinuities of $f$, by
[[thm-lebesgue-criterion]].

**"Riemann integrable" means the same thing here.** The definition above is
Darboux's. Riemann's own definition, in terms of tagged partitions of small
mesh, is [[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]], and the two define the same
class of functions with the same integral by [[thm-darboux-equals-riemann]].
Until that theorem is proved the two phrases are kept apart; after it they are
used interchangeably, as they are throughout the literature.

## Remarks

- **The supremum is over all partitions, and nothing is selected.** Both
  $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{U}$ are sets determined by $f$ and $[a,b]$ alone,
  and $\sup$ and $\inf$ are canonical, so no choice principle is involved in
  forming either integral. Where a choice does enter on this page is recorded in
  [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].

- **Why the lower integral is a supremum and not an infimum.** Refining a
  partition can only increase a lower sum and decrease an upper sum
  ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]]), so the lower sums push up towards the
  integral and the upper sums push down towards it. Taking $\inf \mathcal{L}$
  would return the sum over the coarsest partition and would carry no
  information about $f$ beyond its infimum on $[a,b]$.

- **A bounded $f$ always has both integrals; only their equality can fail.** The
  Dirichlet function on $[0,1]$ has lower integral $0$ and upper integral $1$
  ([[fs-bounded-implies-riemann-integrable]]), which is the standard witness that
  the definition above is not vacuous in either direction.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), neighbourhoods are those of
[[def-neighbourhood-r]] and limit points those of [[def-limit-point-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$ be a
**limit point of $A$**. The **difference quotient of $f$ at $c$** is the function

$$q_{f,c} : A \setminus \{c\} \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad q_{f,c}(x) := \frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c} .$$

The division is legitimate at every point of the domain, since $x \ne c$ gives
$x - c \ne 0$.

**The point $c$ is a limit point of $A \setminus \{c\}$, not merely of $A$.**
For every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the punctured neighbourhood
$N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c)$ omits $c$, so

$$N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c) \cap A \;=\; N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c) \cap (A \setminus \{c\}) ,$$

and the left-hand side is nonempty because $c$ is a limit point of $A$. So
$q_{f,c}$ is a function on a set having $c$ as a limit point, and
$\lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x)$ is a notion that [[def-function-limit]] defines.

$f$ is **differentiable at $c$** when that limit exists, and then the
**derivative of $f$ at $c$** is

$$f'(c) \;:=\; \lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x) \;=\; \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c} .$$

**Two obligations are carried by that notation, and both are discharged here.**

1. **Uniqueness.** Writing $f'(c)$ treats the right-hand side as a name for a
   single real number. That is legitimate: $c$ is a limit point of the domain
   $A \setminus \{c\}$ of $q_{f,c}$, so at most one real can satisfy the
   $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ condition, by [[lem-function-limit-unique]] applied to
   $q_{f,c}$. Two reals both meeting the condition are therefore equal, and the
   symbol denotes.
2. **Meaningfulness.** The hypothesis that $c$ is a limit point of $A$ is not
   decoration. At an **isolated** point of $A$ the punctured condition
   $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ is met by no point of the domain at all, so the
   $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula is satisfied vacuously by *every* real at
   once; this is why [[def-function-limit]] leaves the limit undefined there,
   and it is why this library defines $f'(c)$ only at a limit point of $A$. At
   an isolated point of its domain a function is neither differentiable nor
   non-differentiable here: the question is not posed.

**The limit sees only $A \setminus \{c\}$, so how the difference quotient is
extended to $c$ is irrelevant.** Let $Q : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agree with
$q_{f,c}$ at every point of $A \setminus \{c\}$, and let $L \in \mathbb{R}$.
Then $\lim_{x \to c} Q(x) = L$ if and only if $\lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x) = L$.
Both conditions read: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ such that every point $x$ of the relevant domain with
$0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|{\cdot} - L| < \varepsilon$
([[def-function-limit]]). The clause $0 < |x - c|$ removes $x = c$ from both
quantifiers, so in both cases the points quantified over are exactly the
$x \in A \setminus \{c\}$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, at which $Q$ and
$q_{f,c}$ take the same value. The two conditions are the same condition.

**Differentiability on a set.** For $S \subseteq A$, $f$ is **differentiable on
$S$** when it is differentiable at every $c \in S$; implicit in that phrase is
that every point of $S$ is a limit point of $A$. $f$ is **differentiable** when
it is differentiable on the whole of $A$.

**Restriction of the domain.** Let $B \subseteq A$, let $c \in B$ and suppose
$c$ is a limit point of $B$. If $f$ is differentiable at $c$, then so is the
restriction $f|_B : B \to \mathbb{R}$, and

$$(f|_B)'(c) \;=\; f'(c) .$$

Indeed $B \setminus \{c\} \subseteq A \setminus \{c\}$; the displayed identity
of punctured neighbourhoods above, applied to $B$, shows that $c$ is a limit
point of $B \setminus \{c\}$; the difference quotient $q_{f|_B, c}$ is the
restriction of $q_{f,c}$ to $B \setminus \{c\}$, since $f|_B(c) = f(c)$; and
claim 2 of [[lem-limit-is-local]] carries the limit to that restriction.

**Every point of a nondegenerate interval is a limit point of it.** Let
$J \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be order-convex ([[def-interval]]) with at least two
elements and let $p \in J$. Choose $q \in J$ with $q \ne p$, and let a real
$\varepsilon > 0$ be given. If $p < q$, put $y := p + \tfrac{1}{2}\min\{\varepsilon,\ q - p\}$;
then $p < y$, and $y - p \le \tfrac{1}{2}(q-p) < q - p$, so $p < y < q$ and
order-convexity gives $y \in J$, while $0 < |y - p| < \varepsilon$. If $q < p$,
the point $y := p - \tfrac{1}{2}\min\{\varepsilon,\ p - q\}$ serves in the same
way. So $N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(p) \cap J \ne \varnothing$ for every real
$\varepsilon > 0$, that is, $p$ is a limit point of $J$
([[def-limit-point-r]]).

Consequently, for $f$ defined on a nondegenerate interval $I$, the symbol
$f'(c)$ is meaningful at **every** $c \in I$, endpoints included. At an endpoint
the difference quotient is taken over the points of $I$ lying on the one side
that is available, so what other texts call a one-sided derivative is, here,
simply the derivative of $f$ on $I$.

## Remarks

- **Notation.** $f'(c)$ and $\frac{df}{dx}(c)$ denote the same real number, and
  this library uses the first. Neither is an operation performed on a symbol
  $x$: the variable in the second is a name for the argument and nothing more.

- **Differentiability is a property of the pair $(f, A)$ at $c$, not of $f$
  alone.** The restriction clause above goes in one direction only, and the
  converse fails. Take $A := \mathbb{R}$, $f(x) := |x|$, $B := [0,\infty)$ and
  $c := 0$. Then $f|_B$ is the identity on $B$, whose difference quotient at $0$
  is constantly $1$, so $f|_B$ is differentiable at $0$ with derivative $1$;
  that $f$ itself is not differentiable at $0$ is
  [[cex-absolute-value-is-not-differentiable-at-zero]] on the companion page.
  So enlarging the domain can destroy differentiability, and the phrase
  "$f$ is differentiable at $c$" always carries the domain with it.

- **The relation to continuity is not definitional.** [[def-continuity-real]]
  is a condition on $f$ near $c$ that does not mention a quotient, and it is
  defined at every point of $A$, isolated points included, whereas
  differentiability is defined only at limit points of $A$. That
  differentiability implies continuity is a theorem on this page and not a
  reading of the definitions.

- **No second derivative and no one-sided derivative is introduced here.**
  Both are standard, and both are absent from this page on purpose;
  [[rem-derivative-conventions]] records exactly what is fixed and what is left
  open at this point in the reading order.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) with its order and absolute value
([[def-real-order]]).

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$, let $c \in \mathbb{R}$
be a **limit point** of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and let $L \in \mathbb{R}$.
We say that **$f(x)$ tends to $L$ as $x$ tends to $c$**, and write

$$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L ,$$

when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ 0 < |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - L| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

where $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ range over the **positive reals**.

In the language of neighbourhoods ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]) the condition reads:
for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ with

$$f\bigl(A \cap N^{*}_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \;\subseteq\; N_{\varepsilon}(L),$$

$N^{*}_{\delta}(c) = \{\, y : 0 < |y - c| < \delta \,\}$ being the punctured
$\delta$-neighbourhood of $c$ and $N_{\varepsilon}(L) = (L - \varepsilon,\ L +
\varepsilon)$ the open interval of [[def-interval]]. The two forms agree because
$|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ says exactly $f(x) \in N_\varepsilon(L)$, and
$0 < |x - c| < \delta$ says exactly $x \in N^{*}_\delta(c)$.

**Three features of this definition are load bearing, not decoration.**

1. **$c$ is required to be a limit point of $A$.** By [[def-limit-point-r]] that
   says every punctured neighbourhood of $c$ meets $A$, so for every $\delta > 0$
   the set $A \cap N^{*}_\delta(c)$ over which the implication quantifies is
   nonempty. Drop the requirement and the implication can be satisfied
   vacuously by *every* real $L$ at once, which is exactly what
   [[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]] records. At a point of $A$
   that is not a limit point of $A$ — an isolated point — the symbol
   $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ is therefore **not defined** in this library.

2. **$c \in A$ is not required.** A limit point of $A$ need not belong to $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and the definition never evaluates $f$ at $c$. This
   is what allows a limit to be taken at a point where the function is not
   defined at all, as at $0$ for $x \mapsto x\,\psi(1/x)$.

3. **The value $f(c)$, when it exists, is irrelevant.** The hypothesis
   $0 < |x - c|$ excludes $x = c$ from the quantifier, so changing $f$ at the
   single point $c$ changes nothing. Equality of the limit with the value is an
   extra condition, not a consequence: [[fs-limit-equals-value]].

**The notation presumes uniqueness.** Writing $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$ treats
the left-hand side as a name for a single real number, which is legitimate only
because at a limit point at most one $L$ can satisfy the displayed condition.
That obligation is discharged by [[lem-function-limit-unique]], recorded in this
item's `justified_by`. As with $\sup S$ ([[rem-sup-conventions]]) and
$\lim_k x_k$ ([[lem-limit-unique]]), the symbol is written only for a function
already known to have a limit at $c$.

**Real and rational $\varepsilon$ define the same relation.** Above,
$\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ range over the positive reals. Restricting either
quantifier to the positive rationals gives the same relation: every positive
rational is a positive real, and below every positive real lies a positive
rational ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), so an $\varepsilon$-condition verified for
all positive rationals is verified for an arbitrary positive real $\eta$ by
running it at a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, and a
$\delta$ produced as a real may be shrunk to a rational one below it. This is
the passage sanctioned in the remarks of [[def-sequence]], and it is what lets
this definition be compared with [[def-real-limit]], whose $\varepsilon$ is
rational, in [[thm-sequential-criterion-for-function-limits]].

## Remarks

- **Terminology.** *Limit point* here is a property of the set $A$ and the point
  $c$, in the sense of [[def-limit-point-r]]; it has nothing to do with
  subsequential limits ([[def-subsequential-limit]]), and the distinction is the
  one that item records.

- **Why the punctured condition, and not $|x - c| < \delta$.** With the
  unpunctured condition the definition would force $f$ to be defined at $c$ and
  would force $|f(c) - L| < \varepsilon$ for every $\varepsilon$, that is,
  $L = f(c)$. The resulting notion is continuity at $c$, a strictly stronger
  condition, and conflating the two is the error catalogued in
  [[fs-limit-equals-value]].

- **One-sided and infinite variants.** Restricting the domain to one side of $c$
  gives the one-sided limits of [[def-one-sided-limits]]; replacing the
  conditions on $x$ or on $f(x)$ by unboundedness conditions gives the limits at
  and to infinity of [[def-limits-at-infinity]]. Both are built on this
  definition rather than beside it.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ ([[def-field]]) together with a subset
$P \subseteq F$, the set of **positive** elements (the *positive cone*),
satisfying:

- **(O1) Trichotomy.** For each $x \in F$, exactly one of the following holds:
  $x \in P$, or $x = 0$, or $-x \in P$.
- **(O2) Closure.** If $x, y \in P$ then $x + y \in P$ and $x \cdot y \in P$.

We write $x > 0$ for $x \in P$ (read "$x$ is positive"), and define the order by

$$a < b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; b - a \in P, \qquad a \le b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; a < b \text{ or } a = b.$$

Thus $a > b$ means $b < a$, and $a \ge b$ means $b \le a$. An element $x$ with
$-x \in P$ (equivalently $x < 0$) is called **negative**.

## Remarks

- By trichotomy applied to $b - a$, for any $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$,
  $a = b$, $a > b$ holds; this makes $\le$ a total order.
- (O2) says the positives are closed under addition and multiplication: sums and
  products of positives are positive.
- The rationals ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and both constructions of the reals
  ([[thm-reals-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-dedekind-ordered-field]]) are ordered
  fields, so every fact proved here from (O1)-(O2) holds in each of them.

## Definition

**Why this item is first.** The published definition of the integral does not
cover this page. [[def-darboux-integral]] is stated for reals $a < b$, because
the partitions it quantifies over are those of [[def-partition-and-refinement]],
whose standing hypothesis is $a < b$: with $a = b$ the chain
$a = t_0 < \dots < t_n = b$ is unsatisfiable. So $\int_a^b f$ is an undefined
symbol whenever $a \ge b$, and every additivity statement below would be
ill-formed as it is usually written. This item extends the notation, and nothing
else: the object it names is still the Darboux integral of
[[def-darboux-integral]].

Let $u, v \in \mathbb{R}$ and write

$$[u \wedge v,\ u \vee v] \;:=\; \text{the closed interval with endpoints } u \text{ and } v$$

([[def-interval]]). Let $f$ be a real-valued function whose domain contains that
interval. Say that **$f$ is integrable between $u$ and $v$** when either $u = v$,
or $u \ne v$ and the restriction of $f$ to $[u \wedge v,\ u \vee v]$ is bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]) and Darboux integrable there ([[def-darboux-integral]],
[[def-darboux-sums]]). For such $f$ define

$$\int_u^v f \;:=\; \begin{cases} \text{the Darboux integral of } f \text{ over } [u,v] & \text{if } u < v, \\[2pt] 0 & \text{if } u = v, \\[2pt] -\displaystyle\int_v^u f & \text{if } u > v. \end{cases}$$

**There is nothing to check for consistency.** The three clauses are indexed by
the three cases of trichotomy, $u < v$, $u = v$ and $u > v$, which are mutually
exclusive and exhaustive; no pair of them ever applies to the same $(u,v)$. In
particular the first clause is untouched, so on $u < v$ this is the published
integral verbatim and every published theorem about it applies unchanged.

**The middle clause is a stipulation, not a computation.** It is *not* claimed
that $0$ is a value forced by the $u < v$ definition in any limiting sense; that
definition simply says nothing at $u = v$, and $\int_u^u f := 0$ is what is
written there. It is also unconditional: no hypothesis on $f$ beyond being
defined at $u$ is asked for, since the case $u = v$ never refers to a partition.

### The two consequences used throughout the page

**Antisymmetry, for every pair.** For all reals $u, v$ with $f$ integrable
between them,

$$\int_u^v f \;=\; -\int_v^u f .$$

Indeed if $u < v$ then $v > u$ and the third clause reads
$\int_v^u f = -\int_u^v f$, which rearranges to the display; if $u = v$ both
sides are $0$; and if $u > v$ the third clause is the display itself.

**Absolute values agree.** Consequently
$\bigl|\int_u^v f\bigr| = \bigl|\int_v^u f\bigr|$ for every such pair.

**An obligation recorded here and discharged elsewhere.** With this convention
the additivity identity

$$\int_u^v f \;+\; \int_v^w f \;=\; \int_u^w f$$

holds for **every** arrangement of $u, v, w$ in an interval on which $f$ is
integrable, not only for $u < v < w$. That is a theorem and not part of this
definition; it is proved as the last clause of
[[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]], and nothing on this page uses it before it
is proved there.

## Remarks

- **This is notation, and it is a real notation.** Without it the substitution
  theorem could not be stated with the limits $\varphi(c)$ and $\varphi(d)$ in
  the order the map produces them, since a differentiable $\varphi$ need be
  neither injective nor monotone; and the integral function $x \mapsto \int_a^x f$
  would be undefined at $x = a$.

- **One published inequality is not orientation-invariant, and that is a trap.**
  The estimate $\bigl|\int_u^v f\bigr| \le \int_u^v |f|$ is guaranteed only
  for $u \le v$: at $u > v$ the right-hand side is $-\int_v^u |f| \le 0$ while
  the left-hand side is $\ge 0$, so the inequality fails whenever
  $\int_v^u |f| > 0$. The form valid for every pair is
  $\bigl|\int_u^v f\bigr| \le \bigl|\int_u^v |f|\bigr|$, and this is stated where
  it is proved ([[cor-integrability-of-absolute-values-products-and-lattice-operations]]).

- **Integrability is a property of the unordered pair.** By construction, $f$ is
  integrable between $u$ and $v$ if and only if it is integrable between $v$ and
  $u$, since both refer to the same closed interval; only the sign of the value
  remembers the order.

## Definition

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]). The **integral function of $f$ with base point $a$**
is

$$F : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad F(x) \;:=\; \int_a^x f .$$

**It is a genuine function, and that has to be checked.** For $x \in (a,b]$ the
restriction of $f$ to $[a,x]$ is integrable, by
[[lem-integrability-on-a-subinterval]] applied with $c := a$ and $d := x$, so
$\int_a^x f$ names a single real number ([[def-darboux-integral]]). For $x = a$
the symbol $\int_a^a f$ is $0$ by [[def-oriented-integral]]. So $F(x)$ is defined
at every point of $[a,b]$ and

$$F(a) \;=\; 0 .$$

More generally, for any base point $c \in [a,b]$ the function
$x \mapsto \int_c^x f$ is defined on the whole of $[a,b]$, the integral being the
oriented one of [[def-oriented-integral]] when $x < c$; the case $c = a$ is
written $F$ above and is the one used unless another base point is named.

### The two identities used throughout

**Increments are integrals.** For all $x, y \in [a,b]$, in either order,

$$F(y) - F(x) \;=\; \int_x^y f .$$

This is claim 3 of [[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]] applied to the three
points $a$, $x$, $y$: it gives $\int_a^x f + \int_x^y f = \int_a^y f$, that is
$F(x) + \int_x^y f = F(y)$. No ordering of $x$ and $y$ is assumed, and the
degenerate cases $x = y$, $x = a$ and $y = a$ are included, since claim 3 is
stated for arbitrary points.

**Changing the base point changes $F$ by a constant.** If $c \in [a,b]$ and
$F_c(x) := \int_c^x f$, then for every $x \in [a,b]$

$$F_c(x) \;=\; F(x) - F(c) ,$$

again by claim 3 of [[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]] at the points $a$, $c$,
$x$. So the family of integral functions of $f$ is one function up to an
additive constant.

## Remarks

- **$F$ exists for every integrable $f$, whether or not $f$ has a primitive.**
  Nothing in the definition asks $f$ to be continuous anywhere, and nothing here
  claims $F' = f$. The two statements about $F'$ that this page does prove are: $F$ is
  always Lipschitz ([[thm-the-integral-function-is-lipschitz]]), and $F'(c) = f(c)$
  at every point $c$ where $f$ is continuous ([[thm-ftc-first-part]]).

- **$F$ need not be a primitive of $f$.** At a discontinuity of $f$ the
  derivative $F'$ may fail to exist, or may exist and differ from $f$; both
  possibilities are exhibited on the companion page, by
  [[cex-an-integrable-function-with-no-primitive]] and
  [[fs-the-integral-function-is-always-a-primitive]]. That is the honest content
  of the phrase "the integral function", and it is why it is not called "the
  primitive" here.

- **Why the base point is part of the data and the notation suppresses it.** The
  symbol $F$ hides its dependence on $a$, as is customary; the identity
  $F_c = F - F(c)$ above is what makes the suppression harmless, since every
  statement below about $F$ is about its increments, which do not see the base
  point at all.

## Statement

**False claim:** let $a<b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be
Riemann integrable ([[def-darboux-integral]]). Then its integral function
$F(x) = \int_a^x f$ ([[def-the-integral-function]]) is differentiable at every
point of $[a,b]$ with $F'(x) = f(x)$ there.

The claim fails in **two independent ways**, and both are exhibited below.

1. $F'$ may fail to exist. For the sign function $s$ on $[-1,1]$
   ([[cex-an-integrable-function-with-no-primitive]]) one has $F(x) = |x|-1$,
   which is not differentiable at $0$.
2. $F'$ may exist and differ from $f$. On $[0,1]$ let $f(x) := 0$ for
   $x \ne 1/2$ and $f(1/2) := 1$. Then $F$ is the zero function, so $F'(1/2) = 0$
   while $f(1/2) = 1$.

The second witness shows the failure is not exotic: **any** integrable $f$ that
differs from a continuous $g$ at a single point has the same integral function as
$g$, by [[lem-changing-a-function-at-finitely-many-points]], and therefore has
$F' = g \ne f$ at that point. Continuity of $f$ at the point is what the true
theorem [[thm-ftc-first-part]] asks for, and it asks for nothing more. It is not
claimed here to be *necessary*: what the conclusion needs is the equality
$F'(c) = f(c)$, and the last Remark below exhibits an $f$ discontinuous at a
point where that equality nevertheless holds.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The sign function $s$ on $[-1,1]$ of [[cex-an-integrable-function-with-no-primitive]], with $s(x) = -1$ for $x<0$, $s(0) = 0$ and $s(x) = 1$ for $x>0$; and the function $f$ on $[0,1]$ with $f(1/2) = 1$ and $f(x) = 0$ otherwise.

[A1] The false claim: for every integrable $u$ on $[p,q]$, the integral function of $u$ is differentiable everywhere on $[p,q]$ with derivative $u$.

[L1] $s$ is Riemann integrable on $[-1,1]$ ([[cex-an-integrable-function-with-no-primitive]], [[thm-finitely-many-discontinuities-integrable]], [[def-classification-of-discontinuities]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L2] Changing an integrable function at finitely many points changes neither its integrability nor its integral, and $\int_p^q c = c(q-p)$ for a constant ([[lem-changing-a-function-at-finitely-many-points]], [[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]]).

[L3] Additivity in the oriented form for arbitrary points, and $\int_p^p u = 0$ ([[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]], claim 3, [[def-oriented-integral]], [[def-the-integral-function]]).

[L4] If both one-sided limits of a function at $c$ exist and differ, the two-sided limit does not exist, so the derivative there does not exist ([[thm-two-sided-limit-iff-both-one-sided]], [[def-one-sided-limits]], [[def-function-limit]], [[def-derivative]]).

[L5] Absolute value: $|x| = x$ for $x \ge 0$, $|x| = -x$ for $x \le 0$, and $|x|/x$ is $1$ for $x>0$ and $-1$ for $x<0$ ([[def-abs-value]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L6] First fundamental theorem: if $u$ is integrable on $[p,q]$ and continuous at $c$, then the integral function of $u$ has derivative $u(c)$ at $c$ ([[thm-ftc-first-part]], [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L7] Ordered-field arithmetic: the order is total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-interval]]).

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **First witness.** $s$ is integrable on $[-1,1]$ by [L1], and its integral function is $F(x) = \int_{-1}^{x}s$. [given, L1]

1.2 **Second witness.** The function $f$ on $[0,1]$ is bounded and agrees with the constant $0$ off the single point $1/2$, so it is integrable with $\int_0^{x}f = \int_0^{x}0 = 0$ for every $x \in [0,1]$ by [L2] and [L3]; hence its integral function is the zero function. [given, L2, L3]

2.1 For $x \in [0,1]$: by [L3], $F(x) = \int_{-1}^{0}s + \int_0^{x}s$, and $s$ agrees with the constant $-1$ on $[-1,0]$ off the single point $0$ and with the constant $1$ on $[0,x]$ off the single point $0$, so [L2] gives $F(x) = -1 + x$. For $x \in [-1,0]$: $s$ agrees with the constant $-1$ on $[x,0]$ off $0$, so $\int_{-1}^{x}s = -(x-(-1)) = -x-1$ by [L2] and [L3]. In both cases $F(x) = |x|-1$ by [L5]. [step 1.1, L2, L3, L5]

2.2 The zero function is differentiable everywhere with derivative $0$, so its derivative at $1/2$ is $0$, while $f(1/2) = 1 \ne 0$. Here $F'$ **exists** at the point and differs from $f$ there, so [A1] fails again, in a different way. [step 1.2, given, L2, L7]

3.1 The difference quotient of $F$ at $0$ is $x \mapsto (F(x)-F(0))/x = |x|/x$, which is $1$ for $x>0$ and $-1$ for $x<0$ by [L5]; so its one-sided limits at $0$ are $1$ and $-1$. [step 2.1, L5]

4.1 By [L4] the limit of that quotient at $0$ does not exist, so $F$ is not differentiable at $0$ and [A1] fails at $s$: the claim is false. [step 3.1, A1, L4]

5.1 Both failures occur exactly at a discontinuity of the integrand: $s$ is discontinuous at $0$ and $f$ at $1/2$. Off those points [L6] applies and gives $F' = f$, so the correct statement is [[thm-ftc-first-part]], whose hypothesis is continuity of the integrand at the point in question. [step 4.1, step 2.2, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- **The two witnesses are genuinely different failures.** In the first, $F$ has no derivative at the bad point at all; in the second, $F$ is as smooth as could be wished and simply computes a different number. A repair attempting to weaken the conclusion to "$F$ is differentiable wherever it can be" would still be refuted by the second witness.

- **What is always true of $F$ is one dimension weaker.** For every integrable $f$ the integral function is Lipschitz, hence uniformly continuous ([[thm-the-integral-function-is-lipschitz]]); differentiability is exactly what continuity of the integrand buys, and nothing more is available.

- **The failure set can be much larger than a point.** For Thomae's function $t$ on $[0,1]$ the integral function is identically $0$, so $F' = 0$ while $t$ is positive at every rational: the claim above then fails at every point of an infinite set, not merely at finitely many. No general statement is made here about an arbitrary integrable $f$ — at a discontinuity where $f$ happens to take the value $F'$ does, the two agree, and $f$ vanishing off $\{1/\iota(n+1)\}$ is such a case at the point $0$.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]), and let $c, d$ satisfy

$$a \;\le\; c \;<\; d \;\le\; b .$$

Then the restriction of $f$ to $[c,d]$ is bounded ([[def-bounded-set]]) and
integrable on $[c,d]$.

The degenerate case $c = d$ is not an omission: there $\int_c^c f = 0$ by
[[def-oriented-integral]], and no partition of $[c,d]$ exists to speak of
([[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, an integrable $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, and reals $c, d$ with $a \le c < d \le b$. Write $g$ for the restriction of $f$ to $[c,d]$.

[L1] Riemann's criterion: a bounded function on a closed bounded interval with distinct endpoints is integrable if and only if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a partition $P$ of that interval with $U(\cdot,P) - L(\cdot,P) < \varepsilon$ ([[thm-riemann-criterion]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L2] For a partition $P$ of $[a,b]$ and a point $p \in [a,b]$, the partition $P + p$ satisfies $\operatorname{pts}(P+p) = \operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \{p\}$ and refines $P$; a refinement of a refinement refines the original, since the point-set inclusions compose ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L3] If $P'$ refines $P$ then $L(f,P) \le L(f,P') \le U(f,P') \le U(f,P)$ ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]], claim 1).

[L4] For a partition $R = (n,t)$ of an interval and bounded $h$ on it: $L(h,R) = \sum_{i<n} m_i \Delta_i$, $U(h,R) = \sum_{i<n} M_i\Delta_i$ with $m_i = \inf h[I_i]$, $M_i = \sup h[I_i]$, $I_i = [t_i,t_{i+1}]$, $\Delta_i = t_{i+1}-t_i > 0$, and $M_i - m_i \ge 0$ ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-interval]]).

[L5] Finite sums: additivity, scaling, splitting at an intermediate index with $\sum_{k=m}^{n-1}a_k = \sum_{j<n-m}a_{m+j}$, and monotonicity in the terms, so that a sum of nonnegative terms is at most a sum containing those terms among others ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], clauses 1 to 4).

[L6] A partition $P' = (n',t')$ of $[a,b]$ has $t'$ strictly increasing on indices $\le n'$, hence injective there, so a point of $\operatorname{pts}(P')$ is $t'_j$ for exactly one $j \le n'$; and $j < k$ gives $t'_j < t'_k$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L7] A restriction of a bounded function is bounded: the same $M$ serves fewer points ([[def-bounded-set]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $g$ is bounded on $[c,d]$, since $[c,d] \subseteq [a,b]$ and $f$ is bounded on $[a,b]$, integrability presupposing boundedness. [given, L7]

1.2 Let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given, and fix a partition $P$ of $[a,b]$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$. [given, L1, choose]

2.1 Put $P' := (P + c) + d$, a partition of $[a,b]$ refining $P$ whose point set contains $c$ and $d$. [step 1.2, L2, construct]

3.1 By [L3] applied to the pair $(P, P')$, $U(f,P') - L(f,P') \le U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L3]

3.2 Write $P' = (n',t')$ and fix the unique indices $p, q \le n'$ with $t'_p = c$ and $t'_q = d$; then $p < q$, because $c < d$ and $t'$ is increasing on those indices. [step 2.1, L6, choose]

4.1 Define $Q := (q-p,\ s)$ by $s_i := t'_{p+i}$ for $i \le q-p$ and $s_k := d$ for $k \ge q-p$. Then $s_0 = t'_p = c$, $s_{q-p} = t'_q = d$, and $s_i < s_{i+1}$ for $i < q-p$ by [L6], with $q - p \ge 1$; so $Q$ is a partition of $[c,d]$, its $i$-th subinterval is $[t'_{p+i}, t'_{p+i+1}] = I'_{p+i}$ and its $i$-th length is $\Delta'_{p+i}$. [step 3.2, L6, construct]

5.1 For $i < q-p$ the $i$-th subinterval of $Q$ is $I'_{p+i} \subseteq [c,d]$, and $g$ agrees with $f$ there, so the extreme values of $g$ on it are $M'_{p+i}$ and $m'_{p+i}$; hence $U(g,Q) - L(g,Q) = \sum_{i<q-p}\bigl(M'_{p+i} - m'_{p+i}\bigr)\Delta'_{p+i}$ by [L4] and [L5]. [step 4.1, L4, L5]

6.1 Every term $\bigl(M'_j - m'_j\bigr)\Delta'_j$ is nonnegative by [L4], and splitting $\sum_{j<n'}$ first at $p$ and then at $q$ exhibits $\sum_{i<q-p}\bigl(M'_{p+i}-m'_{p+i}\bigr)\Delta'_{p+i}$ as one of the three pieces of $\sum_{j<n'}\bigl(M'_j-m'_j\bigr)\Delta'_j$, the other two being nonnegative; so the displayed sum is at most $U(f,P') - L(f,P')$. [step 5.1, L4, L5]

7.1 Combining, $U(g,Q) - L(g,Q) \le U(f,P') - L(f,P') < \varepsilon$. [step 3.1, step 5.1, step 6.1]

8.1 Since $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary and $g$ is bounded, [L1] applies on $[c,d]$ and $g$ is integrable there. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 7.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The one step that is not bookkeeping is the re-indexing.** A partition in this library is a pair $(n,t)$ with a tail convention ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]), not a set of points, so "restrict $P'$ to $[c,d]$" is not a defined operation; step 4.1 writes the restricted list out, shifts its index by $p$ and resets its tail to $d$. Everything else follows from the fact that dropping nonnegative terms from a finite sum cannot increase it.

- **The converse is also true, and is proved separately.** Integrability on $[a,c]$ and on $[c,b]$ gives integrability on $[a,b]$; that direction needs a splice rather than a restriction and is the second half of [[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]].

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfy

$$m \;\le\; f(x) \;\le\; M \qquad \text{for every } x \in [a,b],$$

with $m, M$ real. Then $f$ is bounded ([[def-bounded-set]]), so its Darboux sums
and integrals are defined ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-darboux-integral]]), and
for **every** partition $P$ of $[a,b]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]])

$$m(b-a) \;\le\; L(f,P) \;\le\; \underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; U(f,P) \;\le\; M(b-a) .$$

In particular, taking $f$ to be the constant function with value $c$:

$$\int_a^b c \;=\; c\,(b-a) ,$$

the constant function being integrable, with $L(f,P) = U(f,P) = c(b-a)$ for
every partition $P$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, reals $m \le M$, and $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ with $m \le f(x) \le M$ for every $x \in [a,b]$. Let $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$, with subintervals $I_i$ and lengths $\Delta_i$ for $i < n$.

[L1] $\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = b - a$, every $\Delta_i > 0$, and $n \ge 1$; each $I_i$ is a nonempty subset of $[a,b]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-interval]]).

[L2] $m_i = \inf f[I_i]$ and $M_i = \sup f[I_i]$ exist, $L(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}m_i\Delta_i$ and $U(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}M_i\Delta_i$, and $m_i \le f(x) \le M_i$ for $x \in I_i$ ([[def-darboux-sums]]).

[L3] $L(f,P) \le \underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,P)$ for every partition $P$; $f$ is integrable exactly when the two integrals are equal, and then $\int_a^b f$ is their common value ([[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L4] An infimum is the greatest lower bound and a supremum the least upper bound; a set with a single element has that element as both ([[def-infimum]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L5] Finite sums: scaling, monotonicity in the terms, and $\sum_{i<n}\lambda\,\Delta_i = \lambda\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L6] Ordered-field arithmetic: multiplying an inequality by a positive quantity preserves it, adding a constant preserves it, and the order is transitive; $|x| \le \max\{|m|,|M|\}$ whenever $m \le x \le M$ ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $f$ is bounded: $|f(x)| \le \max\{|m|,|M|\}$ for every $x \in [a,b]$ by [L6], so the Darboux sums and integrals of [L2] and [L3] are defined. [given, L6]

1.2 For every $i < n$: $m$ is a lower bound of $f[I_i]$ and $M$ an upper bound, since $I_i \subseteq [a,b]$; the set $f[I_i]$ is nonempty by [L1]. Hence $m \le m_i$ and $M_i \le M$ by [L4]. [given, L1, L2, L4]

1.3 **The constant case, treated on its own.** Suppose in addition that $f$ is the constant function with value $c$, that is $f(x) = c$ for every $x \in [a,b]$; the general argument below does not use this supposition. Then $f[I_i] = \{c\}$ for every $i < n$ by [L1], so $m_i = M_i = c$ by [L4], and $L(f,P) = U(f,P) = \sum_{i<n} c\,\Delta_i = c(b-a)$ by [L5] and [L1]. [L1, L2, L4, L5]

2.1 $L(f,P) \ge m(b-a)$: by step 1.2 and $\Delta_i > 0$ one has $m_i\Delta_i \ge m\Delta_i$ for every $i < n$, so monotonicity and scaling in [L5] give $L(f,P) \ge \sum_{i<n} m\,\Delta_i = m\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = m(b-a)$ by [L1]. [step 1.2, L1, L5, L6]

2.2 $U(f,P) \le M(b-a)$: the same argument with $M_i \le M$ gives $U(f,P) \le \sum_{i<n}M\,\Delta_i = M(b-a)$. [step 1.2, L1, L5, L6]

3.1 Combining steps 2.1 and 2.2 with the chain of [L3] gives the displayed five-term inequality for every partition $P$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L3]

4.1 Hence, still under the supposition of step 1.3 that $f$ is constant with value $c$, the set of lower sums and the set of upper sums are both $\{c(b-a)\}$, so $\underline{\int_a^b} f = \overline{\int_a^b} f = c(b-a)$ by [L4], $f$ is integrable, and $\int_a^b c = c(b-a)$ by [L3]. [step 1.3, L3, L4] ∎

## Remarks

- **The five-term chain is the only estimate most of this page needs.** Every integrability proof below produces one partition and controls $U(f,P) - L(f,P)$; the chain then locates both integrals inside an interval of that length, and [[thm-riemann-criterion]] turns the observation into an equivalence.

- **The bounds are sharp, but equality does not characterize constants.** Constant functions show that neither outer coefficient can be improved. Nonconstant functions can also attain equality: for the Dirichlet indicator on $[0,1]$, every partition has $L(f,P) = 0$ and $U(f,P) = 1$, so both outer bounds are equalities.

- **Nonnegativity, as a special case.** If $f \ge 0$ on $[a,b]$ then $m$ may be taken to be $0$, so $\int_a^b f \ge 0$ whenever the integral exists. A nonnegative integrand with vanishing integral need not vanish, however; that is [[fs-nonnegative-integrable-with-zero-integral-vanishes]].

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$, with
$|x|$ the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]). Then

$$|x| \ge 0; \quad |x| = 0 \iff x = 0; \quad -|x| \le x \le |x|; \quad |-x| = |x|; \quad |xy| = |x|\,|y|;$$

and, for every $c > 0$, one has $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and elements $x, y \in F$.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| = u$ if $u \ge 0$, and $|u| = -u$ if $u < 0$ ([[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Ordered-field order: trichotomy holds (for each $u$ exactly one of $u > 0$, $u = 0$, $u < 0$), $a < b$ means $b - a$ is positive, and sums and products of positives are positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Signs in products: $(-a)b = -(ab)$ and $(-a)(-b) = ab$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] Sign rules: a product of two elements of the same sign is positive, and a product of two elements of opposite sign is negative ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Case $x > 0$: by [L1] $|x| = x > 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; since $-x < 0$ we get $|-x| = -(-x) = x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -x < 0 < x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case pos, L1, L2, algebra]

1.2 Case $x = 0$: then $|x| = |0| = 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ holds with $|x| = 0$ and $x = 0$, while $|-x| = |0| = |x|$ and $-|x| = 0 \le 0 \le 0 = |x|$. [assume-case zero, L1]

1.3 Case $x < 0$: by [L1] $|x| = -x$, and [L2] gives $-x > 0$, so $|x| > 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; here $|-x| = -x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -(-x) = x \le x$ while $x < 0 < -x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case neg, L1, L2, algebra]

1.4 Case $x = 0$ or $y = 0$: then $xy = 0$, so $|xy| = 0$, and one of $|x|, |y|$ is $0$, whence $|x|\,|y| = 0 = |xy|$. [assume-case zerofactor, L1]

1.5 Case $x, y$ have the same sign (both positive or both negative): by [L4] $xy > 0$, so $|xy| = xy$, while $|x|\,|y| = xy$ by [L3] (for $x, y < 0$ this is $(-x)(-y) = xy$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case same, L1, L3, L4]

1.6 Case $x, y$ have opposite signs (one positive, one negative): by [L4] $xy < 0$, so $|xy| = -(xy)$, while $|x|\,|y| = -(xy)$ by [L3] (namely $x(-y)$ or $(-x)y$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case opposite, L1, L3, L4]

2.1 By trichotomy [L2] each $x$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.1-1.3, and in each we verified $|x| \ge 0$, that $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$, that $|-x| = |x|$, and that $-|x| \le x \le |x|$; hence all four hold for every $x$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, cases-exhaustive]

2.2 By trichotomy [L2] each pair $x, y$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.4-1.6, and in each $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$ for all $x, y$. [step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6, cases-exhaustive]

3.1 Let $c > 0$: if $|x| < c$ then $-c < -|x| \le x \le |x| < c$ by [step 2.1] and [L2], so $-c < x < c$; conversely if $-c < x < c$ then both $x < c$ and $-x < c$, and since $|x|$ equals $x$ or $-x$ by [L1], we get $|x| < c$, so $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$. [step 2.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Statement

Let $a < c < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]). Then:

1. $f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ ([[def-darboux-integral]]) **if and only if** its
   restrictions to $[a,c]$ and to $[c,b]$ are integrable;
2. and in that case
   $$\int_a^b f \;=\; \int_a^c f \;+\; \int_c^b f .$$
3. **Oriented form.** Let $\alpha < \beta$ be reals, let $f : [\alpha,\beta] \to
   \mathbb{R}$ be integrable, and let $u, v, w \in [\alpha,\beta]$ be arbitrary.
   Then, with the convention of [[def-oriented-integral]],
   $$\int_u^v f \;+\; \int_v^w f \;=\; \int_u^w f .$$

Claim 3 is where [[def-oriented-integral]] earns its place: it holds for every
arrangement of the three points, including the degenerate ones, and it is the
form used everywhere below.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < c < b$ and a bounded $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$; and, for claim 3, reals $\alpha < \beta$, an integrable $f : [\alpha,\beta] \to \mathbb{R}$ and points $u,v,w \in [\alpha,\beta]$. Let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given.

[L1] Riemann's criterion on any closed bounded interval with distinct endpoints ([[thm-riemann-criterion]]).

[L2] A function integrable on $[p,q]$ is integrable on every $[p',q'] \subseteq [p,q]$ with $p' < q'$ ([[lem-integrability-on-a-subinterval]]).

[L3] For a partition $R = (n,t)$ and bounded $h$: $L(h,R) = \sum_{i<n}m_i\Delta_i$, $U(h,R) = \sum_{i<n}M_i\Delta_i$, and $L(h,R) \le \underline{\int} h \le \overline{\int} h \le U(h,R)$, the integral being the common value of the two when they agree ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L4] A partition of $[p,q]$ is a pair $(n,t)$ with $n \ge 1$, $t_0 = p$, $t_i < t_{i+1}$ for $i < n$ and $t_k = q$ for $k \ge n$; its subintervals are $[t_i,t_{i+1}]$ for $i<n$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-interval]]).

[L5] Finite sums split at an intermediate index, with $\sum_{k=p}^{q-1}x_k = \sum_{j<q-p}x_{p+j}$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], clause 3).

[L6] With oriented limits, $\int_v^u h = -\int_u^v h$ and $\int_u^u h = 0$ ([[def-oriented-integral]]).

[L7] Ordered-field arithmetic: adding a constant preserves an inequality, the order is total and transitive, and a real of absolute value below every positive real is $0$ ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Claim 1, forward.** If $f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ then, since $a < c$ and $c < b$, [L2] gives integrability on $[a,c]$ and on $[c,b]$. [L2]

1.2 **The splice.** Let $P_1 = (n_1,t^1)$ be a partition of $[a,c]$ and $P_2 = (n_2,t^2)$ one of $[c,b]$. Define $P := (n_1+n_2,\ t)$ by $t_i := t^1_i$ for $i \le n_1$, $t_{n_1+j} := t^2_j$ for $j \le n_2$, and $t_k := b$ for $k \ge n_1+n_2$. The two prescriptions agree at $i = n_1$, where $t^1_{n_1} = c = t^2_0$; and $t_0 = a$, $t_{n_1+n_2} = t^2_{n_2} = b$, with $t_i < t_{i+1}$ for every $i < n_1+n_2$. So $P$ is a partition of $[a,b]$. [L4, construct]

1.3 **Claim 1, converse.** Suppose $f$ is integrable on $[a,c]$ and on $[c,b]$, and use [L1] on each to fix $P_1$ with $U(f,P_1)-L(f,P_1) < \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1}$ and $P_2$ with $U(f,P_2)-L(f,P_2) < \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1}$. [L1, choose]

2.1 The first $n_1$ subintervals of $P$ are those of $P_1$ and the last $n_2$ are those of $P_2$, with the matching lengths, so by [L3] and the splitting law [L5], $L(f,P) = L(f,P_1) + L(f,P_2)$ and $U(f,P) = U(f,P_1) + U(f,P_2)$. [step 1.2, L3, L4, L5]

3.1 For the splice $P$ of those two, step 2.1 gives $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$; as $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary and $f$ is bounded, [L1] makes $f$ integrable on $[a,b]$. [step 1.2, step 2.1, step 1.3, L1, L7]

4.1 **Claim 2.** With $P_1$, $P_2$ and $P$ as above, [L3] puts $\int_a^b f$ between $L(f,P)$ and $U(f,P)$, that is between $L(f,P_1)+L(f,P_2)$ and $U(f,P_1)+U(f,P_2)$ by step 2.1; and [L3] applied on $[a,c]$ and on $[c,b]$ puts $\int_a^c f + \int_c^b f$ between the same two numbers. [step 2.1, step 1.3, step 3.1, L3]

5.1 Those two numbers differ by less than $\varepsilon$ by step 1.3, so $\bigl|\int_a^b f - \int_a^c f - \int_c^b f\bigr| < \varepsilon$; as $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary the difference is $0$, which is claim 2. [step 1.3, step 4.1, L7]

6.1 **Claim 3, first the sorted case.** Let $x \le y$ in $[\alpha,\beta]$. Then $\int_\alpha^y f = \int_\alpha^x f + \int_x^y f$. Indeed if $\alpha < x < y$ this is claim 2 applied on $[\alpha,y]$, where $f$ is integrable by [L2]; if $x = \alpha$ the middle term is $0$ by [L6] and the identity is trivial; and if $x = y$ the last term is $0$ by [L6] and the identity is again trivial. [step 5.1, L2, L6]

7.1 Put $F(x) := \int_\alpha^x f$ for $x \in [\alpha,\beta]$, which is defined by [L2] and [L6]. Then $\int_x^y f = F(y) - F(x)$ for **all** $x,y \in [\alpha,\beta]$: for $x < y$ this is step 6.1 rearranged; for $x = y$ both sides are $0$ by [L6]; and for $x > y$ the case already proved gives $\int_y^x f = F(x)-F(y)$, and [L6] negates both sides. [step 6.1, L2, L6, construct]

8.1 **Claim 3.** For arbitrary $u,v,w \in [\alpha,\beta]$, step 7.1 gives $\int_u^v f + \int_v^w f = \bigl(F(v)-F(u)\bigr) + \bigl(F(w)-F(v)\bigr) = F(w)-F(u) = \int_u^w f$. [step 7.1, algebra] ∎

## Remarks

- **The oriented form is not proved by listing six orderings.** Step 7.1 shows that the oriented integral between two points is a *difference of values of one function of one variable*, after which claim 3 is the cancellation $(F(v)-F(u))+(F(w)-F(v)) = F(w)-F(u)$, valid however the three points are arranged and however many of them coincide. The case analysis is confined to the two lines of step 7.1, and no appeal to symmetry is made anywhere.

- **The function $F$ of step 7.1 is the integral function**, and it is given its own item, [[def-the-integral-function]], because the rest of the page is about it. Nothing there re-proves step 7.1; it cites this theorem.

- **Boundedness on the whole of $[a,b]$ is a hypothesis of claim 1 in both directions.** Boundedness on $[a,c]$ and on $[c,b]$ separately does give boundedness on the union, so the converse could be stated with the hypothesis split; it is stated globally because [[def-darboux-sums]] needs it globally to make $U(f,P)$ meaningful for a partition of $[a,b]$.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $[a,b]$
([[def-continuity-real]]) and let $g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]) with $g(x) \ge 0$ for every $x \in [a,b]$. Then $fg$
is integrable and there is $\xi \in [a,b]$ with

$$\int_a^b f\,g \;=\; f(\xi)\,\int_a^b g .$$

**The special case $g \equiv 1$** is the familiar statement that a continuous
function attains its average value: there is $\xi \in [a,b]$ with

$$\int_a^b f \;=\; f(\xi)\,(b-a) ,$$

and it is this clause that the fundamental theorem below is usually derived
from in other treatments.

**The hypothesis $g \ge 0$ is essential.** For a sign-changing integrable $g$
the conclusion fails, and the witness is
the counterexample with a sign-changing weight on the companion
page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, a continuous $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, and an integrable $g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ with $g \ge 0$ on $[a,b]$.

[L1] $[a,b]$ is compact, and a continuous real function on a nonempty compact set attains a minimum and a maximum there ([[thm-heine-borel-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]], [[thm-extreme-value-r]], [[def-max-min]], [[def-interval]]).

[L2] For continuous $f$ on $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, $f[\,[a,b]\,] = [\min f[\,[a,b]\,],\ \max f[\,[a,b]\,]]$ ([[cor-continuous-image-of-an-interval-is-an-interval]], claim 2).

[L3] A continuous function on $[a,b]$ is integrable there ([[thm-continuous-implies-integrable]]).

[L4] A product of two integrable functions on $[a,b]$ is integrable ([[cor-integrability-of-absolute-values-products-and-lattice-operations]], claim 1).

[L5] If $u \le w$ pointwise and both are integrable then $\int_a^b u \le \int_a^b w$; and if $u \ge 0$ is integrable then $\int_a^b u \ge 0$ ([[thm-monotonicity-of-the-integral]]).

[L6] Scalar multiples: $\int_a^b \lambda u = \lambda\int_a^b u$ ([[thm-linearity-of-the-integral]]), and $\int_a^b 1 = b-a$ ([[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]]).

[L7] Ordered-field arithmetic: multiplying an inequality by a nonnegative quantity preserves it, a positive real has a positive inverse, and the order is total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $f$ is integrable by [L3], so $fg$ is integrable by [L4]. [given, L3, L4]

1.2 By [L1] fix $p, q \in [a,b]$ with $f(q) = \min f[\,[a,b]\,] =: m$ and $f(p) = \max f[\,[a,b]\,] =: M$, so $m \le f(x) \le M$ for every $x \in [a,b]$. [given, L1, choose]

1.3 By [L5], $\int_a^b g \ge 0$. [given, L5]

2.1 Since $g \ge 0$, multiplying the inequalities of step 1.2 by $g(x)$ gives $m\,g(x) \le f(x)g(x) \le M\,g(x)$ for every $x \in [a,b]$, and all three functions are integrable by step 1.1 and [L6]. [step 1.1, step 1.2, given, L6, L7]

3.1 By [L5] and [L6] applied to step 2.1, $m\int_a^b g \;\le\; \int_a^b fg \;\le\; M\int_a^b g$. [step 2.1, L5, L6]

4.1 **The case $\int_a^b g = 0$.** Then step 3.1 reads $0 \le \int_a^b fg \le 0$, so $\int_a^b fg = 0 = f(a)\int_a^b g$, and $\xi := a$ works. [step 1.3, step 3.1, L7]

4.2 **The case $\int_a^b g > 0$.** Then $\lambda := \bigl(\int_a^b fg\bigr)\big/\bigl(\int_a^b g\bigr)$ is a real satisfying $m \le \lambda \le M$, by step 3.1 divided by the positive $\int_a^b g$. [step 1.3, step 3.1, L7, construct]

5.1 By step 1.2 and [L2], $f[\,[a,b]\,] = [m,M]$, so $\lambda = f(\xi)$ for some $\xi \in [a,b]$; then $\int_a^b fg = \lambda\int_a^b g = f(\xi)\int_a^b g$. [step 1.2, step 4.2, L2, L7, choose]

6.1 The two cases $\int_a^b g = 0$ and $\int_a^b g > 0$ are exhaustive by step 1.3, so the theorem holds. [step 1.3, step 4.1, step 5.1, L7]

7.1 **The clause $g \equiv 1$.** The constant $1$ is integrable, nonnegative, with $\int_a^b 1 = b-a$ by [L6], so step 6.1 gives $\xi \in [a,b]$ with $\int_a^b f = f(\xi)(b-a)$. [step 6.1, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- **The case $\int_a^b g = 0$ is handled first because the usual proof divides by it.** There the conclusion is trivially true for *every* $\xi$, and nothing is claimed about the location of a distinguished point; the theorem asserts only that some $\xi$ works.

- **No intermediate value theorem is invoked directly.** What is needed is that the continuous image of $[a,b]$ is exactly $[\min,\max]$, which is claim 2 of [[cor-continuous-image-of-an-interval-is-an-interval]]; that item is itself proved from the intermediate and extreme value theorems, and citing it here saves repeating the argument.

- **$\xi$ can be forced to lie in the open interval only under extra hypotheses**, and none is claimed. The standard refinement puts $\xi$ in the open interval when $g \equiv 1$; it is not proved here, it is not needed anywhere on this page, and the theorem does not assert it.

- **Forward reference, orientation only.** The witness showing that $g \ge 0$ cannot be dropped is [[cex-the-first-mean-value-theorem-needs-a-one-signed-weight]] on the companion page; nothing above depends on it.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]). Then:

1. $f + g$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ and
   $\int_a^b (f+g) = \int_a^b f + \int_a^b g$;
2. for every real $\lambda$, $\lambda f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ and
   $\int_a^b \lambda f = \lambda \int_a^b f$;
3. consequently, for all reals $\lambda, \mu$ the function $\lambda f + \mu g$ is
   integrable and
   $$\int_a^b(\lambda f + \mu g) \;=\; \lambda\int_a^b f \;+\; \mu\int_a^b g ;$$
4. the same identity holds with oriented limits: if $u, v \in [a,b]$ and $f, g$
   are integrable between $u$ and $v$ ([[def-oriented-integral]]), then
   $\int_u^v(\lambda f + \mu g) = \lambda\int_u^v f + \mu\int_u^v g$.

**Linearity of the integral is not linearity of the Darboux sums**, and the
proof of claim 1 has to squeeze rather than compute. On a subinterval the
inequality $\sup(f+g) \le \sup f + \sup g$ can be strict — take $f(x) = x$ and
$g(x) = -x$ on $[0,1]$, where the left side is $0$ and the right side is $1$ —
so $U(f+g,P)$ is in general strictly below $U(f,P) + U(g,P)$ and no identity
between upper sums is available. Claim 2, by contrast, is an identity at the
level of the sums, with the roles of $\sup$ and $\inf$ exchanged when
$\lambda < 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, integrable $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, reals $\lambda, \mu$, and a real $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] Riemann's criterion: a bounded $h$ on $[a,b]$ is integrable if and only if for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a partition $P$ with $U(h,P) - L(h,P) < \eta$ ([[thm-riemann-criterion]]).

[L2] For every partition $P$ and bounded $h$: $L(h,P) \le \underline{\int_a^b} h \le \overline{\int_a^b} h \le U(h,P)$, and $h$ is integrable exactly when the two integrals agree, their common value being $\int_a^b h$; the lower integral is $\sup_P L(h,P)$ and the upper is $\inf_P U(h,P)$ ([[def-darboux-integral]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L3] $L(h,P) = \sum_{i<n} m_i(h)\Delta_i$ and $U(h,P) = \sum_{i<n}M_i(h)\Delta_i$, where $m_i(h) = \inf h[I_i]$ and $M_i(h) = \sup h[I_i]$ over the subintervals $I_i$ of $P = (n,t)$, with $\Delta_i > 0$; an integrable function is bounded, and a sum of two bounded functions and a scalar multiple of a bounded function are bounded ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L4] If $P'$ refines $P$ then $L(h,P) \le L(h,P') \le U(h,P') \le U(h,P)$; the common refinement $P_1 \vee P_2$ refines both ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L5] Finite sums are additive and homogeneous: $\sum_{i<n}(x_i + y_i) = \sum_{i<n}x_i + \sum_{i<n}y_i$ and $\sum_{i<n}\lambda x_i = \lambda\sum_{i<n}x_i$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], clauses 1 and 2).

[L6] A supremum is the least upper bound and an infimum the greatest lower bound; both exist for a nonempty bounded set and are unique ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-infimum]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L7] Reflection: writing $-S = \{-s : s \in S\}$, a real $u$ is an upper bound of $S$ exactly when $-u$ is a lower bound of $-S$, and conversely; hence $\sup(-S) = -\inf S$ and $\inf(-S) = -\sup S$ for nonempty bounded $S$, by [L6] ([[lem-reflection]]).

[L8] The constant function $0$ is integrable with $\int_a^b 0 = 0$ ([[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]]).

[L9] Ordered-field arithmetic: adding a constant and multiplying by a positive quantity preserve an inequality, the order is total and transitive, and a real $x$ with $|x| < \eta$ for every real $\eta > 0$ is $0$ ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order facts are used in their nonstrict form as well, obtained by adjoining the case of equality.

[L10] With oriented limits, $\int_v^u h = -\int_u^v h$ and $\int_u^u h = 0$ ([[def-oriented-integral]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $f$, $g$, $f+g$ and $\lambda f$ are bounded on $[a,b]$, so all their Darboux sums and integrals are defined. [given, L3]

1.2 For every partition $P = (n,t)$ and every $i < n$: $f(x) + g(x) \le M_i(f) + M_i(g)$ for $x \in I_i$, so $M_i(f) + M_i(g)$ is an upper bound of $(f+g)[I_i]$ and $M_i(f+g) \le M_i(f) + M_i(g)$ by [L6]; dually $m_i(f+g) \ge m_i(f) + m_i(g)$. [L3, L6]

1.3 Fix partitions $P_1$ and $P_2$ with $U(f,P_1) - L(f,P_1) < \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$ and $U(g,P_2) - L(g,P_2) < \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$, and put $P := P_1 \vee P_2$. [given, L1, L4, choose]

1.4 **Claim 2, the case $\lambda = 0$.** Then $\lambda f$ is the constant function $0$, integrable with integral $0 = 0 \cdot \int_a^b f$. [L8]

1.5 **Claim 2, the case $\lambda > 0$.** For every partition $P$ and every $i < n$, $\lambda M_i(f)$ is an upper bound of $(\lambda f)[I_i]$, and any upper bound $w$ of $(\lambda f)[I_i]$ gives the upper bound $w/\lambda$ of $f[I_i]$, whence $M_i(f) \le w/\lambda$ and $\lambda M_i(f) \le w$; so $M_i(\lambda f) = \lambda M_i(f)$ by [L6], and dually $m_i(\lambda f) = \lambda m_i(f)$. [L3, L6, L9]

1.6 **Claim 2, the case $\lambda = -1$.** For every $P$ and $i < n$, $(-f)[I_i] = -\bigl(f[I_i]\bigr)$, so $M_i(-f) = -m_i(f)$ and $m_i(-f) = -M_i(f)$ by [L7]. [L3, L7]

2.1 By [L4], $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1}$ and $U(g,P) - L(g,P) < \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$. [step 1.3, L4]

2.2 Summing the inequalities of step 1.2 over $i < n$ against the positive weights $\Delta_i$ and using [L5] gives $L(f,P) + L(g,P) \le L(f+g,P) \le U(f+g,P) \le U(f,P) + U(g,P)$. [step 1.2, L3, L5, L9]

2.3 With step 1.5 and [L5], $U(\lambda f,P) = \lambda U(f,P)$ and $L(\lambda f, P) = \lambda L(f,P)$ for $\lambda > 0$; hence $U(\lambda f,P)-L(\lambda f,P) = \lambda\bigl(U(f,P)-L(f,P)\bigr)$, which [L1] makes smaller than any prescribed positive number by choosing $P$ suitably, so $\lambda f$ is integrable. [step 1.5, L1, L3, L5, L9]

2.4 With step 1.6 and [L5], $U(-f,P) = -L(f,P)$ and $L(-f,P) = -U(f,P)$, so $U(-f,P)-L(-f,P) = U(f,P)-L(f,P)$ and $-f$ is integrable by [L1]; and by [L7] applied to the sets of Darboux sums, $\overline{\int_a^b}(-f) = -\underline{\int_a^b} f$ and $\underline{\int_a^b}(-f) = -\overline{\int_a^b} f$, so $\int_a^b(-f) = -\int_a^b f$. [step 1.6, L1, L2, L5, L7]

3.1 Hence $U(f+g,P) - L(f+g,P) \le \bigl(U(f,P)-L(f,P)\bigr) + \bigl(U(g,P)-L(g,P)\bigr) < \varepsilon$, so $f+g$ is integrable by [L1], $\varepsilon > 0$ having been arbitrary. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, L1, L9]

3.2 Moreover the set of lower sums of $\lambda f$ is $\lambda$ times the set of lower sums of $f$, and a supremum scales by a positive factor, by the argument of step 1.5 applied to that set; so $\underline{\int_a^b}\lambda f = \lambda \underline{\int_a^b} f$, and likewise for the upper integrals, giving $\int_a^b \lambda f = \lambda\int_a^b f$. [step 1.5, step 2.3, L2, L6, L9]

4.1 Both $\int_a^b(f+g)$ and $\int_a^b f + \int_a^b g$ lie in the interval from $L(f,P)+L(g,P)$ to $U(f,P)+U(g,P)$: the first by [L2] and step 2.2, the second by [L2] applied to $f$ and to $g$ separately. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, L2]

4.2 **Claim 2 for $\lambda < 0$.** Then $-\lambda > 0$ and $\lambda f = (-\lambda)(-f)$, so steps 2.3, 2.4 and 3.2 give integrability and the required identities and $\int_a^b \lambda f = (-\lambda)\int_a^b(-f) = (-\lambda)\bigl(-\int_a^b f\bigr) = \lambda\int_a^b f$. [step 2.3, step 3.2, step 2.4, L9]

5.1 That interval has length less than $\varepsilon$ by step 2.1, so $\bigl|\int_a^b(f+g) - \int_a^b f - \int_a^b g\bigr| < \varepsilon$; as $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary the difference is $0$, which is claim 1. [step 2.1, step 4.1, L9]

5.2 Claim 2 is now proved in all three cases $\lambda = 0$, $\lambda > 0$ and $\lambda < 0$, which are exhaustive by trichotomy. [step 1.4, step 2.3, step 3.2, step 4.2, L9]

6.1 **Claim 3.** By claim 2 the functions $\lambda f$ and $\mu g$ are integrable with integrals $\lambda\int_a^b f$ and $\mu\int_a^b g$, and by claim 1 their sum is integrable with the sum of those integrals. [step 5.1, step 5.2]

7.1 **Claim 4.** If $u < v$ then $u, v \in [a,b]$ and claim 3 applies verbatim on $[u,v]$; if $u = v$ both sides are $0$ by [L10]; and if $u > v$ then applying the case $u < v$ to the pair $(v,u)$ and multiplying by $-1$ gives the identity, by [L10]. [step 6.1, L10] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why claim 1 cannot be an identity of Darboux sums.** The example in the statement shows $\sup(f+g) < \sup f + \sup g$ is possible on a single subinterval, so $U(f+g,P) = U(f,P)+U(g,P)$ is false in general. What survives is the pair of inequalities of step 1.2, and they are enough because the gap between them is squeezed to $0$ by [[thm-riemann-criterion]].

- **The two scalar cases really are different.** For $\lambda > 0$ the extreme values scale; for $\lambda < 0$ they are exchanged, because multiplying by a negative reverses the order ([[lem-reflection]]). Merging the cases and writing $U(\lambda f, P) = \lambda U(f,P)$ for all $\lambda$ would be false at $\lambda = -1$, where the correct identity is $U(-f,P) = -L(f,P)$.

- **The set of integrable functions on $[a,b]$ is closed under the operations named here and under more.** Products, absolute values and the lattice operations are also integrable, but none of them is obtained from linearity alone: the proofs of [[cor-integrability-of-absolute-values-products-and-lattice-operations]] all pass through [[thm-composition-with-a-continuous-function]], with linearity used only to recombine the pieces.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]). Then:

1. **Nonnegativity.** If $f(x) \ge 0$ for every $x \in [a,b]$ then
   $\int_a^b f \ge 0$.
2. **Monotonicity.** If $f(x) \le g(x)$ for every $x \in [a,b]$ then
   $$\int_a^b f \;\le\; \int_a^b g .$$
3. **Two-sided bound.** If $m \le f(x) \le M$ for every $x \in [a,b]$, with
   $m, M$ real, then
   $$m\,(b-a) \;\le\; \int_a^b f \;\le\; M\,(b-a) .$$

**Equality in claim 1 does not force $f$ to vanish.** A nonnegative integrable
function with integral $0$ may be positive at infinitely many points; that is
[[fs-nonnegative-integrable-with-zero-integral-vanishes]] on the previous page's
companion. Under the additional hypothesis of continuity the conclusion does
hold, and that is [[thm-nonnegative-continuous-with-zero-integral-vanishes]]
below.

**Claim 2 is stated for $a < b$ and is not orientation-invariant.** With the
convention of [[def-oriented-integral]], $f \le g$ gives
$\int_u^v f \le \int_u^v g$ when $u \le v$ and the reverse inequality when
$u \ge v$, since both sides change sign together.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and integrable $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, with reals $m \le M$ where claim 3 is concerned.

[A1] $f(x) \ge 0$ for every $x \in [a,b]$.

[A2] $f(x) \le g(x)$ for every $x \in [a,b]$.

[A3] $m \le f(x) \le M$ for every $x \in [a,b]$.

[L1] If $m' \le h \le M'$ on $[a,b]$ then $m'(b-a) \le L(h,P) \le \underline{\int_a^b} h \le \overline{\int_a^b} h \le U(h,P) \le M'(b-a)$ for every partition $P$ ([[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]], [[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L2] If $h$ is integrable then $\int_a^b h$ is the common value of the lower and upper integrals ([[def-darboux-integral]], [[def-infimum]]).

[L3] Sums and scalar multiples of integrable functions are integrable, and $\int_a^b(\lambda h + \nu k) = \lambda\int_a^b h + \nu\int_a^b k$ ([[thm-linearity-of-the-integral]]).

[L4] Ordered-field arithmetic: adding a constant to both sides of an inequality preserves it, and the order is total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). The nonstrict forms follow from the strict ones by adjoining the case of equality.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Claim 1.** Under [A1] the constant $0$ is a lower bound of $f$ on $[a,b]$, so [L1] applies with $m' := 0$ and gives $\underline{\int_a^b} f \ge 0$. [A1, L1]

1.2 **Claim 2.** Under [A2] the function $h := g - f$ satisfies $h(x) \ge 0$ for every $x \in [a,b]$, and $h$ is integrable with $\int_a^b h = \int_a^b g - \int_a^b f$ by [L3]. [A2, L3, L4]

2.1 Since $f$ is integrable, $\int_a^b f = \underline{\int_a^b} f \ge 0$ by [L2]. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 By claim 1 applied to $h$, $\int_a^b g - \int_a^b f \ge 0$, that is $\int_a^b f \le \int_a^b g$. [step 2.1, step 1.2, L4]

4.1 **Claim 3.** Under [A3], [L1] applied to $f$ with $m' := m$ and $M' := M$ gives $m(b-a) \le \underline{\int_a^b} f$ and $\overline{\int_a^b} f \le M(b-a)$, and both integrals equal $\int_a^b f$ by [L2]. [A3, L1, L2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Claim 3 is cited, not reproved.** [[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]] already proves the five-term chain for every partition, and it is the item that also computes the integral of a constant, $\int_a^b c = c(b-a)$. Claim 3 is that chain read at an integrable $f$; nothing new is established here.

- **Claim 2 is proved through claim 1 and linearity, and not by comparing Darboux sums.** Comparing sums works too, since $f \le g$ gives $m_i(f) \le m_i(g)$ and $M_i(f) \le M_i(g)$ on every subinterval, but the route through $g - f$ is shorter and uses only results already available. Either way the hypothesis is a pointwise inequality on the *whole* of $[a,b]$; an inequality holding off a finite set gives the same conclusion, by [[lem-changing-a-function-at-finitely-many-points]], and that is a separate statement.

- **What claim 2 is for.** It is what turns a pointwise estimate on an integrand into an estimate on the integral, and every estimate of that shape on this page and its companion is an application of it. No count of those applications is asserted here; the dependency graph of the page is where that is read off.

## Statement

Every complete ordered field $F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) is Archimedean:
for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$,
where $n \cdot 1_F$ is the canonical natural of the ordered field $F$
([[def-ordered-field]]). Equivalently, the canonical naturals are cofinal in $F$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $F$; write $A = \{\, n \cdot 1_F : n \ge 1 \,\}$ for the set of its canonical naturals.

[L1] Least-upper-bound property: every nonempty $S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound $\sup S \in F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Each canonical natural satisfies $n \cdot 1_F > 0$, one has $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L3] $0 < 1_F$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $F$ is not Archimedean: there is some $x \in F$ with $n \cdot 1_F \le x$ for all $n \ge 1$, that is, $x$ is an upper bound of $A$. [assume-contra]

2.1 The set $A$ is nonempty, since $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F \in A$, and it is bounded above by $x$. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 By the least-upper-bound property, $A$ has a least upper bound $s = \sup A \in F$. [step 2.1, L1]

4.1 Since $1_F > 0$, we have $s - 1_F < s$; as $s$ is the least upper bound, $s - 1_F$ is not an upper bound of $A$. [step 3.1, L3]

5.1 Hence there is some $m \ge 1$ with $m \cdot 1_F > s - 1_F$. [step 4.1]

6.1 Adding $1_F$ to both sides, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F > s$. [step 5.1, L2]

7.1 But $(m+1) \cdot 1_F \in A$, so $(m+1) \cdot 1_F \le s$ because $s$ is an upper bound of $A$, contradicting 6.1. [step 6.1, step 3.1, L2]

8.1 The assumption is therefore untenable, so $F$ is Archimedean. [step 7.1, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]), let $K \ge 0$ be a real with $|f(t)| \le K$ for every
$t \in [a,b]$ ([[def-bounded-set]]), and let $F$ be the integral function of $f$
([[def-the-integral-function]]). Then

$$\bigl|F(y) - F(x)\bigr| \;\le\; K\,|y - x| \qquad \text{for all } x,y \in [a,b] ,$$

that is, $F$ is Lipschitz with constant $K$ on $[a,b]$
([[def-lipschitz-holder-contraction]], [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]]).
Consequently $F$ is uniformly continuous on $[a,b]$
([[def-uniform-continuity-real]]) and hence continuous there
([[def-continuity-real]]).

**No continuity of $f$ is assumed.** This is the strongest regularity of $F$
available before the fundamental theorem, and it is what makes the hypotheses of
that theorem visible as hypotheses: continuity of $f$ at a point buys
differentiability of $F$ there, and integrability alone already buys this much
everywhere.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, an integrable $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $K \ge 0$ with $|f| \le K$ on $[a,b]$, and the integral function $F(x) = \int_a^x f$; points $x,y \in [a,b]$.

[L1] $F(y) - F(x) = \int_x^y f$ for all $x,y \in [a,b]$, in either order ([[def-the-integral-function]]).

[L2] $|f|$ is integrable on every $[p,q] \subseteq [a,b]$ with $p<q$, and $\bigl|\int_p^q f\bigr| \le \int_p^q |f|$ there ([[cor-integrability-of-absolute-values-products-and-lattice-operations]], claims 1 and 3).

[L3] If $u \le w$ pointwise on $[p,q]$ and both are integrable then $\int_p^q u \le \int_p^q w$, and $\int_p^q c = c(q-p)$ for a constant $c$ ([[thm-monotonicity-of-the-integral]], [[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]]).

[L4] With oriented limits, $\int_y^x f = -\int_x^y f$ and $\int_x^x f = 0$ ([[def-oriented-integral]]).

[L5] Absolute value: $|{-t}| = |t|$, $|t| \ge 0$, and $|t| \le c$ follows from $-c \le t \le c$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]]).

[L6] A real function on $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ satisfying $|u(x)-u(x')| \le L|x-x'|$ for all $x,x' \in A$ is Lipschitz with constant $L$ as a map of metric spaces, $\mathbb{R}$ carrying its usual metric; a Lipschitz real function is uniformly continuous, and a uniformly continuous one is continuous ([[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]], clauses 3 and 6, [[def-lipschitz-holder-contraction]], [[thm-metric-regularity-hierarchy]], [[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]).

[L7] Ordered-field arithmetic: the order is total and transitive, and multiplying an inequality by a nonnegative real preserves it ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **The case $x < y$.** By [L1], $F(y)-F(x) = \int_x^y f$, and $[x,y] \subseteq [a,b]$ with $x < y$. [given, L1]

1.2 **The case $x = y$.** Then $F(y)-F(x) = 0$ and $K|y-x| = 0$, so the inequality holds with equality. [L1, L4, L5]

2.1 On $[x,y]$ one has $|f(t)| \le K$ for every $t$, so by [L2] and [L3], $\bigl|\int_x^y f\bigr| \le \int_x^y |f| \le \int_x^y K = K\,(y-x)$. [step 1.1, given, L2, L3]

3.1 Hence $|F(y)-F(x)| \le K(y-x) = K|y-x|$ when $x < y$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L5]

4.1 **The case $y < x$.** Applying step 3.1 to the pair $(y,x)$ gives $|F(x)-F(y)| \le K|x-y|$, and $|F(y)-F(x)| = |F(x)-F(y)|$ with $|y-x| = |x-y|$ by [L5]; so the inequality holds here too. [step 3.1, L5]

5.1 The three cases $x<y$, $x=y$, $y<x$ are exhaustive by [L7], so $|F(y)-F(x)| \le K|y-x|$ for all $x,y \in [a,b]$. [step 1.2, step 3.1, step 4.1, L7]

6.1 By [L6], $F$ is therefore Lipschitz with constant $K$ on $[a,b]$, hence uniformly continuous on $[a,b]$, hence continuous there. [step 5.1, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- **The estimate is written out on both sides of the diagonal.** Hiding the case $y < x$ inside the absolute value would conceal the fact that $\int_x^y f$ is then the *oriented* integral of [[def-oriented-integral]], and that the published inequality $\bigl|\int_p^q f\bigr| \le \int_p^q|f|$ is available only for $p \le q$. Step 4.1 is what pays for that.

- **The constant is any bound on $|f|$, and it need not be sharp.** If $f$ is integrable then it is bounded by definition of the Darboux sums, so some $K$ exists; the theorem is stated with $K$ given rather than existentially, because every later use supplies its own bound.

- **The dictionary lemma is cited on purpose.** Lipschitz and uniform continuity are defined in this library both for real functions and for maps of metric spaces, and [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]] is the single item recording that the two families of notions coincide. Citing it, rather than proving the implication again, is what keeps the library from carrying two notions of continuity.
