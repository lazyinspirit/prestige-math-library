# Proof-refuter brief — run `zfc`, step 6

You are a **read-only adversarial proof-refuter** for a public mathematics
library. You have no filesystem and no web access: **everything you may rely on
is in the "This dispatch" section below.** Do not assume any fact about an item
that is not reproduced there.

You are reading **draft** content at the very bottom of the library — the ZFC
axioms and the set-theoretic treatment of relations and functions. Everything
above rests on it, so a wrong step here is inherited by thousands of results.
This material is elementary, which makes it easy to wave through. Do not.

## Your standard

Read the target item's **Statement/Definition/Example**, its **Facts &
Assumptions** block, and **every numbered step of its Proof / Verification /
Refutation** as someone trying to break it. For each step ask:

1. Does the cited material **mathematically license exactly what the step
   claims** — no more? The dominant defect class in this corpus is a fact
   restated more strongly than its source supports.
2. Is each `[F#]`/`[L#]` fact a **faithful** rendering of the dependency it
   names? Compare it against the dependency's full text, which is supplied.
   Check domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, direction, and conclusion. An invented
   converse is fatal.
3. Does the **title or Statement assert more than the proof delivers**? A judge
   who reads only the Statement cannot see a false title, so you must.
4. **Boundary cases.** The empty set, the empty family, the empty relation,
   functions out of and into $\varnothing$, $\mathcal{P}(\varnothing)$,
   $A \times \varnothing$, $\bigcap\varnothing$, zero- and one-element index
   sets, and **both directions of every "if and only if"**. This is where this
   material ships falsehoods.
5. **Circularity.** Does a proof use, directly or through a cited fact, the very
   thing it is establishing — or a result that is itself proved from it? Two such
   defects were already found on these pages.

## What counts, and what does not

- **Report** a concrete false claim, an unlicensed inference, a missing
  hypothesis, an inaccurate or overstated citation, a boundary case the proof
  silently assumes away, or a circularity. Name the exact step or fact and say
  **why**, with the counterexample or the missing hypothesis made explicit.
- **Do not report** a gap a competent reader closes in 30 seconds, a stylistic
  preference, a suggestion to add exposition, or a complaint that a step is
  "not fully rigorous" without naming what is actually wrong.
- Before alleging a cited dependency is too weak, **read the dependency text
  supplied below**. If it does support the step, say so.

You return **evidence, never edits**. You do not have write access and must not
propose file changes. An adjudicator reads your findings against the real files
and decides.

## Output format

Reply with exactly this structure, and nothing else:

```
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

Then, if `DEFECTS`, one block per finding:

```
FINDING 1
  location: [the exact step number, fact label, title, or Statement]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [what the item asserts there]
  defect:   [precisely what is wrong, with the counterexample or missing hypothesis]
```

Then always, last:

```
BOUNDARY: [one line per boundary case you checked and its disposition]
CHECKED:  [one line confirming you read every numbered step and every cited fact]
```

Be terse. No preamble, no summary of the mathematics, no praise.

## Statement

Assume the Axiom of Foundation. Then:

- (i) $x \notin x$ for every set $x$;
- (ii) there are no sets $x$ and $y$ with $x \in y$ and $y \in x$;
- (iii) there are no sets $x$, $y$ and $z$ with $x \in y$, $y \in z$ and $z \in x$.

Cycles of length greater than three are not treated here: stating "there is no
membership cycle of any finite length" needs a finite sequence, that is a
function on a natural number, and neither notion is available at this point in
the reading order.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** the Axiom of Foundation.

[L1] Every set with at least one member has a member $s$ that shares no member with it ([[def-axiom-of-foundation]]).

[L2] $\{x,y\}$ is the set whose elements are exactly $x$ and $y$, and $\{x\} := \{x,x\}$ ([[def-unordered-pair-and-singleton]]).

[L3] $z \in a \cup b$ holds if and only if $z \in a$ or $z \in b$ ([[lem-unions-and-intersections-of-small-families]]).

[L4] $a \cup b := \bigcup\{a,b\}$ ([[def-union-of-a-set-and-binary-union]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose the statement fails, so that at least one of the following holds: there is a set $x$ with $x \in x$; there are sets $x$ and $y$ with $x \in y$ and $y \in x$; there are sets $x$, $y$ and $z$ with $x \in y$, $y \in z$ and $z \in x$. [assume-contra]

2.1 Suppose $x \in x$ and put $S := \{x\}$. Its only member is $x$, so $S$ has a member and Foundation applies; the member it supplies must be $x$, so $x$ shares no member with $S$. But $x \in x$ and $x \in S$, so $x$ is a member of both. [L1, L2, step 1.1]

2.2 Suppose $x \in y$ and $y \in x$, and put $S := \{x,y\}$. Foundation supplies a member of $S$ sharing no member with $S$, and that member is $x$ or $y$. If it is $x$, then $y \in x$ and $y \in S$ make $y$ a member of both; if it is $y$, then $x \in y$ and $x \in S$ make $x$ a member of both. [L1, L2, step 1.1]

2.3 Suppose $x \in y$, $y \in z$ and $z \in x$, and put $S := \{x,y\} \cup \{z\}$, whose members are exactly $x$, $y$ and $z$. Foundation supplies a member of $S$ sharing no member with $S$. If it is $x$, then $z \in x$ and $z \in S$; if it is $y$, then $x \in y$ and $x \in S$; if it is $z$, then $y \in z$ and $y \in S$. In each case that member shares a member with $S$. [L1, L2, L3, L4, step 1.1]

3.1 Each of the three suppositions contradicts the member Foundation supplies, so none of them holds: $x \notin x$ for every $x$, no sets satisfy $x \in y \in x$, and no sets satisfy $x \in y \in z \in x$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Definition

The **Axiom of Foundation**, also called the Axiom of Regularity, is the sentence

$$\forall S\,\Bigl(\exists t\,(t \in S) \to \exists s\,\bigl(s \in S \wedge \neg\exists u\,(u \in s \wedge u \in S)\bigr)\Bigr)$$

of the language of set theory ([[def-language-of-set-theory]]): every set with at
least one member has a member $s$ that shares no member with it.

It is written here without abbreviations, for the same reason as
[[def-axiom-of-infinity]]: the usual statement uses notation introduced later on
this page. In that notation it reads: every nonempty set $S$ has a member $s$
with $s \cap S = \varnothing$. Such an $s$ is called an
$\in$-**minimal** member of $S$.

## Remarks

- **What it rules out.** A set $S$ that had no $\in$-minimal member would let one
  descend forever through membership. The axiom forbids that, and
  [[thm-foundation-excludes-membership-cycles]] draws the consequences that this
  page needs: no set is a member of itself, and there is no membership cycle of
  length two or three.

- **It is used nowhere else on this page.** Every other construction below is
  carried out without it; the ledger at
  [[rem-which-axiom-each-construction-uses]] records exactly which results depend
  on it.

## Definition

Let $x$ and $y$ be sets. [[def-axiom-of-pairing]] gives a set whose elements are
exactly $x$ and $y$, and [[def-axiom-of-extensionality]] shows there is only one
such set; it is written $\{x,y\}$. Thus $\{x,y\}$ is the set whose elements are
exactly $x$ and $y$, and $\{x\} := \{x,x\}$, the **singleton** of $x$, is the set
whose only element is $x$:

$$t \in \{x,y\} \leftrightarrow (t = x \vee t = y), \qquad t \in \{x\} \leftrightarrow t = x .$$

## Remarks

- **The pair is unordered.** $t = x \vee t = y$ and $t = y \vee t = x$ are the
  same condition, so $\{x,y\} = \{y,x\}$, and the notation records no order.
  [[lem-unordered-pair-equality]] says exactly how much information a pair does
  carry, and [[def-ordered-pair]] is the construction that recovers an order from
  unordered pairs alone.

- **A singleton is not its element.** $\{x\}$ has exactly one element, namely
  $x$, and $x$ and $\{x\}$ are different sets whenever they have different
  elements; $\{\varnothing\}$ has one element while $\varnothing$ has none, so
  the two are already distinct at the bottom of the hierarchy.

## Definition

Let $x$ be a set. [[def-axiom-of-union]] gives a set whose elements are exactly
the sets $z$ belonging to some member of $x$, and [[def-axiom-of-extensionality]]
shows there is only one such set; it is written $\bigcup x$. Thus $\bigcup x$ is
the set whose elements are exactly the elements of the elements of $x$, and
$a \cup b := \bigcup\{a,b\}$ is the **binary union** of $a$ and $b$, formed from
the unordered pair of [[def-unordered-pair-and-singleton]]:

$$z \in \bigcup x \leftrightarrow \exists s\,(s \in x \wedge z \in s).$$

The membership criterion for the binary union, that $z \in a \cup b$ holds
exactly when $z \in a$ or $z \in b$, is proved at
[[lem-unions-and-intersections-of-small-families]] rather than assumed here.

## Remarks

- **One layer only.** $\bigcup x$ collects the elements of the elements of $x$,
  not the elements of $x$. For a set of sets of sets the operation therefore has
  to be applied twice, and that iteration is what makes
  $\bigcup\bigcup R$ the right ambient set for the domain and range of a
  relation.

- **Notation.** $\bigcup$ with a single set argument is the primitive operation
  supplied by the axiom; $\cup$ between two sets is the derived binary one. The
  indexed form $\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i$ is a further abbreviation, defined once
  indexed families are available.

## Statement

For all sets $a$ and $b$:

- (i) $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$;
- (ii) $\bigcup \{a\} = a$;
- (iii) $\bigcup \{a,b\} = a \cup b$, and $z \in a \cup b$ holds if and only if $z \in a$ or $z \in b$;
- (iv) $\bigcap \{a\} = a$;
- (v) $\bigcap \{a,b\} = a \cap b$, and $z \in a \cap b$ holds if and only if $z \in a$ and $z \in b$.

The equalities in (iii) and (v) are the definitions of $a \cup b$ and $a \cap b$
written out; what is proved about them here is the membership criterion beside
each.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** sets $a$ and $b$.

[L1] $\bigcup x$ is the set whose elements are exactly the elements of the elements of $x$, and $a \cup b := \bigcup\{a,b\}$ ([[def-union-of-a-set-and-binary-union]]).

[L2] For $x \neq \varnothing$, $\bigcap x$ is the set whose elements are exactly the sets belonging to every element of $x$, and $a \cap b := \bigcap\{a,b\}$ ([[def-intersection-of-a-set-and-binary-intersection]]).

[L3] $\{x,y\}$ is the set whose elements are exactly $x$ and $y$, and $\{x\} := \{x,x\}$ ([[def-unordered-pair-and-singleton]]).

[L4] There is exactly one set with no elements, written $\varnothing$ ([[thm-the-empty-set-exists-and-is-unique]]).

[L5] If every $z$ satisfies $z \in x$ if and only if $z \in y$, then $x = y$ ([[def-axiom-of-extensionality]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Claim (i): $z \in \bigcup \varnothing$ requires a member $s$ of $\varnothing$ with $z \in s$, and $\varnothing$ has no members, so $\bigcup \varnothing$ has no elements and is therefore $\varnothing$. [L1, L4]

1.2 Claim (ii): $z \in \bigcup \{a\}$ requires a member $s$ of $\{a\}$ with $z \in s$, and the only member of $\{a\}$ is $a$, so $z \in \bigcup\{a\}$ holds exactly when $z \in a$. [L1, L3]

1.3 Claim (iii): $a \cup b$ is $\bigcup\{a,b\}$ by definition, and $z \in \bigcup\{a,b\}$ requires a member $s$ of $\{a,b\}$ with $z \in s$; the members of $\{a,b\}$ are $a$ and $b$, so $z \in a \cup b$ holds exactly when $z \in a$ or $z \in b$. [L1, L3]

1.4 Claim (iv): $\{a\}$ is nonempty since $a$ is a member, and $z \in \bigcap\{a\}$ holds exactly when $z$ belongs to every member of $\{a\}$, that is, exactly when $z \in a$. [L2, L3]

1.5 Claim (v): $a \cap b$ is $\bigcap\{a,b\}$ by definition, $\{a,b\}$ is nonempty, and $z \in \bigcap\{a,b\}$ holds exactly when $z$ belongs to every member of $\{a,b\}$; the members are $a$ and $b$, so $z \in a \cap b$ holds exactly when $z \in a$ and $z \in b$. [L2, L3]

2.1 In each of the five claims the elements of the two sides have been shown to satisfy the same condition, so the sets are equal, which is the statement. [L5, step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, step 1.4, step 1.5] ∎
