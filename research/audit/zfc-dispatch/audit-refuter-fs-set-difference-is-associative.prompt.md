# Proof-refuter brief — run `zfc`, step 6

You are a **read-only adversarial proof-refuter** for a public mathematics
library. You have no filesystem and no web access: **everything you may rely on
is in the "This dispatch" section below.** Do not assume any fact about an item
that is not reproduced there.

You are reading **draft** content at the very bottom of the library — the ZFC
axioms and the set-theoretic treatment of relations and functions. Everything
above rests on it, so a wrong step here is inherited by thousands of results.
This material is elementary, which makes it easy to wave through. Do not.

## Your standard

Read the target item's **Statement/Definition/Example**, its **Facts &
Assumptions** block, and **every numbered step of its Proof / Verification /
Refutation** as someone trying to break it. For each step ask:

1. Does the cited material **mathematically license exactly what the step
   claims** — no more? The dominant defect class in this corpus is a fact
   restated more strongly than its source supports.
2. Is each `[F#]`/`[L#]` fact a **faithful** rendering of the dependency it
   names? Compare it against the dependency's full text, which is supplied.
   Check domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, direction, and conclusion. An invented
   converse is fatal.
3. Does the **title or Statement assert more than the proof delivers**? A judge
   who reads only the Statement cannot see a false title, so you must.
4. **Boundary cases.** The empty set, the empty family, the empty relation,
   functions out of and into $\varnothing$, $\mathcal{P}(\varnothing)$,
   $A \times \varnothing$, $\bigcap\varnothing$, zero- and one-element index
   sets, and **both directions of every "if and only if"**. This is where this
   material ships falsehoods.
5. **Circularity.** Does a proof use, directly or through a cited fact, the very
   thing it is establishing — or a result that is itself proved from it? Two such
   defects were already found on these pages.

## What counts, and what does not

- **Report** a concrete false claim, an unlicensed inference, a missing
  hypothesis, an inaccurate or overstated citation, a boundary case the proof
  silently assumes away, or a circularity. Name the exact step or fact and say
  **why**, with the counterexample or the missing hypothesis made explicit.
- **Do not report** a gap a competent reader closes in 30 seconds, a stylistic
  preference, a suggestion to add exposition, or a complaint that a step is
  "not fully rigorous" without naming what is actually wrong.
- Before alleging a cited dependency is too weak, **read the dependency text
  supplied below**. If it does support the step, say so.

You return **evidence, never edits**. You do not have write access and must not
propose file changes. An adjudicator reads your findings against the real files
and decides.

## Output format

Reply with exactly this structure, and nothing else:

```
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

Then, if `DEFECTS`, one block per finding:

```
FINDING 1
  location: [the exact step number, fact label, title, or Statement]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [what the item asserts there]
  defect:   [precisely what is wrong, with the counterexample or missing hypothesis]
```

Then always, last:

```
BOUNDARY: [one line per boundary case you checked and its disposition]
CHECKED:  [one line confirming you read every numbered step and every cited fact]
```

Be terse. No preamble, no summary of the mathematics, no praise.

## Statement

**False statement.** Set difference is associative: for all sets $a$, $b$, $c$,

$$(a \setminus b) \setminus c = a \setminus (b \setminus c).$$

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** the claim above, and the sets $a = b = c := \{\varnothing\}$.

[L1] $z \in a \setminus b$ holds exactly when $z \in a$ and $z \notin b$ ([[def-set-difference-and-symmetric-difference]]).

[L2] $\{x\} := \{x,x\}$, the **singleton** of $x$, is the set whose only element is $x$ ([[def-unordered-pair-and-singleton]]).

[L3] There is exactly one set with no elements, written $\varnothing$ ([[thm-the-empty-set-exists-and-is-unique]]).

[L4] If every $z$ satisfies $z \in x$ if and only if $z \in y$, then $x = y$ ([[def-axiom-of-extensionality]]).

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Take $a = b = c := \{\varnothing\}$. [given]

2.1 $a \setminus b$ has no elements, since $z \in a \setminus b$ requires $z \in a$ and $z \notin b$ while $a$ and $b$ are the same set; so $a \setminus b = \varnothing$, and $(a \setminus b) \setminus c$ likewise has no elements and equals $\varnothing$. [L1, L3, L4, step 1.1]

2.2 By the same computation $b \setminus c = \varnothing$, and $z \in a \setminus \varnothing$ requires only $z \in a$, so $a \setminus (b \setminus c) = a = \{\varnothing\}$. [L1, L3, L4, step 1.1]

3.1 The two sides are $\varnothing$ and $\{\varnothing\}$, which differ because the second has an element and the first has none; the claim is therefore false. [L2, L3, step 2.1, step 2.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the two sides part company here.** On the left, removing $b$ from $a$ already empties it, so the outer difference can only be empty. On the right, $b \setminus c$ is empty, so nothing at all is removed from $a$. One nonempty set playing all three roles makes both collapses happen at once.

## Definition

Let $a$ and $b$ be sets. The **difference** of $a$ and $b$ is

$$a \setminus b := \{\, z \in a : z \notin b \,\},$$

a set by [[def-axiom-schema-of-separation]] and the only one with those elements
by [[def-axiom-of-extensionality]]; so $z \in a \setminus b$ holds exactly when
$z \in a$ and $z \notin b$. The **symmetric difference** is

$$a \triangle b := (a \setminus b) \cup (b \setminus a),$$

formed with the binary union of [[def-union-of-a-set-and-binary-union]].

When $a \subseteq X$ ([[def-subset-and-proper-subset]]), the difference
$X \setminus a$ is called the **complement of $a$ relative to $X$**. The
qualification is not optional: there is no set of all sets
([[cor-there-is-no-set-of-all-sets]]), so an absolute complement, the class of
all sets not in $a$, is never a set.

## Remarks

- **Difference needs no hypothesis.** $a \setminus b$ is defined for all sets
  $a$ and $b$, with no assumption that $b \subseteq a$ or that the two meet.
  When they are disjoint, $a \setminus b = a$.

- **Symmetric difference collects what lies in exactly one of the two sets.**
  Unfolding the definition, $z \in a \triangle b$ holds exactly when $z$ belongs
  to $a$ or to $b$ but not to both.

## Definition

Let $x$ and $y$ be sets. [[def-axiom-of-pairing]] gives a set whose elements are
exactly $x$ and $y$, and [[def-axiom-of-extensionality]] shows there is only one
such set; it is written $\{x,y\}$. Thus $\{x,y\}$ is the set whose elements are
exactly $x$ and $y$, and $\{x\} := \{x,x\}$, the **singleton** of $x$, is the set
whose only element is $x$:

$$t \in \{x,y\} \leftrightarrow (t = x \vee t = y), \qquad t \in \{x\} \leftrightarrow t = x .$$

## Remarks

- **The pair is unordered.** $t = x \vee t = y$ and $t = y \vee t = x$ are the
  same condition, so $\{x,y\} = \{y,x\}$, and the notation records no order.
  [[lem-unordered-pair-equality]] says exactly how much information a pair does
  carry, and [[def-ordered-pair]] is the construction that recovers an order from
  unordered pairs alone.

- **A singleton is not its element.** $\{x\}$ has exactly one element, namely
  $x$, and $x$ and $\{x\}$ are different sets whenever they have different
  elements; $\{\varnothing\}$ has one element while $\varnothing$ has none, so
  the two are already distinct at the bottom of the hierarchy.

## Statement

There is exactly one set with no elements: there is a set $e$ such that
$\neg\exists z\,(z \in e)$, and any two such sets are equal. That set is written
$\varnothing$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** the language of set theory, in which the domain of discourse is nonempty ([[def-language-of-set-theory]]).

[L1] For any parameters $\bar p$ and any set $x$, there is a set $y$ whose elements are exactly the elements $z$ of $x$ for which $\varphi(z,\bar p)$ holds ([[def-axiom-schema-of-separation]]).

[L2] If every $z$ satisfies $z \in x$ if and only if $z \in y$, then $x = y$ ([[def-axiom-of-extensionality]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The domain of discourse is nonempty, so fix a set $a$. [given, choose]

2.1 Apply Separation to $a$ with the formula $\varphi(z) := \neg(z = z)$: there is a set $e$ such that, for every $z$, $z \in e$ holds if and only if $z \in a$ and $\neg(z = z)$. [L1, step 1.1]

3.1 No $z$ satisfies $\neg(z = z)$, so no $z$ satisfies $z \in e$; hence $e$ is a set with no elements, which proves existence. [step 2.1]

4.1 If $e'$ is also a set with no elements, then $z \in e$ and $z \in e'$ both fail for every $z$, so $z \in e$ holds if and only if $z \in e'$, and therefore $e = e'$; existence and uniqueness together give the statement, and $\varnothing$ denotes this set. [L2, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Existence is derived, not assumed.** Several presentations take "there is a set with no elements" as an axiom of its own. Here it is a theorem, because the nonemptiness of the domain of discourse is already a validity of first-order logic and Separation converts any set whatever into this one.

## Definition

The **Axiom of Extensionality** is the sentence

$$\forall x\,\forall y\,\bigl(\forall z\,(z \in x \leftrightarrow z \in y) \to x = y\bigr)$$

of the language of set theory ([[def-language-of-set-theory]]): if every $z$
satisfies $z \in x$ if and only if $z \in y$, then $x = y$.

A set is therefore determined by its members and by nothing else. Order,
repetition and any description used to present a set are invisible to identity.

## Remarks

- **The converse is logic, not an axiom.** If $x = y$ then $z \in x$ and
  $z \in y$ are the same statement for every $z$, by the substitution rule for
  equality. So Extensionality upgrades to the biconditional
  $x = y \leftrightarrow \forall z\,(z \in x \leftrightarrow z \in y)$, and only
  the left-to-right direction of that biconditional is assumed.

- **What it is used for below.** Every construction on this page produces a set
  by an axiom that specifies its members, and every such axiom is stated with
  $\leftrightarrow$. Extensionality is what turns "a set with these members" into
  "*the* set with these members", so it is the licence for each definite article
  and each piece of notation introduced here.
