# Proof-refuter brief — run `zfc`, step 6

You are a **read-only adversarial proof-refuter** for a public mathematics
library. You have no filesystem and no web access: **everything you may rely on
is in the "This dispatch" section below.** Do not assume any fact about an item
that is not reproduced there.

You are reading **draft** content at the very bottom of the library — the ZFC
axioms and the set-theoretic treatment of relations and functions. Everything
above rests on it, so a wrong step here is inherited by thousands of results.
This material is elementary, which makes it easy to wave through. Do not.

## Your standard

Read the target item's **Statement/Definition/Example**, its **Facts &
Assumptions** block, and **every numbered step of its Proof / Verification /
Refutation** as someone trying to break it. For each step ask:

1. Does the cited material **mathematically license exactly what the step
   claims** — no more? The dominant defect class in this corpus is a fact
   restated more strongly than its source supports.
2. Is each `[F#]`/`[L#]` fact a **faithful** rendering of the dependency it
   names? Compare it against the dependency's full text, which is supplied.
   Check domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, direction, and conclusion. An invented
   converse is fatal.
3. Does the **title or Statement assert more than the proof delivers**? A judge
   who reads only the Statement cannot see a false title, so you must.
4. **Boundary cases.** The empty set, the empty family, the empty relation,
   functions out of and into $\varnothing$, $\mathcal{P}(\varnothing)$,
   $A \times \varnothing$, $\bigcap\varnothing$, zero- and one-element index
   sets, and **both directions of every "if and only if"**. This is where this
   material ships falsehoods.
5. **Circularity.** Does a proof use, directly or through a cited fact, the very
   thing it is establishing — or a result that is itself proved from it? Two such
   defects were already found on these pages.

## What counts, and what does not

- **Report** a concrete false claim, an unlicensed inference, a missing
  hypothesis, an inaccurate or overstated citation, a boundary case the proof
  silently assumes away, or a circularity. Name the exact step or fact and say
  **why**, with the counterexample or the missing hypothesis made explicit.
- **Do not report** a gap a competent reader closes in 30 seconds, a stylistic
  preference, a suggestion to add exposition, or a complaint that a step is
  "not fully rigorous" without naming what is actually wrong.
- Before alleging a cited dependency is too weak, **read the dependency text
  supplied below**. If it does support the step, say so.

You return **evidence, never edits**. You do not have write access and must not
propose file changes. An adjudicator reads your findings against the real files
and decides.

## Output format

Reply with exactly this structure, and nothing else:

```
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

Then, if `DEFECTS`, one block per finding:

```
FINDING 1
  location: [the exact step number, fact label, title, or Statement]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [what the item asserts there]
  defect:   [precisely what is wrong, with the counterexample or missing hypothesis]
```

Then always, last:

```
BOUNDARY: [one line per boundary case you checked and its disposition]
CHECKED:  [one line confirming you read every numbered step and every cited fact]
```

Be terse. No preamble, no summary of the mathematics, no praise.

## Example

Write $u := \varnothing$, $v := \{\varnothing\}$ and
$w := \{\varnothing,\{\varnothing\}\}$; these are pairwise distinct, since $u$
has no element, $v$ has exactly the element $u$, and $w$ has $v$ as an element
while $v$ does not. Put $A := \{u,v\} \cup \{w\}$ and

$$R := \{(u,v),(v,w)\} \cup \{(w,u),(u,u)\}.$$

Then $R$ is a relation on $A$ with

$$\operatorname{dom} R = \operatorname{ran} R = \operatorname{fld} R = A, \qquad R^{-1} = \{(v,u),(w,v)\} \cup \{(u,w),(u,u)\},$$

$$R \restriction \{u\} = \{(u,v),(u,u)\}, \qquad R[\{u\} \cup \{v\}] = A, \qquad R \circ R = \{(u,w),(u,v)\} \cup \{(u,u),(v,u)\} \cup \{(w,v),(w,u)\}.$$

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $u := \varnothing$, $v := \{\varnothing\}$, $w := \{\varnothing,\{\varnothing\}\}$, $A := \{u,v\} \cup \{w\}$ and $R$ as displayed.

[L1] A **relation** is a set $R$ every element of which is an ordered pair ([[def-relation-domain-range-and-field]]).

[L2] $\operatorname{dom} R := \{\, a : \exists b\ (a,b) \in R \,\}, \qquad \operatorname{ran} R := \{\, b : \exists a\ (a,b) \in R \,\}$ ([[def-relation-domain-range-and-field]]).

[L3] $(b,a) \in R^{-1}$ holds if and only if $(a,b) \in R$; $(a,c) \in S \circ R$ holds if and only if $(a,b) \in R$ and $(b,c) \in S$ for some $b$; and $(a,b) \in R \restriction A$ holds if and only if $(a,b) \in R$ and $a \in A$ ([[def-inverse-relation-composition-and-restriction]]).

[L4] $b \in R[A]$ holds if and only if $(a,b) \in R$ for some $a \in A$ ([[def-image-and-preimage-under-a-relation]]).

[L5] $(a,b) = (c,d)$ if and only if $a = c$ and $b = d$ ([[thm-the-characterising-property-of-ordered-pairs]]).

[L6] $(a,b) := \{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$ ([[def-ordered-pair]]).

[L7] $\{x,y\}$ is the set whose elements are exactly $x$ and $y$, and $\{x\} := \{x,x\}$ ([[def-unordered-pair-and-singleton]]).

[L8] There is exactly one set with no elements, written $\varnothing$ ([[thm-the-empty-set-exists-and-is-unique]]).

[L9] $z \in a \cup b$ holds if and only if $z \in a$ or $z \in b$ ([[lem-unions-and-intersections-of-small-families]]).

[L10] $z \in A \times B$ holds if and only if $z = (a,b)$ for some $a \in A$ and some $b \in B$ ([[def-cartesian-product]]).

[L11] If every $z$ satisfies $z \in x$ if and only if $z \in y$, then $x = y$ ([[def-axiom-of-extensionality]]).

[L12] $a \cup b := \bigcup\{a,b\}$ ([[def-union-of-a-set-and-binary-union]]).

## Verification

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $u$, $v$ and $w$ are pairwise distinct and $A$ has exactly them as elements; every element of $R$ is an ordered pair with both coordinates in $A$, so $R$ is a relation on $A$, that is $R \subseteq A \times A$. [L1, L6, L7, L8, L9, L10, L12]

2.1 Reading off first coordinates gives $u$, $v$, $w$, so $\operatorname{dom} R = A$; reading off second coordinates gives $v$, $w$, $u$, so $\operatorname{ran} R = A$; and the field, being the union of the two, is $A$ as well. [L2, L5, L9, L11, step 1.1]

2.2 Reversing each pair gives $R^{-1} = \{(v,u),(w,v)\} \cup \{(u,w),(u,u)\}$; keeping the pairs whose first coordinate is $u$ gives $R \restriction \{u\} = \{(u,v),(u,u)\}$; and the elements related to $u$ or to $v$ are $v$, $u$ and $w$, so $R[\{u\} \cup \{v\}] = A$. [L3, L4, L5, L7, L9, L11, step 1.1]

2.3 For the self-composite, each pair $(a,b)$ of $R$ is matched with every pair of $R$ whose first coordinate is $b$: from $(u,v)$ and $(v,w)$ comes $(u,w)$; from $(u,u)$ and the two pairs starting at $u$ come $(u,v)$ and $(u,u)$; from $(v,w)$ and $(w,u)$ comes $(v,u)$; and from $(w,u)$ and the two pairs starting at $u$ come $(w,v)$ and $(w,u)$. These six pairs are exactly the displayed $R \circ R$. [L3, L5, L9, L11, step 1.1]

3.1 The domain, range, field, inverse, restriction, image and self-composite are as displayed. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3] ∎

## Definition

A **relation** is a set $R$ every element of which is an ordered pair
([[def-ordered-pair]]). We write $a\,R\,b$ for $(a,b) \in R$.

By [[lem-the-domain-and-range-of-a-relation-are-sets]] the following two classes
are sets, so the notation is legitimate:

$$\operatorname{dom} R := \{\, a : \exists b\ (a,b) \in R \,\}, \qquad \operatorname{ran} R := \{\, b : \exists a\ (a,b) \in R \,\},$$

the **domain** and the **range** of $R$. The **field** of $R$ is
$\operatorname{fld} R := \operatorname{dom} R \cup \operatorname{ran} R$
([[def-union-of-a-set-and-binary-union]]).

$R$ is a **relation from $A$ to $B$** when $R \subseteq A \times B$
([[def-cartesian-product]], [[def-subset-and-proper-subset]]), and a **relation
on $A$** when $R \subseteq A \times A$.

## Remarks

- **Domain and range are intrinsic; the sets $A$ and $B$ are not.** A relation
  determines its own domain and range, but it is a relation from $A$ to $B$ for
  many different $A$ and $B$: any $A$ containing $\operatorname{dom} R$ and any
  $B$ containing $\operatorname{ran} R$ will do. That is the content of
  [[lem-a-relation-is-included-in-the-product-of-its-domain-and-range]], and it
  is the same distinction that makes a codomain part of the declaration
  $f : A \to B$ rather than of the set $f$ in [[def-function]].

- **The empty set is a relation.** It has no elements, so the requirement that
  every element be an ordered pair holds vacuously, and
  $\operatorname{dom} \varnothing = \operatorname{ran} \varnothing = \varnothing$.
  It is a relation on every set.

## Definition

Let $R$ and $S$ be relations ([[def-relation-domain-range-and-field]]) and let
$A$ be a set. By
[[lem-inverse-relations-composites-and-restrictions-are-sets]] the three
collections below are sets, and each is again a relation, since each of its
elements is an ordered pair ([[def-ordered-pair]]):

- the **inverse** $R^{-1} := \{\,(b,a) : (a,b) \in R\,\}$;
- the **composite** $S \circ R := \{\,(a,c) : \exists b\ ((a,b) \in R \wedge (b,c) \in S)\,\}$;
- the **restriction** $R \restriction A := \{\,(a,b) \in R : a \in A\,\}$.

Membership in each is exactly as written: $(b,a) \in R^{-1}$ holds if and only if
$(a,b) \in R$; $(a,c) \in S \circ R$ holds if and only if $(a,b) \in R$ and
$(b,c) \in S$ for some $b$; and $(a,b) \in R \restriction A$ holds if and only if
$(a,b) \in R$ and $a \in A$.

## Remarks

- **The order in $S \circ R$.** $S \circ R$ applies $R$ first and $S$ second.
  This is the convention that makes the composite of functions read
  $(g \circ f)(x) = g(f(x))$, and it is the one the rest of the library uses.
  The opposite convention exists in the literature and would reverse every
  composite written here.

- **Restriction cuts the domain, not the range.** $R \restriction A$ keeps the
  pairs of $R$ whose first coordinate lies in $A$ and discards the rest;
  $A$ need not be included in $\operatorname{dom} R$, and
  $\operatorname{dom}(R \restriction A) = \operatorname{dom} R \cap A$.

## Definition

Let $R$ be a relation ([[def-relation-domain-range-and-field]]) and let $A$ and
$B$ be sets. The **image of $A$ under $R$** and the **preimage of $B$ under $R$**
are

$$R[A] := \{\, b \in \operatorname{ran} R : \exists a\ (a \in A \wedge (a,b) \in R) \,\}, \qquad R^{-1}[B] := \{\, a \in \operatorname{dom} R : \exists b\ (b \in B \wedge (a,b) \in R) \,\},$$

sets by [[def-axiom-schema-of-separation]] applied inside $\operatorname{ran} R$
and $\operatorname{dom} R$ respectively. Thus $b \in R[A]$ holds if and only if
$(a,b) \in R$ for some $a \in A$, and $a \in R^{-1}[B]$ holds if and only if
$(a,b) \in R$ for some $b \in B$ ([[def-ordered-pair]]).

The notation is consistent: applying the first clause to the inverse relation
$R^{-1}$ of [[def-inverse-relation-composition-and-restriction]] gives
$R^{-1}[B] = \{\, a \in \operatorname{ran}(R^{-1}) : \exists b\ (b \in B \wedge (b,a) \in R^{-1}) \,\}$,
which has exactly the elements just described, since $(b,a) \in R^{-1}$ says
$(a,b) \in R$ and $\operatorname{ran}(R^{-1}) = \operatorname{dom} R$.

## Remarks

- **The bracket is not an application.** $R[A]$ is the set of things related to
  something in $A$; it is written with square brackets precisely so that it is
  never confused with a value $R(a)$, which for a general relation does not
  exist. Even for a function, $f[S]$ and $f(S)$ mean different things, and only
  the bracket form is used here.

- **Image and range.** Taking $A := \operatorname{dom} R$ gives
  $R[\operatorname{dom} R] = \operatorname{ran} R$, and taking $A := \varnothing$
  gives $R[\varnothing] = \varnothing$, since no $a$ lies in $\varnothing$.

## Definition

For sets $a$ and $b$, the **ordered pair** $(a,b)$ is the set

$$(a,b) := \{\{a\},\{a,b\}\},$$

formed from the unordered pairs and singletons of
[[def-unordered-pair-and-singleton]]; three applications of
[[def-axiom-of-pairing]] produce it. The first coordinate is $a$ and the second
is $b$.

When $a = b$ the two members coincide, since $\{a,b\} = \{a,a\} = \{a\}$, and the
pair degenerates to $(a,a) = \{\{a\}\}$.

## Remarks

- **Why this set and not another.** An ordered pair is required to satisfy one
  property, that $(a,b) = (c,d)$ exactly when $a = c$ and $b = d$; that is
  [[thm-the-characterising-property-of-ordered-pairs]], and it is the only thing
  any later construction uses. Other definitions with the same property exist,
  and nothing below distinguishes them from this one.

- **The degenerate case is where a careless proof fails.** An argument that
  treats $\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$ as a set with two distinct members breaks at
  $a = b$, and that case has to be handled separately in the proof of the
  characterising property.

## Definition

Let $x$ and $y$ be sets. [[def-axiom-of-pairing]] gives a set whose elements are
exactly $x$ and $y$, and [[def-axiom-of-extensionality]] shows there is only one
such set; it is written $\{x,y\}$. Thus $\{x,y\}$ is the set whose elements are
exactly $x$ and $y$, and $\{x\} := \{x,x\}$, the **singleton** of $x$, is the set
whose only element is $x$:

$$t \in \{x,y\} \leftrightarrow (t = x \vee t = y), \qquad t \in \{x\} \leftrightarrow t = x .$$

## Remarks

- **The pair is unordered.** $t = x \vee t = y$ and $t = y \vee t = x$ are the
  same condition, so $\{x,y\} = \{y,x\}$, and the notation records no order.
  [[lem-unordered-pair-equality]] says exactly how much information a pair does
  carry, and [[def-ordered-pair]] is the construction that recovers an order from
  unordered pairs alone.

- **A singleton is not its element.** $\{x\}$ has exactly one element, namely
  $x$, and $x$ and $\{x\}$ are different sets whenever they have different
  elements; $\{\varnothing\}$ has one element while $\varnothing$ has none, so
  the two are already distinct at the bottom of the hierarchy.

$\neg\exists z\,(z \in e)$, and any two such sets are equal. That set is written
$\varnothing$.

**Given:** the language of set theory, in which the domain of discourse is nonempty ([[def-language-of-set-theory]]).

[L1] For any parameters $\bar p$ and any set $x$, there is a set $y$ whose elements are exactly the elements $z$ of $x$ for which $\varphi(z,\bar p)$ holds ([[def-axiom-schema-of-separation]]).

[L2] If every $z$ satisfies $z \in x$ if and only if $z \in y$, then $x = y$ ([[def-axiom-of-extensionality]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The domain of discourse is nonempty, so fix a set $a$. [given, choose]

2.1 Apply Separation to $a$ with the formula $\varphi(z) := \neg(z = z)$: there is a set $e$ such that, for every $z$, $z \in e$ holds if and only if $z \in a$ and $\neg(z = z)$. [L1, step 1.1]

3.1 No $z$ satisfies $\neg(z = z)$, so no $z$ satisfies $z \in e$; hence $e$ is a set with no elements, which proves existence. [step 2.1]

4.1 If $e'$ is also a set with no elements, then $z \in e$ and $z \in e'$ both fail for every $z$, so $z \in e$ holds if and only if $z \in e'$, and therefore $e = e'$; existence and uniqueness together give the statement, and $\varnothing$ denotes this set. [L2, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Existence is derived, not assumed.** Several presentations take "there is a set with no elements" as an axiom of its own. Here it is a theorem, because the nonemptiness of the domain of discourse is already a validity of first-order logic and Separation converts any set whatever into this one.

## Definition

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. By
[[lem-ordered-pairs-lie-in-the-double-power-set]] every ordered pair $(a,b)$ with
$a \in A$ and $b \in B$ is an element of $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(A \cup B))$, so
[[def-axiom-schema-of-separation]] applied inside that set produces the
**Cartesian product**

$$A \times B := \{\, z \in \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(A \cup B)) : \exists a \in A\ \exists b \in B\ z = (a,b) \,\}.$$

Its elements are exactly the ordered pairs $(a,b)$ ([[def-ordered-pair]]) with
$a \in A$ and $b \in B$: no such pair is lost, because each such pair lies in
the ambient set being separated. Thus $z \in A \times B$ holds if and only if
$z = (a,b)$ for some $a \in A$ and some $b \in B$.

## Remarks

- **Why the ambient set is needed.** "The set of all ordered pairs with first
  coordinate in $A$ and second in $B$" is a class abbreviation, and no axiom
  turns a class abbreviation into a set on its own. The double power set is what
  supplies a set to separate inside, so the product costs
  [[def-axiom-of-power-set]] and [[def-axiom-of-union]] as well as Separation;
  [[rem-which-axiom-each-construction-uses]] keeps the account.

- **Products of nonempty sets.** Whether a product of *two* nonempty sets is
  nonempty is settled here, by exhibiting the pair
  ([[prop-cartesian-products-and-set-operations]]). The corresponding question
  for a product of an arbitrary indexed family of nonempty sets is not settled by
  the axioms on this page: it is one formulation of the Axiom of Choice, stated
  at [[def-axiom-of-choice]].

## Statement

For all sets $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$: $(a,b) = (c,d)$ if and only if $a = c$ and
$b = d$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** sets $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$.

[L1] $(a,b) := \{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$ ([[def-ordered-pair]]).

[L2] $\{x,y\}$ is the set whose elements are exactly $x$ and $y$, and $\{x\} := \{x,x\}$ ([[def-unordered-pair-and-singleton]]).

[L3] $\{a,b\} = \{c,d\} \ \leftrightarrow\ \bigl((a = c \wedge b = d) \vee (a = d \wedge b = c)\bigr)$ ([[lem-unordered-pair-equality]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Right to left: if $a = c$ and $b = d$ then $\{a\} = \{c\}$ and $\{a,b\} = \{c,d\}$, so $\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$ and $\{\{c\},\{c,d\}\}$ are the same set, that is $(a,b) = (c,d)$. [L1, L2]

1.2 Left to right, setting up: assume $\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\} = \{\{c\},\{c,d\}\}$. Applying the equality criterion for unordered pairs to these two sets, either $\{a\} = \{c\}$ and $\{a,b\} = \{c,d\}$, or $\{a\} = \{c,d\}$ and $\{a,b\} = \{c\}$. [L1, L3]

2.1 In the first alternative, $\{a\} = \{c\}$ reads $\{a,a\} = \{c,c\}$ and gives $a = c$. Then $\{a,b\} = \{c,d\}$ gives $a = c$ and $b = d$, or $a = d$ and $b = c$; in the second of these $b = c = a = d$, so $b = d$ holds as well. Either way $a = c$ and $b = d$. [assume-case first, step 1.2, L2, L3]

2.2 In the second alternative, $\{a,b\} = \{c\}$ reads $\{a,b\} = \{c,c\}$ and gives $a = c$ and $b = c$, while $\{a\} = \{c,d\}$ reads $\{a,a\} = \{c,d\}$ and gives $a = c$ and $a = d$. Hence $a = c$ and $b = c = a = d$. [assume-case second, step 1.2, L2, L3]

3.1 The two alternatives supplied by step 1.2 are exhaustive, so the left-to-right implication holds. [step 2.1, step 2.2, cases-exhaustive]

4.1 Both implications hold, which is the statement. [step 1.1, step 3.1] ∎

pipeline_run: null
---

## Definition

Let $x$ be a set. [[def-axiom-of-union]] gives a set whose elements are exactly
the sets $z$ belonging to some member of $x$, and [[def-axiom-of-extensionality]]
shows there is only one such set; it is written $\bigcup x$. Thus $\bigcup x$ is
the set whose elements are exactly the elements of the elements of $x$, and
$a \cup b := \bigcup\{a,b\}$ is the **binary union** of $a$ and $b$, formed from
the unordered pair of [[def-unordered-pair-and-singleton]]:

$$z \in \bigcup x \leftrightarrow \exists s\,(s \in x \wedge z \in s).$$

The membership criterion for the binary union, that $z \in a \cup b$ holds
exactly when $z \in a$ or $z \in b$, is proved at
[[lem-unions-and-intersections-of-small-families]] rather than assumed here.

## Remarks

- **One layer only.** $\bigcup x$ collects the elements of the elements of $x$,
  not the elements of $x$. For a set of sets of sets the operation therefore has
  to be applied twice, and that iteration is what makes
  $\bigcup\bigcup R$ the right ambient set for the domain and range of a
  relation.

- **Notation.** $\bigcup$ with a single set argument is the primitive operation
  supplied by the axiom; $\cup$ between two sets is the derived binary one. The
  indexed form $\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i$ is a further abbreviation, defined once
  indexed families are available.

## Statement

For all sets $a$ and $b$:

- (i) $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$;
- (ii) $\bigcup \{a\} = a$;
- (iii) $\bigcup \{a,b\} = a \cup b$, and $z \in a \cup b$ holds if and only if $z \in a$ or $z \in b$;
- (iv) $\bigcap \{a\} = a$;
- (v) $\bigcap \{a,b\} = a \cap b$, and $z \in a \cap b$ holds if and only if $z \in a$ and $z \in b$.

The equalities in (iii) and (v) are the definitions of $a \cup b$ and $a \cap b$
written out; what is proved about them here is the membership criterion beside
each.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** sets $a$ and $b$.

[L1] $\bigcup x$ is the set whose elements are exactly the elements of the elements of $x$, and $a \cup b := \bigcup\{a,b\}$ ([[def-union-of-a-set-and-binary-union]]).

[L2] For $x \neq \varnothing$, $\bigcap x$ is the set whose elements are exactly the sets belonging to every element of $x$, and $a \cap b := \bigcap\{a,b\}$ ([[def-intersection-of-a-set-and-binary-intersection]]).

[L3] $\{x,y\}$ is the set whose elements are exactly $x$ and $y$, and $\{x\} := \{x,x\}$ ([[def-unordered-pair-and-singleton]]).

[L4] There is exactly one set with no elements, written $\varnothing$ ([[thm-the-empty-set-exists-and-is-unique]]).

[L5] If every $z$ satisfies $z \in x$ if and only if $z \in y$, then $x = y$ ([[def-axiom-of-extensionality]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Claim (i): $z \in \bigcup \varnothing$ requires a member $s$ of $\varnothing$ with $z \in s$, and $\varnothing$ has no members, so $\bigcup \varnothing$ has no elements and is therefore $\varnothing$. [L1, L4]

1.2 Claim (ii): $z \in \bigcup \{a\}$ requires a member $s$ of $\{a\}$ with $z \in s$, and the only member of $\{a\}$ is $a$, so $z \in \bigcup\{a\}$ holds exactly when $z \in a$. [L1, L3]

1.3 Claim (iii): $a \cup b$ is $\bigcup\{a,b\}$ by definition, and $z \in \bigcup\{a,b\}$ requires a member $s$ of $\{a,b\}$ with $z \in s$; the members of $\{a,b\}$ are $a$ and $b$, so $z \in a \cup b$ holds exactly when $z \in a$ or $z \in b$. [L1, L3]

1.4 Claim (iv): $\{a\}$ is nonempty since $a$ is a member, and $z \in \bigcap\{a\}$ holds exactly when $z$ belongs to every member of $\{a\}$, that is, exactly when $z \in a$. [L2, L3]

1.5 Claim (v): $a \cap b$ is $\bigcap\{a,b\}$ by definition, $\{a,b\}$ is nonempty, and $z \in \bigcap\{a,b\}$ holds exactly when $z$ belongs to every member of $\{a,b\}$; the members are $a$ and $b$, so $z \in a \cap b$ holds exactly when $z \in a$ and $z \in b$. [L2, L3]

2.1 In each of the five claims the elements of the two sides have been shown to satisfy the same condition, so the sets are equal, which is the statement. [L5, step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, step 1.4, step 1.5] ∎

## Definition

The **Axiom of Extensionality** is the sentence

$$\forall x\,\forall y\,\bigl(\forall z\,(z \in x \leftrightarrow z \in y) \to x = y\bigr)$$

of the language of set theory ([[def-language-of-set-theory]]): if every $z$
satisfies $z \in x$ if and only if $z \in y$, then $x = y$.

A set is therefore determined by its members and by nothing else. Order,
repetition and any description used to present a set are invisible to identity.

## Remarks

- **The converse is logic, not an axiom.** If $x = y$ then $z \in x$ and
  $z \in y$ are the same statement for every $z$, by the substitution rule for
  equality. So Extensionality upgrades to the biconditional
  $x = y \leftrightarrow \forall z\,(z \in x \leftrightarrow z \in y)$, and only
  the left-to-right direction of that biconditional is assumed.

- **What it is used for below.** Every construction on this page produces a set
  by an axiom that specifies its members, and every such axiom is stated with
  $\leftrightarrow$. Extensionality is what turns "a set with these members" into
  "*the* set with these members", so it is the licence for each definite article
  and each piece of notation introduced here.
