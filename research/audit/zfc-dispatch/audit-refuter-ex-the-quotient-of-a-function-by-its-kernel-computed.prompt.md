# Proof-refuter brief — run `zfc`, step 6

You are a **read-only adversarial proof-refuter** for a public mathematics
library. You have no filesystem and no web access: **everything you may rely on
is in the "This dispatch" section below.** Do not assume any fact about an item
that is not reproduced there.

You are reading **draft** content at the very bottom of the library — the ZFC
axioms and the set-theoretic treatment of relations and functions. Everything
above rests on it, so a wrong step here is inherited by thousands of results.
This material is elementary, which makes it easy to wave through. Do not.

## Your standard

Read the target item's **Statement/Definition/Example**, its **Facts &
Assumptions** block, and **every numbered step of its Proof / Verification /
Refutation** as someone trying to break it. For each step ask:

1. Does the cited material **mathematically license exactly what the step
   claims** — no more? The dominant defect class in this corpus is a fact
   restated more strongly than its source supports.
2. Is each `[F#]`/`[L#]` fact a **faithful** rendering of the dependency it
   names? Compare it against the dependency's full text, which is supplied.
   Check domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, direction, and conclusion. An invented
   converse is fatal.
3. Does the **title or Statement assert more than the proof delivers**? A judge
   who reads only the Statement cannot see a false title, so you must.
4. **Boundary cases.** The empty set, the empty family, the empty relation,
   functions out of and into $\varnothing$, $\mathcal{P}(\varnothing)$,
   $A \times \varnothing$, $\bigcap\varnothing$, zero- and one-element index
   sets, and **both directions of every "if and only if"**. This is where this
   material ships falsehoods.
5. **Circularity.** Does a proof use, directly or through a cited fact, the very
   thing it is establishing — or a result that is itself proved from it? Two such
   defects were already found on these pages.

## What counts, and what does not

- **Report** a concrete false claim, an unlicensed inference, a missing
  hypothesis, an inaccurate or overstated citation, a boundary case the proof
  silently assumes away, or a circularity. Name the exact step or fact and say
  **why**, with the counterexample or the missing hypothesis made explicit.
- **Do not report** a gap a competent reader closes in 30 seconds, a stylistic
  preference, a suggestion to add exposition, or a complaint that a step is
  "not fully rigorous" without naming what is actually wrong.
- Before alleging a cited dependency is too weak, **read the dependency text
  supplied below**. If it does support the step, say so.

You return **evidence, never edits**. You do not have write access and must not
propose file changes. An adjudicator reads your findings against the real files
and decides.

## Output format

Reply with exactly this structure, and nothing else:

```
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

Then, if `DEFECTS`, one block per finding:

```
FINDING 1
  location: [the exact step number, fact label, title, or Statement]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [what the item asserts there]
  defect:   [precisely what is wrong, with the counterexample or missing hypothesis]
```

Then always, last:

```
BOUNDARY: [one line per boundary case you checked and its disposition]
CHECKED:  [one line confirming you read every numbered step and every cited fact]
```

Be terse. No preamble, no summary of the mathematics, no praise.

## Example

Write $u := \varnothing$, $v := \{\varnothing\}$,
$w := \{\varnothing,\{\varnothing\}\}$ and $x := \{\{\varnothing\}\}$; these four
are pairwise distinct. Put $A := \{u,v\} \cup \{w,x\}$ and $B := \{u,v\}$, and
let

$$f := \{(u,u),(v,u)\} \cup \{(w,v),(x,v)\},$$

so $f : A \to B$ takes the value $u$ twice and the value $v$ twice. Then

$$\ker f = \{(u,u),(u,v)\} \cup \{(v,u),(v,v)\} \cup \{(w,w),(w,x)\} \cup \{(x,w),(x,x)\},$$

$$A/{\ker f} = \{\{u,v\},\{w,x\}\}, \qquad f[A] = B,$$

and the canonical factorisation $f = \iota \circ \bar f \circ \pi$ has
$\pi(u) = \pi(v) = \{u,v\}$, $\pi(w) = \pi(x) = \{w,x\}$,
$\bar f(\{u,v\}) = u$, $\bar f(\{w,x\}) = v$, and $\iota = \Delta_{B}$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $u,v,w,x$, $A$, $B$ and $f$ as displayed.

[L1] $\ker f$ is a set, is a relation on $A$, and is an equivalence relation on $A$ ([[lem-the-kernel-of-a-function-is-an-equivalence-relation]]).

[L2] there is a function $\bar f : A/{\sim} \to f[A]$ with $\bar f([a]) = f(a)$ for every $a \in A$, and it is a bijection ([[thm-canonical-decomposition-of-a-function]]).

[L3] A **function** is a relation $f$ such that $(a,b) \in f$ and $(a,c) \in f$ imply $b = c$ ([[def-function]]).

[L4] $[a] \;:=\; \{\, b \in A \;:\; a \sim b \,\} \;\subseteq\; A$ ([[def-equivalence-relation]]).

[L5] $A/{\sim} \;:=\; \{\, [a] \;:\; a \in A \,\}$ ([[def-equivalence-relation]]).

[L6] $b \in R[A]$ holds if and only if $(a,b) \in R$ for some $a \in A$ ([[def-image-and-preimage-under-a-relation]]).

[L7] $\{x,y\}$ is the set whose elements are exactly $x$ and $y$, and $\{x\} := \{x,x\}$ ([[def-unordered-pair-and-singleton]]).

[L8] There is exactly one set with no elements, written $\varnothing$ ([[thm-the-empty-set-exists-and-is-unique]]).

[L9] $f$ is **surjective** (onto) if for every $b \in B$ there is some $x \in A$ with $f(x) = b$ ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L10] $z \in a \cup b$ holds if and only if $z \in a$ or $z \in b$ ([[lem-unions-and-intersections-of-small-families]]).

[L11] $a \cup b := \bigcup\{a,b\}$ ([[def-union-of-a-set-and-binary-union]]).

[L12] $(a,b) = (c,d)$ if and only if $a = c$ and $b = d$ ([[thm-the-characterising-property-of-ordered-pairs]]).

[L13] $\operatorname{dom} R := \{\, a : \exists b\ (a,b) \in R \,\}, \qquad \operatorname{ran} R := \{\, b : \exists a\ (a,b) \in R \,\}$ ([[def-relation-domain-range-and-field]]).

## Verification

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The four sets are pairwise distinct: $u$ has no element; $v$ and $x$ each have exactly one, namely $u$ and $v$ respectively, which differ; and $w$ has both $u$ and $v$, so it differs from all three. Hence $A$ has exactly four elements and $B$ exactly two. [L7, L8, L10, L11]

2.1 $f$ is a function $A \to B$: its four pairs have distinct first coordinates, so it is single valued; its domain is $A$ and its range is $B$. It is surjective, since $u = f(u)$ and $v = f(w)$, so $f[A] = B$. [L3, L6, L9, L12, L13, step 1.1]

3.1 $\ker f$ is as displayed: a pair $(a,a')$ of elements of $A$ lies in it exactly when $f(a) = f(a')$, and $f$ takes the value $u$ exactly at $u$ and $v$, and the value $v$ exactly at $w$ and $x$; so the pairs are those with both coordinates in $\{u,v\}$ or both in $\{w,x\}$. By the general lemma it is an equivalence relation on $A$. [L1, L12, step 1.1, step 2.1]

4.1 The classes are $[u] = [v] = \{u,v\}$ and $[w] = [x] = \{w,x\}$, so $A/{\ker f}$ has exactly the two elements $\{u,v\}$ and $\{w,x\}$, and the quotient map sends $u$ and $v$ to the first and $w$ and $x$ to the second. [L4, L5, L7, step 3.1]

5.1 The canonical factorisation is as displayed: $\bar f$ sends $\{u,v\} = [u]$ to $f(u) = u$ and $\{w,x\} = [w]$ to $f(w) = v$, and it is a bijection onto $f[A] = B$; the inclusion $\iota$ is the identity on $B$ because $f[A] = B$; and composing gives back $f$.

## Statement

Let $f : A \to B$ be a function. Then

$$\ker f \;:=\; \{\,(a,a') \in A \times A : f(a) = f(a')\,\}$$

is a set, is a relation on $A$, and is an equivalence relation on $A$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** a function $f : A \to B$.

[L1] We write $f : A \to B$, and say $f$ is a **function from $A$ to $B$**, when $f$ is a function with $\operatorname{dom} f = A$ and $\operatorname{ran} f \subseteq B$ ([[def-function]]).

[L2] For any parameters $\bar p$ and any set $x$, there is a set $y$ whose elements are exactly the elements $z$ of $x$ for which $\varphi(z,\bar p)$ holds ([[def-axiom-schema-of-separation]]).

[L3] $z \in A \times B$ holds if and only if $z = (a,b)$ for some $a \in A$ and some $b \in B$ ([[def-cartesian-product]]).

[L4] $R$ is a **relation on $A$** when $R \subseteq A \times A$ ([[def-relation-domain-range-and-field]]).

[L5] **reflexive**: $a \sim a$ for every $a \in A$ ([[def-equivalence-relation]]).

[L6] **symmetric**: $a \sim b$ implies $b \sim a$, for all $a, b \in A$ ([[def-equivalence-relation]]).

[L7] **transitive**: $a \sim b$ and $b \sim c$ imply $a \sim c$, for all $a, b, c \in A$ ([[def-equivalence-relation]]).

[L8] $R$ is **transitive** when $(a,b) \in R$ and $(b,c) \in R$ imply $(a,c) \in R$, for all $a, b, c \in A$ ([[def-properties-of-a-relation-on-a-set]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $\ker f$ is a set and a relation on $A$: it is obtained by separating inside $A \times A$ with the formula $\exists a\,\exists a'\,(z = (a,a') \wedge f(a) = f(a'))$ and the parameters $A$ and $f$, so it is a subset of $A \times A$ and each of its elements is an ordered pair. [L1, L2, L3, L4]

2.1 It is reflexive on $A$: for $a \in A$ the value $f(a)$ is a single set, so $f(a) = f(a)$ and $(a,a) \in \ker f$. [L1, L5, step 1.1]

2.2 It is symmetric: if $(a,a') \in \ker f$ then $f(a) = f(a')$, hence $f(a') = f(a)$ and $(a',a) \in \ker f$. [L6, step 1.1]

2.3 It is transitive: if $(a,a') \in \ker f$ and $(a',a'') \in \ker f$ then $f(a) = f(a')$ and $f(a') = f(a'')$, hence $f(a) = f(a'')$ and $(a,a'') \in \ker f$. [L7, L8, step 1.1]

3.1 $\ker f$ is a relation on $A$ that is reflexive on $A$, symmetric and transitive, which is what it means to be an equivalence relation on $A$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3] ∎

## Statement

Let $f : A \to B$, write $\sim$ for $\ker f$ and let
$\pi : A \to A/{\sim}$ be the quotient map. Put
$\iota := \Delta_{f[A]}$, the identity relation on $f[A]$. Then

- (i) $\pi$ is surjective;
- (ii) there is a function $\bar f : A/{\sim} \to f[A]$ with $\bar f([a]) = f(a)$ for every $a \in A$, and it is a bijection;
- (iii) $\iota$ is an injective function $f[A] \to B$ with $\iota(y) = y$;
- (iv) $\iota \circ \bar f \circ \pi = f$;
- (v) $\bar f$ is the only function $A/{\sim} \to f[A]$ satisfying (iv).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** a function $f : A \to B$, with $\sim$ denoting $\ker f$.

[L1] $\ker f$ is a set, is a relation on $A$, and is an equivalence relation on $A$ ([[lem-the-kernel-of-a-function-is-an-equivalence-relation]]).

[L2] $\pi$ is a surjective function $A \to A/{\sim}$ with $\pi(a) = [a]$ ([[thm-universal-property-of-the-quotient]]).

[L3] there is a function $g : A/{\sim} \to B$ with $g \circ \pi = f$ if and only if $f(a) = f(a')$ whenever $a \sim a'$ ([[thm-universal-property-of-the-quotient]]).

[L4] when such a $g$ exists it is unique, and it satisfies $g([a]) = f(a)$ for every $a \in A$ ([[thm-universal-property-of-the-quotient]]).

[L5] $A/{\sim} \;:=\; \{\, [a] \;:\; a \in A \,\}$ ([[def-equivalence-relation]]).

[L6] $f$ is **injective** (one-to-one) if $f(x) = f(y)$ implies $x = y$, for all $x, y \in A$ ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L7] $f$ is **surjective** (onto) if for every $b \in B$ there is some $x \in A$ with $f(x) = b$ ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L8] We write $f : A \to B$, and say $f$ is a **function from $A$ to $B$**, when $f$ is a function with $\operatorname{dom} f = A$ and $\operatorname{ran} f \subseteq B$ ([[def-function]]).

[L9] $b \in R[A]$ holds if and only if $(a,b) \in R$ for some $a \in A$ ([[def-image-and-preimage-under-a-relation]]).

[L10] $\Delta_A$ is a function with $\operatorname{dom} \Delta_A = A$ and $\Delta_A(a) = a$ for every $a \in A$ ([[lem-the-composite-of-two-functions-is-a-function]]).

[L11] $g \circ f$ is a function, $\operatorname{dom}(g \circ f) = f^{-1}[\operatorname{dom} g]$, and $(g \circ f)(x) = g(f(x))$ for every $x$ in that domain ([[lem-the-composite-of-two-functions-is-a-function]]).

[L12] $f = g$ if and only if $\operatorname{dom} f = \operatorname{dom} g$ and $f(x) = g(x)$ for every $x \in \operatorname{dom} f$ ([[lem-two-functions-are-equal-exactly-when-they-agree-at-every-point]]).

[L13] $\operatorname{ran} R := \{\, b : \exists a\ (a,b) \in R \,\}$ ([[def-relation-domain-range-and-field]]).

[L14] $(a,b) \in \Delta_A$ holds if and only if $a = b$ and $a \in A$ ([[def-the-identity-and-membership-relations-on-a-set]]).

[L15] $T \circ (S \circ R) = (T \circ S) \circ R$ ([[prop-composition-of-relations-is-associative]]).

[L16] $x \subseteq y$ means that every element of $x$ is an element of $y$ ([[def-subset-and-proper-subset]]).

[L17] $a \sim b$ if and only if $[a] = [b]$ ([[lem-equivalence-classes-partition]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $A$ and $a \sim a'$ says exactly $f(a) = f(a')$; so the hypothesis of the universal property is satisfied, and clause (i) is the surjectivity already recorded for the quotient map. [L1, L2, L3]

1.2 Claim (iii): $\iota = \Delta_{f[A]}$ is a function with domain $f[A]$ and $\iota(y) = y$; its range is $f[A]$, which is contained in $B$ because every element of $f[A]$ is a value of $f$ and $\operatorname{ran} f \subseteq B$. It is injective, since $\iota(y) = \iota(y')$ reads $y = y'$. [L6, L8, L9, L10, L13, L14, L16]

2.1 Claim (ii): the universal property gives a function $g : A/{\sim} \to B$ with $g \circ \pi = f$ and $g([a]) = f(a)$ for every $a \in A$. Every value of $g$ is therefore a value of $f$, so $\operatorname{ran} g \subseteq f[A]$, and the same set $g$ is a function $A/{\sim} \to f[A]$; call it $\bar f$. It is onto $f[A]$, because each element of $f[A]$ is $f(a) = \bar f([a])$ for some $a \in A$; and it is injective, because $\bar f([a]) = \bar f([a'])$ gives $f(a) = f(a')$, that is $a \sim a'$, and therefore $[a] = [a']$. Hence $\bar f$ is a bijection. [L3, L4, L5, L6, L7, L8, L9, L13, L17, step 1.1]

3.1 Claim (iv): $\iota \circ \bar f \circ \pi$ is unambiguous by associativity, it is a function with domain $A$, and for $a \in A$ its value is $\iota(\bar f(\pi(a))) = \iota(f(a)) = f(a)$; so it equals $f$. [L11, L12, L15, step 1.2, step 2.1]

3.2 Claim (v): if $h : A/{\sim} \to f[A]$ also satisfies $\iota \circ h \circ \pi = f$, then for $C \in A/{\sim}$ choose $a$ with $C = [a]$ and compute $h(C) = \iota(h(\pi(a))) = f(a) = \bar f(C)$; both have domain $A/{\sim}$, so $h = \bar f$. [L5, L10, L11, L12, step 1.2, step 2.1]

4.1 Claims (i) to (v) are established, which is the statement. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.1, step 3.1, step 3.2] ∎

## Definition

A **function** is a relation $f$ such that $(a,b) \in f$ and $(a,c) \in f$ imply
$b = c$; "relation" is as in [[def-relation-domain-range-and-field]].

For $a \in \operatorname{dom} f$ there is such a $b$, and by the condition just
stated there is only one; $f(a)$ denotes that unique $b$, so that
$(a,b) \in f$ holds if and only if $a \in \operatorname{dom} f$ and $b = f(a)$
([[thm-the-characterising-property-of-ordered-pairs]]).

We write $f : A \to B$, and say $f$ is a **function from $A$ to $B$**, when $f$
is a function with $\operatorname{dom} f = A$ and
$\operatorname{ran} f \subseteq B$ ([[def-subset-and-proper-subset]]); $A$ is the
**domain** of $f$ and $B$ is a **codomain** for $f$. Equivalently
$f \subseteq A \times B$ with $\operatorname{dom} f = A$
([[def-cartesian-product]], [[def-ordered-pair]]).

## Remarks

- **The codomain belongs to the declaration, not to the set.** A function is a
  set of ordered pairs, and that set determines its domain and its range but not
  a codomain: the same $f$ satisfies $f : A \to B$ for every $B$ containing
  $\operatorname{ran} f$. So being onto is a property of the declaration
  $f : A \to B$ rather than of $f$, while being one-to-one is a property of $f$
  alone. This convention is what makes $\varnothing$ a function
  $\varnothing \to B$ for every $B$ at once.

- **Total on its domain by construction.** There is no partial function here: if
  $a \notin \operatorname{dom} f$ then $f(a)$ is not defined, and a function
  $f : A \to B$ has $\operatorname{dom} f$ equal to $A$ exactly, not merely
  included in it.

## Definition

A **binary relation** on a set $A$ is a subset $R \subseteq A \times A$; we write
$a \sim b$ for $(a,b) \in R$ and read it "$a$ is related to $b$".

A binary relation $\sim$ on $A$ is an **equivalence relation** when it is

- **reflexive**: $a \sim a$ for every $a \in A$;
- **symmetric**: $a \sim b$ implies $b \sim a$, for all $a, b \in A$;
- **transitive**: $a \sim b$ and $b \sim c$ imply $a \sim c$, for all
  $a, b, c \in A$.

Let $\sim$ be an equivalence relation on $A$. For $a \in A$, the **equivalence
class** of $a$ is the subset

$$[a] \;:=\; \{\, b \in A \;:\; a \sim b \,\} \;\subseteq\; A,$$

and any $b$ with $[b] = C$ is called a **representative** of the class $C$. The
**quotient set** is the set of all classes,

$$A/{\sim} \;:=\; \{\, [a] \;:\; a \in A \,\},$$

a subset of the power set of $A$. The map $\pi : A \to A/{\sim}$ with
$\pi(a) = [a]$ is the **quotient map**; it is surjective by construction.

## Remarks

- **What the classes look like** is the content of
  [[lem-equivalence-classes-partition]]: they are nonempty, they cover $A$, and
  any two of them are either equal or disjoint. That lemma also runs the
  converse, so "equivalence relation on $A$" and "partition of $A$" are two names
  for the same data.

- **Well-definedness.** A rule that assigns a value to $[a]$ by a formula in the
  representative $a$ defines a function on $A/{\sim}$ only if the value is the
  same for every representative, that is, only if $a \sim a'$ implies that the
  formula returns the same value at $a$ and at $a'$. This is the obligation the
  library has already discharged case by case for the constructions of
  $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ ([[lem-int-add-well-defined]],
  [[lem-int-mul-well-defined]], [[lem-rat-ops-well-defined]]); it is stated here
  once, in general.

- **Why this item exists so late.** The library has used specific equivalence
  relations from the start: [[lem-int-equivalence]] proves that
  $(a,b) \sim (c,d) \iff a + d = b + c$ is one, and [[lem-rat-equivalence]] does
  the same for the relation defining $\mathbb{Q}$. Each of those items proves the
  three properties for one concrete relation and defines no general notion. The
  general notion is introduced here because the algebra track needs it uniformly:
  cosets, quotient groups, congruence classes and quotient rings are all
  instances, and each would otherwise re-prove the same three lines.

## Definition

Let $R$ be a relation ([[def-relation-domain-range-and-field]]) and let $A$ and
$B$ be sets. The **image of $A$ under $R$** and the **preimage of $B$ under $R$**
are

$$R[A] := \{\, b \in \operatorname{ran} R : \exists a\ (a \in A \wedge (a,b) \in R) \,\}, \qquad R^{-1}[B] := \{\, a \in \operatorname{dom} R : \exists b\ (b \in B \wedge (a,b) \in R) \,\},$$

sets by [[def-axiom-schema-of-separation]] applied inside $\operatorname{ran} R$
and $\operatorname{dom} R$ respectively. Thus $b \in R[A]$ holds if and only if
$(a,b) \in R$ for some $a \in A$, and $a \in R^{-1}[B]$ holds if and only if
$(a,b) \in R$ for some $b \in B$ ([[def-ordered-pair]]).

The notation is consistent: applying the first clause to the inverse relation
$R^{-1}$ of [[def-inverse-relation-composition-and-restriction]] gives
$R^{-1}[B] = \{\, a \in \operatorname{ran}(R^{-1}) : \exists b\ (b \in B \wedge (b,a) \in R^{-1}) \,\}$,
which has exactly the elements just described, since $(b,a) \in R^{-1}$ says
$(a,b) \in R$ and $\operatorname{ran}(R^{-1}) = \operatorname{dom} R$.

## Remarks

- **The bracket is not an application.** $R[A]$ is the set of things related to
  something in $A$; it is written with square brackets precisely so that it is
  never confused with a value $R(a)$, which for a general relation does not
  exist. Even for a function, $f[S]$ and $f(S)$ mean different things, and only
  the bracket form is used here.

- **Image and range.** Taking $A := \operatorname{dom} R$ gives
  $R[\operatorname{dom} R] = \operatorname{ran} R$, and taking $A := \varnothing$
  gives $R[\varnothing] = \varnothing$, since no $a$ lies in $\varnothing$.

## Definition

Let $x$ and $y$ be sets. [[def-axiom-of-pairing]] gives a set whose elements are
exactly $x$ and $y$, and [[def-axiom-of-extensionality]] shows there is only one
such set; it is written $\{x,y\}$. Thus $\{x,y\}$ is the set whose elements are
exactly $x$ and $y$, and $\{x\} := \{x,x\}$, the **singleton** of $x$, is the set
whose only element is $x$:

$$t \in \{x,y\} \leftrightarrow (t = x \vee t = y), \qquad t \in \{x\} \leftrightarrow t = x .$$

## Remarks

- **The pair is unordered.** $t = x \vee t = y$ and $t = y \vee t = x$ are the
  same condition, so $\{x,y\} = \{y,x\}$, and the notation records no order.
  [[lem-unordered-pair-equality]] says exactly how much information a pair does
  carry, and [[def-ordered-pair]] is the construction that recovers an order from
  unordered pairs alone.

- **A singleton is not its element.** $\{x\}$ has exactly one element, namely
  $x$, and $x$ and $\{x\}$ are different sets whenever they have different
  elements; $\{\varnothing\}$ has one element while $\varnothing$ has none, so
  the two are already distinct at the bottom of the hierarchy.

## Statement

There is exactly one set with no elements: there is a set $e$ such that
$\neg\exists z\,(z \in e)$, and any two such sets are equal. That set is written
$\varnothing$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** the language of set theory, in which the domain of discourse is nonempty ([[def-language-of-set-theory]]).

[L1] For any parameters $\bar p$ and any set $x$, there is a set $y$ whose elements are exactly the elements $z$ of $x$ for which $\varphi(z,\bar p)$ holds ([[def-axiom-schema-of-separation]]).

[L2] If every $z$ satisfies $z \in x$ if and only if $z \in y$, then $x = y$ ([[def-axiom-of-extensionality]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The domain of discourse is nonempty, so fix a set $a$. [given, choose]

2.1 Apply Separation to $a$ with the formula $\varphi(z) := \neg(z = z)$: there is a set $e$ such that, for every $z$, $z \in e$ holds if and only if $z \in a$ and $\neg(z = z)$. [L1, step 1.1]

3.1 No $z$ satisfies $\neg(z = z)$, so no $z$ satisfies $z \in e$; hence $e$ is a set with no elements, which proves existence. [step 2.1]

4.1 If $e'$ is also a set with no elements, then $z \in e$ and $z \in e'$ both fail for every $z$, so $z \in e$ holds if and only if $z \in e'$, and therefore $e = e'$; existence and uniqueness together give the statement, and $\varnothing$ denotes this set. [L2, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Existence is derived, not assumed.** Several presentations take "there is a set with no elements" as an axiom of its own. Here it is a theorem, because the nonemptiness of the domain of discourse is already a validity of first-order logic and Separation converts any set whatever into this one.

## Definition

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets and let $f : A \to B$ be a function.

- $f$ is **injective** (one-to-one) if $f(x) = f(y)$ implies $x = y$, for all
  $x, y \in A$.
- $f$ is **surjective** (onto) if for every $b \in B$ there is some $x \in A$
  with $f(x) = b$; equivalently, the image $f[A] := \{ f(x) : x \in A \}$ equals
  $B$.
- $f$ is **bijective** if it is both injective and surjective.

For $S \subseteq A$ we write $f[S] = \{ f(x) : x \in S \}$ for the image of $S$,
and for $T \subseteq B$ we write $f^{-1}[T] = \{ x \in A : f(x) \in T \}$ for the
preimage of $T$.

## Remarks

- **Composition.** If $f : A \to B$ and $g : B \to C$ are both injective then so
  is $g \circ f$, since $g(f(x)) = g(f(y))$ forces $f(x) = f(y)$ and then
  $x = y$; if both are surjective then so is $g \circ f$, since any $c \in C$ is
  $g(b)$ for some $b \in B$ and that $b$ is $f(a)$ for some $a \in A$. Hence a
  composition of bijections is a bijection. These one-line verifications are used
  silently throughout the library.

- **Inverses.** $f : A \to B$ is bijective exactly when there is a function
  $f^{-1} : B \to A$ with $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ for all $x \in A$ and
  $f(f^{-1}(b)) = b$ for all $b \in B$; that two-sided inverse is unique, and it
  is itself a bijection. Injectivity alone gives a bijection from $A$ onto the
  image $f[A]$, and hence an inverse defined on $f[A]$ only. No choice principle
  is involved: the value $f^{-1}(b)$ is the *unique* $x$ with $f(x) = b$, so it
  is determined rather than selected.

- **What this item does and does not do.** Functions, ordered pairs, Cartesian
  products, images and preimages are ambient ZFC vocabulary in this library, on
  the same footing as "subset" and "union": a function $A \to B$ is a set of
  ordered pairs, single valued and total on $A$. This item only fixes the three
  adjectives and the notation used for them. Nothing here is proved, and nothing
  here is assumed beyond the set-theoretic background already in use.

## Statement

For all sets $a$ and $b$:

- (i) $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$;
- (ii) $\bigcup \{a\} = a$;
- (iii) $\bigcup \{a,b\} = a \cup b$, and $z \in a \cup b$ holds if and only if $z \in a$ or $z \in b$;
- (iv) $\bigcap \{a\} = a$;
- (v) $\bigcap \{a,b\} = a \cap b$, and $z \in a \cap b$ holds if and only if $z \in a$ and $z \in b$.

The equalities in (iii) and (v) are the definitions of $a \cup b$ and $a \cap b$
written out; what is proved about them here is the membership criterion beside
each.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** sets $a$ and $b$.

[L1] $\bigcup x$ is the set whose elements are exactly the elements of the elements of $x$, and $a \cup b := \bigcup\{a,b\}$ ([[def-union-of-a-set-and-binary-union]]).

[L2] For $x \neq \varnothing$, $\bigcap x$ is the set whose elements are exactly the sets belonging to every element of $x$, and $a \cap b := \bigcap\{a,b\}$ ([[def-intersection-of-a-set-and-binary-intersection]]).

[L3] $\{x,y\}$ is the set whose elements are exactly $x$ and $y$, and $\{x\} := \{x,x\}$ ([[def-unordered-pair-and-singleton]]).

[L4] There is exactly one set with no elements, written $\varnothing$ ([[thm-the-empty-set-exists-and-is-unique]]).

[L5] If every $z$ satisfies $z \in x$ if and only if $z \in y$, then $x = y$ ([[def-axiom-of-extensionality]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Claim (i): $z \in \bigcup \varnothing$ requires a member $s$ of $\varnothing$ with $z \in s$, and $\varnothing$ has no members, so $\bigcup \varnothing$ has no elements and is therefore $\varnothing$. [L1, L4]

1.2 Claim (ii): $z \in \bigcup \{a\}$ requires a member $s$ of $\{a\}$ with $z \in s$, and the only member of $\{a\}$ is $a$, so $z \in \bigcup\{a\}$ holds exactly when $z \in a$. [L1, L3]

1.3 Claim (iii): $a \cup b$ is $\bigcup\{a,b\}$ by definition, and $z \in \bigcup\{a,b\}$ requires a member $s$ of $\{a,b\}$ with $z \in s$; the members of $\{a,b\}$ are $a$ and $b$, so $z \in a \cup b$ holds exactly when $z \in a$ or $z \in b$. [L1, L3]

1.4 Claim (iv): $\{a\}$ is nonempty since $a$ is a member, and $z \in \bigcap\{a\}$ holds exactly when $z$ belongs to every member of $\{a\}$, that is, exactly when $z \in a$. [L2, L3]

1.5 Claim (v): $a \cap b$ is $\bigcap\{a,b\}$ by definition, $\{a,b\}$ is nonempty, and $z \in \bigcap\{a,b\}$ holds exactly when $z$ belongs to every member of $\{a,b\}$; the members are $a$ and $b$, so $z \in a \cap b$ holds exactly when $z \in a$ and $z \in b$. [L2, L3]

2.1 In each of the five claims the elements of the two sides have been shown to satisfy the same condition, so the sets are equal, which is the statement. [L5, step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, step 1.4, step 1.5] ∎

pipeline_run: null
---

## Definition

Let $x$ be a set. [[def-axiom-of-union]] gives a set whose elements are exactly
the sets $z$ belonging to some member of $x$, and [[def-axiom-of-extensionality]]
shows there is only one such set; it is written $\bigcup x$. Thus $\bigcup x$ is
the set whose elements are exactly the elements of the elements of $x$, and
$a \cup b := \bigcup\{a,b\}$ is the **binary union** of $a$ and $b$, formed from
the unordered pair of [[def-unordered-pair-and-singleton]]:

$$z \in \bigcup x \leftrightarrow \exists s\,(s \in x \wedge z \in s).$$

The membership criterion for the binary union, that $z \in a \cup b$ holds
exactly when $z \in a$ or $z \in b$, is proved at
[[lem-unions-and-intersections-of-small-families]] rather than assumed here.

## Remarks

- **One layer only.** $\bigcup x$ collects the elements of the elements of $x$,
  not the elements of $x$. For a set of sets of sets the operation therefore has
  to be applied twice, and that iteration is what makes
  $\bigcup\bigcup R$ the right ambient set for the domain and range of a
  relation.

- **Notation.** $\bigcup$ with a single set argument is the primitive operation
  supplied by the axiom; $\cup$ between two sets is the derived binary one. The
  indexed form $\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i$ is a further abbreviation, defined once
  indexed families are available.

For all sets $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$: $(a,b) = (c,d)$ if and only if $a = c$ and
$b = d$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** sets $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$.

[L1] $(a,b) := \{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$ ([[def-ordered-pair]]).

[L2] $\{x,y\}$ is the set whose elements are exactly $x$ and $y$, and $\{x\} := \{x,x\}$ ([[def-unordered-pair-and-singleton]]).

[L3] $\{a,b\} = \{c,d\} \ \leftrightarrow\ \bigl((a = c \wedge b = d) \vee (a = d \wedge b = c)\bigr)$ ([[lem-unordered-pair-equality]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Right to left: if $a = c$ and $b = d$ then $\{a\} = \{c\}$ and $\{a,b\} = \{c,d\}$, so $\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$ and $\{\{c\},\{c,d\}\}$ are the same set, that is $(a,b) = (c,d)$. [L1, L2]

1.2 Left to right, setting up: assume $\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\} = \{\{c\},\{c,d\}\}$. Applying the equality criterion for unordered pairs to these two sets, either $\{a\} = \{c\}$ and $\{a,b\} = \{c,d\}$, or $\{a\} = \{c,d\}$ and $\{a,b\} = \{c\}$. [L1, L3]

2.1 In the first alternative, $\{a\} = \{c\}$ reads $\{a,a\} = \{c,c\}$ and gives $a = c$. Then $\{a,b\} = \{c,d\}$ gives $a = c$ and $b = d$, or $a = d$ and $b = c$; in the second of these $b = c = a = d$, so $b = d$ holds as well. Either way $a = c$ and $b = d$. [assume-case first, step 1.2, L2, L3]

2.2 In the second alternative, $\{a,b\} = \{c\}$ reads $\{a,b\} = \{c,c\}$ and gives $a = c$ and $b = c$, while $\{a\} = \{c,d\}$ reads $\{a,a\} = \{c,d\}$ and gives $a = c$ and $a = d$. Hence $a = c$ and $b = c = a = d$. [assume-case second, step 1.2, L2, L3]

3.1 The two alternatives supplied by step 1.2 are exhaustive, so the left-to-right implication holds. [step 2.1, step 2.2, cases-exhaustive]

4.1 Both implications hold, which is the statement. [step 1.1, step 3.1] ∎

## Definition

A **relation** is a set $R$ every element of which is an ordered pair
([[def-ordered-pair]]). We write $a\,R\,b$ for $(a,b) \in R$.

By [[lem-the-domain-and-range-of-a-relation-are-sets]] the following two classes
are sets, so the notation is legitimate:

$$\operatorname{dom} R := \{\, a : \exists b\ (a,b) \in R \,\}, \qquad \operatorname{ran} R := \{\, b : \exists a\ (a,b) \in R \,\},$$

the **domain** and the **range** of $R$. The **field** of $R$ is
$\operatorname{fld} R := \operatorname{dom} R \cup \operatorname{ran} R$
([[def-union-of-a-set-and-binary-union]]).

$R$ is a **relation from $A$ to $B$** when $R \subseteq A \times B$
([[def-cartesian-product]], [[def-subset-and-proper-subset]]), and a **relation
on $A$** when $R \subseteq A \times A$.

## Remarks

- **Domain and range are intrinsic; the sets $A$ and $B$ are not.** A relation
  determines its own domain and range, but it is a relation from $A$ to $B$ for
  many different $A$ and $B$: any $A$ containing $\operatorname{dom} R$ and any
  $B$ containing $\operatorname{ran} R$ will do. That is the content of
  [[lem-a-relation-is-included-in-the-product-of-its-domain-and-range]], and it
  is the same distinction that makes a codomain part of the declaration
  $f : A \to B$ rather than of the set $f$ in [[def-function]].

- **The empty set is a relation.** It has no elements, so the requirement that
  every element be an ordered pair holds vacuously, and
  $\operatorname{dom} \varnothing = \operatorname{ran} \varnothing = \varnothing$.
  It is a relation on every set.
