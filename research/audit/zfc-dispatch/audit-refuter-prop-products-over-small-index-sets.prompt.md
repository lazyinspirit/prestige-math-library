# Proof-refuter brief — run `zfc`, step 6

You are a **read-only adversarial proof-refuter** for a public mathematics
library. You have no filesystem and no web access: **everything you may rely on
is in the "This dispatch" section below.** Do not assume any fact about an item
that is not reproduced there.

You are reading **draft** content at the very bottom of the library — the ZFC
axioms and the set-theoretic treatment of relations and functions. Everything
above rests on it, so a wrong step here is inherited by thousands of results.
This material is elementary, which makes it easy to wave through. Do not.

## Your standard

Read the target item's **Statement/Definition/Example**, its **Facts &
Assumptions** block, and **every numbered step of its Proof / Verification /
Refutation** as someone trying to break it. For each step ask:

1. Does the cited material **mathematically license exactly what the step
   claims** — no more? The dominant defect class in this corpus is a fact
   restated more strongly than its source supports.
2. Is each `[F#]`/`[L#]` fact a **faithful** rendering of the dependency it
   names? Compare it against the dependency's full text, which is supplied.
   Check domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, direction, and conclusion. An invented
   converse is fatal.
3. Does the **title or Statement assert more than the proof delivers**? A judge
   who reads only the Statement cannot see a false title, so you must.
4. **Boundary cases.** The empty set, the empty family, the empty relation,
   functions out of and into $\varnothing$, $\mathcal{P}(\varnothing)$,
   $A \times \varnothing$, $\bigcap\varnothing$, zero- and one-element index
   sets, and **both directions of every "if and only if"**. This is where this
   material ships falsehoods.
5. **Circularity.** Does a proof use, directly or through a cited fact, the very
   thing it is establishing — or a result that is itself proved from it? Two such
   defects were already found on these pages.

## What counts, and what does not

- **Report** a concrete false claim, an unlicensed inference, a missing
  hypothesis, an inaccurate or overstated citation, a boundary case the proof
  silently assumes away, or a circularity. Name the exact step or fact and say
  **why**, with the counterexample or the missing hypothesis made explicit.
- **Do not report** a gap a competent reader closes in 30 seconds, a stylistic
  preference, a suggestion to add exposition, or a complaint that a step is
  "not fully rigorous" without naming what is actually wrong.
- Before alleging a cited dependency is too weak, **read the dependency text
  supplied below**. If it does support the step, say so.

You return **evidence, never edits**. You do not have write access and must not
propose file changes. An adjudicator reads your findings against the real files
and decides.

## Output format

Reply with exactly this structure, and nothing else:

```
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

Then, if `DEFECTS`, one block per finding:

```
FINDING 1
  location: [the exact step number, fact label, title, or Statement]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [what the item asserts there]
  defect:   [precisely what is wrong, with the counterexample or missing hypothesis]
```

Then always, last:

```
BOUNDARY: [one line per boundary case you checked and its disposition]
CHECKED:  [one line confirming you read every numbered step and every cited fact]
```

Be terse. No preamble, no summary of the mathematics, no praise.

## Statement

Let $(A_i)_{i \in I}$ be an indexed family. Then

- (i) if $I = \varnothing$ then $\prod_{i \in I} A_i = \{\varnothing\}$;
- (ii) if $A_j = \varnothing$ for some $j \in I$ then $\prod_{i \in I} A_i = \varnothing$;
- (iii) if $I = \{j\}$ then the evaluation $e := \{\,(f,a) \in (\prod_{i \in I} A_i) \times A_j : a = f(j)\,\}$ is a bijection $\prod_{i \in I} A_i \to A_j$.

Clauses (i) and (ii) pull in opposite directions and are the two cases most often
mis-stated: an empty index set gives a product with one element, while a single
empty member collapses the product entirely.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** an indexed family $(A_i)_{i \in I}$.

[L1] an element of $\prod_{i \in I} A_i$ is a function with domain $I$ that takes its value at each index inside the member carried by that index ([[def-product-of-an-indexed-family]]).

[L2] A **function** is a relation $f$ such that $(a,b) \in f$ and $(a,c) \in f$ imply $b = c$ ([[def-function]]).

[L3] $\operatorname{dom} R := \{\, a : \exists b\ (a,b) \in R \,\}, \qquad \operatorname{ran} R := \{\, b : \exists a\ (a,b) \in R \,\}$ ([[def-relation-domain-range-and-field]]).

[L4] $f$ is **injective** (one-to-one) if $f(x) = f(y)$ implies $x = y$, for all $x, y \in A$ ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L5] $f$ is **surjective** (onto) if for every $b \in B$ there is some $x \in A$ with $f(x) = b$ ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L6] $f = g$ if and only if $\operatorname{dom} f = \operatorname{dom} g$ and $f(x) = g(x)$ for every $x \in \operatorname{dom} f$ ([[lem-two-functions-are-equal-exactly-when-they-agree-at-every-point]]).

[L7] There is exactly one set with no elements, written $\varnothing$ ([[thm-the-empty-set-exists-and-is-unique]]).

[L8] $\{x,y\}$ is the set whose elements are exactly $x$ and $y$, and $\{x\} := \{x,x\}$ ([[def-unordered-pair-and-singleton]]).

[L9] For any parameters $\bar p$ and any set $x$, there is a set $y$ whose elements are exactly the elements $z$ of $x$ for which $\varphi(z,\bar p)$ holds ([[def-axiom-schema-of-separation]]).

[L10] $z \in A \times B$ holds if and only if $z = (a,b)$ for some $a \in A$ and some $b \in B$ ([[def-cartesian-product]]).

[L11] $z \in \bigcup_{i \in I} A_i$ holds if and only if $z \in A_i$ for some $i \in I$ ([[def-indexed-union-and-intersection]]).

[L12] If every $z$ satisfies $z \in x$ if and only if $z \in y$, then $x = y$ ([[def-axiom-of-extensionality]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Claim (i): let $I = \varnothing$. A function with domain $\varnothing$ has no elements, since each of its elements would be a pair whose first coordinate lies in its domain, so the only such function is $\varnothing$; and it satisfies the condition "$f(i) \in A_i$ for every $i \in I$" vacuously. Hence $\varnothing$ is the only element of the product, and the product is $\{\varnothing\}$. [L1, L2, L3, L7, L8, L12]

1.2 Claim (ii): let $j \in I$ with $A_j = \varnothing$. An element $f$ of the product would satisfy $f(j) \in A_j$, and $\varnothing$ has no elements; so the product has no elements. [L1, L7, L12]

1.3 Claim (iii), the map: let $I = \{j\}$ and write $P := \prod_{i \in I} A_i$. Each $f \in P$ has $f(j) \in A_j$, so $e$ as displayed is a set by separation inside $P \times A_j$, is single valued because $f(j)$ is, has domain $P$, and has range inside $A_j$; thus $e : P \to A_j$ with $e(f) = f(j)$. [L1, L2, L3, L9, L10]

2.1 Claim (iii), injectivity: if $e(f) = e(g)$ for $f, g \in P$, then $f$ and $g$ have the same domain $\{j\}$ and agree at $j$, hence are equal. [L4, L6, L8, step 1.3]

2.2 Claim (iii), surjectivity: let $a \in A_j$ and put $f := \{(j,a)\}$. This is a function with domain $\{j\}$ and $f(j) = a \in A_j$, and $a$ lies in $\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i$, so $f \in P$ and $e(f) = a$. [L1, L2, L3, L5, L8, L11, step 1.3]

3.1 Claims (i), (ii) and (iii) are established, which is the statement. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, step 2.1, step 2.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the general question is settled, and where it is not.** These three computations use no choice principle: in (i) and (ii) nothing is selected, and in (iii) the single value $f(j)$ is determined. None of them is an instance of the general question, because each names its elements outright. Whether a product of nonempty members over an arbitrary index set is nonempty is that general question, and it is exactly the product formulation of the Axiom of Choice, stated earlier on this page at [[def-axiom-of-choice]]; clause (ii) is the reason that formulation carries the hypothesis that every member is nonempty.

## Definition

Let $(A_i)_{i \in I}$ be an indexed family ([[def-indexed-family]]) and write
$C := \bigcup_{i \in I} A_i$ ([[def-indexed-union-and-intersection]]). By
[[lem-the-product-of-an-indexed-family-is-a-set]] the following collection is a
set; it is the **product** of the family:

$$\prod_{i \in I} A_i \;:=\; \{\, f : I \to C \ \mid\ f(i) \in A_i \text{ for every } i \in I \,\}.$$

So an element of $\prod_{i \in I} A_i$ is a function with domain $I$ that takes
its value at each index inside the member carried by that index; "function" is as
in [[def-function]].

## Remarks

- **Nonemptiness of the product is exactly the Axiom of Choice.** Nothing in
  this definition decides whether $\prod_{i \in I} A_i$ is nonempty when every
  $A_i$ is nonempty. That assertion, for an arbitrary index set, is one of the
  standard formulations of the Axiom of Choice, stated later on this page at
  [[def-axiom-of-choice]]. The product formulation recorded there, that
  $\prod_{i \in I} X_i$ is nonempty whenever every $X_i$ is nonempty, quantifies
  over exactly the object defined here: it is this definition that fixes what
  the symbol $\prod$ in that formulation denotes, and what its elements are.
  What *is* decided without any choice principle is the degenerate arithmetic:
  the empty index set and a family with an empty member, both in
  [[prop-products-over-small-index-sets]], together with the families whose
  product can be written down explicitly.

- **Why the ambient set is $C^{I}$.** The definition separates inside the set of
  all functions $I \to C$, so the ambient set must contain every function with
  domain $I$ whose value at $i$ lies in $A_i$. Taking $C$ to be the union of the
  members secures that, since such a value lies in $A_i$ and hence in $C$; and
  $C$ is the smallest set that includes every member of the family.

## Definition

A **function** is a relation $f$ such that $(a,b) \in f$ and $(a,c) \in f$ imply
$b = c$; "relation" is as in [[def-relation-domain-range-and-field]].

For $a \in \operatorname{dom} f$ there is such a $b$, and by the condition just
stated there is only one; $f(a)$ denotes that unique $b$, so that
$(a,b) \in f$ holds if and only if $a \in \operatorname{dom} f$ and $b = f(a)$
([[thm-the-characterising-property-of-ordered-pairs]]).

We write $f : A \to B$, and say $f$ is a **function from $A$ to $B$**, when $f$
is a function with $\operatorname{dom} f = A$ and
$\operatorname{ran} f \subseteq B$ ([[def-subset-and-proper-subset]]); $A$ is the
**domain** of $f$ and $B$ is a **codomain** for $f$. Equivalently
$f \subseteq A \times B$ with $\operatorname{dom} f = A$
([[def-cartesian-product]], [[def-ordered-pair]]).

## Remarks

- **The codomain belongs to the declaration, not to the set.** A function is a
  set of ordered pairs, and that set determines its domain and its range but not
  a codomain: the same $f$ satisfies $f : A \to B$ for every $B$ containing
  $\operatorname{ran} f$. So being onto is a property of the declaration
  $f : A \to B$ rather than of $f$, while being one-to-one is a property of $f$
  alone. This convention is what makes $\varnothing$ a function
  $\varnothing \to B$ for every $B$ at once.

- **Total on its domain by construction.** There is no partial function here: if
  $a \notin \operatorname{dom} f$ then $f(a)$ is not defined, and a function
  $f : A \to B$ has $\operatorname{dom} f$ equal to $A$ exactly, not merely
  included in it.

## Definition

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets and let $f : A \to B$ be a function.

- $f$ is **injective** (one-to-one) if $f(x) = f(y)$ implies $x = y$, for all
  $x, y \in A$.
- $f$ is **surjective** (onto) if for every $b \in B$ there is some $x \in A$
  with $f(x) = b$; equivalently, the image $f[A] := \{ f(x) : x \in A \}$ equals
  $B$.
- $f$ is **bijective** if it is both injective and surjective.

For $S \subseteq A$ we write $f[S] = \{ f(x) : x \in S \}$ for the image of $S$,
and for $T \subseteq B$ we write $f^{-1}[T] = \{ x \in A : f(x) \in T \}$ for the
preimage of $T$.

## Remarks

- **Composition.** If $f : A \to B$ and $g : B \to C$ are both injective then so
  is $g \circ f$, since $g(f(x)) = g(f(y))$ forces $f(x) = f(y)$ and then
  $x = y$; if both are surjective then so is $g \circ f$, since any $c \in C$ is
  $g(b)$ for some $b \in B$ and that $b$ is $f(a)$ for some $a \in A$. Hence a
  composition of bijections is a bijection. These one-line verifications are used
  silently throughout the library.

- **Inverses.** $f : A \to B$ is bijective exactly when there is a function
  $f^{-1} : B \to A$ with $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ for all $x \in A$ and
  $f(f^{-1}(b)) = b$ for all $b \in B$; that two-sided inverse is unique, and it
  is itself a bijection. Injectivity alone gives a bijection from $A$ onto the
  image $f[A]$, and hence an inverse defined on $f[A]$ only. No choice principle
  is involved: the value $f^{-1}(b)$ is the *unique* $x$ with $f(x) = b$, so it
  is determined rather than selected.

- **What this item does and does not do.** Functions, ordered pairs, Cartesian
  products, images and preimages are ambient ZFC vocabulary in this library, on
  the same footing as "subset" and "union": a function $A \to B$ is a set of
  ordered pairs, single valued and total on $A$. This item only fixes the three
  adjectives and the notation used for them. Nothing here is proved, and nothing
  here is assumed beyond the set-theoretic background already in use.

## Statement

There is exactly one set with no elements: there is a set $e$ such that
$\neg\exists z\,(z \in e)$, and any two such sets are equal. That set is written
$\varnothing$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** the language of set theory, in which the domain of discourse is nonempty ([[def-language-of-set-theory]]).

[L1] For any parameters $\bar p$ and any set $x$, there is a set $y$ whose elements are exactly the elements $z$ of $x$ for which $\varphi(z,\bar p)$ holds ([[def-axiom-schema-of-separation]]).

[L2] If every $z$ satisfies $z \in x$ if and only if $z \in y$, then $x = y$ ([[def-axiom-of-extensionality]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The domain of discourse is nonempty, so fix a set $a$. [given, choose]

2.1 Apply Separation to $a$ with the formula $\varphi(z) := \neg(z = z)$: there is a set $e$ such that, for every $z$, $z \in e$ holds if and only if $z \in a$ and $\neg(z = z)$. [L1, step 1.1]

3.1 No $z$ satisfies $\neg(z = z)$, so no $z$ satisfies $z \in e$; hence $e$ is a set with no elements, which proves existence. [step 2.1]

4.1 If $e'$ is also a set with no elements, then $z \in e$ and $z \in e'$ both fail for every $z$, so $z \in e$ holds if and only if $z \in e'$, and therefore $e = e'$; existence and uniqueness together give the statement, and $\varnothing$ denotes this set. [L2, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Existence is derived, not assumed.** Several presentations take "there is a set with no elements" as an axiom of its own. Here it is a theorem, because the nonemptiness of the domain of discourse is already a validity of first-order logic and Separation converts any set whatever into this one.

## Definition

A **relation** is a set $R$ every element of which is an ordered pair
([[def-ordered-pair]]). We write $a\,R\,b$ for $(a,b) \in R$.

By [[lem-the-domain-and-range-of-a-relation-are-sets]] the following two classes
are sets, so the notation is legitimate:

$$\operatorname{dom} R := \{\, a : \exists b\ (a,b) \in R \,\}, \qquad \operatorname{ran} R := \{\, b : \exists a\ (a,b) \in R \,\},$$

the **domain** and the **range** of $R$. The **field** of $R$ is
$\operatorname{fld} R := \operatorname{dom} R \cup \operatorname{ran} R$
([[def-union-of-a-set-and-binary-union]]).

$R$ is a **relation from $A$ to $B$** when $R \subseteq A \times B$
([[def-cartesian-product]], [[def-subset-and-proper-subset]]), and a **relation
on $A$** when $R \subseteq A \times A$.

## Remarks

- **Domain and range are intrinsic; the sets $A$ and $B$ are not.** A relation
  determines its own domain and range, but it is a relation from $A$ to $B$ for
  many different $A$ and $B$: any $A$ containing $\operatorname{dom} R$ and any
  $B$ containing $\operatorname{ran} R$ will do. That is the content of
  [[lem-a-relation-is-included-in-the-product-of-its-domain-and-range]], and it
  is the same distinction that makes a codomain part of the declaration
  $f : A \to B$ rather than of the set $f$ in [[def-function]].

- **The empty set is a relation.** It has no elements, so the requirement that
  every element be an ordered pair holds vacuously, and
  $\operatorname{dom} \varnothing = \operatorname{ran} \varnothing = \varnothing$.
  It is a relation on every set.

## Definition

Let $x$ and $y$ be sets. [[def-axiom-of-pairing]] gives a set whose elements are
exactly $x$ and $y$, and [[def-axiom-of-extensionality]] shows there is only one
such set; it is written $\{x,y\}$. Thus $\{x,y\}$ is the set whose elements are
exactly $x$ and $y$, and $\{x\} := \{x,x\}$, the **singleton** of $x$, is the set
whose only element is $x$:

$$t \in \{x,y\} \leftrightarrow (t = x \vee t = y), \qquad t \in \{x\} \leftrightarrow t = x .$$

## Remarks

- **The pair is unordered.** $t = x \vee t = y$ and $t = y \vee t = x$ are the
  same condition, so $\{x,y\} = \{y,x\}$, and the notation records no order.
  [[lem-unordered-pair-equality]] says exactly how much information a pair does
  carry, and [[def-ordered-pair]] is the construction that recovers an order from
  unordered pairs alone.

- **A singleton is not its element.** $\{x\}$ has exactly one element, namely
  $x$, and $x$ and $\{x\}$ are different sets whenever they have different
  elements; $\{\varnothing\}$ has one element while $\varnothing$ has none, so
  the two are already distinct at the bottom of the hierarchy.

## Definition

Let $\varphi(z, \bar p)$ be a formula of the language of set theory
([[def-language-of-set-theory]]) in which the variable $y$ does not occur free.
The **Separation instance** for $\varphi$ is the sentence

$$\forall \bar p\,\forall x\,\exists y\,\forall z\,\bigl(z \in y \leftrightarrow (z \in x \wedge \varphi(z,\bar p))\bigr).$$

The **Axiom Schema of Separation** is the collection of all these sentences, one
for each such $\varphi$. In words: for any parameters $\bar p$ and any set $x$,
there is a set $y$ whose elements are exactly the elements $z$ of $x$ for which
$\varphi(z,\bar p)$ holds.

It is a schema and not a single axiom because $\varphi$ ranges over the formulas
of the language, of which there are infinitely many, and the language provides no
way to quantify over them.

## Remarks

- **The side condition is not decoration.** If $y$ were allowed to occur free in
  $\varphi$, the instance $\varphi(z,\bar p) := z \notin y$ would assert that
  some $y$ satisfies $z \in y \leftrightarrow (z \in x \wedge z \notin y)$ for
  every $z$, which is contradictory as soon as $x$ has a member. Requiring $y$ to
  be fresh is what keeps the schema consistent.

- **One parameter or a list.** Some presentations state the schema with a single
  parameter $p$ rather than a list $\bar p$; the two forms prove the same
  theorems, since a finite list can be coded once ordered pairs are available.
  The list form is used here because the instances below quantify over several
  sets at once.

- **A separated set is unique.** The instance is stated with $\leftrightarrow$,
  so any two sets it produces have the same elements and are equal by
  [[def-axiom-of-extensionality]]. That is what licenses the notation
  $\{\, z \in x : \varphi(z,\bar p) \,\}$ introduced at
  [[def-subset-and-proper-subset]].

## Definition

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. By
[[lem-ordered-pairs-lie-in-the-double-power-set]] every ordered pair $(a,b)$ with
$a \in A$ and $b \in B$ is an element of $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(A \cup B))$, so
[[def-axiom-schema-of-separation]] applied inside that set produces the
**Cartesian product**

$$A \times B := \{\, z \in \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(A \cup B)) : \exists a \in A\ \exists b \in B\ z = (a,b) \,\}.$$

Its elements are exactly the ordered pairs $(a,b)$ ([[def-ordered-pair]]) with
$a \in A$ and $b \in B$: no such pair is lost, because each such pair lies in
the ambient set being separated. Thus $z \in A \times B$ holds if and only if
$z = (a,b)$ for some $a \in A$ and some $b \in B$.

## Remarks

- **Why the ambient set is needed.** "The set of all ordered pairs with first
  coordinate in $A$ and second in $B$" is a class abbreviation, and no axiom
  turns a class abbreviation into a set on its own. The double power set is what
  supplies a set to separate inside, so the product costs
  [[def-axiom-of-power-set]] and [[def-axiom-of-union]] as well as Separation;
  [[rem-which-axiom-each-construction-uses]] keeps the account.

- **Products of nonempty sets.** Whether a product of *two* nonempty sets is
  nonempty is settled here, by exhibiting the pair
  ([[prop-cartesian-products-and-set-operations]]). The corresponding question
  for a product of an arbitrary indexed family of nonempty sets is not settled by
  the axioms on this page: it is one formulation of the Axiom of Choice, stated
  at [[def-axiom-of-choice]].

## Statement

Let $f$ and $g$ be functions. Then $f = g$ if and only if
$\operatorname{dom} f = \operatorname{dom} g$ and $f(x) = g(x)$ for every
$x \in \operatorname{dom} f$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** functions $f$ and $g$.

[L1] A **function** is a relation $f$ such that $(a,b) \in f$ and $(a,c) \in f$ imply $b = c$ ([[def-function]]).

[L2] $\operatorname{dom} R := \{\, a : \exists b\ (a,b) \in R \,\}$ ([[def-relation-domain-range-and-field]]).

[L3] $(a,b) = (c,d)$ if and only if $a = c$ and $b = d$ ([[thm-the-characterising-property-of-ordered-pairs]]).

[L4] If every $z$ satisfies $z \in x$ if and only if $z \in y$, then $x = y$ ([[def-axiom-of-extensionality]]).

[L5] $(a,b) := \{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$ ([[def-ordered-pair]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 From left to right: if $f = g$ then the two sets have the same elements, so the defining conditions for the domain and for the value at a point are the same for both. [L1, L2, L4]

1.2 From right to left: assume $\operatorname{dom} f = \operatorname{dom} g$ and $f(x) = g(x)$ for every $x$ in that set. Let $z \in f$. Then $z$ is an ordered pair $(x,y)$ with $x \in \operatorname{dom} f$ and $y = f(x)$; hence $x \in \operatorname{dom} g$ and $y = g(x)$, so $z \in g$. The same argument with $f$ and $g$ exchanged gives the reverse inclusion, so the two sets have the same elements. [L1, L2, L3, L4, L5]

2.1 Both implications hold, which is the statement. [step 1.1, step 1.2] ∎

## Definition

Let $(A_i)_{i \in I}$ be an indexed family ([[def-indexed-family]]). Its
**indexed union** is

$$\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i \;:=\; \bigcup \{A_i : i \in I\},$$

the union of its range ([[def-union-of-a-set-and-binary-union]]); so
$z \in \bigcup_{i \in I} A_i$ holds if and only if $z \in A_i$ for some
$i \in I$.

When $I \neq \varnothing$ its **indexed intersection** is

$$\bigcap_{i \in I} A_i \;:=\; \bigcap \{A_i : i \in I\},$$

which is legitimate because a family with $I \neq \varnothing$ has a value at
some index, so its range is nonempty
([[def-relation-domain-range-and-field]]) and
[[lem-the-intersection-of-a-nonempty-set-is-a-set]] applies
([[def-intersection-of-a-set-and-binary-intersection]]); so
$z \in \bigcap_{i \in I} A_i$ holds if and only if $z \in A_i$ for every
$i \in I$.

## Remarks

- **The empty index set.** $\bigcup_{i \in \varnothing} A_i = \varnothing$,
  because the empty family has empty range and $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$
  ([[thm-the-empty-set-exists-and-is-unique]]). The indexed intersection is left
  undefined there, for the reason recorded at
  [[cor-the-empty-family-has-no-intersection]]: no set has every set as an
  element.

- **Indexing changes nothing about the operations.** Both notations are the
  primitive $\bigcup$ and $\bigcap$ applied to the range of the family, so every
  law proved for $\bigcup F$ and $\bigcap F$ transfers verbatim; that transfer is
  [[cor-distributive-and-de-morgan-laws-for-indexed-families]].

## Definition

The **Axiom of Extensionality** is the sentence

$$\forall x\,\forall y\,\bigl(\forall z\,(z \in x \leftrightarrow z \in y) \to x = y\bigr)$$

of the language of set theory ([[def-language-of-set-theory]]): if every $z$
satisfies $z \in x$ if and only if $z \in y$, then $x = y$.

A set is therefore determined by its members and by nothing else. Order,
repetition and any description used to present a set are invisible to identity.

## Remarks

- **The converse is logic, not an axiom.** If $x = y$ then $z \in x$ and
  $z \in y$ are the same statement for every $z$, by the substitution rule for
  equality. So Extensionality upgrades to the biconditional
  $x = y \leftrightarrow \forall z\,(z \in x \leftrightarrow z \in y)$, and only
  the left-to-right direction of that biconditional is assumed.

- **What it is used for below.** Every construction on this page produces a set
  by an axiom that specifies its members, and every such axiom is stated with
  $\leftrightarrow$. Extensionality is what turns "a set with these members" into
  "*the* set with these members", so it is the licence for each definite article
  and each piece of notation introduced here.

## Definition

The **Axiom of Choice** (AC) is the following statement.

> Every family of nonempty sets has a choice function
> ([[def-choice-function]]).

Written out: for every set $\mathcal{F}$ all of whose members are nonempty,
there exists a function $g$ with domain $\mathcal{F}$ satisfying $g(S) \in S$ for
all $S \in \mathcal{F}$.

An equivalent formulation, immediate from the definition of the Cartesian
product, is that a product of nonempty sets is nonempty: if $X_i \ne \emptyset$
for every $i \in I$, then $\prod_{i \in I} X_i \ne \emptyset$.

## Remarks

- **This is an axiom, not a theorem, and it is deliberately not derived here.**
  **Assume ZF is consistent.** Then AC is independent of the remaining axioms of
  Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory: Gödel (1938) showed that ZF, if consistent, cannot
  refute it ([[rem-godel-constructible-universe]]), and Cohen (1963) showed that
  ZF, if consistent, cannot prove it ([[rem-cohen-forcing-ac-independent]]). The
  consistency hypothesis is not decoration and cannot be dropped: an inconsistent
  ZF proves everything, AC included, so both halves of the independence would
  fail. Nor can the hypothesis be discharged inside ZF. Both directions also
  require machinery (the constructible universe and forcing) that this library
  does not yet contain, so both are recorded with references rather than proved.
  [[fs-zorn-provable-in-zf]] is the corresponding warning and carries the same
  consistency assumption explicitly in its Given; [[rem-choice-strengths]]
  locates the weaker choice principles.
- Being an axiom, AC carries no well-definedness obligation, which is why this
  item has no `justified_by`.
- The case of a family listed by a natural number, which is the finite case once
  finiteness is defined, is a theorem of ZF and needs no axiom
  ([[lem-finite-choice]]). AC is exactly the extension of that theorem to
  arbitrary index sets, and the gap between the two is not a matter of degree:
  [[ex-russells-socks]] exhibits the difference concretely.
- "ZFC" abbreviates ZF together with AC. Everything on this page after
  [[lem-finite-choice]] that invokes AC is flagged as doing so, because later
  pages need to state honestly which of their theorems are choice-free; that
  bookkeeping is the purpose of [[rem-choice-strengths]].
