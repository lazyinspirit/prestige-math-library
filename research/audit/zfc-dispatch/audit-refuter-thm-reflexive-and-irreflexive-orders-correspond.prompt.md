# Proof-refuter brief — run `zfc`, step 6

You are a **read-only adversarial proof-refuter** for a public mathematics
library. You have no filesystem and no web access: **everything you may rely on
is in the "This dispatch" section below.** Do not assume any fact about an item
that is not reproduced there.

You are reading **draft** content at the very bottom of the library — the ZFC
axioms and the set-theoretic treatment of relations and functions. Everything
above rests on it, so a wrong step here is inherited by thousands of results.
This material is elementary, which makes it easy to wave through. Do not.

## Your standard

Read the target item's **Statement/Definition/Example**, its **Facts &
Assumptions** block, and **every numbered step of its Proof / Verification /
Refutation** as someone trying to break it. For each step ask:

1. Does the cited material **mathematically license exactly what the step
   claims** — no more? The dominant defect class in this corpus is a fact
   restated more strongly than its source supports.
2. Is each `[F#]`/`[L#]` fact a **faithful** rendering of the dependency it
   names? Compare it against the dependency's full text, which is supplied.
   Check domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, direction, and conclusion. An invented
   converse is fatal.
3. Does the **title or Statement assert more than the proof delivers**? A judge
   who reads only the Statement cannot see a false title, so you must.
4. **Boundary cases.** The empty set, the empty family, the empty relation,
   functions out of and into $\varnothing$, $\mathcal{P}(\varnothing)$,
   $A \times \varnothing$, $\bigcap\varnothing$, zero- and one-element index
   sets, and **both directions of every "if and only if"**. This is where this
   material ships falsehoods.
5. **Circularity.** Does a proof use, directly or through a cited fact, the very
   thing it is establishing — or a result that is itself proved from it? Two such
   defects were already found on these pages.

## What counts, and what does not

- **Report** a concrete false claim, an unlicensed inference, a missing
  hypothesis, an inaccurate or overstated citation, a boundary case the proof
  silently assumes away, or a circularity. Name the exact step or fact and say
  **why**, with the counterexample or the missing hypothesis made explicit.
- **Do not report** a gap a competent reader closes in 30 seconds, a stylistic
  preference, a suggestion to add exposition, or a complaint that a step is
  "not fully rigorous" without naming what is actually wrong.
- Before alleging a cited dependency is too weak, **read the dependency text
  supplied below**. If it does support the step, say so.

You return **evidence, never edits**. You do not have write access and must not
propose file changes. An adjudicator reads your findings against the real files
and decides.

## Output format

Reply with exactly this structure, and nothing else:

```
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

Then, if `DEFECTS`, one block per finding:

```
FINDING 1
  location: [the exact step number, fact label, title, or Statement]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [what the item asserts there]
  defect:   [precisely what is wrong, with the counterexample or missing hypothesis]
```

Then always, last:

```
BOUNDARY: [one line per boundary case you checked and its disposition]
CHECKED:  [one line confirming you read every numbered step and every cited fact]
```

Be terse. No preamble, no summary of the mathematics, no praise.

## Statement

Let $A$ be a set. Write $\mathcal{R}$ for the collection of relations on $A$ that
are reflexive on $A$, antisymmetric and transitive — that is, the partial orders
on $A$ in the sense of [[def-partial-order]] — and $\mathcal{S}$ for the
collection of relations on $A$ that are irreflexive and transitive. Then:

- (i) $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{S}$ are sets, both subsets of $\mathcal{P}(A \times A)$;
- (ii) every $S \in \mathcal{S}$ is asymmetric;
- (iii) $R \setminus \Delta_A \in \mathcal{S}$ for every $R \in \mathcal{R}$;
- (iv) $S \cup \Delta_A \in \mathcal{R}$ for every $S \in \mathcal{S}$;
- (v) $(R \setminus \Delta_A) \cup \Delta_A = R$ for every $R \in \mathcal{R}$, and $(S \cup \Delta_A) \setminus \Delta_A = S$ for every $S \in \mathcal{S}$;
- (vi) for every $R \in \mathcal{R}$ and all $x, y$, the pair $(x,y)$ lies in $R \setminus \Delta_A$ if and only if $(x,y) \in R$ and $x \neq y$; that is, $R \setminus \Delta_A$ is exactly the strict order associated with the partial order $R$.

Clauses (iii) to (v) are what it means for the two assignments to be mutually
inverse bijections between $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{S}$, and clause (vi)
identifies the first assignment with the passage from a partial order to its
strict order.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** a set $A$.

[L1] $R$ is **reflexive on $A$** when $(a,a) \in R$ for every $a \in A$ ([[def-properties-of-a-relation-on-a-set]]).

[L2] $R$ is **irreflexive** when $(a,a) \notin R$ for every $a \in A$ ([[def-properties-of-a-relation-on-a-set]]).

[L3] $R$ is **antisymmetric** when $(a,b) \in R$ and $(b,a) \in R$ imply $a = b$, for all $a, b \in A$ ([[def-properties-of-a-relation-on-a-set]]).

[L4] $R$ is **transitive** when $(a,b) \in R$ and $(b,c) \in R$ imply $(a,c) \in R$, for all $a, b, c \in A$ ([[def-properties-of-a-relation-on-a-set]]).

[L5] $R$ is **asymmetric** when $(a,b) \in R$ implies $(b,a) \notin R$, for all $a, b \in A$ ([[def-properties-of-a-relation-on-a-set]]).

[L6] $(a,b) \in \Delta_A$ holds if and only if $a = b$ and $a \in A$ ([[def-the-identity-and-membership-relations-on-a-set]]).

[L7] $z \in a \setminus b$ holds exactly when $z \in a$ and $z \notin b$ ([[def-set-difference-and-symmetric-difference]]).

[L8] $z \in a \cup b$ holds if and only if $z \in a$ or $z \in b$ ([[lem-unions-and-intersections-of-small-families]]).

[L9] If every $z$ satisfies $z \in x$ if and only if $z \in y$, then $x = y$ ([[def-axiom-of-extensionality]]).

[L10] $z \in \mathcal{P}(x)$ holds if and only if $z \subseteq x$ ([[def-power-set]]).

[L11] For any parameters $\bar p$ and any set $x$, there is a set $y$ whose elements are exactly the elements $z$ of $x$ for which $\varphi(z,\bar p)$ holds ([[def-axiom-schema-of-separation]]).

[L12] $R$ is a **relation on $A$** when $R \subseteq A \times A$ ([[def-relation-domain-range-and-field]]).

[L13] $z \in A \times B$ holds if and only if $z = (a,b)$ for some $a \in A$ and some $b \in B$ ([[def-cartesian-product]]).

[L14] $x \subseteq y$ means that every element of $x$ is an element of $y$ ([[def-subset-and-proper-subset]]).

[L15] A **partial order** on $P$ is a binary relation $\le$ on $P$ such that, for all $x, y, z \in P$: $x \le x$; if $x \le y$ and $y \le x$, then $x = y$; and if $x \le y$ and $y \le z$, then $x \le z$ ([[def-partial-order]]).

[L16] The **strict order** associated with a partial order $\le$ is defined by $x < y$ if and only if $x \le y$ and $x \ne y$ ([[def-partial-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Claim (i): a relation on $A$ is exactly an element of $\mathcal{P}(A \times A)$, so $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{S}$ are obtained by separating inside that set with the formulas expressing the three, respectively two, listed properties, with parameter $A$. [L10, L11, L12, L13, L14]

1.2 Claim (ii): let $S$ be irreflexive and transitive and suppose $(a,b) \in S$ and $(b,a) \in S$. Transitivity gives $(a,a) \in S$, which irreflexivity forbids; so $(a,b) \in S$ implies $(b,a) \notin S$. [L2, L4, L5]

1.3 Claim (vi): let $R \in \mathcal{R}$, so that $R$ is a partial order on $A$. If $(x,y) \in R$ then $x \in A$, because $R \subseteq A \times A$; so for such a pair $(x,y) \in \Delta_A$ holds exactly when $x = y$. Hence $(x,y) \in R \setminus \Delta_A$ if and only if $(x,y) \in R$ and $x \neq y$, and that is the defining condition of the strict order associated with $R$. [L6, L7, L12, L13, L15, L16]

2.1 Claim (iii): let $R \in \mathcal{R}$ and put $S := R \setminus \Delta_A$. For $a \in A$ the pair $(a,a)$ lies in $\Delta_A$, so it is not in $S$, and $S$ is irreflexive. If $(a,b) \in S$ and $(b,c) \in S$ then $(a,b),(b,c) \in R$, so $(a,c) \in R$; and $a = c$ would give $(a,b) \in R$ and $(b,a) \in R$, whence $a = b$ by antisymmetry, contradicting $(a,b) \notin \Delta_A$. So $(a,c) \notin \Delta_A$ and $(a,c) \in S$. Finally $S \subseteq R \subseteq A \times A$. [L2, L3, L4, L6, L7, L12, L14, step 1.2]

2.2 Claim (iv): let $S \in \mathcal{S}$ and put $R := S \cup \Delta_A$. Then $\Delta_A \subseteq R$, so $R$ is reflexive on $A$, and $R \subseteq A \times A$ since both parts are. If $(a,b),(b,a) \in R$ and $a \neq b$ then neither pair lies in $\Delta_A$, so both lie in $S$, contradicting asymmetry; hence $R$ is antisymmetric. If $(a,b),(b,c) \in R$, then $a = b$ or $b = c$ makes $(a,c)$ one of the two given pairs, and otherwise both lie in $S$ and transitivity of $S$ gives $(a,c) \in S \subseteq R$. [L1, L3, L4, L6, L8, L12, L14, step 1.2]

3.1 Claim (v): for $R \in \mathcal{R}$ reflexivity gives $\Delta_A \subseteq R$, so $(R \setminus \Delta_A) \cup \Delta_A$ and $R$ have the same elements; for $S \in \mathcal{S}$ irreflexivity gives that no element of $\Delta_A$ lies in $S$, so $(S \cup \Delta_A) \setminus \Delta_A$ and $S$ have the same elements. [L1, L2, L6, L7, L8, L9, step 2.1, step 2.2]

4.1 Clauses (i) to (vi) are established, so the two assignments send $\mathcal{R}$ into $\mathcal{S}$ and back and undo one another, and the first of them is the passage to the strict order, which is the statement. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the correspondence says about the vocabulary of [[def-partial-order]].** The relations collected in $\mathcal{R}$ are exactly the partial orders on $A$, and by clause (vi) the assignment $R \mapsto R \setminus \Delta_A$ is not a new construction but the one that item already performs when it passes from $\le$ to $<$. Clauses (iii) to (v) then say that nothing is lost either way: a partial order and its strict order carry the same information, and every irreflexive transitive relation arises as the strict order of exactly one partial order. Clause (ii) reconciles the definition of a strict order as irreflexive and transitive with the definition as asymmetric and transitive.

- **Connexity is untouched by the correspondence.** The extra clause that makes a partial order a total order in [[def-partial-order]] is connexity, and it is not carried across by $R \mapsto R \setminus \Delta_A$: a total order is connex on $A$, whereas an irreflexive relation relates no element of $A$ to itself, so it is connex on $A$ only when $A$ is empty. The strict counterpart of connexity is trichotomy, which is not among the properties fixed in [[def-properties-of-a-relation-on-a-set]], and the correspondence above is stated for partial orders rather than for total ones.

## Definition

Let $A$ be a set and let $R$ be a relation on $A$, that is
$R \subseteq A \times A$ ([[def-relation-domain-range-and-field]],
[[def-cartesian-product]]). Then $R$ is:

- **reflexive on $A$** when $(a,a) \in R$ for every $a \in A$;
- **irreflexive** when $(a,a) \notin R$ for every $a \in A$;
- **symmetric** when $(a,b) \in R$ implies $(b,a) \in R$, for all $a, b \in A$;
- **asymmetric** when $(a,b) \in R$ implies $(b,a) \notin R$, for all $a, b \in A$;
- **antisymmetric** when $(a,b) \in R$ and $(b,a) \in R$ imply $a = b$, for all $a, b \in A$;
- **transitive** when $(a,b) \in R$ and $(b,c) \in R$ imply $(a,c) \in R$, for all $a, b, c \in A$;
- **connex on $A$** when, for all $a, b \in A$, $(a,b) \in R$ or $(b,a) \in R$.

Reflexivity and irreflexivity have short forms in terms of the identity relation
$\Delta_A$ of [[def-the-identity-and-membership-relations-on-a-set]], because the
elements of $\Delta_A$ are exactly the pairs $(a,a)$ with $a \in A$: $R$ is
reflexive on $A$ if and only if $\Delta_A \subseteq R$
([[def-subset-and-proper-subset]]), and irreflexive if and only if $R$ and
$\Delta_A$ have no common element.

## Remarks

- **Reflexivity and connexity mention $A$; the others do not.** Whether $R$ is
  symmetric, asymmetric, antisymmetric or transitive depends on $R$ alone,
  whereas "reflexive on $A$" and "connex on $A$" depend on the ambient set: the
  empty relation is reflexive on $\varnothing$ and on no other set. The qualifier
  is therefore kept in the name of those two.

- **"Total" is ambiguous, "connex" is not.** The connex property above is also
  called *total* in much of the literature, but "total relation" is used
  elsewhere for the unrelated condition that every element of $A$ is related to
  something. Only "connex" is used here for the property defined above.

- **The named combinations, and the exact agreement with
  [[def-partial-order]].** That item names its structures in terms of a relation
  $\le$ on a set $P$, and each of its clauses is one of the properties above
  applied to $\le$, so the two vocabularies describe one set of conditions and
  not two:

  - a **partial order** on $P$ is a relation on $P$ satisfying its clauses (R),
    (A) and (T), which are reflexivity on $P$, antisymmetry and transitivity as
    defined above, quantified over the same set $P$;
  - the **strict order** $x < y :\Longleftrightarrow x \le y$ and $x \ne y$
    associated there with a partial order $\le$ is the relation
    $\le \setminus \Delta_P$ of the properties above, and it is irreflexive and
    transitive; that identification and the fact that nothing is lost in passing
    between the two presentations are proved in
    [[thm-reflexive-and-irreflexive-orders-correspond]], whose clause on
    asymmetry also reconciles the two usual definitions of a strict order;
  - two elements $x, y \in P$ are **comparable** there when $x \le y$ or
    $y \le x$, so a relation on $A$ is connex on $A$ exactly when every two
    elements of $A$ are comparable;
  - consequently what that item calls a **total order** — a partial order in
    which every two elements are comparable — is a relation on $P$ that is
    reflexive on $P$, antisymmetric, transitive and connex on $P$. "Connex"
    here and "total order" there are therefore the same condition read twice:
    connexity is the single extra clause that turns a partial order into a
    total one, and it is the connex reading of the word *total*, never the
    left-total one warned against above.

  Reflexive on $A$, symmetric and transitive is what
  [[def-equivalence-relation]] calls an equivalence relation.

## Definition

Let $P$ be a set. A **partial order** on $P$ is a binary relation $\le$ on $P$
such that, for all $x, y, z \in P$:

- **(R)** *reflexivity*: $x \le x$;
- **(A)** *antisymmetry*: if $x \le y$ and $y \le x$, then $x = y$;
- **(T)** *transitivity*: if $x \le y$ and $y \le z$, then $x \le z$.

The pair $(P, \le)$ is a **partially ordered set**, abbreviated **poset**. When
the order is clear we write $P$ for the pair.

The associated **strict order** is defined by
$$x < y \quad :\Longleftrightarrow \quad x \le y \text{ and } x \ne y.$$

Two elements $x, y \in P$ are **comparable** if $x \le y$ or $y \le x$, and
**incomparable** otherwise. A partial order in which every two elements are
comparable is a **total order** (equivalently a **linear order**), and $(P, \le)$
is then a **totally ordered set**.

## Remarks

- Partiality is the whole point: a partial order is permitted to leave pairs
  incomparable. Every statement below that concerns maximal elements, chains, or
  upper bounds is interesting precisely because incomparable pairs may exist; in
  a total order most of them collapse to something obvious.
- All three axioms are used essentially in the proofs on this page: reflexivity
  in [[lem-extremal-cut-closed-under-f]] and [[lem-successor-of-extremal]],
  transitivity almost everywhere, and antisymmetry in [[thm-bourbaki-witt]],
  where the fixed point is obtained by passing from $f(c) \le c$ and
  $c \le f(c)$ to $f(c) = c$. Antisymmetry is also what makes a least upper
  bound unique when it exists, and uniqueness is what licenses the functional
  notation $\sup$ used in [[def-chain-complete-poset]].
- Dropping antisymmetry gives a **preorder**. Preorders are genuinely useful
  elsewhere (a directed set is preordered), but they are not used on this page.
- Inclusion $\subseteq$ on the power set of any set is the standard example, and
  it is the concrete order the two applications on this page run in:
  [[thm-zorn]] applies [[thm-bourbaki-witt]] to the set of chains of $P$ ordered
  by inclusion, and [[thm-zorn-implies-ac]] applies Zorn's lemma to partial
  choice functions ordered by extension. The results themselves are stated for
  an *arbitrary* poset and are used that way: [[thm-zorn]] is applied to
  whatever poset a later page brings, and the refutation in
  [[fs-maximal-is-greatest]] runs in a bare two-element antichain that is not
  presented as an order by inclusion at all.

## Definition

Let $A$ be a set. The **identity relation** and the **membership relation** on
$A$ are

$$\Delta_A := \{\,(a,b) \in A \times A : a = b\,\}, \qquad \in_A \;:=\; \{\,(a,b) \in A \times A : a \in b\,\},$$

sets by [[def-axiom-schema-of-separation]] applied inside $A \times A$
([[def-cartesian-product]]), and relations on $A$ in the sense of
[[def-relation-domain-range-and-field]]. Thus $(a,b) \in \Delta_A$ holds if and
only if $a = b$ and $a \in A$, and $(a,b) \in \in_A$ holds if and only if
$a \in b$ and both lie in $A$ ([[def-ordered-pair]]).

## Remarks

- **$\Delta_A$ carries the set $A$ with it.** $\Delta_A$ and $\Delta_B$ are
  different relations when $A \neq B$, because
  $\operatorname{dom} \Delta_A = \operatorname{ran} \Delta_A = A$. That is what
  makes $\Delta_A$ usable as a neutral element for composition on the left and on
  the right, with the correct set in each position.

- **The membership relation is the one Foundation constrains.** $\in_A$ is set
  membership restricted to $A$, so
  [[thm-foundation-excludes-membership-cycles]] says that it has no cycle of
  length one, two or three.

## Definition

Let $a$ and $b$ be sets. The **difference** of $a$ and $b$ is

$$a \setminus b := \{\, z \in a : z \notin b \,\},$$

a set by [[def-axiom-schema-of-separation]] and the only one with those elements
by [[def-axiom-of-extensionality]]; so $z \in a \setminus b$ holds exactly when
$z \in a$ and $z \notin b$. The **symmetric difference** is

$$a \triangle b := (a \setminus b) \cup (b \setminus a),$$

formed with the binary union of [[def-union-of-a-set-and-binary-union]].

When $a \subseteq X$ ([[def-subset-and-proper-subset]]), the difference
$X \setminus a$ is called the **complement of $a$ relative to $X$**. The
qualification is not optional: there is no set of all sets
([[cor-there-is-no-set-of-all-sets]]), so an absolute complement, the class of
all sets not in $a$, is never a set.

## Remarks

- **Difference needs no hypothesis.** $a \setminus b$ is defined for all sets
  $a$ and $b$, with no assumption that $b \subseteq a$ or that the two meet.
  When they are disjoint, $a \setminus b = a$.

- **Symmetric difference collects what lies in exactly one of the two sets.**
  Unfolding the definition, $z \in a \triangle b$ holds exactly when $z$ belongs
  to $a$ or to $b$ but not to both.

## Definition

Let $x$ be a set. [[def-axiom-of-union]] gives a set whose elements are exactly
the sets $z$ belonging to some member of $x$, and [[def-axiom-of-extensionality]]
shows there is only one such set; it is written $\bigcup x$. Thus $\bigcup x$ is
the set whose elements are exactly the elements of the elements of $x$, and
$a \cup b := \bigcup\{a,b\}$ is the **binary union** of $a$ and $b$, formed from
the unordered pair of [[def-unordered-pair-and-singleton]]:

$$z \in \bigcup x \leftrightarrow \exists s\,(s \in x \wedge z \in s).$$

The membership criterion for the binary union, that $z \in a \cup b$ holds
exactly when $z \in a$ or $z \in b$, is proved at
[[lem-unions-and-intersections-of-small-families]] rather than assumed here.

## Remarks

- **One layer only.** $\bigcup x$ collects the elements of the elements of $x$,
  not the elements of $x$. For a set of sets of sets the operation therefore has
  to be applied twice, and that iteration is what makes
  $\bigcup\bigcup R$ the right ambient set for the domain and range of a
  relation.

- **Notation.** $\bigcup$ with a single set argument is the primitive operation
  supplied by the axiom; $\cup$ between two sets is the derived binary one. The
  indexed form $\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i$ is a further abbreviation, defined once
  indexed families are available.

## Statement

For all sets $a$ and $b$:

- (i) $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$;
- (ii) $\bigcup \{a\} = a$;
- (iii) $\bigcup \{a,b\} = a \cup b$, and $z \in a \cup b$ holds if and only if $z \in a$ or $z \in b$;
- (iv) $\bigcap \{a\} = a$;
- (v) $\bigcap \{a,b\} = a \cap b$, and $z \in a \cap b$ holds if and only if $z \in a$ and $z \in b$.

The equalities in (iii) and (v) are the definitions of $a \cup b$ and $a \cap b$
written out; what is proved about them here is the membership criterion beside
each.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** sets $a$ and $b$.

[L1] $\bigcup x$ is the set whose elements are exactly the elements of the elements of $x$, and $a \cup b := \bigcup\{a,b\}$ ([[def-union-of-a-set-and-binary-union]]).

[L2] For $x \neq \varnothing$, $\bigcap x$ is the set whose elements are exactly the sets belonging to every element of $x$, and $a \cap b := \bigcap\{a,b\}$ ([[def-intersection-of-a-set-and-binary-intersection]]).

[L3] $\{x,y\}$ is the set whose elements are exactly $x$ and $y$, and $\{x\} := \{x,x\}$ ([[def-unordered-pair-and-singleton]]).

[L4] There is exactly one set with no elements, written $\varnothing$ ([[thm-the-empty-set-exists-and-is-unique]]).

[L5] If every $z$ satisfies $z \in x$ if and only if $z \in y$, then $x = y$ ([[def-axiom-of-extensionality]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Claim (i): $z \in \bigcup \varnothing$ requires a member $s$ of $\varnothing$ with $z \in s$, and $\varnothing$ has no members, so $\bigcup \varnothing$ has no elements and is therefore $\varnothing$. [L1, L4]

1.2 Claim (ii): $z \in \bigcup \{a\}$ requires a member $s$ of $\{a\}$ with $z \in s$, and the only member of $\{a\}$ is $a$, so $z \in \bigcup\{a\}$ holds exactly when $z \in a$. [L1, L3]

1.3 Claim (iii): $a \cup b$ is $\bigcup\{a,b\}$ by definition, and $z \in \bigcup\{a,b\}$ requires a member $s$ of $\{a,b\}$ with $z \in s$; the members of $\{a,b\}$ are $a$ and $b$, so $z \in a \cup b$ holds exactly when $z \in a$ or $z \in b$. [L1, L3]

1.4 Claim (iv): $\{a\}$ is nonempty since $a$ is a member, and $z \in \bigcap\{a\}$ holds exactly when $z$ belongs to every member of $\{a\}$, that is, exactly when $z \in a$. [L2, L3]

1.5 Claim (v): $a \cap b$ is $\bigcap\{a,b\}$ by definition, $\{a,b\}$ is nonempty, and $z \in \bigcap\{a,b\}$ holds exactly when $z$ belongs to every member of $\{a,b\}$; the members are $a$ and $b$, so $z \in a \cap b$ holds exactly when $z \in a$ and $z \in b$. [L2, L3]

2.1 In each of the five claims the elements of the two sides have been shown to satisfy the same condition, so the sets are equal, which is the statement. [L5, step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, step 1.4, step 1.5] ∎

## Definition

The **Axiom of Extensionality** is the sentence

$$\forall x\,\forall y\,\bigl(\forall z\,(z \in x \leftrightarrow z \in y) \to x = y\bigr)$$

of the language of set theory ([[def-language-of-set-theory]]): if every $z$
satisfies $z \in x$ if and only if $z \in y$, then $x = y$.

A set is therefore determined by its members and by nothing else. Order,
repetition and any description used to present a set are invisible to identity.

## Remarks

- **The converse is logic, not an axiom.** If $x = y$ then $z \in x$ and
  $z \in y$ are the same statement for every $z$, by the substitution rule for
  equality. So Extensionality upgrades to the biconditional
  $x = y \leftrightarrow \forall z\,(z \in x \leftrightarrow z \in y)$, and only
  the left-to-right direction of that biconditional is assumed.

- **What it is used for below.** Every construction on this page produces a set
  by an axiom that specifies its members, and every such axiom is stated with
  $\leftrightarrow$. Extensionality is what turns "a set with these members" into
  "*the* set with these members", so it is the licence for each definite article
  and each piece of notation introduced here.

## Definition

A **relation** is a set $R$ every element of which is an ordered pair
([[def-ordered-pair]]). We write $a\,R\,b$ for $(a,b) \in R$.

By [[lem-the-domain-and-range-of-a-relation-are-sets]] the following two classes
are sets, so the notation is legitimate:

$$\operatorname{dom} R := \{\, a : \exists b\ (a,b) \in R \,\}, \qquad \operatorname{ran} R := \{\, b : \exists a\ (a,b) \in R \,\},$$

the **domain** and the **range** of $R$. The **field** of $R$ is
$\operatorname{fld} R := \operatorname{dom} R \cup \operatorname{ran} R$
([[def-union-of-a-set-and-binary-union]]).

$R$ is a **relation from $A$ to $B$** when $R \subseteq A \times B$
([[def-cartesian-product]], [[def-subset-and-proper-subset]]), and a **relation
on $A$** when $R \subseteq A \times A$.

## Remarks

- **Domain and range are intrinsic; the sets $A$ and $B$ are not.** A relation
  determines its own domain and range, but it is a relation from $A$ to $B$ for
  many different $A$ and $B$: any $A$ containing $\operatorname{dom} R$ and any
  $B$ containing $\operatorname{ran} R$ will do. That is the content of
  [[lem-a-relation-is-included-in-the-product-of-its-domain-and-range]], and it
  is the same distinction that makes a codomain part of the declaration
  $f : A \to B$ rather than of the set $f$ in [[def-function]].

- **The empty set is a relation.** It has no elements, so the requirement that
  every element be an ordered pair holds vacuously, and
  $\operatorname{dom} \varnothing = \operatorname{ran} \varnothing = \varnothing$.
  It is a relation on every set.

## Definition

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. By
[[lem-ordered-pairs-lie-in-the-double-power-set]] every ordered pair $(a,b)$ with
$a \in A$ and $b \in B$ is an element of $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(A \cup B))$, so
[[def-axiom-schema-of-separation]] applied inside that set produces the
**Cartesian product**

$$A \times B := \{\, z \in \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(A \cup B)) : \exists a \in A\ \exists b \in B\ z = (a,b) \,\}.$$

Its elements are exactly the ordered pairs $(a,b)$ ([[def-ordered-pair]]) with
$a \in A$ and $b \in B$: no such pair is lost, because each such pair lies in
the ambient set being separated. Thus $z \in A \times B$ holds if and only if
$z = (a,b)$ for some $a \in A$ and some $b \in B$.

## Remarks

- **Why the ambient set is needed.** "The set of all ordered pairs with first
  coordinate in $A$ and second in $B$" is a class abbreviation, and no axiom
  turns a class abbreviation into a set on its own. The double power set is what
  supplies a set to separate inside, so the product costs
  [[def-axiom-of-power-set]] and [[def-axiom-of-union]] as well as Separation;
  [[rem-which-axiom-each-construction-uses]] keeps the account.

- **Products of nonempty sets.** Whether a product of *two* nonempty sets is
  nonempty is settled here, by exhibiting the pair
  ([[prop-cartesian-products-and-set-operations]]). The corresponding question
  for a product of an arbitrary indexed family of nonempty sets is not settled by
  the axioms on this page: it is one formulation of the Axiom of Choice, stated
  at [[def-axiom-of-choice]].

## Definition

Let $x$ be a set. By [[lem-the-power-set-of-a-set-is-a-set]] there is exactly one
set whose elements are precisely the subsets of $x$
([[def-subset-and-proper-subset]]); it is the **power set** of $x$, written
$\mathcal{P}(x)$. Thus $z \in \mathcal{P}(x)$ holds if and only if
$z \subseteq x$, and in the class notation of the page,

$$\mathcal{P}(x) = \{\, z : z \subseteq x \,\}.$$

## Remarks

- **Two axioms, not one.** The elements of $\mathcal{P}(x)$ are pinned down by
  [[def-axiom-of-power-set]] together with
  [[def-axiom-schema-of-separation]], because the axiom is assumed here only in
  its implication form. [[rem-which-axiom-each-construction-uses]] keeps that
  cost visible.

- **The power set is never empty.** $\varnothing \subseteq x$ always holds, so
  $\varnothing \in \mathcal{P}(x)$ for every $x$; in particular
  $\mathcal{P}(\varnothing) = \{\varnothing\}$ rather than $\varnothing$. That
  and the other basic identities are
  [[prop-basic-properties-of-the-power-set]].

## Definition

Let $\varphi(z, \bar p)$ be a formula of the language of set theory
([[def-language-of-set-theory]]) in which the variable $y$ does not occur free.
The **Separation instance** for $\varphi$ is the sentence

$$\forall \bar p\,\forall x\,\exists y\,\forall z\,\bigl(z \in y \leftrightarrow (z \in x \wedge \varphi(z,\bar p))\bigr).$$

The **Axiom Schema of Separation** is the collection of all these sentences, one
for each such $\varphi$. In words: for any parameters $\bar p$ and any set $x$,
there is a set $y$ whose elements are exactly the elements $z$ of $x$ for which
$\varphi(z,\bar p)$ holds.

It is a schema and not a single axiom because $\varphi$ ranges over the formulas
of the language, of which there are infinitely many, and the language provides no
way to quantify over them.

## Remarks

- **The side condition is not decoration.** If $y$ were allowed to occur free in
  $\varphi$, the instance $\varphi(z,\bar p) := z \notin y$ would assert that
  some $y$ satisfies $z \in y \leftrightarrow (z \in x \wedge z \notin y)$ for
  every $z$, which is contradictory as soon as $x$ has a member. Requiring $y$ to
  be fresh is what keeps the schema consistent.

- **One parameter or a list.** Some presentations state the schema with a single
  parameter $p$ rather than a list $\bar p$; the two forms prove the same
  theorems, since a finite list can be coded once ordered pairs are available.
  The list form is used here because the instances below quantify over several
  sets at once.

- **A separated set is unique.** The instance is stated with $\leftrightarrow$,
  so any two sets it produces have the same elements and are equal by
  [[def-axiom-of-extensionality]]. That is what licenses the notation
  $\{\, z \in x : \varphi(z,\bar p) \,\}$ introduced at
  [[def-subset-and-proper-subset]].

## Definition

For sets $x$ and $y$ we write $x \subseteq y$, and say that $x$ is a **subset**
of $y$ or that $x$ is **included** in $y$, for the formula
$\forall t\,(t \in x \to t \in y)$ of the language of set theory
([[def-language-of-set-theory]]); thus $x \subseteq y$ means that every element
of $x$ is an element of $y$. We also write $y \supseteq x$ for $x \subseteq y$.

$x$ is a **proper subset** of $y$, written $x \subsetneq y$, when $x \subseteq y$
and $x \neq y$.

**Separation notation.** Let $x$ be a set, $\varphi(z,\bar p)$ a formula and
$\bar p$ parameters. [[def-axiom-schema-of-separation]] supplies a set whose
elements are exactly the elements $z$ of $x$ for which $\varphi(z,\bar p)$ holds,
and [[def-axiom-of-extensionality]] shows there is only one such set. It is
written

$$\{\, z \in x : \varphi(z,\bar p) \,\}$$

and every set introduced on this page by separating a condition inside a set
already in hand is written this way. Directly from the definition,
$\{\, z \in x : \varphi(z,\bar p) \,\} \subseteq x$.

## Remarks

- **$\subset$ is not used in this library.** Sources disagree about it: some write
  $\subset$ for inclusion and some for proper inclusion, so a formula containing
  it cannot be read without knowing which convention its author used.
  $\subseteq$ and $\subsetneq$ are unambiguous and are the only two symbols used
  here.

- **Membership and inclusion are different relations.** $t \in x$ says $t$ is one
  of the elements of $x$; $t \subseteq x$ says every element of $t$ is an element
  of $x$. Neither implies the other in general, and
  [[prop-basic-properties-of-the-power-set]] is where the two are systematically
  related.
