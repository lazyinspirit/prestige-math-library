You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as
an independent adversarial proof-refuter. Return evidence only; Audit-Alpha
alone adjudicates and edits.

## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` Statement or consumer, actively search for a
counterexample or a failure in the witness or cited generated premise. A false
public claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or
materially inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is
nonfatal.

Return no more than 450 words, exactly in this shape:

For each defect:

```text
FINDING 1
  location: [exact section/fact/step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [exact assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]
```

Always end with:

```text
BOUNDARY: [specific boundary/counterexample checks and disposition]
SOURCES:  [confirm every supplied cited item used by the target was inspected]
CHECKED:  [confirm title, public claim, every numbered step, and Remarks]

## Statement

Let $m\ge1$, let $Q\subseteq\mathbb R^m$ be a closed nondegenerate rectangle, and let $f:Q\to\mathbb R$ be continuous. Its graph has content zero in $\mathbb R^{m+1}$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $Q,f$ as stated.

[L1] $Q$ is compact and $f$ uniformly continuous ([[thm-heine-borel-rn]], [[thm-heine-cantor-metric]], [[def-metric-continuity]]).

[L2] Grid cells and cube volumes are [[def-multidimensional-grid-partition]] and [[def-multidimensional-rectangle-and-volume]].

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 Given $\varepsilon>0$, choose a uniform coordinate grid with cell widths at most $\delta$, where uniform continuity makes the oscillation of $f$ on each cell below a vertical amount $\eta$. Since $Q$ is nondegenerate, the grid may be chosen so that the number $N_\delta$ of cells satisfies $N_\delta\delta^m\le C_Q$ for a constant depending only on $Q$. [L1, L2, given, choose, construct]

2.1 One horizontal cube footprint of side $\delta$ covers each domain cell. Above it, stack $(m+1)$-cubes of side $\delta$ across the graph's vertical range. [[lem-integer-part]] bounds their number by $\eta/\delta+2$, so all stacks together have volume at most $N_\delta(\eta\delta^m+2\delta^{m+1})\le C_Q(\eta+2\delta)$. [step 1.1, L2, given]

3.1 Summing over the finitely many domain cells gives total covering volume at most a rectangle-dependent constant times $\eta+\delta$. Choose $\eta$ and then $\delta$ to make this below $\varepsilon$.   [step 2.1, given, choose]

4.1 This finite cube cover proves content zero in the sense of [[def-null-and-content-zero-in-rn]].  [step 3.1, discharge-construct] ∎

## Definition

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]) with additive identity $0_F$ and
multiplicative identity $1_F$. Define
$\iota : \mathbb{N} \to F$ by recursion on $\mathbb{N}$
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[thm-recursion]]):

$$\iota(0) \;:=\; 0_F, \qquad \iota(n+1) \;:=\; \iota(n) + 1_F .$$

$\iota(n)$ is the **canonical natural** of $n$ in $F$. It is also written
$n \cdot 1_F$, and for $n \ge 1$ it is $1_F$ added to itself $n$ times.

**Why the notation is needed at all.** A natural number in this library is a von
Neumann natural, that is a set ([[def-natural-numbers]]), and a set is not an
element of $F$. So $1/n$, $n^{\alpha}$ and $x/n$ are not expressions of $F$ when
$n$ is a natural: what they mean is $1/\iota(n)$, $\iota(n)^{\alpha}$ and
$x/\iota(n)$. The map $\iota$ is what carries a counting number into the field,
and writing it is the whole reason a reader meets $1/\iota(k+1)$ where an
informal text would write $1/(k+1)$.

## Remarks

- **Where the index shift comes from.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
  ([[def-natural-numbers]]) and $\iota(0) = 0_F$, so $1/\iota(k)$ is undefined at
  $k = 0$. A family of reciprocals indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ is therefore written
  over $\iota(k+1)$, which is why the harmonic and telescoping families of this
  library run over $k+1$ rather than over $k$. This is bookkeeping, not a
  restriction: the values are the usual ones.

- **This definition records notation; the arithmetic is proved elsewhere.** That
  $\iota$ is strictly increasing and positive on $n \ge 1$, and that it carries
  sums to sums and products to products, is [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], stated
  for an ordered field. That lemma introduces the same element by the equivalent
  recursion $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, which
  agrees with the definition above because $\iota(1) = \iota(0) + 1_F = 1_F$.
  Nothing here is new mathematics; the definition exists so that the notation has
  a home a reader can look up.

- **The symbol $\iota$ is used in this library for other canonical maps, and this
  definition does not govern them.** It also denotes the canonical field
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to F$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), the isometric
  embedding of a metric space into a completion ([[def-metric-completion]]), and
  an inclusion map $\iota : S \to X$ of a subspace. Each of those is introduced
  where it is used and means something different from the map defined here. What
  the four share is only that each is the canonical map of its situation.

- **Fields, not just ordered fields.** The recursion needs no order, so the
  definition is stated for a field; every use in this library is in an ordered
  field, and the order is what makes $\iota$ injective
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). In a field of positive characteristic $\iota$
  is not injective, which is one reason the injectivity is a lemma rather than
  part of the definition.

## Definition

Let $(X, d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$ be metric spaces ([[def-metric-space]]), let
$f : X \to Y$ be a function and let $a \in X$.

$f$ is **continuous at $a$** if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ such that

$$d_X(x,a) < \delta \;\Longrightarrow\; d_Y\big(f(x), f(a)\big) < \varepsilon \qquad \text{for all } x \in X .$$

$f$ is **continuous** (globally, or on $X$) if it is continuous at every point of
$X$.

**The same condition in balls.** Since $d_X(x,a) < \delta$ says $x \in B_X(a,\delta)$
and $d_Y(f(x),f(a)) < \varepsilon$ says $f(x) \in B_Y(f(a),\varepsilon)$
([[def-metric-ball]]), continuity at $a$ reads: for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there
is $\delta > 0$ with

$$f\big[B_X(a,\delta)\big] \subseteq B_Y\big(f(a), \varepsilon\big).$$

Both forms are used below and are the same statement written twice.

**Both metrics matter, and both are named.** Continuity is a property of the
triple $(d_X, d_Y, f)$, not of $f$ alone. When several metrics on the same
underlying sets are in play, as in [[def-equivalent-metrics]], the metrics are
always written out.

**Quantifier order.** The $\delta$ is allowed to depend on $\varepsilon$ **and on
the point $a$**. Requiring one $\delta$ to work at every point simultaneously is
a strictly stronger condition, uniform continuity; it is defined on a later page
of this library, and at this point in the reading order it is written out in full
where needed ([[def-equivalent-metrics]]).

## Remarks

- **Nothing is claimed here beyond the definition.** That continuity is
  equivalent to preimages of open sets being open, to preimages of closed sets
  being closed, to sequential continuity, and to
  $f[\overline{A}] \subseteq \overline{f[A]}$, is the theorem
  [[thm-metric-continuity-characterisations]].
- **Continuity at a point is a local condition**: it depends only on the values
  of $f$ on any one ball around $a$, since the condition may always be tested
  with a smaller $\delta$.
- Every isometric embedding is continuous, with $\delta = \varepsilon$
  ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]], [[lem-isometry-is-an-embedding]]), and
  so is every map that does not increase distances, such as $u \mapsto d(u,A)$
  ([[lem-distance-to-set-is-lipschitz]]).

## Definition

A **grid partition** $P$ of a nondegenerate rectangle $Q=[a,b]\subseteq\mathbb R^m$ is a family, one for each $j<m$, of one-dimensional partitions $a_j=t_{j,0}<\cdots<t_{j,n_j}=b_j$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]). For a multi-index $i=(i_0,\ldots,i_{m-1})$ with $i_j<n_j$, its cell is
$$Q_i:=\prod_{j<m}[t_{j,i_j},t_{j,i_j+1}].$$
A sum over cells means the iterated recursive sum $\sum_{i_0<n_0}\cdots\sum_{i_{m-1}<n_{m-1}}$ of [[def-finite-sum]]. The **mesh** is $\max_{j<m,i_j<n_j}(t_{j,i_j+1}-t_{j,i_j})$, which exists by [[lem-finite-set-has-max]] and is the largest $d_\infty$-diameter ([[def-p-norms-on-rn]], [[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]]).

Refinement is coordinatewise. Coordinatewise union gives a common refinement. The cells cover $Q$ and have pairwise disjoint interiors. Repeated splitting of finite sums and induction on $m$ give
$$\sum_i\operatorname{vol}(Q_i)=\operatorname{vol}(Q).$$
These statements include boundary overlaps: boundaries may meet, but interiors do not, and volume splitting is algebraic.

## Definition

Fix a natural number $m\ge1$. For $a,b\in\mathbb R^m$ with $a_j\le b_j$ for $j<m$, define
$$[a,b]:=\{x\in\mathbb R^m:a_j\le x_j\le b_j\ (j<m)\},\qquad \operatorname{vol}[a,b]:=\prod_{j<m}(b_j-a_j).$$
The product is the recursively defined finite product of [[def-finite-sum]]. The rectangle is **nondegenerate** when every $a_j<b_j$, and it is a **cube** when all side lengths are equal.

Every factor is nonnegative, so volume is nonnegative. For a coordinate index $r<m$, cutting at $c\in[a_r,b_r]$ gives two rectangles whose volumes add to the original, by distributivity in that factor and [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]. Under the standard identification $\mathbb R^1\cong\mathbb R$ ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]], [[def-p-norms-on-rn]]), this is the interval $[a_0,b_0]$ and its length.

## Definition

Fix $m\ge1$. A **closed cube** is a rectangle $\prod_{j<m}[a_j,a_j+\ell]$ with $\ell\ge0$; its volume is $\ell^m$. A set $E\subseteq\mathbb R^m$ is **null** when, for every $\varepsilon>0$, it is covered by a sequence of closed cubes whose nonnegative volume series converges with sum at most $\varepsilon$. It has **content zero** when such a cover can be finite.

The series and finite sums are [[def-series]] and [[def-finite-sum]], and their nonnegative bounds use [[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]] and [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]. Both properties pass to subsets. Padding a finite cover with degenerate zero-volume cubes proves that content zero implies null. This terminology defines only cover-nullity; it does not define a measure on arbitrary sets.

## Statement

Let $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be sequences of reals, let
$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, and let $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, with finite sums and
finite products as in [[def-finite-sum]]. Then:

1. **Additivity.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k$.
2. **Scaling.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k$; in particular $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda = n\lambda$, where $n$ denotes the canonical natural $\iota(n) \in \mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).
3. **Splitting.** If $m \le n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k$, and $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n} a_k = \Big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k\Big)$.
4. **Monotonicity.** If $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$. In particular, if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, every single term satisfies $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$ for $j < n$, and $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ forces $a_k = 0$ for every $k < n$.
5. **Telescoping.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}\big(c_{k+1} - c_k\big) = c_n - c_0$.
6. **Products.** $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k) = \Big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\Big)$; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, and if $a_k > 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k > 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\lambda$, and naturals $m, n$. Write $\Sigma_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\Pi_n = \prod_{k<n} a_k$.

[L1] Recursion clauses ([[def-finite-sum]]): $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ and $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n$; $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1$ and $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) \cdot a_n$; and $\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k = \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j}$ for $m \le n$, likewise for products.

[L2] Field axioms: addition and multiplication are associative and commutative, $0$ and $1$ are the identities, $x - x = 0$, and multiplication distributes over addition ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]); and $0 \cdot x = 0$, which is not an axiom but a lemma ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

[L3] Induction principle: a property holding at $0$ and inherited by successors holds at every natural ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L4] Adding inequalities: $x \le y$ and $u \le v$ imply $x + u \le y + v$. [[lem-of-add-order]] states the STRICT forms and only those ($x < y \Rightarrow x + c < y + c$, and $x < y$ with $u < v$ giving $x + u < y + v$); the nonstrict form used throughout below is those two together with the cases $x = y$ and $u = v$, which are settled by trichotomy, the order being total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] The canonical embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a field homomorphism, so $\iota(0) = 0$ and $\iota(n+1) = \iota(n) + 1$, and $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L6] Sign rules: a product of two positives is positive ([[lem-of-sign-rules]], claim 1), and a product of two nonnegatives is nonnegative, since a factor equal to $0$ makes the product $0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]) and otherwise both factors are positive; and $1 > 0$, which is proved in [[cor-of-one-positive]] and stated by none of the items named above.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 0$: every claim holds at $n = 0$, since both sides of claim 1 are $0 = 0 + 0$, both sides of claim 2 are $0 = \lambda \cdot 0$ and $0 = \iota(0)\lambda$, claim 4 reads $0 \le 0$ with no term to bound and the hypothesis $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ giving nothing to prove, claim 5 reads $0 = c_0 - c_0$, and claim 6 reads $1 = 1 \cdot 1$ with $1 > 0$. [base, L1, L2, L5, L6]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for this $n$ and for all sequences $a, b, c$ and all $\lambda$. [ih]

1.3 Splitting, claim 3, by a separate induction on the number of trailing terms $d = n - m$ with $m$ fixed: for $d = 0$ the claim reads $\sum_{k<m} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + 0$ and $\prod_{k<m} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\big) \cdot 1$, which hold; and if $\sum_{k<m+d} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d} a_{m+j}$, then $\sum_{k<m+d+1} a_k = \sum_{k<m+d} a_k + a_{m+d} = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \big(\sum_{j<d} a_{m+j} + a_{m+d}\big) = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d+1} a_{m+j}$ by associativity, and identically for products with $1$ in place of $0$ and multiplication in place of addition, so induction on $d$ gives claim 3 for every $m \le n$. [L1, L2, L3]

2.1 Additivity at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k\big) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) + \big(\sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n\big) = \sum_{k<n+1} a_k + \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$, using the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of addition. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Scaling at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda a_k = \sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda\big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) = \lambda \sum_{k<n+1} a_k$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and distributivity; taking $a_k = 1$ for all $k$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda = \sum_{k<n} \lambda + \lambda = \iota(n)\lambda + \lambda = (\iota(n) + 1)\lambda = \iota(n+1)\lambda$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L5]

2.3 Monotonicity at $n+1$: assume $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n+1$; then $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$, so the hypothesis gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$, and adding the inequality $a_n \le b_n$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n \le \sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n = \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$. [step 1.2, L1, L4]

2.4 Telescoping at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(c_{k+1} - c_k) = \sum_{k<n}(c_{k+1} - c_k) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = (c_n - c_0) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = c_{n+1} - c_0$, by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and the field identities. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.5 Products at $n+1$: $\prod_{k<n+1}(a_k b_k) = \big(\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k)\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n+1} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n+1} b_k\big)$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of multiplication; and if every $a_k \ge 0$ for $k < n+1$ then $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) a_n$ is a product of two nonnegatives, hence nonnegative, with the same argument giving positivity from positivity since $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1 > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L6]

3.1 Consequences of monotonicity, completing claim 4: monotonicity itself holds at every $n$, by the induction principle applied to the base case of step 1.1 and the successor step 2.3, so it is available for an arbitrary $n$ in what follows; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then comparing with the zero sequence gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge \sum_{k<n} 0 = 0$; for $j < n$ splitting at $j$ and then at $j+1$ writes $\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<j} a_k + a_j + \sum_{k=j+1}^{n-1} a_k$ with the first and third summands $\ge 0$, so $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$; and if moreover $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ then $0 \le a_j \le 0$ for every $j < n$, so $a_j = 0$. [step 1.1, step 2.3, step 1.3, L3, L4, L2]

4.1 By the induction principle claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and claim 3 was proved in step 1.3 with its consequences in step 3.1, so all six laws hold. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, step 2.5, step 1.3, step 3.1, L3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Identify $\mathbb{Z}$ with its canonical copy inside $\mathbb{R}$, along the
embeddings $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$
([[lem-nat-embeds-int]], [[lem-int-embeds-rat]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]],
[[def-integers]]). Then for every real $x$ there is **exactly one** integer $m$
with

$$m \;\le\; x \;<\; m + 1 .$$

It is written $\lfloor x \rfloor$ and called the **integer part**, or **floor**,
of $x$.

**Two independent ingredients are needed and neither may be dropped.** Existence
is the Archimedean property ([[thm-of-archimedean]]) together with the
well-ordering of $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]): the first says
that $x$ is caught between two integers at all, the second picks the *least*
integer above $x$. Uniqueness is the discreteness of $\mathbb{Z}$: no integer
lies strictly between $m$ and $m+1$.

This lemma is stated once here and reused. It is what turns "the nearest integer
to $x$" from a picture into an object, and the companion page's oscillator
$\psi(x) = \inf_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} |x - n|$ is computed from it in one line.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real $x$. Naturals, integers and rationals are identified with their canonical copies in $\mathbb{R}$ along $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] The embeddings $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$ are injective and preserve $0$, $1$, addition, multiplication and order ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]], [[lem-int-embeds-rat]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]], [[def-integers]]); $\mathbb{Z}$ is a totally ordered commutative ring ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]], [[thm-int-comm-ring]]); every integer $\ge 0$ is the image of a unique natural, that map being injective and order preserving ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]); and a natural $j \ne 0$ satisfies $j \ge 1$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]], [[def-natural-numbers]]).

[L2] The image of a natural $n \ge 1$ under the composite $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ is the canonical natural $n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ of [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]. Indeed that composite preserves $1$ and addition by [L1], while $n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ is defined by $1 \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} = 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} = n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} + 1_{\mathbb{R}}$, so the two agree at $1$ and satisfy the same recursion; induction on $n$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]) gives the identification.

[L3] Archimedean property: for every real $t$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $t < n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L4] Well-ordering principle: every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L5] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: the order is total, so the negation of $t < u$ is $u \le t$; trichotomy, so $t < u$ and $u \le t$ cannot both hold; translation invariance ([[lem-of-add-order]]); $t \le |t|$ and $-t \le |t|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]); and transitivity ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 Apply [L3] to the real $|x|$: fix a natural $n \ge 1$ with $|x| < n$. Since $x \le |x|$ and $-x \le |x|$, this gives $-n < x < n$. [L2, L3, L5, choose]

2.1 Put $S := \{\, k \in \mathbb{N} \ : \ x < k - n \,\}$, where $k - n$ is formed in $\mathbb{Z}$ and read in $\mathbb{R}$ through [L1]. It is a subset of $\mathbb{N}$, and it is nonempty: the natural $2n$ satisfies $2n - n = n > x$ by step 1.1, so $2n \in S$. [step 1.1, L1, L2, construct]

3.1 By the well-ordering principle [L4] let $k_0$ be the least element of $S$. [step 2.1, L4, choose]

4.1 The index $k_0$ is not $0$: for $k = 0$ the defining condition reads $x < 0 - n = -n$, which trichotomy excludes since $-n < x$ by step 1.1. Hence $k_0 \ne 0$, so $k_0 \ge 1$ by [L1], and $k_0 - 1$ is again a natural number. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L1, L5]

5.1 Set $m := (k_0 - 1) - n$, an integer. Since $k_0 - 1 < k_0$ and $k_0$ is the least element of $S$, the natural $k_0 - 1$ does not lie in $S$, that is, $x < (k_0 - 1) - n$ fails; the order being total, $m = (k_0 - 1) - n \le x$. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L1, L5, construct]

6.1 On the other hand $k_0 \in S$ gives $x < k_0 - n = \bigl((k_0 - 1) - n\bigr) + 1 = m + 1$. So $m \le x < m + 1$, and existence is proved. [step 3.1, step 5.1, L1, L5]

7.1 Uniqueness: suppose an integer $m'$ also satisfies $m' \le x < m' + 1$ and $m' \ne m$. The order of $\mathbb{Z}$ being total, one of $m < m'$ and $m' < m$ holds, and the two cases are the same with the roles of $m$ and $m'$ exchanged; so assume $m < m'$. Then $m' - m$ is an integer $> 0$, hence by [L1] the image of a natural $j \ne 0$, so $j \ge 1$ and $m' - m \ge 1$, that is $m + 1 \le m'$. But then $x < m + 1 \le m' \le x$, which trichotomy forbids. Hence $m' = m$. [step 6.1, L1, L5]

8.1 Therefore exactly one integer $m$ satisfies $m \le x < m + 1$, and we write $m = \lfloor x \rfloor$. [step 6.1, step 7.1, discharge-construct] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the two halves of the proof really use.** Step 1.1 is the only use of the Archimedean property, and it is indispensable: in a non-Archimedean ordered field ([[cex-ordered-field-not-archimedean]]) an element larger than every canonical natural has no integer part at all, since the set $S$ of step 2.1 would be empty. Step 3.1 is the only use of the well-ordering principle, and it is what makes the construction canonical: no choice is made anywhere, and $\lfloor x \rfloor$ is a function of $x$.

- **Immediate consequences, used later.** From $m \le x < m + 1$ one reads off $0 \le x - m < 1$ and $0 < (m+1) - x \le 1$; and $\lfloor x \rfloor = x$ exactly when $x$ is an integer, since an integer $m$ satisfies $m \le m < m + 1$ and uniqueness does the rest. The translation identity $\lfloor x + p \rfloor = \lfloor x \rfloor + p$ for an integer $p$ follows the same way: adding $p$ to $m \le x < m+1$ gives $m + p \le x + p < (m + p) + 1$, and uniqueness identifies $m + p$ as the integer part of $x + p$.

- **The ceiling is not defined here** and is not needed on this page; it would be the least integer $\ge x$, obtained from the same set $S$ without the shift by one.

## Statement

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $p \in \mathbb{Q}$ with $p \ge 1$, with the norms
of [[def-p-norms-on-rn]]. Then:

1. $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$ is a norm on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
   ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]).
2. For $n \ge 1$, $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ is a norm on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
3. **The dictionary.** For $n \ge 1$ and all $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$,
   $$\lVert x-y\rVert_1 = d_1(x,y), \qquad \lVert x-y\rVert_2 = d_2(x,y), \qquad \lVert x-y\rVert_\infty = d_\infty(x,y),$$
   where $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_\infty$ are the metrics of the published
   [[lem-metrics-on-rn]]. So the metric induced by each of these three norms
   ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]) **is** the correspondingly named published
   metric, not merely one equivalent to it.

**Consequence, used repeatedly below and stated once here.** By clause 3 at
$p = 2$, the metric space $(\mathbb{R}^{n}, d_2)$ of the published metric-spaces
page and the metric space underlying the normed space
$(\mathbb{R}^{n}, \lVert\cdot\rVert_2)$ of this page are the same object. Hence
completeness ([[thm-euclidean-space-complete]] clause 2), Heine-Borel
([[thm-heine-borel-rn]] clause 2) and the compactness equivalences
([[thm-metric-compactness-equivalences]]) are statements about this page's normed
space, **with their hypothesis $n \ge 1$ inherited unchanged and not weakened**.
Nothing below cites any of those three theorems for $n = 0$.

**Why this lemma exists.** Without it the library would hold a norm-induced
metric on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and a separately published metric on the same set with
no recorded relation, and every later citation would have to guess which was
meant. The proof of clause 3 is a comparison of two written expressions; the
value is that the comparison is made and recorded.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural number $n$, a rational $p \ge 1$, vectors $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ and a real $\lambda$; write $S(x) := \sum_{k<n}|x_k|^{p}$, so that $\lVert x\rVert_p = S(x)^{1/p}$ ([[def-p-norms-on-rn]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[A1] For clauses 2 and 3, $n \ge 1$, so that $\{|x_k| : k<n\}$ is a nonempty finite set of reals ([[def-p-norms-on-rn]], [[lem-metrics-on-rn]]).

[L1] Rational powers ([[def-rational-power]], [[lem-rational-power-laws]]): for $a, b \ge 0$ and rationals $r, s > 0$ one has $a^{r} \ge 0$, $(ab)^{r} = a^{r}b^{r}$, $0^{r} = 0$, and $a^{r} > 0$ when $a > 0$; and for $a > 0$, $(a^{r})^{s} = a^{rs}$ and $a^{1} = a$.

[L2] Monotonicity in the base ([[lem-rational-power-monotone]] clause 2): for a rational $r > 0$ and reals $0 \le a < b$ one has $a^{r} < b^{r}$; hence $a \le b$ implies $a^{r} \le b^{r}$, the case $a = b$ being trivial, and $a^{r} = 0$ only for $a = 0$.

[L3] Laws of finite sums ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[def-finite-sum]]): additivity, scaling, monotonicity; a sum of nonnegative terms is nonnegative, each single term is at most such a sum, and a sum of nonnegative terms that vanishes has every term $0$.

[L4] Minkowski's inequality for finite sums at rational $p \ge 1$ ([[thm-minkowski-finite]]): $\bigl(\sum_{k<n}|a_k+b_k|^{p}\bigr)^{1/p} \le \bigl(\sum_{k<n}|a_k|^{p}\bigr)^{1/p} + \bigl(\sum_{k<n}|b_k|^{p}\bigr)^{1/p}$.

[L5] Absolute value ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]], [[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]): $|t| \ge 0$; $|t| = 0$ exactly when $t = 0$; $|st| = |s|\,|t|$; $|s+t| \le |s|+|t|$; and $|t|^{2} = t^{2}$.

[L6] Maxima ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]): a nonempty finite set of reals has a maximum, the maximum belongs to the set and bounds it above, and a set with an upper bound belonging to it has that element as its maximum.

[L7] Order arithmetic: multiplying an inequality by a nonnegative real preserves it ([[lem-of-sign-rules]] in its strict form, together with the case of equality settled by totality), and $\le$ is transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L8] The norm axioms (N1), (N2), (N3) ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]); $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ agrees with the Euclidean norm of [[def-euclidean-inner-product]], and is a norm by [[thm-cauchy-schwarz-and-the-euclidean-norm]]; square roots are the rational power at exponent $1/2$ ([[thm-of-square-roots]], [[def-p-norms-on-rn]]).

[L9] The published metrics on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n \ge 1$ are $d_1(x,y) = \sum_{k<n}|x_k-y_k|$, $d_2(x,y) = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}(x_k-y_k)^{2}}$ and $d_\infty(x,y) = \max\{|x_k-y_k| : k<n\}$, and each is a metric ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]], [[def-metric-space]], [[def-metric-topology]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Every term $|x_k|^{p}$ is nonnegative, so $S(x) \ge 0$ and $\lVert x\rVert_p = S(x)^{1/p}$ is defined and nonnegative. [L1, L3]

1.2 $S(x) = 0$ holds exactly when $|x_k|^{p} = 0$ for every $k<n$, a vanishing sum of nonnegative terms having every term $0$; and $|x_k|^{p} = 0$ exactly when $|x_k| = 0$, that is exactly when $x_k = 0$. [L1, L2, L3, L5]

1.3 For every $k<n$, $|(\lambda x)_k|^{p} = \bigl(|\lambda|\,|x_k|\bigr)^{p} = |\lambda|^{p}|x_k|^{p}$, so $S(\lambda x) = |\lambda|^{p}S(x)$ by scaling of finite sums. [L1, L3, L5]

1.4 Instantiating [L4] at $a_k := x_k$ and $b_k := y_k$, and using $(x+y)_k = x_k+y_k$, gives $\lVert x+y\rVert_p \le \lVert x\rVert_p + \lVert y\rVert_p$, which is axiom (N3) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$. [L4, L8]

1.5 Under [A1] the set $\{|x_k| : k<n\}$ is nonempty and finite, so $\lVert x\rVert_\infty$ exists, is one of the $|x_k|$, and satisfies $|x_k| \le \lVert x\rVert_\infty$ for every $k<n$; in particular $\lVert x\rVert_\infty \ge 0$. [A1, L5, L6]

1.6 Under [A1], $\lVert x-y\rVert_1 = \sum_{k<n}|x_k-y_k|$ by the case $p=1$ of the definition, and that is the written expression for $d_1(x,y)$. [L1, L9]

1.7 Under [A1], $\lVert x-y\rVert_2 = \bigl(\sum_{k<n}|x_k-y_k|^{2}\bigr)^{1/2} = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}(x_k-y_k)^{2}}$, using $|t|^{2} = t^{2}$ and the identification of the exponent $1/2$ with the nonnegative square root, and that is the written expression for $d_2(x,y)$. [L5, L8, L9]

1.8 Under [A1], $\lVert x-y\rVert_\infty = \max\{|x_k-y_k| : k<n\}$ by definition, and that is the written expression for $d_\infty(x,y)$. [L9]

2.1 $\lVert x\rVert_p = 0$ holds exactly when $S(x) = 0$, since $S(x) > 0$ would give $S(x)^{1/p} > 0$ and $0^{1/p} = 0$. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.2 Under [A1]: $\lVert x\rVert_\infty = 0$ forces $|x_k| \le 0$ and $|x_k| \ge 0$ for every $k<n$, hence $x = 0$; and $\lVert 0\rVert_\infty = 0$. This is (N1) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$. [step 1.5, L5, L8]

2.3 Under [A1]: for every $k<n$, $|(\lambda x)_k| = |\lambda|\,|x_k| \le |\lambda|\,\lVert x\rVert_\infty$, and choosing $j<n$ with $|x_j| = \lVert x\rVert_\infty$ gives $|(\lambda x)_j| = |\lambda|\,\lVert x\rVert_\infty$; so $|\lambda|\lVert x\rVert_\infty$ belongs to the set and bounds it above, whence $\lVert \lambda x\rVert_\infty = |\lambda|\lVert x\rVert_\infty$. This is (N2) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$. [step 1.5, L5, L6, L7]

2.4 Under [A1]: for every $k<n$, $|(x+y)_k| = |x_k+y_k| \le |x_k| + |y_k| \le \lVert x\rVert_\infty + \lVert y\rVert_\infty$; choosing $j<n$ with $|(x+y)_j| = \lVert x+y\rVert_\infty$ gives $\lVert x+y\rVert_\infty \le \lVert x\rVert_\infty + \lVert y\rVert_\infty$, which is (N3) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$. [step 1.5, L5, L6, L7]

3.1 By steps 2.1 and 1.2, $\lVert x\rVert_p = 0$ exactly when $x_k = 0$ for every $k<n$, that is exactly when $x = 0$; this is axiom (N1) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$. [step 2.1, step 1.2, L8]

3.2 Steps 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 are (N1), (N2) and (N3) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ under [A1], so clause 2 holds. [step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, A1, L8]

4.1 If $\lambda = 0$ then $\lambda x = 0$ and both sides of (N2) are $0$ by step 3.1; if $\lambda \ne 0$ then $|\lambda| > 0$, and step 1.3 with the power laws gives $\lVert \lambda x\rVert_p = \bigl(|\lambda|^{p}S(x)\bigr)^{1/p} = \bigl(|\lambda|^{p}\bigr)^{1/p}S(x)^{1/p} = |\lambda|^{p\cdot(1/p)}\lVert x\rVert_p = |\lambda|\,\lVert x\rVert_p$; this is axiom (N2). [step 1.3, step 3.1, L1, L5, L8]

5.1 Steps 3.1, 4.1 and 1.4 are (N1), (N2) and (N3) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$, so clause 1 holds. [step 1.4, step 3.1, step 4.1, L8]

6.1 Steps 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8 give clause 3, and with steps 5.1 and 3.2 all three clauses are proved; in particular the metric induced by $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n \ge 1$ is the published $d_2$, which is the consequence recorded in the Statement. [step 5.1, step 3.2, step 1.6, step 1.7, step 1.8, L9] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the consequence does and does not license.** Because the two metric spaces are literally the same, a published theorem about $(\mathbb{R}^{n}, d_2)$ may be quoted here verbatim. It may **not** be quoted with a weaker hypothesis: [[thm-euclidean-space-complete]], [[thm-heine-borel-rn]] and [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] are all stated for $n \ge 1$ only, because $d_\infty$ is a maximum over an empty index set at $n = 0$, and every item on this page that uses one of them carries $n \ge 1$ in its own statement.

- **Clause 1 holds at $n = 0$ and clause 2 does not apply there.** At $n = 0$ every $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$ is the zero function on the one-element space $\mathbb{R}^{0}$, which is the unique norm on the zero space ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]); $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ is not defined there at all.

- **The route to (N3) differs between the two families, and that is not an accident.** For $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$ the triangle inequality is Minkowski's inequality, a genuine theorem about rational powers; for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ it is the elementary argument of step 2.4, that a maximum of sums is at most the sum of the maxima. The second argument is the one that needs a nonempty index set.

## Statement

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, let $\mathbb{R}^n$ be the set of functions
$n \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $d_2$ be the Euclidean metric on it
([[lem-metrics-on-rn]]). Then:

1. **Closed boxes are compact.** For reals $a_k \le b_k$ $(k < n)$ the box
   $Q = \{\, x \in \mathbb{R}^n : a_k \le x_k \le b_k \text{ for every } k < n \,\}$
   is a compact subset of $(\mathbb{R}^n, d_2)$ ([[def-metric-compactness]]).
2. **Heine-Borel.** A subset $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is a compact subset of
   $(\mathbb{R}^n, d_2)$ if and only if $K$ is closed in $\mathbb{R}^n$
   ([[def-metric-topology]]) and bounded
   ([[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]).
3. **The real line.** A subset $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a compact subset of
   $(\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$, the usual metric $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) = |x-y|$
   ([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]), if and only if $K$ is closed in
   $\mathbb{R}$ and bounded.

**No choice principle is used.** The bisection below halves one coordinate at a
time and takes the **left** half whenever the left half still fails to be finitely
covered, the right half otherwise: a rule with two outcomes, decided by a
property of the box, not a selection. That is the whole reason the theorem is
available in ZF, while the general "complete and totally bounded implies compact"
([[thm-complete-and-totally-bounded-implies-compact]]) is not.

The hypothesis $n \ge 1$ is inherited from [[lem-metrics-on-rn]], which defines
$\mathbb{R}^n$ and its metrics only there; the last remark below records what
happens at $n = 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural number $n \ge 1$, the metric space $(\mathbb{R}^n, d_2)$, and the notions of open, closed, bounded and compact subset in it.

[L1] $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the set of functions $n \to \mathbb{R}$, and $d_2(x,y) = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}(x_k-y_k)^2}$, $d_\infty(x,y) = \max\{|x_k - y_k| : k < n\}$ are metrics on it ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]], [[def-finite-sum]], [[def-metric-space]]).

[L2] Finite sums of nonnegative terms dominate each term and are monotone, and $\sum_{k<n} c = \iota(n)c$ for a constant $c$, $\iota(n)$ being the canonical natural of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[def-finite-sum]], [[def-canonical-natural]]).

[L3] For $a,b \ge 0$: $a \le b$ exactly when $a^2 \le b^2$; every $a \ge 0$ has a unique nonnegative square root; and $\sqrt{c^2} = |c|$ for every real $c$ ([[lem-of-square-monotone]], [[thm-of-square-roots]], [[def-abs-value]]).

[L4] A subset $A$ is compact exactly when every family $(U_i)_{i \in I}$ of open subsets of the ambient space with $A \subseteq \bigcup_{i \in I} U_i$ has finitely many members whose union contains $A$, or $A = \emptyset$; and the sets open in the subspace $A$ are exactly the traces on $A$ of the open subsets of the ambient space, so, taking complements inside $A$, the sets closed in $A$ are exactly the traces on $A$ of the closed subsets of the ambient space ([[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]], [[def-metric-compactness]], [[def-metric-topology]], [[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]).

[L5] A compact subset of a metric space is closed and bounded ([[thm-compact-subset-is-closed-and-bounded]]).

[L6] A closed subset of a compact metric space is compact ([[lem-closed-subset-of-a-compact-space-is-compact]]).

[L7] Nested closed bounded intervals $I_m = [\alpha_m,\beta_m]$ with $I_{m+1} \subseteq I_m$ have nonempty intersection, and the intersection is a single point exactly when the lengths tend to $0$ ([[thm-nested-interval-property]], [[def-interval]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L8] Recursion: for a set $A$, an element $a \in A$ and $f : A \to A$ there is a unique $g : \mathbb{N} \to A$ with $g(0) = a$ and $g(m+1) = f(g(m))$; a stage-dependent rule is handled on $A = \mathbb{N} \times Z$, the first coordinate of $g(m)$ then being $m$ ([[thm-recursion]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[L9] $(1/2)^m \to 0$, integer powers being those of [[def-integer-power]] ([[lem-geometric-sequence-null]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L10] A nonempty finite set of reals has a maximum, one of its members ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L11] $U$ is open exactly when every point of $U$ has a ball inside $U$; a subset is bounded when it is empty or lies in some ball $B(x_0,\rho)$ with $\rho > 0$ ([[def-metric-topology]], [[def-metric-ball]], [[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]).

[L12] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/N < \eta$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For $x,y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $k < n$ the term $(x_k-y_k)^2$ is one of the nonnegative terms of $\sum_{j<n}(x_j-y_j)^2$, so $(x_k-y_k)^2 \le d_2(x,y)^2$, and taking nonnegative square roots gives $|x_k - y_k| \le d_2(x,y)$; hence $d_\infty(x,y) \le d_2(x,y)$. [L1, L2, L3]

1.2 Conversely each $(x_j-y_j)^2 \le d_\infty(x,y)^2$, so $d_2(x,y)^2 \le \iota(n)\,d_\infty(x,y)^2 \le \big(\iota(n) d_\infty(x,y)\big)^2$, the last step because $\iota(n) \ge 1$; hence $d_2(x,y) \le \iota(n)\, d_\infty(x,y)$. [L1, L2, L3]

2.1 For claim 1 fix reals $a_k \le b_k$ $(k<n)$ and the box $Q$ they determine, let $(U_i)_{i \in I}$ be open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with $Q \subseteq \bigcup_{i \in I} U_i$, call a set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ **finitely covered** when finitely many of the $U_i$ have union containing $S$, and suppose for contradiction that $Q$ is not finitely covered. [L4, step 1.1, step 1.2, assume-contra]

3.1 For a box $P = \{\, x : c_j \le x_j \le e_j \ (j<n) \,\}$ with $c_j \le e_j$ and for $k < n$, let $P^{k,0}$ and $P^{k,1}$ be the boxes obtained by replacing the $k$-th interval $[c_k,e_k]$ by $[c_k, (c_k+e_k)/2]$ and by $[(c_k+e_k)/2, e_k]$; then $P = P^{k,0} \cup P^{k,1}$ by trichotomy applied to $x_k$ against the midpoint, the $k$-th side length of each is $(e_k-c_k)/2$ and the others are unchanged, and if both halves were finitely covered so would $P$ be, the union of two finite subfamilies being finite. Define $H_k(P) := P^{k,0}$ if $P^{k,0}$ is not finitely covered, and $H_k(P) := P^{k,1}$ otherwise; this is a definition by a property, and $H_k(P)$ is not finitely covered whenever $P$ is. [L7, step 2.1]

4.1 Recursion on $\mathbb{N} \times Z$, with $Z$ the set of functions from boxes to boxes, starting value $(0, \mathrm{id})$ and rule $(j, h) \mapsto (j+1,\ H_j \circ h)$ for $j < n$ and $(j,h) \mapsto (j+1,h)$ otherwise, produces $G_j$ for every $j$; put $G := G_n$. By induction on $j \le n$, $G_j(P) \subseteq P$ is a box whose $k$-th side is half that of $P$ for $k < j$ and equal to that of $P$ for $k \ge j$, and $G_j(P)$ is not finitely covered when $P$ is not. So $G(P) \subseteq P$ halves every side and preserves not being finitely covered. [L8, step 3.1]

5.1 Recursion applied to the starting value $Q$ and the rule $G$ produces boxes $P_m$ with $P_0 = Q$ and $P_{m+1} = G(P_m)$; each $P_m$ fails to be finitely covered, $P_{m+1} \subseteq P_m$, and the $k$-th side length of $P_m$ is $\ell_k (1/2)^m$, where $\ell_k := b_k - a_k \ge 0$. [L8, step 4.1]

6.1 For each $k < n$ the $k$-th intervals of the $P_m$ form a nested family of closed bounded intervals whose lengths $\ell_k(1/2)^m$ tend to $0$, so their intersection is a single point $p_k$; the function $p : n \to \mathbb{R}$, $k \mapsto p_k$, is a point of $\mathbb{R}^n$ lying in every $P_m$. [L7, L9, step 5.1]

7.1 Since $p \in P_0 = Q \subseteq \bigcup_{i \in I} U_i$, there is $i^{\ast} \in I$ with $p \in U_{i^{\ast}}$, and openness gives a real $r > 0$ with $B(p,r) \subseteq U_{i^{\ast}}$. [L11, step 6.1]

8.1 Put $L := \max\{\ell_k : k < n\} \ge 0$ and $C := \iota(n) L + 1 > 0$; for $x \in P_m$ each $|x_k - p_k|$ is at most the $k$-th side length of $P_m$, so $d_\infty(x,p) \le L (1/2)^m$ and $d_2(x,p) \le \iota(n) L (1/2)^m \le C (1/2)^m$ by step 1.2. Taking a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/N < r/C$ and then $m$ with $(1/2)^m < 1/N$ gives $P_m \subseteq B(p,r) \subseteq U_{i^{\ast}}$, so $P_m$ is finitely covered by the single set $U_{i^{\ast}}$, contradicting step 5.1. [L9, L10, L12, step 1.2, step 5.1, step 6.1, step 7.1, discharge-contradiction]

9.1 Therefore every such family has finitely many members covering $Q$, and $Q$ is a compact subset of $(\mathbb{R}^n,d_2)$: claim 1 is proved. [L4, step 2.1, step 8.1]

10.1 For claim 2, a compact $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is closed and bounded. [L5, step 9.1]

11.1 Conversely let $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ be closed and bounded; if $K = \emptyset$ it is compact, and otherwise $K \subseteq B(x_0,\rho)$ for some $x_0$ and real $\rho > 0$, so every $x \in K$ and $k < n$ satisfy $|x_k| \le |(x_0)_k| + |x_k - (x_0)_k| \le |(x_0)_k| + d_2(x,x_0) < |(x_0)_k| + \rho$ by step 1.1; with $M := \max\{|(x_0)_k| : k < n\} + \rho$ the box $Q_M := \{\, x : -M \le x_k \le M \ (k<n) \,\}$ contains $K$. [L10, L11, step 1.1, step 10.1]

12.1 $K$ is the trace on $Q_M$ of a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, namely of $K$ itself, so $K$ is closed in the metric subspace $Q_M$; that subspace is compact by step 9.1, so $K$ is compact, and claim 2 is proved. [L4, L6, step 9.1, step 11.1]

13.1 For claim 3, let $\psi : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^1$ send $t$ to the function $1 \to \mathbb{R}$ with value $t$; it is a bijection and $d_2(\psi(s),\psi(t)) = \sqrt{(s-t)^2} = |s-t| = d_{\mathbb{R}}(s,t)$, so $\psi$ carries each ball onto the corresponding ball, hence open sets onto open sets and open covers onto open covers with matching finite subfamilies, and likewise closed sets onto closed sets and bounded sets onto bounded sets. Applying claim 2 with $n = 1$ to $\psi[K]$ therefore gives claim 3. [L1, L3, L4, L11, step 12.1] ∎

## Remarks

**Why the bisection halves one coordinate at a time.** Halving all $n$ coordinates at once produces $2^n$ sub-boxes, and choosing one of them canonically means enumerating them, which needs a bijection between the functions $n \to \{0,1\}$ and a natural number. Halving a single coordinate produces two sub-boxes, and "the left one if it is still not finitely covered, the right one otherwise" is a definition by cases needing nothing at all. Composing $n$ such halvings, as step 4.1 does, recovers the full halving of every side and keeps the construction canonical, which is what a choice-free proof requires.

**Where each hypothesis is used.** Closedness enters only at step 12.1, through [[lem-closed-subset-of-a-compact-space-is-compact]]; boundedness enters only at step 11.1, to fit $K$ inside a box. Dropping either leaves a non-compact set: the whole of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is closed and unbounded, and an open ball is bounded and not closed, and neither is compact by claim 2.

**The converse direction is what fails in a general metric space.** Claim 2 says that in $\mathbb{R}^n$ closed and bounded is enough; that is special to $\mathbb{R}^n$, and [[fs-closed-and-bounded-implies-compact-in-every-metric-space]] records the false general statement together with a witness. What survives in every metric space is only the direction of step 10.1 ([[thm-compact-subset-is-closed-and-bounded]]).

**The case $n = 0$.** $\mathbb{R}^0$ has exactly one element, the empty function, and [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] does not treat it, because $d_\infty$ would be a maximum over the empty index set. On a one-element set the only metric is the one taking the value $0$, and the resulting space is compact for trivial reasons: it is listed as $\{x_0\}$, and any family of open sets covering it has a member containing $x_0$ ([[def-metric-compactness]]). Nothing above is needed for that case and nothing above claims it.

## Statement

Let $(X,d_X)$ be a compact metric space ([[def-metric-compactness]]), let
$(Y,d_Y)$ be any metric space ([[def-metric-space]]) and let $f : X \to Y$ be
continuous ([[def-metric-continuity]]). Then $f$ is uniformly continuous
([[def-metric-uniform-continuity]]).

No choice principle is used: the cover built below is cut out by a property, and
the Lebesgue number lemma it is fed to is itself choice free
([[thm-lebesgue-number-lemma]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A compact metric space $(X,d_X)$, a metric space $(Y,d_Y)$ and a continuous $f : X \to Y$.

[L1] $f$ is continuous at $a$: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ with $f[B_X(a,\delta)] \subseteq B_Y(f(a),\varepsilon)$ ([[def-metric-continuity]], [[def-metric-ball]]).

[L2] $f$ is uniformly continuous when for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that $d_X(x,x') < \delta$ implies $d_Y(f(x),f(x')) < \varepsilon$, for all $x,x' \in X$ ([[def-metric-uniform-continuity]]).

[L3] Every open cover of a compact metric space has a Lebesgue number: a real $\delta > 0$ such that every nonempty subset of diameter less than $\delta$ lies in a single member of the cover ([[thm-lebesgue-number-lemma]], [[def-metric-compactness]]).

[L4] Open balls are open ([[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]], [[def-metric-topology]]).

[L5] For nonempty bounded $A$, $\operatorname{diam}(A) = \sup\{d_X(u,v) : u,v \in A\}$; in particular $\operatorname{diam}(\{x,x'\}) = d_X(x,x')$, the set of distances being $\{0, d_X(x,x')\}$ and a metric being nonnegative ([[def-metric-bounded-diameter]], [[lem-metric-nonnegativity]]).

[L6] A metric is symmetric and satisfies the triangle inequality ([[def-metric-space]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 If $X = \emptyset$ the condition of uniform continuity holds vacuously, so assume $X \ne \emptyset$, and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real. [L2]

2.1 Put $\mathcal{U} := \{\, U \subseteq X : U \text{ is open in } X \text{ and } f[U] \subseteq B_Y(z, \varepsilon/2) \text{ for some } z \in Y \,\}$, a family cut out by a property and not by a selection. [L1, step 1.1]

3.1 $\mathcal{U}$ is an open cover of $X$: given $x \in X$, continuity at $x$ supplies a real $\delta_x > 0$ with $f[B_X(x,\delta_x)] \subseteq B_Y(f(x), \varepsilon/2)$, and $B_X(x,\delta_x)$ is open and contains $x$, so it belongs to $\mathcal{U}$. [L1, L4, step 2.1]

4.1 By the Lebesgue number lemma there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every nonempty subset of $X$ of diameter less than $\delta$ is contained in a single member of $\mathcal{U}$. [L3, step 3.1]

5.1 Let $x, x' \in X$ with $d_X(x,x') < \delta$; the set $\{x,x'\}$ is nonempty with diameter $d_X(x,x') < \delta$, so $\{x,x'\} \subseteq U$ for some $U \in \mathcal{U}$, and there is $z \in Y$ with $f[U] \subseteq B_Y(z,\varepsilon/2)$. [L5, step 2.1, step 4.1]

6.1 Then $d_Y(f(x),z) < \varepsilon/2$ and $d_Y(z,f(x')) < \varepsilon/2$, so $d_Y(f(x),f(x')) \le d_Y(f(x),z) + d_Y(z,f(x')) < \varepsilon$; as $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary, $f$ is uniformly continuous. [L2, L6, step 5.1] ∎

## Remarks

**The centre $z$ is not chosen, and that is why the proof is choice free.** The family $\mathcal{U}$ is defined by the *existence* of a suitable $z$, and the argument instantiates that existential once, at step 5.1, for the single member $U$ that the Lebesgue number produced. No function assigning a centre to every member of $\mathcal{U}$ is ever needed.

**Compactness is not removable.** The map $x \mapsto 1/x$ is continuous on the interval $(0,1)$ and is not uniformly continuous there ([[cex-heine-cantor-fails-without-compactness]]); $(0,1)$ is not compact.

**The codomain is arbitrary.** Nothing is assumed about $(Y,d_Y)$ — not completeness, not boundedness, not compactness. All the work is done on the domain side, which is where the finite subcover lives.
