You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as
an independent adversarial proof-refuter. Return evidence only; Audit-Alpha
alone adjudicates and edits.

## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` Statement or consumer, actively search for a
counterexample or a failure in the witness or cited generated premise. A false
public claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or
materially inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is
nonfatal.

Return no more than 450 words, exactly in this shape:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

For each defect:

```text
FINDING 1
  location: [exact section/fact/step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [exact assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]
```

Always end with:

```text
BOUNDARY: [specific boundary/counterexample checks and disposition]
SOURCES:  [confirm every supplied cited item used by the target was inspected]
CHECKED:  [confirm title, public claim, every numbered step, and Remarks]

## Example

For the ordinary Cantor set $C$, the slab $C\times[0,1]$ has content zero in $\mathbb R^2$, and hence Jordan content $0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The Cantor set $C$.

[L1] $C$ has one-dimensional content zero ([[thm-cantor-set-properties]], [[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

[L2] [[lem-integer-part]] controls the number of equal squares needed to stack across height $1$.

## Verification

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 Given $\varepsilon>0$, cover $C$ by finitely many positive-width intervals $I_r$ with $\sum_r\ell_r$ and $\max_r\ell_r$ sufficiently small. Degenerate members may be enlarged within the budget. [L1, choose, construct]

1.2 Above $I_r$, stack squares of side $\ell_r$. By [L2], at most $1/\ell_r+2$ squares suffice, with total area at most $\ell_r+2\ell_r^2$.   [L2, given]

2.1 Summing gives at most $\sum_r\ell_r+2(\max_r\ell_r)\sum_r\ell_r<\varepsilon$. Thus the slab has cube-content zero.   [step 1.1, step 1.2, given]

3.1 By [[def-jordan-inner-and-outer-content]], cube-content zero makes the Jordan outer content $0$. The nonnegative inner content is at most the outer content, so both are $0$; the slab is Jordan measurable with content $0$, unlike the fat-Cantor slab [[cex-compact-set-without-jordan-content]].   [step 2.1, given, discharge-construct] ∎

## Statement refuted

Every compact bounded subset of $\mathbb R^2$ is Jordan measurable.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The Smith-Volterra-Cantor set $S$ and $K=S\times[0,1]$.

[L1] $S$ is compact, nowhere dense, and every finite interval cover has total length at least $1/2$ ([[def-fat-cantor-set]], [[thm-fat-cantor-set-has-positive-measure]]).

[L2] The product lower bound is [[lem-product-lower-bound-for-jordan-content]].

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The slab $K$ is closed and bounded, hence compact by [[thm-heine-borel-rn]]. Since $S$ has empty interior, $K$ has empty interior and, being closed, equals its boundary.   [L1, given]

1.2 By [L1] and [L2], every rectangle cover of $K$ has total area at least $1/2$; its boundary therefore does not have content zero.   [L1, L2, given]

2.1 The boundary criterion [[thm-jordan-boundary-criterion]] makes $K$ non-Jordan-measurable.  [step 1.1, step 1.2] ∎

## Definition

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]) with additive identity $0_F$ and
multiplicative identity $1_F$. Define
$\iota : \mathbb{N} \to F$ by recursion on $\mathbb{N}$
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[thm-recursion]]):

$$\iota(0) \;:=\; 0_F, \qquad \iota(n+1) \;:=\; \iota(n) + 1_F .$$

$\iota(n)$ is the **canonical natural** of $n$ in $F$. It is also written
$n \cdot 1_F$, and for $n \ge 1$ it is $1_F$ added to itself $n$ times.

**Why the notation is needed at all.** A natural number in this library is a von
Neumann natural, that is a set ([[def-natural-numbers]]), and a set is not an
element of $F$. So $1/n$, $n^{\alpha}$ and $x/n$ are not expressions of $F$ when
$n$ is a natural: what they mean is $1/\iota(n)$, $\iota(n)^{\alpha}$ and
$x/\iota(n)$. The map $\iota$ is what carries a counting number into the field,
and writing it is the whole reason a reader meets $1/\iota(k+1)$ where an
informal text would write $1/(k+1)$.

## Remarks

- **Where the index shift comes from.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
  ([[def-natural-numbers]]) and $\iota(0) = 0_F$, so $1/\iota(k)$ is undefined at
  $k = 0$. A family of reciprocals indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ is therefore written
  over $\iota(k+1)$, which is why the harmonic and telescoping families of this
  library run over $k+1$ rather than over $k$. This is bookkeeping, not a
  restriction: the values are the usual ones.

- **This definition records notation; the arithmetic is proved elsewhere.** That
  $\iota$ is strictly increasing and positive on $n \ge 1$, and that it carries
  sums to sums and products to products, is [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], stated
  for an ordered field. That lemma introduces the same element by the equivalent
  recursion $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, which
  agrees with the definition above because $\iota(1) = \iota(0) + 1_F = 1_F$.
  Nothing here is new mathematics; the definition exists so that the notation has
  a home a reader can look up.

- **The symbol $\iota$ is used in this library for other canonical maps, and this
  definition does not govern them.** It also denotes the canonical field
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to F$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), the isometric
  embedding of a metric space into a completion ([[def-metric-completion]]), and
  an inclusion map $\iota : S \to X$ of a subspace. Each of those is introduced
  where it is used and means something different from the map defined here. What
  the four share is only that each is the canonical map of its situation.

- **Fields, not just ordered fields.** The recursion needs no order, so the
  definition is stated for a field; every use in this library is in an ordered
  field, and the order is what makes $\iota$ injective
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). In a field of positive characteristic $\iota$
  is not injective, which is one reason the injectivity is a lemma rather than
  part of the definition.

## Definition

For bounded $E\subseteq\mathbb R^m$, in the metric sense of [[def-metric-bounded-diameter]], its **Jordan outer content** is the infimum of $\sum_{r<q}\operatorname{vol}(R_r)$ over finite axis-parallel rectangle covers of $E$. Its **Jordan inner content** is the supremum of the same sums over finite families of rectangles contained in $E$ whose interiors are pairwise disjoint.

Metric boundedness always supplies a nondegenerate bounding rectangle. For
nonempty $E$, choose $x_0\in\mathbb R^m$ and $r>0$ with
$E\subseteq B(x_0,r)$. Since
$|x_j-(x_0)_j|\le d_\infty(x,x_0)\le d_2(x,x_0)<r$ for every coordinate
([[lem-metrics-on-rn]], [[lem-every-norm-on-rn-is-continuous-for-the-euclidean-metric]] clause 3, [[def-metric-ball]]), the nondegenerate box
$\prod_{j<m}[(x_0)_j-r,(x_0)_j+r]$ contains $E$. The empty set lies in
any fixed nondegenerate rectangle.

Thus the outer family is nonempty and the same bounding rectangle bounds the
inner sums; the empty family gives inner sum $0$. Refining all listed
endpoints into one grid and splitting the nested finite sums shows every
inscribed sum is at most every covering sum
([[def-multidimensional-grid-partition]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).
Completeness therefore supplies finite real extrema
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]],
[[lem-sup-unique]]).

The set is **Jordan measurable** when the contents agree, and their common value is its **Jordan content**. The empty set and every degenerate rectangle have content $0$.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), intervals and their lengths are as in
[[def-interval]], and a *sequence* is a function on $\mathbb{N}$, which contains
$0$. Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

- $A$ has **measure zero**, equivalently $A$ is **null**, when for every real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ there are sequences $(a_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ and
  $(b_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of reals with $a_k \le b_k$ for every $k$, such
  that
  $$A \subseteq \bigcup_{k \in \mathbb{N}} [a_k, b_k] \qquad \text{and} \qquad \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (b_k - a_k) \text{ converges with sum } \le \varepsilon .$$
- $A$ has **content zero** when for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there are
  $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and reals $a_0 \le b_0, \dots, a_n \le b_n$ with
  $$A \subseteq \bigcup_{j \le n} [a_j, b_j] \qquad \text{and} \qquad \sum_{j=0}^{n} (b_j - a_j) \le \varepsilon .$$

The number $b_k - a_k \ge 0$ is the length of $[a_k,b_k]$ ([[def-interval]]), and
the sums are the series and the finite sums of [[def-series]] and
[[def-finite-sum]].

**Working form: only the partial sums have to be checked.** All the terms
$b_k - a_k$ are $\ge 0$, so by claim 2 of
[[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]] the series converges exactly when
its partial sums are bounded above, and its sum is then their supremum.
Consequently, for a fixed $\varepsilon > 0$,

$$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(b_k - a_k) \text{ converges with sum} \le \varepsilon \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \sum_{k<n} (b_k - a_k) \le \varepsilon \ \text{ for every } n \in \mathbb{N},$$

since a supremum is $\le \varepsilon$ exactly when $\varepsilon$ is an upper
bound of the set it is the supremum of ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]). Every
verification of nullity below checks the right-hand condition.

**Closed intervals lose nothing.** A bounded interval with endpoints
$a \le b$ is contained in $[a,b]$ and has the same length ([[def-interval]]), so
a cover by intervals of any of the four bounded forms yields a cover by closed
intervals with the same lengths. The definition is therefore stated with closed
intervals once and for all. Covers by *open* intervals are a genuinely different
demand, and passing to one costs a little extra length: the enlargement
$[a_k,b_k] \subseteq (a_k - \delta_k,\ b_k + \delta_k)$ is carried out where it is
needed, in [[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]] and in
[[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]].

**Both notions are inherited by subsets.** If $B \subseteq A$ and $A$ is null,
then any cover of $A$ covers $B$, so $B$ is null; the same sentence with finite
covers shows a subset of a set of content zero has content zero.

**A finite cover is a countable cover, so content zero implies measure zero.**
Padding the list $[a_0,b_0], \dots, [a_n,b_n]$ with the degenerate intervals
$[0,0]$ for $k > n$ leaves the total length unchanged, by the splitting law for
finite sums ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]). This is recorded as a lemma with its
proof, [[lem-content-zero-implies-null]], because it is cited on its own.

## Remarks

- **The two notions genuinely differ.** $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$ is null and does
  not have content zero ([[cex-null-set-not-of-content-zero]]), so the two
  quantifier patterns, "a sequence of intervals" and "a finite list of
  intervals", are not interchangeable. They do agree for compact sets
  ([[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]]), and the compact case is the only one in
  which content zero is used anywhere on this pair of pages. Nothing is claimed
  about what later pages will do with it.

- **Why "content" and not "measure" for the finite version.** The finite-cover
  notion is the vanishing of the Jordan outer content, and the countable-cover
  notion is the vanishing of the Lebesgue outer measure. Neither outer quantity
  is defined in this library, and no item here assigns a nonzero size to any set:
  every statement is of the shape "can, or cannot, be covered by intervals of
  total length below such and such a bound". That is a deliberate restriction of
  scope at this point in the reading order, not a claim that the general notions
  are unavailable in mathematics.

- **Measure zero is not vacuous and not universal.** No interval with two
  distinct endpoints is null ([[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]]), while
  every at most countable set is ([[lem-countable-sets-are-null]]) and so is the
  uncountable Cantor set ([[thm-cantor-set-properties]]). The three facts
  together are what make the notion worth having.

## Definition

Fix a natural number $m\ge1$. For $a,b\in\mathbb R^m$ with $a_j\le b_j$ for $j<m$, define
$$[a,b]:=\{x\in\mathbb R^m:a_j\le x_j\le b_j\ (j<m)\},\qquad \operatorname{vol}[a,b]:=\prod_{j<m}(b_j-a_j).$$
The product is the recursively defined finite product of [[def-finite-sum]]. The rectangle is **nondegenerate** when every $a_j<b_j$, and it is a **cube** when all side lengths are equal.

Every factor is nonnegative, so volume is nonnegative. For a coordinate index $r<m$, cutting at $c\in[a_r,b_r]$ gives two rectangles whose volumes add to the original, by distributivity in that factor and [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]. Under the standard identification $\mathbb R^1\cong\mathbb R$ ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]], [[def-p-norms-on-rn]]), this is the interval $[a_0,b_0]$ and its length.

## Statement

Identify $\mathbb{Z}$ with its canonical copy inside $\mathbb{R}$, along the
embeddings $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$
([[lem-nat-embeds-int]], [[lem-int-embeds-rat]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]],
[[def-integers]]). Then for every real $x$ there is **exactly one** integer $m$
with

$$m \;\le\; x \;<\; m + 1 .$$

It is written $\lfloor x \rfloor$ and called the **integer part**, or **floor**,
of $x$.

**Two independent ingredients are needed and neither may be dropped.** Existence
is the Archimedean property ([[thm-of-archimedean]]) together with the
well-ordering of $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]): the first says
that $x$ is caught between two integers at all, the second picks the *least*
integer above $x$. Uniqueness is the discreteness of $\mathbb{Z}$: no integer
lies strictly between $m$ and $m+1$.

This lemma is stated once here and reused. It is what turns "the nearest integer
to $x$" from a picture into an object, and the companion page's oscillator
$\psi(x) = \inf_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} |x - n|$ is computed from it in one line.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real $x$. Naturals, integers and rationals are identified with their canonical copies in $\mathbb{R}$ along $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] The embeddings $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$ are injective and preserve $0$, $1$, addition, multiplication and order ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]], [[lem-int-embeds-rat]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]], [[def-integers]]); $\mathbb{Z}$ is a totally ordered commutative ring ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]], [[thm-int-comm-ring]]); every integer $\ge 0$ is the image of a unique natural, that map being injective and order preserving ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]); and a natural $j \ne 0$ satisfies $j \ge 1$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]], [[def-natural-numbers]]).

[L2] The image of a natural $n \ge 1$ under the composite $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ is the canonical natural $n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ of [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]. Indeed that composite preserves $1$ and addition by [L1], while $n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ is defined by $1 \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} = 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} = n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} + 1_{\mathbb{R}}$, so the two agree at $1$ and satisfy the same recursion; induction on $n$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]) gives the identification.

[L3] Archimedean property: for every real $t$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $t < n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L4] Well-ordering principle: every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L5] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: the order is total, so the negation of $t < u$ is $u \le t$; trichotomy, so $t < u$ and $u \le t$ cannot both hold; translation invariance ([[lem-of-add-order]]); $t \le |t|$ and $-t \le |t|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]); and transitivity ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 Apply [L3] to the real $|x|$: fix a natural $n \ge 1$ with $|x| < n$. Since $x \le |x|$ and $-x \le |x|$, this gives $-n < x < n$. [L2, L3, L5, choose]

2.1 Put $S := \{\, k \in \mathbb{N} \ : \ x < k - n \,\}$, where $k - n$ is formed in $\mathbb{Z}$ and read in $\mathbb{R}$ through [L1]. It is a subset of $\mathbb{N}$, and it is nonempty: the natural $2n$ satisfies $2n - n = n > x$ by step 1.1, so $2n \in S$. [step 1.1, L1, L2, construct]

3.1 By the well-ordering principle [L4] let $k_0$ be the least element of $S$. [step 2.1, L4, choose]

4.1 The index $k_0$ is not $0$: for $k = 0$ the defining condition reads $x < 0 - n = -n$, which trichotomy excludes since $-n < x$ by step 1.1. Hence $k_0 \ne 0$, so $k_0 \ge 1$ by [L1], and $k_0 - 1$ is again a natural number. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L1, L5]

5.1 Set $m := (k_0 - 1) - n$, an integer. Since $k_0 - 1 < k_0$ and $k_0$ is the least element of $S$, the natural $k_0 - 1$ does not lie in $S$, that is, $x < (k_0 - 1) - n$ fails; the order being total, $m = (k_0 - 1) - n \le x$. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L1, L5, construct]

6.1 On the other hand $k_0 \in S$ gives $x < k_0 - n = \bigl((k_0 - 1) - n\bigr) + 1 = m + 1$. So $m \le x < m + 1$, and existence is proved. [step 3.1, step 5.1, L1, L5]

7.1 Uniqueness: suppose an integer $m'$ also satisfies $m' \le x < m' + 1$ and $m' \ne m$. The order of $\mathbb{Z}$ being total, one of $m < m'$ and $m' < m$ holds, and the two cases are the same with the roles of $m$ and $m'$ exchanged; so assume $m < m'$. Then $m' - m$ is an integer $> 0$, hence by [L1] the image of a natural $j \ne 0$, so $j \ge 1$ and $m' - m \ge 1$, that is $m + 1 \le m'$. But then $x < m + 1 \le m' \le x$, which trichotomy forbids. Hence $m' = m$. [step 6.1, L1, L5]

8.1 Therefore exactly one integer $m$ satisfies $m \le x < m + 1$, and we write $m = \lfloor x \rfloor$. [step 6.1, step 7.1, discharge-construct] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the two halves of the proof really use.** Step 1.1 is the only use of the Archimedean property, and it is indispensable: in a non-Archimedean ordered field ([[cex-ordered-field-not-archimedean]]) an element larger than every canonical natural has no integer part at all, since the set $S$ of step 2.1 would be empty. Step 3.1 is the only use of the well-ordering principle, and it is what makes the construction canonical: no choice is made anywhere, and $\lfloor x \rfloor$ is a function of $x$.

- **Immediate consequences, used later.** From $m \le x < m + 1$ one reads off $0 \le x - m < 1$ and $0 < (m+1) - x \le 1$; and $\lfloor x \rfloor = x$ exactly when $x$ is an integer, since an integer $m$ satisfies $m \le m < m + 1$ and uniqueness does the rest. The translation identity $\lfloor x + p \rfloor = \lfloor x \rfloor + p$ for an integer $p$ follows the same way: adding $p$ to $m \le x < m+1$ gives $m + p \le x + p < (m + p) + 1$, and uniqueness identifies $m + p$ as the integer part of $x + p$.

- **The ceiling is not defined here** and is not needed on this page; it would be the least integer $\ge x$, obtained from the same set $S$ without the shift by one.

## Statement

Let $C$ be the Cantor set ([[def-cantor-set]]). Then:

1. $C$ is closed and bounded, hence compact
   ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]]);
2. $C$ has content zero, and therefore measure zero
   ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]);
3. $C$ is perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]);
4. $C$ is uncountable ([[def-countable]]);
5. $C$ contains no interval with two distinct endpoints, and is nowhere dense
   ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]]);
6. every nonempty connected subset of $C$ ([[def-connected-r]]) is a single
   point.

Claim 6 is what the phrase "totally disconnected" names elsewhere; that phrase
is **not** used here, because no definition of total disconnectedness exists at
this point in the reading order. What is proved is exactly the displayed
statement, and it is obtained from claim 5 through
[[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The sets $C_n$ and $C$ of [[def-cantor-set]], and the map $\Phi$ and the set $D$ of $\{0,2\}$-valued sequences of [[thm-cantor-set-ternary-description]].

[L1] $C_0 = [0,1]$, $C_{n+1} = \tfrac13 C_n \cup (\tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C_n)$, $C = \bigcap_n C_n \subseteq C_m$ for every $m$, every $C_n \subseteq [0,1]$, $0 \in C$, and $3^{-n} = (3^{-1})^n$ ([[def-cantor-set]], [[def-interval]], [[def-integer-power]], [[lem-power-laws]]).

[L2] $\Phi$ is a bijection from $D$ onto $C$, $\Phi(a) = \sum_{k \ge 0} a_k 3^{-k-1}$, and convergent series add and scale termwise ([[thm-cantor-set-ternary-description]], [[lem-series-linearity]], [[def-series]]).

[L3] $[c,d]$ is a closed set and a bounded interval, $(c,d)$ is open, $N_\varepsilon(x) = (x-\varepsilon, x+\varepsilon)$, and every open set contains a neighbourhood of each of its points ([[def-interval]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L4] Finite unions of closed sets are closed, and an intersection of a nonempty family of closed sets is closed ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]).

[L5] A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is compact exactly when it is closed and bounded ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L6] Content zero and measure zero as in [[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]; a set of content zero is null ([[lem-content-zero-implies-null]]); no null set contains an interval $[u,v]$ with $u < v$ ([[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]]).

[L7] $P$ is perfect when it is closed and no point of it is isolated in it ([[def-perfect-set-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]); every nonempty perfect subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable ([[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]], [[def-countable]]).

[L8] A set is nowhere dense exactly when the interior of its closure is empty, and a closed set equals its closure ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]]).

[L9] A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is connected exactly when it is order-convex ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]], [[def-connected-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L10] $|r|^k \to 0$ for $|r| < 1$ ([[lem-geometric-sequence-null]]); convergence to $0$ is tested against rational $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-real-limit]]); $|z| \ge 0$, $|z| = z$ for $z \ge 0$, and $|uv| = |u||v|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L11] Induction on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]); finite sums split, scale and are monotone in their terms ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L12] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 > 0$, $3 > 0$, $3^{-1} > 0$ and $0 < 2 \cdot 3^{-1} < 1$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve an inequality; the order is total and transitive ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **$C$ is compact, claim 1.** First, for $\lambda \ne 0$ and $c \in \mathbb{R}$ the set $\lambda S + c := \{\lambda s + c : s \in S\}$ is closed whenever $S$ is: if $x \notin \lambda S + c$ then $(x - c)\lambda^{-1} \notin S$, so by [L3] there is a real $\eta > 0$ with $N_\eta((x-c)\lambda^{-1}) \cap S = \varnothing$, and every $z$ with $|z - x| < |\lambda|\eta$ satisfies $|(z-c)\lambda^{-1} - (x-c)\lambda^{-1}| = |z-x| \cdot |\lambda|^{-1} < \eta$ by [L10] and [L12], hence $(z-c)\lambda^{-1} \notin S$ and $z \notin \lambda S + c$. Now every $C_n$ is closed, by induction on $n$ ([L11]): $C_0 = [0,1]$ is closed by [L3], and $C_{n+1}$ is the union of the two closed sets $\tfrac13 C_n$ and $\tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C_n$, hence closed by [L4]. So $C = \bigcap_n C_n$ is closed by [L4], and $C \subseteq [0,1]$ is bounded by [L1] and [L3]; by [L5] it is compact. [L1, L3, L4, L5, L10, L11, L12]

1.2 **$C$ has content zero and measure zero, claim 2.** By induction on $n$ ([L11]) the following holds for every $n$: there are $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and reals $u_0 \le v_0, \dots, u_m \le v_m$ with $C_n \subseteq \bigcup_{j \le m}[u_j,v_j]$ and $\sum_{j \le m}(v_j - u_j) = (2 \cdot 3^{-1})^{n}$. At $n = 0$ take the single interval $[0,1]$, of total length $1 = (2 \cdot 3^{-1})^0$ by [L1]. Given such a list at $n$, define $2m + 2$ intervals by $[u_j 3^{-1},\, v_j 3^{-1}]$ for $j \le m$ and $[2 \cdot 3^{-1} + u_{j-m-1}3^{-1},\, 2 \cdot 3^{-1} + v_{j-m-1}3^{-1}]$ for $m < j \le 2m+1$; they cover $\tfrac13 C_n$ and $\tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C_n$ respectively, hence cover $C_{n+1}$, and their total length is $3^{-1}(2 \cdot 3^{-1})^{n} + 3^{-1}(2 \cdot 3^{-1})^{n} = (2 \cdot 3^{-1})^{n+1}$ by [L11] and [L12]. Since $0 < 2 \cdot 3^{-1} < 1$ by [L12], [L10] gives, for every real $\varepsilon > 0$, an $n$ with $(2 \cdot 3^{-1})^{n} \le \varepsilon$; as $C \subseteq C_n$ by [L1], the corresponding finite list covers $C$ with total length at most $\varepsilon$. So $C$ has content zero by [L6], and hence measure zero by [L6]. [L1, L6, L10, L11, L12]

2.1 **$C$ is perfect, claim 3.** $C$ is closed by step 1.1. Let $x \in C$ and let the real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. By [L2] write $x = \Phi(a)$ with $a \in D$. By [L10] and [L12] fix $k \in \mathbb{N}$ with $2 \cdot 3^{-k-1} < \varepsilon$, and define $b \in D$ by $b_j := a_j$ for $j \ne k$ and $b_k := 2 - a_k$, so $b_k \in \{0,2\}$ and $b \ne a$. Then $\Phi(b) \in C$ and $\Phi(b) \ne \Phi(a)$ by [L2], while $\Phi(b) - \Phi(a) = \sum_{j \ge 0}(b_j - a_j)3^{-j-1} = (b_k - a_k)3^{-k-1}$ by [L2], all other terms being $0$, so $|\Phi(b) - x| = 2 \cdot 3^{-k-1} < \varepsilon$ by [L10]. Thus $N_\varepsilon(x)$ contains a point of $C$ other than $x$, for every $\varepsilon$, so $x$ is not isolated in $C$; by [L7] $C$ is perfect. [step 1.1, L2, L7, L10, L12]

2.2 **$C$ contains no nondegenerate interval and is nowhere dense, claim 5.** By step 1.2 the set $C$ is null, so by [L6] it contains no $[u,v]$ with $u < v$; in particular it contains no interval of any of the four bounded forms with distinct endpoints, since such an interval contains a closed one with distinct endpoints by [L6] and [L12]. Its interior is therefore empty: if $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq C$ for some real $\varepsilon > 0$, then $[x - \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1},\, x + \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}] \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq C$ by [L3] and [L12], an interval with distinct endpoints. Since $C$ is closed by step 1.1, it equals its closure, so [L8] gives that $C$ is nowhere dense. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L3, L6, L8, L12]

3.1 **$C$ is uncountable, claim 4.** $C$ is nonempty, since $0 \in C$ by [L1], and perfect by step 2.1, so [L7] applies. [step 2.1, L1, L7]

3.2 **Connected subsets, claim 6.** Let $E \subseteq C$ be connected and nonempty. By [L9] $E$ is order-convex, so if $u, v \in E$ with $u < v$ then $[u,v] \subseteq E \subseteq C$, contradicting step 2.2. Hence no two distinct elements of $E$ exist, and $E$, being nonempty, is a single point. [step 2.2, L9, L12]

4.1 Claims 1 to 6 are steps 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 3.1, 2.2 and 3.2 respectively, so all six hold. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, step 3.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Two independent proofs of uncountability.** The route above is [[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]] applied to a nonempty perfect set. The other is claim 3 of [[thm-cantor-set-ternary-description]]: $C$ is in bijection with $\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$, which is in bijection with the power set of $\mathbb{N}$, uncountable by [[thm-cantor-powerset]]. The two arguments share nothing, and the second is the one that makes the *size* of $C$ evident: $C$ is in bijection with the power set of $\mathbb{N}$, while having content zero. **It is deliberately not said here that $C$ has as many points as $\mathbb{R}$.** That would require a bijection between $\mathbb{R}$ and the power set of $\mathbb{N}$, and no such bijection is constructed anywhere at this point in the reading order; the two uncountability results available here are separate facts, one proved by the diagonal argument on power sets and one by nested intervals.

- **Claim 2 and claim 4 together are the point of the whole construction.** A set of measure zero may be uncountable, so nullity is not a cardinality condition; and a nowhere dense set need not be null, so it is not a category condition either ([[fs-nowhere-dense-implies-measure-zero]], [[thm-fat-cantor-set-has-positive-measure]]).

- **Why claim 5 is proved through measure and not by inspection.** The intervals making up $C_n$ have length $3^{-n}$, and one can see directly that a long interval cannot fit inside $C$. Doing that rigorously means keeping track of the $2^n$ component intervals of $C_n$ and their gaps; going through [[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]] uses the estimate already made in step 1.2 and needs no such bookkeeping.

- **Every point of $C$ is a limit of other points of $C$, and the witnesses are explicit**: change one ternary digit far out, as step 2.1 does. This is also what shows $C$ has no isolated points without any appeal to the structure of its complement.
