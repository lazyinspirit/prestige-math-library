You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as
an independent adversarial proof-refuter. Return evidence only; Audit-Alpha
alone adjudicates and edits.

## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` Statement or consumer, actively search for a
counterexample or a failure in the witness or cited generated premise. A false
public claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or
materially inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is
nonfatal.

Return no more than 450 words, exactly in this shape:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

For each defect:

```text
FINDING 1
  location: [exact section/fact/step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [exact assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]
```

Always end with:

```text
BOUNDARY: [specific boundary/counterexample checks and disposition]
SOURCES:  [confirm every supplied cited item used by the target was inspected]
CHECKED:  [confirm title, public claim, every numbered step, and Remarks]
```

## Example

The parabola segment $\{(x,x^2):0\le x\le1\}$ has content zero in $\mathbb R^2$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $f(x)=x^2$ on $[0,1]$.

[L1] Polynomials are continuous ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L2] Graphs of continuous functions on closed rectangles have content zero ([[thm-graphs-of-continuous-functions-have-content-zero]]).

## Verification

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Apply [L2] to the continuous polynomial in [L1].  [L1, L2]

1.2 Directly, divide $[0,1]$ into $N\ge1$ equal subintervals. On each one, $|x^2-y^2|\le2/\iota(N)$, so four squares of side $1/\iota(N)$ cover that graph piece. The resulting finite cover has total area at most $4/\iota(N)$, which can be made arbitrarily small. [L1, given]

2.1 Both arguments establish content zero.  [step 1.1, step 1.2] ∎

## Definition

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]) with additive identity $0_F$ and
multiplicative identity $1_F$. Define
$\iota : \mathbb{N} \to F$ by recursion on $\mathbb{N}$
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[thm-recursion]]):

$$\iota(0) \;:=\; 0_F, \qquad \iota(n+1) \;:=\; \iota(n) + 1_F .$$

$\iota(n)$ is the **canonical natural** of $n$ in $F$. It is also written
$n \cdot 1_F$, and for $n \ge 1$ it is $1_F$ added to itself $n$ times.

**Why the notation is needed at all.** A natural number in this library is a von
Neumann natural, that is a set ([[def-natural-numbers]]), and a set is not an
element of $F$. So $1/n$, $n^{\alpha}$ and $x/n$ are not expressions of $F$ when
$n$ is a natural: what they mean is $1/\iota(n)$, $\iota(n)^{\alpha}$ and
$x/\iota(n)$. The map $\iota$ is what carries a counting number into the field,
and writing it is the whole reason a reader meets $1/\iota(k+1)$ where an
informal text would write $1/(k+1)$.

## Remarks

- **Where the index shift comes from.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
  ([[def-natural-numbers]]) and $\iota(0) = 0_F$, so $1/\iota(k)$ is undefined at
  $k = 0$. A family of reciprocals indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ is therefore written
  over $\iota(k+1)$, which is why the harmonic and telescoping families of this
  library run over $k+1$ rather than over $k$. This is bookkeeping, not a
  restriction: the values are the usual ones.

- **This definition records notation; the arithmetic is proved elsewhere.** That
  $\iota$ is strictly increasing and positive on $n \ge 1$, and that it carries
  sums to sums and products to products, is [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], stated
  for an ordered field. That lemma introduces the same element by the equivalent
  recursion $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, which
  agrees with the definition above because $\iota(1) = \iota(0) + 1_F = 1_F$.
  Nothing here is new mathematics; the definition exists so that the notation has
  a home a reader can look up.

- **The symbol $\iota$ is used in this library for other canonical maps, and this
  definition does not govern them.** It also denotes the canonical field
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to F$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), the isometric
  embedding of a metric space into a completion ([[def-metric-completion]]), and
  an inclusion map $\iota : S \to X$ of a subspace. Each of those is introduced
  where it is used and means something different from the map defined here. What
  the four share is only that each is the canonical map of its situation.

- **Fields, not just ordered fields.** The recursion needs no order, so the
  definition is stated for a field; every use in this library is in an ordered
  field, and the order is what makes $\iota$ injective
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). In a field of positive characteristic $\iota$
  is not injective, which is one reason the injectivity is a lemma rather than
  part of the definition.

## Definition

Let $a \in \mathbb{R}$, where $\mathbb{R}$ is the ambient ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]).

**Natural exponents.** By the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) applied to
the set $\mathbb{R}$, the starting element $1$ and the function
$f(x) = x \cdot a$, there is a unique function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$,
written $n \mapsto a^n$, with

$$a^0 = 1, \qquad a^{n+1} = a^n \cdot a \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Thus $a^1 = a$, $a^2 = a \cdot a$, and so on. Note that this is defined for
**every** $a$, including $a = 0$.

**Negative exponents.** If $a \ne 0$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, set

$$a^{-n} := (a^n)^{-1}.$$

**Why that is legitimate.** The right-hand side presupposes that $a^n$ is
invertible, that is, that $a^n \ne 0$. This is a proof obligation and not an
observation, and it is discharged by claim 2 of [[lem-power-laws]]: for $a \ne 0$
in a field, $a^n \ne 0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, proved there by induction on
$n$ from the fact that a field has no zero divisors ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]).
That lemma is a statement *about* the operation introduced here, so it depends on
this definition and is recorded in this item's `justified_by` rather than in its
`deps` (SCHEMA §3). Given $a^n \ne 0$, the value $(a^n)^{-1}$ is a single
well-determined element, because multiplicative inverses in a field are unique
([[lem-of-inverse-unique]]).

**Integer exponents.** Every integer $m$ ([[def-integers]]) is either
$\iota(n)$ or $-\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$, where $\iota$ is the
embedding $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]],
[[def-int-operations]]). This too is a citation and not a slogan: the order on
$\mathbb{Z}$ is total ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), so $m \ge 0$ or $m < 0$; the
image of $\iota$ is exactly the set of nonnegative integers, and each of them is
$\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]); and if $m < 0$ then
$-m > 0$, by compatibility of the order with addition ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]),
so $-m = \iota(n)$ and $m = -\iota(n)$, with $n$ unique because $\iota$ is
injective. The two clauses above therefore define $a^m$ for every
$m \in \mathbb{Z}$ whenever $a \ne 0$, and for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$ for
arbitrary $a$. The clauses are consistent where they overlap: the only overlap is
$m = 0$, where $-\iota(0) = \iota(0)$ and $(a^0)^{-1} = 1^{-1} = 1 = a^0$.

## Remarks

- **The convention $0^0 = 1$ is adopted here**, and it is not a matter of taste
  but of agreement with the recursion above: $a^0 = 1$ is the starting value for
  every $a$, exactly as the empty product is $1$ ([[def-finite-sum]]). This is
  the convention that makes the empty product, the binomial theorem, and
  polynomial notation $\sum_k c_k x^k$ work at $x = 0$ without an exception. The
  competing convention "$0^0$ undefined" belongs to contexts where $x^y$ is
  studied as a function of two *real* variables and one wants continuity, which
  is unavailable and irrelevant here: the exponent in $a^m$ is an integer, never
  a real.
- $0^n = 0$ for every $n \ge 1$, since $0^{n} = 0^{n-1} \cdot 0 = 0$, a product
  with a zero factor ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]); and
  $0^{-n}$ is not defined for $n \ge 1$, since $0$ has no inverse.
- The exponent is an integer and stays an integer. Rational exponents are a
  separate construction resting on the existence of roots
  ([[thm-nth-roots-exist]], [[def-rational-power]]), and real exponents do not
  exist in this library yet ([[rem-real-exponents-deferred]]).
- The laws $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$ are
  proved, not assumed, in [[lem-power-laws]]; the order behaviour of $a \mapsto a^n$
  is [[lem-power-monotone]].

## Definition

Fix $m\ge1$. A **closed cube** is a rectangle $\prod_{j<m}[a_j,a_j+\ell]$ with $\ell\ge0$; its volume is $\ell^m$. A set $E\subseteq\mathbb R^m$ is **null** when, for every $\varepsilon>0$, it is covered by a sequence of closed cubes whose nonnegative volume series converges with sum at most $\varepsilon$. It has **content zero** when such a cover can be finite.

The series and finite sums are [[def-series]] and [[def-finite-sum]], and their nonnegative bounds use [[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]] and [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]. Both properties pass to subsets. Padding a finite cover with degenerate zero-volume cubes proves that content zero implies null. This terminology defines only cover-nullity; it does not define a measure on arbitrary sets.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field, with field structure as in [[def-field]], and for
$n \ge 1$ let $n \cdot 1_F$ denote the canonical natural number
$\underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$, defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$
and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$. Then for every $n \ge 1$:

- $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$;
- the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$;
- $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ and $(mn) \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F)$ for all $m, n \ge 1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ whose canonical naturals are defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, with $0 \cdot 1_F = 0$.

[L1] $0 < 1_F$ in every ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] The order is compatible with addition and positives are closed under addition: $a < b$ implies $a + c < b + c$, and $a > 0$, $b > 0$ imply $a + b > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 1$: by definition $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, and $1_F > 0$. [L1, base]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: assume $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for some fixed $n \ge 1$. [ih]

1.3 By the recursion, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F - n \cdot 1_F = 1_F > 0$, so $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$. [given, L1]

1.4 Additive identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ by the recursion, and if $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ then $(m+n+1) \cdot 1_F = (m+n) \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + (n+1) \cdot 1_F$. [given, algebra]

2.1 Inductive step: $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ is a sum of two positives, by the hypothesis and $1_F > 0$, hence $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Iterating 1.3, for $m < n$ one has $m \cdot 1_F < n \cdot 1_F$, so $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing and therefore injective on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$. [step 1.3, L2]

2.3 Multiplicative identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m \cdot 1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(1 \cdot 1_F)$, and the step $(m(n+1)) \cdot 1_F = (mn + m) \cdot 1_F = (mn) \cdot 1_F + m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F) + (m \cdot 1_F)(1_F) = (m \cdot 1_F)((n+1) \cdot 1_F)$ uses 1.4 and distributivity. [step 1.4, algebra]

3.1 By induction on 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for every $n \ge 1$; with the strict increase 2.2 and the identities 1.4, 2.3, every claim holds. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 1.4, step 2.3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$, let
$\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Suppose $f$ and $g$ are continuous at
$c$ ([[def-continuity-real]]). Then:

1. $f + g$, $\alpha f$ and $fg$ are continuous at $c$;
2. $|f|$, the function $x \mapsto |f(x)|$, is continuous at $c$;
3. $\max\{f,g\}$ and $\min\{f,g\}$, defined pointwise by
   $x \mapsto \max\{f(x), g(x)\}$ and $x \mapsto \min\{f(x), g(x)\}$
   ([[def-max-min]]), are continuous at $c$;
4. if $g(c) \ne 0$ then, writing $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$, the
   point $c$ lies in $A_0$ and the quotient
   $(f/g)|_{A_0} : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$, $x \mapsto f(x)/g(x)$, is continuous at
   $c$ as a function on $A_0$.

Moreover, with no hypothesis at all:

5. every constant function $A \to \mathbb{R}$ and the identity
   $\mathrm{id} : A \to \mathbb{R}$, $x \mapsto x$, are continuous on $A$; hence
   so is $x \mapsto x^{n}$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$
   ([[def-integer-power]]), and hence so is every **polynomial function**
   $x \mapsto a_0 + a_1 x + \dots + a_n x^{n}$ with real coefficients.

Consequently, if $f$ and $g$ are continuous **on** $A$ then so are $f+g$,
$\alpha f$, $fg$, $|f|$, $\max\{f,g\}$ and $\min\{f,g\}$, and
$(f/g)|_{A_0}$ is continuous on $A_0$.

**Claim 4 is stated on $A_0$ because $f/g$ is not defined where $g$ vanishes**,
and $g$ may well vanish at points of $A$ far from $c$. The hypothesis is
$g(c) \ne 0$, not "$g$ nowhere zero"; what it buys is that $c$ itself lies in
the smaller domain, which is what makes continuity there mean anything.

**Nothing here is proved through a sequence.** Claims 1 and 4 are read off from
[[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]], which is itself proved from $\varepsilon$
and $\delta$, and claims 2, 3 and 5 are proved directly below. So no choice
principle is used anywhere in this item.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, functions $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\alpha$, a point $c \in A$ at which $f$ and $g$ are continuous, and, for claim 4, the hypothesis $g(c) \ne 0$ together with $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$.

[L1] Continuity at $c$: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L2] A point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$, and never both; at an isolated point of its domain every function is continuous; at a limit point $c$ of $A$, continuity of $f$ at $c$ is exactly the statement that the limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and equals $f(c)$ ([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-function-limit]]).

[L3] Algebra of function limits at a limit point $c$ of $A$: if the limits of $f$ and $g$ at $c$ exist with values $L$ and $M$, then the limits of $f+g$, $\alpha f$ and $fg$ at $c$ exist with values $L+M$, $\alpha L$ and $LM$; and if $M \ne 0$ then $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$, and the limit of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$ exists and equals $L/M$ ([[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]]).

[L4] Sign preservation: if the limit of $g$ at a limit point $c$ of $A$ exists and is nonzero, then $c$ is a limit point of $A_0 = \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$ ([[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]]).

[L5] Reverse triangle inequality: $\bigl||u| - |v|\bigr| \le |u - v|$ ([[cor-of-reverse-triangle]]); and $|u| \ge 0$, $|u| = 0$ exactly when $u = 0$, $|uv| = |u||v|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L6] Maximum and minimum of a two-element set of reals exist ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]), and for all reals $u, v$ one has $\max\{u,v\} = \tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(u + v + |u-v|\bigr)$ and $\min\{u,v\} = \tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(u + v - |u-v|\bigr)$.

[L7] Ordered-field arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: trichotomy and totality of the order, the field identities, and $0 < 1$ so that $2 \ne 0$ and $t/2$ is defined ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]).

[L8] Integer powers: $a^{0} = 1$ and $a^{n+1} = a^{n} \cdot a$ ([[def-integer-power]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Justification of the identity in [L6].** Let $u, v \in \mathbb{R}$. By totality either $u \ge v$ or $v \ge u$. If $u \ge v$ then $u - v \ge 0$, so $|u-v| = u-v$ and $\tfrac{1}{2}(u+v+|u-v|) = \tfrac{1}{2}(2u) = u = \max\{u,v\}$, while $\tfrac{1}{2}(u+v-|u-v|) = v = \min\{u,v\}$. If $v \ge u$ the same computation with the roles exchanged applies, since $|u-v| = v-u$ there. [L5, L6, L7]

1.2 **The isolated case.** Suppose $c$ is an isolated point of $A$, say $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ with $\eta > 0$ real. Then every function on $A$ is continuous at $c$ by [L2], which gives claims 1, 2 and 3 at once. For claim 4, assume $g(c) \ne 0$; then $c \in A_0$, and $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A_0 \subseteq N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ with $c$ in the left-hand side, so $c$ is an isolated point of $A_0$ and every function on $A_0$, in particular $(f/g)|_{A_0}$, is continuous at $c$. [L2]

1.3 **Claim 2, at any point of $A$.** Let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given and let $\delta > 0$ be as in [L1] for $f$ and this $\varepsilon$. For $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ the reverse triangle inequality gives $\bigl||f(x)| - |f(c)|\bigr| \le |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$. So $|f|$ is continuous at $c$, and no case distinction was needed. [L1, L5]

1.4 **Claim 5, constants and the identity.** If $f$ is constant then $|f(x) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$ for every $x \in A$ and every real $\varepsilon > 0$, so any $\delta > 0$ serves. For the identity, given a real $\varepsilon > 0$ take $\delta := \varepsilon$: every $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ has $|\mathrm{id}(x) - \mathrm{id}(c)| = |x - c| < \varepsilon$. Both are continuous at every point of $A$. [L1, L5, L7]

1.5 **The limit-point case, claim 1.** Suppose $c$ is a limit point of $A$. By [L2] the limits of $f$ and of $g$ at $c$ exist and equal $f(c)$ and $g(c)$. By [L3] the limits of $f+g$, $\alpha f$ and $fg$ at $c$ exist and equal $f(c)+g(c)$, $\alpha f(c)$ and $f(c)g(c)$, which are exactly the values of those three functions at $c$; by [L2] again, each of them is continuous at $c$. [L2, L3]

1.6 **The limit-point case, claim 4.** Suppose $c$ is a limit point of $A$ and $g(c) \ne 0$. Then $c \in A_0$, and by [L4] the point $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$. By [L3] the limit of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$ exists and equals $f(c)/g(c)$, which is the value of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$; by [L2] applied on the domain $A_0$, that function is continuous at $c$. [L2, L3, L4]

2.1 **Claims 1 and 4 in general.** By [L2] the point $c$ is either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$; step 1.2 settles the first case and steps 1.5 and 1.6 the second. So claims 1 and 4 hold as stated. [step 1.2, step 1.5, step 1.6, L2]

3.1 **Claim 3.** By claim 1 the function $f - g = f + (-1)g$ is continuous at $c$, by step 1.3 so is $|f-g|$, and by claim 1 again so are $f + g + |f-g|$ and its scalar multiple by $1/2$. By step 1.1 that scalar multiple is the function $x \mapsto \max\{f(x), g(x)\}$, so the maximum is continuous at $c$; the same argument with $-|f-g|$ gives the minimum. [step 1.1, step 1.3, step 2.1, L6, L7]

3.2 **Claim 5, powers and polynomials.** The map $x \mapsto x^{0}$ is the constant $1$ and $x \mapsto x^{1}$ is the identity, both continuous on $A$ by step 1.4; and if $x \mapsto x^{n}$ is continuous on $A$ then so is $x \mapsto x^{n+1} = x^{n} \cdot x$, being a product of two functions continuous on $A$ by step 2.1. By induction on $n$, $x \mapsto x^{n}$ is continuous on $A$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. A polynomial function $a_0 + a_1x + \dots + a_nx^{n}$ is obtained from these by finitely many scalar multiplications and additions, each of which preserves continuity by step 2.1. [step 1.4, step 2.1, L8]

4.1 Claims 1 to 5 are proved, all of them at an arbitrary point $c$ of $A$ and therefore, applied at every point, on the whole of $A$; and no sequence and no choice principle was used. [step 1.3, step 2.1, step 3.1, step 3.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the two-case shape, and why it is not an inconvenience.** Continuity is defined at every point of the domain, including isolated points, where no limit exists ([[def-continuity-real]]). The algebra of limits therefore cannot be applied blindly; but at an isolated point every function is continuous, so the case is settled before it is opened. Claims 2 and 5 are proved directly from $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ and need no case distinction at all.

- **Absolute value, maximum and minimum are not in [[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]]**, and the reason is that they are not needed there. They are needed here: the extreme value theorem and the one-dimensional fixed point theorem both build auxiliary functions out of maxima, minima and differences, and [[thm-compactness-is-necessary-for-evt-and-uniform-continuity]] builds its witnesses out of $|x - x_0|$ and quotients.

- **The converse of claim 2 is false**: $|f|$ may be continuous while $f$ is continuous nowhere. The function equal to $1$ on $\mathbb{Q}$ and to $-1$ elsewhere has constant absolute value; that it is nowhere continuous follows from the argument of [[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]] applied verbatim, since that argument uses only that the two values are distinct.

## Statement

Let $m\ge1$, let $Q\subseteq\mathbb R^m$ be a closed nondegenerate rectangle, and let $f:Q\to\mathbb R$ be continuous. Its graph has content zero in $\mathbb R^{m+1}$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $Q,f$ as stated.

[L1] $Q$ is compact and $f$ uniformly continuous ([[thm-heine-borel-rn]], [[thm-heine-cantor-metric]], [[def-metric-continuity]]).

[L2] Grid cells and cube volumes are [[def-multidimensional-grid-partition]] and [[def-multidimensional-rectangle-and-volume]].

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 Given $\varepsilon>0$, choose a uniform coordinate grid with cell widths at most $\delta$, where uniform continuity makes the oscillation of $f$ on each cell below a vertical amount $\eta$. Since $Q$ is nondegenerate, the grid may be chosen so that the number $N_\delta$ of cells satisfies $N_\delta\delta^m\le C_Q$ for a constant depending only on $Q$. [L1, L2, given, choose, construct]

2.1 One horizontal cube footprint of side $\delta$ covers each domain cell. Above it, stack $(m+1)$-cubes of side $\delta$ across the graph's vertical range. [[lem-integer-part]] bounds their number by $\eta/\delta+2$, so all stacks together have volume at most $N_\delta(\eta\delta^m+2\delta^{m+1})\le C_Q(\eta+2\delta)$. [step 1.1, L2, given]

3.1 Summing over the finitely many domain cells gives total covering volume at most a rectangle-dependent constant times $\eta+\delta$. Choose $\eta$ and then $\delta$ to make this below $\varepsilon$.   [step 2.1, given, choose]

4.1 This finite cube cover proves content zero in the sense of [[def-null-and-content-zero-in-rn]].  [step 3.1, discharge-construct] ∎
