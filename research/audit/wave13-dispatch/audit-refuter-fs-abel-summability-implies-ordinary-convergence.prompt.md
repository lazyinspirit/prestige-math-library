You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as
an independent adversarial proof-refuter. Return evidence only; Audit-Alpha
alone adjudicates and edits.

## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` Statement or consumer, actively search for a
counterexample or a failure in the witness or cited generated premise. A false
public claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or
materially inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is
nonfatal.

Return no more than 450 words, exactly in this shape:

## Statement

**False claim:** every Abel-summable real series converges ordinarily.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Grandi's series $\sum_{n\ge0}(-1)^n$.

[L1] For $0\le x<1$, the geometric series gives $\sum_{n\ge0}(-1)^nx^n=1/(1+x)$ ([[thm-geometric-series]]).

[L2] Ordinary convergence means convergence of the partial-sum sequence, whereas Abel summability uses the boundary limit of the power series ([[def-series]], [[def-abel-and-cesaro-summability-of-a-series]]).

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L1], the Abel transform tends to $1/2$ as $x\uparrow1$, so the series is Abel summable to $1/2$. [L1, L2]

2.1 Its inclusive partial sums alternate between $1$ and $0$, so they do not converge. Hence Abel summability alone does not imply ordinary convergence. [given, L2] ∎

## Definition

For a real series $\sum_{n\ge0}a_n$, write its inclusive partial sums as

$$S_n:=\sum_{k=0}^{n}a_k$$

and their Cesaro means as

$$\sigma_n:=\frac1{\iota(n+1)}\sum_{k=0}^{n}S_k.$$

The series is **Cesaro summable to $s$** if $\sigma_n\to s$ ([[def-cesaro-mean]]).

It is **Abel summable to $s$** if the power series

$$A(x):=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_nx^n$$

converges for every $0\le x<1$ and $\lim_{x\uparrow1}A(x)=s$ in the one-sided sense of [[def-function-limit]]. These are summability methods for the zero-indexed series of [[def-series]]; they do not assert ordinary convergence.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-real-numbers]]) and
a **sequence of reals** is a function $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$
([[def-sequence]]), written $(a_k)$; recall that $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$.

**Partial sums.** Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals. Its **sequence of partial
sums** is

$$s_n \;:=\; \sum_{k < n} a_k \qquad (n \in \mathbb{N}),$$

the finite sum of [[def-finite-sum]]. In particular $s_0 = 0$, the empty sum, and
$s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ for every $n$, those being exactly the two recursion clauses
that define the finite sum. Note that $s_n$ is the sum of the $n$ terms
$a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$, so the index $n$ counts terms rather than naming the last
one.

**Convergence, the sum, divergence.** The **series** of $(a_k)$, written
$\sum a_k$, **converges** when the sequence $(s_n)$ of partial sums converges
([[def-real-limit]]), and then the **sum of the series** is

$$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k \;:=\; \lim_{n} s_n .$$

The series **diverges** when $(s_n)$ does not converge. A convergent sequence of
reals has exactly one limit ([[lem-limit-unique]]), so the displayed symbol names
a single real number and nothing further has to be checked for it to be
well defined.

**Series with a general starting index.** Let $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $a$ be a
function on $\{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : k \ge m \,\}$, which we call a **family from
$m$** and write $(a_k)_{k \ge m}$. The series

$$\sum_{k \ge m} a_k$$

is by definition the series of the sequence $b_j := a_{j + m}$,
$j \in \mathbb{N}$, which is a genuine sequence of reals; it converges exactly
when that series converges, and its sum is then written
$\sum_{k = m}^{\infty} a_k$. Its partial sums are

$$\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k \;=\; \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j} \qquad (n \ge m),$$

in the notation of [[def-finite-sum]], the value at $n = m$ being the empty sum
$0$. A sequence on $\mathbb{N}$ is the case $m = 0$, and the two readings of
$\sum a_k$ agree there, since $b_j = a_j$.

**This clause is not a convenience.** Sequences in this library are functions on
$\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$ ([[def-sequence]]), while many of the
classical series are built from expressions that are undefined at the index $0$:
$1/k$, $1/k^{p}$ and $|a_k|^{1/k}$ all require $k \ge 1$. Writing such a series as
$\sum_{k \ge 1} a_k$ names an honest object, whereas writing it as a sequence on
$\mathbb{N}$ would require a value at an index where the defining expression has
none. Every statement on this page says which starting index it uses.

**Tail series.** For $N \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$N$-th tail series** of
$\sum a_k$ is $\sum_{k \ge N} a_k$, that is the series of the $N$-th tail
$a^{(N)}$ of [[def-sequence]], whose terms are $a^{(N)}_j = a_{j+N}$. The
$0$-th tail series is the series itself.

## Remarks

- **"Diverges" here means "does not converge", and nothing more.** A divergent
  series may have partial sums that run away to $+\infty$, or to $-\infty$, or
  that oscillate without settling anywhere. The three behaviours are not
  distinguished by the word, and no statement on this page uses "diverges" to
  mean "the partial sums are unbounded" unless it says so.

- **The symbol $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k$ is defined only for a convergent
  series.** It denotes a real number, not a formal object, and it is illegitimate
  to write it down before convergence has been established. Where a proof needs
  to speak of the series without knowing whether it converges, it speaks of
  $(a_k)$ and of $(s_n)$.

- **Two indices, doing different work.** The index $k$ runs over the terms and is
  bound; the index $n$ runs over the partial sums and is the variable in which the
  limit is taken. Confusing them is the commonest slip in the subject, and it is
  the reason the definition above fixes $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ rather than
  $\sum_{k \le n} a_k$: with this choice the recursion $s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ is
  the one supplied by [[def-finite-sum]], with no shift anywhere.

## Statement

Let $r \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $r^k$ be the integer power ([[def-integer-power]]),
so that $r^0 = 1$ for every $r$, including $r = 0$.

1. If $|r| < 1$ then the series $\sum r^k$ converges ([[def-series]]) and
   $$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} r^{k} \;=\; \frac{1}{1-r} .$$
2. If $|r| \ge 1$ then $\sum r^k$ diverges.

The series starts at $k = 0$ and its first term is $r^0 = 1$; in particular
$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} 2^{-k} = 2$, while the series starting at $k = 1$ sums to
$1$. Which starting index is meant has to be said, and it is said here.

**Given:** A real number $r$, the integer powers $r^k$ ([[def-integer-power]]), and the partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} r^k$ of $\sum r^k$ ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[L1] Factorisation of a difference of powers: for $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and natural $n \ge 1$, $b^n - a^n = (b-a)\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a^k b^{\,n-1-k}$ ([[lem-power-difference-factorisation]]).

[L2] For $|r| < 1$ the sequence $(r^k)$ is null, that is $r^k \to 0$ ([[lem-geometric-sequence-null]]).

[L3] Algebra of limits: sums, differences and quotients of convergent sequences converge to the corresponding combination, the quotient rule requiring a nonzero limit and nonzero denominators ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L4] Absolute value: $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$, $|x| \ge 0$, and $|x| = 0$ exactly when $x = 0$; also $|1| = 1$, since $1 > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L5] Powers and order: $a^0 = 1$ for every $a$; if $a \ge 1$ and $n \ge 1$ then $a^n \ge a \ge 1$; and $1^n = 1$ for every $n$ ([[lem-power-monotone]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L6] The principle of induction ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L7] If a series converges then its terms tend to $0$ ([[lem-nth-term-test]]).

[L8] Notation of [[def-finite-sum]]: $\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x_k$ is $\sum_{k<n} x_k$, and the empty sum $\sum_{k<0} x_k$ is $0$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Assume $|r| < 1$. [assume-case lt]

1.2 Assume instead $|r| \ge 1$. [assume-case ge]

1.3 For every natural $n \ge 1$, applying [L1] with $b = 1$ and $a = r$ gives $1 - r^n = (1-r)\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} r^k \cdot 1^{\,n-1-k} = (1-r)\,s_n$, using $1^m = 1$ and the notation of [L8]. [L1, L5, L8]

1.4 At $n = 0$ the identity $1 - r^n = (1-r)s_n$ also holds, both sides being $0$ because $r^0 = 1$ and $s_0$ is the empty sum. [L5, L8]

2.1 In the case $|r| < 1$ we have $r \ne 1$, since $|1| = 1$ and $|r| < 1$; hence $1 - r \ne 0$. [step 1.1, L4, algebra]

2.2 In the case $|r| \ge 1$, an induction gives $|r^k| = |r|^k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$: at $k = 0$ both sides are $1$, and if $|r^k| = |r|^k$ then $|r^{k+1}| = |r^k \cdot r| = |r^k|\,|r| = |r|^k |r| = |r|^{k+1}$. [step 1.2, L4, L5, L6]

2.3 In the case $|r| \ge 1$ we get $|r|^k \ge 1$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$: at $k = 0$ this reads $1 \ge 1$, and for $k \ge 1$ it is the comparison $|r|^k \ge |r| \ge 1$. [step 1.2, L5]

3.1 In the case $|r| < 1$, dividing by $1 - r \ne 0$ gives $s_n = (1 - r^n)/(1-r)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.1, step 1.3, step 1.4, algebra]

3.2 In the case $|r| \ge 1$, combining the two previous steps gives $|r^k - 0| = |r^k| = |r|^k \ge 1$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.2, step 2.3]

4.1 In the case $|r| < 1$ the sequence $(r^n)$ is null, so $1 - r^n \to 1$ and therefore $s_n \to 1/(1-r)$, the denominator being the nonzero constant $1-r$; hence $\sum r^k$ converges with sum $1/(1-r)$, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 3.1, step 2.1, L2, L3]

4.2 In the case $|r| \ge 1$ the sequence $(r^k)$ does not converge to $0$, since the rational tolerance $\varepsilon = 1$ admits no index $K$ with $|r^k - 0| < 1$ for all $k \ge K$; so by the term test $\sum r^k$ diverges, which is claim 2. [step 3.2, L7]

5.1 The two cases $|r| < 1$ and $|r| \ge 1$ exhaust the possibilities, since the order on $\mathbb{R}$ is total, so claims 1 and 2 together cover every real $r$. [step 4.1, step 4.2, cases-exhaustive] ∎

## Remarks

- **The divergence half needs no separate treatment of $r = 1$ and $r = -1$.** Both are covered by $|r| \ge 1$, and the single reason is the same in every case: the terms have absolute value at least $1$, so they cannot tend to $0$. For $r = 1$ the partial sums are $s_n = n$ and run to $+\infty$; for $r = -1$ they oscillate between $0$ and $1$. The theorem says only that neither converges, which is all that "diverges" means here ([[def-series]]).

- **Why the identity is proved at $n = 0$ separately.** [[lem-power-difference-factorisation]] requires $n \ge 1$, since its right-hand side is a sum over $k < n$ of a term involving $b^{\,n-1-k}$, and $n-1$ is not a natural number at $n = 0$. The identity is still true at $n = 0$, but by inspection of two empty objects rather than by that lemma, and step 1.4 says so rather than letting the reader assume the citation covers it.
