You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as
an independent adversarial proof-refuter. Return evidence only; Audit-Alpha
alone adjudicates and edits.

## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` Statement or consumer, actively search for a
counterexample or a failure in the witness or cited generated premise. A false
public claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or
materially inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is
nonfatal.

Return no more than 450 words, exactly in this shape:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

For each defect:

```text
FINDING 1
  location: [exact section/fact/step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [exact assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]
```

Always end with:

```text
BOUNDARY: [specific boundary/counterexample checks and disposition]
SOURCES:  [confirm every supplied cited item used by the target was inspected]
CHECKED:  [confirm title, public claim, every numbered step, and Remarks]

## Definition

A **grid partition** $P$ of a nondegenerate rectangle $Q=[a,b]\subseteq\mathbb R^m$ is a family, one for each $j<m$, of one-dimensional partitions $a_j=t_{j,0}<\cdots<t_{j,n_j}=b_j$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]). For a multi-index $i=(i_0,\ldots,i_{m-1})$ with $i_j<n_j$, its cell is
$$Q_i:=\prod_{j<m}[t_{j,i_j},t_{j,i_j+1}].$$
A sum over cells means the iterated recursive sum $\sum_{i_0<n_0}\cdots\sum_{i_{m-1}<n_{m-1}}$ of [[def-finite-sum]]. The **mesh** is $\max_{j<m,i_j<n_j}(t_{j,i_j+1}-t_{j,i_j})$, which exists by [[lem-finite-set-has-max]] and is the largest $d_\infty$-diameter ([[def-p-norms-on-rn]], [[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]]).

Refinement is coordinatewise. Coordinatewise union gives a common refinement. The cells cover $Q$ and have pairwise disjoint interiors. Repeated splitting of finite sums and induction on $m$ give
$$\sum_i\operatorname{vol}(Q_i)=\operatorname{vol}(Q).$$
These statements include boundary overlaps: boundaries may meet, but interiors do not, and volume splitting is algebraic.

## Definition

Throughout this page $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), in particular an ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]]) and a field ([[def-field]]), and $\mathbb{N}$ is the set
of natural numbers ([[def-natural-numbers]]) with successor $\sigma(n) = n + 1$
([[def-nat-addition]]).

Let $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a sequence of reals, written $a_k$ for
$a(k)$. **Finite sums and finite products of $a$ are defined by recursion on the
upper index**, which is legitimate because of the recursion theorem
([[thm-recursion]]). That theorem produces a function of one variable, so the
running index has to be carried along inside the value: applying it to the set
$A = \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$, the starting element $(0, 0)$ and the function
$f(n, s) = (\sigma(n),\, s + a_n)$ gives a unique
$g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$ with

$$g(0) = (0, 0), \qquad g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n)) \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Write $g(n) = \big(\pi_1(g(n)),\, \Sigma_n\big)$ for its two coordinates.

**The first coordinate is the index itself, and that is a small induction, not an
observation** ([[thm-induction-principle]]). Indeed $\pi_1(g(0)) = 0$; and if
$\pi_1(g(n)) = n$, then
$g(\sigma(n)) = f\big(\pi_1(g(n)), \Sigma_n\big) = \big(\sigma(\pi_1(g(n))),\, \Sigma_n + a_{\pi_1(g(n))}\big) = \big(\sigma(n),\, \Sigma_n + a_n\big)$,
so $\pi_1(g(\sigma(n))) = \sigma(n)$. By induction $\pi_1(g(n)) = n$ for every
$n \in \mathbb{N}$. Only now may the second coordinate of the two displayed
clauses be read off, and doing so gives

$$\Sigma_0 = 0, \qquad \Sigma_{\sigma(n)} = \Sigma_n + a_n .$$

$\Sigma$ is moreover the **unique** function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with those
two properties: if $\Sigma'$ also has them then $n \mapsto (n, \Sigma'_n)$ satisfies
the two clauses defining $g$, hence equals $g$ by the uniqueness clause of
[[thm-recursion]], so $\Sigma' = \Sigma$.

We write $\sum_{k < n} a_k := \Sigma_n$. The same construction with starting
element $(0, 1)$ and $f(n, p) = (\sigma(n),\, p \cdot a_n)$, with the same
induction on the first coordinate and the same uniqueness argument, gives the
unique $\Pi : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with

$$\Pi_0 = 1, \qquad \Pi_{\sigma(n)} = \Pi_n \cdot a_n ,$$

and we write $\prod_{k < n} a_k := \Pi_n$.

**Notation.** For $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ we abbreviate

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \sum_{k < n+1} a_k, \qquad \prod_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \prod_{k < n+1} a_k,$$

and, for a general lower index $m$ with $m \le n + 1$, writing $d = n + 1 - m$
for the number of terms,

$$\sum_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \sum_{j < d} a_{m+j}, \qquad \prod_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \prod_{j < d} a_{m+j} .$$

When $m = n + 1$ we have $d = 0$ and the sum is **empty**, with value $0$, while
the empty product has value $1$. In the same spirit $\sum_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ is
notation for the empty sum $\Sigma_0 = 0$ and $\prod_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ for the
empty product $\Pi_0 = 1$; the index $-1$ never occurs as an element of
$\mathbb{N}$ and is only a way of writing "no terms".

Only finitely many values of $a$ enter $\sum_{k<n} a_k$, so the notation
$\sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\prod_{k<n} a_k$ is also used for a list
$a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$ of reals given without reference to any extension of the
list to all of $\mathbb{N}$: extend the list by $a_k = 0$ (respectively
$a_k = 1$) for $k \ge n$ and apply the definition above.

## Remarks

- **Why recursion and not "$a_0 + a_1 + \cdots + a_{n-1}$".** The dots are not a
  definition: they presuppose that the displayed pattern determines a value for
  every $n$, which is exactly what the recursion theorem
  ([[thm-recursion]]) supplies, and its uniqueness clause is what makes
  $\sum_{k<n} a_k$ a single well-determined real rather than a family of choices.
  Associativity and commutativity of addition are *not* used in the definition;
  they are used in the laws proved from it ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).
- **Naturals and rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$ (a convention used on the whole
  page).** A natural number $n$ and a rational number $r$ are not literally
  elements of $\mathbb{R}$: they enter $\mathbb{R}$ through the canonical
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$, which is an injective,
  order-preserving field homomorphism ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), restricting on
  positive naturals to $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} = 1_\mathbb{R} + \cdots + 1_\mathbb{R}$
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). Following ordinary practice, and only where no
  confusion is possible, we write $n$ for $\iota(n)$ and $r$ for $\iota(r)$; so,
  for instance, $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k<n} a_k$ means
  $\iota(n)^{-1} \cdot \sum_{k<n} a_k$, which makes sense because
  $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$. Exponents are the one place where the
  identification is deliberately NOT made: in $a^n$ and $a^r$ the exponent stays
  a natural, an integer or a rational ([[def-integer-power]],
  [[def-rational-power]]), never a real.
- The two indexings are related by $\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k = \sum_{k < n+1} a_k$, so
  a statement proved for one is available for the other. Sums over $k < n$ are
  the primitive form here because $\Sigma_0$, the empty sum, is then the base
  case of every induction, and no index outside $\mathbb{N}$ is ever needed.

## Definition

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $m \in \mathbb{R}$.

- $m$ is a **maximum** (or *greatest element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $s \le m$
  for every $s \in S$.
- $m$ is a **minimum** (or *least element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $m \le s$
  for every $s \in S$.

A set has at most one maximum: if $m_1$ and $m_2$ are both maxima then
$m_1 \in S$ gives $m_1 \le m_2$ and $m_2 \in S$ gives $m_2 \le m_1$, so
$m_1 = m_2$ by antisymmetry of the order, which is immediate from the trichotomy
axiom of an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).
The same argument applies to minima, so we may write $\max S$ and $\min S$.

## Remarks

- A maximum is precisely an upper bound of $S$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]])
  that happens to lie in $S$; a minimum is a lower bound of $S$
  ([[def-bounded-set]]) that lies in $S$. In particular a set with a maximum is
  bounded above and a set with a minimum is bounded below.
- The empty set has neither a maximum nor a minimum, because the requirement
  $m \in S$ cannot be met.
- The membership requirement $m \in S$ is exactly what separates a maximum from a
  supremum, and it is the theme of this page. A supremum is a bound on the set
  and is not asked to belong to it; a maximum is an element of the set. The two
  agree exactly when the supremum happens to be attained ([[lem-max-is-sup]]),
  and they genuinely differ in general ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has both a maximum and a minimum
  ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]), which is what licenses the notation
  $\max\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$. Infinite sets need not: the failure of attainment is
  an infinitary phenomenon.

## Definition

Fix a natural number $m\ge1$. For $a,b\in\mathbb R^m$ with $a_j\le b_j$ for $j<m$, define
$$[a,b]:=\{x\in\mathbb R^m:a_j\le x_j\le b_j\ (j<m)\},\qquad \operatorname{vol}[a,b]:=\prod_{j<m}(b_j-a_j).$$
The product is the recursively defined finite product of [[def-finite-sum]]. The rectangle is **nondegenerate** when every $a_j<b_j$, and it is a **cube** when all side lengths are equal.

Every factor is nonnegative, so volume is nonnegative. For a coordinate index $r<m$, cutting at $c\in[a_r,b_r]$ gives two rectangles whose volumes add to the original, by distributivity in that factor and [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]. Under the standard identification $\mathbb R^1\cong\mathbb R$ ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]], [[def-p-norms-on-rn]]), this is the interval $[a_0,b_0]$ and its length.

## Definition

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be the function space of
[[def-euclidean-inner-product]], with $x_k := x(k)$ for $k < n$.

### The $p$-norm, for a rational exponent $p \ge 1$

Let $p \in \mathbb{Q}$ with $p \ge 1$. For $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ put

$$\lVert x\rVert_p \;:=\; \Bigl(\sum_{k<n} |x_k|^{p}\Bigr)^{1/p},$$

where $|\cdot|$ is the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]), the sum is the finite
sum of [[def-finite-sum]], and both powers are the **rational** powers of
[[def-rational-power]].

**Every power written here is defined.** Each base $|x_k|$ is a nonnegative real
and $p > 0$, so $|x_k|^{p}$ is given by [[def-rational-power]] for $|x_k| > 0$
and by its supplementary clause $0^{p} = 0$ for $|x_k| = 0$; the sum of these
nonnegative terms is nonnegative ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 4), and
$1/p$ is a positive rational, so the outer power is defined for the same two
reasons. The value does not depend on which representative of $p$ or of $1/p$ is
used ([[lem-rational-power-well-defined]]).

**The exponent is a rational, and that is not a matter of taste.**
[[def-rational-power]] supplies $a^{r}$ for a nonnegative base and a **rational**
exponent only; real exponents do not exist at this point in the reading order,
and [[rem-real-exponents-deferred]] records exactly why. This is also why the
published Minkowski inequality [[thm-minkowski-finite]], which is what makes the
triangle inequality work below, is itself stated for rational $p \ge 1$. **No
statement on this page is written for $p$ ranging over a real interval.**

### The maximum norm

For $n \ge 1$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ put

$$\lVert x\rVert_\infty \;:=\; \max\{\, |x_k| \;:\; k < n \,\},$$

the maximum of a nonempty finite set of reals, which exists and is one of its
elements ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

**The hypothesis $n \ge 1$ is required and propagates.** At $n = 0$ the set
$\{|x_k| : k<n\}$ is empty and has no maximum ([[def-max-min]]). This is the same
restriction the published [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] carries, for the same reason, and
**every statement on this page that mentions $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ inherits
it**. The $p$-norms for rational $p \ge 1$ carry no such restriction: at $n = 0$
each is the empty sum raised to a positive rational power, hence $0$.

### The three cases the rest of the page uses

- $\lVert x\rVert_1 = \sum_{k<n}|x_k|$, since $t^{1} = t$ for $t \ge 0$
  ([[lem-rational-power-laws]], and $0^{1} = 0$ by the supplementary clause).
- $\lVert x\rVert_2 = \bigl(\sum_{k<n}|x_k|^{2}\bigr)^{1/2} = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}x_k^{2}}$,
  which is exactly the Euclidean norm of [[def-euclidean-inner-product]]: the
  exponent $2$ agrees with the integer power, so $|x_k|^{2} = x_k^{2}$
  ([[lem-of-abs-value]]), and $t^{1/2}$ is the unique nonnegative square root of
  $t$, which is $\sqrt{t}$ ([[def-rational-power]], [[thm-of-square-roots]]).
  **The two notations denote the same function and no second Euclidean norm is
  introduced.**
- $\lVert x\rVert_\infty$ as above, for $n \ge 1$.

That each of these is a norm in the sense of [[def-norm-and-normed-space]], and
that the metrics they induce are exactly the published $d_1$, $d_2$ and
$d_\infty$ of [[lem-metrics-on-rn]], is
[[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]]; it is proved there
and is not assumed here.

## Remarks

- **Why $p \ge 1$.** The triangle inequality for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$ is
  Minkowski's inequality, and [[thm-minkowski-finite]] is stated for rational
  $p \ge 1$. For $0 < p < 1$ the displayed expression is still defined but is not
  a norm on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n \ge 2$; nothing on this page asserts anything
  about that range, and the expression is never written with such an exponent.

- **Monotonicity in the base is what makes the comparisons below work.** For a
  fixed positive rational $r$ the map $a \mapsto a^{r}$ is strictly increasing on
  the positive reals ([[lem-rational-power-monotone]] clause 2), so an inequality
  between nonnegative sums passes through the outer power. That is the only
  property of rational powers used in the comparison chain of
  [[lem-every-norm-on-rn-is-continuous-for-the-euclidean-metric]].

- **The subscript $\infty$ is a name, not a number.** No arithmetic is performed
  with it, and $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ is not $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$ for any
  exponent; it is a separately defined function that happens to sit at the end of
  the family. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$ silently that
  [[def-interval]] records for the interval notation.

## Definition

**Standing hypothesis for this page.** Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete
ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]),
$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers and **contains $0$**
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[def-nat-order]]), $\iota : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$
is the canonical natural ([[def-canonical-natural]]), and $a, b$ are reals with

$$a \;<\; b .$$

Intervals and their lengths are those of [[def-interval]]; finite sums are those
of [[def-finite-sum]], indexed as $\sum_{i<n}$ over $i \in \mathbb{N}$.

### Partitions

A **partition of $[a,b]$** is a pair $P = (n, t)$ consisting of a natural number
$n \ge 1$ and a sequence $t : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-sequence]]) with

$$t_0 = a, \qquad t_i < t_{i+1} \ \text{ for every } i < n, \qquad t_k = b \ \text{ for every } k \ge n .$$

The tail convention on the third clause is bookkeeping only: it makes $t$ a
genuine sequence, so that the finite-sum laws of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] apply to
it verbatim, and it costs nothing because no index above $n$ is ever read. The
first two clauses say exactly that

$$a \;=\; t_0 \;<\; t_1 \;<\; \dots \;<\; t_n \;=\; b ,$$

the last equality because $t_n = b$ by the third clause. In particular
$i \mapsto t_i$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on
$\{\, i \in \mathbb{N} : i \le n \,\}$ ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]),
and $a \le t_i \le b$ for every $i \le n$.

The **point set** of $P$ is the finite set

$$\operatorname{pts}(P) \;:=\; \{\, t_i \ : \ i \le n \,\} \;\subseteq\; [a,b], \qquad a, b \in \operatorname{pts}(P) .$$

The **subintervals** of $P$ are

$$I_i \;:=\; [\,t_i,\ t_{i+1}\,] \qquad (i < n),$$

and their **lengths** are $\Delta_i := t_{i+1} - t_i$. Each $\Delta_i > 0$, so
each $I_i$ is a nondegenerate closed bounded interval ([[def-interval]]). There
are $n$ of them and they are indexed from $i = 0$, not from $i = 1$: the first
subinterval is $[t_0, t_1] = [a, t_1]$.

**The lengths sum to $b - a$.** By the telescoping law, clause 5 of
[[lem-finite-sum-laws]],

$$\sum_{i<n} \Delta_i \;=\; \sum_{i<n} (t_{i+1} - t_i) \;=\; t_n - t_0 \;=\; b - a .$$

**The mesh.** The set $\{\, \Delta_i : i < n \,\}$ is a nonempty finite set of
reals, nonempty because $n \ge 1$, so it has a maximum
([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]). The **mesh** of $P$ is

$$\|P\| \;:=\; \max\{\, \Delta_i \ : \ i < n \,\} \;>\; 0 ,$$

and $\Delta_i \le \|P\|$ for every $i < n$.

**The uniform partition.** For a natural $N \ge 1$, the **uniform partition of
$[a,b]$ into $N$ parts** is $U_N := (N, t)$ with

$$t_i \;:=\; a + \iota(i)\,\frac{b-a}{\iota(N)} \quad (i \le N), \qquad t_k := b \quad (k \ge N).$$

This is a partition: $t_0 = a$; $t_N = a + (b-a) = b$; and $t_{i+1} - t_i =
(b-a)/\iota(N) > 0$ for $i < N$, because $\iota(N) > 0$ and $\iota(i+1) =
\iota(i) + 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[def-canonical-natural]]). Its
subinterval lengths are all equal to $(b-a)/\iota(N)$, so

$$\|U_N\| \;=\; \frac{b-a}{\iota(N)} .$$

### A partition is determined by its point set

**Claim.** If $P = (n,t)$ and $P' = (n', t')$ are partitions of $[a,b]$ with
$\operatorname{pts}(P) = \operatorname{pts}(P')$, then $n = n'$ and $t_i = t'_i$
for every $i \le n$.

*Proof.* First, $t_i = t'_i$ for every $i \le \min\{n,n'\}$, by induction on $i$
([[thm-induction-principle]]). For $i = 0$ both equal $a$. Suppose $t_j = t'_j$
for all $j \le i$ and $i + 1 \le \min\{n,n'\}$. The set
$S := \{\, x \in \operatorname{pts}(P) : x > t_i \,\}$ has $t_{i+1}$ as its least
element: $t_{i+1} \in S$, and any $x \in S$ is $t_j$ for some $j \le n$ with
$t_j > t_i$, which forces $j > i$ because $t$ is increasing on indices $\le n$,
hence $j \ge i+1$ and $x = t_j \ge t_{i+1}$. The same argument in $P'$ makes
$t'_{i+1}$ the least element of
$\{\, x \in \operatorname{pts}(P') : x > t'_i \,\}$, which is the same set $S$,
since the point sets agree and $t'_i = t_i$. A set has at most one least element
([[def-max-min]]), so $t_{i+1} = t'_{i+1}$.

Second, $n = n'$. If $n < n'$ then $t'_n = t_n = b$ by the previous paragraph,
while $t'_n < t'_{n'} = b$ because $t'$ is increasing on indices $\le n'$ and
$n < n'$; that is impossible. Exchanging the roles of $P$ and $P'$ rules out
$n' < n$. $\square$

So the map $P \mapsto \operatorname{pts}(P)$ is injective, and a partition may be
named by its point set whenever one is exhibited.

### Inserting a point

Let $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ and let $c \in [a,b]$. Define a
partition $P + c$ of $[a,b]$ as follows.

- If $c \in \operatorname{pts}(P)$, put $P + c := P$.
- Otherwise $c \ne a$ and $c \ne b$, so $a < c < b$. The set
  $T := \{\, t_i : i \le n \text{ and } t_i < c \,\}$ is a nonempty finite set of
  reals, nonempty because $t_0 = a < c$, so it has a maximum
  ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]); let $i_0 \le n$ be the unique index with
  $t_{i_0} = \max T$, unique because $t$ is injective on indices $\le n$. Then
  $i_0 < n$, since $t_n = b > c$ puts $t_n \notin T$; and
  $$t_{i_0} \;<\; c \;<\; t_{i_0+1},$$
  the right inequality because $t_{i_0+1} \ne c$ (as $c \notin \operatorname{pts}(P)$)
  and $t_{i_0+1} < c$ would put $t_{i_0+1} \in T$ with $t_{i_0+1} > t_{i_0} = \max T$.
  Put $P + c := (n+1, s)$ with
  $$s_i := t_i \ (i \le i_0), \qquad s_{i_0+1} := c, \qquad s_i := t_{i-1} \ (i_0 + 2 \le i \le n+1), \qquad s_k := b \ (k \ge n+1).$$

In both cases $P + c$ is a partition of $[a,b]$ and

$$\operatorname{pts}(P + c) \;=\; \operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \{c\}, \qquad \|P+c\| \;\le\; \|P\| .$$

The displayed identity is immediate from the two cases. For the mesh: in the
first case nothing changes; in the second the list of subinterval lengths of
$P + c$ is that of $P$ with $\Delta_{i_0}$ replaced by the two numbers
$c - t_{i_0}$ and $t_{i_0+1} - c$, each of which is smaller than
$\Delta_{i_0} = (c - t_{i_0}) + (t_{i_0+1} - c)$ because the other is positive.
So every length of $P + c$ is at most a length of $P$, and the maximum cannot
increase. Finally the index count grows by exactly $1$ in the second case and
not at all in the first.

### Refinement and the common refinement

$P'$ **refines** $P$, and is a **refinement** of $P$, when

$$\operatorname{pts}(P) \;\subseteq\; \operatorname{pts}(P') .$$

Let $P = (n,t)$ and $Q = (m,s)$ be partitions of $[a,b]$. Applying the recursion
theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) to the set $\mathbb{N} \times \mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$,
where $\mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$ is the set of partitions of $[a,b]$, with starting
element $(0, P)$ and the map $(j, R) \mapsto (j+1,\ R + s_j)$ — legitimate
because $s_j \in [a,b]$ for every $j \in \mathbb{N}$ — gives a unique family
$(R_j)_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ of partitions with $R_0 = P$ and $R_{j+1} = R_j + s_j$.
The **common refinement** of $P$ and $Q$ is

$$P \vee Q \;:=\; R_{m+1} .$$

**Its point set is the union.** By induction on $j$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]),
$\operatorname{pts}(R_j) = \operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \{\, s_l : l < j \,\}$;
taking $j = m+1$ gives

$$\operatorname{pts}(P \vee Q) \;=\; \operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \operatorname{pts}(Q).$$

Hence $P \vee Q$ refines both $P$ and $Q$; by the uniqueness claim above it is
the **only** partition with that point set, so $P \vee Q = Q \vee P$, and

$$P' \text{ refines } P \quad \Longrightarrow \quad P \vee P' = P' ,$$

since then $\operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \operatorname{pts}(P') =
\operatorname{pts}(P')$.

**Two size bounds, both used later.** Writing $n_R$ for the first component of a
partition $R$:

$$\|P \vee Q\| \;\le\; \|P\|, \qquad n_{P \vee Q} \;\le\; n_P + n_Q - 1 .$$

The first is the mesh bound above applied $m+1$ times. For the second, each
insertion raises the index count by at most $1$, and the two insertions of
$s_0 = a$ and $s_m = b$ raise it by $0$, since $a$ and $b$ already lie in
$\operatorname{pts}(P)$ and hence in $\operatorname{pts}(R_j)$ for every $j$; so
at most $m - 1$ of the $m+1$ insertions increase it.

### The index map of a refinement

Let $P' = (n',t')$ refine $P = (n,t)$. For each $i \le n$ the point $t_i$ lies in
$\operatorname{pts}(P')$, so there is exactly one $\varphi(i) \le n'$ with
$t'_{\varphi(i)} = t_i$, uniqueness because $t'$ is injective on indices $\le n'$.
The resulting map $\varphi$ satisfies

$$\varphi(0) = 0, \qquad \varphi(n) = n', \qquad \varphi(i) < \varphi(i+1) \ \ (i < n),$$

the first two because $t'_0 = a = t_0$ and $t'_{n'} = b = t_n$ together with
injectivity, and the third because $t_i < t_{i+1}$ and $t'$ is increasing on
indices $\le n'$. In particular $n \le n'$. Moreover, for $i < n$ and
$\varphi(i) \le j < \varphi(i+1)$,

$$I'_j \;=\; [\,t'_j,\ t'_{j+1}\,] \;\subseteq\; [\,t_i,\ t_{i+1}\,] \;=\; I_i ,$$

because $t_i = t'_{\varphi(i)} \le t'_j$ and $t'_{j+1} \le t'_{\varphi(i+1)} = t_{i+1}$.

**The blocks are counted by telescoping.** By clause 5 of
[[lem-finite-sum-laws]],
$\sum_{i<n}\big(\varphi(i+1) - \varphi(i)\big) = \varphi(n) - \varphi(0) = n'$,
so, subtracting $\sum_{i<n} 1 = n$,

$$\sum_{i<n} \big(\varphi(i+1) - \varphi(i) - 1\big) \;=\; n' - n ,$$

a sum of $n$ nonnegative integers, one for each block, which vanishes exactly at
the blocks consisting of a single index. This identity is the whole content of
the quantitative bound in [[lem-refinement-inequalities]], and it is also why
$n \le n'$.

Finally, the lengths inside a block sum to the length of the block:

$$\sum_{j = \varphi(i)}^{\varphi(i+1)-1} \Delta'_j \;=\; t'_{\varphi(i+1)} - t'_{\varphi(i)} \;=\; t_{i+1} - t_i \;=\; \Delta_i \qquad (i < n),$$

again by telescoping, applied to the sequence $l \mapsto t'_{\varphi(i)+l}$ and
read through the index-shift convention of [[def-finite-sum]].

## Remarks

- **Why $a < b$ is a standing hypothesis and not a case.** With $a = b$ the
  displayed chain $a = t_0 < \dots < t_n = b$ is unsatisfiable for $n \ge 1$, and
  admitting $n = 0$ would give a partition with no subintervals, an empty mesh
  set and no maximum. Every statement on this page is about a nondegenerate
  closed bounded interval, and the convention $\int_a^a f := 0$ is not adopted
  here because nothing below needs it.

- **The subintervals overlap at their shared endpoints, and that is harmless.**
  $I_i \cap I_{i+1} = \{t_{i+1}\}$, so the union $\bigcup_{i<n} I_i = [a,b]$ is
  not disjoint. Every quantity attached to a partition below is a sum over $i<n$
  of a number times $\Delta_i$, and a single point contributes length $0$, so no
  statement on this page is sensitive to the double counting of the $n-1$
  interior points.

- **Refinement is a relation between point sets, not between lists.** Defining it
  as "$P'$ is obtained from $P$ by inserting points" would be the same relation,
  by the uniqueness claim above, but it would make every proof carry an
  insertion order. The index map $\varphi$ recovers the list-level picture when
  it is wanted, and it is what [[lem-refinement-inequalities]] actually uses.

## Statement

For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and all $a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n \in \mathbb{R}$, the
set $\{a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ has a maximum and a minimum ([[def-max-min]]).

What is proved below is exactly the displayed statement, by induction on $n$.

The usual reading, that *every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has a
maximum and a minimum*, follows once one identifies the nonempty finite subsets
of $\mathbb{R}$ with the sets listable as $\{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$. That
identification is recorded as a stipulation in the Given below, because this page
has no definition of finiteness to prove it against. **It is discharged, not
merely assumed**: [[lem-finite-subsets-listable]] proves that the two
descriptions of a nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ agree. That lemma is
recorded in `justified_by` rather than in `deps`, since it is about the sets this
lemma quantifies over and therefore depends on this one. This is what licenses
the notation
$\max\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ and $\min\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ for finite sets of
**real** numbers from this page onwards.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Real numbers $a_0, a_1, a_2, \dots$; for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write $F_n := \{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$, so that $F_{n+1} = F_n \cup \{a_{n+1}\}$. A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and finite exactly when it equals $F_n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and some choice of $a_0, \dots, a_n$.

[A1] $P(n)$ denotes the statement: for all $a_0, \dots, a_n \in \mathbb{R}$, the set $F_n$ has a maximum and a minimum.

[L1] Maximum and minimum: $m = \max X$ means $m \in X$ and $x \le m$ for all $x \in X$; $m = \min X$ means $m \in X$ and $m \le x$ for all $x \in X$; each is unique when it exists ([[def-max-min]]).

[L2] Induction principle: if $P(0)$ holds and $P(n)$ implies $P(n+1)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $P(n)$ holds for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, where $n + 1$ denotes the successor $\sigma(n)$ ([[thm-induction-principle]], [[def-nat-addition]]).

[L3] The order on $\mathbb{R}$ is reflexive, total and transitive: $a \le a$; for all $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds, so at least one of $a \le b$ and $b \le a$ holds; and $a \le b$ with $b \le c$ gives $a \le c$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case: $F_0 = \{a_0\}$, and $a_0 \in F_0$ with $a_0 \le a_0$ by reflexivity, so $a_0$ is both a maximum and a minimum of $F_0$; hence $P(0)$ holds. [base, A1, L1, L3]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume $P(n)$, that is, for all reals $a_0, \dots, a_n$ the set $F_n$ has a maximum and a minimum. [ih, A1]

2.1 Let $a_0, \dots, a_{n+1} \in \mathbb{R}$ be arbitrary; by the inductive hypothesis the set $F_n$ has a maximum $M$ and a minimum $m$, and $F_{n+1} = F_n \cup \{a_{n+1}\}$. [step 1.2, L1]

3.1 By totality at least one of $a_{n+1} \le M$ and $M \le a_{n+1}$ holds. If $a_{n+1} \le M$, then $M \in F_n \subseteq F_{n+1}$, every element of $F_n$ is $\le M$ because $M = \max F_n$, and $a_{n+1} \le M$ as well, so $M$ is a maximum of $F_{n+1}$. If $M \le a_{n+1}$, then $a_{n+1} \in F_{n+1}$, every $x \in F_n$ satisfies $x \le M \le a_{n+1}$ hence $x \le a_{n+1}$ by transitivity, and $a_{n+1} \le a_{n+1}$, so $a_{n+1}$ is a maximum of $F_{n+1}$. Either way $F_{n+1}$ has a maximum. [step 2.1, L1, L3]

3.2 Dually, at least one of $m \le a_{n+1}$ and $a_{n+1} \le m$ holds. If $m \le a_{n+1}$, then $m \in F_{n+1}$ and every element of $F_{n+1}$ is $\ge m$, so $m$ is a minimum of $F_{n+1}$. If $a_{n+1} \le m$, then $a_{n+1} \in F_{n+1}$ and every $x \in F_n$ satisfies $a_{n+1} \le m \le x$ hence $a_{n+1} \le x$ by transitivity, so $a_{n+1}$ is a minimum of $F_{n+1}$. Either way $F_{n+1}$ has a minimum. [step 2.1, L1, L3]

4.1 Since $a_0, \dots, a_{n+1}$ were arbitrary, $F_{n+1}$ has a maximum and a minimum for every such list, that is, $P(n)$ implies $P(n+1)$. [step 3.1, step 3.2, A1]

5.1 The base case and the inductive step give $P(n)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ by the induction principle; since a nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is exactly a set of the form $F_n$, every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has both a maximum and a minimum. [step 1.1, step 4.1, given, L2, discharge-induction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the stipulation is discharged.** Finiteness itself is defined later, in [[def-countable]], as equinumerosity with a von Neumann natural; with that definition in hand [[lem-finite-subsets-listable]] proves that a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and finite exactly when it is listable as $\{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$, which is the Given below. So nothing on this page rests on an assumption that is never paid for; it is paid for later, and the payment is recorded in `justified_by`.
- **Only the total order is used, never completeness.** The base case needs reflexivity, the inductive step needs totality and transitivity, and the induction itself runs over $\mathbb{N}$. The same induction works in any totally ordered field; what is recorded here is its specialisation to $\mathbb{R}$.
- Nonemptiness is essential: $\emptyset$ is finite and has no maximum ([[def-max-min]]). Finiteness is essential too: $\{x \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < x < 1\}$ is bounded and has no maximum ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Combined with claim 1 of [[lem-max-is-sup]], this says every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has a supremum, and that the supremum is attained, because it equals the maximum. The infimum half is *not* part of [[lem-max-is-sup]], which speaks only of maxima and suprema; it follows from the minimum proved here together with the reflection identity $\inf X = -\sup(-X)$ ([[lem-reflection]], [[thm-infimum-property]]).

## Statement

Let $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be sequences of reals, let
$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, and let $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, with finite sums and
finite products as in [[def-finite-sum]]. Then:

1. **Additivity.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k$.
2. **Scaling.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k$; in particular $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda = n\lambda$, where $n$ denotes the canonical natural $\iota(n) \in \mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).
3. **Splitting.** If $m \le n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k$, and $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n} a_k = \Big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k\Big)$.
4. **Monotonicity.** If $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$. In particular, if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, every single term satisfies $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$ for $j < n$, and $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ forces $a_k = 0$ for every $k < n$.
5. **Telescoping.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}\big(c_{k+1} - c_k\big) = c_n - c_0$.
6. **Products.** $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k) = \Big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\Big)$; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, and if $a_k > 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k > 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\lambda$, and naturals $m, n$. Write $\Sigma_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\Pi_n = \prod_{k<n} a_k$.

[L1] Recursion clauses ([[def-finite-sum]]): $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ and $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n$; $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1$ and $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) \cdot a_n$; and $\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k = \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j}$ for $m \le n$, likewise for products.

[L2] Field axioms: addition and multiplication are associative and commutative, $0$ and $1$ are the identities, $x - x = 0$, and multiplication distributes over addition ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]); and $0 \cdot x = 0$, which is not an axiom but a lemma ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

[L3] Induction principle: a property holding at $0$ and inherited by successors holds at every natural ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L4] Adding inequalities: $x \le y$ and $u \le v$ imply $x + u \le y + v$. [[lem-of-add-order]] states the STRICT forms and only those ($x < y \Rightarrow x + c < y + c$, and $x < y$ with $u < v$ giving $x + u < y + v$); the nonstrict form used throughout below is those two together with the cases $x = y$ and $u = v$, which are settled by trichotomy, the order being total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] The canonical embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a field homomorphism, so $\iota(0) = 0$ and $\iota(n+1) = \iota(n) + 1$, and $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L6] Sign rules: a product of two positives is positive ([[lem-of-sign-rules]], claim 1), and a product of two nonnegatives is nonnegative, since a factor equal to $0$ makes the product $0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]) and otherwise both factors are positive; and $1 > 0$, which is proved in [[cor-of-one-positive]] and stated by none of the items named above.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 0$: every claim holds at $n = 0$, since both sides of claim 1 are $0 = 0 + 0$, both sides of claim 2 are $0 = \lambda \cdot 0$ and $0 = \iota(0)\lambda$, claim 4 reads $0 \le 0$ with no term to bound and the hypothesis $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ giving nothing to prove, claim 5 reads $0 = c_0 - c_0$, and claim 6 reads $1 = 1 \cdot 1$ with $1 > 0$. [base, L1, L2, L5, L6]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for this $n$ and for all sequences $a, b, c$ and all $\lambda$. [ih]

1.3 Splitting, claim 3, by a separate induction on the number of trailing terms $d = n - m$ with $m$ fixed: for $d = 0$ the claim reads $\sum_{k<m} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + 0$ and $\prod_{k<m} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\big) \cdot 1$, which hold; and if $\sum_{k<m+d} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d} a_{m+j}$, then $\sum_{k<m+d+1} a_k = \sum_{k<m+d} a_k + a_{m+d} = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \big(\sum_{j<d} a_{m+j} + a_{m+d}\big) = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d+1} a_{m+j}$ by associativity, and identically for products with $1$ in place of $0$ and multiplication in place of addition, so induction on $d$ gives claim 3 for every $m \le n$. [L1, L2, L3]

2.1 Additivity at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k\big) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) + \big(\sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n\big) = \sum_{k<n+1} a_k + \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$, using the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of addition. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Scaling at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda a_k = \sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda\big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) = \lambda \sum_{k<n+1} a_k$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and distributivity; taking $a_k = 1$ for all $k$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda = \sum_{k<n} \lambda + \lambda = \iota(n)\lambda + \lambda = (\iota(n) + 1)\lambda = \iota(n+1)\lambda$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L5]

2.3 Monotonicity at $n+1$: assume $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n+1$; then $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$, so the hypothesis gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$, and adding the inequality $a_n \le b_n$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n \le \sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n = \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$. [step 1.2, L1, L4]

2.4 Telescoping at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(c_{k+1} - c_k) = \sum_{k<n}(c_{k+1} - c_k) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = (c_n - c_0) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = c_{n+1} - c_0$, by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and the field identities. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.5 Products at $n+1$: $\prod_{k<n+1}(a_k b_k) = \big(\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k)\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n+1} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n+1} b_k\big)$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of multiplication; and if every $a_k \ge 0$ for $k < n+1$ then $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) a_n$ is a product of two nonnegatives, hence nonnegative, with the same argument giving positivity from positivity since $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1 > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L6]

3.1 Consequences of monotonicity, completing claim 4: monotonicity itself holds at every $n$, by the induction principle applied to the base case of step 1.1 and the successor step 2.3, so it is available for an arbitrary $n$ in what follows; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then comparing with the zero sequence gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge \sum_{k<n} 0 = 0$; for $j < n$ splitting at $j$ and then at $j+1$ writes $\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<j} a_k + a_j + \sum_{k=j+1}^{n-1} a_k$ with the first and third summands $\ge 0$, so $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$; and if moreover $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ then $0 \le a_j \le 0$ for every $j < n$, so $a_j = 0$. [step 1.1, step 2.3, step 1.3, L3, L4, L2]

4.1 By the induction principle claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and claim 3 was proved in step 1.3 with its consequences in step 3.1, so all six laws hold. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, step 2.5, step 1.3, step 3.1, L3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $p \in \mathbb{Q}$ with $p \ge 1$, with the norms
of [[def-p-norms-on-rn]]. Then:

1. $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$ is a norm on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
   ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]).
2. For $n \ge 1$, $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ is a norm on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
3. **The dictionary.** For $n \ge 1$ and all $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$,
   $$\lVert x-y\rVert_1 = d_1(x,y), \qquad \lVert x-y\rVert_2 = d_2(x,y), \qquad \lVert x-y\rVert_\infty = d_\infty(x,y),$$
   where $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_\infty$ are the metrics of the published
   [[lem-metrics-on-rn]]. So the metric induced by each of these three norms
   ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]) **is** the correspondingly named published
   metric, not merely one equivalent to it.

**Consequence, used repeatedly below and stated once here.** By clause 3 at
$p = 2$, the metric space $(\mathbb{R}^{n}, d_2)$ of the published metric-spaces
page and the metric space underlying the normed space
$(\mathbb{R}^{n}, \lVert\cdot\rVert_2)$ of this page are the same object. Hence
completeness ([[thm-euclidean-space-complete]] clause 2), Heine-Borel
([[thm-heine-borel-rn]] clause 2) and the compactness equivalences
([[thm-metric-compactness-equivalences]]) are statements about this page's normed
space, **with their hypothesis $n \ge 1$ inherited unchanged and not weakened**.
Nothing below cites any of those three theorems for $n = 0$.

**Why this lemma exists.** Without it the library would hold a norm-induced
metric on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and a separately published metric on the same set with
no recorded relation, and every later citation would have to guess which was
meant. The proof of clause 3 is a comparison of two written expressions; the
value is that the comparison is made and recorded.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural number $n$, a rational $p \ge 1$, vectors $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ and a real $\lambda$; write $S(x) := \sum_{k<n}|x_k|^{p}$, so that $\lVert x\rVert_p = S(x)^{1/p}$ ([[def-p-norms-on-rn]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[A1] For clauses 2 and 3, $n \ge 1$, so that $\{|x_k| : k<n\}$ is a nonempty finite set of reals ([[def-p-norms-on-rn]], [[lem-metrics-on-rn]]).

[L1] Rational powers ([[def-rational-power]], [[lem-rational-power-laws]]): for $a, b \ge 0$ and rationals $r, s > 0$ one has $a^{r} \ge 0$, $(ab)^{r} = a^{r}b^{r}$, $0^{r} = 0$, and $a^{r} > 0$ when $a > 0$; and for $a > 0$, $(a^{r})^{s} = a^{rs}$ and $a^{1} = a$.

[L2] Monotonicity in the base ([[lem-rational-power-monotone]] clause 2): for a rational $r > 0$ and reals $0 \le a < b$ one has $a^{r} < b^{r}$; hence $a \le b$ implies $a^{r} \le b^{r}$, the case $a = b$ being trivial, and $a^{r} = 0$ only for $a = 0$.

[L3] Laws of finite sums ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[def-finite-sum]]): additivity, scaling, monotonicity; a sum of nonnegative terms is nonnegative, each single term is at most such a sum, and a sum of nonnegative terms that vanishes has every term $0$.

[L4] Minkowski's inequality for finite sums at rational $p \ge 1$ ([[thm-minkowski-finite]]): $\bigl(\sum_{k<n}|a_k+b_k|^{p}\bigr)^{1/p} \le \bigl(\sum_{k<n}|a_k|^{p}\bigr)^{1/p} + \bigl(\sum_{k<n}|b_k|^{p}\bigr)^{1/p}$.

[L5] Absolute value ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]], [[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]): $|t| \ge 0$; $|t| = 0$ exactly when $t = 0$; $|st| = |s|\,|t|$; $|s+t| \le |s|+|t|$; and $|t|^{2} = t^{2}$.

[L6] Maxima ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]): a nonempty finite set of reals has a maximum, the maximum belongs to the set and bounds it above, and a set with an upper bound belonging to it has that element as its maximum.

[L7] Order arithmetic: multiplying an inequality by a nonnegative real preserves it ([[lem-of-sign-rules]] in its strict form, together with the case of equality settled by totality), and $\le$ is transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L8] The norm axioms (N1), (N2), (N3) ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]); $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ agrees with the Euclidean norm of [[def-euclidean-inner-product]], and is a norm by [[thm-cauchy-schwarz-and-the-euclidean-norm]]; square roots are the rational power at exponent $1/2$ ([[thm-of-square-roots]], [[def-p-norms-on-rn]]).

[L9] The published metrics on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n \ge 1$ are $d_1(x,y) = \sum_{k<n}|x_k-y_k|$, $d_2(x,y) = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}(x_k-y_k)^{2}}$ and $d_\infty(x,y) = \max\{|x_k-y_k| : k<n\}$, and each is a metric ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]], [[def-metric-space]], [[def-metric-topology]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Every term $|x_k|^{p}$ is nonnegative, so $S(x) \ge 0$ and $\lVert x\rVert_p = S(x)^{1/p}$ is defined and nonnegative. [L1, L3]

1.2 $S(x) = 0$ holds exactly when $|x_k|^{p} = 0$ for every $k<n$, a vanishing sum of nonnegative terms having every term $0$; and $|x_k|^{p} = 0$ exactly when $|x_k| = 0$, that is exactly when $x_k = 0$. [L1, L2, L3, L5]

1.3 For every $k<n$, $|(\lambda x)_k|^{p} = \bigl(|\lambda|\,|x_k|\bigr)^{p} = |\lambda|^{p}|x_k|^{p}$, so $S(\lambda x) = |\lambda|^{p}S(x)$ by scaling of finite sums. [L1, L3, L5]

1.4 Instantiating [L4] at $a_k := x_k$ and $b_k := y_k$, and using $(x+y)_k = x_k+y_k$, gives $\lVert x+y\rVert_p \le \lVert x\rVert_p + \lVert y\rVert_p$, which is axiom (N3) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$. [L4, L8]

1.5 Under [A1] the set $\{|x_k| : k<n\}$ is nonempty and finite, so $\lVert x\rVert_\infty$ exists, is one of the $|x_k|$, and satisfies $|x_k| \le \lVert x\rVert_\infty$ for every $k<n$; in particular $\lVert x\rVert_\infty \ge 0$. [A1, L5, L6]

1.6 Under [A1], $\lVert x-y\rVert_1 = \sum_{k<n}|x_k-y_k|$ by the case $p=1$ of the definition, and that is the written expression for $d_1(x,y)$. [L1, L9]

1.7 Under [A1], $\lVert x-y\rVert_2 = \bigl(\sum_{k<n}|x_k-y_k|^{2}\bigr)^{1/2} = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}(x_k-y_k)^{2}}$, using $|t|^{2} = t^{2}$ and the identification of the exponent $1/2$ with the nonnegative square root, and that is the written expression for $d_2(x,y)$. [L5, L8, L9]

1.8 Under [A1], $\lVert x-y\rVert_\infty = \max\{|x_k-y_k| : k<n\}$ by definition, and that is the written expression for $d_\infty(x,y)$. [L9]

2.1 $\lVert x\rVert_p = 0$ holds exactly when $S(x) = 0$, since $S(x) > 0$ would give $S(x)^{1/p} > 0$ and $0^{1/p} = 0$. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.2 Under [A1]: $\lVert x\rVert_\infty = 0$ forces $|x_k| \le 0$ and $|x_k| \ge 0$ for every $k<n$, hence $x = 0$; and $\lVert 0\rVert_\infty = 0$. This is (N1) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$. [step 1.5, L5, L8]

2.3 Under [A1]: for every $k<n$, $|(\lambda x)_k| = |\lambda|\,|x_k| \le |\lambda|\,\lVert x\rVert_\infty$, and choosing $j<n$ with $|x_j| = \lVert x\rVert_\infty$ gives $|(\lambda x)_j| = |\lambda|\,\lVert x\rVert_\infty$; so $|\lambda|\lVert x\rVert_\infty$ belongs to the set and bounds it above, whence $\lVert \lambda x\rVert_\infty = |\lambda|\lVert x\rVert_\infty$. This is (N2) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$. [step 1.5, L5, L6, L7]

2.4 Under [A1]: for every $k<n$, $|(x+y)_k| = |x_k+y_k| \le |x_k| + |y_k| \le \lVert x\rVert_\infty + \lVert y\rVert_\infty$; choosing $j<n$ with $|(x+y)_j| = \lVert x+y\rVert_\infty$ gives $\lVert x+y\rVert_\infty \le \lVert x\rVert_\infty + \lVert y\rVert_\infty$, which is (N3) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$. [step 1.5, L5, L6, L7]

3.1 By steps 2.1 and 1.2, $\lVert x\rVert_p = 0$ exactly when $x_k = 0$ for every $k<n$, that is exactly when $x = 0$; this is axiom (N1) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$. [step 2.1, step 1.2, L8]

3.2 Steps 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 are (N1), (N2) and (N3) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ under [A1], so clause 2 holds. [step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, A1, L8]

4.1 If $\lambda = 0$ then $\lambda x = 0$ and both sides of (N2) are $0$ by step 3.1; if $\lambda \ne 0$ then $|\lambda| > 0$, and step 1.3 with the power laws gives $\lVert \lambda x\rVert_p = \bigl(|\lambda|^{p}S(x)\bigr)^{1/p} = \bigl(|\lambda|^{p}\bigr)^{1/p}S(x)^{1/p} = |\lambda|^{p\cdot(1/p)}\lVert x\rVert_p = |\lambda|\,\lVert x\rVert_p$; this is axiom (N2). [step 1.3, step 3.1, L1, L5, L8]

5.1 Steps 3.1, 4.1 and 1.4 are (N1), (N2) and (N3) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$, so clause 1 holds. [step 1.4, step 3.1, step 4.1, L8]

6.1 Steps 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8 give clause 3, and with steps 5.1 and 3.2 all three clauses are proved; in particular the metric induced by $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n \ge 1$ is the published $d_2$, which is the consequence recorded in the Statement. [step 5.1, step 3.2, step 1.6, step 1.7, step 1.8, L9] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the consequence does and does not license.** Because the two metric spaces are literally the same, a published theorem about $(\mathbb{R}^{n}, d_2)$ may be quoted here verbatim. It may **not** be quoted with a weaker hypothesis: [[thm-euclidean-space-complete]], [[thm-heine-borel-rn]] and [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] are all stated for $n \ge 1$ only, because $d_\infty$ is a maximum over an empty index set at $n = 0$, and every item on this page that uses one of them carries $n \ge 1$ in its own statement.

- **Clause 1 holds at $n = 0$ and clause 2 does not apply there.** At $n = 0$ every $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$ is the zero function on the one-element space $\mathbb{R}^{0}$, which is the unique norm on the zero space ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]); $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ is not defined there at all.

- **The route to (N3) differs between the two families, and that is not an accident.** For $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$ the triangle inequality is Minkowski's inequality, a genuine theorem about rational powers; for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ it is the elementary argument of step 2.4, that a maximum of sums is at most the sum of the maxima. The second argument is the one that needs a nonempty index set.

## Statement

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. If $0 \in S$ and $\sigma(n) \in S$ whenever $n \in S$, then $S = \mathbb{N}$. Equivalently (property form): if a property $P$ satisfies $P(0)$ and ($P(n) \Rightarrow P(\sigma(n))$) for all $n$, then $P(n)$ holds for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. This is the induction principle, the basis of proof by induction.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $\mathbb{N} = \omega$ is the smallest inductive set ([[def-inductive-set]], [[def-natural-numbers]], [[lem-omega-smallest-inductive]]); $0 = \varnothing$, $\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$.

[L1] $\omega$ is contained in every inductive set ([[lem-omega-smallest-inductive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Suppose $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ with $0 = \varnothing \in S$ and ($x \in S \Rightarrow \sigma(x) = x \cup \{x\} \in S$). [given]

2.1 Then $S$ contains $\varnothing$ and is closed under $x \mapsto x \cup \{x\}$, so $S$ is an inductive set. [step 1.1]

3.1 $\mathbb{N} = \omega \subseteq S$ because $\omega$ is a subset of every inductive set. [L1, step 2.1]

4.1 With $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ by hypothesis, $S = \mathbb{N}$. [step 3.1, given]

5.1 The property form is the set case with $S = \{n \in \mathbb{N} : P(n)\}$: $P(0)$ and $P(n) \Rightarrow P(\sigma(n))$ give $0 \in S$ and $\sigma$-closure, so $S = \mathbb{N}$, i.e. $P$ holds for all $n$; conversely the set form is the property form applied to $P(n) :\equiv n \in S$, so the two are equivalent. [step 4.1] ∎
