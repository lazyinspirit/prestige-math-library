You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as
an independent adversarial proof-refuter. Return evidence only; Audit-Alpha
alone adjudicates and edits.

## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` Statement or consumer, actively search for a
counterexample or a failure in the witness or cited generated premise. A false
public claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or
materially inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is
nonfatal.

Return no more than 450 words, exactly in this shape:

## Statement

Let $a<b$ be reals. Suppose every $f_k:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$ is Riemann
integrable and $f_k\to f$ uniformly on $[a,b]$. Then $f$ is Riemann
integrable and

$$\int_a^b f_k\longrightarrow\int_a^b f.$$

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a<b$, integrable functions $f_k:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$, and uniform convergence $f_k\to f$.

[A1] Uniform convergence means that for every real $\eta>0$ one index makes $|f_k(x)-f(x)|<\eta$ for every later $k$ and every $x\in[a,b]$ ([[def-pointwise-uniform-and-uniformly-cauchy-convergence]]).

[L1] An integrable function on $[a,b]$ is bounded; conversely, a bounded function $h$ there is Riemann integrable exactly when, for every real $\varepsilon>0$, some partition $P$ satisfies $U(h,P)-L(h,P)<\varepsilon$ ([[def-darboux-integral]], [[thm-riemann-criterion]]).

[L2] Darboux upper and lower sums are finite sums of the subinterval suprema and infima times the subinterval lengths; finite sums preserve inequalities and split and telescope in the usual way ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L3] If two integrable functions differ by at most $\eta$ uniformly, then their integrals differ by at most $\eta(b-a)$ ([[lem-uniform-integral-error-bound]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $\varepsilon>0$ be real, put $\eta:=\varepsilon/(4(b-a))>0$, and choose an index $j$ such that $|f_j(x)-f(x)|<\eta$ for every $x\in[a,b]$. [A1, choose]

1.2 By integrability of $f_j$ and [L1], choose a partition $P$ with $U(f_j,P)-L(f_j,P)<\varepsilon/2$. [L1, choose]

2.1 The integrable function $f_j$ is bounded, say $|f_j(x)|\le M$ on $[a,b]$; then $|f(x)|\le M+\eta$, so $f$ is bounded. [step 1.1, L1, algebra]

3.1 On each subinterval of $P$, step 1.1 gives $\sup f\le\sup f_j+\eta$ and $\inf f\ge\inf f_j-\eta$; these suprema and infima exist by step 2.1. Multiplying by the nonnegative subinterval lengths and summing gives $U(f,P)\le U(f_j,P)+\eta(b-a)$ and $L(f,P)\ge L(f_j,P)-\eta(b-a)$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.1, L2, algebra]

4.1 Therefore $U(f,P)-L(f,P)\le U(f_j,P)-L(f_j,P)+2\eta(b-a)<\varepsilon$, so [L1] makes $f$ integrable. [step 3.1, L1, algebra]

5.1 Now let $\varepsilon>0$ be real and choose $N$ such that $|f_k(x)-f(x)|<\varepsilon/(b-a+1)$ for every $k\ge N$ and every $x\in[a,b]$. [step 4.1, A1, choose]

6.1 For $k\ge N$, both functions are integrable, so [L3] gives $\left|\int_a^b f_k-\int_a^b f\right|\le \varepsilon(b-a)/(b-a+1)<\varepsilon$. [step 4.1, step 5.1, L3, algebra]

7.1 Step 6.1 proves $\int_a^b f_k\to\int_a^b f$, while step 4.1 proves integrability of $f$. [step 4.1, step 6.1] ∎

The sequence $(f_k)$ **converges pointwise** to $f$ on $X$ when, for every $x \\in X$, the real sequence $(f_k(x))$ converges to $f(x)$ ([[def-real-limit]]). Thus the index after which $|f_k(x)-f(x)|<\\varepsilon$ may depend on both $\\varepsilon$ and $x$. The sequence $(f_k)$ **converges uniformly** to $f$ on $X$ when $$(\\forall \\varepsilon>0)(\\exists N\\in\\mathbb{N})(\\forall k\\ge N)(\\forall x\\in X)\\quad |f_k(x)-f(x)|<\\varepsilon,$$ where $\\varepsilon$ ranges over the positive reals.

So $\\mathcal{L}$ and $\\mathcal{U}$ are nonempty. **$\\mathcal{L}$ is bounded above and $\\mathcal{U}$ is bounded below.** Fix any $Q \\in \\mathcal{P}$. By claim 2 of [[lem-refinement-inequalities]], $L(f,P) \\le U(f,Q)$ for every $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$, so $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound of $\\mathcal{L}$; and $L(f,Q) \\le U(f,P)$ for every $P$, so $L(f,Q)$ is a lower bound of $\\mathcal{U}$. Hence a nonempty set bounded above has a supremum ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and a nonempty set bounded below has an infimum ([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]), each unique ([[lem-sup-unique]]). The **lower** and **upper Darboux integrals** of $f$ over $[a,b]$ are the real numbers $$\\underline{\\int_a^b} f \\;:=\\; \\sup \\mathcal{L} \\;=\\; \\sup_{P} L(f,P), \\qquad \\overline{\\int_a^b} f \\;:=\\; \\inf \\mathcal{U} \\;=\\; \\inf_{P} U(f,P) .$$ ### The lower integral never exceeds the upper one $$\\underline{\\int_a^b} f \\;\\le\\; \\overline{\\int_a^b} f .$$ Indeed, for each fixed $Q \\in \\mathcal{P}$ the number $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound of $\\mathcal{L}$, so the least upper bound satisfies $\\underline{\\int_a^b} f \\le U(f,Q)$. As $Q$ was arbitrary, $\\underline{\\int_a^b}f$ is a lower bound of $\\mathcal{U}$, and the greatest lower bound satisfies $\\underline{\\int_a^b} f \\le \\overline{\\int_a^b} f$ ([[def-infimum]]). Moreover, for **every** partition $P$, $$L(f,P) \\;\\le\\; \\underline{\\int_a^b} f \\;\\le\\; \\overline{\\int_a^b} f \\;\\le\\; U(f,P) ,$$ the outer inequalities because a member of a set is at most its supremum and at least its infimum. ### Integrability $f$ is **Darboux integrable on $[a,b]$**, and on this page simply **integrable**, when $$\\underline{\\int_a^b} f \\;=\\; \\overline{\\int_a^b} f ,$$ and then the common value is written $$\\int_a^b f \\qquad \\text{or} \\qquad \\int_a^b f(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x ,$$ the **integral of $f$ over $[a,b]$**. It is a single well-determined real number, being the common value of two numbers each of which is unique ([[lem-sup-unique]]). Without the displayed equality the symbol $\\int_a^b f$ is not defined and is never written. **The inequality above is the whole difficulty.** By the previous paragraph integrability is *never* a question of one integral exceeding the other, only of the gap $\\overline{\\int_a^b} f - \\underline{\\int_a^b} f \\ge 0$ being $0$; and by [[thm-riemann-criterion]] that gap is $0$ exactly when a single partition can be found making $U(f,P) - L(f,P)$ small. Whether that is possible is settled completely, in terms of the discontinuities of $f$, by [[thm-lebesgue-criterion]]. **\"Riemann integrable\" means the same thing here.** The definition above is Darboux's. Riemann's own definition, in terms of tagged partitions of small mesh, is [[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]], and the two define the same class of functions with the same integral by [[thm-darboux-equals-riemann]]. Until that theorem is proved the two phrases are kept apart; after it they are used interchangeably, as they are throughout the literature.",

In particular $m_i \\le M_i$ and $M_i - m_i \\le 2M$. The dependence of $m_i$ and $M_i$ on $f$ and on $P$ is suppressed in the notation, as is customary; where two partitions are in play the sums below carry the partition and the extreme values are written out. ### The two Darboux sums $$L(f,P) \\;:=\\; \\sum_{i<n} m_i \\,\\Delta_i, \\qquad U(f,P) \\;:=\\; \\sum_{i<n} M_i \\,\\Delta_i ,$$ the finite sums of [[def-finite-sum]], indexed by $i \\in \\mathbb{N}$ with $i < n$. Both are real numbers, being finite sums of reals, and $$L(f,P) \\;\\le\\; U(f,P) ,$$ by monotonicity of finite sums, clause 4 of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], since $m_i \\Delta_i \\le M_i \\Delta_i$ for every $i < n$: multiplying $m_i \\le M_i$ by $\\Delta_i > 0$ preserves the inequality ([[def-ordered-field]]). ### The gap on a subinterval is the oscillation there For every $i < n$, $$M_i - m_i \\;=\\; \\omega_f(I_i) \\;=\\; \\sup\\{\\, |f(x) - f(y)| \\ : \\ x, y \\in I_i \\,\\} ,$$ the oscillation of $f$ on the set $I_i$ ([[def-oscillation]]). The supremum is a real number here rather than an extended one, because $f$ is bounded ([[def-oscillation]], [[def-extended-reals]]). The identity is proved in two inequalities. *The oscillation is at most the gap.* For $x, y \\in I_i$ both $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ lie in $[m_i, M_i]$, so $f(x) - f(y) \\le M_i - m_i$ and $f(y) - f(x) \\le M_i - m_i$, whence $|f(x) - f(y)| \\le M_i - m_i$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]). So $M_i - m_i$ is an upper bound of the set whose supremum is $\\omega_f(I_i)$. *The gap is at most the oscillation.* Let $\\varepsilon > 0$ be real. By the $\\varepsilon$-characterisations of the supremum and the infimum ([[lem-sup-epsilon]], [[lem-inf-epsilon]]) there are $x, y \\in I_i$ with $f(x) > M_i - \\varepsilon/2$ and $f(y) < m_i + \\varepsilon/2$; then $$|f(x) - f(y)| \\;\\ge\\; f(x) - f(y) \\;>\\; (M_i - m_i) - \\varepsilon ,$$ so $\\omega_f(I_i) > (M_i - m_i) - \\varepsilon$. As $\\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary, $\\omega_f(I_i) \\ge M_i - m_i$: otherwise $\\varepsilon := (M_i - m_i) - \\omega_f(I_i)$ would be positive and give $\\omega_f(I_i) > \\omega_f(I_i)$. This identity is what connects the Darboux machinery to the pointwise oscillation of [[def-oscillation]], and it is the hinge of [[thm-lebesgue-criterion]].",

## Definition

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]). Write $\mathcal{P}$ for the set of all partitions of
$[a,b]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]) and put

$$\mathcal{L} \;:=\; \{\, L(f,P) \ : \ P \in \mathcal{P} \,\}, \qquad \mathcal{U} \;:=\; \{\, U(f,P) \ : \ P \in \mathcal{P} \,\}$$

for the sets of lower and of upper Darboux sums ([[def-darboux-sums]]).

### Both extrema exist

**$\mathcal{P}$ is nonempty**: the pair $(1, t)$ with $t_0 := a$ and $t_k := b$
for $k \ge 1$ is a partition of $[a,b]$, since $a < b$. So $\mathcal{L}$ and
$\mathcal{U}$ are nonempty.

**$\mathcal{L}$ is bounded above and $\mathcal{U}$ is bounded below.** Fix any
$Q \in \mathcal{P}$. By claim 2 of [[lem-refinement-inequalities]],
$L(f,P) \le U(f,Q)$ for every $P \in \mathcal{P}$, so $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound
of $\mathcal{L}$; and $L(f,Q) \le U(f,P)$ for every $P$, so $L(f,Q)$ is a lower
bound of $\mathcal{U}$.

Hence a nonempty set bounded above has a supremum
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and a nonempty set bounded below has an infimum
([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]), each unique ([[lem-sup-unique]]).
The **lower** and **upper Darboux integrals** of $f$ over $[a,b]$ are the real
numbers

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;:=\; \sup \mathcal{L} \;=\; \sup_{P} L(f,P), \qquad \overline{\int_a^b} f \;:=\; \inf \mathcal{U} \;=\; \inf_{P} U(f,P) .$$

### The lower integral never exceeds the upper one

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f .$$

Indeed, for each fixed $Q \in \mathcal{P}$ the number $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound
of $\mathcal{L}$, so the least upper bound satisfies
$\underline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,Q)$. As $Q$ was arbitrary, $\underline{\int_a^b}f$
is a lower bound of $\mathcal{U}$, and the greatest lower bound satisfies
$\underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f$ ([[def-infimum]]).

Moreover, for **every** partition $P$,

$$L(f,P) \;\le\; \underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; U(f,P) ,$$

the outer inequalities because a member of a set is at most its supremum and at
least its infimum.

### Integrability

$f$ is **Darboux integrable on $[a,b]$**, and on this page simply
**integrable**, when

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;=\; \overline{\int_a^b} f ,$$

and then the common value is written

$$\int_a^b f \qquad \text{or} \qquad \int_a^b f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x ,$$

the **integral of $f$ over $[a,b]$**. It is a single well-determined real
number, being the common value of two numbers each of which is unique
([[lem-sup-unique]]). Without the displayed equality the symbol $\int_a^b f$ is
not defined and is never written.

**The inequality above is the whole difficulty.** By the previous paragraph
integrability is *never* a question of one integral exceeding the other, only of
the gap $\overline{\int_a^b} f - \underline{\int_a^b} f \ge 0$ being $0$; and by
[[thm-riemann-criterion]] that gap is $0$ exactly when a single partition can be
found making $U(f,P) - L(f,P)$ small. Whether that is possible is settled
completely, in terms of the discontinuities of $f$, by
[[thm-lebesgue-criterion]].

**"Riemann integrable" means the same thing here.** The definition above is
Darboux's. Riemann's own definition, in terms of tagged partitions of small
mesh, is [[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]], and the two define the same
class of functions with the same integral by [[thm-darboux-equals-riemann]].
Until that theorem is proved the two phrases are kept apart; after it they are
used interchangeably, as they are throughout the literature.

## Remarks

- **The supremum is over all partitions, and nothing is selected.** Both
  $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{U}$ are sets determined by $f$ and $[a,b]$ alone,
  and $\sup$ and $\inf$ are canonical, so no choice principle is involved in
  forming either integral. Where a choice does enter on this page is recorded in
  [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].

- **Why the lower integral is a supremum and not an infimum.** Refining a
  partition can only increase a lower sum and decrease an upper sum
  ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]]), so the lower sums push up towards the
  integral and the upper sums push down towards it. Taking $\inf \mathcal{L}$
  would return the sum over the coarsest partition and would carry no
  information about $f$ beyond its infimum on $[a,b]$.

- **A bounded $f$ always has both integrals; only their equality can fail.** The
  Dirichlet function on $[0,1]$ has lower integral $0$ and upper integral $1$
  ([[fs-bounded-implies-riemann-integrable]]), which is the standard witness that
  the definition above is not vacuous in either direction.

## Definition

Let $a < b$ be reals, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be **bounded**
([[def-bounded-set]]), so that there is a real $M \ge 0$ with $|f(x)| \le M$ for
every $x \in [a,b]$, and let $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ with
subintervals $I_i = [t_i, t_{i+1}]$ and lengths $\Delta_i = t_{i+1} - t_i$ for
$i < n$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

### The two extreme values on a subinterval

For $i < n$ put

$$m_i \;:=\; \inf f[I_i], \qquad M_i \;:=\; \sup f[I_i], \qquad f[I_i] \;=\; \{\, f(x) : x \in I_i \,\} .$$

**Both exist.** The set $f[I_i]$ is nonempty, because $t_i < t_{i+1}$ makes $I_i$
nonempty ([[def-interval]]), and it is bounded, because $|f(x)| \le M$ for every
$x$ ([[def-bounded-set]]). A nonempty set bounded above has a supremum
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and a nonempty set bounded below has an infimum
([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]); each is unique, so the notations
$\inf f[I_i]$ and $\sup f[I_i]$ name single real numbers ([[lem-sup-unique]]).

**They bracket the values, and each other.** For $x \in I_i$,

$$-M \;\le\; m_i \;\le\; f(x) \;\le\; M_i \;\le\; M ,$$

the outer inequalities because $-M$ is a lower bound and $M$ an upper bound of
$f[I_i]$, and the middle ones by the definitions of infimum and supremum. In
particular $m_i \le M_i$ and $M_i - m_i \le 2M$.

The dependence of $m_i$ and $M_i$ on $f$ and on $P$ is suppressed in the
notation, as is customary; where two partitions are in play the sums below carry
the partition and the extreme values are written out.

### The two Darboux sums

$$L(f,P) \;:=\; \sum_{i<n} m_i \,\Delta_i, \qquad U(f,P) \;:=\; \sum_{i<n} M_i \,\Delta_i ,$$

the finite sums of [[def-finite-sum]], indexed by $i \in \mathbb{N}$ with
$i < n$. Both are real numbers, being finite sums of reals, and

$$L(f,P) \;\le\; U(f,P) ,$$

by monotonicity of finite sums, clause 4 of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], since
$m_i \Delta_i \le M_i \Delta_i$ for every $i < n$: multiplying $m_i \le M_i$ by
$\Delta_i > 0$ preserves the inequality ([[def-ordered-field]]).

### The gap on a subinterval is the oscillation there

For every $i < n$,

$$M_i - m_i \;=\; \omega_f(I_i) \;=\; \sup\{\, |f(x) - f(y)| \ : \ x, y \in I_i \,\} ,$$

the oscillation of $f$ on the set $I_i$ ([[def-oscillation]]). The supremum is a
real number here rather than an extended one, because $f$ is bounded
([[def-oscillation]], [[def-extended-reals]]). The identity is proved in two
inequalities.

*The oscillation is at most the gap.* For $x, y \in I_i$ both $f(x)$ and $f(y)$
lie in $[m_i, M_i]$, so $f(x) - f(y) \le M_i - m_i$ and
$f(y) - f(x) \le M_i - m_i$, whence $|f(x) - f(y)| \le M_i - m_i$
([[lem-of-abs-value]]). So $M_i - m_i$ is an upper bound of the set whose
supremum is $\omega_f(I_i)$.

*The gap is at most the oscillation.* Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real. By the
$\varepsilon$-characterisations of the supremum and the infimum
([[lem-sup-epsilon]], [[lem-inf-epsilon]]) there are $x, y \in I_i$ with
$f(x) > M_i - \varepsilon/2$ and $f(y) < m_i + \varepsilon/2$; then

$$|f(x) - f(y)| \;\ge\; f(x) - f(y) \;>\; (M_i - m_i) - \varepsilon ,$$

so $\omega_f(I_i) > (M_i - m_i) - \varepsilon$. As $\varepsilon > 0$ was
arbitrary, $\omega_f(I_i) \ge M_i - m_i$: otherwise
$\varepsilon := (M_i - m_i) - \omega_f(I_i)$ would be positive and give
$\omega_f(I_i) > \omega_f(I_i)$.

This identity is what connects the Darboux machinery to the pointwise
oscillation of [[def-oscillation]], and it is the hinge of
[[thm-lebesgue-criterion]].

## Remarks

- **Boundedness is a hypothesis of the definition, not of the theorems.** Without
  it $f[I_i]$ may fail to have a supremum in $\mathbb{R}$ and $U(f,P)$ is not
  defined at all. Every statement on this page that mentions $L$ or $U$ therefore
  carries "bounded $f$" in its hypotheses, and none of them is a restriction that
  could be lifted: an unbounded function has no Darboux sums to compare.

- **Why the infimum and the supremum, and not a value of $f$.** Replacing $m_i$
  by $f(\xi_i)$ for a point $\xi_i \in I_i$ gives the Riemann sums of
  [[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]], which depend on a choice of points
  and are not extremal. The Darboux sums are canonical functions of $f$ and $P$
  alone, which is what makes the supremum and infimum over all partitions in
  [[def-darboux-integral]] well posed without any selection.

- **The empty sum does not occur.** A partition has $n \ge 1$
  ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]), so $L(f,P)$ and $U(f,P)$ are sums of at
  least one term. The first term is $m_0 \Delta_0$, over the subinterval
  $[a, t_1]$; the indexing starts at $i = 0$ throughout this page.

## Definition

Let $X$ be a set and, for each $k \in \mathbb{N}$, let
$f_k : X \to \mathbb{R}$ be a real-valued function
([[def-function-space]]). Let $f : X \to \mathbb{R}$.

The sequence $(f_k)$ **converges pointwise** to $f$ on $X$ when, for every
$x \in X$, the real sequence $(f_k(x))$ converges to $f(x)$
([[def-real-limit]]). Thus the index after which
$|f_k(x)-f(x)|<\varepsilon$ may depend on both $\varepsilon$ and $x$.

The sequence $(f_k)$ **converges uniformly** to $f$ on $X$ when

$$(\forall \varepsilon>0)(\exists N\in\mathbb{N})(\forall k\ge N)(\forall x\in X)\quad |f_k(x)-f(x)|<\varepsilon,$$

where $\varepsilon$ ranges over the positive reals. Here one index $N$ serves
every point of $X$.

The sequence $(f_k)$ is **uniformly Cauchy** on $X$ when

$$(\forall \varepsilon>0)(\exists N\in\mathbb{N})(\forall m,n\ge N)(\forall x\in X)\quad |f_m(x)-f_n(x)|<\varepsilon.$$

For each of the three notions above, restricting the error to positive
rationals gives an equivalent condition. The real-error condition immediately
implies the rational-error condition. Conversely, given a real $\eta>0$,
choose $n\ge1$ with $1/n<\eta$ by
[[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]]; the condition for the positive rational
$1/n$ implies the condition for $\eta$. The real-error form is used because
it makes the uniform quantifiers transparent.

## Statement

Let $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be sequences of reals, let
$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, and let $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, with finite sums and
finite products as in [[def-finite-sum]]. Then:

1. **Additivity.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k$.
2. **Scaling.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k$; in particular $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda = n\lambda$, where $n$ denotes the canonical natural $\iota(n) \in \mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).
3. **Splitting.** If $m \le n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k$, and $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n} a_k = \Big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k\Big)$.
4. **Monotonicity.** If $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$. In particular, if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, every single term satisfies $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$ for $j < n$, and $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ forces $a_k = 0$ for every $k < n$.
5. **Telescoping.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}\big(c_{k+1} - c_k\big) = c_n - c_0$.
6. **Products.** $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k) = \Big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\Big)$; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, and if $a_k > 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k > 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\lambda$, and naturals $m, n$. Write $\Sigma_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\Pi_n = \prod_{k<n} a_k$.

[L1] Recursion clauses ([[def-finite-sum]]): $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ and $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n$; $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1$ and $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) \cdot a_n$; and $\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k = \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j}$ for $m \le n$, likewise for products.

[L2] Field axioms: addition and multiplication are associative and commutative, $0$ and $1$ are the identities, $x - x = 0$, and multiplication distributes over addition ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]); and $0 \cdot x = 0$, which is not an axiom but a lemma ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

[L3] Induction principle: a property holding at $0$ and inherited by successors holds at every natural ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L4] Adding inequalities: $x \le y$ and $u \le v$ imply $x + u \le y + v$. [[lem-of-add-order]] states the STRICT forms and only those ($x < y \Rightarrow x + c < y + c$, and $x < y$ with $u < v$ giving $x + u < y + v$); the nonstrict form used throughout below is those two together with the cases $x = y$ and $u = v$, which are settled by trichotomy, the order being total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] The canonical embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a field homomorphism, so $\iota(0) = 0$ and $\iota(n+1) = \iota(n) + 1$, and $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L6] Sign rules: a product of two positives is positive ([[lem-of-sign-rules]], claim 1), and a product of two nonnegatives is nonnegative, since a factor equal to $0$ makes the product $0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]) and otherwise both factors are positive; and $1 > 0$, which is proved in [[cor-of-one-positive]] and stated by none of the items named above.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 0$: every claim holds at $n = 0$, since both sides of claim 1 are $0 = 0 + 0$, both sides of claim 2 are $0 = \lambda \cdot 0$ and $0 = \iota(0)\lambda$, claim 4 reads $0 \le 0$ with no term to bound and the hypothesis $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ giving nothing to prove, claim 5 reads $0 = c_0 - c_0$, and claim 6 reads $1 = 1 \cdot 1$ with $1 > 0$. [base, L1, L2, L5, L6]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for this $n$ and for all sequences $a, b, c$ and all $\lambda$. [ih]

1.3 Splitting, claim 3, by a separate induction on the number of trailing terms $d = n - m$ with $m$ fixed: for $d = 0$ the claim reads $\sum_{k<m} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + 0$ and $\prod_{k<m} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\big) \cdot 1$, which hold; and if $\sum_{k<m+d} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d} a_{m+j}$, then $\sum_{k<m+d+1} a_k = \sum_{k<m+d} a_k + a_{m+d} = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \big(\sum_{j<d} a_{m+j} + a_{m+d}\big) = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d+1} a_{m+j}$ by associativity, and identically for products with $1$ in place of $0$ and multiplication in place of addition, so induction on $d$ gives claim 3 for every $m \le n$. [L1, L2, L3]

2.1 Additivity at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k\big) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) + \big(\sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n\big) = \sum_{k<n+1} a_k + \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$, using the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of addition. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Scaling at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda a_k = \sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda\big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) = \lambda \sum_{k<n+1} a_k$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and distributivity; taking $a_k = 1$ for all $k$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda = \sum_{k<n} \lambda + \lambda = \iota(n)\lambda + \lambda = (\iota(n) + 1)\lambda = \iota(n+1)\lambda$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L5]

2.3 Monotonicity at $n+1$: assume $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n+1$; then $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$, so the hypothesis gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$, and adding the inequality $a_n \le b_n$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n \le \sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n = \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$. [step 1.2, L1, L4]

2.4 Telescoping at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(c_{k+1} - c_k) = \sum_{k<n}(c_{k+1} - c_k) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = (c_n - c_0) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = c_{n+1} - c_0$, by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and the field identities. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.5 Products at $n+1$: $\prod_{k<n+1}(a_k b_k) = \big(\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k)\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n+1} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n+1} b_k\big)$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of multiplication; and if every $a_k \ge 0$ for $k < n+1$ then $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) a_n$ is a product of two nonnegatives, hence nonnegative, with the same argument giving positivity from positivity since $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1 > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L6]

3.1 Consequences of monotonicity, completing claim 4: monotonicity itself holds at every $n$, by the induction principle applied to the base case of step 1.1 and the successor step 2.3, so it is available for an arbitrary $n$ in what follows; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then comparing with the zero sequence gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge \sum_{k<n} 0 = 0$; for $j < n$ splitting at $j$ and then at $j+1$ writes $\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<j} a_k + a_j + \sum_{k=j+1}^{n-1} a_k$ with the first and third summands $\ge 0$, so $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$; and if moreover $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ then $0 \le a_j \le 0$ for every $j < n$, so $a_j = 0$. [step 1.1, step 2.3, step 1.3, L3, L4, L2]

4.1 By the induction principle claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and claim 3 was proved in step 1.3 with its consequences in step 3.1, so all six laws hold. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, step 2.5, step 1.3, step 3.1, L3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $u,v\in\mathbb{R}$, and let $f$ and $g$ be integrable between $u$ and $v$.
If $\eta\ge0$ and

$$|f(x)-g(x)|\le\eta$$

throughout the closed interval with endpoints $u$ and $v$, then

$$\left|\int_u^v f-\int_u^v g\right|\le \eta\,|v-u|.$$

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $u,v$, functions $f,g$ integrable between them, and a real $\eta\ge0$ with $|f-g|\le\eta$ on the interval between them.

[L1] Linear combinations of integrable functions are integrable and their integrals are the corresponding linear combinations, including for oriented limits ([[thm-linearity-of-the-integral]], [[def-oriented-integral]]).

[L2] If $a<b$, an integrable function $h$ satisfying $m\le h(x)\le M$ on $[a,b]$ has $m(b-a)\le\int_a^b h\le M(b-a)$ ([[thm-monotonicity-of-the-integral]]).

[L3] For every real $z$, $-|z|\le z\le|z|$ and $|-z|=|z|$; for $c>0$, $|z|<c$ exactly when $-c<z<c$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 If $u=v$, both oriented integrals are $0$ and the asserted inequality holds. [L1, algebra]

1.2 Suppose $u<v$ and put $h:=f-g$. Then $h$ is integrable and $\int_u^v h=\int_u^v f-\int_u^v g$. [L1]

2.1 The hypothesis gives $|h(x)|\le\eta$, while [L3] gives $-|h(x)|\le h(x)\le|h(x)|$; hence $-\eta\le h(x)\le\eta$ on $[u,v]$, and [L2] gives $-\eta(v-u)\le\int_u^v h\le\eta(v-u)$. [step 1.2, L2, L3]

3.1 Hence $\left|\int_u^v f-\int_u^v g\right|=\left|\int_u^v h\right|\le\eta(v-u)$ when $u<v$. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L3]

4.1 If $u>v$, apply step 3.1 to the ordered pair $(v,u)$ and use antisymmetry of oriented integrals; the same bound results because $|u-v|=|v-u|$. [step 3.1, L1, L3]

5.1 The alternatives $u=v$, $u<v$, and $u>v$ are exhaustive, and steps 1.1, 3.1, and 4.1 give the claimed inequality. [step 1.1, step 3.1, step 4.1] ∎

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]). Then $f$ is Darboux integrable on $[a,b]$
([[def-darboux-integral]]) **if and only if**

$$\text{for every real } \varepsilon > 0 \text{ there is a partition } P \text{ of } [a,b] \text{ with } U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$$

([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

**This is the criterion every later integrability proof on this page uses.** It
replaces a statement about a supremum and an infimum over all partitions, which
cannot be checked directly, by the exhibition of a **single** partition for each
$\varepsilon$. The criterion says nothing about the value of the integral; that
is located separately, by [[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]], between $L(f,P)$
and $U(f,P)$ for the same $P$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and a bounded $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$.

[A1] The criterion: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a partition $P$ of $[a,b]$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$.

[L1] $L(f,P) \le \underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,P)$ for every partition $P$; $\underline{\int_a^b} f = \sup \mathcal{L}$ and $\overline{\int_a^b} f = \inf \mathcal{U}$ over the nonempty sets $\mathcal{L}$ of lower sums and $\mathcal{U}$ of upper sums; $f$ is integrable exactly when the two are equal ([[def-darboux-integral]], [[def-darboux-sums]]).

[L2] $\varepsilon$-characterisation of the supremum: if $u = \sup S$ with $S$ nonempty then for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $s \in S$ with $s > u - \varepsilon$ ([[lem-sup-epsilon]]). Dually, if $\ell = \inf S$ then for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $s \in S$ with $s < \ell + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-inf-epsilon]], [[def-infimum]]).

[L3] If $P'$ refines $P$ then $L(f,P) \le L(f,P')$ and $U(f,P') \le U(f,P)$; the common refinement $P_1 \vee P_2$ refines both $P_1$ and $P_2$ ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L4] Ordered-field arithmetic: adding a constant to both sides preserves an inequality, the order is total and transitive, and $t \cdot 2^{-1} > 0$ for $t > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Write $D := \overline{\int_a^b} f - \underline{\int_a^b} f$, a real number with $D \ge 0$ by [L1]; $f$ is integrable exactly when $D = 0$. [L1]

1.2 **The criterion is sufficient.** Assume [A1] and let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. Fix a partition $P$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$. By [L1], $\underline{\int_a^b} f \ge L(f,P)$ and $\overline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,P)$, so $D \le U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$. [A1, L1, L4, choose]

1.3 **The criterion is necessary; this half of the proof is steps 1.3, 2.2 and 3.1, and its symbols are its own.** Assume $f$ is integrable and write $I$ for the common value $\underline{\int_a^b} f = \overline{\int_a^b} f$. Let a real $\eta > 0$ be given; then $\eta \cdot 2^{-1} > 0$ by [L4]. [L1, L4]

2.1 So $0 \le D < \varepsilon$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$. If $D > 0$, taking $\varepsilon := D$ gives $D < D$, which is false; hence $D = 0$ and $f$ is integrable by step 1.1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L4]

2.2 By [L2] applied to $\mathcal{L}$, whose supremum is $I$, there is a partition $P_1$ with $L(f,P_1) > I - \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$; by [L2] applied to $\mathcal{U}$, whose infimum is $I$, there is a partition $P_2$ with $U(f,P_2) < I + \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$. [step 1.3, L1, L2, choose]

3.1 Put $P_{\ast} := P_1 \vee P_2$, which refines both by [L3]. Then $L(f,P_{\ast}) \ge L(f,P_1) > I - \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$ and $U(f,P_{\ast}) \le U(f,P_2) < I + \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$, so $U(f,P_{\ast}) - L(f,P_{\ast}) < \eta$ by [L4]. Since $\eta > 0$ was arbitrary, the criterion holds. [step 2.2, L3, L4]

4.1 Steps 1.2 and 2.1 give the implication from the criterion to integrability, and steps 1.3, 2.2 and 3.1 give the converse; the two halves are independent and use no symbol in common, and together they are the stated equivalence. [step 2.1, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The strict inequality is not essential.** Requiring $U(f,P) - L(f,P) \le \varepsilon$ for every $\varepsilon > 0$ defines the same condition, since a partition working for $\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$ works strictly for $\varepsilon$. Statements below use whichever form is convenient and no consequence turns on the difference.

- **The common refinement is where the two partitions are reconciled.** Step 2.2 produces one partition good for the lower sum and another good for the upper sum, and there is no reason for them to be the same. [[lem-refinement-inequalities]] is exactly what allows a single partition to inherit both properties, and it is the only place in this proof where anything beyond the definitions is used.

- **No choice principle is used.** Steps 1.2, 2.2 and 3.1 instantiate finitely many existential statements, which is ordinary first-order reasoning. See [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].
