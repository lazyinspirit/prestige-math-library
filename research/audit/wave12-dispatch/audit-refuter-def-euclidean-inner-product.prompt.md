You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as
an independent adversarial proof-refuter. Return evidence only; Audit-Alpha
alone adjudicates and edits.

## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` Statement or consumer, actively search for a
counterexample or a failure in the witness or cited generated premise. A false
public claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or
materially inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is
nonfatal.

Return no more than 450 words, exactly in this shape:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

For each defect:

```text
FINDING 1
  location: [exact section/fact/step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [exact assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]
```

Always end with:

```text
BOUNDARY: [specific boundary/counterexample checks and disposition]
SOURCES:  [confirm every supplied cited item used by the target was inspected]
CHECKED:  [confirm title, public claim, every numbered step, and Remarks]
```

## Definition

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. A natural number is a von Neumann natural, that is a set,
and $n = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]],
[[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]), so

$$\mathbb{R}^{n} \;=\; \{\, x \;:\; x \text{ is a function } n \to \mathbb{R} \,\}$$

is the function space of [[def-function-space]] at $F = \mathbb{R}$ and $X = n$,
a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ under the pointwise operations
([[def-vector-space]]). We write $x_k := x(k)$ for $k < n$, and two elements of
$\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are equal exactly when they agree at every $k < n$. This is the
same set that [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] calls $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.

The **Euclidean inner product** of $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the real number

$$\langle x, y\rangle \;:=\; \sum_{k<n} x_k\,y_k ,$$

the finite sum of [[def-finite-sum]] applied to the list $k \mapsto x_k y_k$
(extended by $0$ beyond $n$, as every finite list in this library is). The
**Euclidean norm** of $x$ is

$$\lVert x\rVert_2 \;:=\; \sqrt{\langle x, x\rangle},$$

which is defined because $\langle x,x\rangle = \sum_{k<n} x_k^{2} \ge 0$ (a sum
of nonnegative terms, [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 4 and
[[lem-of-square-positive]], the case $x_k = 0$ giving $x_k^2 = 0$ by
[[def-integer-power]]) and every nonnegative real has a unique nonnegative square
root ([[thm-of-square-roots]]).

### Both are defined for every $n$, including $n = 0$

At $n = 0$ the set $\mathbb{R}^{0}$ has exactly one element, the empty function,
and it is the zero vector space ([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]] clause 5); the sum
above is the empty sum, so $\langle x,y\rangle = 0$ and $\lVert x\rVert_2 = 0$.
**This is the first place on this page where the two index regimes diverge, and
the divergence is deliberate.** The published metrics $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_\infty$ of
[[lem-metrics-on-rn]] are defined only for $n \ge 1$, because $d_\infty$ would
otherwise be a maximum over the empty index set; the algebra above needs no such
restriction. The boundary in this page runs between the algebra and the metric,
not where a reader would guess, and [[rem-rn-conventions-and-scope]] lists
exactly which items inherit $n \ge 1$.

### The algebra of the inner product

For all $x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$:

1. **Symmetry.** $\langle x,y\rangle = \langle y,x\rangle$, since $x_ky_k = y_kx_k$
   termwise.
2. **Additivity in the first argument.**
   $\langle x + y, z\rangle = \langle x,z\rangle + \langle y,z\rangle$: the list
   $k \mapsto (x_k+y_k)z_k$ is the termwise sum of $k \mapsto x_kz_k$ and
   $k \mapsto y_kz_k$, so [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 1 applies.
3. **Homogeneity in the first argument.**
   $\langle \lambda x, y\rangle = \lambda\langle x,y\rangle$, by
   [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 2.
4. **Bilinearity.** Clauses 2 and 3 together with symmetry give the same two laws
   in the second argument.
5. **Positive definiteness.** $\langle x,x\rangle \ge 0$, and
   $\langle x,x\rangle = 0$ if and only if $x = 0$. Indeed a vanishing sum of
   nonnegative terms has every term $0$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 4), so
   $x_k^{2} = 0$ for every $k < n$, and a nonzero real has a positive square
   ([[lem-of-square-positive]]), whence $x_k = 0$ for every $k < n$ and $x = 0$.
6. **Agreement with the published Euclidean metric.** For $n \ge 1$ and
   $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$,
   $\lVert x - y\rVert_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}(x_k-y_k)^{2}} = d_2(x,y)$, the two
   sides being the same expression ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]]). In particular
   $\lVert x\rVert_2 = d_2(x, 0)$.

That $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ is a norm in the sense of [[def-norm-and-normed-space]]
is proved in [[thm-cauchy-schwarz-and-the-euclidean-norm]], where the triangle
inequality is obtained from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality; it is not assumed
here.

## Remarks

- **Scope: the concrete form only.** What is defined above is the Euclidean inner
  product on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and nothing more. The general theory of inner
  product spaces — abstract inner products, orthonormal bases, Gram-Schmidt,
  orthogonal projection and orthogonal complements of arbitrary subspaces — is
  planned for a page of this library that comes **earlier in the plan order** and
  is not yet built. No item on this page claims anything about abstract inner
  product spaces, and no item on this page introduces the general notion.

- **The standard basis and coordinates.** For $i < n$ the standard unit vector
  $e_i \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ has $e_i(i) = 1$ and $e_i(j) = 0$ for $j \ne i$
  ([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]]). Then $\langle x, e_i\rangle = x_i$: the list
  $k \mapsto x_k (e_i)_k$ vanishes except at $k = i$, where its value is $x_i$,
  and a list vanishing off one index sums to its value there
  ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 3, splitting the range at $i$). So the
  coordinates of $x$ are recovered by testing against the standard basis, which
  is the form used repeatedly below.

- **Powers here are integer powers.** $x_k^{2}$ means the integer power of
  [[def-integer-power]], and $\lVert x\rVert_2^{2} = \langle x,x\rangle$ by
  [[thm-of-square-roots]] and [[lem-power-laws]].

## Definition

Throughout this page $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), in particular an ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]]) and a field ([[def-field]]), and $\mathbb{N}$ is the set
of natural numbers ([[def-natural-numbers]]) with successor $\sigma(n) = n + 1$
([[def-nat-addition]]).

Let $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a sequence of reals, written $a_k$ for
$a(k)$. **Finite sums and finite products of $a$ are defined by recursion on the
upper index**, which is legitimate because of the recursion theorem
([[thm-recursion]]). That theorem produces a function of one variable, so the
running index has to be carried along inside the value: applying it to the set
$A = \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$, the starting element $(0, 0)$ and the function
$f(n, s) = (\sigma(n),\, s + a_n)$ gives a unique
$g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$ with

$$g(0) = (0, 0), \qquad g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n)) \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Write $g(n) = \big(\pi_1(g(n)),\, \Sigma_n\big)$ for its two coordinates.

**The first coordinate is the index itself, and that is a small induction, not an
observation** ([[thm-induction-principle]]). Indeed $\pi_1(g(0)) = 0$; and if
$\pi_1(g(n)) = n$, then
$g(\sigma(n)) = f\big(\pi_1(g(n)), \Sigma_n\big) = \big(\sigma(\pi_1(g(n))),\, \Sigma_n + a_{\pi_1(g(n))}\big) = \big(\sigma(n),\, \Sigma_n + a_n\big)$,
so $\pi_1(g(\sigma(n))) = \sigma(n)$. By induction $\pi_1(g(n)) = n$ for every
$n \in \mathbb{N}$. Only now may the second coordinate of the two displayed
clauses be read off, and doing so gives

$$\Sigma_0 = 0, \qquad \Sigma_{\sigma(n)} = \Sigma_n + a_n .$$

$\Sigma$ is moreover the **unique** function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with those
two properties: if $\Sigma'$ also has them then $n \mapsto (n, \Sigma'_n)$ satisfies
the two clauses defining $g$, hence equals $g$ by the uniqueness clause of
[[thm-recursion]], so $\Sigma' = \Sigma$.

We write $\sum_{k < n} a_k := \Sigma_n$. The same construction with starting
element $(0, 1)$ and $f(n, p) = (\sigma(n),\, p \cdot a_n)$, with the same
induction on the first coordinate and the same uniqueness argument, gives the
unique $\Pi : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with

$$\Pi_0 = 1, \qquad \Pi_{\sigma(n)} = \Pi_n \cdot a_n ,$$

and we write $\prod_{k < n} a_k := \Pi_n$.

**Notation.** For $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ we abbreviate

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \sum_{k < n+1} a_k, \qquad \prod_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \prod_{k < n+1} a_k,$$

and, for a general lower index $m$ with $m \le n + 1$, writing $d = n + 1 - m$
for the number of terms,

$$\sum_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \sum_{j < d} a_{m+j}, \qquad \prod_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \prod_{j < d} a_{m+j} .$$

When $m = n + 1$ we have $d = 0$ and the sum is **empty**, with value $0$, while
the empty product has value $1$. In the same spirit $\sum_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ is
notation for the empty sum $\Sigma_0 = 0$ and $\prod_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ for the
empty product $\Pi_0 = 1$; the index $-1$ never occurs as an element of
$\mathbb{N}$ and is only a way of writing "no terms".

Only finitely many values of $a$ enter $\sum_{k<n} a_k$, so the notation
$\sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\prod_{k<n} a_k$ is also used for a list
$a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$ of reals given without reference to any extension of the
list to all of $\mathbb{N}$: extend the list by $a_k = 0$ (respectively
$a_k = 1$) for $k \ge n$ and apply the definition above.

## Remarks

- **Why recursion and not "$a_0 + a_1 + \cdots + a_{n-1}$".** The dots are not a
  definition: they presuppose that the displayed pattern determines a value for
  every $n$, which is exactly what the recursion theorem
  ([[thm-recursion]]) supplies, and its uniqueness clause is what makes
  $\sum_{k<n} a_k$ a single well-determined real rather than a family of choices.
  Associativity and commutativity of addition are *not* used in the definition;
  they are used in the laws proved from it ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).
- **Naturals and rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$ (a convention used on the whole
  page).** A natural number $n$ and a rational number $r$ are not literally
  elements of $\mathbb{R}$: they enter $\mathbb{R}$ through the canonical
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$, which is an injective,
  order-preserving field homomorphism ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), restricting on
  positive naturals to $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} = 1_\mathbb{R} + \cdots + 1_\mathbb{R}$
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). Following ordinary practice, and only where no
  confusion is possible, we write $n$ for $\iota(n)$ and $r$ for $\iota(r)$; so,
  for instance, $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k<n} a_k$ means
  $\iota(n)^{-1} \cdot \sum_{k<n} a_k$, which makes sense because
  $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$. Exponents are the one place where the
  identification is deliberately NOT made: in $a^n$ and $a^r$ the exponent stays
  a natural, an integer or a rational ([[def-integer-power]],
  [[def-rational-power]]), never a real.
- The two indexings are related by $\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k = \sum_{k < n+1} a_k$, so
  a statement proved for one is available for the other. Sums over $k < n$ are
  the primitive form here because $\Sigma_0$, the empty sum, is then the base
  case of every induction, and no index outside $\mathbb{N}$ is ever needed.

## Definition

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]) and let $X$ be any set. Write

$$F^{X} \;:=\; \{\, f \;:\; f \text{ is a function } X \to F \,\},$$

and for $f \in F^{X}$ write $f(x)$ for its value at $x \in X$. Two elements of
$F^{X}$ are equal exactly when they agree at every point of $X$. Define

$$(f + g)(x) \;:=\; f(x) + g(x), \qquad (\lambda f)(x) \;:=\; \lambda\, f(x), \qquad 0_{F^{X}}(x) \;:=\; 0_F,$$

for $f, g \in F^{X}$, $\lambda \in F$ and $x \in X$, the operations on the right
being those of $F$. These are the **pointwise** operations.

**These rules really are the required data.** For $f, g \in F^{X}$ the assignment
$x \mapsto f(x) + g(x)$ is a function $X \to F$, so $+$ is a binary operation
$F^{X} \times F^{X} \to F^{X}$ ([[def-binary-operation]]); for $\lambda \in F$ and
$f \in F^{X}$ the assignment $x \mapsto \lambda f(x)$ is a function $X \to F$, so
scalar multiplication is a map $F \times F^{X} \to F^{X}$; and $0_{F^{X}}$, the
constant function at $0_F$, is an element of $F^{X}$.

**$F^{X}$ is a vector space over $F$** ([[def-vector-space]]). Each axiom is an
equation between elements of $F^{X}$, hence holds exactly when it holds at every
$x \in X$ after evaluation, and there it is the corresponding field axiom applied
to the values $f(x), g(x), \lambda, \mu$:

- associativity and commutativity of $+$, and $f + 0_{F^{X}} = f$, come from the
  same laws for $+$ in $F$; the additive inverse of $f$ is $x \mapsto -f(x)$,
  which lies in $F^{X}$ and satisfies $f + (-f) = 0_{F^{X}}$ pointwise. This is
  axiom (V1);
- $\bigl(\lambda(f+g)\bigr)(x) = \lambda(f(x)+g(x)) = \lambda f(x) + \lambda g(x)$
  is (V2), by distributivity in $F$;
- $\bigl((\lambda+\mu)f\bigr)(x) = (\lambda+\mu)f(x) = \lambda f(x) + \mu f(x)$ is
  (V3), by distributivity in $F$;
- $\bigl((\lambda\mu)f\bigr)(x) = (\lambda\mu)f(x) = \lambda(\mu f(x))$ is (V4),
  by associativity of multiplication in $F$;
- $(1_F f)(x) = 1_F f(x) = f(x)$ is (V5), by the multiplicative identity law
  in $F$.

### The case $X = n$

A natural number is a von Neumann natural ([[def-natural-numbers]]), that is a
set, and $n = \{\, m \in \mathbb{N} : m < n \,\} = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$
([[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]). Taking $X = n$ therefore gives

$$F^{n} \;=\; \{\, x \;:\; x \text{ is a function } n \to F \,\},$$

whose elements are written $x = (x_0, x_1, \dots, x_{n-1})$ with $x_i := x(i)$ for
$i < n$. **The coordinates are indexed from $0$**, because $0 \in n$ whenever
$n \ne 0$ and $n \notin n$ always. The operations read

$$(x + y)_i = x_i + y_i, \qquad (\lambda x)_i = \lambda x_i \qquad (i < n),$$

and the zero of $F^{n}$ is the tuple all of whose coordinates are $0_F$.

**The two boundary cases.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$, so $n = 0$ is a genuine
case. Since $0 = \varnothing$, the set $F^{0} = F^{\varnothing}$ has exactly one
element, the empty function; that element is $0_{F^{0}}$, so $F^{0}$ is the
**zero space** $\{0_{F^{0}}\}$, not the empty set. For $n = 1$ we have
$1 = \{0\}$, and the map $F^{1} \to F$ sending $x$ to its single coordinate $x_0$
is a bijection satisfying $(x+y)_0 = x_0 + y_0$ and $(\lambda x)_0 = \lambda x_0$;
we use it to read $F^{1}$ as $F$ where convenient. (No general notion of
isomorphism of vector spaces is available on this page, and none is claimed here:
what is asserted is exactly the displayed bijection and the two displayed
equations.)

## Remarks

- **The same set $F^{X}$ also carries a ring structure, and the two must not be
  conflated.** For a ring $R$ and a set $X$, [[def-ring-of-functions]] equips the
  set $R^{X}$ of all functions $X \to R$ with pointwise addition and pointwise
  multiplication. Taking $R = F$, the underlying set is literally the same set
  $F^{X}$ as here, and **the addition is literally the same operation**,
  $(f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)$ in both. What differs is the second operation:

  | | second operation | type |
  |---|---|---|
  | ring of functions | $(fg)(x) = f(x)\,g(x)$ | $F^{X} \times F^{X} \to F^{X}$ |
  | vector space (here) | $(\lambda f)(x) = \lambda\, f(x)$ | $F \times F^{X} \to F^{X}$ |

  Neither is a special case of the other, since they do not even have the same
  domain: one multiplies two functions, the other multiplies a function by a
  scalar. They agree in the following sense, and this is the whole of the
  relation between them: for $\lambda \in F$ let $c_\lambda \in F^{X}$ be the
  constant function at $\lambda$; then $\lambda f$ and the ring product
  $c_\lambda f$ have the same value $\lambda f(x)$ at every $x$, so they are
  equal. Both structures are present on $F^{X}$ at once, and nothing on this page
  uses the ring product.

- **Why $F^{n}$ is defined this way rather than as "$n$-tuples".** An $n$-tuple is
  already a function on an index set, and taking that index set to be the natural
  number $n$ itself makes the coordinates, the finite sums of
  [[def-monoid-finite-product]] and the induction arguments below all run over the
  same object. The price is that every index starts at $0$, and that $F^{0}$ is a
  one-element space; both are recorded above so that no statement on this page or
  its companion is quietly restricted to $n \ge 1$.

- **$X$ is arbitrary.** Nothing above assumes $X$ finite, countable, or nonempty.
  The case $X = \mathbb{N}$ gives the space of all families of scalars indexed by
  $\mathbb{N}$, and the case $X = m \times n$ gives the matrices of
  [[def-matrix-space]].

## Definition

Let $a \in \mathbb{R}$, where $\mathbb{R}$ is the ambient ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]).

**Natural exponents.** By the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) applied to
the set $\mathbb{R}$, the starting element $1$ and the function
$f(x) = x \cdot a$, there is a unique function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$,
written $n \mapsto a^n$, with

$$a^0 = 1, \qquad a^{n+1} = a^n \cdot a \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Thus $a^1 = a$, $a^2 = a \cdot a$, and so on. Note that this is defined for
**every** $a$, including $a = 0$.

**Negative exponents.** If $a \ne 0$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, set

$$a^{-n} := (a^n)^{-1}.$$

**Why that is legitimate.** The right-hand side presupposes that $a^n$ is
invertible, that is, that $a^n \ne 0$. This is a proof obligation and not an
observation, and it is discharged by claim 2 of [[lem-power-laws]]: for $a \ne 0$
in a field, $a^n \ne 0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, proved there by induction on
$n$ from the fact that a field has no zero divisors ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]).
That lemma is a statement *about* the operation introduced here, so it depends on
this definition and is recorded in this item's `justified_by` rather than in its
`deps` (SCHEMA §3). Given $a^n \ne 0$, the value $(a^n)^{-1}$ is a single
well-determined element, because multiplicative inverses in a field are unique
([[lem-of-inverse-unique]]).

**Integer exponents.** Every integer $m$ ([[def-integers]]) is either
$\iota(n)$ or $-\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$, where $\iota$ is the
embedding $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]],
[[def-int-operations]]). This too is a citation and not a slogan: the order on
$\mathbb{Z}$ is total ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), so $m \ge 0$ or $m < 0$; the
image of $\iota$ is exactly the set of nonnegative integers, and each of them is
$\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]); and if $m < 0$ then
$-m > 0$, by compatibility of the order with addition ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]),
so $-m = \iota(n)$ and $m = -\iota(n)$, with $n$ unique because $\iota$ is
injective. The two clauses above therefore define $a^m$ for every
$m \in \mathbb{Z}$ whenever $a \ne 0$, and for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$ for
arbitrary $a$. The clauses are consistent where they overlap: the only overlap is
$m = 0$, where $-\iota(0) = \iota(0)$ and $(a^0)^{-1} = 1^{-1} = 1 = a^0$.

## Remarks

- **The convention $0^0 = 1$ is adopted here**, and it is not a matter of taste
  but of agreement with the recursion above: $a^0 = 1$ is the starting value for
  every $a$, exactly as the empty product is $1$ ([[def-finite-sum]]). This is
  the convention that makes the empty product, the binomial theorem, and
  polynomial notation $\sum_k c_k x^k$ work at $x = 0$ without an exception. The
  competing convention "$0^0$ undefined" belongs to contexts where $x^y$ is
  studied as a function of two *real* variables and one wants continuity, which
  is unavailable and irrelevant here: the exponent in $a^m$ is an integer, never
  a real.
- $0^n = 0$ for every $n \ge 1$, since $0^{n} = 0^{n-1} \cdot 0 = 0$, a product
  with a zero factor ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]); and
  $0^{-n}$ is not defined for $n \ge 1$, since $0$ has no inverse.
- The exponent is an integer and stays an integer. Rational exponents are a
  separate construction resting on the existence of roots
  ([[thm-nth-roots-exist]], [[def-rational-power]]), and real exponents do not
  exist in this library yet ([[rem-real-exponents-deferred]]).
- The laws $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$ are
  proved, not assumed, in [[lem-power-laws]]; the order behaviour of $a \mapsto a^n$
  is [[lem-power-monotone]].

## Definition

The set of **natural numbers** is the **smallest inductive set**
([[def-inductive-set]]),

$$\mathbb{N} = \omega := \bigcap\,\{\, I : I \text{ is inductive} \,\},$$

which exists and is itself inductive by [[lem-omega-smallest-inductive]] (the
Axiom of Infinity, [[def-axiom-of-infinity]], supplies one inductive set to
intersect within, and Separation, [[def-axiom-schema-of-separation]], makes the
intersection a set). On $\mathbb{N}$ we take

$$0 := \varnothing, \qquad \sigma(n) := n \cup \{n\},$$

the distinguished element and the successor function. Thus
$0 = \varnothing$, $1 = \{0\}$, $2 = \{0, 1\}$, $3 = \{0, 1, 2\}$, and in general
$n = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ is the set of its predecessors.

## Remarks

"Smallest" means $\omega \subseteq I$ for every inductive set $I$. This minimality
is exactly the **induction principle** ([[thm-induction-principle]]): a subset of
$\mathbb{N}$ that contains $0$ and is closed under $\sigma$ is itself inductive,
hence contains $\omega = \mathbb{N}$, hence equals $\mathbb{N}$.

With $0$ and $\sigma$ so defined, $(\mathbb{N}, 0, \sigma)$ satisfies the Peano
axioms ([[def-peano-system]], proved in [[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]), so it is a
**model** of the abstract natural numbers. By categoricity
([[thm-peano-categoricity]]) any other model is uniquely isomorphic to it, so the
particular set-theoretic encoding chosen here is immaterial to every arithmetic
and order property that follows: those are developed from the Peano axioms, not
from the sets themselves.

## Definition

Throughout this page $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) constructed in this library, in particular a
field, so that "vector space" below always means vector space over $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-vector-space]]).

Let $V$ be a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$, with zero vector $0_V$. A **norm on
$V$** is a function $N : V \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $u, v \in V$ and all
$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$:

- **(N1) Separation.** $N(v) = 0$ if and only if $v = 0_V$.
- **(N2) Absolute homogeneity.** $N(\lambda v) = |\lambda|\,N(v)$, the absolute
  value being that of [[def-abs-value]].
- **(N3) Triangle inequality.** $N(u + v) \le N(u) + N(v)$.

A **normed space** is a pair $(V, N)$ consisting of a vector space $V$ over
$\mathbb{R}$ and a norm $N$ on it. When only one norm is in play we write
$\lVert v\rVert$ for $N(v)$; when several are, the norm is always named.

**The values of a norm are real numbers.** The codomain is $\mathbb{R}$, so
$N(v)$ is an honest element of the complete ordered field and no infinite value
is permitted. This is the same convention [[rem-metric-axiom-conventions]]
records for metrics.

### Nonnegativity is a theorem, not an axiom

Many texts add a fourth condition $N(v) \ge 0$. It is redundant. Applying (N2)
with $\lambda = -1$ gives $N(-v) = |-1|\,N(v) = N(v)$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]],
[[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]] for $(-1)v = -v$), and then (N3)
with $u = v$ and $-v$ gives

$$0 \;=\; N(0_V) \;=\; N\bigl(v + (-v)\bigr) \;\le\; N(v) + N(-v) \;=\; N(v) + N(v),$$

where $N(0_V) = 0$ is (N1). So $N(v) + N(v) \ge 0$, and if $N(v) < 0$ then
$N(v) + N(v) < 0$ by addition of inequalities, which trichotomy forbids
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]). Hence $N(v) \ge 0$ for every $v \in V$.

**Consequently the verification of a candidate norm has three things to check and
not four**, exactly as the verification of a candidate metric has three and not
four ([[def-metric-space]], [[lem-metric-nonnegativity]]). No item in this
library assumes nonnegativity of a norm before the argument above.

### The induced metric

Let $N$ be a norm on $V$ and define

$$d_N(u,v) \;:=\; N(u - v) \qquad (u, v \in V),$$

where $u - v = u + (-v)$ ([[def-vector-space]]). **Then $d_N$ is a metric on
$V$** ([[def-metric-space]]), and the three axioms are the three conditions
above, in order:

- **(M1)** $d_N(u,v) = 0$ means $N(u-v) = 0$, which by (N1) says $u - v = 0_V$,
  that is $u = v$; and conversely $d_N(v,v) = N(0_V) = 0$.
- **(M2)** $d_N(v,u) = N(v-u) = N\bigl((-1)(u-v)\bigr) = |-1|\,N(u-v) = d_N(u,v)$,
  by (N2), [[lem-of-abs-value]] and $(-1)w = -w$
  ([[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]]).
- **(M3)** $d_N(u,w) = N\bigl((u-v) + (v-w)\bigr) \le N(u-v) + N(v-w) = d_N(u,v) + d_N(v,w)$,
  by (N3).

A normed space is therefore a metric space, and every notion defined for metric
spaces — open set ([[def-metric-topology]]), convergence, Cauchyness,
continuity, compactness — is available in it with no further definition. **This
library never introduces a second notion of any of them for normed spaces.**

### Two properties an arbitrary metric need not have

The metric $d_N$ satisfies, for all $u, v, w \in V$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$:

- **translation invariance**, $d_N(u + w, v + w) = N\bigl((u+w)-(v+w)\bigr) = N(u-v) = d_N(u,v)$;
- **absolute homogeneity**, $d_N(\lambda u, \lambda v) = N\bigl(\lambda(u-v)\bigr) = |\lambda|\,d_N(u,v)$, by (N2).

**Not every metric on a vector space arises from a norm**, and homogeneity is
what fails. The published bounded remetrisation [[lem-bounded-remetrisation]]
replaces a metric $d$ by $d' = \min\{d, 1\}$, a metric with the same topology
whose values never exceed $1$; on a vector space $V$ containing a vector $v$ with
$d(v, 0_V) > 0$ this $d'$ cannot be $d_M$ for any norm $M$, since absolute
homogeneity would force $d'(\lambda v, 0_V) = |\lambda|\,d'(v, 0_V)$, which is
unbounded in $\lambda$, while $d'$ is bounded by $1$. So the passage from norms
to metrics is not reversible, and a statement about a metric on a vector space is
strictly weaker than the corresponding statement about a norm.

## Remarks

- **Why (N1) is stated as an equivalence.** The direction $N(0_V) = 0$ is forced
  by (N2) with $\lambda = 0$, since $0\,v = 0_V$
  ([[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]]) gives $N(0_V) = |0|\,N(v) = 0$.
  Only the direction "$N(v) = 0$ implies $v = 0_V$" is a genuine assumption, and
  dropping it gives what is usually called a seminorm, a notion this library does
  not use. The situation is exactly the one [[rem-metric-axiom-conventions]]
  describes for (M1) and the pseudometric.

- **The zero space carries exactly one norm.** If $V = \{0_V\}$ then the only
  function $V \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying (N1) is the one with value $0$, and it
  satisfies (N2) and (N3) trivially. In particular $\mathbb{R}^{0}$, the function
  space on the empty index set ([[def-function-space]]), is a normed space,
  although the metrics of the published metric theory on $\mathbb{R}^n$ are
  defined only for $n \ge 1$.

- **What is not defined here.** This item does not define linear maps; their
  published definition is [[def-linear-map]]. It also does not define operator
  norms, dual spaces, or abstract inner product spaces.
  [[rem-rn-conventions-and-scope]] records the remaining scope boundaries and
  what each later development would license.

## Definition

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]), with additive identity $0_F$, multiplicative
identity $1_F$, and the field axioms as stated there. A **vector space over $F$**,
also called an **$F$-vector space**, consists of

- a set $V$, whose elements are called **vectors**;
- a binary operation $+ : V \times V \to V$ on $V$ ([[def-binary-operation]]),
  the **vector addition**;
- an element $0_V \in V$, the **zero vector**;
- a map $\cdot \,:\, F \times V \to V$, the **scalar multiplication**, written
  $\lambda v := \cdot(\lambda, v)$;

subject to the following axioms, in which $u, v \in V$ and $\lambda, \mu \in F$
are arbitrary.

- **(V1)** $(V, +, 0_V)$ is an abelian group ([[def-group]]): $+$ is associative
  and commutative, $0_V$ is a two-sided identity for $+$
  ([[def-identity-element]]), and every $v \in V$ has an additive inverse
  ([[def-invertible-element]]).
- **(V2)** $\lambda(u + v) = \lambda u + \lambda v$.
- **(V3)** $(\lambda + \mu)v = \lambda v + \mu v$.
- **(V4)** $(\lambda\mu)v = \lambda(\mu v)$.
- **(V5)** $1_F v = v$.

The elements of $F$ are called **scalars**. When several vector spaces are in
play we write $0_V$ for the zero of $V$, and we write $-v$ for the additive
inverse of $v$ and $u - v := u + (-v)$.

**The notation $0_V$ and $-v$ is legitimate.** Axiom (V1) asserts only that some
two-sided identity and some additive inverses exist. That there is at most one
two-sided identity for $+$ is [[lem-identity-unique]], and that an invertible
element of a monoid has exactly one inverse is [[lem-inverse-unique]]; both are
proved before [[def-group]] and are inherited here with the group structure. So
$0_V$ and $-v$ denote well-defined elements, and nothing below re-derives them.

**What (V1) buys, and why it is not restated.** Associativity, commutativity, the
identity law $v + 0_V = v = 0_V + v$, the inverse law $v + (-v) = 0_V$,
cancellation ([[lem-group-cancellation]]) and the inverse identities
([[lem-group-inverse-laws]]) are facts about abelian groups. They are quoted from
the group page wherever they are used and are never proved again for vectors.

## Remarks

- **Scalar multiplication is not a binary operation on a set.** It is a map
  $F \times V \to V$ with arguments from two different sets, so
  [[def-binary-operation]], which is about a map $S \times S \to S$, does not
  apply to it and is never cited for it. The definition above cites that item for
  the vector addition only. In particular "closed under scalar multiplication"
  below always means $\lambda v \in W$ for $\lambda \in F$ and $v \in W$, which is
  not an instance of the closure condition defined there.

- **(V5) is an axiom, not a consequence of (V2)–(V4).** Take any abelian group
  $(V,+,0_V)$ and define $\lambda v := 0_V$ for every $\lambda$ and $v$. Then
  (V2), (V3) and (V4) all hold, both sides of each being $0_V$, while (V5) fails
  as soon as $V \ne \{0_V\}$. So (V5) has to be imposed, and it is what ties the
  scalar action to the identity of $F$.

- **Two structures, one set.** A vector space is data: the set $V$, the addition,
  the zero, and the scalar multiplication, over a fixed field $F$. The same set
  may carry vector-space structures over different fields, and the field is part
  of the statement of every result below. [[lem-restriction-of-scalars]] is the
  first place where that matters.

- **The field is the published one.** No field axiom is restated here; $F$ is a
  field in the sense of [[def-field]], whose axiom (A) already says that $(F,+)$
  is an abelian group and whose axiom (M) says the same of
  $(F \setminus \{0_F\}, \cdot)$. In particular every field is a vector space over
  itself, which is [[lem-restriction-of-scalars]].

## Statement

Let $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be sequences of reals, let
$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, and let $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, with finite sums and
finite products as in [[def-finite-sum]]. Then:

1. **Additivity.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k$.
2. **Scaling.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k$; in particular $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda = n\lambda$, where $n$ denotes the canonical natural $\iota(n) \in \mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).
3. **Splitting.** If $m \le n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k$, and $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n} a_k = \Big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k\Big)$.
4. **Monotonicity.** If $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$. In particular, if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, every single term satisfies $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$ for $j < n$, and $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ forces $a_k = 0$ for every $k < n$.
5. **Telescoping.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}\big(c_{k+1} - c_k\big) = c_n - c_0$.
6. **Products.** $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k) = \Big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\Big)$; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, and if $a_k > 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k > 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\lambda$, and naturals $m, n$. Write $\Sigma_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\Pi_n = \prod_{k<n} a_k$.

[L1] Recursion clauses ([[def-finite-sum]]): $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ and $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n$; $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1$ and $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) \cdot a_n$; and $\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k = \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j}$ for $m \le n$, likewise for products.

[L2] Field axioms: addition and multiplication are associative and commutative, $0$ and $1$ are the identities, $x - x = 0$, and multiplication distributes over addition ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]); and $0 \cdot x = 0$, which is not an axiom but a lemma ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

[L3] Induction principle: a property holding at $0$ and inherited by successors holds at every natural ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L4] Adding inequalities: $x \le y$ and $u \le v$ imply $x + u \le y + v$. [[lem-of-add-order]] states the STRICT forms and only those ($x < y \Rightarrow x + c < y + c$, and $x < y$ with $u < v$ giving $x + u < y + v$); the nonstrict form used throughout below is those two together with the cases $x = y$ and $u = v$, which are settled by trichotomy, the order being total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] The canonical embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a field homomorphism, so $\iota(0) = 0$ and $\iota(n+1) = \iota(n) + 1$, and $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L6] Sign rules: a product of two positives is positive ([[lem-of-sign-rules]], claim 1), and a product of two nonnegatives is nonnegative, since a factor equal to $0$ makes the product $0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]) and otherwise both factors are positive; and $1 > 0$, which is proved in [[cor-of-one-positive]] and stated by none of the items named above.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 0$: every claim holds at $n = 0$, since both sides of claim 1 are $0 = 0 + 0$, both sides of claim 2 are $0 = \lambda \cdot 0$ and $0 = \iota(0)\lambda$, claim 4 reads $0 \le 0$ with no term to bound and the hypothesis $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ giving nothing to prove, claim 5 reads $0 = c_0 - c_0$, and claim 6 reads $1 = 1 \cdot 1$ with $1 > 0$. [base, L1, L2, L5, L6]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for this $n$ and for all sequences $a, b, c$ and all $\lambda$. [ih]

1.3 Splitting, claim 3, by a separate induction on the number of trailing terms $d = n - m$ with $m$ fixed: for $d = 0$ the claim reads $\sum_{k<m} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + 0$ and $\prod_{k<m} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\big) \cdot 1$, which hold; and if $\sum_{k<m+d} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d} a_{m+j}$, then $\sum_{k<m+d+1} a_k = \sum_{k<m+d} a_k + a_{m+d} = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \big(\sum_{j<d} a_{m+j} + a_{m+d}\big) = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d+1} a_{m+j}$ by associativity, and identically for products with $1$ in place of $0$ and multiplication in place of addition, so induction on $d$ gives claim 3 for every $m \le n$. [L1, L2, L3]

2.1 Additivity at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k\big) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) + \big(\sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n\big) = \sum_{k<n+1} a_k + \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$, using the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of addition. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Scaling at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda a_k = \sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda\big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) = \lambda \sum_{k<n+1} a_k$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and distributivity; taking $a_k = 1$ for all $k$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda = \sum_{k<n} \lambda + \lambda = \iota(n)\lambda + \lambda = (\iota(n) + 1)\lambda = \iota(n+1)\lambda$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L5]

2.3 Monotonicity at $n+1$: assume $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n+1$; then $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$, so the hypothesis gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$, and adding the inequality $a_n \le b_n$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n \le \sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n = \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$. [step 1.2, L1, L4]

2.4 Telescoping at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(c_{k+1} - c_k) = \sum_{k<n}(c_{k+1} - c_k) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = (c_n - c_0) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = c_{n+1} - c_0$, by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and the field identities. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.5 Products at $n+1$: $\prod_{k<n+1}(a_k b_k) = \big(\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k)\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n+1} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n+1} b_k\big)$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of multiplication; and if every $a_k \ge 0$ for $k < n+1$ then $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) a_n$ is a product of two nonnegatives, hence nonnegative, with the same argument giving positivity from positivity since $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1 > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L6]

3.1 Consequences of monotonicity, completing claim 4: monotonicity itself holds at every $n$, by the induction principle applied to the base case of step 1.1 and the successor step 2.3, so it is available for an arbitrary $n$ in what follows; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then comparing with the zero sequence gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge \sum_{k<n} 0 = 0$; for $j < n$ splitting at $j$ and then at $j+1$ writes $\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<j} a_k + a_j + \sum_{k=j+1}^{n-1} a_k$ with the first and third summands $\ge 0$, so $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$; and if moreover $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ then $0 \le a_j \le 0$ for every $j < n$, so $a_j = 0$. [step 1.1, step 2.3, step 1.3, L3, L4, L2]

4.1 By the induction principle claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and claim 3 was proved in step 1.3 with its consequences in step 3.1, so all six laws hold. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, step 2.5, step 1.3, step 3.1, L3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$. A von Neumann natural is the set of its
predecessors, $n = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]), so it can be
used directly as an index set. Define

$$\mathbb{R}^n := \{\, x : x \text{ is a function } n \to \mathbb{R} \,\},$$

and write $x_k$ for $x(k)$, $k < n$. Two elements of $\mathbb{R}^n$ are equal
exactly when they agree at every $k < n$, functions being equal when they have
the same values. For $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ put

$$d_1(x,y) := \sum_{k<n} |x_k - y_k|, \qquad d_2(x,y) := \sqrt{\ \sum_{k<n} (x_k - y_k)^2\ }, \qquad d_\infty(x,y) := \max\{\, |x_k - y_k| : k < n \,\}.$$

All three are well defined: the finite sums are those of [[def-finite-sum]]; the
sum of squares is nonnegative ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[lem-of-square-positive]])
so it has a unique nonnegative square root ([[thm-of-square-roots]]); and
$\{|x_k - y_k| : k < n\}$ is a nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$, because
$n \ge 1$, so it has a maximum ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

**Then $d_1$, $d_2$ and $d_\infty$ are metrics on $\mathbb{R}^n$**
([[def-metric-space]]).

**Why $n \ge 1$.** For $n = 0$ the set $\mathbb{R}^0$ has exactly one element,
the empty function, and $d_1$ and $d_2$ are the empty sum $0$ and its root; but
$d_\infty$ would be the maximum of the empty set, which does not exist. The
hypothesis $n \ge 1$ is therefore not decoration, and it is carried by every
statement about $d_\infty$ in this library.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural $n \ge 1$; elements $x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}^n$; and the lists $a_k := x_k - y_k$, $b_k := y_k - z_k$ for $k < n$, so that $a_k + b_k = x_k - z_k$. Write $A := \sum_{k<n} a_k^2$, $C := \sum_{k<n} b_k^2$ and $B := \sum_{k<n} a_k b_k$.

[L1] Laws of finite sums ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[def-finite-sum]]): additivity, scaling, monotonicity; a sum of nonnegative terms is nonnegative, every single term is at most the sum, and a sum of nonnegative terms that vanishes has every term $0$.

[L2] Absolute value ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]]): $|u| \ge 0$; $|u| = 0$ if and only if $u = 0$; $|-u| = |u|$; and $u \le |u|$.

[L3] Two-term triangle inequality: $|u + v| \le |u| + |v|$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L4] Minkowski's inequality at the rational exponent $p = 1$ ([[thm-minkowski-finite]]): $\sum_{k<n}|a_k + b_k| \le \sum_{k<n}|a_k| + \sum_{k<n}|b_k|$.

[L5] Cauchy-Schwarz in root form ([[thm-cauchy-schwarz-finite]]): $\big|\sum_{k<n} a_k b_k\big| \le \sqrt{\sum_{k<n} a_k^2}\ \sqrt{\sum_{k<n} b_k^2}$.

[L6] Square roots ([[thm-of-square-roots]]): every $c \ge 0$ has a unique $\sqrt{c} \ge 0$ with $(\sqrt{c})^2 = c$; in particular $\sqrt{c} = 0$ if and only if $c = 0$.

[L7] Squares ([[lem-of-square-positive]], [[def-integer-power]]): $u^2 \ge 0$ always, and $u^2 = 0$ only for $u = 0$; and monotonicity of squaring on the nonnegatives, $s \le t \iff s^2 \le t^2$ for $s, t \ge 0$ ([[lem-of-square-monotone]]).

[L8] Maximum of a nonempty finite set of reals: it exists, it belongs to the set, and it is an upper bound of the set ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L9] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: inequalities may be added and a constant added to both sides, in the strict form of [[lem-of-add-order]] and, together with the case of equality settled by totality ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]), in the nonstrict form used below.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Separation for $d_1$: $d_1(x,y) = \sum_{k<n}|a_k|$ is a sum of nonnegative terms, so it vanishes exactly when every $|a_k|$ vanishes, that is exactly when $x_k = y_k$ for all $k < n$, that is exactly when $x = y$. [L1, L2]

1.2 Separation for $d_2$: $d_2(x,y) = \sqrt{A}$ vanishes exactly when $A = 0$; $A$ is a sum of nonnegative terms, so $A = 0$ exactly when $a_k^2 = 0$ for every $k < n$, which happens exactly when every $a_k = 0$, that is exactly when $x = y$. [L1, L6, L7]

1.3 Separation for $d_\infty$: the maximum $d_\infty(x,y)$ belongs to $\{|a_k| : k < n\}$ and bounds it above, so it is $0$ exactly when every $|a_k| = 0$, that is exactly when $x = y$. [L2, L8]

1.4 Symmetry for all three: $|y_k - x_k| = |-(x_k - y_k)| = |x_k - y_k|$ and $(y_k - x_k)^2 = (x_k - y_k)^2$ for every $k < n$, so the three defining expressions are unchanged when $x$ and $y$ are exchanged. [L2, L7]

1.5 Triangle inequality for $d_1$: applying [L4] to the lists $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ gives $d_1(x,z) = \sum_{k<n}|a_k + b_k| \le \sum_{k<n}|a_k| + \sum_{k<n}|b_k| = d_1(x,y) + d_1(y,z)$. [L4]

1.6 Expanding with additivity and scaling: $\sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k)^2 = \sum_{k<n}\big(a_k^2 + 2a_kb_k + b_k^2\big) = A + 2B + C$. [L1, algebra]

1.7 By [L5] and $B \le |B|$: $B \le \sqrt{A}\,\sqrt{C}$, and $A = (\sqrt{A})^2$, $C = (\sqrt{C})^2$ with $\sqrt{A}, \sqrt{C} \ge 0$. [L2, L5, L6]

1.8 Triangle inequality for $d_\infty$: for each $k < n$, $|a_k + b_k| \le |a_k| + |b_k| \le d_\infty(x,y) + d_\infty(y,z)$ because the two maxima bound their sets; so $d_\infty(x,y) + d_\infty(y,z)$ is an upper bound of $\{|a_k + b_k| : k < n\}$, and the maximum $d_\infty(x,z)$ of that set is one of its elements, whence $d_\infty(x,z) \le d_\infty(x,y) + d_\infty(y,z)$. [L3, L8, L9]

2.1 Combining steps 1.6 and 1.7: $\sum_{k<n}(a_k+b_k)^2 = A + 2B + C \le (\sqrt{A})^2 + 2\sqrt{A}\sqrt{C} + (\sqrt{C})^2 = \big(\sqrt{A} + \sqrt{C}\big)^2$. [step 1.6, step 1.7, L9, algebra]

3.1 Both $d_2(x,z) = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}(a_k+b_k)^2}$ and $\sqrt{A} + \sqrt{C}$ are nonnegative, and by step 2.1 the square of the first is at most the square of the second, so monotonicity of squaring on the nonnegatives gives $d_2(x,z) \le \sqrt{A} + \sqrt{C} = d_2(x,y) + d_2(y,z)$. [step 2.1, L6, L7]

4.1 Each of $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_\infty$ satisfies (M1) by steps 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3, satisfies (M2) by step 1.4, and satisfies (M3) by steps 1.5, 3.1 and 1.8 respectively; hence all three are metrics on $\mathbb{R}^n$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.8, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **$\mathbb{R}^n$ is defined ZFC-natively here**, as the set of functions from
  the von Neumann natural $n$ to $\mathbb{R}$, precisely so that its coordinates
  are indexed by $k < n$ and the finite-sum machinery of [[def-finite-sum]],
  [[thm-minkowski-finite]] and [[thm-cauchy-schwarz-finite]], all of which sum
  over $k < n$, applies without any reindexing.
- **No rational power appears anywhere above.** The triangle inequality for
  $d_2$ is obtained from Cauchy-Schwarz and the existence of square roots, not
  from Minkowski at $p = 2$, so this lemma does not depend on the theory of
  rational exponents. Minkowski is used only at $p = 1$, where its statement is
  the termwise sum of the two-term triangle inequality.
- **The three metrics are Lipschitz equivalent, with explicit constants,** and
  in particular have the same topology; that computation is on the companion
  page and is not needed here.

## Statement

Let $\mathbb{N} = \omega$ be the von Neumann naturals, with $0 = \varnothing$ and
$\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]), and let $\le$ and $<$ be
the order defined additively by $m \le n \iff \exists k \in \mathbb{N}\ (m + k = n)$
and $m < n \iff (m \le n$ and $m \ne n)$ ([[def-nat-order]]). Then $\mathbb{N}$ is
a **transitive set**: every element of a natural number is itself a natural
number. Moreover, for all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$:

1. $m < n \iff m \in n$;
2. $m \le n \iff m \subseteq n$;
3. $n < \sigma(n)$, and $m < \sigma(n) \iff m \le n$;
4. $0 \le n$, and $0 \in n$ whenever $n \ne 0$.

Consequently $n = \{\, m \in \mathbb{N} : m < n \,\}$ for every $n$: a natural
number is exactly the set of the naturals below it.

**Why this is proved here.** [[def-nat-order]] defines the order additively and
records the identification with membership only as an orienting remark, without
proof. The countability arguments on this page use that identification as a
working fact, so it is established here, from the additive order and induction
alone. Nothing below uses ordinals or any later material.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $\mathbb{N} = \omega$ with $0 = \varnothing$ and $\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]); $m \le n \iff \exists k \in \mathbb{N}\ (m + k = n)$ and $m < n \iff (m \le n \text{ and } m \ne n)$ ([[def-nat-order]]). Note that $<$ is irreflexive by this definition alone, since $m < m$ would require $m \ne m$.

[L1] Induction: if $P(0)$ holds and $P(n)$ implies $P(\sigma(n))$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $P(n)$ holds for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L2] Addition: $m + 0 = m$ and $m + \sigma(k) = \sigma(m + k)$ ([[def-nat-addition]]); and $0 + n = n$ for every $n$ ([[lem-nat-add-identity]]).

[L3] $\le$ is a linear order on $\mathbb{N}$: reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive and total ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]); and exactly one of $m < n$, $m = n$, $n < m$ holds, so the failure of $m \le n$ is exactly $n < m$ ([[lem-nat-trichotomy]]).

[L4] Discreteness: $m < n \iff \sigma(m) \le n$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]).

[L5] Every natural number is a transitive set and satisfies $n \notin n$ ([[lem-nat-transitive-irreflexive]]).

[L6] $n \ne \sigma(n)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[lem-nat-successor-neq-self]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $\mathbb{N}$ is a transitive set. Let $P(n)$ be "$n \subseteq \mathbb{N}$". $P(0)$ holds because $0 = \varnothing$ has no elements. If $n \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ then, since $n$ is itself an element of $\mathbb{N}$, the set $\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$ is also a subset of $\mathbb{N}$, so $P(\sigma(n))$ holds. By induction $n \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, which is the transitivity of $\mathbb{N}$. [given, L1]

1.2 For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ one has $n \in \sigma(n)$ and $n < \sigma(n)$. Indeed $n \in n \cup \{n\} = \sigma(n)$ directly; and taking $k = \sigma(0)$ gives $n + \sigma(0) = \sigma(n + 0) = \sigma(n)$, so $n \le \sigma(n)$, while $n \ne \sigma(n)$, whence $n < \sigma(n)$. [given, L2, L6]

1.3 Mixed transitivity, in both directions. (i) If $m \le n$ and $n < p$ then $m < p$: transitivity of $\le$ gives $m \le p$; if $m = p$ then $p \le n$, and $n \le p$ holds because $n < p$, so antisymmetry gives $n = p$, contradicting $n \ne p$. Hence $m \ne p$ and $m < p$. (ii) If $m < n$ and $n \le p$ then $m < p$: transitivity of $\le$ again gives $m \le p$; if $m = p$ then $n \le p = m$, and $m \le n$ holds because $m < n$, so antisymmetry gives $m = n$, contradicting $m \ne n$. Hence $m \ne p$ and $m < p$. [given, L3]

1.4 No natural number satisfies $m < 0$. For every $m$ one has $0 + m = m$, so $0 \le m$; if also $m \le 0$ then antisymmetry gives $m = 0$, and $m < 0$ additionally demands $m \ne 0$. [given, L2, L3]

2.1 For all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$: $m < \sigma(n) \iff m \le n$. If $m \le n$ then, with $n < \sigma(n)$ from step 1.2, step 1.3(i) gives $m < \sigma(n)$. Conversely assume $m < \sigma(n)$ and suppose $m \le n$ fails; then $n < m$ by trichotomy, so $\sigma(n) \le m$ by discreteness, and step 1.3(i) applied to $\sigma(n) \le m$ and $m < \sigma(n)$ gives $\sigma(n) < \sigma(n)$, which irreflexivity forbids. Hence $m \le n$. [step 1.2, step 1.3, given, L3, L4]

2.2 Membership implies order: for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, every $m \in n$ satisfies $m < n$. Let $P(n)$ be that statement; $P(0)$ is vacuous since $0 = \varnothing$. Assume $P(n)$ and let $m \in \sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$. If $m \in n$ then $m < n$ by $P(n)$, and $n < \sigma(n)$ by step 1.2, so $m < \sigma(n)$ by step 1.3(i), whose hypothesis $m \le n$ follows from $m < n$. If $m = n$ then $m < \sigma(n)$ by step 1.2. So $P(\sigma(n))$ holds, and by induction $P(n)$ holds for every $n$; the elements $m$ involved are natural numbers by step 1.1, so the statement is about $\mathbb{N}$ throughout. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, given, L1]

3.1 Order implies membership: for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, every $m \in \mathbb{N}$ with $m < n$ satisfies $m \in n$. Let $Q(n)$ be that statement; $Q(0)$ holds vacuously by step 1.4. Assume $Q(n)$ and let $m < \sigma(n)$. By step 2.1, $m \le n$, that is $m < n$ or $m = n$. In the first case $m \in n$ by $Q(n)$; in the second $m \in \{n\}$. Either way $m \in n \cup \{n\} = \sigma(n)$, so $Q(\sigma(n))$ holds, and by induction $Q(n)$ holds for every $n$. [step 1.4, step 2.1, given, L1]

4.1 Steps 2.2 and 3.1 together give $m < n \iff m \in n$ for all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, which is claim 1; and since every element of $n$ is a natural number by step 1.1, this says exactly $n = \{\, m \in \mathbb{N} : m < n \,\}$. [step 1.1, step 2.2, step 3.1]

5.1 If $m \le n$ then $m \subseteq n$: let $x \in m$; then $x \in \mathbb{N}$ by step 1.1 and $x < m$ by step 4.1, so $x < n$ by step 1.3(ii) applied to $x < m$ and $m \le n$, whence $x \in n$ by step 4.1. [step 1.1, step 1.3, step 4.1]

5.2 If $m \subseteq n$ then $m \le n$: suppose $m \le n$ fails; then $n < m$ by trichotomy, so $n \in m$ by step 4.1, and $m \subseteq n$ would give $n \in n$, which is impossible. Hence $m \le n$. [step 4.1, L3, L5]

5.3 For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ one has $0 \le n$ by step 1.4; if in addition $n \ne 0$ then $0 < n$, hence $0 \in n$ by step 4.1. [step 1.4, step 4.1, given]

6.1 The transitivity of $\mathbb{N}$ is step 1.1, claim 1 is step 4.1, claim 2 is steps 5.1 and 5.2 together, claim 3 is steps 1.2 and 2.1, and claim 4 is step 5.3; the description $n = \{\, m \in \mathbb{N} : m < n \,\}$ is part of step 4.1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.1, step 4.1, step 5.1, step 5.2, step 5.3] ∎

## Remarks

- Nothing here is circular. The order used throughout is the additive one of [[def-nat-order]], and every fact quoted about it, linearity ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]), trichotomy ([[lem-nat-trichotomy]]) and discreteness ([[lem-nat-discrete]]), is proved on the naturals page from addition and induction, with no appeal to membership. The two set-theoretic inputs, that each $n$ is transitive with $n \notin n$ ([[lem-nat-transitive-irreflexive]]), are likewise proved there by induction on the von Neumann encoding alone.

- Step 5.2 is where irreflexivity of membership does real work: without $n \notin n$ the inclusion $m \subseteq n$ would not exclude $n < m$.

- **The duplication with the ordinals page is deliberate.** There, membership is made the order by fiat: [[def-ordinal]] *defines* $\alpha < \beta$ to mean $\alpha \in \beta$, and [[lem-omega-least-limit-ordinal]] then re-derives claim 1 while identifying $\mathbb{N}$ with the ordinals below $\omega$. That page comes far later in the library, so nothing here may cite it without circularity, and building the ordinals would be a very expensive way to obtain a fact this page needs only for the naturals. The two proofs are independent and agree.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$. For
every $a \in F$ with $a \neq 0$ we have $a^2 > 0$, where $a^2 = a \cdot a$. In
particular, every nonzero square is positive.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and an element $a \in F$ with $a \neq 0$.

[L1] $x > 0 \iff x \in P$, and by trichotomy for $a \neq 0$ exactly one of $a \in P$, $-a \in P$ holds ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] $P$ is closed under multiplication: if $u, v \in P$ then $uv \in P$ (axiom O2 of [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] In any field, $(-u)(-v) = uv$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Since $a \neq 0$, trichotomy leaves exactly two possibilities: $a \in P$ or $-a \in P$. [L1]

2.1 Case $a > 0$: then $a \in P$, so closure gives $a \cdot a \in P$, i.e. $a^2 > 0$. [assume-case pos, step 1.1, L2, L1]

2.2 Case $a < 0$: then $-a \in P$, so closure gives $(-a)(-a) \in P$; since $(-a)(-a) = a \cdot a = a^2$ by L3, we get $a^2 \in P$, i.e. $a^2 > 0$. [assume-case neg, step 1.1, L2, L3, L1]

3.1 The cases $a > 0$ and $a < 0$ exhaust all of $a \neq 0$ by trichotomy, and both yield $a^2 > 0$. [cases-exhaustive, step 2.1, step 2.2] ∎

## Statement

Let $a, b$ be elements of a field ([[def-field]]) and let integer powers be as in
[[def-integer-power]].

1. For all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$: $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$.
2. If $a \ne 0$ then $a^n \ne 0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and $a^{-m} = (a^m)^{-1}$ for every $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ ([[def-int-operations]]).
3. If $a \ne 0$ and $b \ne 0$ then all three identities of claim 1 hold for all $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Elements $a, b$ of a field $F$, naturals $m, n, p, q, k$ and integers ranged over by $m, n$ in claims 2 and 3.

[L1] Definition of powers ([[def-integer-power]]): $a^0 = 1$ and $a^{n+1} = a^n a$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$; and $a^{-n} := (a^n)^{-1}$ for $a \ne 0$ and $n \ge 1$, the two clauses agreeing at $n = 0$.

[L2] Induction principle ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L3] Field arithmetic: multiplication is associative and commutative with identity $1$, and every nonzero element has an inverse ([[def-field]]); inverses are unique ([[lem-of-inverse-unique]], which states uniqueness and nothing further), and HENCE, for $x, y \ne 0$, $(xy)^{-1} = x^{-1} y^{-1}$ and $(x^{-1})^{-1} = x$, since $(xy)(x^{-1}y^{-1}) = 1$ and $x^{-1}x = 1$ exhibit inverses that uniqueness then identifies.

[L4] A field has no zero divisors: $xy = 0$ implies $x = 0$ or $y = 0$ ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]).

[L5] $\mathbb{Z}$ is a commutative ring in which every element is $\iota(k)$ or $-\iota(k)$ for a unique natural $k$ ([[thm-int-comm-ring]], [[lem-nat-embeds-int]], [[def-int-operations]]); we write $k$ for $\iota(k)$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base cases at $n = 0$ for the addition law, the product law and nonvanishing: $a^{m+0} = a^m = a^m \cdot 1 = a^m a^0$ for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$; $(ab)^0 = 1 = 1 \cdot 1 = a^0 b^0$; and if $a \ne 0$ then $a^0 = 1 \ne 0$. [base, L1, L3]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$ for all $m \in \mathbb{N}$, $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$, and $a^n \ne 0$ whenever $a \ne 0$. The iterated-power law $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ is deliberately NOT carried in this hypothesis: its successor step needs the addition law at the exponent pair $(mn, m)$, whose second entry is not the current stage, so that law must be finished first and the iterated law proved afterwards. [ih]

1.3 For $a \ne 0$ and every integer $j$, $a^{-j} = (a^j)^{-1}$: for $j \ge 0$ this is the definition together with the agreement of the two clauses at $j = 0$, and for $j = -k$ with $k \ge 1$ it reads $a^{k} = (a^{-k})^{-1}$, which holds because $a^{-k} = (a^k)^{-1}$ and $(x^{-1})^{-1} = x$ at $x = a^{k}$. That last substitution needs $a^{k} \ne 0$, which is NOT free here and must not be read off the definition, since the definition of the negative clause is what is being justified; it is instead a self-contained induction on $k$, from $a^{0} = 1 \ne 0$ and the fact that $a^{k+1} = a^{k}a$ is a product of two nonzero elements of a field, hence nonzero. [L1, L2, L3, L4, L5]

2.1 Successor step for the addition law, the product law and nonvanishing: $a^{m+(n+1)} = a^{(m+n)+1} = a^{m+n} a = (a^m a^n) a = a^m (a^n a) = a^m a^{n+1}$ for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$; $(ab)^{n+1} = (ab)^n (ab) = (a^n b^n)(ab) = (a^n a)(b^n b) = a^{n+1} b^{n+1}$; and if $a \ne 0$ then $a^{n+1} = a^n a$ is a product of two nonzero elements, hence nonzero. [step 1.2, L1, L3, L4]

3.1 By the induction principle, for all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$: $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$, and $a^n \ne 0$ whenever $a \ne 0$. The addition law is thereby available at EVERY pair of natural exponents, which is exactly what the iterated-power law needs. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L2]

4.1 The iterated-power law for natural exponents, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$, by a second induction on $n$ with $m \in \mathbb{N}$ fixed: at $n = 0$ both sides are $1$, since $(a^m)^0 = 1 = a^0 = a^{m \cdot 0}$; and if $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ then $(a^m)^{n+1} = (a^m)^n a^m = a^{mn} a^m = a^{mn+m} = a^{m(n+1)}$, where the third equality is the addition law of step 3.1 at the pair $(mn, m)$, legitimate precisely because that law is by now proved for all pairs of naturals. This completes claim 1. [step 3.1, L1, L2, L3]

4.2 For $a \ne 0$ and every integer $j$, $a^{j+1} = a^j a$: for $j \ge 0$ this is the recursion clause, and for $j = -k$ with $k \ge 1$ we compute $a^{-k} a = (a^k)^{-1} a = (a^{k-1} a)^{-1} a = (a^{k-1})^{-1} a^{-1} a = (a^{k-1})^{-1} = a^{-(k-1)} = a^{-k+1}$. [step 3.1, step 1.3, L1, L3]

4.3 For $a, b \ne 0$ the product law holds for all integers $n$: for $n \ge 0$ it is step 3.1, and for $n = -k$ with $k \ge 1$ we get $(ab)^{-k} = ((ab)^k)^{-1} = (a^k b^k)^{-1} = (a^k)^{-1}(b^k)^{-1} = a^{-k} b^{-k}$. [step 3.1, step 1.3, L3, L5]

5.1 For $a \ne 0$, every integer $j$ and every natural $k$, $a^{j+k} = a^j a^k$, by induction on $k$: the case $k = 0$ is $a^j = a^j \cdot 1$, and if $a^{j+k} = a^j a^k$ then $a^{j+k+1} = a^{j+k} a = a^j a^k a = a^j a^{k+1}$ by step 4.2 applied to the integer $j+k$ and by the recursion clause. [step 4.2, L1, L2, L3]

6.1 For $a \ne 0$ the addition law holds for all integers $m, n$: writing $n = k$ or $n = -k$ with $k \in \mathbb{N}$, the case $n = k$ is step 5.1, while for $n = -k$ step 5.1 applied to the integer $m - k$ gives $a^m = a^{(m-k)+k} = a^{m-k} a^k$, hence $a^{m-k} = a^m (a^k)^{-1} = a^m a^{-k}$. [step 5.1, step 1.3, L3, L5]

7.1 For $a \ne 0$ the iterated-power law holds for all integers $m, n$: for $n \ge 0$ induction on $n$ gives $(a^m)^{n+1} = (a^m)^n a^m = a^{mn} a^m = a^{mn+m} = a^{m(n+1)}$, the third equality by the integer addition law of step 6.1 at the pair $(mn, m)$, with base $(a^m)^0 = 1 = a^0$; and for $n = -q$ with $q \ge 1$, $(a^m)^{-q} = ((a^m)^q)^{-1} = (a^{mq})^{-1} = a^{-mq} = a^{m(-q)}$, using that $a^m \ne 0$ by step 3.1 and step 1.3. [step 6.1, step 3.1, step 1.3, L2, L3, L5]

8.1 Claims 1, 2 and 3 are therefore established: the addition, product and iterated-power laws for natural exponents together with nonvanishing by steps 3.1 and 4.1, the identity $a^{-m} = (a^m)^{-1}$ by step 1.3, and the three integer-exponent laws by steps 6.1, 4.3 and 7.1. [step 3.1, step 4.1, step 1.3, step 6.1, step 4.3, step 7.1, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]), let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $F^{n}$ be the
function space on the von Neumann natural $n = \{0, \dots, n-1\}$, with the
pointwise operations ([[def-function-space]], [[def-natural-numbers]],
[[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]). For $i < n$ define the **standard unit vector**
$e_i \in F^{n}$ by

$$e_i(i) = 1_F, \qquad e_i(j) = 0_F \ \text{ for } j < n \text{ with } j \ne i .$$

Then:

1. **Finite sums in a function space are pointwise.** For every set $X$, every
   $p \in \mathbb{N}$, every list $u : p \to F^{X}$ and every $j \in X$,
   $$\Bigl(\sum_{k<p} u_k\Bigr)(j) \;=\; \sum_{k<p} u_k(j),$$
   the right-hand sum being taken in $(F,+,0_F)$. (Stated here for an arbitrary
   $X$ because the companion page needs it at $X = \mathbb{N}$.)
2. $e : n \to F^{n}$ is an ordered basis of $F^{n}$ ([[def-linear-basis]]); in
   particular $e$ is injective and its image $e[n] = \{\, e_i : i < n \,\}$ is a
   basis of $F^{n}$ with $e[n] \approx n$ ([[def-equinumerous]]);
3. for every $\lambda : n \to F$ and every $j < n$,
   $\bigl(\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i e_i\bigr)(j) = \lambda_j$; equivalently the
   coordinate list of $x \in F^{n}$ with respect to the ordered basis $e$
   ([[thm-unique-coordinates-with-respect-to-an-ordered-basis]]) is
   $i \mapsto x(i)$;
4. $F^{n}$ is finite-dimensional over $F$ with $\dim_F F^{n} = n$
   ([[def-dimension]]);
5. at $n = 0$ this reads: $F^{0}$ has exactly one element, the empty function,
   so $F^{0}$ is the zero space, the empty list is its ordered basis,
   $\varnothing$ is its basis and $\dim_F F^{0} = 0$.

Every index runs from $0$, so the coordinates of an element of $F^{n}$ are
$x_0, \dots, x_{n-1}$ and no statement above is restricted to $n \ge 1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A field $F$, a natural number $n$, the vector space $F^{n}$ with pointwise operations, and the vectors $e_i$ for $i < n$.

[L1] $F^{X}$ is a vector space over $F$ with $(x+y)(j) = x(j)+y(j)$, $(\lambda x)(j) = \lambda\,x(j)$ and zero the constant function at $0_F$; two elements are equal exactly when they agree at every point; and $F^{0}$ has exactly one element, the empty function, which is $0_{F^{0}}$ ([[def-function-space]], [[def-vector-space]]).

[L2] Finite sums: $\sum_{k<0}u_k$ is the zero vector and $\sum_{k<\sigma(p)}u_k = \bigl(\sum_{k<p}u_k\bigr) + u_p$, in any vector space ([[def-monoid-finite-product]], [[def-linear-combination-and-span]]).

[L3] $F$ is a vector space over itself, with the field addition and multiplication ([[lem-restriction-of-scalars]], claim 1), so the finite sums of $\mathbb{N}$-indexed lists of scalars are available in $(F,+,0_F)$ and satisfy (F1) and (F3); in particular a list of scalars vanishing off a single index sums to its value at that index ([[def-sum-of-linear-subspaces]]).

[L4] In $F$: $\lambda 1_F = \lambda$ and $\lambda 0_F = 0_F$ for every $\lambda \in F$ ([[def-field]], [[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]]).

[L5] A list $v : n \to V$ is an ordered basis of $V$ if and only if every $x \in V$ is $\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i v_i$ for exactly one $\lambda : n \to F$; an ordered basis is injective and its image is a basis with $v[n] \approx n$ ([[thm-unique-coordinates-with-respect-to-an-ordered-basis]], [[def-linear-basis]], [[def-linear-independence]], [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L6] $\dim_F V$ is the unique $p \in \mathbb{N}$ with a basis $B \approx p$, defined when $V$ has a finite basis ([[def-dimension]], [[def-countable]]).

[L7] Induction on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Claim 1, that a finite sum in $F^{X}$ is computed pointwise: for every $p \in \mathbb{N}$, every list $u : p \to F^{X}$ and every $j \in X$, $\bigl(\sum_{k<p}u_k\bigr)(j) = \sum_{k<p}u_k(j)$, the right-hand sum being taken in $(F,+,0_F)$. By induction on $p$: at $p = 0$ the left side is the value at $j$ of the constant function $0_F$ and the right side is the empty sum $0_F$; and if it holds at $p$, then $\bigl(\sum_{k<\sigma(p)}u_k\bigr)(j) = \bigl(\sum_{k<p}u_k + u_p\bigr)(j) = \bigl(\sum_{k<p}u_k\bigr)(j) + u_p(j) = \sum_{k<p}u_k(j) + u_p(j) = \sum_{k<\sigma(p)}u_k(j)$, using pointwise addition and the recursion. [L1, L2, L3, L7]

2.1 Evaluating a combination of the $e_i$. Let $\lambda : n \to F$ and $j < n$. By step 1.1 and pointwise scalar multiplication, $\bigl(\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i e_i\bigr)(j) = \sum_{i<n}(\lambda_i e_i)(j) = \sum_{i<n}\lambda_i\, e_i(j)$. The list of scalars $i \mapsto \lambda_i\,e_i(j)$ takes the value $\lambda_i 0_F = 0_F$ at every $i \ne j$ and the value $\lambda_j 1_F = \lambda_j$ at $i = j$, so it vanishes off the single index $j$ and therefore sums to $\lambda_j$. Hence $\bigl(\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i e_i\bigr)(j) = \lambda_j$ for every $j < n$. [step 1.1, L1, L3, L4]

3.1 Existence and uniqueness of coordinates. Given $x \in F^{n}$, put $\lambda_i := x(i)$; by step 2.1 the vectors $\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i e_i$ and $x$ agree at every $j < n$, hence are equal. And if $\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i e_i = \sum_{i<n}\mu_i e_i$, then evaluating both sides at $j$ and using step 2.1 gives $\lambda_j = \mu_j$ for every $j < n$. So every $x \in F^{n}$ is $\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i e_i$ for exactly one $\lambda : n \to F$. [step 2.1, L1]

4.1 Claims 2 and 3. Step 2.1 is claim 3, and by the coordinate characterisation of an ordered basis, step 3.1 says exactly that $e$ is an ordered basis of $F^{n}$; hence $e$ is injective, $e[n]$ is a basis of $F^{n}$, and $e[n] \approx n$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L5]

5.1 Claims 4 and 5. By step 4.1 the space $F^{n}$ has a basis with $n$ elements, so it is finite-dimensional and $\dim_F F^{n} = n$. At $n = 0$ the space $F^{0}$ has exactly one element, the empty function, which is its zero vector, so $F^{0}$ is the zero space; the list $e$ is then the empty list, its image is $\varnothing$, and $\dim_F F^{0} = 0$. [step 4.1, L1, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- **The indices start at $0$ because a natural number is the set of its predecessors.** $F^{n}$ is the function space $F^{X}$ at $X = n = \{0,\dots,n-1\}$ ([[def-function-space]], [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]), so an element of $F^{n}$ is a function on $\{0,\dots,n-1\}$ and there is no $e_n$. Reading the standard basis off a $1$-indexed source would put a vector outside the space at one end and lose one at the other.

- **Step 1.1 is not a triviality to be skipped.** That a finite sum of functions is the pointwise finite sum is a statement about the recursion defining [[def-monoid-finite-product]] in two different monoids, and it is proved by induction. Every evaluation argument on this page and on the companion page rests on it.

- **This is the concrete counterweight to [[cor-every-vector-space-has-a-basis]].** Here a basis is written down and no choice principle is used anywhere; there a basis is produced by Zorn's lemma and none is exhibited. The companion page carries both extremes for infinite-dimensional spaces as well: an explicit infinite basis for the eventually zero families, and a basis of $\mathbb{R}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ that no argument exhibits.

## 1. The standing hypothesis $n \ge 1$, and exactly where it comes from

The published [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] defines $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ together with the
metrics $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_\infty$ **only for $n \ge 1$**, and says why: at $n = 0$
the value $d_\infty(x,y)$ would be a maximum over the empty index set, which does
not exist. Everything downstream of that item inherits the hypothesis, and this
page inherits it too. In particular [[thm-euclidean-space-complete]] and
[[thm-heine-borel-rn]] are stated for $n \ge 1$ and **are never cited here for
all $n$**.

**The boundary runs between the algebra and the metric, not where a reader would
guess.** The following items of this page carry no hypothesis on the dimension:

- [[def-norm-and-normed-space]] — including the observation that the zero space
  carries exactly one norm;
- [[def-euclidean-inner-product]], whose sum is the empty sum at $n = 0$;
- [[thm-cauchy-schwarz-and-the-euclidean-norm]], all four of whose clauses hold
  for every $n$, apart from the closing sentence of clause 2 identifying the
  induced metric with $d_2$;
- [[def-equivalent-norms]], which is about an arbitrary real vector space;
- clause 1 of [[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]], that
  each $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$ with rational $p \ge 1$ is a norm;
- clause 1 of [[lem-every-norm-on-rn-is-continuous-for-the-euclidean-metric]],
  the finite and reverse triangle inequalities for a norm on any real vector
  space.

The remaining items all carry $n \ge 1$ (or $m \ge 1$ for the codomain of a
vector-valued function), and each states it in its own Statement:
[[def-p-norms-on-rn]] for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$; clauses 2 and 3 of
[[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]]; clauses 2, 3, 4 of
[[lem-every-norm-on-rn-is-continuous-for-the-euclidean-metric]];
[[thm-all-norms-on-rn-are-equivalent]];
[[thm-componentwise-convergence-and-completeness]];
[[cor-bolzano-weierstrass-in-rn]];
[[def-vector-valued-functions-limits-and-continuity]];
[[thm-componentwise-limits-and-continuity]];
[[def-vector-valued-derivative-and-integral]];
[[thm-norm-inequality-for-the-vector-valued-integral]];
[[thm-mean-value-inequality]];
[[cor-vector-valued-ftc-and-lipschitz-bound]];
[[def-series-of-vectors-and-rearrangement]];
[[thm-absolute-convergence-in-rn]];
[[def-the-space-of-summing-directions]];
[[thm-steinitz-polygonal-confinement]]; and
[[thm-rearrangement-sums-lie-in-an-affine-subspace]].

Where a statement about $n = 0$ is nevertheless true, it is proved here from
scratch rather than imported: see the second remark of
[[thm-componentwise-convergence-and-completeness]] for completeness of
$\mathbb{R}^{0}$.

## 2. The exponent of a $p$-norm is rational

[[def-rational-power]] supplies $a^{r}$ for a nonnegative base and a **rational**
exponent, and real exponents do not exist at this point in the reading order;
[[rem-real-exponents-deferred]] records why. Consequently
[[def-p-norms-on-rn]] defines $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$ for rational $p \ge 1$ only,
and the published Minkowski inequality it rests on is itself stated for rational
$p$. **No statement on this page is written with $p$ ranging over a real
interval**, and the phrase "for $p \in [1,\infty)$" appears nowhere.

## 3. $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a function space

$\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the set of functions $n \to \mathbb{R}$
([[def-function-space]], [[lem-metrics-on-rn]]), so $\mathbb{R}^{1}$ is **not
literally** $\mathbb{R}$: its elements are functions on the one-element set $1$.
Every comparison on this page between the theory in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and the
published one-dimensional theory therefore goes through the isometric bijection
$\theta : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^{1}$ sending $t$ to the function with value
$t$ at $0$, and each item that makes such a comparison states the identification
explicitly: [[cor-bolzano-weierstrass-in-rn]],
[[def-vector-valued-functions-limits-and-continuity]],
[[def-series-of-vectors-and-rearrangement]] and
[[thm-rearrangement-sums-lie-in-an-affine-subspace]]. Coordinates are indexed
from $0$ throughout, as [[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]] fixes.

## 4. What is taken up elsewhere in the reading order

Each item below is a statement about **where material sits in this library's
reading order**, and none of them is a claim about mathematics that this library
denies.

- **Linear maps, the operator norm, and "a linear map between finite-dimensional
  normed spaces is Lipschitz".** Abstract linear maps are defined on the earlier
  linear-algebra page in [[def-linear-map]]. This page neither defines an
  operator norm nor proves that every linear map between finite-dimensional
  normed spaces is Lipschitz. The later total-derivative treatment uses a
  concrete Euclidean formulation; identifying that formulation with the
  abstract definition requires an explicit agreement argument rather than a
  second silent meaning of "linear map".
- **Inner product spaces and orthogonality.** [[def-euclidean-inner-product]]
  defines the concrete Euclidean form on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and claims nothing
  about abstract inner product spaces: orthonormal bases, Gram-Schmidt,
  orthogonal projection, orthogonal complements of arbitrary subspaces and the
  decomposition $V = W \oplus W^{\perp}$ all belong to a page earlier in the plan
  order that is not yet built. **In particular nothing on this page asserts that
  $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the direct sum of $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma^{\perp}$**
  ([[def-the-space-of-summing-directions]]).
- **Uniform convergence, the total derivative, and integration over subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}^{n}$** all come later in this track.
- **The classical mean value witness.** The crispest counterexample to the
  equality form of the mean value theorem for vector-valued functions is
  $t \mapsto (\cos t, \sin t)$ on $[0,2\pi]$. The trigonometric functions are
  introduced later in the reading order than this page, so the companion page
  uses the polynomial curve $t \mapsto (t^{2},t^{3})$ on $[0,1]$ instead. The
  substitution is recorded in the companion item that carries the witness, not
  here, so that a reader meeting the polynomial curve is told at once why the
  classical one is absent; the theorem whose equality form it refutes is
  [[thm-mean-value-inequality]].

## 5. The open half of the rearrangement question

[[thm-rearrangement-sums-lie-in-an-affine-subspace]] proves that the set
$\mathcal{S}(x)$ of rearrangement sums of a convergent series in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
is nonempty and **contained in** the affine subspace $s + \Gamma^{\perp}$, and
[[thm-steinitz-polygonal-confinement]] proves Steinitz's polygonal confinement
lemma in full. **The reverse inclusion is not proved on this page, and this page
asserts nothing about it in either direction, for any $n \ge 2$.** No
recorded-not-proved item has been created for it either.

The obstruction is machinery and not effort. Every route to the reverse inclusion
known to the author of this page reduces first to the case $\Gamma = \{0\}$ by an
orthogonal projection, which needs the orthogonal decomposition named in §4, and
then runs a separation argument for convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, which
exists nowhere in this library and is owned by no planned page. When both exist,
the discharge is an **addition to this page**, not a new page.

The published [[rem-rearrangement-in-higher-dimensions]] raised this question on
the series page and declined to state what the literature answers; this page
answers the part it can and continues to decline the rest. What a reader is
protected from meanwhile is the wrong guess: the companion page refutes outright
the naive $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ analogue of the Riemann series theorem, using the
containment half and nothing more.

## 6. A naming collision worth stating once

[[thm-steinitz-polygonal-confinement]] is Steinitz's polygonal confinement lemma
from his 1913 paper on conditionally convergent series. It is **not** the
Steinitz exchange lemma of linear algebra, which is published in this library
under the id `thm-steinitz-exchange` and additionally carries the alias
`lem-steinitz`. The two are different theorems by the same author; the ids do not
collide, and no item on this page uses the bare alias.

## Statement

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$, with the Euclidean
inner product and the Euclidean norm as in [[def-euclidean-inner-product]]. Then:

1. **Cauchy-Schwarz.**
   $$\lvert\langle x,y\rangle\rvert \;\le\; \lVert x\rVert_2\,\lVert y\rVert_2 ,$$
   with equality if and only if there is a pair $(\lambda,\mu) \ne (0,0)$ of
   reals with $\lambda x_k = \mu y_k$ for every $k < n$.
2. **$\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ is a norm on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$**
   ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]), for **every** $n \in \mathbb{N}$; the metric
   it induces is $d_2$ of [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] whenever $n \ge 1$.
3. **Parallelogram law.**
   $$\lVert x+y\rVert_2^{2} + \lVert x-y\rVert_2^{2} \;=\; 2\lVert x\rVert_2^{2} + 2\lVert y\rVert_2^{2} .$$
4. **Polarisation.**
   $$\langle x,y\rangle \;=\; \tfrac14\Bigl(\lVert x+y\rVert_2^{2} - \lVert x-y\rVert_2^{2}\Bigr),$$
   so the inner product is recovered from the norm it induces.

**Clause 1 is a citation, not a new proof.** The inequality and its equality case
are the published [[thm-cauchy-schwarz-finite]], stated there for two lists of
reals; all that happens below is that it is read in the vector notation of
[[def-euclidean-inner-product]]. Re-proving it here would put two proofs of one
statement in the library.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural number $n$ and vectors $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$, so that $\langle x,y\rangle = \sum_{k<n}x_ky_k$ and $\lVert x\rVert_2 = \sqrt{\langle x,x\rangle}$ ([[def-euclidean-inner-product]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[L1] Cauchy-Schwarz for finite sums ([[thm-cauchy-schwarz-finite]]): $\bigl(\sum_{k<n}a_kb_k\bigr)^{2} \le \bigl(\sum_{k<n}a_k^{2}\bigr)\bigl(\sum_{k<n}b_k^{2}\bigr)$, with equality if and only if there is $(\lambda,\mu) \ne (0,0)$ with $\lambda a_k = \mu b_k$ for every $k<n$; and the root form $\bigl|\sum_{k<n}a_kb_k\bigr| \le \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}a_k^{2}}\sqrt{\sum_{k<n}b_k^{2}}$.

[L2] The inner product is symmetric, bilinear and positive definite, $\langle x,x\rangle = \sum_{k<n}x_k^{2} \ge 0$, and $\langle x,x\rangle = 0$ exactly when $x = 0$ ([[def-euclidean-inner-product]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L3] Square roots ([[thm-of-square-roots]]): every $c \ge 0$ has a unique $s \ge 0$ with $s^{2} = c$, written $\sqrt{c}$; hence $\lVert x\rVert_2 \ge 0$ and $\lVert x\rVert_2^{2} = \langle x,x\rangle$ ([[def-integer-power]]).

[L4] Squaring is monotone on the nonnegatives: for $a,b \ge 0$, $a \le b$ if and only if $a^{2} \le b^{2}$, and $a = b$ if and only if $a^{2} = b^{2}$ ([[lem-of-square-monotone]]).

[L5] Absolute value ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]]): $|t| \ge 0$, $|t|^{2} = t^{2}$, and $|st| = |s|\,|t|$.

[L6] The norm axioms (N1), (N2), (N3) ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]), and the fact that $d_2(u,v) = \lVert u-v\rVert_2$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]], [[def-euclidean-inner-product]] clause 6).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Instantiating [L1] at $a_k := x_k$ and $b_k := y_k$ gives $\langle x,y\rangle^{2} \le \langle x,x\rangle\,\langle y,y\rangle$, with equality exactly when some $(\lambda,\mu) \ne (0,0)$ has $\lambda x_k = \mu y_k$ for every $k<n$. [L1, L2]

1.2 Both $\lvert\langle x,y\rangle\rvert$ and $\lVert x\rVert_2\lVert y\rVert_2$ are nonnegative, and their squares are $\langle x,y\rangle^{2}$ and $\langle x,x\rangle\langle y,y\rangle$. [L3, L5]

1.3 Expanding by bilinearity and symmetry, $\langle x+y, x+y\rangle = \langle x,x\rangle + \langle x,y\rangle + \langle y,x\rangle + \langle y,y\rangle = \lVert x\rVert_2^{2} + 2\langle x,y\rangle + \lVert y\rVert_2^{2}$. [L2, L3]

1.4 The same expansion at $x - y = x + (-1)y$ gives $\lVert x-y\rVert_2^{2} = \lVert x\rVert_2^{2} - 2\langle x,y\rangle + \lVert y\rVert_2^{2}$. [L2, L3]

1.5 For a scalar $\lambda$, $\langle \lambda x, \lambda x\rangle = \lambda^{2}\langle x,x\rangle = |\lambda|^{2}\lVert x\rVert_2^{2}$, so $\lVert \lambda x\rVert_2^{2} = \bigl(|\lambda|\lVert x\rVert_2\bigr)^{2}$. [L2, L3, L5]

1.6 Axiom (N1) holds: $\lVert x\rVert_2 = 0$ if and only if $\lVert x\rVert_2^{2} = \langle x,x\rangle = 0$, which by positive definiteness says $x = 0$. [L2, L3, L4]

2.1 Comparing the squares of step 1.2 through step 1.1 and using monotonicity of squaring on the nonnegatives yields $\lvert\langle x,y\rangle\rvert \le \lVert x\rVert_2\lVert y\rVert_2$, with equality exactly in the proportional case of step 1.1; this is clause 1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L4]

2.2 Adding the identities of step 1.3 and step 1.4 gives $\lVert x+y\rVert_2^{2} + \lVert x-y\rVert_2^{2} = 2\lVert x\rVert_2^{2} + 2\lVert y\rVert_2^{2}$, which is clause 3. [step 1.3, step 1.4, algebra]

2.3 Subtracting the identity of step 1.4 from that of step 1.3 gives $\lVert x+y\rVert_2^{2} - \lVert x-y\rVert_2^{2} = 4\langle x,y\rangle$, which is clause 4 after dividing by $4$. [step 1.3, step 1.4, algebra]

2.4 Both $\lVert \lambda x\rVert_2$ and $|\lambda|\lVert x\rVert_2$ are nonnegative and by step 1.5 have equal squares, so $\lVert \lambda x\rVert_2 = |\lambda|\lVert x\rVert_2$, which is axiom (N2). [step 1.5, L3, L4, L5]

3.1 By step 2.1 the middle term of step 1.3 satisfies $2\langle x,y\rangle \le 2\lVert x\rVert_2\lVert y\rVert_2$, so $\lVert x+y\rVert_2^{2} \le \lVert x\rVert_2^{2} + 2\lVert x\rVert_2\lVert y\rVert_2 + \lVert y\rVert_2^{2} = \bigl(\lVert x\rVert_2 + \lVert y\rVert_2\bigr)^{2}$. [step 1.3, step 2.1, L5, algebra]

4.1 Both $\lVert x+y\rVert_2$ and $\lVert x\rVert_2 + \lVert y\rVert_2$ are nonnegative, so step 3.1 and monotonicity of squaring give $\lVert x+y\rVert_2 \le \lVert x\rVert_2 + \lVert y\rVert_2$, which is axiom (N3). [step 3.1, L3, L4]

5.1 Steps 2.4, 1.6 and 4.1 are exactly (N1), (N2) and (N3), so $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ is a norm on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and for $n \ge 1$ the metric it induces is $d_2$; this is clause 2, and with steps 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 all four clauses are proved. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, step 1.6, step 4.1, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- **Which route to the triangle inequality was taken.** The proof above obtains (N3) by expanding $\lVert x+y\rVert_2^{2}$ and applying Cauchy-Schwarz. The alternative is to quote [[thm-minkowski-finite]] at the rational exponent $p = 2$, which states the same inequality directly; that route is equally legitimate and is the one [[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]] uses for a general exponent. Only one of the two is used here, so no statement is proved twice.

- **Clause 1 holds at $n = 0$, where it reads $0 \le 0$**, and the equality case is then satisfied by every pair $(\lambda,\mu) \ne (0,0)$, the condition quantifying over no indices. Clause 2 also holds at $n = 0$, the zero space carrying exactly one norm ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]). What is not available at $n = 0$ is the metric $d_2$ of [[lem-metrics-on-rn]], which is why the last sentence of clause 2 carries $n \ge 1$.

- **Clauses 3 and 4 are what the companion page uses.** The parallelogram law is an identity satisfied by every norm of the form $\sqrt{\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle}$, so a norm violating it is not of that form; that is how the companion page rules out $\lVert\cdot\rVert_1$ on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Polarisation says the inner product carries no information the norm does not.

## Statement

Let $F$ be a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]). Then every
$a \in F$ with $a \ge 0$ has a **unique** $s \in F$ with $s \ge 0$ and $s^2 = a$;
we write $s = \sqrt{a}$. Consequently the positive elements of $F$ are exactly the
nonzero squares: $x > 0$ if and only if $x = y^2$ for some $y \neq 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), that is, an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with the least-upper-bound property, and an element $a \in F$ with $a \ge 0$.

[L1] Every nonempty subset of $F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Sign and scaling rules: a product of positives is positive, and for $c > 0$ one has $x < y \iff cx < cy$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

[L3] Squaring is strictly monotone on the nonnegatives: if $0 \le x < y$ then $x^2 < y^2$; in particular squaring is injective on $\{x : x \ge 0\}$ ([[lem-of-square-monotone]]).

[L4] A nonzero square is positive: if $y \neq 0$ then $y^2 > 0$ ([[lem-of-square-positive]]).

[L5] Multiplying inequalities of positives: if $0 < x < y$ and $0 < u < v$ then $xu < yv$ ([[prop-of-multiply-inequalities]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 If $a = 0$, then $s = 0$ satisfies $s \ge 0$ and $s^2 = 0 = a$, so existence holds; assume henceforth $a > 0$. [given, algebra]

1.2 Uniqueness holds once a root exists: if $u, v \ge 0$ satisfy $u^2 = v^2$, then strict monotonicity of squaring on nonnegatives [L3] rules out both $u < v$ and $u > v$, forcing $u = v$; so at most one $s \ge 0$ has $s^2 = a$. [L3, given]

1.3 Define $S = \{ t \in F : t \ge 0 \text{ and } t^2 \le a \}$; then $0 \in S$ because $0 \ge 0$ and $0^2 = 0 \le a$, so $S \neq \emptyset$. [given, algebra]

1.4 The element $1 + a$ is an upper bound of $S$: since $a > 0$ we have $1 + a > 1$, so any $t > 1 + a$ has $t > 1$ and $t > 0$, whence $t^2 = t \cdot t > 1 \cdot t = t > 1 + a > a$, giving $t \notin S$. [given, L2]

2.1 By completeness [L1], $s := \sup S$ exists in $F$; and since $0 \in S$ we have $s \ge 0$. [L1, step 1.3, step 1.4]

3.1 Assume, for contradiction, that $s^2 \neq a$; by trichotomy either $s^2 < a$ or $s^2 > a$. [assume-contra, step 2.1]

4.1 (Case $s^2 < a$.) Choose $h$ with $0 < h < 1$ and $h < \dfrac{a - s^2}{2s + 1}$, possible since $a - s^2 > 0$ and $2s + 1 \ge 1 > 0$; then $h^2 = h \cdot h < h \cdot 1 = h$ and $h(2s+1) < a - s^2$, so $(s+h)^2 = s^2 + 2sh + h^2 < s^2 + 2sh + h = s^2 + h(2s+1) < a$, whence $s + h \in S$ with $s + h > s$, contradicting that $s$ is an upper bound of $S$. [assume-case low, step 3.1, step 2.1, L2, L5, choose]

4.2 (Case $s^2 > a$.) Here $s > 0$ since $s^2 > a \ge 0$; choose $h$ with $0 < h < s$ and $h < \dfrac{s^2 - a}{2s}$, so $2sh < s^2 - a$ and $(s-h)^2 = s^2 - 2sh + h^2 \ge s^2 - 2sh > a$, hence every $t \in S$ has $t^2 \le a < (s-h)^2$ with $t \ge 0$ and $s - h > 0$, so $t < s - h$ by [L3]; thus $s - h$ is an upper bound of $S$ with $s - h < s$, contradicting that $s$ is the least upper bound. [assume-case high, step 3.1, step 2.1, L3, choose]

5.1 Both cases of the disjunction in step 3.1 give a contradiction, so the assumption fails and $s^2 = a$: a unique (by step 1.2) $s = \sqrt{a} \ge 0$ with $s^2 = a$ exists, and applying this to any $x > 0$ writes $x = (\sqrt{x})^2$ with $\sqrt{x} \neq 0$ while conversely any nonzero square is positive by [L4], so the positive elements of $F$ are exactly the nonzero squares. [step 4.1, step 4.2, step 3.1, step 1.2, L4, cases, discharge-contradiction] ∎
