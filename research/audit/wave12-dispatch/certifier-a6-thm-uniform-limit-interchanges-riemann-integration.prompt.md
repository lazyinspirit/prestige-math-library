You are **GPT 5.6 Terra** at `xhigh` effort with a 1,000,000-token context
window. You are an independent, read-only certifier of a repair or source
disposition you did not author.

## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the assigned target's exact current final text from disk and compare its
hash with the dispatch task. For an item, read every dependency needed for the
repaired inference, the title/public statement, every numbered step, Facts &
Assumptions, Remarks, dependency list, provenance tags, sources, and
verification block. Check the named baseline defect is fixed without a new one
and that stale pre-repair judge/audited evidence is absent. Use web access when
an external source is material. For a source-correction task, open the retained
live source(s), compare the cited claim against them, and state whether the
final attribution and provenance class remain exact after the dead redundant
endpoint was removed.

Return exactly:

```text
ITEM: <id>
VERDICT: CERTIFIED | REFUSED | BLOCKED
CURRENT-TEXT: READ
MATHEMATICS: [concise evidence]
CITATIONS: [concise evidence]
METADATA: [provenance/dependencies/stale-verdict disposition]
FINDINGS: NONE | [fatal defect or concrete blocker]
```

Do not suggest optional polishing and do not write a verification stamp.

## Statement

Let $a<b$ be reals. Suppose every $f_k:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$ is Riemann
integrable and $f_k\to f$ uniformly on $[a,b]$. Then $f$ is Riemann
integrable and

$$\int_a^b f_k\longrightarrow\int_a^b f.$$

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a<b$, integrable functions $f_k:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$, and uniform convergence $f_k\to f$.

[A1] Uniform convergence means that for every real $\eta>0$ one index makes $|f_k(x)-f(x)|<\eta$ for every later $k$ and every $x\in[a,b]$ ([[def-pointwise-uniform-and-uniformly-cauchy-convergence]]).

[L1] An integrable function on $[a,b]$ is bounded; conversely, a bounded function $h$ there is Riemann integrable exactly when, for every real $\varepsilon>0$, some partition $P$ satisfies $U(h,P)-L(h,P)<\varepsilon$ ([[def-darboux-integral]], [[thm-riemann-criterion]]).

[L2] Darboux upper and lower sums are finite sums of the subinterval suprema and infima times the subinterval lengths; finite sums preserve inequalities and split and telescope in the usual way ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L3] If two integrable functions differ by at most $\eta$ uniformly, then their integrals differ by at most $\eta(b-a)$ ([[lem-uniform-integral-error-bound]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $\varepsilon>0$ be real, put $\eta:=\varepsilon/(4(b-a))>0$, and choose an index $j$ such that $|f_j(x)-f(x)|<\eta$ for every $x\in[a,b]$. [A1, choose]

1.2 By integrability of $f_j$ and [L1], choose a partition $P$ with $U(f_j,P)-L(f_j,P)<\varepsilon/2$. [L1, choose]

2.1 The integrable function $f_j$ is bounded, say $|f_j(x)|\le M$ on $[a,b]$; then $|f(x)|\le M+\eta$, so $f$ is bounded. [step 1.1, L1, algebra]

3.1 On each subinterval of $P$, step 1.1 gives $\sup f\le\sup f_j+\eta$ and $\inf f\ge\inf f_j-\eta$; these suprema and infima exist by step 2.1. Multiplying by the nonnegative subinterval lengths and summing gives $U(f,P)\le U(f_j,P)+\eta(b-a)$ and $L(f,P)\ge L(f_j,P)-\eta(b-a)$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.1, L2, algebra]

4.1 Therefore $U(f,P)-L(f,P)\le U(f_j,P)-L(f_j,P)+2\eta(b-a)<\varepsilon$, so [L1] makes $f$ integrable. [step 3.1, L1, algebra]

5.1 Now let $\varepsilon>0$ be real and choose $N$ such that $|f_k(x)-f(x)|<\varepsilon/(b-a+1)$ for every $k\ge N$ and every $x\in[a,b]$. [step 4.1, A1, choose]

6.1 For $k\ge N$, both functions are integrable, so [L3] gives $\left|\int_a^b f_k-\int_a^b f\right|\le \varepsilon(b-a)/(b-a+1)<\varepsilon$. [step 4.1, step 5.1, L3, algebra]

7.1 Step 6.1 proves $\int_a^b f_k\to\int_a^b f$, while step 4.1 proves integrability of $f$. [step 4.1, step 6.1] ∎
