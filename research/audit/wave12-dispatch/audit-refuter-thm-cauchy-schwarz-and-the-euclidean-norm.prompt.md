## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` Statement or consumer, actively search for a
counterexample or a failure in the witness or cited generated premise. A false
public claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or
materially inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is
nonfatal.

## Statement

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$, with the Euclidean
inner product and the Euclidean norm as in [[def-euclidean-inner-product]]. Then:

1. **Cauchy-Schwarz.**
   $$\lvert\langle x,y\rangle\rvert \;\le\; \lVert x\rVert_2\,\lVert y\rVert_2 ,$$
   with equality if and only if there is a pair $(\lambda,\mu) \ne (0,0)$ of
   reals with $\lambda x_k = \mu y_k$ for every $k < n$.
2. **$\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ is a norm on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$**
   ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]), for **every** $n \in \mathbb{N}$; the metric
   it induces is $d_2$ of [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] whenever $n \ge 1$.
3. **Parallelogram law.**
   $$\lVert x+y\rVert_2^{2} + \lVert x-y\rVert_2^{2} \;=\; 2\lVert x\rVert_2^{2} + 2\lVert y\rVert_2^{2} .$$
4. **Polarisation.**
   $$\langle x,y\rangle \;=\; \tfrac14\Bigl(\lVert x+y\rVert_2^{2} - \lVert x-y\rVert_2^{2}\Bigr),$$
   so the inner product is recovered from the norm it induces.

**Clause 1 is a citation, not a new proof.** The inequality and its equality case
are the published [[thm-cauchy-schwarz-finite]], stated there for two lists of
reals; all that happens below is that it is read in the vector notation of
[[def-euclidean-inner-product]]. Re-proving it here would put two proofs of one
statement in the library.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural number $n$ and vectors $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$, so that $\langle x,y\rangle = \sum_{k<n}x_ky_k$ and $\lVert x\rVert_2 = \sqrt{\langle x,x\rangle}$ ([[def-euclidean-inner-product]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[L1] Cauchy-Schwarz for finite sums ([[thm-cauchy-schwarz-finite]]): $\bigl(\sum_{k<n}a_kb_k\bigr)^{2} \le \bigl(\sum_{k<n}a_k^{2}\bigr)\bigl(\sum_{k<n}b_k^{2}\bigr)$, with equality if and only if there is $(\lambda,\mu) \ne (0,0)$ with $\lambda a_k = \mu b_k$ for every $k<n$; and the root form $\bigl|\sum_{k<n}a_kb_k\bigr| \le \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}a_k^{2}}\sqrt{\sum_{k<n}b_k^{2}}$.

[L2] The inner product is symmetric, bilinear and positive definite, $\langle x,x\rangle = \sum_{k<n}x_k^{2} \ge 0$, and $\langle x,x\rangle = 0$ exactly when $x = 0$ ([[def-euclidean-inner-product]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L3] Square roots ([[thm-of-square-roots]]): every $c \ge 0$ has a unique $s \ge 0$ with $s^{2} = c$, written $\sqrt{c}$; hence $\lVert x\rVert_2 \ge 0$ and $\lVert x\rVert_2^{2} = \langle x,x\rangle$ ([[def-integer-power]]).

[L4] Squaring is monotone on the nonnegatives: for $a,b \ge 0$, $a \le b$ if and only if $a^{2} \le b^{2}$, and $a = b$ if and only if $a^{2} = b^{2}$ ([[lem-of-square-monotone]]).

[L5] Absolute value ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]]): $|t| \ge 0$, $|t|^{2} = t^{2}$, and $|st| = |s|\,|t|$.

[L6] The norm axioms (N1), (N2), (N3) ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]), and the fact that $d_2(u,v) = \lVert u-v\rVert_2$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]], [[def-euclidean-inner-product]] clause 6).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Instantiating [L1] at $a_k := x_k$ and $b_k := y_k$ gives $\langle x,y\rangle^{2} \le \langle x,x\rangle\,\langle y,y\rangle$, with equality exactly when some $(\lambda,\mu) \ne (0,0)$ has $\lambda x_k = \mu y_k$ for every $k<n$. [L1, L2]

1.2 Both $\lvert\langle x,y\rangle\rvert$ and $\lVert x\rVert_2\lVert y\rVert_2$ are nonnegative, and their squares are $\langle x,y\rangle^{2}$ and $\langle x,x\rangle\langle y,y\rangle$. [L3, L5]

1.3 Expanding by bilinearity and symmetry, $\langle x+y, x+y\rangle = \langle x,x\rangle + \langle x,y\rangle + \langle y,x\rangle + \langle y,y\rangle = \lVert x\rVert_2^{2} + 2\langle x,y\rangle + \lVert y\rVert_2^{2}$. [L2, L3]

1.4 The same expansion at $x - y = x + (-1)y$ gives $\lVert x-y\rVert_2^{2} = \lVert x\rVert_2^{2} - 2\langle x,y\rangle + \lVert y\rVert_2^{2}$. [L2, L3]

1.5 For a scalar $\lambda$, $\langle \lambda x, \lambda x\rangle = \lambda^{2}\langle x,x\rangle = |\lambda|^{2}\lVert x\rVert_2^{2}$, so $\lVert \lambda x\rVert_2^{2} = \bigl(|\lambda|\lVert x\rVert_2\bigr)^{2}$. [L2, L3, L5]

1.6 Axiom (N1) holds: $\lVert x\rVert_2 = 0$ if and only if $\lVert x\rVert_2^{2} = \langle x,x\rangle = 0$, which by positive definiteness says $x = 0$. [L2, L3, L4]

2.1 Comparing the squares of step 1.2 through step 1.1 and using monotonicity of squaring on the nonnegatives yields $\lvert\langle x,y\rangle\rvert \le \lVert x\rVert_2\lVert y\rVert_2$, with equality exactly in the proportional case of step 1.1; this is clause 1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L4]

2.2 Adding the identities of step 1.3 and step 1.4 gives $\lVert x+y\rVert_2^{2} + \lVert x-y\rVert_2^{2} = 2\lVert x\rVert_2^{2} + 2\lVert y\rVert_2^{2}$, which is clause 3. [step 1.3, step 1.4, algebra]

2.3 Subtracting the identity of step 1.4 from that of step 1.3 gives $\lVert x+y\rVert_2^{2} - \lVert x-y\rVert_2^{2} = 4\langle x,y\rangle$, which is clause 4 after dividing by $4$. [step 1.3, step 1.4, algebra]

2.4 Both $\lVert \lambda x\rVert_2$ and $|\lambda|\lVert x\rVert_2$ are nonnegative and by step 1.5 have equal squares, so $\lVert \lambda x\rVert_2 = |\lambda|\lVert x\rVert_2$, which is axiom (N2). [step 1.5, L3, L4, L5]

3.1 By step 2.1 the middle term of step 1.3 satisfies $2\langle x,y\rangle \le 2\lVert x\rVert_2\lVert y\rVert_2$, so $\lVert x+y\rVert_2^{2} \le \lVert x\rVert_2^{2} + 2\lVert x\rVert_2\lVert y\rVert_2 + \lVert y\rVert_2^{2} = \bigl(\lVert x\rVert_2 + \lVert y\rVert_2\bigr)^{2}$. [step 1.3, step 2.1, L5, algebra]

4.1 Both $\lVert x+y\rVert_2$ and $\lVert x\rVert_2 + \lVert y\rVert_2$ are nonnegative, so step 3.1 and monotonicity of squaring give $\lVert x+y\rVert_2 \le \lVert x\rVert_2 + \lVert y\rVert_2$, which is axiom (N3). [step 3.1, L3, L4]

5.1 Steps 2.4, 1.6 and 4.1 are exactly (N1), (N2) and (N3), so $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ is a norm on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and for $n \ge 1$ the metric it induces is $d_2$; this is clause 2, and with steps 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 all four clauses are proved. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, step 1.6, step 4.1, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- **Which route to the triangle inequality was taken.** The proof above obtains (N3) by expanding $\lVert x+y\rVert_2^{2}$ and applying Cauchy-Schwarz. The alternative is to quote [[thm-minkowski-finite]] at the rational exponent $p = 2$, which states the same inequality directly; that route is equally legitimate and is the one [[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]] uses for a general exponent. Only one of the two is used here, so no statement is proved twice.

- **Clause 1 holds at $n = 0$, where it reads $0 \le 0$**, and the equality case is then satisfied by every pair $(\lambda,\mu) \ne (0,0)$, the condition quantifying over no indices. Clause 2 also holds at $n = 0$, the zero space carrying exactly one norm ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]). What is not available at $n = 0$ is the metric $d_2$ of [[lem-metrics-on-rn]], which is why the last sentence of clause 2 carries $n \ge 1$.

- **Clauses 3 and 4 are what the companion page uses.** The parallelogram law is an identity satisfied by every norm of the form $\sqrt{\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle}$, so a norm violating it is not of that form; that is how the companion page rules out $\lVert\cdot\rVert_1$ on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Polarisation says the inner product carries no information the norm does not.

A natural number is a von Neumann natural, that is a set, and $n = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]], [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]), so $$\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\;=\\; \\{\\, x \\;:\\; x \\text{ is a function } n \\to \\mathbb{R} \\,\\}$$ is the function space of [[def-function-space]] at $F = \\mathbb{R}$ and $X = n$, a vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$ under the pointwise operations ([[def-vector-space]]). We write $x_k := x(k)$ for $k < n$, and two elements of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are equal exactly when they agree at every $k < n$. This is the same set that [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] calls $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The **Euclidean inner product** of $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the real number $$\\langle x, y\\rangle \\;:=\\; \\sum_{k<n} x_k\\,y_k ,$$ the finite sum of [[def-finite-sum]] applied to the list $k \\mapsto x_k y_k$ (extended by $0$ beyond $n$, as every finite list in this library is). The **Euclidean norm** of $x$ is $$\\lVert x\\rVert_2 \\;:=\\; \\sqrt{\\langle x, x\\rangle},$$ which is defined because $\\langle x,x\\rangle = \\sum_{k<n} x_k^{2} \\ge 0$ (a sum of nonnegative terms, [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 4 and [[lem-of-square-positive]], the case $x_k = 0$ giving $x_k^2 = 0$ by [[def-integer-power]]) and every nonnegative real has a unique nonnegative square root ([[thm-of-square-roots]]). ### Both are defined for every $n$, including $n = 0$ At $n = 0$ the set $\\mathbb{R}^{0}$ has exactly one element, the empty function, and it is the zero vector space ([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]] clause 5); the sum above is the empty sum, so $\\langle x,y\\rangle = 0$ and $\\lVert x\\rVert_2 = 0$. **This is the first place on this page where the two index regimes diverge, and the divergence is deliberate.** The published metrics $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_\\infty$ of [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] are defined only for $n \\ge 1$, because $d_\\infty$ would otherwise be a maximum over the empty index set; the algebra above needs no such restriction. The boundary in this page runs between the algebra and the metric, not where a reader would guess, and [[rem-rn-conventions-and-scope]] lists exactly which items inherit $n \\ge 1$. ### The algebra of the inner product For all $x, y, z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$: 1. **Symmetry.** $\\langle x,y\\rangle = \\langle y,x\\rangle$, since $x_ky_k = y_kx_k$ termwise. 2. **Additivity in the first argument.** $\\langle x + y, z\\rangle = \\langle x,z\\rangle + \\langle y,z\\rangle$: the list $k \\mapsto (x_k+y_k)z_k$ is the termwise sum of $k \\mapsto x_kz_k$ and $k \\mapsto y_kz_k$, so [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 1 applies. 3. **Homogeneity in the first argument.** $\\langle \\lambda x, y\\rangle = \\lambda\\langle x,y\\rangle$, by [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 2. 4. **Bilinearity.** Clauses 2 and 3 together with symmetry give the same two laws in the second argument. 5. **Positive definiteness.** $\\langle x,x\\rangle \\ge 0$, and $\\langle x,x\\rangle = 0$ if and only if $x = 0$. Indeed a vanishing sum of nonnegative terms has every term $0$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 4), so $x_k^{2} = 0$ for every $k < n$, and a nonzero real has a positive square ([[lem-of-square-positive]]), whence $x_k = 0$ for every $k < n$ and $x = 0$. 6. **Agreement with the published Euclidean metric.** For $n \\ge 1$ and $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, $\\lVert x - y\\rVert_2 = \\sqrt{\\sum_{k<n}(x_k-y_k)^{2}} = d_2(x,y)$, the two sides being the same expression ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]]). In particular $\\lVert x\\rVert_2 = d_2(x, 0)$. That $\\lVert\\cdot\\rVert_2$ is a norm in the sense of [[def-norm-and-normed-space]] is proved in [[thm-cauchy-schwarz-and-the-euclidean-norm]], where the triangle inequality is obtained from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality; it is not assumed here.",

Given $a^n \\ne 0$, the value $(a^n)^{-1}$ is a single well-determined element, because multiplicative inverses in a field are unique ([[lem-of-inverse-unique]]). **Integer exponents.** Every integer $m$ ([[def-integers]]) is either $\\iota(n)$ or $-\\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$, where $\\iota$ is the embedding $\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]], [[def-int-operations]]). This too is a citation and not a slogan: the order on $\\mathbb{Z}$ is total ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), so $m \\ge 0$ or $m < 0$; the image of $\\iota$ is exactly the set of nonnegative integers, and each of them is $\\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]); and if $m < 0$ then $-m > 0$, by compatibility of the order with addition ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), so $-m = \\iota(n)$ and $m = -\\iota(n)$, with $n$ unique because $\\iota$ is injective. The two clauses above therefore define $a^m$ for every $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ whenever $a \\ne 0$, and for every $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$ for arbitrary $a$. The clauses are consistent where they overlap: the only overlap is $m = 0$, where $-\\iota(0) = \\iota(0)$ and $(a^0)^{-1} = 1^{-1} = 1 = a^0$.",

      "quote": "Throughout this page $\\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) constructed in this library, in particular a field, so that \"vector space\" below always means vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-vector-space]]). Let $V$ be a vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$, with zero vector $0_V$. A **norm on $V$** is a function $N : V \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that for all $u, v \\in V$ and all $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$: - **(N1) Separation.** $N(v) = 0$ if and only if $v = 0_V$. - **(N2) Absolute homogeneity.** $N(\\lambda v) = |\\lambda|\\,N(v)$, the absolute value being that of [[def-abs-value]]. - **(N3) Triangle inequality.** $N(u + v) \\le N(u) + N(v)$. A **normed space** is a pair $(V, N)$ consisting of a vector space $V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ and a norm $N$ on it. When only one norm is in play we write $\\lVert v\\rVert$ for $N(v)$; when several are, the norm is always named. **The values of a norm are real numbers.** The codomain is $\\mathbb{R}$, so $N(v)$ is an honest element of the complete ordered field and no infinite value is permitted. This is the same convention [[rem-metric-axiom-conventions]] records for metrics. ### Nonnegativity is a theorem, not an axiom Many texts add a fourth condition $N(v) \\ge 0$. It is redundant. Applying (N2) with $\\lambda = -1$ gives $N(-v) = |-1|\\,N(v) = N(v)$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]] for $(-1)v = -v$), and then (N3) with $u = v$ and $-v$ gives $$0 \\;=\\; N(0_V) \\;=\\; N\\bigl(v + (-v)\\bigr) \\;\\le\\; N(v) + N(-v) \\;=\\; N(v) + N(v),$$ where $N(0_V) = 0$ is (N1). So $N(v) + N(v) \\ge 0$, and if $N(v) < 0$ then $N(v) + N(v) < 0$ by addition of inequalities, which trichotomy forbids ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]). Hence $N(v) \\ge 0$ for every $v \\in V$. **Consequently the verification of a candidate norm has three things to check and not four**, exactly as the verification of a candidate metric has three and not four ([[def-metric-space]], [[lem-metric-nonnegativity]]). No item in this library assumes nonnegativity of a norm before the argument above. ### The induced metric Let $N$ be a norm on $V$ and define $$d_N(u,v) \\;:=\\; N(u - v) \\qquad (u, v \\in V),$$ where $u - v = u + (-v)$ ([[def-vector-space]]). **Then $d_N$ is a metric on $V$** ([[def-metric-space]]), and the three axioms are the three conditions above, in order: - **(M1)** $d_N(u,v) = 0$ means $N(u-v) = 0$, which by (N1) says $u - v = 0_V$, that is $u = v$; and conversely $d_N(v,v) = N(0_V) = 0$. - **(M2)** $d_N(v,u) = N(v-u) = N\\bigl((-1)(u-v)\\bigr) = |-1|\\,N(u-v) = d_N(u,v)$, by (N2), [[lem-of-abs-value]] and $(-1)w = -w$ ([[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]]). - **(M3)** $d_N(u,w) = N\\bigl((u-v) + (v-w)\\bigr) \\le N(u-v) + N(v-w) = d_N(u,v) + d_N(v,w)$, by (N3). A normed space is therefore a metric space, and every notion defined for metric spaces — open set ([[def-metric-topology]]), convergence, Cauchyness, continuity, compactness — is available in it with no further definition. **This library never introduces a second notion of any of them for normed spaces.** ### Two properties an arbitrary metric need not have The metric $d_N$ satisfies, for all $u, v, w \\in V$ and $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$: - **translation invariance**, $d_N(u + w, v + w) = N\\bigl((u+w)-(v+w)\\bigr) = N(u-v) = d_N(u,v)$; - **absolute homogeneity**, $d_N(\\lambda u, \\lambda v) = N\\bigl(\\lambda(u-v)\\bigr) = |\\lambda|\\,d_N(u,v)$, by (N2). **Not every metric on a vector space arises from a norm**, and homogeneity is what fails. The published bounded remetrisation [[lem-bounded-remetrisation]] replaces a metric $d$ by $d' = \\min\\{d, 1\\}$, a metric with the same topology whose values never exceed $1$; on a vector space $V$ containing a vector $v$ with $d(v, 0_V) > 0$ this $d'$ cannot be $d_M$ for any norm $M$, since absolute homogeneity would force $d'(\\lambda v, 0_V) = |\\lambda|\\,d'(v, 0_V)$, which is unbounded in $\\lambda$, while $d'$ is bounded by $1$. So the passage from norms to metrics is not reversible, and a statement about a metric on a vector space is strictly weaker than the corresponding statement about a norm.",

The **Euclidean inner product** of $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the real number $$\\langle x, y\\rangle \\;:=\\; \\sum_{k<n} x_k\\,y_k ,$$ the finite sum of [[def-finite-sum]] applied to the list $k \\mapsto x_k y_k$ (extended by $0$ beyond $n$, as every finite list in this library is).

The boundary in this page runs between the algebra and the metric, not where a reader would guess, and [[rem-rn-conventions-and-scope]] lists exactly which items inherit $n \\ge 1$. ### The algebra of the inner product For all $x, y, z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$: 1. **Symmetry.** $\\langle x,y\\rangle = \\langle y,x\\rangle$, since $x_ky_k = y_kx_k$ termwise. 2. **Additivity in the first argument.** $\\langle x + y, z\\rangle = \\langle x,z\\rangle + \\langle y,z\\rangle$: the list $k \\mapsto (x_k+y_k)z_k$ is the termwise sum of $k \\mapsto x_kz_k$ and $k \\mapsto y_kz_k$, so [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 1 applies. 3. **Homogeneity in the first argument.** $\\langle \\lambda x, y\\rangle = \\lambda\\langle x,y\\rangle$, by [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 2. 4. **Bilinearity.** Clauses 2 and 3 together with symmetry give the same two laws in the second argument. 5. **Positive definiteness.** $\\langle x,x\\rangle \\ge 0$, and $\\langle x,x\\rangle = 0$ if and only if $x = 0$. Indeed a vanishing sum of nonnegative terms has every term $0$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 4), so $x_k^{2} = 0$ for every $k < n$, and a nonzero real has a positive square ([[lem-of-square-positive]]), whence $x_k = 0$ for every $k < n$ and $x = 0$. 6. **Agreement with the published Euclidean metric.** For $n \\ge 1$ and $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, $\\lVert x - y\\rVert_2 = \\sqrt{\\sum_{k<n}(x_k-y_k)^{2}} = d_2(x,y)$, the two sides being the same expression ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]]). In particular $\\lVert x\\rVert_2 = d_2(x, 0)$. That $\\lVert\\cdot\\rVert_2$ is a norm in the sense of [[def-norm-and-normed-space]] is proved in [[thm-cauchy-schwarz-and-the-euclidean-norm]], where the triangle inequality is obtained from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality; it is not assumed here.",

## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]). The **absolute value** of
$x \in F$ is

$$|x| \;:=\; \begin{cases} x & \text{if } x \ge 0, \\ -x & \text{if } x < 0. \end{cases}$$

## Remarks

- The distance between $x$ and $y$ is $|x - y|$.
- The basic algebraic properties ($|x| \ge 0$, $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$,
  $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$, and the characterisation $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$) are
  established in [[lem-of-abs-value]]; the triangle inequality is
  [[lem-of-triangle-inequality]].

## Definition

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. A natural number is a von Neumann natural, that is a set,
and $n = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]],
[[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]), so

$$\mathbb{R}^{n} \;=\; \{\, x \;:\; x \text{ is a function } n \to \mathbb{R} \,\}$$

is the function space of [[def-function-space]] at $F = \mathbb{R}$ and $X = n$,
a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ under the pointwise operations
([[def-vector-space]]). We write $x_k := x(k)$ for $k < n$, and two elements of
$\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are equal exactly when they agree at every $k < n$. This is the
same set that [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] calls $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.

The **Euclidean inner product** of $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the real number

$$\langle x, y\rangle \;:=\; \sum_{k<n} x_k\,y_k ,$$

the finite sum of [[def-finite-sum]] applied to the list $k \mapsto x_k y_k$
(extended by $0$ beyond $n$, as every finite list in this library is). The
**Euclidean norm** of $x$ is

$$\lVert x\rVert_2 \;:=\; \sqrt{\langle x, x\rangle},$$

which is defined because $\langle x,x\rangle = \sum_{k<n} x_k^{2} \ge 0$ (a sum
of nonnegative terms, [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 4 and
[[lem-of-square-positive]], the case $x_k = 0$ giving $x_k^2 = 0$ by
[[def-integer-power]]) and every nonnegative real has a unique nonnegative square
root ([[thm-of-square-roots]]).

### Both are defined for every $n$, including $n = 0$

At $n = 0$ the set $\mathbb{R}^{0}$ has exactly one element, the empty function,
and it is the zero vector space ([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]] clause 5); the sum
above is the empty sum, so $\langle x,y\rangle = 0$ and $\lVert x\rVert_2 = 0$.
**This is the first place on this page where the two index regimes diverge, and
the divergence is deliberate.** The published metrics $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_\infty$ of
[[lem-metrics-on-rn]] are defined only for $n \ge 1$, because $d_\infty$ would
otherwise be a maximum over the empty index set; the algebra above needs no such
restriction. The boundary in this page runs between the algebra and the metric,
not where a reader would guess, and [[rem-rn-conventions-and-scope]] lists
exactly which items inherit $n \ge 1$.

### The algebra of the inner product

For all $x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$:

1. **Symmetry.** $\langle x,y\rangle = \langle y,x\rangle$, since $x_ky_k = y_kx_k$
   termwise.
2. **Additivity in the first argument.**
   $\langle x + y, z\rangle = \langle x,z\rangle + \langle y,z\rangle$: the list
   $k \mapsto (x_k+y_k)z_k$ is the termwise sum of $k \mapsto x_kz_k$ and
   $k \mapsto y_kz_k$, so [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 1 applies.
3. **Homogeneity in the first argument.**
   $\langle \lambda x, y\rangle = \lambda\langle x,y\rangle$, by
   [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 2.
4. **Bilinearity.** Clauses 2 and 3 together with symmetry give the same two laws
   in the second argument.
5. **Positive definiteness.** $\langle x,x\rangle \ge 0$, and
   $\langle x,x\rangle = 0$ if and only if $x = 0$. Indeed a vanishing sum of
   nonnegative terms has every term $0$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 4), so
   $x_k^{2} = 0$ for every $k < n$, and a nonzero real has a positive square
   ([[lem-of-square-positive]]), whence $x_k = 0$ for every $k < n$ and $x = 0$.
6. **Agreement with the published Euclidean metric.** For $n \ge 1$ and
   $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$,
   $\lVert x - y\rVert_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}(x_k-y_k)^{2}} = d_2(x,y)$, the two
   sides being the same expression ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]]). In particular
   $\lVert x\rVert_2 = d_2(x, 0)$.

That $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ is a norm in the sense of [[def-norm-and-normed-space]]
is proved in [[thm-cauchy-schwarz-and-the-euclidean-norm]], where the triangle
inequality is obtained from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality; it is not assumed
here.

## Remarks

- **Scope: the concrete form only.** What is defined above is the Euclidean inner
  product on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and nothing more. The general theory of inner
  product spaces — abstract inner products, orthonormal bases, Gram-Schmidt,
  orthogonal projection and orthogonal complements of arbitrary subspaces — is
  planned for a page of this library that comes **earlier in the plan order** and
  is not yet built. No item on this page claims anything about abstract inner
  product spaces, and no item on this page introduces the general notion.

- **The standard basis and coordinates.** For $i < n$ the standard unit vector
  $e_i \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ has $e_i(i) = 1$ and $e_i(j) = 0$ for $j \ne i$
  ([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]]). Then $\langle x, e_i\rangle = x_i$: the list
  $k \mapsto x_k (e_i)_k$ vanishes except at $k = i$, where its value is $x_i$,
  and a list vanishing off one index sums to its value there
  ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 3, splitting the range at $i$). So the
  coordinates of $x$ are recovered by testing against the standard basis, which
  is the form used repeatedly below.

- **Powers here are integer powers.** $x_k^{2}$ means the integer power of
  [[def-integer-power]], and $\lVert x\rVert_2^{2} = \langle x,x\rangle$ by
  [[thm-of-square-roots]] and [[lem-power-laws]].

## Definition

Throughout this page $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), in particular an ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]]) and a field ([[def-field]]), and $\mathbb{N}$ is the set
of natural numbers ([[def-natural-numbers]]) with successor $\sigma(n) = n + 1$
([[def-nat-addition]]).

Let $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a sequence of reals, written $a_k$ for
$a(k)$. **Finite sums and finite products of $a$ are defined by recursion on the
upper index**, which is legitimate because of the recursion theorem
([[thm-recursion]]). That theorem produces a function of one variable, so the
running index has to be carried along inside the value: applying it to the set
$A = \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$, the starting element $(0, 0)$ and the function
$f(n, s) = (\sigma(n),\, s + a_n)$ gives a unique
$g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$ with

$$g(0) = (0, 0), \qquad g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n)) \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Write $g(n) = \big(\pi_1(g(n)),\, \Sigma_n\big)$ for its two coordinates.

**The first coordinate is the index itself, and that is a small induction, not an
observation** ([[thm-induction-principle]]). Indeed $\pi_1(g(0)) = 0$; and if
$\pi_1(g(n)) = n$, then
$g(\sigma(n)) = f\big(\pi_1(g(n)), \Sigma_n\big) = \big(\sigma(\pi_1(g(n))),\, \Sigma_n + a_{\pi_1(g(n))}\big) = \big(\sigma(n),\, \Sigma_n + a_n\big)$,
so $\pi_1(g(\sigma(n))) = \sigma(n)$. By induction $\pi_1(g(n)) = n$ for every
$n \in \mathbb{N}$. Only now may the second coordinate of the two displayed
clauses be read off, and doing so gives

$$\Sigma_0 = 0, \qquad \Sigma_{\sigma(n)} = \Sigma_n + a_n .$$

$\Sigma$ is moreover the **unique** function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with those
two properties: if $\Sigma'$ also has them then $n \mapsto (n, \Sigma'_n)$ satisfies
the two clauses defining $g$, hence equals $g$ by the uniqueness clause of
[[thm-recursion]], so $\Sigma' = \Sigma$.

We write $\sum_{k < n} a_k := \Sigma_n$. The same construction with starting
element $(0, 1)$ and $f(n, p) = (\sigma(n),\, p \cdot a_n)$, with the same
induction on the first coordinate and the same uniqueness argument, gives the
unique $\Pi : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with

$$\Pi_0 = 1, \qquad \Pi_{\sigma(n)} = \Pi_n \cdot a_n ,$$

and we write $\prod_{k < n} a_k := \Pi_n$.

**Notation.** For $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ we abbreviate

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \sum_{k < n+1} a_k, \qquad \prod_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \prod_{k < n+1} a_k,$$

and, for a general lower index $m$ with $m \le n + 1$, writing $d = n + 1 - m$
for the number of terms,

$$\sum_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \sum_{j < d} a_{m+j}, \qquad \prod_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \prod_{j < d} a_{m+j} .$$

When $m = n + 1$ we have $d = 0$ and the sum is **empty**, with value $0$, while
the empty product has value $1$. In the same spirit $\sum_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ is
notation for the empty sum $\Sigma_0 = 0$ and $\prod_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ for the
empty product $\Pi_0 = 1$; the index $-1$ never occurs as an element of
$\mathbb{N}$ and is only a way of writing "no terms".

Only finitely many values of $a$ enter $\sum_{k<n} a_k$, so the notation
$\sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\prod_{k<n} a_k$ is also used for a list
$a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$ of reals given without reference to any extension of the
list to all of $\mathbb{N}$: extend the list by $a_k = 0$ (respectively
$a_k = 1$) for $k \ge n$ and apply the definition above.

## Remarks

- **Why recursion and not "$a_0 + a_1 + \cdots + a_{n-1}$".** The dots are not a
  definition: they presuppose that the displayed pattern determines a value for
  every $n$, which is exactly what the recursion theorem
  ([[thm-recursion]]) supplies, and its uniqueness clause is what makes
  $\sum_{k<n} a_k$ a single well-determined real rather than a family of choices.
  Associativity and commutativity of addition are *not* used in the definition;
  they are used in the laws proved from it ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).
- **Naturals and rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$ (a convention used on the whole
  page).** A natural number $n$ and a rational number $r$ are not literally
  elements of $\mathbb{R}$: they enter $\mathbb{R}$ through the canonical
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$, which is an injective,
  order-preserving field homomorphism ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), restricting on
  positive naturals to $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} = 1_\mathbb{R} + \cdots + 1_\mathbb{R}$
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). Following ordinary practice, and only where no
  confusion is possible, we write $n$ for $\iota(n)$ and $r$ for $\iota(r)$; so,
  for instance, $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k<n} a_k$ means
  $\iota(n)^{-1} \cdot \sum_{k<n} a_k$, which makes sense because
  $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$. Exponents are the one place where the
  identification is deliberately NOT made: in $a^n$ and $a^r$ the exponent stays
  a natural, an integer or a rational ([[def-integer-power]],
  [[def-rational-power]]), never a real.
- The two indexings are related by $\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k = \sum_{k < n+1} a_k$, so
  a statement proved for one is available for the other. Sums over $k < n$ are
  the primitive form here because $\Sigma_0$, the empty sum, is then the base
  case of every induction, and no index outside $\mathbb{N}$ is ever needed.

## Definition

Let $a \in \mathbb{R}$, where $\mathbb{R}$ is the ambient ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]).

**Natural exponents.** By the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) applied to
the set $\mathbb{R}$, the starting element $1$ and the function
$f(x) = x \cdot a$, there is a unique function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$,
written $n \mapsto a^n$, with

$$a^0 = 1, \qquad a^{n+1} = a^n \cdot a \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Thus $a^1 = a$, $a^2 = a \cdot a$, and so on. Note that this is defined for
**every** $a$, including $a = 0$.

**Negative exponents.** If $a \ne 0$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, set

$$a^{-n} := (a^n)^{-1}.$$

**Why that is legitimate.** The right-hand side presupposes that $a^n$ is
invertible, that is, that $a^n \ne 0$. This is a proof obligation and not an
observation, and it is discharged by claim 2 of [[lem-power-laws]]: for $a \ne 0$
in a field, $a^n \ne 0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, proved there by induction on
$n$ from the fact that a field has no zero divisors ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]).
That lemma is a statement *about* the operation introduced here, so it depends on
this definition and is recorded in this item's `justified_by` rather than in its
`deps` (SCHEMA §3). Given $a^n \ne 0$, the value $(a^n)^{-1}$ is a single
well-determined element, because multiplicative inverses in a field are unique
([[lem-of-inverse-unique]]).

**Integer exponents.** Every integer $m$ ([[def-integers]]) is either
$\iota(n)$ or $-\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$, where $\iota$ is the
embedding $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]],
[[def-int-operations]]). This too is a citation and not a slogan: the order on
$\mathbb{Z}$ is total ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), so $m \ge 0$ or $m < 0$; the
image of $\iota$ is exactly the set of nonnegative integers, and each of them is
$\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]); and if $m < 0$ then
$-m > 0$, by compatibility of the order with addition ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]),
so $-m = \iota(n)$ and $m = -\iota(n)$, with $n$ unique because $\iota$ is
injective. The two clauses above therefore define $a^m$ for every
$m \in \mathbb{Z}$ whenever $a \ne 0$, and for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$ for
arbitrary $a$. The clauses are consistent where they overlap: the only overlap is
$m = 0$, where $-\iota(0) = \iota(0)$ and $(a^0)^{-1} = 1^{-1} = 1 = a^0$.

## Remarks

- **The convention $0^0 = 1$ is adopted here**, and it is not a matter of taste
  but of agreement with the recursion above: $a^0 = 1$ is the starting value for
  every $a$, exactly as the empty product is $1$ ([[def-finite-sum]]). This is
  the convention that makes the empty product, the binomial theorem, and
  polynomial notation $\sum_k c_k x^k$ work at $x = 0$ without an exception. The
  competing convention "$0^0$ undefined" belongs to contexts where $x^y$ is
  studied as a function of two *real* variables and one wants continuity, which
  is unavailable and irrelevant here: the exponent in $a^m$ is an integer, never
  a real.
- $0^n = 0$ for every $n \ge 1$, since $0^{n} = 0^{n-1} \cdot 0 = 0$, a product
  with a zero factor ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]); and
  $0^{-n}$ is not defined for $n \ge 1$, since $0$ has no inverse.
- The exponent is an integer and stays an integer. Rational exponents are a
  separate construction resting on the existence of roots
  ([[thm-nth-roots-exist]], [[def-rational-power]]), and real exponents do not
  exist in this library yet ([[rem-real-exponents-deferred]]).
- The laws $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$ are
  proved, not assumed, in [[lem-power-laws]]; the order behaviour of $a \mapsto a^n$
  is [[lem-power-monotone]].

## Definition

Throughout this page $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) constructed in this library, in particular a
field, so that "vector space" below always means vector space over $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-vector-space]]).

Let $V$ be a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$, with zero vector $0_V$. A **norm on
$V$** is a function $N : V \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $u, v \in V$ and all
$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$:

- **(N1) Separation.** $N(v) = 0$ if and only if $v = 0_V$.
- **(N2) Absolute homogeneity.** $N(\lambda v) = |\lambda|\,N(v)$, the absolute
  value being that of [[def-abs-value]].
- **(N3) Triangle inequality.** $N(u + v) \le N(u) + N(v)$.

A **normed space** is a pair $(V, N)$ consisting of a vector space $V$ over
$\mathbb{R}$ and a norm $N$ on it. When only one norm is in play we write
$\lVert v\rVert$ for $N(v)$; when several are, the norm is always named.

**The values of a norm are real numbers.** The codomain is $\mathbb{R}$, so
$N(v)$ is an honest element of the complete ordered field and no infinite value
is permitted. This is the same convention [[rem-metric-axiom-conventions]]
records for metrics.

### Nonnegativity is a theorem, not an axiom

Many texts add a fourth condition $N(v) \ge 0$. It is redundant. Applying (N2)
with $\lambda = -1$ gives $N(-v) = |-1|\,N(v) = N(v)$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]],
[[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]] for $(-1)v = -v$), and then (N3)
with $u = v$ and $-v$ gives

$$0 \;=\; N(0_V) \;=\; N\bigl(v + (-v)\bigr) \;\le\; N(v) + N(-v) \;=\; N(v) + N(v),$$

where $N(0_V) = 0$ is (N1). So $N(v) + N(v) \ge 0$, and if $N(v) < 0$ then
$N(v) + N(v) < 0$ by addition of inequalities, which trichotomy forbids
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]). Hence $N(v) \ge 0$ for every $v \in V$.

**Consequently the verification of a candidate norm has three things to check and
not four**, exactly as the verification of a candidate metric has three and not
four ([[def-metric-space]], [[lem-metric-nonnegativity]]). No item in this
library assumes nonnegativity of a norm before the argument above.

### The induced metric

Let $N$ be a norm on $V$ and define

$$d_N(u,v) \;:=\; N(u - v) \qquad (u, v \in V),$$

where $u - v = u + (-v)$ ([[def-vector-space]]). **Then $d_N$ is a metric on
$V$** ([[def-metric-space]]), and the three axioms are the three conditions
above, in order:

- **(M1)** $d_N(u,v) = 0$ means $N(u-v) = 0$, which by (N1) says $u - v = 0_V$,
  that is $u = v$; and conversely $d_N(v,v) = N(0_V) = 0$.
- **(M2)** $d_N(v,u) = N(v-u) = N\bigl((-1)(u-v)\bigr) = |-1|\,N(u-v) = d_N(u,v)$,
  by (N2), [[lem-of-abs-value]] and $(-1)w = -w$
  ([[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]]).
- **(M3)** $d_N(u,w) = N\bigl((u-v) + (v-w)\bigr) \le N(u-v) + N(v-w) = d_N(u,v) + d_N(v,w)$,
  by (N3).

A normed space is therefore a metric space, and every notion defined for metric
spaces — open set ([[def-metric-topology]]), convergence, Cauchyness,
continuity, compactness — is available in it with no further definition. **This
library never introduces a second notion of any of them for normed spaces.**

### Two properties an arbitrary metric need not have

The metric $d_N$ satisfies, for all $u, v, w \in V$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$:

- **translation invariance**, $d_N(u + w, v + w) = N\bigl((u+w)-(v+w)\bigr) = N(u-v) = d_N(u,v)$;
- **absolute homogeneity**, $d_N(\lambda u, \lambda v) = N\bigl(\lambda(u-v)\bigr) = |\lambda|\,d_N(u,v)$, by (N2).

**Not every metric on a vector space arises from a norm**, and homogeneity is
what fails. The published bounded remetrisation [[lem-bounded-remetrisation]]
replaces a metric $d$ by $d' = \min\{d, 1\}$, a metric with the same topology
whose values never exceed $1$; on a vector space $V$ containing a vector $v$ with
$d(v, 0_V) > 0$ this $d'$ cannot be $d_M$ for any norm $M$, since absolute
homogeneity would force $d'(\lambda v, 0_V) = |\lambda|\,d'(v, 0_V)$, which is
unbounded in $\lambda$, while $d'$ is bounded by $1$. So the passage from norms
to metrics is not reversible, and a statement about a metric on a vector space is
strictly weaker than the corresponding statement about a norm.

## Remarks

- **Why (N1) is stated as an equivalence.** The direction $N(0_V) = 0$ is forced
  by (N2) with $\lambda = 0$, since $0\,v = 0_V$
  ([[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]]) gives $N(0_V) = |0|\,N(v) = 0$.
  Only the direction "$N(v) = 0$ implies $v = 0_V$" is a genuine assumption, and
  dropping it gives what is usually called a seminorm, a notion this library does
  not use. The situation is exactly the one [[rem-metric-axiom-conventions]]
  describes for (M1) and the pseudometric.

- **The zero space carries exactly one norm.** If $V = \{0_V\}$ then the only
  function $V \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying (N1) is the one with value $0$, and it
  satisfies (N2) and (N3) trivially. In particular $\mathbb{R}^{0}$, the function
  space on the empty index set ([[def-function-space]]), is a normed space,
  although the metrics of the published metric theory on $\mathbb{R}^n$ are
  defined only for $n \ge 1$.

- **What is not defined here.** This item does not define linear maps; their
  published definition is [[def-linear-map]]. It also does not define operator
  norms, dual spaces, or abstract inner product spaces.
  [[rem-rn-conventions-and-scope]] records the remaining scope boundaries and
  what each later development would license.

## Statement

Let $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be sequences of reals, let
$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, and let $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, with finite sums and
finite products as in [[def-finite-sum]]. Then:

1. **Additivity.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k$.
2. **Scaling.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k$; in particular $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda = n\lambda$, where $n$ denotes the canonical natural $\iota(n) \in \mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).
3. **Splitting.** If $m \le n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k$, and $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n} a_k = \Big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k\Big)$.
4. **Monotonicity.** If $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$. In particular, if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, every single term satisfies $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$ for $j < n$, and $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ forces $a_k = 0$ for every $k < n$.
5. **Telescoping.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}\big(c_{k+1} - c_k\big) = c_n - c_0$.
6. **Products.** $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k) = \Big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\Big)$; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, and if $a_k > 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k > 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\lambda$, and naturals $m, n$. Write $\Sigma_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\Pi_n = \prod_{k<n} a_k$.

[L1] Recursion clauses ([[def-finite-sum]]): $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ and $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n$; $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1$ and $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) \cdot a_n$; and $\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k = \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j}$ for $m \le n$, likewise for products.

[L2] Field axioms: addition and multiplication are associative and commutative, $0$ and $1$ are the identities, $x - x = 0$, and multiplication distributes over addition ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]); and $0 \cdot x = 0$, which is not an axiom but a lemma ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

[L3] Induction principle: a property holding at $0$ and inherited by successors holds at every natural ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L4] Adding inequalities: $x \le y$ and $u \le v$ imply $x + u \le y + v$. [[lem-of-add-order]] states the STRICT forms and only those ($x < y \Rightarrow x + c < y + c$, and $x < y$ with $u < v$ giving $x + u < y + v$); the nonstrict form used throughout below is those two together with the cases $x = y$ and $u = v$, which are settled by trichotomy, the order being total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] The canonical embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a field homomorphism, so $\iota(0) = 0$ and $\iota(n+1) = \iota(n) + 1$, and $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L6] Sign rules: a product of two positives is positive ([[lem-of-sign-rules]], claim 1), and a product of two nonnegatives is nonnegative, since a factor equal to $0$ makes the product $0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]) and otherwise both factors are positive; and $1 > 0$, which is proved in [[cor-of-one-positive]] and stated by none of the items named above.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 0$: every claim holds at $n = 0$, since both sides of claim 1 are $0 = 0 + 0$, both sides of claim 2 are $0 = \lambda \cdot 0$ and $0 = \iota(0)\lambda$, claim 4 reads $0 \le 0$ with no term to bound and the hypothesis $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ giving nothing to prove, claim 5 reads $0 = c_0 - c_0$, and claim 6 reads $1 = 1 \cdot 1$ with $1 > 0$. [base, L1, L2, L5, L6]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for this $n$ and for all sequences $a, b, c$ and all $\lambda$. [ih]

1.3 Splitting, claim 3, by a separate induction on the number of trailing terms $d = n - m$ with $m$ fixed: for $d = 0$ the claim reads $\sum_{k<m} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + 0$ and $\prod_{k<m} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\big) \cdot 1$, which hold; and if $\sum_{k<m+d} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d} a_{m+j}$, then $\sum_{k<m+d+1} a_k = \sum_{k<m+d} a_k + a_{m+d} = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \big(\sum_{j<d} a_{m+j} + a_{m+d}\big) = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d+1} a_{m+j}$ by associativity, and identically for products with $1$ in place of $0$ and multiplication in place of addition, so induction on $d$ gives claim 3 for every $m \le n$. [L1, L2, L3]

2.1 Additivity at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k\big) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) + \big(\sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n\big) = \sum_{k<n+1} a_k + \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$, using the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of addition. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Scaling at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda a_k = \sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda\big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) = \lambda \sum_{k<n+1} a_k$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and distributivity; taking $a_k = 1$ for all $k$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda = \sum_{k<n} \lambda + \lambda = \iota(n)\lambda + \lambda = (\iota(n) + 1)\lambda = \iota(n+1)\lambda$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L5]

2.3 Monotonicity at $n+1$: assume $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n+1$; then $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$, so the hypothesis gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$, and adding the inequality $a_n \le b_n$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n \le \sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n = \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$. [step 1.2, L1, L4]

2.4 Telescoping at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(c_{k+1} - c_k) = \sum_{k<n}(c_{k+1} - c_k) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = (c_n - c_0) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = c_{n+1} - c_0$, by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and the field identities. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.5 Products at $n+1$: $\prod_{k<n+1}(a_k b_k) = \big(\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k)\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n+1} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n+1} b_k\big)$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of multiplication; and if every $a_k \ge 0$ for $k < n+1$ then $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) a_n$ is a product of two nonnegatives, hence nonnegative, with the same argument giving positivity from positivity since $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1 > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L6]

3.1 Consequences of monotonicity, completing claim 4: monotonicity itself holds at every $n$, by the induction principle applied to the base case of step 1.1 and the successor step 2.3, so it is available for an arbitrary $n$ in what follows; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then comparing with the zero sequence gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge \sum_{k<n} 0 = 0$; for $j < n$ splitting at $j$ and then at $j+1$ writes $\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<j} a_k + a_j + \sum_{k=j+1}^{n-1} a_k$ with the first and third summands $\ge 0$, so $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$; and if moreover $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ then $0 \le a_j \le 0$ for every $j < n$, so $a_j = 0$. [step 1.1, step 2.3, step 1.3, L3, L4, L2]

4.1 By the induction principle claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and claim 3 was proved in step 1.3 with its consequences in step 3.1, so all six laws hold. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, step 2.5, step 1.3, step 3.1, L3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$. A von Neumann natural is the set of its
predecessors, $n = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]), so it can be
used directly as an index set. Define

$$\mathbb{R}^n := \{\, x : x \text{ is a function } n \to \mathbb{R} \,\},$$

and write $x_k$ for $x(k)$, $k < n$. Two elements of $\mathbb{R}^n$ are equal
exactly when they agree at every $k < n$, functions being equal when they have
the same values. For $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ put

$$d_1(x,y) := \sum_{k<n} |x_k - y_k|, \qquad d_2(x,y) := \sqrt{\ \sum_{k<n} (x_k - y_k)^2\ }, \qquad d_\infty(x,y) := \max\{\, |x_k - y_k| : k < n \,\}.$$

All three are well defined: the finite sums are those of [[def-finite-sum]]; the
sum of squares is nonnegative ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[lem-of-square-positive]])
so it has a unique nonnegative square root ([[thm-of-square-roots]]); and
$\{|x_k - y_k| : k < n\}$ is a nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$, because
$n \ge 1$, so it has a maximum ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

**Then $d_1$, $d_2$ and $d_\infty$ are metrics on $\mathbb{R}^n$**
([[def-metric-space]]).

**Why $n \ge 1$.** For $n = 0$ the set $\mathbb{R}^0$ has exactly one element,
the empty function, and $d_1$ and $d_2$ are the empty sum $0$ and its root; but
$d_\infty$ would be the maximum of the empty set, which does not exist. The
hypothesis $n \ge 1$ is therefore not decoration, and it is carried by every
statement about $d_\infty$ in this library.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural $n \ge 1$; elements $x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}^n$; and the lists $a_k := x_k - y_k$, $b_k := y_k - z_k$ for $k < n$, so that $a_k + b_k = x_k - z_k$. Write $A := \sum_{k<n} a_k^2$, $C := \sum_{k<n} b_k^2$ and $B := \sum_{k<n} a_k b_k$.

[L1] Laws of finite sums ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[def-finite-sum]]): additivity, scaling, monotonicity; a sum of nonnegative terms is nonnegative, every single term is at most the sum, and a sum of nonnegative terms that vanishes has every term $0$.

[L2] Absolute value ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]]): $|u| \ge 0$; $|u| = 0$ if and only if $u = 0$; $|-u| = |u|$; and $u \le |u|$.

[L3] Two-term triangle inequality: $|u + v| \le |u| + |v|$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L4] Minkowski's inequality at the rational exponent $p = 1$ ([[thm-minkowski-finite]]): $\sum_{k<n}|a_k + b_k| \le \sum_{k<n}|a_k| + \sum_{k<n}|b_k|$.

[L5] Cauchy-Schwarz in root form ([[thm-cauchy-schwarz-finite]]): $\big|\sum_{k<n} a_k b_k\big| \le \sqrt{\sum_{k<n} a_k^2}\ \sqrt{\sum_{k<n} b_k^2}$.

[L6] Square roots ([[thm-of-square-roots]]): every $c \ge 0$ has a unique $\sqrt{c} \ge 0$ with $(\sqrt{c})^2 = c$; in particular $\sqrt{c} = 0$ if and only if $c = 0$.

[L7] Squares ([[lem-of-square-positive]], [[def-integer-power]]): $u^2 \ge 0$ always, and $u^2 = 0$ only for $u = 0$; and monotonicity of squaring on the nonnegatives, $s \le t \iff s^2 \le t^2$ for $s, t \ge 0$ ([[lem-of-square-monotone]]).

[L8] Maximum of a nonempty finite set of reals: it exists, it belongs to the set, and it is an upper bound of the set ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L9] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: inequalities may be added and a constant added to both sides, in the strict form of [[lem-of-add-order]] and, together with the case of equality settled by totality ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]), in the nonstrict form used below.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Separation for $d_1$: $d_1(x,y) = \sum_{k<n}|a_k|$ is a sum of nonnegative terms, so it vanishes exactly when every $|a_k|$ vanishes, that is exactly when $x_k = y_k$ for all $k < n$, that is exactly when $x = y$. [L1, L2]

1.2 Separation for $d_2$: $d_2(x,y) = \sqrt{A}$ vanishes exactly when $A = 0$; $A$ is a sum of nonnegative terms, so $A = 0$ exactly when $a_k^2 = 0$ for every $k < n$, which happens exactly when every $a_k = 0$, that is exactly when $x = y$. [L1, L6, L7]

1.3 Separation for $d_\infty$: the maximum $d_\infty(x,y)$ belongs to $\{|a_k| : k < n\}$ and bounds it above, so it is $0$ exactly when every $|a_k| = 0$, that is exactly when $x = y$. [L2, L8]

1.4 Symmetry for all three: $|y_k - x_k| = |-(x_k - y_k)| = |x_k - y_k|$ and $(y_k - x_k)^2 = (x_k - y_k)^2$ for every $k < n$, so the three defining expressions are unchanged when $x$ and $y$ are exchanged. [L2, L7]

1.5 Triangle inequality for $d_1$: applying [L4] to the lists $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ gives $d_1(x,z) = \sum_{k<n}|a_k + b_k| \le \sum_{k<n}|a_k| + \sum_{k<n}|b_k| = d_1(x,y) + d_1(y,z)$. [L4]

1.6 Expanding with additivity and scaling: $\sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k)^2 = \sum_{k<n}\big(a_k^2 + 2a_kb_k + b_k^2\big) = A + 2B + C$. [L1, algebra]

1.7 By [L5] and $B \le |B|$: $B \le \sqrt{A}\,\sqrt{C}$, and $A = (\sqrt{A})^2$, $C = (\sqrt{C})^2$ with $\sqrt{A}, \sqrt{C} \ge 0$. [L2, L5, L6]

1.8 Triangle inequality for $d_\infty$: for each $k < n$, $|a_k + b_k| \le |a_k| + |b_k| \le d_\infty(x,y) + d_\infty(y,z)$ because the two maxima bound their sets; so $d_\infty(x,y) + d_\infty(y,z)$ is an upper bound of $\{|a_k + b_k| : k < n\}$, and the maximum $d_\infty(x,z)$ of that set is one of its elements, whence $d_\infty(x,z) \le d_\infty(x,y) + d_\infty(y,z)$. [L3, L8, L9]

2.1 Combining steps 1.6 and 1.7: $\sum_{k<n}(a_k+b_k)^2 = A + 2B + C \le (\sqrt{A})^2 + 2\sqrt{A}\sqrt{C} + (\sqrt{C})^2 = \big(\sqrt{A} + \sqrt{C}\big)^2$. [step 1.6, step 1.7, L9, algebra]

3.1 Both $d_2(x,z) = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}(a_k+b_k)^2}$ and $\sqrt{A} + \sqrt{C}$ are nonnegative, and by step 2.1 the square of the first is at most the square of the second, so monotonicity of squaring on the nonnegatives gives $d_2(x,z) \le \sqrt{A} + \sqrt{C} = d_2(x,y) + d_2(y,z)$. [step 2.1, L6, L7]

4.1 Each of $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_\infty$ satisfies (M1) by steps 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3, satisfies (M2) by step 1.4, and satisfies (M3) by steps 1.5, 3.1 and 1.8 respectively; hence all three are metrics on $\mathbb{R}^n$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.8, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **$\mathbb{R}^n$ is defined ZFC-natively here**, as the set of functions from
  the von Neumann natural $n$ to $\mathbb{R}$, precisely so that its coordinates
  are indexed by $k < n$ and the finite-sum machinery of [[def-finite-sum]],
  [[thm-minkowski-finite]] and [[thm-cauchy-schwarz-finite]], all of which sum
  over $k < n$, applies without any reindexing.
- **No rational power appears anywhere above.** The triangle inequality for
  $d_2$ is obtained from Cauchy-Schwarz and the existence of square roots, not
  from Minkowski at $p = 2$, so this lemma does not depend on the theory of
  rational exponents. Minkowski is used only at $p = 1$, where its statement is
  the termwise sum of the two-term triangle inequality.
- **The three metrics are Lipschitz equivalent, with explicit constants,** and
  in particular have the same topology; that computation is on the companion
  page and is not needed here.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$, with
$|x|$ the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]). Then

$$|x| \ge 0; \quad |x| = 0 \iff x = 0; \quad -|x| \le x \le |x|; \quad |-x| = |x|; \quad |xy| = |x|\,|y|;$$

and, for every $c > 0$, one has $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and elements $x, y \in F$.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| = u$ if $u \ge 0$, and $|u| = -u$ if $u < 0$ ([[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Ordered-field order: trichotomy holds (for each $u$ exactly one of $u > 0$, $u = 0$, $u < 0$), $a < b$ means $b - a$ is positive, and sums and products of positives are positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Signs in products: $(-a)b = -(ab)$ and $(-a)(-b) = ab$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] Sign rules: a product of two elements of the same sign is positive, and a product of two elements of opposite sign is negative ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Case $x > 0$: by [L1] $|x| = x > 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; since $-x < 0$ we get $|-x| = -(-x) = x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -x < 0 < x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case pos, L1, L2, algebra]

1.2 Case $x = 0$: then $|x| = |0| = 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ holds with $|x| = 0$ and $x = 0$, while $|-x| = |0| = |x|$ and $-|x| = 0 \le 0 \le 0 = |x|$. [assume-case zero, L1]

1.3 Case $x < 0$: by [L1] $|x| = -x$, and [L2] gives $-x > 0$, so $|x| > 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; here $|-x| = -x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -(-x) = x \le x$ while $x < 0 < -x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case neg, L1, L2, algebra]

1.4 Case $x = 0$ or $y = 0$: then $xy = 0$, so $|xy| = 0$, and one of $|x|, |y|$ is $0$, whence $|x|\,|y| = 0 = |xy|$. [assume-case zerofactor, L1]

1.5 Case $x, y$ have the same sign (both positive or both negative): by [L4] $xy > 0$, so $|xy| = xy$, while $|x|\,|y| = xy$ by [L3] (for $x, y < 0$ this is $(-x)(-y) = xy$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case same, L1, L3, L4]

1.6 Case $x, y$ have opposite signs (one positive, one negative): by [L4] $xy < 0$, so $|xy| = -(xy)$, while $|x|\,|y| = -(xy)$ by [L3] (namely $x(-y)$ or $(-x)y$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case opposite, L1, L3, L4]

2.1 By trichotomy [L2] each $x$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.1-1.3, and in each we verified $|x| \ge 0$, that $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$, that $|-x| = |x|$, and that $-|x| \le x \le |x|$; hence all four hold for every $x$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, cases-exhaustive]

2.2 By trichotomy [L2] each pair $x, y$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.4-1.6, and in each $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$ for all $x, y$. [step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6, cases-exhaustive]

3.1 Let $c > 0$: if $|x| < c$ then $-c < -|x| \le x \le |x| < c$ by [step 2.1] and [L2], so $-c < x < c$; conversely if $-c < x < c$ then both $x < c$ and $-x < c$, and since $|x|$ equals $x$ or $-x$ by [L1], we get $|x| < c$, so $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$. [step 2.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field. For $a, b \ge 0$:

$$a < b \iff a^2 < b^2, \qquad a \le b \iff a^2 \le b^2.$$

More generally, for arbitrary $a, b \in F$, $a^2 < b^2 \iff |a| < |b|$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Elements $a, b$ of an ordered field $F$.

[L1] For a positive factor $s > 0$ and any $t$: $t > 0 \iff st > 0$; this is [[lem-of-sign-rules]] (the rule $c > 0 \Rightarrow (x < y \iff xc < yc)$ taken at $x = 0$, $y = t$, $c = s$, using $0 \cdot s = 0$, [[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

[L2] Trichotomy: for $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $a > b$ holds; and a sum of two nonnegatives with at least one positive is positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] $|x| \ge 0$ and $|x|^2 = x^2$ for every $x$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The difference factors as $b^2 - a^2 = (b - a)(b + a)$. [algebra]

2.1 If $a, b \ge 0$ and $a < b$, then $b > 0$, so $b + a > 0$ by [L2], and $b - a > 0$; by [L1] with $s = b + a$ and $t = b - a$, $(b - a)(b + a) > 0$, i.e. $a^2 < b^2$. [L1, L2, step 1.1]

2.2 If $a, b \ge 0$ and $a^2 < b^2$, then $b^2 - a^2 > 0$, so $a, b$ are not both zero and $b + a > 0$ by [L2]; by [L1] with $s = b + a$, from $(b - a)(b + a) = b^2 - a^2 > 0$ we get $b - a > 0$, i.e. $a < b$. [L1, L2, step 1.1]

3.1 Hence for $a, b \ge 0$, $a < b \iff a^2 < b^2$. [step 2.1, step 2.2]

4.1 The $\le$ form follows by trichotomy: for $a, b \ge 0$, applying step 3.1 to the nonnegatives $b, a$ gives $a \le b \iff \lnot(b < a) \iff \lnot(b^2 < a^2) \iff a^2 \le b^2$. [step 3.1, L2]

5.1 For arbitrary $a, b$, [L3] gives $|a|, |b| \ge 0$ with $|a|^2 = a^2$ and $|b|^2 = b^2$; applying step 3.1 to $|a|, |b|$ yields $a^2 < b^2 \iff |a|^2 < |b|^2 \iff |a| < |b|$. [step 3.1, L3] ∎

## Statement

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $p \in \mathbb{Q}$ with $p \ge 1$, with the norms
of [[def-p-norms-on-rn]]. Then:

1. $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$ is a norm on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
   ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]).
2. For $n \ge 1$, $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ is a norm on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
3. **The dictionary.** For $n \ge 1$ and all $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$,
   $$\lVert x-y\rVert_1 = d_1(x,y), \qquad \lVert x-y\rVert_2 = d_2(x,y), \qquad \lVert x-y\rVert_\infty = d_\infty(x,y),$$
   where $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_\infty$ are the metrics of the published
   [[lem-metrics-on-rn]]. So the metric induced by each of these three norms
   ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]) **is** the correspondingly named published
   metric, not merely one equivalent to it.

**Consequence, used repeatedly below and stated once here.** By clause 3 at
$p = 2$, the metric space $(\mathbb{R}^{n}, d_2)$ of the published metric-spaces
page and the metric space underlying the normed space
$(\mathbb{R}^{n}, \lVert\cdot\rVert_2)$ of this page are the same object. Hence
completeness ([[thm-euclidean-space-complete]] clause 2), Heine-Borel
([[thm-heine-borel-rn]] clause 2) and the compactness equivalences
([[thm-metric-compactness-equivalences]]) are statements about this page's normed
space, **with their hypothesis $n \ge 1$ inherited unchanged and not weakened**.
Nothing below cites any of those three theorems for $n = 0$.

**Why this lemma exists.** Without it the library would hold a norm-induced
metric on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and a separately published metric on the same set with
no recorded relation, and every later citation would have to guess which was
meant. The proof of clause 3 is a comparison of two written expressions; the
value is that the comparison is made and recorded.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural number $n$, a rational $p \ge 1$, vectors $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ and a real $\lambda$; write $S(x) := \sum_{k<n}|x_k|^{p}$, so that $\lVert x\rVert_p = S(x)^{1/p}$ ([[def-p-norms-on-rn]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[A1] For clauses 2 and 3, $n \ge 1$, so that $\{|x_k| : k<n\}$ is a nonempty finite set of reals ([[def-p-norms-on-rn]], [[lem-metrics-on-rn]]).

[L1] Rational powers ([[def-rational-power]], [[lem-rational-power-laws]]): for $a, b \ge 0$ and rationals $r, s > 0$ one has $a^{r} \ge 0$, $(ab)^{r} = a^{r}b^{r}$, $0^{r} = 0$, and $a^{r} > 0$ when $a > 0$; and for $a > 0$, $(a^{r})^{s} = a^{rs}$ and $a^{1} = a$.

[L2] Monotonicity in the base ([[lem-rational-power-monotone]] clause 2): for a rational $r > 0$ and reals $0 \le a < b$ one has $a^{r} < b^{r}$; hence $a \le b$ implies $a^{r} \le b^{r}$, the case $a = b$ being trivial, and $a^{r} = 0$ only for $a = 0$.

[L3] Laws of finite sums ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[def-finite-sum]]): additivity, scaling, monotonicity; a sum of nonnegative terms is nonnegative, each single term is at most such a sum, and a sum of nonnegative terms that vanishes has every term $0$.

[L4] Minkowski's inequality for finite sums at rational $p \ge 1$ ([[thm-minkowski-finite]]): $\bigl(\sum_{k<n}|a_k+b_k|^{p}\bigr)^{1/p} \le \bigl(\sum_{k<n}|a_k|^{p}\bigr)^{1/p} + \bigl(\sum_{k<n}|b_k|^{p}\bigr)^{1/p}$.

[L5] Absolute value ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]], [[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]): $|t| \ge 0$; $|t| = 0$ exactly when $t = 0$; $|st| = |s|\,|t|$; $|s+t| \le |s|+|t|$; and $|t|^{2} = t^{2}$.

[L6] Maxima ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]): a nonempty finite set of reals has a maximum, the maximum belongs to the set and bounds it above, and a set with an upper bound belonging to it has that element as its maximum.

[L7] Order arithmetic: multiplying an inequality by a nonnegative real preserves it ([[lem-of-sign-rules]] in its strict form, together with the case of equality settled by totality), and $\le$ is transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L8] The norm axioms (N1), (N2), (N3) ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]); $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ agrees with the Euclidean norm of [[def-euclidean-inner-product]], and is a norm by [[thm-cauchy-schwarz-and-the-euclidean-norm]]; square roots are the rational power at exponent $1/2$ ([[thm-of-square-roots]], [[def-p-norms-on-rn]]).

[L9] The published metrics on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n \ge 1$ are $d_1(x,y) = \sum_{k<n}|x_k-y_k|$, $d_2(x,y) = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}(x_k-y_k)^{2}}$ and $d_\infty(x,y) = \max\{|x_k-y_k| : k<n\}$, and each is a metric ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]], [[def-metric-space]], [[def-metric-topology]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Every term $|x_k|^{p}$ is nonnegative, so $S(x) \ge 0$ and $\lVert x\rVert_p = S(x)^{1/p}$ is defined and nonnegative. [L1, L3]

1.2 $S(x) = 0$ holds exactly when $|x_k|^{p} = 0$ for every $k<n$, a vanishing sum of nonnegative terms having every term $0$; and $|x_k|^{p} = 0$ exactly when $|x_k| = 0$, that is exactly when $x_k = 0$. [L1, L2, L3, L5]

1.3 For every $k<n$, $|(\lambda x)_k|^{p} = \bigl(|\lambda|\,|x_k|\bigr)^{p} = |\lambda|^{p}|x_k|^{p}$, so $S(\lambda x) = |\lambda|^{p}S(x)$ by scaling of finite sums. [L1, L3, L5]

1.4 Instantiating [L4] at $a_k := x_k$ and $b_k := y_k$, and using $(x+y)_k = x_k+y_k$, gives $\lVert x+y\rVert_p \le \lVert x\rVert_p + \lVert y\rVert_p$, which is axiom (N3) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$. [L4, L8]

1.5 Under [A1] the set $\{|x_k| : k<n\}$ is nonempty and finite, so $\lVert x\rVert_\infty$ exists, is one of the $|x_k|$, and satisfies $|x_k| \le \lVert x\rVert_\infty$ for every $k<n$; in particular $\lVert x\rVert_\infty \ge 0$. [A1, L5, L6]

1.6 Under [A1], $\lVert x-y\rVert_1 = \sum_{k<n}|x_k-y_k|$ by the case $p=1$ of the definition, and that is the written expression for $d_1(x,y)$. [L1, L9]

1.7 Under [A1], $\lVert x-y\rVert_2 = \bigl(\sum_{k<n}|x_k-y_k|^{2}\bigr)^{1/2} = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}(x_k-y_k)^{2}}$, using $|t|^{2} = t^{2}$ and the identification of the exponent $1/2$ with the nonnegative square root, and that is the written expression for $d_2(x,y)$. [L5, L8, L9]

1.8 Under [A1], $\lVert x-y\rVert_\infty = \max\{|x_k-y_k| : k<n\}$ by definition, and that is the written expression for $d_\infty(x,y)$. [L9]

2.1 $\lVert x\rVert_p = 0$ holds exactly when $S(x) = 0$, since $S(x) > 0$ would give $S(x)^{1/p} > 0$ and $0^{1/p} = 0$. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.2 Under [A1]: $\lVert x\rVert_\infty = 0$ forces $|x_k| \le 0$ and $|x_k| \ge 0$ for every $k<n$, hence $x = 0$; and $\lVert 0\rVert_\infty = 0$. This is (N1) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$. [step 1.5, L5, L8]

2.3 Under [A1]: for every $k<n$, $|(\lambda x)_k| = |\lambda|\,|x_k| \le |\lambda|\,\lVert x\rVert_\infty$, and choosing $j<n$ with $|x_j| = \lVert x\rVert_\infty$ gives $|(\lambda x)_j| = |\lambda|\,\lVert x\rVert_\infty$; so $|\lambda|\lVert x\rVert_\infty$ belongs to the set and bounds it above, whence $\lVert \lambda x\rVert_\infty = |\lambda|\lVert x\rVert_\infty$. This is (N2) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$. [step 1.5, L5, L6, L7]

2.4 Under [A1]: for every $k<n$, $|(x+y)_k| = |x_k+y_k| \le |x_k| + |y_k| \le \lVert x\rVert_\infty + \lVert y\rVert_\infty$; choosing $j<n$ with $|(x+y)_j| = \lVert x+y\rVert_\infty$ gives $\lVert x+y\rVert_\infty \le \lVert x\rVert_\infty + \lVert y\rVert_\infty$, which is (N3) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$. [step 1.5, L5, L6, L7]

3.1 By steps 2.1 and 1.2, $\lVert x\rVert_p = 0$ exactly when $x_k = 0$ for every $k<n$, that is exactly when $x = 0$; this is axiom (N1) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$. [step 2.1, step 1.2, L8]

3.2 Steps 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 are (N1), (N2) and (N3) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ under [A1], so clause 2 holds. [step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, A1, L8]

4.1 If $\lambda = 0$ then $\lambda x = 0$ and both sides of (N2) are $0$ by step 3.1; if $\lambda \ne 0$ then $|\lambda| > 0$, and step 1.3 with the power laws gives $\lVert \lambda x\rVert_p = \bigl(|\lambda|^{p}S(x)\bigr)^{1/p} = \bigl(|\lambda|^{p}\bigr)^{1/p}S(x)^{1/p} = |\lambda|^{p\cdot(1/p)}\lVert x\rVert_p = |\lambda|\,\lVert x\rVert_p$; this is axiom (N2). [step 1.3, step 3.1, L1, L5, L8]

5.1 Steps 3.1, 4.1 and 1.4 are (N1), (N2) and (N3) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$, so clause 1 holds. [step 1.4, step 3.1, step 4.1, L8]

6.1 Steps 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8 give clause 3, and with steps 5.1 and 3.2 all three clauses are proved; in particular the metric induced by $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n \ge 1$ is the published $d_2$, which is the consequence recorded in the Statement. [step 5.1, step 3.2, step 1.6, step 1.7, step 1.8, L9] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the consequence does and does not license.** Because the two metric spaces are literally the same, a published theorem about $(\mathbb{R}^{n}, d_2)$ may be quoted here verbatim. It may **not** be quoted with a weaker hypothesis: [[thm-euclidean-space-complete]], [[thm-heine-borel-rn]] and [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] are all stated for $n \ge 1$ only, because $d_\infty$ is a maximum over an empty index set at $n = 0$, and every item on this page that uses one of them carries $n \ge 1$ in its own statement.

- **Clause 1 holds at $n = 0$ and clause 2 does not apply there.** At $n = 0$ every $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$ is the zero function on the one-element space $\mathbb{R}^{0}$, which is the unique norm on the zero space ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]); $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ is not defined there at all.

- **The route to (N3) differs between the two families, and that is not an accident.** For $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$ the triangle inequality is Minkowski's inequality, a genuine theorem about rational powers; for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ it is the elementary argument of step 2.4, that a maximum of sums is at most the sum of the maxima. The second argument is the one that needs a nonempty index set.

## Statement

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$ and $b_0, \dots, b_{n-1}$ be
reals, with finite sums as in [[def-finite-sum]]. Then

$$\Big(\sum_{k<n} a_k b_k\Big)^{2} \;\le\; \Big(\sum_{k<n} a_k^{2}\Big)\Big(\sum_{k<n} b_k^{2}\Big),$$

and, in root form ([[thm-of-square-roots]]),

$$\Big|\sum_{k<n} a_k b_k\Big| \;\le\; \sqrt{\sum_{k<n} a_k^{2}} \; \sqrt{\sum_{k<n} b_k^{2}}.$$

Equality holds in the first display if and only if the two lists are
proportional, in the symmetric sense that there is a pair
$(\lambda, \mu) \ne (0,0)$ of reals with $\lambda a_k = \mu b_k$ for every
$k < n$.

**No root is used in the proof of the squared form.** That form is an identity
plus a sign argument in the ordered field, and the root form is only a
restatement of it through the monotonicity of squaring on the nonnegatives
([[lem-of-square-monotone]]); the root enters nowhere but the last step, where
that restatement is made and [[thm-of-square-roots]] is what supplies the
square-root symbol. This matters here, because it makes the squared
inequality independent of the existence theorem for roots.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural $n$ and reals $a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$, $b_0, \dots, b_{n-1}$. Write $A := \sum_{k<n} a_k^{2}$, $B := \sum_{k<n} a_k b_k$ and $C := \sum_{k<n} b_k^{2}$.

[L1] Laws of finite sums ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[def-finite-sum]]): additivity, scaling, monotonicity, and the fact that a sum of nonnegative terms is nonnegative and vanishes only if every term vanishes.

[L2] Squares ([[lem-of-square-positive]], [[def-integer-power]]): $x^{2} \ge 0$ for every $x$, and $x^{2} = 0$ only for $x = 0$; and a product with a zero factor vanishes, $0 \cdot x = 0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

[L3] Square roots ([[thm-of-square-roots]]): every $c \ge 0$ has a unique $\sqrt{c} \ge 0$ with $(\sqrt{c})^{2} = c$.

[L4] Monotonicity of squaring ([[lem-of-square-monotone]]): for $x, y \ge 0$, $x \le y \iff x^{2} \le y^{2}$; and $|x|^{2} = x^{2}$ with $|x| \ge 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]]).

[L5] Order arithmetic in an ordered field: adding inequalities ([[lem-of-add-order]]) and scaling an inequality by a positive element ([[lem-of-sign-rules]], claim 4) are both stated there for the STRICT order alone, so the nonstrict uses below are those statements together with the case of equality, settled by trichotomy ([[def-ordered-field]]); the inverse of a positive element is positive ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]], claim 1); and a nonzero factor cancels, since $\lambda x = 0$ with $\lambda \ne 0$ gives $x = \lambda^{-1}(\lambda x) = \lambda^{-1} \cdot 0 = 0$, a product with a zero factor ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For every $t \in \mathbb{R}$ each term $(a_k t + b_k)^{2}$ is nonnegative, so the sum is nonnegative, and expanding with additivity and scaling gives $0 \le \sum_{k<n}(a_k t + b_k)^{2} = A t^{2} + 2 B t + C$. [L1, L2]

1.2 In particular $A \ge 0$ and $C \ge 0$, being sums of squares. [L1, L2]

1.3 Proportionality forces equality: assume $\lambda a_k = \mu b_k$ for all $k < n$ with $(\lambda, \mu) \ne (0,0)$; if $\mu \ne 0$ then $b_k = c a_k$ with $c = \lambda/\mu$, so $B = cA$ and $C = c^{2}A$ by scaling, whence $B^{2} = c^{2}A^{2} = A\big(c^{2}A\big) = AC$; and if $\mu = 0$ then $\lambda \ne 0$ forces $a_k = 0$ for all $k$, so $A = B = 0$ and both sides vanish. [L1, L5]

2.1 Suppose first $A = 0$: then every term of $\sum_{k<n} a_k^{2}$ vanishes, so $a_k = 0$ for all $k < n$, hence $B = \sum_{k<n} 0 \cdot b_k = 0$ and both sides of the squared inequality are $0$, so it holds with equality; and the pair $(\lambda, \mu) = (1, 0)$ satisfies $\lambda a_k = 0 = \mu b_k$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Suppose instead $A > 0$ and substitute $t = -B/A$ into step 1.1: $0 \le A\frac{B^{2}}{A^{2}} - 2\frac{B^{2}}{A} + C = C - \frac{B^{2}}{A}$, so $\frac{B^{2}}{A} \le C$, and multiplying by $A > 0$ gives $B^{2} \le AC$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L5]

3.1 The squared inequality therefore holds in both cases, which exhaust the possibilities since $A \ge 0$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 1.2]

3.2 Equality forces proportionality: in the case $A = 0$ this was step 2.1; in the case $A > 0$, if $B^{2} = AC$ then putting $t_0 = -B/A$ in step 1.1 gives $\sum_{k<n}(a_k t_0 + b_k)^{2} = A t_0^{2} + 2Bt_0 + C = C - \frac{B^{2}}{A} = 0$, so every term vanishes and $b_k = -t_0 a_k$ for all $k$, and the pair $(\lambda, \mu) = (-t_0, 1) \ne (0,0)$ works. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, L1, L2, L5]

4.1 The root form: by step 3.1, $|B|^{2} = B^{2} \le AC = \big(\sqrt{A}\,\sqrt{C}\big)^{2}$, and both $|B|$ and $\sqrt{A}\sqrt{C}$ are nonnegative, so monotonicity of squaring on the nonnegatives gives $|B| \le \sqrt{A}\,\sqrt{C}$; note also that $\sqrt{A}\sqrt{C}$ is the nonnegative square root of $AC$, by uniqueness. [step 3.1, step 1.2, L3, L4] ∎

## Statement

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$, let $a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$ and $b_0, \dots, b_{n-1}$ be
reals, and let $p \in \mathbb{Q}$ with $p \ge 1$ ([[def-rat-order]]). Then

$$\Big(\sum_{k<n}|a_k + b_k|^{p}\Big)^{1/p} \;\le\; \Big(\sum_{k<n}|a_k|^{p}\Big)^{1/p} + \Big(\sum_{k<n}|b_k|^{p}\Big)^{1/p}.$$

All exponents appearing are positive rationals, so every power is defined for a
nonnegative base by [[def-rational-power]] and its supplementary clause
$0^{r} = 0$.

**The conjugate exponent is rational exactly because $p$ is.** For $p > 1$ the
proof runs through Hölder with $q = p/(p-1)$, and a quotient of rationals with
nonzero denominator is a rational ([[def-rat-operations]]). Had $p$ been an
arbitrary real, $q$ would still be a real, but $|a_k|^{p}$ would already be
undefined: the whole statement lives inside the rational exponents built on this
page, as the closing remark of the page explains.

**On the case $p = 1$.** It reads $\sum_{k<n}|a_k+b_k| \le \sum_{k<n}|a_k| + \sum_{k<n}|b_k|$
and follows by summing the two-term triangle inequality
([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]) termwise. It is not literally the finite-sum
triangle inequality [[lem-triangle-inequality-finite]], which compares
$\big|\sum_{k<n} c_k\big|$ with $\sum_{k<n}|c_k|$ for one list; combining the two
at $p = 1$ gives the familiar
$\big|\sum_{k<n}(a_k+b_k)\big| \le \sum_{k<n}|a_k| + \sum_{k<n}|b_k|$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural $n$, reals $a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$ and $b_0, \dots, b_{n-1}$, and a rational $p \ge 1$. Write $S := \sum_{k<n}|a_k+b_k|^{p}$, $U := \big(\sum_{k<n}|a_k|^{p}\big)^{1/p}$, $V := \big(\sum_{k<n}|b_k|^{p}\big)^{1/p}$, and $c_k := |a_k+b_k|^{\,p-1}$ when $p > 1$.

[L1] Hölder's inequality ([[thm-holder-finite]]): for conjugate rationals $p, q > 1$, $\sum_{k<n}|x_k y_k| \le \big(\sum_{k<n}|x_k|^{p}\big)^{1/p}\big(\sum_{k<n}|y_k|^{q}\big)^{1/q}$.

[L2] Laws of finite sums ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[def-finite-sum]]): additivity, scaling, monotonicity, and the fact that a sum of nonnegative terms is nonnegative.

[L3] Rational power laws ([[lem-rational-power-laws]], [[def-rational-power]], [[thm-nth-roots-exist]]): for $u > 0$ and rationals $r, s$: $u^{r} > 0$, $u^{r+s} = u^{r}u^{s}$, $\big(u^{r}\big)^{s} = u^{rs}$, $u^{1} = u$ and $u^{-r} = \big(u^{r}\big)^{-1}$; and $0^{r} = 0$ for every rational $r > 0$.

[L4] Absolute values ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]], [[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]): $|x| \ge 0$, $|xy| = |x||y|$, and $|x+y| \le |x| + |y|$.

[L5] Rational arithmetic ([[def-rat-operations]], [[def-rationals]], [[def-rat-order]]), carried out in the totally ordered field $\mathbb{Q}$ ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]], which is what makes the order comparisons below legitimate, and which supplies totality, compatibility with addition and closure of the positives under multiplication but NOT $1 > 0$; that is [[cor-of-one-positive]], valid in $\mathbb{Q}$ because $\mathbb{Q}$ is an ordered field): for rational $p > 1$ one has $p - 1 > 0$ and, since $1 > 0$, also $p > p - 1 > 0$, so the number $q := p/(p-1)$ is a rational with $q > 1$, $\frac1p + \frac1q = 1$, $(p-1)q = p$ and $1 - \frac1q = \frac1p$.

[L6] Order arithmetic: [[lem-of-add-order]] and [[lem-of-sign-rules]] state adding inequalities and scaling by a positive element for the STRICT order only, so the nonstrict forms used below (adding two $\le$, and scaling a $\le$ by a nonnegative element) are those statements together with the case of equality, which is settled by trichotomy ([[def-ordered-field]]); and the inverse of a positive element is positive ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]], claim 1).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Every quantity is defined and nonnegative: $|a_k + b_k|^{p}$, $|a_k|^{p}$ and $|b_k|^{p}$ are nonnegative because $p > 0$, hence so are $S$, $U$ and $V$. [L2, L3, L4]

1.2 The case $p = 1$: summing the two-term triangle inequality termwise and using monotonicity and additivity gives $\sum_{k<n}|a_k+b_k| \le \sum_{k<n}\big(|a_k| + |b_k|\big) = \sum_{k<n}|a_k| + \sum_{k<n}|b_k|$, and since $x^{1/1} = x$ this is exactly the assertion at $p = 1$. [L2, L3, L4]

1.3 The case $S = 0$: the left-hand side is $0^{1/p} = 0$, which is at most the nonnegative right-hand side. [L2, L3]

2.1 Assume from now on $p > 1$ and $S > 0$, and put $q := p/(p-1)$, a rational with $q > 1$ conjugate to $p$, so that $(p-1)q = p$ and $1 - \frac1q = \frac1p$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, L5]

3.1 Splitting each term: for $u \ge 0$ one has $u^{p} = u^{1 + (p-1)} = u \cdot u^{\,p-1}$, valid for $u > 0$ by the addition law and for $u = 0$ because both sides are $0$; applying this with $u = |a_k+b_k|$ and then the triangle inequality, multiplied by the nonnegative factor $c_k = |a_k+b_k|^{\,p-1}$, gives $|a_k+b_k|^{p} \le \big(|a_k| + |b_k|\big) c_k = |a_k| c_k + |b_k| c_k$ for every $k < n$. [step 2.1, L3, L4, L6]

3.2 The auxiliary list has $q$-th power sum $S$: $c_k^{\,q} = \big(|a_k+b_k|^{\,p-1}\big)^{q} = |a_k+b_k|^{(p-1)q} = |a_k+b_k|^{p}$ for $|a_k+b_k| > 0$ by the iterated-power law, and both sides are $0$ when $a_k + b_k = 0$; hence $\sum_{k<n}|c_k|^{q} = S$. [step 2.1, L3, L4]

4.1 Summing the termwise bound: $S \le \sum_{k<n}|a_k| c_k + \sum_{k<n}|b_k| c_k$. [step 3.1, L2]

4.2 Applying Hölder to the pairs $(a_k, c_k)$ and to $(b_k, c_k)$, and using $|a_k c_k| = |a_k| c_k$ since $c_k \ge 0$: $\sum_{k<n}|a_k| c_k \le U\,S^{1/q}$ and $\sum_{k<n}|b_k| c_k \le V\,S^{1/q}$. [step 3.2, step 2.1, L1, L4]

5.1 Combining, $S \le (U + V)\,S^{1/q}$. [step 4.1, step 4.2, L6]

6.1 Dividing by $S^{1/q} > 0$, which is legitimate because $S > 0$, and computing $S \big(S^{1/q}\big)^{-1} = S^{1}S^{-1/q} = S^{\,1 - 1/q} = S^{1/p}$, we obtain $S^{1/p} \le U + V$; together with the case $p = 1$ and the case $S = 0$ this proves the inequality for every rational $p \ge 1$. [step 5.1, step 2.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, L3, L5, L6] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]). Then every
$a \in F$ with $a \ge 0$ has a **unique** $s \in F$ with $s \ge 0$ and $s^2 = a$;
we write $s = \sqrt{a}$. Consequently the positive elements of $F$ are exactly the
nonzero squares: $x > 0$ if and only if $x = y^2$ for some $y \neq 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), that is, an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with the least-upper-bound property, and an element $a \in F$ with $a \ge 0$.

[L1] Every nonempty subset of $F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Sign and scaling rules: a product of positives is positive, and for $c > 0$ one has $x < y \iff cx < cy$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

[L3] Squaring is strictly monotone on the nonnegatives: if $0 \le x < y$ then $x^2 < y^2$; in particular squaring is injective on $\{x : x \ge 0\}$ ([[lem-of-square-monotone]]).

[L4] A nonzero square is positive: if $y \neq 0$ then $y^2 > 0$ ([[lem-of-square-positive]]).

[L5] Multiplying inequalities of positives: if $0 < x < y$ and $0 < u < v$ then $xu < yv$ ([[prop-of-multiply-inequalities]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 If $a = 0$, then $s = 0$ satisfies $s \ge 0$ and $s^2 = 0 = a$, so existence holds; assume henceforth $a > 0$. [given, algebra]

1.2 Uniqueness holds once a root exists: if $u, v \ge 0$ satisfy $u^2 = v^2$, then strict monotonicity of squaring on nonnegatives [L3] rules out both $u < v$ and $u > v$, forcing $u = v$; so at most one $s \ge 0$ has $s^2 = a$. [L3, given]

1.3 Define $S = \{ t \in F : t \ge 0 \text{ and } t^2 \le a \}$; then $0 \in S$ because $0 \ge 0$ and $0^2 = 0 \le a$, so $S \neq \emptyset$. [given, algebra]

1.4 The element $1 + a$ is an upper bound of $S$: since $a > 0$ we have $1 + a > 1$, so any $t > 1 + a$ has $t > 1$ and $t > 0$, whence $t^2 = t \cdot t > 1 \cdot t = t > 1 + a > a$, giving $t \notin S$. [given, L2]

2.1 By completeness [L1], $s := \sup S$ exists in $F$; and since $0 \in S$ we have $s \ge 0$. [L1, step 1.3, step 1.4]

3.1 Assume, for contradiction, that $s^2 \neq a$; by trichotomy either $s^2 < a$ or $s^2 > a$. [assume-contra, step 2.1]

4.1 (Case $s^2 < a$.) Choose $h$ with $0 < h < 1$ and $h < \dfrac{a - s^2}{2s + 1}$, possible since $a - s^2 > 0$ and $2s + 1 \ge 1 > 0$; then $h^2 = h \cdot h < h \cdot 1 = h$ and $h(2s+1) < a - s^2$, so $(s+h)^2 = s^2 + 2sh + h^2 < s^2 + 2sh + h = s^2 + h(2s+1) < a$, whence $s + h \in S$ with $s + h > s$, contradicting that $s$ is an upper bound of $S$. [assume-case low, step 3.1, step 2.1, L2, L5, choose]

4.2 (Case $s^2 > a$.) Here $s > 0$ since $s^2 > a \ge 0$; choose $h$ with $0 < h < s$ and $h < \dfrac{s^2 - a}{2s}$, so $2sh < s^2 - a$ and $(s-h)^2 = s^2 - 2sh + h^2 \ge s^2 - 2sh > a$, hence every $t \in S$ has $t^2 \le a < (s-h)^2$ with $t \ge 0$ and $s - h > 0$, so $t < s - h$ by [L3]; thus $s - h$ is an upper bound of $S$ with $s - h < s$, contradicting that $s$ is the least upper bound. [assume-case high, step 3.1, step 2.1, L3, choose]

5.1 Both cases of the disjunction in step 3.1 give a contradiction, so the assumption fails and $s^2 = a$: a unique (by step 1.2) $s = \sqrt{a} \ge 0$ with $s^2 = a$ exists, and applying this to any $x > 0$ writes $x = (\sqrt{x})^2$ with $\sqrt{x} \neq 0$ while conversely any nonzero square is positive by [L4], so the positive elements of $F$ are exactly the nonzero squares. [step 4.1, step 4.2, step 3.1, step 1.2, L4, cases, discharge-contradiction] ∎
