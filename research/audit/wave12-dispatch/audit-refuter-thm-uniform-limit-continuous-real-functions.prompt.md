You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as
an independent adversarial proof-refuter. Return evidence only; Audit-Alpha
alone adjudicates and edits.

## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` Statement or consumer, actively search for a
counterexample or a failure in the witness or cited generated premise. A false
public claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or
materially inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is
nonfatal.

Return no more than 450 words, exactly in this shape:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

For each defect:

```text
FINDING 1
  location: [exact section/fact/step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [exact assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]
```

Always end with:

```text
BOUNDARY: [specific boundary/counterexample checks and disposition]
SOURCES:  [confirm every supplied cited item used by the target was inspected]
CHECKED:  [confirm title, public claim, every numbered step, and Remarks]
```

## Statement

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space and let $f_k:X\to\mathbb{R}$ be continuous for
every $k\in\mathbb{N}$, where $\mathbb{R}$ has its usual metric
$d_{\mathbb{R}}(s,t)=|s-t|$. If $f_k\to f$ uniformly on $X$, then
$f:X\to\mathbb{R}$ is continuous.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A metric space $(X,d)$, continuous functions $f_k:X\to\mathbb{R}$, and uniform convergence $f_k\to f$.

[A1] Uniform convergence gives, for every real $\eta>0$, one index $N$ such that $|f_k(x)-f(x)|<\eta$ for every $k\ge N$ and every $x\in X$ ([[def-pointwise-uniform-and-uniformly-cauchy-convergence]]).

[A2] Continuity of $f_N$ at $a$ means that for every real $\eta>0$ there is $\delta>0$ such that $d(x,a)<\delta$ implies $|f_N(x)-f_N(a)|<\eta$ ([[def-metric-continuity]], [[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]).

[L1] For reals $u,v$, $|u+v|\le|u|+|v|$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Fix $a\in X$ and a real $\varepsilon>0$. By uniform convergence choose $N$ such that $|f_N(x)-f(x)|<\varepsilon/3$ for every $x\in X$. [A1, choose]

1.2 By continuity of $f_N$ at $a$, choose $\delta>0$ such that $d(x,a)<\delta$ implies $|f_N(x)-f_N(a)|<\varepsilon/3$. [A2, choose]

2.1 If $d(x,a)<\delta$, then $|f(x)-f(a)|\le |f(x)-f_N(x)|+|f_N(x)-f_N(a)|+|f_N(a)-f(a)|<\varepsilon$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1, algebra]

3.1 Thus $f$ is continuous at the arbitrary point $a$, and hence continuous on $X$. [step 2.1, A2] ∎

## Definition

Let $(X, d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$ be metric spaces ([[def-metric-space]]), let
$f : X \to Y$ be a function and let $a \in X$.

$f$ is **continuous at $a$** if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ such that

$$d_X(x,a) < \delta \;\Longrightarrow\; d_Y\big(f(x), f(a)\big) < \varepsilon \qquad \text{for all } x \in X .$$

$f$ is **continuous** (globally, or on $X$) if it is continuous at every point of
$X$.

**The same condition in balls.** Since $d_X(x,a) < \delta$ says $x \in B_X(a,\delta)$
and $d_Y(f(x),f(a)) < \varepsilon$ says $f(x) \in B_Y(f(a),\varepsilon)$
([[def-metric-ball]]), continuity at $a$ reads: for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there
is $\delta > 0$ with

$$f\big[B_X(a,\delta)\big] \subseteq B_Y\big(f(a), \varepsilon\big).$$

Both forms are used below and are the same statement written twice.

**Both metrics matter, and both are named.** Continuity is a property of the
triple $(d_X, d_Y, f)$, not of $f$ alone. When several metrics on the same
underlying sets are in play, as in [[def-equivalent-metrics]], the metrics are
always written out.

**Quantifier order.** The $\delta$ is allowed to depend on $\varepsilon$ **and on
the point $a$**. Requiring one $\delta$ to work at every point simultaneously is
a strictly stronger condition, uniform continuity; it is defined on a later page
of this library, and at this point in the reading order it is written out in full
where needed ([[def-equivalent-metrics]]).

## Remarks

- **Nothing is claimed here beyond the definition.** That continuity is
  equivalent to preimages of open sets being open, to preimages of closed sets
  being closed, to sequential continuity, and to
  $f[\overline{A}] \subseteq \overline{f[A]}$, is the theorem
  [[thm-metric-continuity-characterisations]].
- **Continuity at a point is a local condition**: it depends only on the values
  of $f$ on any one ball around $a$, since the condition may always be tested
  with a smaller $\delta$.
- Every isometric embedding is continuous, with $\delta = \varepsilon$
  ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]], [[lem-isometry-is-an-embedding]]), and
  so is every map that does not increase distances, such as $u \mapsto d(u,A)$
  ([[lem-distance-to-set-is-lipschitz]]).

## Definition

Let $X$ be a set and, for each $k \in \mathbb{N}$, let
$f_k : X \to \mathbb{R}$ be a real-valued function
([[def-function-space]]). Let $f : X \to \mathbb{R}$.

The sequence $(f_k)$ **converges pointwise** to $f$ on $X$ when, for every
$x \in X$, the real sequence $(f_k(x))$ converges to $f(x)$
([[def-real-limit]]). Thus the index after which
$|f_k(x)-f(x)|<\varepsilon$ may depend on both $\varepsilon$ and $x$.

The sequence $(f_k)$ **converges uniformly** to $f$ on $X$ when

$$(\forall \varepsilon>0)(\exists N\in\mathbb{N})(\forall k\ge N)(\forall x\in X)\quad |f_k(x)-f(x)|<\varepsilon,$$

where $\varepsilon$ ranges over the positive reals. Here one index $N$ serves
every point of $X$.

The sequence $(f_k)$ is **uniformly Cauchy** on $X$ when

$$(\forall \varepsilon>0)(\exists N\in\mathbb{N})(\forall m,n\ge N)(\forall x\in X)\quad |f_m(x)-f_n(x)|<\varepsilon.$$

For each of the three notions above, restricting the error to positive
rationals gives an equivalent condition. The real-error condition immediately
implies the rational-error condition. Conversely, given a real $\eta>0$,
choose $n\ge1$ with $1/n<\eta$ by
[[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]]; the condition for the positive rational
$1/n$ implies the condition for $\eta$. The real-error form is used because
it makes the uniform quantifiers transparent.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$. Then

$$|x + y| \le |x| + |y|.$$

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and elements $x, y \in F$.

[L1] For every $u \in F$, $-|u| \le u \le |u|$, and $|u|$ equals $u$ or $-u$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L2] Order compatible with addition: if $a \le b$ and $c \le d$, then $a + c \le b + d$. [[lem-of-add-order]] states the STRICT forms and only those ($a < b \Rightarrow a + c < b + c$, and $a < b$ with $c < d$ giving $a + c < b + d$); the nonstrict form used here is those two together with the cases $a = b$ and $c = d$, settled by trichotomy, the order being total ([[def-ordered-field]]). Explicitly: if $a < b$ and $c < d$ the second strict form applies; if $a < b$ and $c = d$ the first gives $a + c < b + c = b + d$; if $a = b$ and $c < d$ the first gives $a + c < a + d = b + d$; and if $a = b$ and $c = d$ the two sides are equal.

[L3] Field and order arithmetic: $-(a + b) = -a + (-b)$, and $a \le b \iff -b \le -a$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L1], $-|x| \le x \le |x|$ and $-|y| \le y \le |y|$. [L1]

2.1 Adding the two chains of [step 1.1] with [L2] and using $-(|x| + |y|) = -|x| + (-|y|)$ from [L3] gives $-(|x| + |y|) \le x + y \le |x| + |y|$. [step 1.1, L2, L3]

3.1 By [L1] the value $|x + y|$ equals $x + y$ or $-(x + y)$; both $x + y \le |x| + |y|$ and $-(x + y) \le |x| + |y|$ hold by [step 2.1] and [L3] (the latter from $-(|x| + |y|) \le x + y$), so $|x + y| \le |x| + |y|$. [step 2.1, L1, L3] ∎

## Statement

Define $d_{\mathbb{R}} : \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ by
$d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) := |x - y|$ ([[def-abs-value]]). Then:

1. $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ is a metric on $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-metric-space]]); it is
   called the **usual metric** of $\mathbb{R}$.
2. For $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and $r > 0$ the open ball is the bounded open interval
   ([[def-interval]], [[def-metric-ball]])
   $$B(x,r) = (x-r,\ x+r),$$
   and the closed ball is $\bar B(x,r) = [x-r,\ x+r]$.
3. Consequently $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is open in the metric topology of
   $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-metric-topology]]) exactly when for every $x \in U$
   there is $r > 0$ with $(x-r, x+r) \subseteq U$. This topology is called the
   **usual topology** of $\mathbb{R}$.
4. $(\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$ is not a bounded metric space
   ([[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]): no ball contains $\mathbb{R}$, so
   $\operatorname{diam}(\mathbb{R})$ is not defined.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The complete ordered field $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]), and the function $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) = |x-y|$; points $x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}$ and a real $r > 0$.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| \ge 0$; $|u| = 0$ if and only if $u = 0$; $|-u| = |u|$; and for $c > 0$ one has $|u| < c$ if and only if $-c < u < c$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Triangle inequality in an ordered field: $|u + v| \le |u| + |v|$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L3] Intervals: $(a,b) = \{t : a < t < b\}$ and $[a,b] = \{t : a \le t \le b\}$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L4] Archimedean property: for every $w \in \mathbb{R}$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $w < n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); and $n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L5] Adding a constant to an inequality, in strict and nonstrict form: the strict form is [[lem-of-add-order]] and the nonstrict form is that together with the case of equality, the order being total ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L6] Trichotomy: for reals $a,b$ exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Separation (M1): $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) = |x-y| = 0$ holds if and only if $x - y = 0$, that is if and only if $x = y$. [L1]

1.2 Symmetry (M2): $d_{\mathbb{R}}(y,x) = |y-x| = |-(x-y)| = |x-y| = d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y)$. [L1]

1.3 Triangle inequality (M3): $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,z) = |x - z| = |(x-y) + (y-z)| \le |x-y| + |y-z| = d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) + d_{\mathbb{R}}(y,z)$. [L2]

1.4 For $y \in \mathbb{R}$ and $r > 0$: $y \in B(x,r)$ means $|x - y| < r$, which by [L1] holds if and only if $-r < x - y < r$, and adding $y - r$ respectively $y + r$ to the two halves shows this is equivalent to $x - r < y < x + r$. [L1, L5]

1.5 For $y \in \mathbb{R}$ and $r > 0$: $y \in \bar B(x,r)$ means $|x-y| \le r$, which by the same equivalence read with $\le$ in place of $<$ holds if and only if $x - r \le y \le x + r$. [L1, L5]

1.6 Let $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ and $r > 0$ be arbitrary, and use [L4] to fix a natural $n \ge 1$ with $x_0 + r < n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$; write $w := n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$. [L4, choose]

2.1 By steps 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 the function $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ satisfies (M1), (M2) and (M3), so it is a metric on $\mathbb{R}$, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3]

2.2 By step 1.4 and [L3] the set $B(x,r)$ has exactly the elements of $(x-r,x+r)$, and by step 1.5 and [L3] the set $\bar B(x,r)$ has exactly the elements of $[x-r,x+r]$; this is claim 2. [step 1.4, step 1.5, L3]

2.3 Since $r > 0$ we have $x_0 < x_0 + r < w$, so $w - x_0 > r > 0$ and hence $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x_0, w) = |x_0 - w| = |-(w - x_0)| = w - x_0 > r$; therefore $w \notin B(x_0,r)$. [step 1.6, L1, L5, L6]

3.1 Substituting claim 2 into the definition of open in the metric topology gives claim 3: $U$ is open exactly when every $x \in U$ admits $r > 0$ with $(x-r,x+r) = B(x,r) \subseteq U$. [step 2.2]

4.1 Since $x_0$ and $r$ were arbitrary, step 2.3 exhibits for every ball $B(x_0,r)$ a real not in it, so no ball contains $\mathbb{R}$; hence $\mathbb{R}$ is not a bounded subset of itself and $\operatorname{diam}(\mathbb{R})$ is not defined, which is claim 4. [step 2.1, step 2.3] ∎

## Remarks

- **This is the metric every later ceiling rests on.** Every real-line example on the companion page, and every subspace of $\mathbb{R}$ used there, takes its metric from $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ through the subspace construction of [[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]].
- **Unboundedness needs no Archimedean input, and no completeness either.** No ordered field is bounded under $d(u,v) = |u-v|$, and the reason is a single element rather than any cofinality property: given a centre $c$ and a radius $r > 0$, the element $c + r + 1$ satisfies $d(c,\, c + r + 1) = |{-(r+1)}| = r + 1 > r$, because $1 > 0$ and $r + 1 > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]]); so it lies outside $B(c,r)$ and no ball contains the field. Step 1.6 above chooses its witness with [[thm-of-archimedean]] instead, which is a convenience and not a necessity: it delivers a witness that is a canonical natural, and claim 4 needs no such thing. Claim 4 therefore holds verbatim in every ordered field with this $d$, Archimedean or not. Note also that a radius is an element of $\mathbb{R}$, so "a ball of infinite radius" is not something that can be written here.
- **The claim that $\operatorname{diam}(\mathbb{R})$ is "not defined" is a claim about the conventions of this development** ([[rem-sup-conventions]], [[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]): suprema here are real numbers and the extended real line, which is introduced on a later page, is not used for them, so an unbounded set has no diameter at all rather than a diameter $+\infty$.
