## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` Statement or consumer, actively search for a
counterexample or a failure in the witness or cited generated premise. A false
public claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or
materially inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is
nonfatal.

## Statement

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$. Then any two norms on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are
equivalent ([[def-equivalent-norms]], [[def-norm-and-normed-space]]).

More precisely, for every norm $N$ on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ there are reals
$c > 0$ and $C' > 0$ with

$$c\,\lVert x\rVert_2 \;\le\; N(x) \;\le\; C'\,\lVert x\rVert_2 \qquad \text{for every } x \in \mathbb{R}^{n},$$

and the general statement follows because equivalence of norms is an equivalence
relation.

**Consequently all the metric notions on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are norm independent**
for $n \ge 1$: any two norms give the same open sets, the same convergent
sequences with the same limits, the same Cauchy sequences and the same uniformly
continuous maps ([[def-equivalent-norms]]).

**The hypothesis $n \ge 1$ is used twice in the proof and both uses are marked**:
once so that the constant $C$ of
[[lem-every-norm-on-rn-is-continuous-for-the-euclidean-metric]] exists, and once
so that the Euclidean unit sphere is **nonempty**, which is what the extreme
value theorem needs. At $n = 0$ the conclusion is true but vacuous, the zero
space carrying exactly one norm ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]), and it is not
obtained from the argument below.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural $n \ge 1$, the space $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with the norms of [[def-p-norms-on-rn]] and the published metric $d_2$ ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]], [[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]]), and a norm $N$ on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$; write $S := \{\, x \in \mathbb{R}^{n} : \lVert x\rVert_2 = 1 \,\}$.

[L1] For $n \ge 1$: $C := \max\{N(e_k) : k<n\}$ exists with $C \ge 0$, $N(x) \le C\lVert x\rVert_1$, $\lVert x\rVert_1 \le \sqrt{\iota(n)}\lVert x\rVert_2$, and $N$ is continuous as a map $(\mathbb{R}^{n}, d_2) \to (\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$ ([[lem-every-norm-on-rn-is-continuous-for-the-euclidean-metric]] clauses 2, 3, 4).

[L2] Equivalence of norms is an equivalence relation, and $c M \le N \le C M$ with $c, C > 0$ is what it means ([[def-equivalent-norms]]).

[L3] Heine-Borel in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n \ge 1$: a subset of $(\mathbb{R}^{n},d_2)$ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded ([[thm-heine-borel-rn]] clause 2, [[def-metric-compactness]], [[def-metric-topology]], [[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]).

[L4] Extreme value theorem: a continuous real-valued function on a **nonempty** compact metric space attains a least value ([[thm-extreme-value-metric]]).

[L5] Continuity characterisations: a map of metric spaces continuous at every point has closed preimages of closed sets ([[thm-metric-continuity-characterisations]], clause (c)).

[L6] Balls, openness and boundedness ([[def-metric-ball]], [[def-metric-topology]], [[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]): $U$ is open when every point of $U$ has a ball inside $U$; $A$ is bounded when $A = \emptyset$ or $A \subseteq B(x_0,r)$ for some $x_0$ and real $r>0$.

[L7] The norm axioms (N1) and (N2), and nonnegativity of a norm ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]).

[L8] The standard basis vector $e_0 \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ exists for $n \ge 1$, with $e_0(0) = 1$ and $e_0(j) = 0$ for $0 \ne j < n$ ([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]]); hence $\lVert e_0\rVert_2 = \sqrt{1} = 1$ ([[def-p-norms-on-rn]], [[thm-of-square-roots]]).

[L9] Inverses: $u > 0$ gives $u^{-1} > 0$, and trichotomy of the order of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L10] Continuity at a point in the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ form, and the metric subspace $(A, d_A)$ with $d_A$ the restriction of $d$ ([[def-metric-continuity]], [[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]], [[def-metric-compactness]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The singleton $\{1\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is closed: if $y \ne 1$ then $r := |y-1| > 0$ and the ball $B(y,r)$ omits $1$, so the complement of $\{1\}$ is open. [L6, L9]

1.2 $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ is itself a norm on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, so by [L1] applied to it, $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2 : (\mathbb{R}^{n},d_2) \to (\mathbb{R},d_{\mathbb{R}})$ is continuous. [L1, L7]

1.3 $S \subseteq B(0,2)$, since $x \in S$ gives $d_2(x,0) = \lVert x\rVert_2 = 1 < 2$; so $S$ is bounded. [L6, L7]

1.4 $e_0 \in S$, because $\lVert e_0\rVert_2 = 1$; this is where $n \ge 1$ is used, since for $n = 0$ there is no index $0 < n$ and no such vector. So $S \ne \emptyset$. [L8]

1.5 For every $a \in S$ and every real $\varepsilon > 0$, a $\delta > 0$ witnessing continuity of $N$ at $a$ as a map on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ also witnesses it for the restriction $N|_S$ on the metric subspace $(S, d_S)$, because $d_S$ is the restriction of $d_2$ and the condition is quantified over fewer points; so $N|_S$ is continuous. [L1, L10]

1.6 Put $C' := C\sqrt{\iota(n)} + 1$, a real $> 0$. By [L1], $N(x) \le C\lVert x\rVert_1 \le C\sqrt{\iota(n)}\lVert x\rVert_2 \le C'\lVert x\rVert_2$, the last step because $\lVert x\rVert_2 \ge 0$. [L1, L7]

2.1 $S$ is the preimage of $\{1\}$ under the continuous $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$, hence closed in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L5]

3.1 $S$ is a compact subset of $(\mathbb{R}^{n},d_2)$, being closed and bounded. [step 1.3, step 2.1, L3]

4.1 By the extreme value theorem applied to the nonempty compact metric space $(S,d_S)$ and the continuous $N|_S$, there is $x_{\min} \in S$ with $N(x_{\min}) \le N(x)$ for every $x \in S$; put $c := N(x_{\min})$. [step 1.4, step 1.5, step 3.1, L4]

5.1 $c > 0$: from $x_{\min} \in S$ we get $\lVert x_{\min}\rVert_2 = 1 \ne 0$, so $x_{\min} \ne 0$ by (N1) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$, so $N(x_{\min}) \ne 0$ by (N1) for $N$, and $N(x_{\min}) \ge 0$; trichotomy leaves $c > 0$. [step 4.1, L7, L9]

5.2 Let $x \ne 0$. Then $\lVert x\rVert_2 > 0$ by (N1) and nonnegativity, so $t := 1/\lVert x\rVert_2 > 0$ and $u := t\,x$ satisfies $\lVert u\rVert_2 = |t|\,\lVert x\rVert_2 = 1$ by (N2); hence $u \in S$ and $c \le N(u) = |t|\,N(x) = N(x)/\lVert x\rVert_2$, that is $c\,\lVert x\rVert_2 \le N(x)$. [step 4.1, L7, L9]

6.1 For $x = 0$ both $c\lVert x\rVert_2$ and $N(x)$ are $0$ by (N1), so $c\lVert x\rVert_2 \le N(x)$ holds for every $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$. [step 5.2, L7]

7.1 Steps 5.1, 6.1 and 1.6 give $c\lVert x\rVert_2 \le N(x) \le C'\lVert x\rVert_2$ with $c, C' > 0$, so every norm $N$ on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is equivalent to $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$. [step 5.1, step 6.1, step 1.6, L2]

8.1 Given two norms $M$ and $N$ on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, each is equivalent to $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ by step 7.1, so $M$ is equivalent to $N$ by symmetry and transitivity of the relation. [step 7.1, L2] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the proof spends, and where it stops.** The only nonelementary ingredients are compactness of the Euclidean unit sphere, obtained from [[thm-heine-borel-rn]], and the extreme value theorem [[thm-extreme-value-metric]]. Heine-Borel in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is proved by bisection and uses no choice principle, and the extreme value theorem is a theorem of ZF ([[rem-compactness-choice-ledger-metric]]), so this theorem costs no choice either.

- **The sphere is where the argument is finite-dimensional.** The step that fails outside $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is step 3.1: closed and bounded gives compact by [[thm-heine-borel-rn]], a theorem about $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for a natural $n$ and about nothing else. The companion page exhibits a real vector space carrying two inequivalent norms, and the same space with a closed bounded set that is not compact. **This remark is a statement about this proof and about that witness; no claim is made here about normed spaces in general, a theory this library has not built.**

- **The constants are not canonical.** Nothing in the statement fixes $c$ or $C'$, and the proof produces one admissible pair, not the best one. Sharp constants for the three named norms on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ are computed on the companion page.

That is the **strongest** of the three tiers that item distinguishes: by [[thm-metric-equivalence-hierarchy]], Lipschitz equivalence implies uniform equivalence, which implies topological equivalence. So equivalent norms give - the same open sets, hence the same closed sets, closures and interiors ([[def-metric-topology]]); - the same uniformly continuous maps into and out of $V$ ([[def-metric-uniform-continuity]]); - the same convergent sequences with the same limits, and the same Cauchy sequences ([[def-metric-convergence]], [[def-cauchy-in-metric]]). The last line deserves its two-line verification, since it is used constantly below and is not literally a clause of [[thm-metric-equivalence-hierarchy]]. If $d_M(v_k, v) \\to 0$ then $0 \\le d_N(v_k,v) \\le C\\,d_M(v_k,v)$, so given a rational $\\varepsilon > 0$ an index beyond which $d_M(v_k,v) < \\varepsilon/C$ serves for $d_N$; the converse uses $d_M \\le c^{-1}d_N$ in the same way. The Cauchy statement is the same estimate applied to $d_N(v_k,v_l)$. In particular $(V, d_M)$ is complete if and only if $(V,d_N)$ is. **Naming.** Many texts say *strongly equivalent* for what [[def-equivalent-metrics]] calls Lipschitz equivalent, and simply *equivalent* for what it calls topologically equivalent. As there, this library always writes the qualifier for metrics. For **norms** there is no fork to guard against: the condition displayed above is the only one anyone calls equivalence of norms, and it is always the Lipschitz-strength one.",

Taking the intrinsic reading as the definition is what makes \"compact\" a property of the metric space $(A,d_A)$ alone, so that a set compact in one ambient space is compact in every other one containing it isometrically. **The empty space is compact**, since the empty subfamily of any family covers it; this is the reason the clause above is written with the two cases. The one-point space is compact too, and so is every space listed as $\\{x_0, \\dots, x_n\\}$: given a cover, each $x_i$ lies in some member, and finitely many members chosen in this way already cover. **The finiteness convention, and how it is used both ways.** \"Finite\" above is the listing form, matching the finite lists of [[def-finite-intersection-property]]. It agrees with the definition of finiteness by equinumerosity with a natural number ([[def-countable]]), and both directions of the agreement are available and are used below: - A nonempty finite set $F$ in the sense of [[def-countable]] satisfies $F \\approx m$ for some $m \\ge 1$, and a bijection $m \\to F$ is exactly a listing $F = \\{a_0, \\dots, a_{m-1}\\}$. - Conversely a set listed as $A = \\{a_0, \\dots, a_n\\}$, that is the image of a function $a$ with domain $\\sigma(n)$, is finite in the sense of [[def-countable]]: the map sending $x \\in A$ to the least $i \\le n$ with $a_i = x$ is an injection of $A$ into $\\sigma(n)$, so $A$ is equinumerous with a subset of $\\mathbb{N}$ bounded above, and such a subset is finite ([[lem-subset-of-countable]]). Neither direction uses a choice principle: the second selects nothing, taking a least index instead.",

Let $V$ be a vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$, with zero vector $0_V$. A **norm on $V$** is a function $N : V \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that for all $u, v \\in V$ and all $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$: - **(N1) Separation.** $N(v) = 0$ if and only if $v = 0_V$. - **(N2) Absolute homogeneity.** $N(\\lambda v) = |\\lambda|\\,N(v)$, the absolute value being that of [[def-abs-value]]. - **(N3) Triangle inequality.** $N(u + v) \\le N(u) + N(v)$. A **normed space** is a pair $(V, N)$ consisting of a vector space $V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ and a norm $N$ on it. When only one norm is in play we write $\\lVert v\\rVert$ for $N(v)$; when several are, the norm is always named. **The values of a norm are real numbers.** The codomain is $\\mathbb{R}$, so $N(v)$ is an honest element of the complete ordered field and no infinite value is permitted. This is the same convention [[rem-metric-axiom-conventions]] records for metrics. ### Nonnegativity is a theorem, not an axiom Many texts add a fourth condition $N(v) \\ge 0$. It is redundant. Applying (N2) with $\\lambda = -1$ gives $N(-v) = |-1|\\,N(v) = N(v)$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]] for $(-1)v = -v$), and then (N3) with $u = v$ and $-v$ gives $$0 \\;=\\; N(0_V) \\;=\\; N\\bigl(v + (-v)\\bigr) \\;\\le\\; N(v) + N(-v) \\;=\\; N(v) + N(v),$$ where $N(0_V) = 0$ is (N1). So $N(v) + N(v) \\ge 0$, and if $N(v) < 0$ then $N(v) + N(v) < 0$ by addition of inequalities, which trichotomy forbids ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]). Hence $N(v) \\ge 0$ for every $v \\in V$. **Consequently the verification of a candidate norm has three things to check and not four**, exactly as the verification of a candidate metric has three and not four ([[def-metric-space]], [[lem-metric-nonnegativity]]). No item in this library assumes nonnegativity of a norm before the argument above. ### The induced metric Let $N$ be a norm on $V$ and define $$d_N(u,v) \\;:=\\; N(u - v) \\qquad (u, v \\in V),$$ where $u - v = u + (-v)$ ([[def-vector-space]]). **Then $d_N$ is a metric on $V$** ([[def-metric-space]]), and the three axioms are the three conditions above, in order: - **(M1)** $d_N(u,v) = 0$ means $N(u-v) = 0$, which by (N1) says $u - v = 0_V$, that is $u = v$; and conversely $d_N(v,v) = N(0_V) = 0$. - **(M2)** $d_N(v,u) = N(v-u) = N\\bigl((-1)(u-v)\\bigr) = |-1|\\,N(u-v) = d_N(u,v)$, by (N2), [[lem-of-abs-value]] and $(-1)w = -w$ ([[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]]). - **(M3)** $d_N(u,w) = N\\bigl((u-v) + (v-w)\\bigr) \\le N(u-v) + N(v-w) = d_N(u,v) + d_N(v,w)$, by (N3). A normed space is therefore a metric space, and every notion defined for metric spaces — open set ([[def-metric-topology]]), convergence, Cauchyness, continuity, compactness — is available in it with no further definition. **This library never introduces a second notion of any of them for normed spaces.** ### Two properties an arbitrary metric need not have The metric $d_N$ satisfies, for all $u, v, w \\in V$ and $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$: - **translation invariance**, $d_N(u + w, v + w) = N\\bigl((u+w)-(v+w)\\bigr) = N(u-v) = d_N(u,v)$; - **absolute homogeneity**, $d_N(\\lambda u, \\lambda v) = N\\bigl(\\lambda(u-v)\\bigr) = |\\lambda|\\,d_N(u,v)$, by (N2). **Not every metric on a vector space arises from a norm**, and homogeneity is what fails. The published bounded remetrisation [[lem-bounded-remetrisation]] replaces a metric $d$ by $d' = \\min\\{d, 1\\}$, a metric with the same topology whose values never exceed $1$; on a vector space $V$ containing a vector $v$ with $d(v, 0_V) > 0$ this $d'$ cannot be $d_M$ for any norm $M$, since absolute homogeneity would force $d'(\\lambda v, 0_V) = |\\lambda|\\,d'(v, 0_V)$, which is unbounded in $\\lambda$, while $d'$ is bounded by $1$. So the passage from norms to metrics is not reversible, and a statement about a metric on a vector space is strictly weaker than the corresponding statement about a norm.",

For $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ put $$\\lVert x\\rVert_p \\;:=\\; \\Bigl(\\sum_{k<n} |x_k|^{p}\\Bigr)^{1/p},$$ where $|\\cdot|$ is the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]), the sum is the finite sum of [[def-finite-sum]], and both powers are the **rational** powers of [[def-rational-power]]. **Every power written here is defined.** Each base $|x_k|$ is a nonnegative real and $p > 0$, so $|x_k|^{p}$ is given by [[def-rational-power]] for $|x_k| > 0$ and by its supplementary clause $0^{p} = 0$ for $|x_k| = 0$; the sum of these nonnegative terms is nonnegative ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 4), and $1/p$ is a positive rational, so the outer power is defined for the same two reasons. The value does not depend on which representative of $p$ or of $1/p$ is used ([[lem-rational-power-well-defined]]). **The exponent is a rational, and that is not a matter of taste.** [[def-rational-power]] supplies $a^{r}$ for a nonnegative base and a **rational** exponent only; real exponents do not exist at this point in the reading order, and [[rem-real-exponents-deferred]] records exactly why. This is also why the published Minkowski inequality [[thm-minkowski-finite]], which is what makes the triangle inequality work below, is itself stated for rational $p \\ge 1$. **No statement on this page is written for $p$ ranging over a real interval.** ### The maximum norm For $n \\ge 1$ and $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ put $$\\lVert x\\rVert_\\infty \\;:=\\; \\max\\{\\, |x_k| \\;:\\; k < n \\,\\},$$ the maximum of a nonempty finite set of reals, which exists and is one of its elements ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]). **The hypothesis $n \\ge 1$ is required and propagates.** At $n = 0$ the set $\\{|x_k| : k<n\\}$ is empty and has no maximum ([[def-max-min]]). This is the same restriction the published [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] carries, for the same reason, and **every statement on this page that mentions $\\lVert\\cdot\\rVert_\\infty$ inherits it**. The $p$-norms for rational $p \\ge 1$ carry no such restriction: at $n = 0$ each is the empty sum raised to a positive rational power, hence $0$. ### The three cases the rest of the page uses - $\\lVert x\\rVert_1 = \\sum_{k<n}|x_k|$, since $t^{1} = t$ for $t \\ge 0$ ([[lem-rational-power-laws]], and $0^{1} = 0$ by the supplementary clause). - $\\lVert x\\rVert_2 = \\bigl(\\sum_{k<n}|x_k|^{2}\\bigr)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{k<n}x_k^{2}}$, which is exactly the Euclidean norm of [[def-euclidean-inner-product]]: the exponent $2$ agrees with the integer power, so $|x_k|^{2} = x_k^{2}$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]), and $t^{1/2}$ is the unique nonnegative square root of $t$, which is $\\sqrt{t}$ ([[def-rational-power]], [[thm-of-square-roots]]). **The two notations denote the same function and no second Euclidean norm is introduced.** - $\\lVert x\\rVert_\\infty$ as above, for $n \\ge 1$. That each of these is a norm in the sense of [[def-norm-and-normed-space]], and that the metrics they induce are exactly the published $d_1$, $d_2$ and $d_\\infty$ of [[lem-metrics-on-rn]], is [[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]]; it is proved there and is not assumed here.",

The two readings do agree, but that is a theorem and not a convention: it is [[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]], and no item of this library may use the ambient reading without citing it. Taking the intrinsic reading as the definition is what makes \"compact\" a property of the metric space $(A,d_A)$ alone, so that a set compact in one ambient space is compact in every other one containing it isometrically. **The empty space is compact**, since the empty subfamily of any family covers it; this is the reason the clause above is written with the two cases. The one-point space is compact too, and so is every space listed as $\\{x_0, \\dots, x_n\\}$: given a cover, each $x_i$ lies in some member, and finitely many members chosen in this way already cover. **The finiteness convention, and how it is used both ways.** \"Finite\" above is the listing form, matching the finite lists of [[def-finite-intersection-property]]. It agrees with the definition of finiteness by equinumerosity with a natural number ([[def-countable]]), and both directions of the agreement are available and are used below: - A nonempty finite set $F$ in the sense of [[def-countable]] satisfies $F \\approx m$ for some $m \\ge 1$, and a bijection $m \\to F$ is exactly a listing $F = \\{a_0, \\dots, a_{m-1}\\}$. - Conversely a set listed as $A = \\{a_0, \\dots, a_n\\}$, that is the image of a function $a$ with domain $\\sigma(n)$, is finite in the sense of [[def-countable]]: the map sending $x \\in A$ to the least $i \\le n$ with $a_i = x$ is an injection of $A$ into $\\sigma(n)$, so $A$ is equinumerous with a subset of $\\mathbb{N}$ bounded above, and such a subset is finite ([[lem-subset-of-countable]]).

## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq F$.

- $u \in F$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$; $S$ is
  **bounded above** if it has an upper bound.
- $u \in F$ is a **least upper bound** (or **supremum**, $\sup S$) of $S$ if $u$
  is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le u'$ for every upper bound $u'$ of $S$.

$F$ is a **complete ordered field** (equivalently, $F$ has the
**least-upper-bound property**, or is **Dedekind complete**) if every nonempty
$S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$.

## Remarks

- A least upper bound, if it exists, is unique (two least upper bounds are each
  $\le$ the other, so equal by antisymmetry of the order).
- Applying the property to $\{-s : s \in S\}$ yields the dual **greatest lower
  bound** (infimum) property, so the two are equivalent.
- The Dedekind-cut reals have this property by construction
  ([[thm-dedekind-complete]]); the Cauchy-sequence reals acquire it via
  [[cor-cauchy-reals-lub-complete]]. This definition is the target for the
  uniqueness theorem [[thm-uniqueness-complete-ordered-field]].

## Definition

Let $V$ be a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-vector-space]]) and let $M$
and $N$ be norms on $V$ ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]). $M$ and $N$ are
**equivalent** when there are reals $c > 0$ and $C > 0$ with

$$c\,M(v) \;\le\; N(v) \;\le\; C\,M(v) \qquad \text{for every } v \in V .$$

The constants are not part of the data and are not unique: any smaller $c$ and
any larger $C$ serve as well.

### This is an equivalence relation on the norms on $V$

- **Reflexive:** take $c = C = 1$.
- **Symmetric:** from $cM \le N \le CM$ and $c, C > 0$ one gets
  $C^{-1}N \le M \le c^{-1}N$, dividing by the positive constants
  ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).
- **Transitive:** if $cM \le N \le CM$ and $c'N \le P \le C'N$ then
  $c'c\,M \le P \le C'C\,M$, and $c'c > 0$, $C'C > 0$, a product of positives
  being positive.

### The dictionary with equivalent metrics

Let $d_M(u,v) = M(u-v)$ and $d_N(u,v) = N(u-v)$ be the induced metrics
([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]). Substituting $v := u - w$ in the displayed
condition gives

$$c\,d_M(u,w) \;\le\; d_N(u,w) \;\le\; C\,d_M(u,w) \qquad \text{for all } u, w \in V ,$$

which is **verbatim the Lipschitz equivalence** of $d_M$ and $d_N$ in the sense
of [[def-equivalent-metrics]], with $\alpha = c$ and $\beta = C$. That is the
**strongest** of the three tiers that item distinguishes: by
[[thm-metric-equivalence-hierarchy]], Lipschitz equivalence implies uniform
equivalence, which implies topological equivalence. So equivalent norms give

- the same open sets, hence the same closed sets, closures and interiors
  ([[def-metric-topology]]);
- the same uniformly continuous maps into and out of $V$
  ([[def-metric-uniform-continuity]]);
- the same convergent sequences with the same limits, and the same Cauchy
  sequences ([[def-metric-convergence]], [[def-cauchy-in-metric]]).

The last line deserves its two-line verification, since it is used constantly
below and is not literally a clause of [[thm-metric-equivalence-hierarchy]]. If
$d_M(v_k, v) \to 0$ then $0 \le d_N(v_k,v) \le C\,d_M(v_k,v)$, so given a
rational $\varepsilon > 0$ an index beyond which $d_M(v_k,v) < \varepsilon/C$
serves for $d_N$; the converse uses $d_M \le c^{-1}d_N$ in the same way. The
Cauchy statement is the same estimate applied to $d_N(v_k,v_l)$. In particular
$(V, d_M)$ is complete if and only if $(V,d_N)$ is.

**Naming.** Many texts say *strongly equivalent* for what
[[def-equivalent-metrics]] calls Lipschitz equivalent, and simply *equivalent*
for what it calls topologically equivalent. As there, this library always writes
the qualifier for metrics. For **norms** there is no fork to guard against: the
condition displayed above is the only one anyone calls equivalence of norms, and
it is always the Lipschitz-strength one.

## Remarks

- **The converse of the dictionary fails.** A metric on $V$ that is equivalent to
  a norm metric need not itself come from a norm: [[lem-bounded-remetrisation]]
  turns any metric $d$ into $d' = \min\{d,1\}$, uniformly equivalent to $d$ and
  bounded, and a bounded metric on a nonzero vector space is not induced by any
  norm, since absolute homogeneity would make $d'(\lambda v, 0)$ unbounded in
  $\lambda$ ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]). So "equivalent to a norm metric" is
  strictly weaker than "induced by an equivalent norm".

- **Equivalence is a statement about a fixed vector space.** Two norms on
  different spaces are never compared. On $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with $n \ge 1$ the
  norms $\lVert\cdot\rVert_1$, $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ and
  $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ of [[def-p-norms-on-rn]] are equivalent, with
  explicit constants proved in
  [[lem-every-norm-on-rn-is-continuous-for-the-euclidean-metric]]; that every
  pair of norms on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is equivalent is
  [[thm-all-norms-on-rn-are-equivalent]]. Neither statement survives to spaces
  that are not finite-dimensional, and the companion page carries the witness.

- **Equivalence says nothing about the geometry.** Equivalent norms have the same
  convergent sequences and the same open sets; they may still have quite
  different unit balls, and one of them may come from an inner product while the
  other does not. [[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]]
  records the metric identifications and nothing more.

## Definition

Let $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ be metric spaces ([[def-metric-space]]).

**Isometric embedding and isometry.** A function $f : X \to Y$ is an
**isometric embedding** if

$$d_Y\big(f(x), f(x')\big) = d_X(x,x') \qquad \text{for all } x, x' \in X ,$$

and an **isometry** if it is in addition bijective
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]). Two metric spaces are **isometric** if
some isometry between them exists.

**Subspace metric.** Let $A \subseteq X$ and let

$$d_A := d_X \restriction (A \times A)$$

be the restriction of $d_X$ to pairs from $A$. Then $d_A$ is a metric on $A$:
the three axioms (M1), (M2), (M3) of [[def-metric-space]] are conditions on
triples of points, and each holds for points of $A$ because it holds for points
of $X$. The pair $(A, d_A)$ is the **metric subspace** $A$ of $X$, and the
inclusion $A \to X$ is an isometric embedding by construction. The metric
topology of $d_A$ ([[def-metric-topology]]) is the **subspace topology** of $A$.

**Balls of a subspace are traces of balls of the ambient space.** For $a \in A$
and $r > 0$,

$$B_A(a,r) = B_X(a,r) \cap A ,$$

directly from the definitions: a point $z$ lies in the left side exactly when
$z \in A$ and $d_A(a,z) = d_X(a,z) < r$ ([[def-metric-ball]]). This is why the
ambient space is always written into the ball notation, and it is the source of
every apparent paradox about balls in subspaces.

## Remarks

- **An isometric embedding is automatically injective**, and it identifies $X$
  with the subspace $f[X]$ of $Y$, topology and all; that is
  [[lem-isometry-is-an-embedding]]. The word *embedding* is therefore justified
  rather than merely suggestive.
- **A bijective isometric embedding has an isometric inverse.** If $f$ is an
  isometry then $f^{-1}$ satisfies
  $d_X(f^{-1}(y), f^{-1}(y')) = d_Y(y,y')$, because writing $y = f(x)$ and
  $y' = f(x')$ turns that into the defining identity of $f$. So "isometric" is a
  symmetric relation between metric spaces, and it is transitive because a
  composite of isometries is one.
- **Isometry is much finer than having the same topology.** Isometric spaces are
  homeomorphic, but $\mathbb{R}$ with $d(x,y) = |x-y|$ and $\mathbb{R}$ with
  $\min\{|x-y|, 1\}$ have the same topology and are not isometric, the second
  being bounded and the first not
  ([[lem-bounded-remetrisation]], [[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]).

## Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]), let $x \in X$ and let
$r \in \mathbb{R}$ with $r > 0$ ([[def-real-order]]). Define

$$B(x,r) := \{\, y \in X : d(x,y) < r \,\}, \qquad \bar B(x,r) := \{\, y \in X : d(x,y) \le r \,\}, \qquad S(x,r) := \{\, y \in X : d(x,y) = r \,\}.$$

$B(x,r)$ is the **open ball**, $\bar B(x,r)$ the **closed ball** and $S(x,r)$ the
**sphere** of **centre** $x$ and **radius** $r$. The radius is always a strictly
positive real; a ball of radius $0$ or of negative radius is never written in
this library.

**Immediate consequences of the definitions.** For every $x \in X$ and $r > 0$:

- $x \in B(x,r)$, because $d(x,x) = 0 < r$ (axiom (M1) of [[def-metric-space]]);
  in particular open and closed balls are nonempty.
- $B(x,r) \subseteq \bar B(x,r)$ and $S(x,r) \subseteq \bar B(x,r)$, and
  $\bar B(x,r)$ is the disjoint union of $B(x,r)$ and $S(x,r)$, by trichotomy of
  the order of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]):
  each $y$ satisfies exactly one of $d(x,y) < r$, $d(x,y) = r$, $d(x,y) > r$.
- If $0 < s \le r$ then $B(x,s) \subseteq B(x,r)$ and
  $\bar B(x,s) \subseteq \bar B(x,r)$, by transitivity of the order.
- Nonnegativity of the metric ([[lem-metric-nonnegativity]]) is what forces the
  radius convention, and it forces it for the **open** ball only: if $r \le 0$
  then $B(x,r) = \{y : d(x,y) < r\}$ is empty, because $d(x,y) \ge 0 \ge r$
  for every $y$. The other two sets behave differently at $r = 0$, and the
  convention $r > 0$ excludes them for uniformity rather than for emptiness:
  $\bar B(x,0) = S(x,0) = \{x\}$, since $d(x,y) \le 0$ together with
  $d(x,y) \ge 0$ gives $d(x,y) = 0$ and hence $y = x$ by (M1). For $r < 0$ all
  three sets are empty.

**A sphere may be empty, and so the three sets are not on a par.** For $r > 0$
the open and closed balls always contain $x$, but nothing in the definition
produces a point at distance exactly $r$ from $x$. If a metric takes only the
values $0$ and $1$, as the discrete metric on the companion page does, then
$S(x,2) = \emptyset$ while $B(x,2) = \bar B(x,2)$ is the whole space. So
nonemptiness of a sphere is never available by convention: where it is used, it
is proved.

**The ambient space is part of the notation.** $B(x,r)$ depends on $(X,d)$ and
not on $x$ and $r$ alone. When more than one space or more than one metric is in
play we write $B_X(x,r)$, or $B_d(x,r)$, and likewise for $\bar B$ and $S$. This
matters as soon as subspaces appear ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]): a
ball of a subspace is the trace on it of a ball of the ambient space, and the two
are different sets.

## Remarks

- **The names "open ball" and "closed ball" are justified, not merely
  suggestive.** That $B(x,r)$ is an open set and $\bar B(x,r)$ a closed set in
  the metric topology is proved in [[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]]; the words are
  used here only as names for the three sets displayed above.
- **The closed ball is not in general the closure of the open ball**, and the
  sphere is not in general the boundary of either. Both failures are recorded on
  this page as [[fs-closed-ball-is-the-closure-of-the-open-ball]] and witnessed
  on the companion page. The safe reading of the three names is the displayed
  one and nothing more.

## Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]) and let
$A, B \subseteq X$.

**Bounded subset.** $A$ is **bounded** if $A = \emptyset$ or there are $x_0 \in X$
and a real $r > 0$ with $A \subseteq B(x_0, r)$ ([[def-metric-ball]]). The space
$(X,d)$ is a **bounded metric space** if $X$ is a bounded subset of itself.

**Diameter, for nonempty bounded $A$ only.** Suppose $A$ is nonempty and
bounded, and put

$$D(A) := \{\, d(a,b) : a, b \in A \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}.$$

Then $D(A)$ is nonempty, since $A$ is, and it is bounded above: fixing $x_0$ and
$r$ with $A \subseteq B(x_0,r)$, every $a, b \in A$ satisfy
$d(a,b) \le d(a,x_0) + d(x_0,b) < r + r$ by the triangle inequality, symmetry
([[def-metric-space]]) and addition of inequalities ([[lem-of-add-order]],
[[def-ordered-field]]), so $r + r$ is an upper bound of $D(A)$
([[def-bounded-set]]). Hence $D(A)$ has a least upper bound in $\mathbb{R}$ by
the least-upper-bound property ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), and that bound
is unique ([[lem-sup-unique]]). Define

$$\operatorname{diam}(A) := \sup D(A).$$

**Distance from a point to a set, for nonempty $A$ only.** Let $x \in X$ and let
$A$ be nonempty, and put $E(x,A) := \{\, d(x,a) : a \in A \,\}$. Then $E(x,A)$ is
nonempty and bounded below by $0$, since a metric is nonnegative
([[lem-metric-nonnegativity]], [[def-bounded-set]]), so it has a greatest lower
bound ([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]), unique by [[lem-sup-unique]].
Define

$$d(x,A) := \inf E(x,A).$$

**Distance between two sets, for nonempty $A$ and $B$ only.** Put
$E(A,B) := \{\, d(a,b) : a \in A,\ b \in B \,\}$, again nonempty and bounded
below by $0$, and define

$$d(A,B) := \inf E(A,B).$$

**Every one of the three scope restrictions is load bearing.** In this library
$\sup$ and $\inf$ denote real numbers and are written only after existence has
been established; the extended real line is introduced on a later page and is
not used for the suprema and infima taken here, and no convention
$\sup \emptyset = -\infty$ is in force in this development
([[rem-sup-conventions]]). Accordingly:

- $\operatorname{diam}(A)$ is defined exactly when $A$ is nonempty **and**
  bounded. It is not defined for $A = \emptyset$, and it is not defined, not even
  as an infinite value, for an unbounded $A$.
- $d(x,A)$ is defined exactly when $A \ne \emptyset$, and $d(A,B)$ exactly when
  both $A$ and $B$ are nonempty. No boundedness is needed for these two, because
  $0$ is always a lower bound.

## Remarks

- **Diameter and the distance functions are nonnegative.** For nonempty bounded
  $A$ and any $a \in A$ we have $0 = d(a,a) \in D(A)$, so
  $\operatorname{diam}(A) \ge 0$; and $d(x,A) \ge 0$, $d(A,B) \ge 0$ because $0$
  is a lower bound of the sets they are infima of
  ([[lem-metric-nonnegativity]], [[def-infimum]]).
- **$d(A,B)$ is not a metric on the nonempty subsets of $X$.** It is symmetric
  and vanishes on $A = B$, but two distinct disjoint sets can be at distance $0$,
  so the separation axiom (M1) of [[def-metric-space]] fails; the witness is on
  the companion page. The letter $d$ is reused for three different functions
  here, the metric, the point-to-set distance and the set-to-set distance, only
  because the arguments make the intended one unambiguous.
- **$d(x,A)$ is the special case $d(\{x\},A)$**, since
  $E(\{x\},A) = E(x,A)$, and the two infima therefore agree by uniqueness
  ([[lem-sup-unique]]).

## Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]), with open sets as in
[[def-metric-topology]] and balls as in [[def-metric-ball]].

- An **open cover** of $(X,d)$ is a family $\mathcal{U}$ of open subsets of $X$
  with $X = \bigcup \mathcal{U}$, where
  $\bigcup \mathcal{U} = \{\, x \in X : x \in U \text{ for some } U \in \mathcal{U} \,\}$.
- A **subcover** of $\mathcal{U}$ is a subfamily
  $\mathcal{V} \subseteq \mathcal{U}$ that is itself an open cover.
- A family $\mathcal{V}$ of sets is **finite** when $\mathcal{V} = \emptyset$ or
  there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and sets $V_0, \dots, V_n$ with
  $\mathcal{V} = \{V_0, \dots, V_n\}$; repetitions in the list are allowed and
  harmless.
- $(X,d)$ is **compact** when every open cover of it has a finite subcover: for
  every open cover $\mathcal{U}$, either $X = \emptyset$ and the empty subfamily
  covers it, or there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
  $U_0, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{U}$ with
  $$X = U_0 \cup \dots \cup U_n .$$
- A subset $A \subseteq X$ is a **compact subset** of $X$ when the metric
  subspace $(A, d_A)$ is a compact metric space, $d_A$ being the restriction of
  $d$ to $A \times A$ ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]).

**Compactness of a subset is defined intrinsically, and only intrinsically.**
The last clause speaks about the subspace $(A,d_A)$ and its own open sets, not
about families of open subsets of the ambient $X$. The two readings do agree,
but that is a theorem and not a convention: it is
[[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]], and no item of this library may use the
ambient reading without citing it. Taking the intrinsic reading as the
definition is what makes "compact" a property of the metric space $(A,d_A)$
alone, so that a set compact in one ambient space is compact in every other one
containing it isometrically.

**The empty space is compact**, since the empty subfamily of any family covers
it; this is the reason the clause above is written with the two cases. The
one-point space is compact too, and so is every space listed as
$\{x_0, \dots, x_n\}$: given a cover, each $x_i$ lies in some member, and
finitely many members chosen in this way already cover.

**The finiteness convention, and how it is used both ways.** "Finite" above is
the listing form, matching the finite lists of
[[def-finite-intersection-property]]. It agrees with the definition of
finiteness by equinumerosity with a natural number ([[def-countable]]), and
both directions of the agreement are available and are used below:

- A nonempty finite set $F$ in the sense of [[def-countable]] satisfies
  $F \approx m$ for some $m \ge 1$, and a bijection $m \to F$ is exactly a
  listing $F = \{a_0, \dots, a_{m-1}\}$.
- Conversely a set listed as $A = \{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$, that is the image of a
  function $a$ with domain $\sigma(n)$, is finite in the sense of
  [[def-countable]]: the map sending $x \in A$ to the least $i \le n$ with
  $a_i = x$ is an injection of $A$ into $\sigma(n)$, so $A$ is equinumerous with
  a subset of $\mathbb{N}$ bounded above, and such a subset is finite
  ([[lem-subset-of-countable]]).

Neither direction uses a choice principle: the second selects nothing, taking a
least index instead.

## Remarks

**Why open covers rather than closed ones.** Nothing in the definition would
break if $\mathcal{U}$ were allowed to consist of arbitrary sets, but the
resulting notion would be uninteresting: every space is covered by its
singletons, and only a finite space would survive. Openness of the members is
what makes the condition a genuine restriction, and it is what
[[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]] has to keep track of when the ambient space
changes.

**A warning about the word "cover".** A family may cover $A \subseteq X$ without
being a family of subsets of $A$: the members are open subsets of $X$ and their
union merely contains $A$. That is the ambient reading, and it is a different
statement from "$\mathcal{U}$ is an open cover of the metric space $(A,d_A)$",
whose members are open subsets of $A$. Which of the two is meant is written out
everywhere on this page.

## Definition

Let $(X, d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$ be metric spaces ([[def-metric-space]]), let
$f : X \to Y$ be a function and let $a \in X$.

$f$ is **continuous at $a$** if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ such that

$$d_X(x,a) < \delta \;\Longrightarrow\; d_Y\big(f(x), f(a)\big) < \varepsilon \qquad \text{for all } x \in X .$$

$f$ is **continuous** (globally, or on $X$) if it is continuous at every point of
$X$.

**The same condition in balls.** Since $d_X(x,a) < \delta$ says $x \in B_X(a,\delta)$
and $d_Y(f(x),f(a)) < \varepsilon$ says $f(x) \in B_Y(f(a),\varepsilon)$
([[def-metric-ball]]), continuity at $a$ reads: for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there
is $\delta > 0$ with

$$f\big[B_X(a,\delta)\big] \subseteq B_Y\big(f(a), \varepsilon\big).$$

Both forms are used below and are the same statement written twice.

**Both metrics matter, and both are named.** Continuity is a property of the
triple $(d_X, d_Y, f)$, not of $f$ alone. When several metrics on the same
underlying sets are in play, as in [[def-equivalent-metrics]], the metrics are
always written out.

**Quantifier order.** The $\delta$ is allowed to depend on $\varepsilon$ **and on
the point $a$**. Requiring one $\delta$ to work at every point simultaneously is
a strictly stronger condition, uniform continuity; it is defined on a later page
of this library, and at this point in the reading order it is written out in full
where needed ([[def-equivalent-metrics]]).

## Remarks

- **Nothing is claimed here beyond the definition.** That continuity is
  equivalent to preimages of open sets being open, to preimages of closed sets
  being closed, to sequential continuity, and to
  $f[\overline{A}] \subseteq \overline{f[A]}$, is the theorem
  [[thm-metric-continuity-characterisations]].
- **Continuity at a point is a local condition**: it depends only on the values
  of $f$ on any one ball around $a$, since the condition may always be tested
  with a smaller $\delta$.
- Every isometric embedding is continuous, with $\delta = \varepsilon$
  ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]], [[lem-isometry-is-an-embedding]]), and
  so is every map that does not increase distances, such as $u \mapsto d(u,A)$
  ([[lem-distance-to-set-is-lipschitz]]).

## Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]).

A subset $U \subseteq X$ is **open in $(X,d)$** if for every $x \in U$ there is a
real $r > 0$ with $B(x,r) \subseteq U$ ([[def-metric-ball]]). A subset
$F \subseteq X$ is **closed in $(X,d)$** if its complement $X \setminus F$ is
open.

The collection

$$\mathcal{T}_d := \{\, U \subseteq X : U \text{ is open in } (X,d) \,\}$$

of all open subsets is the **metric topology** of $d$ on $X$. A subset of $X$
that is both open and closed is called **clopen**.

**Two sets are open for trivial reasons.** $\emptyset$ is open, because the
defining condition quantifies over no points; and $X$ is open, because
$B(x,r) \subseteq X$ for every $x$ and every $r > 0$. Consequently $X$ and
$\emptyset$ are also closed, and both are clopen.

**A neighbourhood of a point $x$** is any open set containing $x$. The condition
above therefore reads: $U$ is open exactly when every point of $U$ has a ball
around it inside $U$, and it is the balls alone that have to be tested.

**The metric, not the set, determines $\mathcal{T}_d$.** Two metrics on the same
set may have different metric topologies, and two different metrics may have the
same one; the systematic comparison is [[def-equivalent-metrics]].

## Remarks

- **What "topology" means here.** $\mathcal{T}_d$ is defined above as a
  collection of subsets of $X$; the abstract notion of a topological space, a
  collection of subsets closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections
  taken as primitive data, is introduced on a later page and is not used
  here. What is proved
  here is that $\mathcal{T}_d$ has exactly those closure properties
  ([[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]]), which is what licenses the word.
- **Open and closed are not opposites.** A set may be neither ($[0,1)$ inside
  $\mathbb{R}$, once the usual metric is available from
  [[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]) or both ($\emptyset$ and $X$ always, and
  in some spaces every subset at once, as the discrete metric on the companion
  page shows). "Not open" is never a synonym for "closed".
- **Closedness is complementation, and nothing else, at this stage.** The
  description of closed sets by limits of sequences, and the description of the
  closure as an infimum of distances, are theorems proved later on this page
  ([[thm-metric-closure-characterisation]], [[thm-metric-sequential-closure]]),
  not part of the definition.

## Definition

Throughout this page $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) constructed in this library, in particular a
field, so that "vector space" below always means vector space over $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-vector-space]]).

Let $V$ be a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$, with zero vector $0_V$. A **norm on
$V$** is a function $N : V \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $u, v \in V$ and all
$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$:

- **(N1) Separation.** $N(v) = 0$ if and only if $v = 0_V$.
- **(N2) Absolute homogeneity.** $N(\lambda v) = |\lambda|\,N(v)$, the absolute
  value being that of [[def-abs-value]].
- **(N3) Triangle inequality.** $N(u + v) \le N(u) + N(v)$.

A **normed space** is a pair $(V, N)$ consisting of a vector space $V$ over
$\mathbb{R}$ and a norm $N$ on it. When only one norm is in play we write
$\lVert v\rVert$ for $N(v)$; when several are, the norm is always named.

**The values of a norm are real numbers.** The codomain is $\mathbb{R}$, so
$N(v)$ is an honest element of the complete ordered field and no infinite value
is permitted. This is the same convention [[rem-metric-axiom-conventions]]
records for metrics.

### Nonnegativity is a theorem, not an axiom

Many texts add a fourth condition $N(v) \ge 0$. It is redundant. Applying (N2)
with $\lambda = -1$ gives $N(-v) = |-1|\,N(v) = N(v)$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]],
[[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]] for $(-1)v = -v$), and then (N3)
with $u = v$ and $-v$ gives

$$0 \;=\; N(0_V) \;=\; N\bigl(v + (-v)\bigr) \;\le\; N(v) + N(-v) \;=\; N(v) + N(v),$$

where $N(0_V) = 0$ is (N1). So $N(v) + N(v) \ge 0$, and if $N(v) < 0$ then
$N(v) + N(v) < 0$ by addition of inequalities, which trichotomy forbids
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]). Hence $N(v) \ge 0$ for every $v \in V$.

**Consequently the verification of a candidate norm has three things to check and
not four**, exactly as the verification of a candidate metric has three and not
four ([[def-metric-space]], [[lem-metric-nonnegativity]]). No item in this
library assumes nonnegativity of a norm before the argument above.

### The induced metric

Let $N$ be a norm on $V$ and define

$$d_N(u,v) \;:=\; N(u - v) \qquad (u, v \in V),$$

where $u - v = u + (-v)$ ([[def-vector-space]]). **Then $d_N$ is a metric on
$V$** ([[def-metric-space]]), and the three axioms are the three conditions
above, in order:

- **(M1)** $d_N(u,v) = 0$ means $N(u-v) = 0$, which by (N1) says $u - v = 0_V$,
  that is $u = v$; and conversely $d_N(v,v) = N(0_V) = 0$.
- **(M2)** $d_N(v,u) = N(v-u) = N\bigl((-1)(u-v)\bigr) = |-1|\,N(u-v) = d_N(u,v)$,
  by (N2), [[lem-of-abs-value]] and $(-1)w = -w$
  ([[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]]).
- **(M3)** $d_N(u,w) = N\bigl((u-v) + (v-w)\bigr) \le N(u-v) + N(v-w) = d_N(u,v) + d_N(v,w)$,
  by (N3).

A normed space is therefore a metric space, and every notion defined for metric
spaces — open set ([[def-metric-topology]]), convergence, Cauchyness,
continuity, compactness — is available in it with no further definition. **This
library never introduces a second notion of any of them for normed spaces.**

### Two properties an arbitrary metric need not have

The metric $d_N$ satisfies, for all $u, v, w \in V$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$:

- **translation invariance**, $d_N(u + w, v + w) = N\bigl((u+w)-(v+w)\bigr) = N(u-v) = d_N(u,v)$;
- **absolute homogeneity**, $d_N(\lambda u, \lambda v) = N\bigl(\lambda(u-v)\bigr) = |\lambda|\,d_N(u,v)$, by (N2).

**Not every metric on a vector space arises from a norm**, and homogeneity is
what fails. The published bounded remetrisation [[lem-bounded-remetrisation]]
replaces a metric $d$ by $d' = \min\{d, 1\}$, a metric with the same topology
whose values never exceed $1$; on a vector space $V$ containing a vector $v$ with
$d(v, 0_V) > 0$ this $d'$ cannot be $d_M$ for any norm $M$, since absolute
homogeneity would force $d'(\lambda v, 0_V) = |\lambda|\,d'(v, 0_V)$, which is
unbounded in $\lambda$, while $d'$ is bounded by $1$. So the passage from norms
to metrics is not reversible, and a statement about a metric on a vector space is
strictly weaker than the corresponding statement about a norm.

## Remarks

- **Why (N1) is stated as an equivalence.** The direction $N(0_V) = 0$ is forced
  by (N2) with $\lambda = 0$, since $0\,v = 0_V$
  ([[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]]) gives $N(0_V) = |0|\,N(v) = 0$.
  Only the direction "$N(v) = 0$ implies $v = 0_V$" is a genuine assumption, and
  dropping it gives what is usually called a seminorm, a notion this library does
  not use. The situation is exactly the one [[rem-metric-axiom-conventions]]
  describes for (M1) and the pseudometric.

- **The zero space carries exactly one norm.** If $V = \{0_V\}$ then the only
  function $V \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying (N1) is the one with value $0$, and it
  satisfies (N2) and (N3) trivially. In particular $\mathbb{R}^{0}$, the function
  space on the empty index set ([[def-function-space]]), is a normed space,
  although the metrics of the published metric theory on $\mathbb{R}^n$ are
  defined only for $n \ge 1$.

- **What is not defined here.** This item does not define linear maps; their
  published definition is [[def-linear-map]]. It also does not define operator
  norms, dual spaces, or abstract inner product spaces.
  [[rem-rn-conventions-and-scope]] records the remaining scope boundaries and
  what each later development would license.

## Definition

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be the function space of
[[def-euclidean-inner-product]], with $x_k := x(k)$ for $k < n$.

### The $p$-norm, for a rational exponent $p \ge 1$

Let $p \in \mathbb{Q}$ with $p \ge 1$. For $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ put

$$\lVert x\rVert_p \;:=\; \Bigl(\sum_{k<n} |x_k|^{p}\Bigr)^{1/p},$$

where $|\cdot|$ is the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]), the sum is the finite
sum of [[def-finite-sum]], and both powers are the **rational** powers of
[[def-rational-power]].

**Every power written here is defined.** Each base $|x_k|$ is a nonnegative real
and $p > 0$, so $|x_k|^{p}$ is given by [[def-rational-power]] for $|x_k| > 0$
and by its supplementary clause $0^{p} = 0$ for $|x_k| = 0$; the sum of these
nonnegative terms is nonnegative ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 4), and
$1/p$ is a positive rational, so the outer power is defined for the same two
reasons. The value does not depend on which representative of $p$ or of $1/p$ is
used ([[lem-rational-power-well-defined]]).

**The exponent is a rational, and that is not a matter of taste.**
[[def-rational-power]] supplies $a^{r}$ for a nonnegative base and a **rational**
exponent only; real exponents do not exist at this point in the reading order,
and [[rem-real-exponents-deferred]] records exactly why. This is also why the
published Minkowski inequality [[thm-minkowski-finite]], which is what makes the
triangle inequality work below, is itself stated for rational $p \ge 1$. **No
statement on this page is written for $p$ ranging over a real interval.**

### The maximum norm

For $n \ge 1$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ put

$$\lVert x\rVert_\infty \;:=\; \max\{\, |x_k| \;:\; k < n \,\},$$

the maximum of a nonempty finite set of reals, which exists and is one of its
elements ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

**The hypothesis $n \ge 1$ is required and propagates.** At $n = 0$ the set
$\{|x_k| : k<n\}$ is empty and has no maximum ([[def-max-min]]). This is the same
restriction the published [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] carries, for the same reason, and
**every statement on this page that mentions $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ inherits
it**. The $p$-norms for rational $p \ge 1$ carry no such restriction: at $n = 0$
each is the empty sum raised to a positive rational power, hence $0$.

### The three cases the rest of the page uses

- $\lVert x\rVert_1 = \sum_{k<n}|x_k|$, since $t^{1} = t$ for $t \ge 0$
  ([[lem-rational-power-laws]], and $0^{1} = 0$ by the supplementary clause).
- $\lVert x\rVert_2 = \bigl(\sum_{k<n}|x_k|^{2}\bigr)^{1/2} = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}x_k^{2}}$,
  which is exactly the Euclidean norm of [[def-euclidean-inner-product]]: the
  exponent $2$ agrees with the integer power, so $|x_k|^{2} = x_k^{2}$
  ([[lem-of-abs-value]]), and $t^{1/2}$ is the unique nonnegative square root of
  $t$, which is $\sqrt{t}$ ([[def-rational-power]], [[thm-of-square-roots]]).
  **The two notations denote the same function and no second Euclidean norm is
  introduced.**
- $\lVert x\rVert_\infty$ as above, for $n \ge 1$.

That each of these is a norm in the sense of [[def-norm-and-normed-space]], and
that the metrics they induce are exactly the published $d_1$, $d_2$ and
$d_\infty$ of [[lem-metrics-on-rn]], is
[[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]]; it is proved there
and is not assumed here.

## Remarks

- **Why $p \ge 1$.** The triangle inequality for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$ is
  Minkowski's inequality, and [[thm-minkowski-finite]] is stated for rational
  $p \ge 1$. For $0 < p < 1$ the displayed expression is still defined but is not
  a norm on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n \ge 2$; nothing on this page asserts anything
  about that range, and the expression is never written with such an exponent.

- **Monotonicity in the base is what makes the comparisons below work.** For a
  fixed positive rational $r$ the map $a \mapsto a^{r}$ is strictly increasing on
  the positive reals ([[lem-rational-power-monotone]] clause 2), so an inequality
  between nonnegative sums passes through the outer power. That is the only
  property of rational powers used in the comparison chain of
  [[lem-every-norm-on-rn-is-continuous-for-the-euclidean-metric]].

- **The subscript $\infty$ is a name, not a number.** No arithmetic is performed
  with it, and $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ is not $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$ for any
  exponent; it is a separately defined function that happens to sit at the end of
  the family. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$ silently that
  [[def-interval]] records for the interval notation.

## Statement

**Clause 1 is about an arbitrary norm; clauses 2 to 4 are about
$\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with $n \ge 1$.**

1. **Finite and reverse triangle inequalities.** Let $V$ be a vector space over
   $\mathbb{R}$ and $N$ a norm on it ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]). For every
   $p \in \mathbb{N}$ and every list $u : p \to V$
   ([[def-linear-combination-and-span]]),
   $$N\Bigl(\sum_{j<p} u_j\Bigr) \;\le\; \sum_{j<p} N(u_j),$$
   and for all $u, w \in V$,
   $$\bigl|N(u) - N(w)\bigr| \;\le\; N(u - w).$$

Now let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, let $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ carry the norms of
[[def-p-norms-on-rn]] and write $\iota$ for the canonical natural
([[def-canonical-natural]]).

2. **Every norm is dominated by the $1$-norm.** Let $N$ be a norm on
   $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and put $C := \max\{\, N(e_k) : k<n \,\}$, a maximum over a
   nonempty finite set of reals ([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]],
   [[lem-finite-set-has-max]]). Then $C \ge 0$ and
   $$N(x) \;\le\; C\,\lVert x\rVert_1 \qquad \text{for every } x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}.$$
3. **The comparison chain.** For every $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$,
   $$\lVert x\rVert_\infty \;\le\; \lVert x\rVert_2 \;\le\; \lVert x\rVert_1 \;\le\; \iota(n)\,\lVert x\rVert_\infty , \qquad \lVert x\rVert_1 \;\le\; \sqrt{\iota(n)}\;\lVert x\rVert_2 .$$
   In particular $\lVert\cdot\rVert_1$, $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ and
   $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ are pairwise equivalent norms on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$,
   with the constants displayed ([[def-equivalent-norms]]).
4. **Every norm is Lipschitz for the Euclidean metric.** With $N$ and $C$ as in
   clause 2, $N : (\mathbb{R}^{n}, d_2) \to (\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$ is
   Lipschitz with constant $C\sqrt{\iota(n)}$
   ([[def-lipschitz-holder-contraction]], [[lem-metrics-on-rn]],
   [[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]), hence uniformly continuous and
   continuous ([[thm-metric-regularity-hierarchy]], [[def-metric-continuity]]).

**Where $n \ge 1$ enters.** Clauses 2 and 4 need the maximum defining $C$ to
exist, and clause 3 mentions $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$; at $n = 0$ each is a
maximum over the empty index set and does not exist, exactly as in
[[lem-metrics-on-rn]] and [[def-p-norms-on-rn]]. Clause 1 carries no hypothesis
on the dimension and no hypothesis on the space.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A vector space $V$ over $\mathbb{R}$ with a norm $N$ ([[def-vector-space]], [[def-norm-and-normed-space]]); and, for clauses 2 to 4, a natural $n \ge 1$, the space $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, a norm $N$ on it, and vectors $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$.

[L1] The norm axioms: $N(v) = 0$ exactly when $v = 0_V$; $N(\lambda v) = |\lambda|N(v)$; $N(u+w) \le N(u)+N(w)$; and $N(v) \ge 0$ ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]).

[L2] Finite sums in a vector space: $\sum_{j<0}u_j = 0_V$ and $\sum_{j<p+1}u_j = \bigl(\sum_{j<p}u_j\bigr) + u_p$ ([[def-linear-combination-and-span]]); and $(-1)v = -v$ ([[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]]).

[L3] The induction principle ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L4] Laws of finite sums of reals ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[def-finite-sum]]): additivity, scaling, monotonicity, $\sum_{k<n}\lambda = \iota(n)\lambda$, a sum of nonnegative terms is nonnegative, and every single term is at most such a sum.

[L5] The standard basis: $e_i \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ has $e_i(i) = 1$ and $e_i(j) = 0$ for $j \ne i$, $e$ is an ordered basis of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and every $x$ satisfies $x = \sum_{i<n}x_i e_i$ with coordinate list $i \mapsto x(i)$ ([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]] clauses 1 to 3, [[thm-unique-coordinates-with-respect-to-an-ordered-basis]]).

[L6] Maxima ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]): a nonempty finite set of reals has a maximum, which belongs to the set and bounds it above.

[L7] The three norms ([[def-p-norms-on-rn]], [[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]]): $\lVert x\rVert_1 = \sum_{k<n}|x_k|$, $\lVert x\rVert_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}x_k^{2}}$, $\lVert x\rVert_\infty = \max\{|x_k| : k<n\}$, and each induces the correspondingly named published metric.

[L8] Cauchy-Schwarz in root form ([[thm-cauchy-schwarz-finite]]): $\bigl|\sum_{k<n}a_kb_k\bigr| \le \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}a_k^{2}}\sqrt{\sum_{k<n}b_k^{2}}$.

[L9] Square roots and squaring ([[thm-of-square-roots]], [[lem-of-square-monotone]]): every $c \ge 0$ has a unique $\sqrt{c} \ge 0$ with $(\sqrt{c})^{2} = c$; for $a,b \ge 0$, $a \le b$ exactly when $a^{2} \le b^{2}$.

[L10] Absolute value ([[lem-of-abs-value]]): $|t| \ge 0$, $|t|^{2} = t^{2}$, $|st| = |s||t|$, $|-t| = |t|$, and $|t|$ equals $t$ or $-t$.

[L11] The canonical natural: $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L12] Lipschitz maps and the regularity hierarchy ([[def-lipschitz-holder-contraction]], [[thm-metric-regularity-hierarchy]], [[def-metric-continuity]]): a map with $d_Y(f(x),f(y)) \le L\,d_X(x,y)$ and $L \ge 0$ is Lipschitz, hence uniformly continuous, hence continuous; $d_{\mathbb{R}}(s,t) = |s-t|$ ([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The finite triangle inequality holds by induction on $p$: at $p = 0$ both sides are $0$, since $\sum_{j<0}u_j = 0_V$ and $N(0_V) = 0$ and the empty real sum is $0$; and if $N(\sum_{j<p}u_j) \le \sum_{j<p}N(u_j)$, then $N(\sum_{j<p+1}u_j) = N(\sum_{j<p}u_j + u_p) \le N(\sum_{j<p}u_j) + N(u_p) \le \sum_{j<p}N(u_j) + N(u_p) = \sum_{j<p+1}N(u_j)$. [L1, L2, L3, L4]

1.2 For $u, w \in V$: $N(u) = N((u-w)+w) \le N(u-w) + N(w)$, so $N(u)-N(w) \le N(u-w)$; and $N(w-u) = N((-1)(u-w)) = |-1|N(u-w) = N(u-w)$, so the same argument with $u$ and $w$ exchanged gives $N(w)-N(u) \le N(u-w)$. Since $|N(u)-N(w)|$ is one of $N(u)-N(w)$ and $N(w)-N(u)$, the reverse triangle inequality follows, completing clause 1. [L1, L2, L10]

1.3 For every $j<n$: $x_j^{2} \le \sum_{k<n}x_k^{2}$, since every single term of a sum of nonnegative terms is at most the sum; taking nonnegative square roots and using $|x_j|^{2} = x_j^{2}$ gives $|x_j| \le \lVert x\rVert_2$. [L4, L7, L9, L10]

1.4 For every $j<n$: $|x_j| \le \sum_{k<n}|x_k| = \lVert x\rVert_1$, again because a single term is at most the sum. [L4, L7, L10]

1.5 $\sum_{k<n}|x_k| \le \sum_{k<n}\lVert x\rVert_\infty = \iota(n)\lVert x\rVert_\infty$, since $|x_k| \le \lVert x\rVert_\infty$ for every $k<n$ and a constant list sums to $\iota(n)$ times its value; so $\lVert x\rVert_1 \le \iota(n)\lVert x\rVert_\infty$. [L4, L6, L7, L11]

1.6 Instantiating [L8] at $a_k := |x_k|$ and $b_k := 1$ gives $\lVert x\rVert_1 = \bigl|\sum_{k<n}|x_k|\cdot 1\bigr| \le \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}|x_k|^{2}}\,\sqrt{\sum_{k<n}1} = \lVert x\rVert_2\sqrt{\iota(n)}$. [L4, L7, L8, L10]

1.7 The set $\{N(e_k) : k<n\}$ is a nonempty finite set of reals because $n \ge 1$, so $C = \max\{N(e_k) : k<n\}$ exists, belongs to the set, satisfies $N(e_k) \le C$ for every $k<n$, and is $\ge 0$ since every value of $N$ is. [L1, L5, L6]

1.8 $x = \sum_{i<n} x_i e_i$, the coordinate list of $x$ with respect to the ordered basis $e$ being $i \mapsto x(i) = x_i$. [L5]

2.1 $\lVert x\rVert_\infty$ is one of the numbers $|x_j|$ with $j<n$, so step 1.3 gives $\lVert x\rVert_\infty \le \lVert x\rVert_2$. [step 1.3, L6, L7]

2.2 $\sum_{k<n}x_k^{2} = \sum_{k<n}|x_k|\,|x_k| \le \sum_{k<n}|x_k|\,\lVert x\rVert_1 = \lVert x\rVert_1\sum_{k<n}|x_k| = \lVert x\rVert_1^{2}$, using step 1.4 termwise, monotonicity and scaling; taking nonnegative square roots gives $\lVert x\rVert_2 \le \lVert x\rVert_1$. [step 1.4, L4, L7, L9, L10]

2.3 Applying step 1.1 to the list $i \mapsto x_i e_i$ and then (N2): $N(x) = N\bigl(\sum_{i<n}x_ie_i\bigr) \le \sum_{i<n}N(x_ie_i) = \sum_{i<n}|x_i|\,N(e_i) \le \sum_{i<n}|x_i|\,C = C\lVert x\rVert_1$, the last inequality by monotonicity from step 1.7. This is clause 2. [step 1.1, step 1.7, step 1.8, L1, L4, L7]

3.1 Steps 2.1, 2.2, 1.5 and 1.6 are the four inequalities of clause 3; since $\iota(n) > 0$ and $\sqrt{\iota(n)} > 0$, they exhibit positive constants in both directions for each of the three pairs, so the three norms are pairwise equivalent. [step 1.5, step 1.6, step 2.1, step 2.2, L11, L9]

3.2 By step 1.2 applied on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, then step 2.3, then step 1.6: $\bigl|N(x)-N(y)\bigr| \le N(x-y) \le C\lVert x-y\rVert_1 \le C\sqrt{\iota(n)}\;\lVert x-y\rVert_2$. [step 1.2, step 1.6, step 2.3, L4]

4.1 Since $\lVert x-y\rVert_2 = d_2(x,y)$ and $\bigl|N(x)-N(y)\bigr| = d_{\mathbb{R}}(N(x),N(y))$, step 3.2 says exactly that $N$ is Lipschitz with the nonnegative constant $C\sqrt{\iota(n)}$, hence uniformly continuous and continuous; this is clause 4, and with steps 1.2, 2.3 and 3.1 all four clauses are proved. [step 1.2, step 2.3, step 3.1, step 3.2, L7, L12] ∎

## Remarks

- **Clause 2 is the half of norm equivalence that costs no compactness.** It gives an upper bound for an arbitrary norm in terms of $\lVert\cdot\rVert_1$, and hence in terms of $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ by clause 3, by a computation with the standard basis alone. The matching **lower** bound is where compactness of the unit sphere enters, and that is [[thm-all-norms-on-rn-are-equivalent]].

- **The constants of clause 3 are best possible, and the companion page shows it.** Nothing here claims sharpness; the attaining vectors are exhibited on the companion page for $\mathbb{R}^{2}$.

- **Clause 1 is stated for a general norm on purpose.** It is used below for the Euclidean norm on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ inside [[thm-steinitz-polygonal-confinement]] and for an arbitrary $N$ in clause 2, and it is the only statement on this page that needs no hypothesis on the dimension at all.

## Statement

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$. A von Neumann natural is the set of its
predecessors, $n = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]), so it can be
used directly as an index set. Define

$$\mathbb{R}^n := \{\, x : x \text{ is a function } n \to \mathbb{R} \,\},$$

and write $x_k$ for $x(k)$, $k < n$. Two elements of $\mathbb{R}^n$ are equal
exactly when they agree at every $k < n$, functions being equal when they have
the same values. For $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ put

$$d_1(x,y) := \sum_{k<n} |x_k - y_k|, \qquad d_2(x,y) := \sqrt{\ \sum_{k<n} (x_k - y_k)^2\ }, \qquad d_\infty(x,y) := \max\{\, |x_k - y_k| : k < n \,\}.$$

All three are well defined: the finite sums are those of [[def-finite-sum]]; the
sum of squares is nonnegative ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[lem-of-square-positive]])
so it has a unique nonnegative square root ([[thm-of-square-roots]]); and
$\{|x_k - y_k| : k < n\}$ is a nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$, because
$n \ge 1$, so it has a maximum ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

**Then $d_1$, $d_2$ and $d_\infty$ are metrics on $\mathbb{R}^n$**
([[def-metric-space]]).

**Why $n \ge 1$.** For $n = 0$ the set $\mathbb{R}^0$ has exactly one element,
the empty function, and $d_1$ and $d_2$ are the empty sum $0$ and its root; but
$d_\infty$ would be the maximum of the empty set, which does not exist. The
hypothesis $n \ge 1$ is therefore not decoration, and it is carried by every
statement about $d_\infty$ in this library.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural $n \ge 1$; elements $x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}^n$; and the lists $a_k := x_k - y_k$, $b_k := y_k - z_k$ for $k < n$, so that $a_k + b_k = x_k - z_k$. Write $A := \sum_{k<n} a_k^2$, $C := \sum_{k<n} b_k^2$ and $B := \sum_{k<n} a_k b_k$.

[L1] Laws of finite sums ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[def-finite-sum]]): additivity, scaling, monotonicity; a sum of nonnegative terms is nonnegative, every single term is at most the sum, and a sum of nonnegative terms that vanishes has every term $0$.

[L2] Absolute value ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]]): $|u| \ge 0$; $|u| = 0$ if and only if $u = 0$; $|-u| = |u|$; and $u \le |u|$.

[L3] Two-term triangle inequality: $|u + v| \le |u| + |v|$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L4] Minkowski's inequality at the rational exponent $p = 1$ ([[thm-minkowski-finite]]): $\sum_{k<n}|a_k + b_k| \le \sum_{k<n}|a_k| + \sum_{k<n}|b_k|$.

[L5] Cauchy-Schwarz in root form ([[thm-cauchy-schwarz-finite]]): $\big|\sum_{k<n} a_k b_k\big| \le \sqrt{\sum_{k<n} a_k^2}\ \sqrt{\sum_{k<n} b_k^2}$.

[L6] Square roots ([[thm-of-square-roots]]): every $c \ge 0$ has a unique $\sqrt{c} \ge 0$ with $(\sqrt{c})^2 = c$; in particular $\sqrt{c} = 0$ if and only if $c = 0$.

[L7] Squares ([[lem-of-square-positive]], [[def-integer-power]]): $u^2 \ge 0$ always, and $u^2 = 0$ only for $u = 0$; and monotonicity of squaring on the nonnegatives, $s \le t \iff s^2 \le t^2$ for $s, t \ge 0$ ([[lem-of-square-monotone]]).

[L8] Maximum of a nonempty finite set of reals: it exists, it belongs to the set, and it is an upper bound of the set ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L9] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: inequalities may be added and a constant added to both sides, in the strict form of [[lem-of-add-order]] and, together with the case of equality settled by totality ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]), in the nonstrict form used below.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Separation for $d_1$: $d_1(x,y) = \sum_{k<n}|a_k|$ is a sum of nonnegative terms, so it vanishes exactly when every $|a_k|$ vanishes, that is exactly when $x_k = y_k$ for all $k < n$, that is exactly when $x = y$. [L1, L2]

1.2 Separation for $d_2$: $d_2(x,y) = \sqrt{A}$ vanishes exactly when $A = 0$; $A$ is a sum of nonnegative terms, so $A = 0$ exactly when $a_k^2 = 0$ for every $k < n$, which happens exactly when every $a_k = 0$, that is exactly when $x = y$. [L1, L6, L7]

1.3 Separation for $d_\infty$: the maximum $d_\infty(x,y)$ belongs to $\{|a_k| : k < n\}$ and bounds it above, so it is $0$ exactly when every $|a_k| = 0$, that is exactly when $x = y$. [L2, L8]

1.4 Symmetry for all three: $|y_k - x_k| = |-(x_k - y_k)| = |x_k - y_k|$ and $(y_k - x_k)^2 = (x_k - y_k)^2$ for every $k < n$, so the three defining expressions are unchanged when $x$ and $y$ are exchanged. [L2, L7]

1.5 Triangle inequality for $d_1$: applying [L4] to the lists $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ gives $d_1(x,z) = \sum_{k<n}|a_k + b_k| \le \sum_{k<n}|a_k| + \sum_{k<n}|b_k| = d_1(x,y) + d_1(y,z)$. [L4]

1.6 Expanding with additivity and scaling: $\sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k)^2 = \sum_{k<n}\big(a_k^2 + 2a_kb_k + b_k^2\big) = A + 2B + C$. [L1, algebra]

1.7 By [L5] and $B \le |B|$: $B \le \sqrt{A}\,\sqrt{C}$, and $A = (\sqrt{A})^2$, $C = (\sqrt{C})^2$ with $\sqrt{A}, \sqrt{C} \ge 0$. [L2, L5, L6]

1.8 Triangle inequality for $d_\infty$: for each $k < n$, $|a_k + b_k| \le |a_k| + |b_k| \le d_\infty(x,y) + d_\infty(y,z)$ because the two maxima bound their sets; so $d_\infty(x,y) + d_\infty(y,z)$ is an upper bound of $\{|a_k + b_k| : k < n\}$, and the maximum $d_\infty(x,z)$ of that set is one of its elements, whence $d_\infty(x,z) \le d_\infty(x,y) + d_\infty(y,z)$. [L3, L8, L9]

2.1 Combining steps 1.6 and 1.7: $\sum_{k<n}(a_k+b_k)^2 = A + 2B + C \le (\sqrt{A})^2 + 2\sqrt{A}\sqrt{C} + (\sqrt{C})^2 = \big(\sqrt{A} + \sqrt{C}\big)^2$. [step 1.6, step 1.7, L9, algebra]

3.1 Both $d_2(x,z) = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}(a_k+b_k)^2}$ and $\sqrt{A} + \sqrt{C}$ are nonnegative, and by step 2.1 the square of the first is at most the square of the second, so monotonicity of squaring on the nonnegatives gives $d_2(x,z) \le \sqrt{A} + \sqrt{C} = d_2(x,y) + d_2(y,z)$. [step 2.1, L6, L7]

4.1 Each of $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_\infty$ satisfies (M1) by steps 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3, satisfies (M2) by step 1.4, and satisfies (M3) by steps 1.5, 3.1 and 1.8 respectively; hence all three are metrics on $\mathbb{R}^n$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.8, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **$\mathbb{R}^n$ is defined ZFC-natively here**, as the set of functions from
  the von Neumann natural $n$ to $\mathbb{R}$, precisely so that its coordinates
  are indexed by $k < n$ and the finite-sum machinery of [[def-finite-sum]],
  [[thm-minkowski-finite]] and [[thm-cauchy-schwarz-finite]], all of which sum
  over $k < n$, applies without any reindexing.
- **No rational power appears anywhere above.** The triangle inequality for
  $d_2$ is obtained from Cauchy-Schwarz and the existence of square roots, not
  from Minkowski at $p = 2$, so this lemma does not depend on the theory of
  rational exponents. Minkowski is used only at $p = 1$, where its statement is
  the termwise sum of the two-term triangle inequality.
- **The three metrics are Lipschitz equivalent, with explicit constants,** and
  in particular have the same topology; that computation is on the companion
  page and is not needed here.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b \in F$.

1. If $a > 0$ then $a^{-1} > 0$.
2. If $0 < a < b$ then $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b \in F$.

[L1] $x > 0 \iff x \in P$; $x < 0 \iff -x \in P$; and for $x \neq 0$ exactly one of $x \in P$, $-x \in P$ holds ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Sign rules: a product of a positive and a negative is negative, a product of two positives is positive, and for $c > 0$ one has $a < b \iff ac < bc$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

[L3] $0 < 1$; in particular $1 \neq 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L4] $P$ is closed under addition, so $<$ is transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a > 0$, so $a \neq 0$ and its inverse $a^{-1}$ exists with $a \cdot a^{-1} = 1$; moreover $a^{-1} \neq 0$, since $a^{-1}$ has $a$ as its inverse while $0$ is non-invertible ($1 \neq 0$ by L3). [assume-hyp, L1, L3]

2.1 By trichotomy $a^{-1} \in P$ or $-a^{-1} \in P$; if $-a^{-1} \in P$, then $a > 0$ and $a^{-1} < 0$ give $a \cdot a^{-1} < 0$ by the sign rules, i.e. $1 < 0$, contradicting $0 < 1$; hence $a^{-1} \in P$, i.e. $a^{-1} > 0$, proving claim 1. [step 1.1, L2, L3, L1]

3.1 Assume $0 < a < b$; then $0 < b$ by transitivity, so by claim 1 both $a^{-1} > 0$ and $b^{-1} > 0$, and the sign rules give $a^{-1} b^{-1} > 0$. [assume-hyp, step 2.1, L4, L2, L1]

4.1 Multiplying $a < b$ by the positive $a^{-1} b^{-1}$ via the sign rules gives $a (a^{-1} b^{-1}) < b (a^{-1} b^{-1})$; since $a a^{-1} = 1$ and $b b^{-1} = 1$, this simplifies to $b^{-1} < a^{-1}$. [step 3.1, L2, algebra]

5.1 Together with $b^{-1} > 0$ from step 3.1, we conclude $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$, proving claim 2. [step 3.1, step 4.1] ∎

## Statement

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $p \in \mathbb{Q}$ with $p \ge 1$, with the norms
of [[def-p-norms-on-rn]]. Then:

1. $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$ is a norm on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
   ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]).
2. For $n \ge 1$, $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ is a norm on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
3. **The dictionary.** For $n \ge 1$ and all $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$,
   $$\lVert x-y\rVert_1 = d_1(x,y), \qquad \lVert x-y\rVert_2 = d_2(x,y), \qquad \lVert x-y\rVert_\infty = d_\infty(x,y),$$
   where $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_\infty$ are the metrics of the published
   [[lem-metrics-on-rn]]. So the metric induced by each of these three norms
   ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]) **is** the correspondingly named published
   metric, not merely one equivalent to it.

**Consequence, used repeatedly below and stated once here.** By clause 3 at
$p = 2$, the metric space $(\mathbb{R}^{n}, d_2)$ of the published metric-spaces
page and the metric space underlying the normed space
$(\mathbb{R}^{n}, \lVert\cdot\rVert_2)$ of this page are the same object. Hence
completeness ([[thm-euclidean-space-complete]] clause 2), Heine-Borel
([[thm-heine-borel-rn]] clause 2) and the compactness equivalences
([[thm-metric-compactness-equivalences]]) are statements about this page's normed
space, **with their hypothesis $n \ge 1$ inherited unchanged and not weakened**.
Nothing below cites any of those three theorems for $n = 0$.

**Why this lemma exists.** Without it the library would hold a norm-induced
metric on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and a separately published metric on the same set with
no recorded relation, and every later citation would have to guess which was
meant. The proof of clause 3 is a comparison of two written expressions; the
value is that the comparison is made and recorded.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural number $n$, a rational $p \ge 1$, vectors $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ and a real $\lambda$; write $S(x) := \sum_{k<n}|x_k|^{p}$, so that $\lVert x\rVert_p = S(x)^{1/p}$ ([[def-p-norms-on-rn]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[A1] For clauses 2 and 3, $n \ge 1$, so that $\{|x_k| : k<n\}$ is a nonempty finite set of reals ([[def-p-norms-on-rn]], [[lem-metrics-on-rn]]).

[L1] Rational powers ([[def-rational-power]], [[lem-rational-power-laws]]): for $a, b \ge 0$ and rationals $r, s > 0$ one has $a^{r} \ge 0$, $(ab)^{r} = a^{r}b^{r}$, $0^{r} = 0$, and $a^{r} > 0$ when $a > 0$; and for $a > 0$, $(a^{r})^{s} = a^{rs}$ and $a^{1} = a$.

[L2] Monotonicity in the base ([[lem-rational-power-monotone]] clause 2): for a rational $r > 0$ and reals $0 \le a < b$ one has $a^{r} < b^{r}$; hence $a \le b$ implies $a^{r} \le b^{r}$, the case $a = b$ being trivial, and $a^{r} = 0$ only for $a = 0$.

[L3] Laws of finite sums ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[def-finite-sum]]): additivity, scaling, monotonicity; a sum of nonnegative terms is nonnegative, each single term is at most such a sum, and a sum of nonnegative terms that vanishes has every term $0$.

[L4] Minkowski's inequality for finite sums at rational $p \ge 1$ ([[thm-minkowski-finite]]): $\bigl(\sum_{k<n}|a_k+b_k|^{p}\bigr)^{1/p} \le \bigl(\sum_{k<n}|a_k|^{p}\bigr)^{1/p} + \bigl(\sum_{k<n}|b_k|^{p}\bigr)^{1/p}$.

[L5] Absolute value ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]], [[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]): $|t| \ge 0$; $|t| = 0$ exactly when $t = 0$; $|st| = |s|\,|t|$; $|s+t| \le |s|+|t|$; and $|t|^{2} = t^{2}$.

[L6] Maxima ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]): a nonempty finite set of reals has a maximum, the maximum belongs to the set and bounds it above, and a set with an upper bound belonging to it has that element as its maximum.

[L7] Order arithmetic: multiplying an inequality by a nonnegative real preserves it ([[lem-of-sign-rules]] in its strict form, together with the case of equality settled by totality), and $\le$ is transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L8] The norm axioms (N1), (N2), (N3) ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]); $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ agrees with the Euclidean norm of [[def-euclidean-inner-product]], and is a norm by [[thm-cauchy-schwarz-and-the-euclidean-norm]]; square roots are the rational power at exponent $1/2$ ([[thm-of-square-roots]], [[def-p-norms-on-rn]]).

[L9] The published metrics on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n \ge 1$ are $d_1(x,y) = \sum_{k<n}|x_k-y_k|$, $d_2(x,y) = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}(x_k-y_k)^{2}}$ and $d_\infty(x,y) = \max\{|x_k-y_k| : k<n\}$, and each is a metric ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]], [[def-metric-space]], [[def-metric-topology]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Every term $|x_k|^{p}$ is nonnegative, so $S(x) \ge 0$ and $\lVert x\rVert_p = S(x)^{1/p}$ is defined and nonnegative. [L1, L3]

1.2 $S(x) = 0$ holds exactly when $|x_k|^{p} = 0$ for every $k<n$, a vanishing sum of nonnegative terms having every term $0$; and $|x_k|^{p} = 0$ exactly when $|x_k| = 0$, that is exactly when $x_k = 0$. [L1, L2, L3, L5]

1.3 For every $k<n$, $|(\lambda x)_k|^{p} = \bigl(|\lambda|\,|x_k|\bigr)^{p} = |\lambda|^{p}|x_k|^{p}$, so $S(\lambda x) = |\lambda|^{p}S(x)$ by scaling of finite sums. [L1, L3, L5]

1.4 Instantiating [L4] at $a_k := x_k$ and $b_k := y_k$, and using $(x+y)_k = x_k+y_k$, gives $\lVert x+y\rVert_p \le \lVert x\rVert_p + \lVert y\rVert_p$, which is axiom (N3) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$. [L4, L8]

1.5 Under [A1] the set $\{|x_k| : k<n\}$ is nonempty and finite, so $\lVert x\rVert_\infty$ exists, is one of the $|x_k|$, and satisfies $|x_k| \le \lVert x\rVert_\infty$ for every $k<n$; in particular $\lVert x\rVert_\infty \ge 0$. [A1, L5, L6]

1.6 Under [A1], $\lVert x-y\rVert_1 = \sum_{k<n}|x_k-y_k|$ by the case $p=1$ of the definition, and that is the written expression for $d_1(x,y)$. [L1, L9]

1.7 Under [A1], $\lVert x-y\rVert_2 = \bigl(\sum_{k<n}|x_k-y_k|^{2}\bigr)^{1/2} = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}(x_k-y_k)^{2}}$, using $|t|^{2} = t^{2}$ and the identification of the exponent $1/2$ with the nonnegative square root, and that is the written expression for $d_2(x,y)$. [L5, L8, L9]

1.8 Under [A1], $\lVert x-y\rVert_\infty = \max\{|x_k-y_k| : k<n\}$ by definition, and that is the written expression for $d_\infty(x,y)$. [L9]

2.1 $\lVert x\rVert_p = 0$ holds exactly when $S(x) = 0$, since $S(x) > 0$ would give $S(x)^{1/p} > 0$ and $0^{1/p} = 0$. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.2 Under [A1]: $\lVert x\rVert_\infty = 0$ forces $|x_k| \le 0$ and $|x_k| \ge 0$ for every $k<n$, hence $x = 0$; and $\lVert 0\rVert_\infty = 0$. This is (N1) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$. [step 1.5, L5, L8]

2.3 Under [A1]: for every $k<n$, $|(\lambda x)_k| = |\lambda|\,|x_k| \le |\lambda|\,\lVert x\rVert_\infty$, and choosing $j<n$ with $|x_j| = \lVert x\rVert_\infty$ gives $|(\lambda x)_j| = |\lambda|\,\lVert x\rVert_\infty$; so $|\lambda|\lVert x\rVert_\infty$ belongs to the set and bounds it above, whence $\lVert \lambda x\rVert_\infty = |\lambda|\lVert x\rVert_\infty$. This is (N2) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$. [step 1.5, L5, L6, L7]

2.4 Under [A1]: for every $k<n$, $|(x+y)_k| = |x_k+y_k| \le |x_k| + |y_k| \le \lVert x\rVert_\infty + \lVert y\rVert_\infty$; choosing $j<n$ with $|(x+y)_j| = \lVert x+y\rVert_\infty$ gives $\lVert x+y\rVert_\infty \le \lVert x\rVert_\infty + \lVert y\rVert_\infty$, which is (N3) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$. [step 1.5, L5, L6, L7]

3.1 By steps 2.1 and 1.2, $\lVert x\rVert_p = 0$ exactly when $x_k = 0$ for every $k<n$, that is exactly when $x = 0$; this is axiom (N1) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$. [step 2.1, step 1.2, L8]

3.2 Steps 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 are (N1), (N2) and (N3) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ under [A1], so clause 2 holds. [step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, A1, L8]

4.1 If $\lambda = 0$ then $\lambda x = 0$ and both sides of (N2) are $0$ by step 3.1; if $\lambda \ne 0$ then $|\lambda| > 0$, and step 1.3 with the power laws gives $\lVert \lambda x\rVert_p = \bigl(|\lambda|^{p}S(x)\bigr)^{1/p} = \bigl(|\lambda|^{p}\bigr)^{1/p}S(x)^{1/p} = |\lambda|^{p\cdot(1/p)}\lVert x\rVert_p = |\lambda|\,\lVert x\rVert_p$; this is axiom (N2). [step 1.3, step 3.1, L1, L5, L8]

5.1 Steps 3.1, 4.1 and 1.4 are (N1), (N2) and (N3) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$, so clause 1 holds. [step 1.4, step 3.1, step 4.1, L8]

6.1 Steps 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8 give clause 3, and with steps 5.1 and 3.2 all three clauses are proved; in particular the metric induced by $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n \ge 1$ is the published $d_2$, which is the consequence recorded in the Statement. [step 5.1, step 3.2, step 1.6, step 1.7, step 1.8, L9] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the consequence does and does not license.** Because the two metric spaces are literally the same, a published theorem about $(\mathbb{R}^{n}, d_2)$ may be quoted here verbatim. It may **not** be quoted with a weaker hypothesis: [[thm-euclidean-space-complete]], [[thm-heine-borel-rn]] and [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] are all stated for $n \ge 1$ only, because $d_\infty$ is a maximum over an empty index set at $n = 0$, and every item on this page that uses one of them carries $n \ge 1$ in its own statement.

- **Clause 1 holds at $n = 0$ and clause 2 does not apply there.** At $n = 0$ every $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$ is the zero function on the one-element space $\mathbb{R}^{0}$, which is the unique norm on the zero space ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]); $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ is not defined there at all.

- **The route to (N3) differs between the two families, and that is not an accident.** For $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$ the triangle inequality is Minkowski's inequality, a genuine theorem about rational powers; for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ it is the elementary argument of step 2.4, that a maximum of sums is at most the sum of the maxima. The second argument is the one that needs a nonempty index set.

## Statement

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]), let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $F^{n}$ be the
function space on the von Neumann natural $n = \{0, \dots, n-1\}$, with the
pointwise operations ([[def-function-space]], [[def-natural-numbers]],
[[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]). For $i < n$ define the **standard unit vector**
$e_i \in F^{n}$ by

$$e_i(i) = 1_F, \qquad e_i(j) = 0_F \ \text{ for } j < n \text{ with } j \ne i .$$

Then:

1. **Finite sums in a function space are pointwise.** For every set $X$, every
   $p \in \mathbb{N}$, every list $u : p \to F^{X}$ and every $j \in X$,
   $$\Bigl(\sum_{k<p} u_k\Bigr)(j) \;=\; \sum_{k<p} u_k(j),$$
   the right-hand sum being taken in $(F,+,0_F)$. (Stated here for an arbitrary
   $X$ because the companion page needs it at $X = \mathbb{N}$.)
2. $e : n \to F^{n}$ is an ordered basis of $F^{n}$ ([[def-linear-basis]]); in
   particular $e$ is injective and its image $e[n] = \{\, e_i : i < n \,\}$ is a
   basis of $F^{n}$ with $e[n] \approx n$ ([[def-equinumerous]]);
3. for every $\lambda : n \to F$ and every $j < n$,
   $\bigl(\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i e_i\bigr)(j) = \lambda_j$; equivalently the
   coordinate list of $x \in F^{n}$ with respect to the ordered basis $e$
   ([[thm-unique-coordinates-with-respect-to-an-ordered-basis]]) is
   $i \mapsto x(i)$;
4. $F^{n}$ is finite-dimensional over $F$ with $\dim_F F^{n} = n$
   ([[def-dimension]]);
5. at $n = 0$ this reads: $F^{0}$ has exactly one element, the empty function,
   so $F^{0}$ is the zero space, the empty list is its ordered basis,
   $\varnothing$ is its basis and $\dim_F F^{0} = 0$.

Every index runs from $0$, so the coordinates of an element of $F^{n}$ are
$x_0, \dots, x_{n-1}$ and no statement above is restricted to $n \ge 1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A field $F$, a natural number $n$, the vector space $F^{n}$ with pointwise operations, and the vectors $e_i$ for $i < n$.

[L1] $F^{X}$ is a vector space over $F$ with $(x+y)(j) = x(j)+y(j)$, $(\lambda x)(j) = \lambda\,x(j)$ and zero the constant function at $0_F$; two elements are equal exactly when they agree at every point; and $F^{0}$ has exactly one element, the empty function, which is $0_{F^{0}}$ ([[def-function-space]], [[def-vector-space]]).

[L2] Finite sums: $\sum_{k<0}u_k$ is the zero vector and $\sum_{k<\sigma(p)}u_k = \bigl(\sum_{k<p}u_k\bigr) + u_p$, in any vector space ([[def-monoid-finite-product]], [[def-linear-combination-and-span]]).

[L3] $F$ is a vector space over itself, with the field addition and multiplication ([[lem-restriction-of-scalars]], claim 1), so the finite sums of $\mathbb{N}$-indexed lists of scalars are available in $(F,+,0_F)$ and satisfy (F1) and (F3); in particular a list of scalars vanishing off a single index sums to its value at that index ([[def-sum-of-linear-subspaces]]).

[L4] In $F$: $\lambda 1_F = \lambda$ and $\lambda 0_F = 0_F$ for every $\lambda \in F$ ([[def-field]], [[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]]).

[L5] A list $v : n \to V$ is an ordered basis of $V$ if and only if every $x \in V$ is $\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i v_i$ for exactly one $\lambda : n \to F$; an ordered basis is injective and its image is a basis with $v[n] \approx n$ ([[thm-unique-coordinates-with-respect-to-an-ordered-basis]], [[def-linear-basis]], [[def-linear-independence]], [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L6] $\dim_F V$ is the unique $p \in \mathbb{N}$ with a basis $B \approx p$, defined when $V$ has a finite basis ([[def-dimension]], [[def-countable]]).

[L7] Induction on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Claim 1, that a finite sum in $F^{X}$ is computed pointwise: for every $p \in \mathbb{N}$, every list $u : p \to F^{X}$ and every $j \in X$, $\bigl(\sum_{k<p}u_k\bigr)(j) = \sum_{k<p}u_k(j)$, the right-hand sum being taken in $(F,+,0_F)$. By induction on $p$: at $p = 0$ the left side is the value at $j$ of the constant function $0_F$ and the right side is the empty sum $0_F$; and if it holds at $p$, then $\bigl(\sum_{k<\sigma(p)}u_k\bigr)(j) = \bigl(\sum_{k<p}u_k + u_p\bigr)(j) = \bigl(\sum_{k<p}u_k\bigr)(j) + u_p(j) = \sum_{k<p}u_k(j) + u_p(j) = \sum_{k<\sigma(p)}u_k(j)$, using pointwise addition and the recursion. [L1, L2, L3, L7]

2.1 Evaluating a combination of the $e_i$. Let $\lambda : n \to F$ and $j < n$. By step 1.1 and pointwise scalar multiplication, $\bigl(\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i e_i\bigr)(j) = \sum_{i<n}(\lambda_i e_i)(j) = \sum_{i<n}\lambda_i\, e_i(j)$. The list of scalars $i \mapsto \lambda_i\,e_i(j)$ takes the value $\lambda_i 0_F = 0_F$ at every $i \ne j$ and the value $\lambda_j 1_F = \lambda_j$ at $i = j$, so it vanishes off the single index $j$ and therefore sums to $\lambda_j$. Hence $\bigl(\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i e_i\bigr)(j) = \lambda_j$ for every $j < n$. [step 1.1, L1, L3, L4]

3.1 Existence and uniqueness of coordinates. Given $x \in F^{n}$, put $\lambda_i := x(i)$; by step 2.1 the vectors $\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i e_i$ and $x$ agree at every $j < n$, hence are equal. And if $\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i e_i = \sum_{i<n}\mu_i e_i$, then evaluating both sides at $j$ and using step 2.1 gives $\lambda_j = \mu_j$ for every $j < n$. So every $x \in F^{n}$ is $\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i e_i$ for exactly one $\lambda : n \to F$. [step 2.1, L1]

4.1 Claims 2 and 3. Step 2.1 is claim 3, and by the coordinate characterisation of an ordered basis, step 3.1 says exactly that $e$ is an ordered basis of $F^{n}$; hence $e$ is injective, $e[n]$ is a basis of $F^{n}$, and $e[n] \approx n$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L5]

5.1 Claims 4 and 5. By step 4.1 the space $F^{n}$ has a basis with $n$ elements, so it is finite-dimensional and $\dim_F F^{n} = n$. At $n = 0$ the space $F^{0}$ has exactly one element, the empty function, which is its zero vector, so $F^{0}$ is the zero space; the list $e$ is then the empty list, its image is $\varnothing$, and $\dim_F F^{0} = 0$. [step 4.1, L1, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- **The indices start at $0$ because a natural number is the set of its predecessors.** $F^{n}$ is the function space $F^{X}$ at $X = n = \{0,\dots,n-1\}$ ([[def-function-space]], [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]), so an element of $F^{n}$ is a function on $\{0,\dots,n-1\}$ and there is no $e_n$. Reading the standard basis off a $1$-indexed source would put a vector outside the space at one end and lose one at the other.

- **Step 1.1 is not a triviality to be skipped.** That a finite sum of functions is the pointwise finite sum is a statement about the recursion defining [[def-monoid-finite-product]] in two different monoids, and it is proved by induction. Every evaluation argument on this page and on the companion page rests on it.

- **This is the concrete counterweight to [[cor-every-vector-space-has-a-basis]].** Here a basis is written down and no choice principle is used anywhere; there a basis is produced by Zorn's lemma and none is exhibited. The companion page carries both extremes for infinite-dimensional spaces as well: an explicit infinite basis for the eventually zero families, and a basis of $\mathbb{R}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ that no argument exhibits.

## What this page spends, implication by implication

[[thm-metric-compactness-equivalences]] states five conditions and asserts that
they are equivalent, under two choice hypotheses. Stated that way the theorem
overcharges almost every arrow it contains, so this remark records the arrows one
at a time. Every entry is a statement about **the proof given in this library**,
and about nothing else.

**Theorems of ZF, using no choice principle at all.**

- A compact subset of a metric space is closed and bounded
  ([[thm-compact-subset-is-closed-and-bounded]]).
- A compact metric space is complete and totally bounded
  ([[thm-compact-implies-complete-and-totally-bounded]]). Completeness is
  obtained there from the finite intersection characterisation applied to the
  closures of the tails of a Cauchy sequence, precisely so that the argument does
  not pass through the extraction of a subsequence.
- Compactness implies countable compactness and limit point compactness, and each
  of those implies sequential compactness
  ([[thm-compact-implies-the-other-compactness-forms]]). The two arrows into
  sequential compactness extract a subsequence by taking, at every stage, the
  **least** admissible index.
- A sequentially compact metric space is complete
  ([[lem-sequentially-compact-implies-complete]]).
- A closed subset of a compact metric space is compact, a continuous image of a
  compact space is compact, the extreme value theorem, the Lebesgue number lemma,
  Heine-Cantor, and the continuity of the inverse of a continuous bijection from
  a compact space.
- Heine-Borel in $\mathbb{R}^n$ ([[thm-heine-borel-rn]]), by a bisection in which
  each step halves one coordinate and keeps the left half when the left half is
  still not finitely covered.

**Using the Axiom of Countable Choice** ([[def-countable-choice]]), spent once and
named at the step that spends it.

- A complete, totally bounded metric space is compact
  ([[thm-complete-and-totally-bounded-implies-compact]]): one finite
  $1/(n+1)$-net, together with a listing of it, is fixed for every $n$ at once.
- A compact metric space has an at most countable dense subset
  ([[lem-compact-metric-space-has-a-countable-dense-subset]]): the same
  selection, and the countable union theorem it then invokes carries the same
  hypothesis and no more.

**Using the Axiom of Dependent Choice** ([[def-dependent-choice]]).

- A sequentially compact metric space is totally bounded
  ([[thm-sequentially-compact-implies-totally-bounded]]). This is the only
  implication on the page with that cost. The construction adds one point at a
  time, each at distance at least $\varepsilon$ from all the points already
  produced, so the set the next point is drawn from is not known until the
  earlier ones are fixed. Countable choice returns one $\varepsilon$-separated
  tuple for each length with no coherence between them, and no diagonal argument
  assembles those into a single separated sequence.

## What is claimed and what is not

**Claimed:** each proof in this library can be carried out in ZF together with
the principle named above, and in no case is more used than is named.

**Not claimed:** that any of these principles is *necessary*. Showing that an
implication cannot be proved in ZF alone is an independence result, obtained by
forcing or by permutation models, and this library contains neither and proves
none. Every cost above is an upper bound. The systematic study of which forms of
compactness need which fragment of choice is a subject in its own right, and
Herrlich's *Axiom of Choice* is the standard reference; it is cited here as
literature and is not used.

**Not claimed either:** that a cost recorded for one proof is a cost of the
statement. Two proofs of the same implication may spend differently, and the
completeness half of
[[thm-compact-implies-complete-and-totally-bounded]] is exactly a case where the
textbook route and the route taken here differ in what they use.

## How to read the equivalence theorem

A cycle of implications transmits the weakest hypothesis around the whole cycle:
once [[thm-metric-compactness-equivalences]] has closed its cycle, every one of
its five conditions implies every other *under both hypotheses*. The individual
arrows do not inherit that. A reader working in ZF alone still has, without any
choice at all, that a compact metric space satisfies all four of the other
conditions, and that a sequentially compact one is complete. What fails in ZF, as
far as this library's proofs go, is the journey back from the weaker conditions to
compactness.

Where these principles sit relative to one another — that the Axiom of Choice
implies dependent choice, which implies countable choice, and that the reverse
implications are relative-consistency results quoted rather than proved — is
recorded in [[def-dependent-choice]] and in the definitions it points to.

## Statement

Let $(X,d)$ be a nonempty compact metric space ([[def-metric-compactness]],
[[def-metric-space]]) and let $f : X \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous
([[def-metric-continuity]]), $\mathbb{R}$ carrying its usual metric
$d_{\mathbb{R}}(s,t) = |s-t|$ ([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]). Then the
image $f[X]$ is bounded above and below ([[def-bounded-set]]), and it has a
maximum and a minimum ([[def-max-min]]): there are points
$x_{\max}, x_{\min} \in X$ with

$$f(x_{\min}) \;\le\; f(x) \;\le\; f(x_{\max}) \qquad \text{for every } x \in X,$$

and then $f(x_{\max}) = \sup f[X]$ and $f(x_{\min}) = \inf f[X]$
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-infimum]]).

Nonemptiness of $X$ is a hypothesis and not an oversight: for $X = \emptyset$ the
image is empty and has neither a supremum nor a maximum. No choice principle is
used.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A nonempty compact metric space $(X,d)$ and a continuous $f : X \to \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] The image of a compact metric space under a continuous map is a compact subset of the codomain ([[thm-continuous-image-of-a-compact-space-is-compact]]).

[L2] A compact subset of a metric space is closed and bounded ([[thm-compact-subset-is-closed-and-bounded]], [[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]], [[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]).

[L3] In $(\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$ the ball $B(x_0,\rho)$ is the interval $(x_0-\rho, x_0+\rho)$ ([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]], [[def-metric-ball]], [[def-interval]]).

[L4] A nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above has a supremum, and one bounded below has an infimum ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-infimum]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L5] For $S$ nonempty and bounded above with supremum $u$: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $s \in S$ with $u - \varepsilon < s \le u$; dually for the infimum ([[lem-sup-epsilon]], [[lem-inf-epsilon]]).

[L6] $x$ lies in the closure of $S$ exactly when every ball around $x$ meets $S$, and a closed set contains its closure ([[def-metric-interior-closure-boundary]], [[thm-metric-closure-characterisation]], [[def-metric-topology]]).

[L7] A subset of a metric space is compact exactly when the corresponding metric subspace is compact, the subspace metric being the restriction ([[def-metric-compactness]], [[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $f[X]$ is a compact subset of $(\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$, and it is nonempty because $X$ is. [L1, L7]

2.1 So $f[X]$ is closed in $\mathbb{R}$ and bounded as a subset of the metric space $(\mathbb{R},d_{\mathbb{R}})$: there are $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ and a real $\rho > 0$ with $f[X] \subseteq B(x_0,\rho) = (x_0-\rho,\ x_0+\rho)$. [L2, L3, step 1.1]

3.1 Hence $x_0 + \rho$ is an upper bound and $x_0 - \rho$ a lower bound of $f[X]$, so $f[X]$ is bounded above and below, and being nonempty it has a supremum $u$ and an infimum $\ell$. [L4, step 2.1]

4.1 For every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $t \in f[X]$ with $u - \varepsilon < t \le u$, so $|t - u| < \varepsilon$ and $t \in B(u,\varepsilon) \cap f[X]$; therefore every ball around $u$ meets $f[X]$ and $u$ lies in the closure of $f[X]$. [L3, L5, L6, step 3.1]

5.1 Since $f[X]$ is closed, $u \in f[X]$; so $u$ is a member of $f[X]$ bounding it above, that is $u = \max f[X]$, and $u = f(x_{\max})$ for some $x_{\max} \in X$. [L6, step 2.1, step 4.1]

6.1 The same argument with $\ell$ in place of $u$, using the infimum form of step 4.1, gives $\ell \in f[X]$, so $\ell = \min f[X]$ and $\ell = f(x_{\min})$ for some $x_{\min} \in X$. [L5, L6, step 3.1, step 5.1]

7.1 For every $x \in X$ the value $f(x)$ lies in $f[X]$, hence $f(x_{\min}) = \ell \le f(x) \le u = f(x_{\max})$, which is the assertion, with $f(x_{\max}) = \sup f[X]$ and $f(x_{\min}) = \inf f[X]$. [L4, step 3.1, step 5.1, step 6.1] ∎

## Remarks

**Compactness is what is used, not boundedness of the domain.** A bounded non-compact domain is not enough: on the interval $(0,1)$ the identity map is continuous and bounded with no greatest value, and $x \mapsto 1/x$ is continuous and unbounded ([[cex-evt-fails-without-compactness]]).

**Why the supremum has to be shown to be attained at all.** $\sup f[X]$ exists as soon as $f[X]$ is nonempty and bounded above, which needs only boundedness; what compactness adds is that $f[X]$ is closed, and a closed set contains the supremum it approaches. Steps 4.1 and 5.1 are exactly that passage, and they are where the theorem is more than the least-upper-bound property.

## Statement

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, let $\mathbb{R}^n$ be the set of functions
$n \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $d_2$ be the Euclidean metric on it
([[lem-metrics-on-rn]]). Then:

1. **Closed boxes are compact.** For reals $a_k \le b_k$ $(k < n)$ the box
   $Q = \{\, x \in \mathbb{R}^n : a_k \le x_k \le b_k \text{ for every } k < n \,\}$
   is a compact subset of $(\mathbb{R}^n, d_2)$ ([[def-metric-compactness]]).
2. **Heine-Borel.** A subset $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is a compact subset of
   $(\mathbb{R}^n, d_2)$ if and only if $K$ is closed in $\mathbb{R}^n$
   ([[def-metric-topology]]) and bounded
   ([[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]).
3. **The real line.** A subset $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a compact subset of
   $(\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$, the usual metric $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) = |x-y|$
   ([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]), if and only if $K$ is closed in
   $\mathbb{R}$ and bounded.

**No choice principle is used.** The bisection below halves one coordinate at a
time and takes the **left** half whenever the left half still fails to be finitely
covered, the right half otherwise: a rule with two outcomes, decided by a
property of the box, not a selection. That is the whole reason the theorem is
available in ZF, while the general "complete and totally bounded implies compact"
([[thm-complete-and-totally-bounded-implies-compact]]) is not.

The hypothesis $n \ge 1$ is inherited from [[lem-metrics-on-rn]], which defines
$\mathbb{R}^n$ and its metrics only there; the last remark below records what
happens at $n = 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural number $n \ge 1$, the metric space $(\mathbb{R}^n, d_2)$, and the notions of open, closed, bounded and compact subset in it.

[L1] $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the set of functions $n \to \mathbb{R}$, and $d_2(x,y) = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}(x_k-y_k)^2}$, $d_\infty(x,y) = \max\{|x_k - y_k| : k < n\}$ are metrics on it ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]], [[def-finite-sum]], [[def-metric-space]]).

[L2] Finite sums of nonnegative terms dominate each term and are monotone, and $\sum_{k<n} c = \iota(n)c$ for a constant $c$, $\iota(n)$ being the canonical natural of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[def-finite-sum]], [[def-canonical-natural]]).

[L3] For $a,b \ge 0$: $a \le b$ exactly when $a^2 \le b^2$; every $a \ge 0$ has a unique nonnegative square root; and $\sqrt{c^2} = |c|$ for every real $c$ ([[lem-of-square-monotone]], [[thm-of-square-roots]], [[def-abs-value]]).

[L4] A subset $A$ is compact exactly when every family $(U_i)_{i \in I}$ of open subsets of the ambient space with $A \subseteq \bigcup_{i \in I} U_i$ has finitely many members whose union contains $A$, or $A = \emptyset$; and the sets open in the subspace $A$ are exactly the traces on $A$ of the open subsets of the ambient space, so, taking complements inside $A$, the sets closed in $A$ are exactly the traces on $A$ of the closed subsets of the ambient space ([[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]], [[def-metric-compactness]], [[def-metric-topology]], [[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]).

[L5] A compact subset of a metric space is closed and bounded ([[thm-compact-subset-is-closed-and-bounded]]).

[L6] A closed subset of a compact metric space is compact ([[lem-closed-subset-of-a-compact-space-is-compact]]).

[L7] Nested closed bounded intervals $I_m = [\alpha_m,\beta_m]$ with $I_{m+1} \subseteq I_m$ have nonempty intersection, and the intersection is a single point exactly when the lengths tend to $0$ ([[thm-nested-interval-property]], [[def-interval]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L8] Recursion: for a set $A$, an element $a \in A$ and $f : A \to A$ there is a unique $g : \mathbb{N} \to A$ with $g(0) = a$ and $g(m+1) = f(g(m))$; a stage-dependent rule is handled on $A = \mathbb{N} \times Z$, the first coordinate of $g(m)$ then being $m$ ([[thm-recursion]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[L9] $(1/2)^m \to 0$, integer powers being those of [[def-integer-power]] ([[lem-geometric-sequence-null]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L10] A nonempty finite set of reals has a maximum, one of its members ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L11] $U$ is open exactly when every point of $U$ has a ball inside $U$; a subset is bounded when it is empty or lies in some ball $B(x_0,\rho)$ with $\rho > 0$ ([[def-metric-topology]], [[def-metric-ball]], [[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]).

[L12] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/N < \eta$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For $x,y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $k < n$ the term $(x_k-y_k)^2$ is one of the nonnegative terms of $\sum_{j<n}(x_j-y_j)^2$, so $(x_k-y_k)^2 \le d_2(x,y)^2$, and taking nonnegative square roots gives $|x_k - y_k| \le d_2(x,y)$; hence $d_\infty(x,y) \le d_2(x,y)$. [L1, L2, L3]

1.2 Conversely each $(x_j-y_j)^2 \le d_\infty(x,y)^2$, so $d_2(x,y)^2 \le \iota(n)\,d_\infty(x,y)^2 \le \big(\iota(n) d_\infty(x,y)\big)^2$, the last step because $\iota(n) \ge 1$; hence $d_2(x,y) \le \iota(n)\, d_\infty(x,y)$. [L1, L2, L3]

2.1 For claim 1 fix reals $a_k \le b_k$ $(k<n)$ and the box $Q$ they determine, let $(U_i)_{i \in I}$ be open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with $Q \subseteq \bigcup_{i \in I} U_i$, call a set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ **finitely covered** when finitely many of the $U_i$ have union containing $S$, and suppose for contradiction that $Q$ is not finitely covered. [L4, step 1.1, step 1.2, assume-contra]

3.1 For a box $P = \{\, x : c_j \le x_j \le e_j \ (j<n) \,\}$ with $c_j \le e_j$ and for $k < n$, let $P^{k,0}$ and $P^{k,1}$ be the boxes obtained by replacing the $k$-th interval $[c_k,e_k]$ by $[c_k, (c_k+e_k)/2]$ and by $[(c_k+e_k)/2, e_k]$; then $P = P^{k,0} \cup P^{k,1}$ by trichotomy applied to $x_k$ against the midpoint, the $k$-th side length of each is $(e_k-c_k)/2$ and the others are unchanged, and if both halves were finitely covered so would $P$ be, the union of two finite subfamilies being finite. Define $H_k(P) := P^{k,0}$ if $P^{k,0}$ is not finitely covered, and $H_k(P) := P^{k,1}$ otherwise; this is a definition by a property, and $H_k(P)$ is not finitely covered whenever $P$ is. [L7, step 2.1]

4.1 Recursion on $\mathbb{N} \times Z$, with $Z$ the set of functions from boxes to boxes, starting value $(0, \mathrm{id})$ and rule $(j, h) \mapsto (j+1,\ H_j \circ h)$ for $j < n$ and $(j,h) \mapsto (j+1,h)$ otherwise, produces $G_j$ for every $j$; put $G := G_n$. By induction on $j \le n$, $G_j(P) \subseteq P$ is a box whose $k$-th side is half that of $P$ for $k < j$ and equal to that of $P$ for $k \ge j$, and $G_j(P)$ is not finitely covered when $P$ is not. So $G(P) \subseteq P$ halves every side and preserves not being finitely covered. [L8, step 3.1]

5.1 Recursion applied to the starting value $Q$ and the rule $G$ produces boxes $P_m$ with $P_0 = Q$ and $P_{m+1} = G(P_m)$; each $P_m$ fails to be finitely covered, $P_{m+1} \subseteq P_m$, and the $k$-th side length of $P_m$ is $\ell_k (1/2)^m$, where $\ell_k := b_k - a_k \ge 0$. [L8, step 4.1]

6.1 For each $k < n$ the $k$-th intervals of the $P_m$ form a nested family of closed bounded intervals whose lengths $\ell_k(1/2)^m$ tend to $0$, so their intersection is a single point $p_k$; the function $p : n \to \mathbb{R}$, $k \mapsto p_k$, is a point of $\mathbb{R}^n$ lying in every $P_m$. [L7, L9, step 5.1]

7.1 Since $p \in P_0 = Q \subseteq \bigcup_{i \in I} U_i$, there is $i^{\ast} \in I$ with $p \in U_{i^{\ast}}$, and openness gives a real $r > 0$ with $B(p,r) \subseteq U_{i^{\ast}}$. [L11, step 6.1]

8.1 Put $L := \max\{\ell_k : k < n\} \ge 0$ and $C := \iota(n) L + 1 > 0$; for $x \in P_m$ each $|x_k - p_k|$ is at most the $k$-th side length of $P_m$, so $d_\infty(x,p) \le L (1/2)^m$ and $d_2(x,p) \le \iota(n) L (1/2)^m \le C (1/2)^m$ by step 1.2. Taking a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/N < r/C$ and then $m$ with $(1/2)^m < 1/N$ gives $P_m \subseteq B(p,r) \subseteq U_{i^{\ast}}$, so $P_m$ is finitely covered by the single set $U_{i^{\ast}}$, contradicting step 5.1. [L9, L10, L12, step 1.2, step 5.1, step 6.1, step 7.1, discharge-contradiction]

9.1 Therefore every such family has finitely many members covering $Q$, and $Q$ is a compact subset of $(\mathbb{R}^n,d_2)$: claim 1 is proved. [L4, step 2.1, step 8.1]

10.1 For claim 2, a compact $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is closed and bounded. [L5, step 9.1]

11.1 Conversely let $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ be closed and bounded; if $K = \emptyset$ it is compact, and otherwise $K \subseteq B(x_0,\rho)$ for some $x_0$ and real $\rho > 0$, so every $x \in K$ and $k < n$ satisfy $|x_k| \le |(x_0)_k| + |x_k - (x_0)_k| \le |(x_0)_k| + d_2(x,x_0) < |(x_0)_k| + \rho$ by step 1.1; with $M := \max\{|(x_0)_k| : k < n\} + \rho$ the box $Q_M := \{\, x : -M \le x_k \le M \ (k<n) \,\}$ contains $K$. [L10, L11, step 1.1, step 10.1]

12.1 $K$ is the trace on $Q_M$ of a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, namely of $K$ itself, so $K$ is closed in the metric subspace $Q_M$; that subspace is compact by step 9.1, so $K$ is compact, and claim 2 is proved. [L4, L6, step 9.1, step 11.1]

13.1 For claim 3, let $\psi : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^1$ send $t$ to the function $1 \to \mathbb{R}$ with value $t$; it is a bijection and $d_2(\psi(s),\psi(t)) = \sqrt{(s-t)^2} = |s-t| = d_{\mathbb{R}}(s,t)$, so $\psi$ carries each ball onto the corresponding ball, hence open sets onto open sets and open covers onto open covers with matching finite subfamilies, and likewise closed sets onto closed sets and bounded sets onto bounded sets. Applying claim 2 with $n = 1$ to $\psi[K]$ therefore gives claim 3. [L1, L3, L4, L11, step 12.1] ∎

## Remarks

**Why the bisection halves one coordinate at a time.** Halving all $n$ coordinates at once produces $2^n$ sub-boxes, and choosing one of them canonically means enumerating them, which needs a bijection between the functions $n \to \{0,1\}$ and a natural number. Halving a single coordinate produces two sub-boxes, and "the left one if it is still not finitely covered, the right one otherwise" is a definition by cases needing nothing at all. Composing $n$ such halvings, as step 4.1 does, recovers the full halving of every side and keeps the construction canonical, which is what a choice-free proof requires.

**Where each hypothesis is used.** Closedness enters only at step 12.1, through [[lem-closed-subset-of-a-compact-space-is-compact]]; boundedness enters only at step 11.1, to fit $K$ inside a box. Dropping either leaves a non-compact set: the whole of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is closed and unbounded, and an open ball is bounded and not closed, and neither is compact by claim 2.

**The converse direction is what fails in a general metric space.** Claim 2 says that in $\mathbb{R}^n$ closed and bounded is enough; that is special to $\mathbb{R}^n$, and [[fs-closed-and-bounded-implies-compact-in-every-metric-space]] records the false general statement together with a witness. What survives in every metric space is only the direction of step 10.1 ([[thm-compact-subset-is-closed-and-bounded]]).

**The case $n = 0$.** $\mathbb{R}^0$ has exactly one element, the empty function, and [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] does not treat it, because $d_\infty$ would be a maximum over the empty index set. On a one-element set the only metric is the one taking the value $0$, and the resulting space is compact for trivial reasons: it is listed as $\{x_0\}$, and any family of open sets covering it has a member containing $x_0$ ([[def-metric-compactness]]). Nothing above is needed for that case and nothing above claims it.

## Statement

Let $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ be metric spaces ([[def-metric-space]]) and let
$f : X \to Y$ be a function, with images and preimages written $f[\,\cdot\,]$
and $f^{-1}[\,\cdot\,]$ ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]). The following
five statements are equivalent.

- **(a)** $f$ is continuous at every point of $X$ in the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$
  sense ([[def-metric-continuity]]).
- **(b)** $f^{-1}[V]$ is open in $X$ for every open $V \subseteq Y$
  ([[def-metric-topology]]).
- **(c)** $f^{-1}[G]$ is closed in $X$ for every closed $G \subseteq Y$.
- **(d)** $f$ is **sequentially continuous**: whenever $x_k \to x$ in $(X,d_X)$,
  also $f(x_k) \to f(x)$ in $(Y,d_Y)$ ([[def-metric-convergence]]).
- **(e)** $f[\overline{A}] \subseteq \overline{f[A]}$ for every $A \subseteq X$
  ([[def-metric-interior-closure-boundary]]).

**Where choice is used.** Only the implication (d) $\Rightarrow$ (e) uses a
choice principle, and it uses it only through
[[thm-metric-sequential-closure]], whose forward direction spends the Axiom of
Countable Choice ([[def-countable-choice]]). The cycle
(a) $\Rightarrow$ (b) $\Rightarrow$ (c) $\Rightarrow$ (e) $\Rightarrow$ (a) and
the implication (a) $\Rightarrow$ (d) are choice free.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Metric spaces $(X,d_X)$, $(Y,d_Y)$ and a function $f : X \to Y$; a point $a \in X$, a real $\varepsilon > 0$, subsets $A \subseteq X$, $V \subseteq Y$ open and $G \subseteq Y$ closed, and a sequence $(x_k)$ in $X$.

[A1] Continuity at $a$: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $\delta > 0$ with $f[B_X(a,\delta)] \subseteq B_Y(f(a),\varepsilon)$ ([[def-metric-continuity]], [[def-metric-ball]]).

[A2] Open and closed: $U$ is open when every point of $U$ has a ball around it inside $U$; $G$ is closed when its complement is open ([[def-metric-topology]]).

[L1] Preimages respect complements: $f^{-1}[Y \setminus G] = X \setminus f^{-1}[G]$, since $f(x) \in Y \setminus G$ holds exactly when $f(x) \notin G$ ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L2] Closure: $\overline{A}$ consists of the points every ball around which meets $A$; it is closed, contains $A$, and is contained in every closed superset of $A$ ([[def-metric-interior-closure-boundary]], [[thm-metric-closure-characterisation]]).

[L3] Sequential description of the closure: $x \in \overline{A}$ if and only if some sequence in $A$ converges to $x$; the direction producing the sequence uses countable choice ([[thm-metric-sequential-closure]], [[def-countable-choice]]).

[L4] Convergence: $x_k \to x$ means that for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with $d_X(x_k,x) < \varepsilon$ for $k \ge K$, and producing such a $K$ for every REAL $\varepsilon > 0$ is equivalent, since below any positive real lies a positive rational ([[def-metric-convergence]], [[def-real-limit]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L5] Balls are open and contain their centres ([[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]], [[def-metric-ball]]); and trichotomy of the order of $\mathbb{R}$, so the negation of $t < \varepsilon$ is $t \ge \varepsilon$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 (a) implies (b): let $V \subseteq Y$ be open and $x \in f^{-1}[V]$; since $f(x) \in V$ there is $\varepsilon > 0$ with $B_Y(f(x),\varepsilon) \subseteq V$, and continuity at $x$ supplies $\delta > 0$ with $f[B_X(x,\delta)] \subseteq B_Y(f(x),\varepsilon) \subseteq V$, that is $B_X(x,\delta) \subseteq f^{-1}[V]$; as $x$ was arbitrary, $f^{-1}[V]$ is open. [A1, A2]

1.2 (b) implies (c): let $G \subseteq Y$ be closed; then $Y \setminus G$ is open, so $f^{-1}[Y \setminus G]$ is open by (b), and that set is $X \setminus f^{-1}[G]$, so $f^{-1}[G]$ is closed. [A2, L1]

1.3 (c) implies (e): let $A \subseteq X$; the set $\overline{f[A]}$ is closed in $Y$, so $G_0 := f^{-1}\big[\overline{f[A]}\big]$ is closed in $X$ by (c), and $A \subseteq G_0$ because $f[A] \subseteq \overline{f[A]}$; hence $\overline{A} \subseteq G_0$ by minimality of the closure, which says exactly $f[\overline{A}] \subseteq \overline{f[A]}$. [L2]

1.4 (e) implies (a): fix $a \in X$ and a real $\varepsilon > 0$, put $A_\varepsilon := \{x \in X : d_Y(f(x),f(a)) \ge \varepsilon\}$, and suppose no $\delta > 0$ satisfies the continuity condition at $a$ for this $\varepsilon$, that is every ball $B_X(a,\delta)$ contains a point of $A_\varepsilon$; then $a \in \overline{A_\varepsilon}$, so (e) gives $f(a) \in f[\overline{A_\varepsilon}] \subseteq \overline{f[A_\varepsilon]}$, so the ball $B_Y(f(a),\varepsilon)$ meets $f[A_\varepsilon]$ and there is $x \in A_\varepsilon$ with $d_Y(f(x),f(a)) < \varepsilon$, contradicting the definition of $A_\varepsilon$; hence some $\delta > 0$ works, and since $a$ and $\varepsilon$ were arbitrary $f$ is continuous everywhere. [assume-hyp, A1, L2, L5]

1.5 (a) implies (d): let $x_k \to x$ and let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given; continuity at $x$ supplies $\delta > 0$ with $f[B_X(x,\delta)] \subseteq B_Y(f(x),\varepsilon)$, and convergence supplies $K$ with $d_X(x_k,x) < \delta$, that is $x_k \in B_X(x,\delta)$, for all $k \ge K$; then $d_Y(f(x_k),f(x)) < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$, so $f(x_k) \to f(x)$. [A1, L4, L5]

1.6 (d) implies (e): let $A \subseteq X$ and let $y \in f[\overline{A}]$, say $y = f(x)$ with $x \in \overline{A}$; by [L3] there is a sequence $(a_k)$ in $A$ with $a_k \to x$, by (d) $f(a_k) \to f(x)$, and $f(a_k) \in f[A]$ for every $k$, so [L3] applied in $Y$ gives $f(x) \in \overline{f[A]}$. [L3]

2.1 Steps 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 close the cycle (a), (b), (c), (e), (a), so those four are equivalent; step 1.5 gives (a) implies (d) and step 1.6 gives (d) implies (e), which is one of the four, so (d) is equivalent to them as well; hence all five statements are equivalent. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6] ∎

## Remarks

- **(b) is the definition of continuity in general topology**, and the theorem is
  what makes the metric $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ definition agree with it. Once (b)
  is available, continuity can be discussed without ever mentioning a metric,
  which is what the later topology pages do.
- **(d) owes its strength to first countability.** Sequential continuity
  implies continuity here only because metric spaces are first countable
  ([[lem-metric-ball-neighbourhood-base]]), which is what
  [[thm-metric-sequential-closure]] rests on. Nothing above should be read as
  saying that sequential continuity always suffices.
- **Preimages, not images.** Nothing here says that $f[U]$ is open for open $U$;
  that is openness of the map, a different condition, which continuity does not
  imply: a constant map is continuous and its image of any nonempty open set is
  a single point. The
  image condition that does hold is the closure inclusion (e), and even that is
  an inclusion and not an equality.

## Statement

Let $F$ be a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]). Then every
$a \in F$ with $a \ge 0$ has a **unique** $s \in F$ with $s \ge 0$ and $s^2 = a$;
we write $s = \sqrt{a}$. Consequently the positive elements of $F$ are exactly the
nonzero squares: $x > 0$ if and only if $x = y^2$ for some $y \neq 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), that is, an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with the least-upper-bound property, and an element $a \in F$ with $a \ge 0$.

[L1] Every nonempty subset of $F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Sign and scaling rules: a product of positives is positive, and for $c > 0$ one has $x < y \iff cx < cy$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

[L3] Squaring is strictly monotone on the nonnegatives: if $0 \le x < y$ then $x^2 < y^2$; in particular squaring is injective on $\{x : x \ge 0\}$ ([[lem-of-square-monotone]]).

[L4] A nonzero square is positive: if $y \neq 0$ then $y^2 > 0$ ([[lem-of-square-positive]]).

[L5] Multiplying inequalities of positives: if $0 < x < y$ and $0 < u < v$ then $xu < yv$ ([[prop-of-multiply-inequalities]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 If $a = 0$, then $s = 0$ satisfies $s \ge 0$ and $s^2 = 0 = a$, so existence holds; assume henceforth $a > 0$. [given, algebra]

1.2 Uniqueness holds once a root exists: if $u, v \ge 0$ satisfy $u^2 = v^2$, then strict monotonicity of squaring on nonnegatives [L3] rules out both $u < v$ and $u > v$, forcing $u = v$; so at most one $s \ge 0$ has $s^2 = a$. [L3, given]

1.3 Define $S = \{ t \in F : t \ge 0 \text{ and } t^2 \le a \}$; then $0 \in S$ because $0 \ge 0$ and $0^2 = 0 \le a$, so $S \neq \emptyset$. [given, algebra]

1.4 The element $1 + a$ is an upper bound of $S$: since $a > 0$ we have $1 + a > 1$, so any $t > 1 + a$ has $t > 1$ and $t > 0$, whence $t^2 = t \cdot t > 1 \cdot t = t > 1 + a > a$, giving $t \notin S$. [given, L2]

2.1 By completeness [L1], $s := \sup S$ exists in $F$; and since $0 \in S$ we have $s \ge 0$. [L1, step 1.3, step 1.4]

3.1 Assume, for contradiction, that $s^2 \neq a$; by trichotomy either $s^2 < a$ or $s^2 > a$. [assume-contra, step 2.1]

4.1 (Case $s^2 < a$.) Choose $h$ with $0 < h < 1$ and $h < \dfrac{a - s^2}{2s + 1}$, possible since $a - s^2 > 0$ and $2s + 1 \ge 1 > 0$; then $h^2 = h \cdot h < h \cdot 1 = h$ and $h(2s+1) < a - s^2$, so $(s+h)^2 = s^2 + 2sh + h^2 < s^2 + 2sh + h = s^2 + h(2s+1) < a$, whence $s + h \in S$ with $s + h > s$, contradicting that $s$ is an upper bound of $S$. [assume-case low, step 3.1, step 2.1, L2, L5, choose]

4.2 (Case $s^2 > a$.) Here $s > 0$ since $s^2 > a \ge 0$; choose $h$ with $0 < h < s$ and $h < \dfrac{s^2 - a}{2s}$, so $2sh < s^2 - a$ and $(s-h)^2 = s^2 - 2sh + h^2 \ge s^2 - 2sh > a$, hence every $t \in S$ has $t^2 \le a < (s-h)^2$ with $t \ge 0$ and $s - h > 0$, so $t < s - h$ by [L3]; thus $s - h$ is an upper bound of $S$ with $s - h < s$, contradicting that $s$ is the least upper bound. [assume-case high, step 3.1, step 2.1, L3, choose]

5.1 Both cases of the disjunction in step 3.1 give a contradiction, so the assumption fails and $s^2 = a$: a unique (by step 1.2) $s = \sqrt{a} \ge 0$ with $s^2 = a$ exists, and applying this to any $x > 0$ writes $x = (\sqrt{x})^2$ with $\sqrt{x} \neq 0$ while conversely any nonzero square is positive by [L4], so the positive elements of $F$ are exactly the nonzero squares. [step 4.1, step 4.2, step 3.1, step 1.2, L4, cases, discharge-contradiction] ∎
