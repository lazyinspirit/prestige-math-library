You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as
an independent adversarial proof-refuter. Return evidence only; Audit-Alpha
alone adjudicates and edits.

## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` Statement or consumer, actively search for a
counterexample or a failure in the witness or cited generated premise. A false
public claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or
materially inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is
nonfatal.

Return no more than 450 words, exactly in this shape:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

For each defect:

```text
FINDING 1
  location: [exact section/fact/step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [exact assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]
```

Always end with:

```text
BOUNDARY: [specific boundary/counterexample checks and disposition]
SOURCES:  [confirm every supplied cited item used by the target was inspected]
CHECKED:  [confirm title, public claim, every numbered step, and Remarks]
```

## Definition

Throughout, $m \in \mathbb{N}$ with $m \ge 1$, and vector-valued functions, their
components and their limits are as in
[[def-vector-valued-functions-limits-and-continuity]].

### The derivative

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$ and let $c \in A$ be
a **limit point of $A$** ([[def-limit-point-r]]). The **difference quotient of
$f$ at $c$** is the vector-valued function

$$q_{f,c} : A \setminus \{c\} \to \mathbb{R}^{m}, \qquad q_{f,c}(x) \;:=\; \frac{1}{x - c}\,\bigl(f(x) - f(c)\bigr),$$

the scalar multiple being that of the vector space $\mathbb{R}^{m}$
([[def-function-space]]); the division is legitimate because $x \ne c$ gives
$x - c \ne 0$. As in [[def-derivative]], $c$ is a limit point of
$A \setminus \{c\}$ as well, since a punctured neighbourhood of $c$ omits $c$.

$f$ is **differentiable at $c$** when $\lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x)$ exists in
$\mathbb{R}^{m}$, and then the **derivative** is

$$f'(c) \;:=\; \lim_{x\to c} q_{f,c}(x) \;\in\; \mathbb{R}^{m}.$$

**The notation denotes a single vector.** At most one $L \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$
satisfies the limit condition, as proved in
[[def-vector-valued-functions-limits-and-continuity]]; this is the vector-valued
form of the obligation [[lem-function-limit-unique]] discharges for real-valued
functions and [[lem-metric-limits-unique]] for sequences.

**The intrinsic form is the definition; the componentwise form is a theorem.**
For $i < m$ the $i$-th component of $q_{f,c}(x)$ is
$\bigl(f_i(x)-f_i(c)\bigr)/(x-c)$, which is the real difference quotient of
$f_i$ at $c$ ([[def-derivative]]). So by
[[thm-componentwise-limits-and-continuity]] clause 2:

> $f$ is differentiable at $c$ **if and only if** every $f_i$ is differentiable
> at $c$, and then $f'(c)_i = f_i'(c)$ for every $i<m$.

Nothing below reverses this order of presentation: the intrinsic limit is what is
defined, and the coordinates are read off it.

**Algebra of derivatives.** If $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$ are differentiable at
$c$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, then $f + g$ and $\lambda f$ are differentiable
at $c$ with $(f+g)'(c) = f'(c)+g'(c)$ and $(\lambda f)'(c) = \lambda f'(c)$: read
componentwise through the displayed equivalence, these are clauses 1 and 2 of the
published [[thm-algebra-of-derivatives]].

### The integral

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$ and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$
([[def-interval]]). $f$ is **integrable on $[a,b]$** when every component
$f_i : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is bounded ([[def-bounded-set]]) and Darboux
integrable in the sense of [[def-darboux-integral]], and then

$$\int_a^b f \;:=\; \text{the function } m \to \mathbb{R} \text{ sending } i \mapsto \int_a^b f_i .$$

**That really is an element of $\mathbb{R}^{m}$.** In this library
$\mathbb{R}^{m}$ is the set of functions $m \to \mathbb{R}$
([[def-function-space]]), not a set of tuples, so the displayed assignment is
literally an element of it; each value $\int_a^b f_i$ is a single real by
[[def-darboux-integral]]. In the standard basis
([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]]) the same object is
$\int_a^b f = \sum_{i<m}\bigl(\int_a^b f_i\bigr)e_i$.

**Oriented limits.** Following [[def-oriented-integral]] componentwise, set

$$\int_a^a f \;:=\; 0 \in \mathbb{R}^{m}, \qquad \int_b^a f \;:=\; -\int_a^b f \quad (a < b),$$

so that $\int_u^v f = -\int_v^u f$ for all $u,v$ in an interval on which $f$ is
integrable. The clauses do not overlap with the case $a<b$, so nothing has to be
checked for consistency, exactly as in [[def-oriented-integral]].

**Linearity.** If $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$ are integrable and
$\lambda,\mu \in \mathbb{R}$ then $\lambda f + \mu g$ is integrable with

$$\int_a^b (\lambda f + \mu g) \;=\; \lambda\int_a^b f + \mu\int_a^b g ,$$

since each side has $i$-th coordinate $\int_a^b(\lambda f_i + \mu g_i)$ and
$\lambda\int_a^b f_i + \mu\int_a^b g_i$ respectively, and those agree by
[[thm-linearity-of-the-integral]].

**Restriction and splitting.** If $f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ then it is
integrable on every closed subinterval, and for $a<c<b$,
$\int_a^b f = \int_a^c f + \int_c^b f$; both are the componentwise readings of
[[lem-integrability-on-a-subinterval]] and
[[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]], applied to each $f_i$ and reassembled
coordinate by coordinate.

## Remarks

- **The two halves are independent.** The derivative clause needs no integral and
  the integral clause needs no derivative; they are collected in one item because
  they are the two constructions of the one-dimensional theory that transfer to
  $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ by the same move, and because
  [[cor-vector-valued-ftc-and-lipschitz-bound]] is what joins them.

- **Why the intrinsic derivative is stated first.** The componentwise formula is
  the one used in computations, but it is tied to the standard basis, whereas the
  limit of the difference quotient is not. The intrinsic form is the one that
  survives when the domain is enlarged from an interval to a subset of
  $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, which is a later page of this track.

- **No norm appears in either definition.** The derivative is a limit in
  $(\mathbb{R}^{m}, d_2)$, and by [[thm-all-norms-on-rn-are-equivalent]] the same
  limits are obtained from any other norm, so the notion does not depend on the
  choice ([[def-p-norms-on-rn]], [[def-euclidean-inner-product]]). The integral
  is defined coordinatewise and mentions no metric at all.

- **Integrability of $\lVert f\rVert_2$ is a separate matter** and is not part of
  this definition: it is proved, together with the inequality it belongs to, in
  [[thm-norm-inequality-for-the-vector-valued-integral]].

1. **Fundamental theorem, second part, in $\mathbb{R}^{m}$.** Let
   $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$ be differentiable at every point of $[a,b]$ as
   a function on $[a,b]$ ([[def-vector-valued-derivative-and-integral]]), and
   suppose $f' : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$ is integrable. Then
   $$\int_a^b f' \;=\; f(b) - f(a).$$
2. **A bounded derivative gives a Lipschitz function.** Let
   $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$ be continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable at
   every point of $(a,b)$, and let $M \ge 0$ satisfy
   $\lVert f'(t)\rVert_2 \le M$ for every $t \in (a,b)$. Then
   $$\lVert f(t) - f(s)\rVert_2 \;\le\; M\,|t-s| \qquad \text{for all } s,t \in [a,b],$$
   that is, $f$ is Lipschitz with constant $M$ as a map
   $([a,b], d_{\mathbb{R}}) \to (\mathbb{R}^{m}, d_2)$
   ([[def-lipschitz-holder-contraction]], [[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]],
   [[lem-metrics-on-rn]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural $m \ge 1$, reals $a < b$, and a function $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$ with the hypotheses of the clause under discussion; points $s, t \in [a,b]$.

[L1] The vector-valued derivative and integral are componentwise: $f'(c)_i = f_i'(c)$, and $f$ is integrable exactly when every $f_i$ is, with $\bigl(\int_a^b f\bigr)_i = \int_a^b f_i$; equality of two elements of $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ is equality of all their coordinates ([[def-vector-valued-derivative-and-integral]], [[thm-componentwise-limits-and-continuity]]).

[L2] The second fundamental theorem: if $G$ is differentiable on $[a,b]$ with $G' = g$ and $g$ is integrable on $[a,b]$, then $\int_a^b g = G(b)-G(a)$ ([[thm-ftc-second-part]], [[def-derivative]]).

[L3] The mean value inequality on a subinterval ([[thm-mean-value-inequality]]): for $s<t$, $f$ continuous on $[s,t]$ and differentiable on $(s,t)$ with $\lVert f'\rVert_2 \le M$ there, $\lVert f(t)-f(s)\rVert_2 \le M(t-s)$.

[L4] Restricting the domain of a function preserves a limit and its value, the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ condition then quantifying over fewer points; in particular if $f$ is differentiable at $c$ as a function on $[a,b]$ and $c$ is a limit point of $[s,t] \subseteq [a,b]$, then the restriction of $f$ to $[s,t]$ is differentiable at $c$ with the same derivative ([[def-function-limit]], [[def-vector-valued-functions-limits-and-continuity]], [[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L5] Norms and the induced metric: $\lVert w\rVert_2 \ge 0$, $\lVert -w\rVert_2 = \lVert w\rVert_2$, and $d_2(u,w) = \lVert u-w\rVert_2$ ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]], [[def-p-norms-on-rn]], [[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]]); $d_{\mathbb{R}}(s,t) = |s-t|$ and $|t-s| = |s-t|$ ([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L6] Lipschitz maps: $f$ is Lipschitz with constant $L \ge 0$ when $d_Y(f(x),f(x')) \le L\,d_X(x,x')$ for all $x,x'$ ([[def-lipschitz-holder-contraction]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Under the hypotheses of clause 1, each component $f_i$ is differentiable at every point of $[a,b]$ with derivative $f_i' = (f')_i$, and each $(f')_i$ is integrable on $[a,b]$. [L1]

1.2 Under the hypotheses of clause 2, if $s < t$ in $[a,b]$ then $f$ restricted to $[s,t]$ is continuous on $[s,t]$ and differentiable at every point of $(s,t)$ with the same derivative, since $(s,t) \subseteq (a,b)$ and every point of $(s,t)$ is a limit point of $[s,t]$. [L4]

2.1 Applying [L2] to $G := f_i$ and $g := (f')_i$ gives $\int_a^b (f')_i = f_i(b)-f_i(a)$ for every $i<m$. [step 1.1, L2]

2.2 Under the hypotheses of clause 2, for $s<t$ in $[a,b]$ the mean value inequality applies on $[s,t]$ and gives $\lVert f(t)-f(s)\rVert_2 \le M(t-s) = M|t-s|$. [step 1.2, L3, L5]

3.1 The $i$-th coordinate of $\int_a^b f'$ is $\int_a^b (f')_i$ and the $i$-th coordinate of $f(b)-f(a)$ is $f_i(b)-f_i(a)$; by step 2.1 these agree for every $i<m$, so the two vectors are equal, which is clause 1. [step 2.1, L1]

3.2 If $s = t$ then $\lVert f(t)-f(s)\rVert_2 = 0 = M|t-s|$; and if $t < s$ then step 2.2 applied with the roles exchanged gives $\lVert f(s)-f(t)\rVert_2 \le M|s-t|$, and $\lVert f(t)-f(s)\rVert_2 = \lVert -(f(s)-f(t))\rVert_2 = \lVert f(s)-f(t)\rVert_2$ while $|s-t| = |t-s|$. [step 2.2, L5]

4.1 Steps 2.2 and 3.2 cover all pairs $s,t \in [a,b]$, so $\lVert f(t)-f(s)\rVert_2 \le M|t-s|$ always; since $d_2(f(t),f(s)) = \lVert f(t)-f(s)\rVert_2$ and $d_{\mathbb{R}}(t,s) = |t-s|$, this is exactly the Lipschitz condition with constant $M \ge 0$, which is clause 2. [step 2.2, step 3.2, L5, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- **Two routes to the mean value inequality, and why the other one was taken.** When $f'$ happens to be integrable, clause 1 together with [[thm-norm-inequality-for-the-vector-valued-integral]] gives $$\lVert f(b)-f(a)\rVert_2 = \Bigl\lVert\int_a^b f'\Bigr\rVert_2 \le \int_a^b \lVert f'\rVert_2 \le M(b-a),$$ the last step by monotonicity of the integral. That is a second proof of [[thm-mean-value-inequality]] **under an extra hypothesis**. The theorem is proved the other way, from the scalar mean value theorem, precisely because it then needs no integrability at all: it applies to every differentiable $f$. The point is not academic — the companion page's witness for the failure of the equality form is differentiable and is nowhere assumed integrable.

- **When is $f'$ integrable?** Continuity of $f'$ suffices, each component being then continuous and hence integrable, which is the classical form of clause 1 and is what [[cor-primitives-of-a-continuous-function]] supplies for the scalar case. Clause 1 as stated is stronger: it asks only for integrability, exactly as [[thm-ftc-second-part]] does.

- **The scalar case of clause 2 is already published** as [[cor-bounded-derivative-implies-lipschitz]], for a function on an order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$. Clause 2 is its $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ analogue on a closed bounded interval, and it is proved from the vector mean value inequality rather than by applying the scalar statement coordinatewise, which would give the worse constant $\iota(m)\,M$.

- **Additivity is not needed above but is available**, so that clause 1 may be applied on any subinterval and the pieces reassembled ([[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]], [[def-oriented-integral]]).

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ denotes the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a subset of it.

The notions **upper bound** and **bounded above** are already fixed by
[[def-complete-ordered-field]] and are only recalled here, never redefined:
$u \in \mathbb{R}$ is an *upper bound* of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$, and
$S$ is *bounded above* if it has at least one upper bound. The dual notions are:

- $\ell \in \mathbb{R}$ is a **lower bound** of $S$ if $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.
- $S$ is **bounded below** if it has at least one lower bound.
- $S$ is **bounded** if it is both bounded above and bounded below, that is, if
  there are $\ell, u \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\ell \le s \le u$ for every $s \in S$.

## Remarks

- A bound is an element of $\mathbb{R}$ and is not required to lie in $S$. A
  bound that does lie in $S$ is a maximum or a minimum ([[def-max-min]]), and
  that is a strictly stronger condition ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Bounds come in half-lines: if $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$ then so is every
  $\ell'' \le \ell$, and if $u$ is an upper bound then so is every $u'' \ge u$.
  Consequently a set that has one bound of a given kind has infinitely many, and
  the interesting question is whether the collection of them has a best element,
  which is what a supremum ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) or an infimum
  ([[def-infimum]]) is.
- Bounded above and bounded below are independent conditions. The set
  $A = \{\, n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} : n \ge 1 \,\}$ of canonical naturals of
  $\mathbb{R}$ is bounded below by $0$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]) and is not
  bounded above ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); its reflection $-A$ is bounded above
  and not bounded below ([[lem-reflection]]).
- The empty set is bounded, and vacuously so: every real number is both an upper
  bound and a lower bound of $\emptyset$, since the defining condition quantifies
  over no elements. Having bounds is therefore much weaker than having a least
  upper bound or a greatest lower bound ([[fs-every-set-has-sup]]).

## Definition

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]). Write $\mathcal{P}$ for the set of all partitions of
$[a,b]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]) and put

$$\mathcal{L} \;:=\; \{\, L(f,P) \ : \ P \in \mathcal{P} \,\}, \qquad \mathcal{U} \;:=\; \{\, U(f,P) \ : \ P \in \mathcal{P} \,\}$$

for the sets of lower and of upper Darboux sums ([[def-darboux-sums]]).

### Both extrema exist

**$\mathcal{P}$ is nonempty**: the pair $(1, t)$ with $t_0 := a$ and $t_k := b$
for $k \ge 1$ is a partition of $[a,b]$, since $a < b$. So $\mathcal{L}$ and
$\mathcal{U}$ are nonempty.

**$\mathcal{L}$ is bounded above and $\mathcal{U}$ is bounded below.** Fix any
$Q \in \mathcal{P}$. By claim 2 of [[lem-refinement-inequalities]],
$L(f,P) \le U(f,Q)$ for every $P \in \mathcal{P}$, so $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound
of $\mathcal{L}$; and $L(f,Q) \le U(f,P)$ for every $P$, so $L(f,Q)$ is a lower
bound of $\mathcal{U}$.

Hence a nonempty set bounded above has a supremum
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and a nonempty set bounded below has an infimum
([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]), each unique ([[lem-sup-unique]]).
The **lower** and **upper Darboux integrals** of $f$ over $[a,b]$ are the real
numbers

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;:=\; \sup \mathcal{L} \;=\; \sup_{P} L(f,P), \qquad \overline{\int_a^b} f \;:=\; \inf \mathcal{U} \;=\; \inf_{P} U(f,P) .$$

### The lower integral never exceeds the upper one

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f .$$

Indeed, for each fixed $Q \in \mathcal{P}$ the number $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound
of $\mathcal{L}$, so the least upper bound satisfies
$\underline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,Q)$. As $Q$ was arbitrary, $\underline{\int_a^b}f$
is a lower bound of $\mathcal{U}$, and the greatest lower bound satisfies
$\underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f$ ([[def-infimum]]).

Moreover, for **every** partition $P$,

$$L(f,P) \;\le\; \underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; U(f,P) ,$$

the outer inequalities because a member of a set is at most its supremum and at
least its infimum.

### Integrability

$f$ is **Darboux integrable on $[a,b]$**, and on this page simply
**integrable**, when

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;=\; \overline{\int_a^b} f ,$$

and then the common value is written

$$\int_a^b f \qquad \text{or} \qquad \int_a^b f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x ,$$

the **integral of $f$ over $[a,b]$**. It is a single well-determined real
number, being the common value of two numbers each of which is unique
([[lem-sup-unique]]). Without the displayed equality the symbol $\int_a^b f$ is
not defined and is never written.

**The inequality above is the whole difficulty.** By the previous paragraph
integrability is *never* a question of one integral exceeding the other, only of
the gap $\overline{\int_a^b} f - \underline{\int_a^b} f \ge 0$ being $0$; and by
[[thm-riemann-criterion]] that gap is $0$ exactly when a single partition can be
found making $U(f,P) - L(f,P)$ small. Whether that is possible is settled
completely, in terms of the discontinuities of $f$, by
[[thm-lebesgue-criterion]].

**"Riemann integrable" means the same thing here.** The definition above is
Darboux's. Riemann's own definition, in terms of tagged partitions of small
mesh, is [[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]], and the two define the same
class of functions with the same integral by [[thm-darboux-equals-riemann]].
Until that theorem is proved the two phrases are kept apart; after it they are
used interchangeably, as they are throughout the literature.

## Remarks

- **The supremum is over all partitions, and nothing is selected.** Both
  $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{U}$ are sets determined by $f$ and $[a,b]$ alone,
  and $\sup$ and $\inf$ are canonical, so no choice principle is involved in
  forming either integral. Where a choice does enter on this page is recorded in
  [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].

- **Why the lower integral is a supremum and not an infimum.** Refining a
  partition can only increase a lower sum and decrease an upper sum
  ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]]), so the lower sums push up towards the
  integral and the upper sums push down towards it. Taking $\inf \mathcal{L}$
  would return the sum over the coarsest partition and would carry no
  information about $f$ beyond its infimum on $[a,b]$.

- **A bounded $f$ always has both integrals; only their equality can fail.** The
  Dirichlet function on $[0,1]$ has lower integral $0$ and upper integral $1$
  ([[fs-bounded-implies-riemann-integrable]]), which is the standard witness that
  the definition above is not vacuous in either direction.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), neighbourhoods are those of
[[def-neighbourhood-r]] and limit points those of [[def-limit-point-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$ be a
**limit point of $A$**. The **difference quotient of $f$ at $c$** is the function

$$q_{f,c} : A \setminus \{c\} \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad q_{f,c}(x) := \frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c} .$$

The division is legitimate at every point of the domain, since $x \ne c$ gives
$x - c \ne 0$.

**The point $c$ is a limit point of $A \setminus \{c\}$, not merely of $A$.**
For every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the punctured neighbourhood
$N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c)$ omits $c$, so

$$N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c) \cap A \;=\; N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c) \cap (A \setminus \{c\}) ,$$

and the left-hand side is nonempty because $c$ is a limit point of $A$. So
$q_{f,c}$ is a function on a set having $c$ as a limit point, and
$\lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x)$ is a notion that [[def-function-limit]] defines.

$f$ is **differentiable at $c$** when that limit exists, and then the
**derivative of $f$ at $c$** is

$$f'(c) \;:=\; \lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x) \;=\; \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c} .$$

**Two obligations are carried by that notation, and both are discharged here.**

1. **Uniqueness.** Writing $f'(c)$ treats the right-hand side as a name for a
   single real number. That is legitimate: $c$ is a limit point of the domain
   $A \setminus \{c\}$ of $q_{f,c}$, so at most one real can satisfy the
   $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ condition, by [[lem-function-limit-unique]] applied to
   $q_{f,c}$. Two reals both meeting the condition are therefore equal, and the
   symbol denotes.
2. **Meaningfulness.** The hypothesis that $c$ is a limit point of $A$ is not
   decoration. At an **isolated** point of $A$ the punctured condition
   $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ is met by no point of the domain at all, so the
   $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula is satisfied vacuously by *every* real at
   once; this is why [[def-function-limit]] leaves the limit undefined there,
   and it is why this library defines $f'(c)$ only at a limit point of $A$. At
   an isolated point of its domain a function is neither differentiable nor
   non-differentiable here: the question is not posed.

**The limit sees only $A \setminus \{c\}$, so how the difference quotient is
extended to $c$ is irrelevant.** Let $Q : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agree with
$q_{f,c}$ at every point of $A \setminus \{c\}$, and let $L \in \mathbb{R}$.
Then $\lim_{x \to c} Q(x) = L$ if and only if $\lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x) = L$.
Both conditions read: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ such that every point $x$ of the relevant domain with
$0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|{\cdot} - L| < \varepsilon$
([[def-function-limit]]). The clause $0 < |x - c|$ removes $x = c$ from both
quantifiers, so in both cases the points quantified over are exactly the
$x \in A \setminus \{c\}$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, at which $Q$ and
$q_{f,c}$ take the same value. The two conditions are the same condition.

**Differentiability on a set.** For $S \subseteq A$, $f$ is **differentiable on
$S$** when it is differentiable at every $c \in S$; implicit in that phrase is
that every point of $S$ is a limit point of $A$. $f$ is **differentiable** when
it is differentiable on the whole of $A$.

**Restriction of the domain.** Let $B \subseteq A$, let $c \in B$ and suppose
$c$ is a limit point of $B$. If $f$ is differentiable at $c$, then so is the
restriction $f|_B : B \to \mathbb{R}$, and

$$(f|_B)'(c) \;=\; f'(c) .$$

Indeed $B \setminus \{c\} \subseteq A \setminus \{c\}$; the displayed identity
of punctured neighbourhoods above, applied to $B$, shows that $c$ is a limit
point of $B \setminus \{c\}$; the difference quotient $q_{f|_B, c}$ is the
restriction of $q_{f,c}$ to $B \setminus \{c\}$, since $f|_B(c) = f(c)$; and
claim 2 of [[lem-limit-is-local]] carries the limit to that restriction.

**Every point of a nondegenerate interval is a limit point of it.** Let
$J \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be order-convex ([[def-interval]]) with at least two
elements and let $p \in J$. Choose $q \in J$ with $q \ne p$, and let a real
$\varepsilon > 0$ be given. If $p < q$, put $y := p + \tfrac{1}{2}\min\{\varepsilon,\ q - p\}$;
then $p < y$, and $y - p \le \tfrac{1}{2}(q-p) < q - p$, so $p < y < q$ and
order-convexity gives $y \in J$, while $0 < |y - p| < \varepsilon$. If $q < p$,
the point $y := p - \tfrac{1}{2}\min\{\varepsilon,\ p - q\}$ serves in the same
way. So $N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(p) \cap J \ne \varnothing$ for every real
$\varepsilon > 0$, that is, $p$ is a limit point of $J$
([[def-limit-point-r]]).

Consequently, for $f$ defined on a nondegenerate interval $I$, the symbol
$f'(c)$ is meaningful at **every** $c \in I$, endpoints included. At an endpoint
the difference quotient is taken over the points of $I$ lying on the one side
that is available, so what other texts call a one-sided derivative is, here,
simply the derivative of $f$ on $I$.

## Remarks

- **Notation.** $f'(c)$ and $\frac{df}{dx}(c)$ denote the same real number, and
  this library uses the first. Neither is an operation performed on a symbol
  $x$: the variable in the second is a name for the argument and nothing more.

- **Differentiability is a property of the pair $(f, A)$ at $c$, not of $f$
  alone.** The restriction clause above goes in one direction only, and the
  converse fails. Take $A := \mathbb{R}$, $f(x) := |x|$, $B := [0,\infty)$ and
  $c := 0$. Then $f|_B$ is the identity on $B$, whose difference quotient at $0$
  is constantly $1$, so $f|_B$ is differentiable at $0$ with derivative $1$;

  is a condition on $f$ near $c$ that does not mention a quotient, and it is

## Definition

Let $V$ be a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-vector-space]]) and let $M$
and $N$ be norms on $V$ ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]). $M$ and $N$ are
**equivalent** when there are reals $c > 0$ and $C > 0$ with

$$c\,M(v) \;\le\; N(v) \;\le\; C\,M(v) \qquad \text{for every } v \in V .$$

The constants are not part of the data and are not unique: any smaller $c$ and
any larger $C$ serve as well.

### This is an equivalence relation on the norms on $V$

- **Reflexive:** take $c = C = 1$.
- **Symmetric:** from $cM \le N \le CM$ and $c, C > 0$ one gets
  $C^{-1}N \le M \le c^{-1}N$, dividing by the positive constants
  ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).
- **Transitive:** if $cM \le N \le CM$ and $c'N \le P \le C'N$ then
  $c'c\,M \le P \le C'C\,M$, and $c'c > 0$, $C'C > 0$, a product of positives
  being positive.

### The dictionary with equivalent metrics

Let $d_M(u,v) = M(u-v)$ and $d_N(u,v) = N(u-v)$ be the induced metrics
([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]). Substituting $v := u - w$ in the displayed
condition gives

$$c\,d_M(u,w) \;\le\; d_N(u,w) \;\le\; C\,d_M(u,w) \qquad \text{for all } u, w \in V ,$$

which is **verbatim the Lipschitz equivalence** of $d_M$ and $d_N$ in the sense
of [[def-equivalent-metrics]], with $\alpha = c$ and $\beta = C$. That is the
**strongest** of the three tiers that item distinguishes: by
[[thm-metric-equivalence-hierarchy]], Lipschitz equivalence implies uniform
equivalence, which implies topological equivalence. So equivalent norms give

- the same open sets, hence the same closed sets, closures and interiors
  ([[def-metric-topology]]);
- the same uniformly continuous maps into and out of $V$
  ([[def-metric-uniform-continuity]]);
- the same convergent sequences with the same limits, and the same Cauchy
  sequences ([[def-metric-convergence]], [[def-cauchy-in-metric]]).

The last line deserves its two-line verification, since it is used constantly
below and is not literally a clause of [[thm-metric-equivalence-hierarchy]]. If
$d_M(v_k, v) \to 0$ then $0 \le d_N(v_k,v) \le C\,d_M(v_k,v)$, so given a
rational $\varepsilon > 0$ an index beyond which $d_M(v_k,v) < \varepsilon/C$
serves for $d_N$; the converse uses $d_M \le c^{-1}d_N$ in the same way. The
Cauchy statement is the same estimate applied to $d_N(v_k,v_l)$. In particular
$(V, d_M)$ is complete if and only if $(V,d_N)$ is.

**Naming.** Many texts say *strongly equivalent* for what
[[def-equivalent-metrics]] calls Lipschitz equivalent, and simply *equivalent*
for what it calls topologically equivalent. As there, this library always writes
the qualifier for metrics. For **norms** there is no fork to guard against: the
condition displayed above is the only one anyone calls equivalence of norms, and
it is always the Lipschitz-strength one.

## Remarks

- **The converse of the dictionary fails.** A metric on $V$ that is equivalent to
  a norm metric need not itself come from a norm: [[lem-bounded-remetrisation]]
  turns any metric $d$ into $d' = \min\{d,1\}$, uniformly equivalent to $d$ and
  bounded, and a bounded metric on a nonzero vector space is not induced by any
  norm, since absolute homogeneity would make $d'(\lambda v, 0)$ unbounded in
  $\lambda$ ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]). So "equivalent to a norm metric" is
  strictly weaker than "induced by an equivalent norm".

- **Equivalence is a statement about a fixed vector space.** Two norms on
  different spaces are never compared. On $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with $n \ge 1$ the
  norms $\lVert\cdot\rVert_1$, $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ and
  $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ of [[def-p-norms-on-rn]] are equivalent, with
  explicit constants proved in
  [[lem-every-norm-on-rn-is-continuous-for-the-euclidean-metric]]; that every
  pair of norms on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is equivalent is
  [[thm-all-norms-on-rn-are-equivalent]]. Neither statement survives to spaces
  that are not finite-dimensional, and the companion page carries the witness.

- **Equivalence says nothing about the geometry.** Equivalent norms have the same
  convergent sequences and the same open sets; they may still have quite
  different unit balls, and one of them may come from an inner product while the
  other does not. [[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]]
  records the metric identifications and nothing more.

## Definition

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. A natural number is a von Neumann natural, that is a set,
and $n = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]],
[[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]), so

$$\mathbb{R}^{n} \;=\; \{\, x \;:\; x \text{ is a function } n \to \mathbb{R} \,\}$$

is the function space of [[def-function-space]] at $F = \mathbb{R}$ and $X = n$,
a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ under the pointwise operations
([[def-vector-space]]). We write $x_k := x(k)$ for $k < n$, and two elements of
$\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are equal exactly when they agree at every $k < n$. This is the
same set that [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] calls $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.

The **Euclidean inner product** of $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the real number

$$\langle x, y\rangle \;:=\; \sum_{k<n} x_k\,y_k ,$$

the finite sum of [[def-finite-sum]] applied to the list $k \mapsto x_k y_k$
(extended by $0$ beyond $n$, as every finite list in this library is). The
**Euclidean norm** of $x$ is

$$\lVert x\rVert_2 \;:=\; \sqrt{\langle x, x\rangle},$$

which is defined because $\langle x,x\rangle = \sum_{k<n} x_k^{2} \ge 0$ (a sum
of nonnegative terms, [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 4 and
[[lem-of-square-positive]], the case $x_k = 0$ giving $x_k^2 = 0$ by
[[def-integer-power]]) and every nonnegative real has a unique nonnegative square
root ([[thm-of-square-roots]]).

### Both are defined for every $n$, including $n = 0$

At $n = 0$ the set $\mathbb{R}^{0}$ has exactly one element, the empty function,
and it is the zero vector space ([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]] clause 5); the sum
above is the empty sum, so $\langle x,y\rangle = 0$ and $\lVert x\rVert_2 = 0$.
**This is the first place on this page where the two index regimes diverge, and
the divergence is deliberate.** The published metrics $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_\infty$ of
[[lem-metrics-on-rn]] are defined only for $n \ge 1$, because $d_\infty$ would
otherwise be a maximum over the empty index set; the algebra above needs no such
restriction. The boundary in this page runs between the algebra and the metric,
not where a reader would guess, and [[rem-rn-conventions-and-scope]] lists
exactly which items inherit $n \ge 1$.

### The algebra of the inner product

For all $x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$:

1. **Symmetry.** $\langle x,y\rangle = \langle y,x\rangle$, since $x_ky_k = y_kx_k$
   termwise.
2. **Additivity in the first argument.**
   $\langle x + y, z\rangle = \langle x,z\rangle + \langle y,z\rangle$: the list
   $k \mapsto (x_k+y_k)z_k$ is the termwise sum of $k \mapsto x_kz_k$ and
   $k \mapsto y_kz_k$, so [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 1 applies.
3. **Homogeneity in the first argument.**
   $\langle \lambda x, y\rangle = \lambda\langle x,y\rangle$, by
   [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 2.
4. **Bilinearity.** Clauses 2 and 3 together with symmetry give the same two laws
   in the second argument.
5. **Positive definiteness.** $\langle x,x\rangle \ge 0$, and
   $\langle x,x\rangle = 0$ if and only if $x = 0$. Indeed a vanishing sum of
   nonnegative terms has every term $0$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 4), so
   $x_k^{2} = 0$ for every $k < n$, and a nonzero real has a positive square
   ([[lem-of-square-positive]]), whence $x_k = 0$ for every $k < n$ and $x = 0$.
6. **Agreement with the published Euclidean metric.** For $n \ge 1$ and
   $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$,
   $\lVert x - y\rVert_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}(x_k-y_k)^{2}} = d_2(x,y)$, the two
   sides being the same expression ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]]). In particular
   $\lVert x\rVert_2 = d_2(x, 0)$.

That $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ is a norm in the sense of [[def-norm-and-normed-space]]
is proved in [[thm-cauchy-schwarz-and-the-euclidean-norm]], where the triangle
inequality is obtained from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality; it is not assumed
here.

## Remarks

- **Scope: the concrete form only.** What is defined above is the Euclidean inner
  product on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and nothing more. The general theory of inner
  product spaces — abstract inner products, orthonormal bases, Gram-Schmidt,
  orthogonal projection and orthogonal complements of arbitrary subspaces — is
  planned for a page of this library that comes **earlier in the plan order** and
  is not yet built. No item on this page claims anything about abstract inner
  product spaces, and no item on this page introduces the general notion.

- **The standard basis and coordinates.** For $i < n$ the standard unit vector
  $e_i \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ has $e_i(i) = 1$ and $e_i(j) = 0$ for $j \ne i$
  ([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]]). Then $\langle x, e_i\rangle = x_i$: the list
  $k \mapsto x_k (e_i)_k$ vanishes except at $k = i$, where its value is $x_i$,
  and a list vanishing off one index sums to its value there
  ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 3, splitting the range at $i$). So the
  coordinates of $x$ are recovered by testing against the standard basis, which
  is the form used repeatedly below.

- **Powers here are integer powers.** $x_k^{2}$ means the integer power of
  [[def-integer-power]], and $\lVert x\rVert_2^{2} = \langle x,x\rangle$ by
  [[thm-of-square-roots]] and [[lem-power-laws]].

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) with its order and absolute value
([[def-real-order]]).

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$, let $c \in \mathbb{R}$
be a **limit point** of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and let $L \in \mathbb{R}$.
We say that **$f(x)$ tends to $L$ as $x$ tends to $c$**, and write

$$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L ,$$

when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ 0 < |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - L| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

where $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ range over the **positive reals**.

In the language of neighbourhoods ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]) the condition reads:
for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ with

$$f\bigl(A \cap N^{*}_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \;\subseteq\; N_{\varepsilon}(L),$$

$N^{*}_{\delta}(c) = \{\, y : 0 < |y - c| < \delta \,\}$ being the punctured
$\delta$-neighbourhood of $c$ and $N_{\varepsilon}(L) = (L - \varepsilon,\ L +
\varepsilon)$ the open interval of [[def-interval]]. The two forms agree because
$|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ says exactly $f(x) \in N_\varepsilon(L)$, and
$0 < |x - c| < \delta$ says exactly $x \in N^{*}_\delta(c)$.

**Three features of this definition are load bearing, not decoration.**

1. **$c$ is required to be a limit point of $A$.** By [[def-limit-point-r]] that
   says every punctured neighbourhood of $c$ meets $A$, so for every $\delta > 0$
   the set $A \cap N^{*}_\delta(c)$ over which the implication quantifies is
   nonempty. Drop the requirement and the implication can be satisfied
   vacuously by *every* real $L$ at once, which is exactly what
   [[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]] records. At a point of $A$
   that is not a limit point of $A$ — an isolated point — the symbol
   $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ is therefore **not defined** in this library.

2. **$c \in A$ is not required.** A limit point of $A$ need not belong to $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and the definition never evaluates $f$ at $c$. This
   is what allows a limit to be taken at a point where the function is not
   defined at all, as at $0$ for $x \mapsto x\,\psi(1/x)$.

3. **The value $f(c)$, when it exists, is irrelevant.** The hypothesis
   $0 < |x - c|$ excludes $x = c$ from the quantifier, so changing $f$ at the
   single point $c$ changes nothing. Equality of the limit with the value is an
   extra condition, not a consequence: [[fs-limit-equals-value]].

**The notation presumes uniqueness.** Writing $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$ treats
the left-hand side as a name for a single real number, which is legitimate only
because at a limit point at most one $L$ can satisfy the displayed condition.
That obligation is discharged by [[lem-function-limit-unique]], recorded in this
item's `justified_by`. As with $\sup S$ ([[rem-sup-conventions]]) and
$\lim_k x_k$ ([[lem-limit-unique]]), the symbol is written only for a function
already known to have a limit at $c$.

**Real and rational $\varepsilon$ define the same relation.** Above,
$\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ range over the positive reals. Restricting either
quantifier to the positive rationals gives the same relation: every positive
rational is a positive real, and below every positive real lies a positive
rational ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), so an $\varepsilon$-condition verified for
all positive rationals is verified for an arbitrary positive real $\eta$ by
running it at a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, and a
$\delta$ produced as a real may be shrunk to a rational one below it. This is
the passage sanctioned in the remarks of [[def-sequence]], and it is what lets
this definition be compared with [[def-real-limit]], whose $\varepsilon$ is
rational, in [[thm-sequential-criterion-for-function-limits]].

## Remarks

- **Terminology.** *Limit point* here is a property of the set $A$ and the point
  $c$, in the sense of [[def-limit-point-r]]; it has nothing to do with
  subsequential limits ([[def-subsequential-limit]]), and the distinction is the
  one that item records.

- **Why the punctured condition, and not $|x - c| < \delta$.** With the
  unpunctured condition the definition would force $f$ to be defined at $c$ and
  would force $|f(c) - L| < \varepsilon$ for every $\varepsilon$, that is,
  $L = f(c)$. The resulting notion is continuity at $c$, a strictly stronger
  condition, and conflating the two is the error catalogued in
  [[fs-limit-equals-value]].

- **One-sided and infinite variants.** Restricting the domain to one side of $c$
  gives the one-sided limits of [[def-one-sided-limits]]; replacing the
  conditions on $x$ or on $f(x)$ by unboundedness conditions gives the limits at
  and to infinity of [[def-limits-at-infinity]]. Both are built on this
  definition rather than beside it.

## Definition

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]) and let $X$ be any set. Write

$$F^{X} \;:=\; \{\, f \;:\; f \text{ is a function } X \to F \,\},$$

and for $f \in F^{X}$ write $f(x)$ for its value at $x \in X$. Two elements of
$F^{X}$ are equal exactly when they agree at every point of $X$. Define

$$(f + g)(x) \;:=\; f(x) + g(x), \qquad (\lambda f)(x) \;:=\; \lambda\, f(x), \qquad 0_{F^{X}}(x) \;:=\; 0_F,$$

for $f, g \in F^{X}$, $\lambda \in F$ and $x \in X$, the operations on the right
being those of $F$. These are the **pointwise** operations.

**These rules really are the required data.** For $f, g \in F^{X}$ the assignment
$x \mapsto f(x) + g(x)$ is a function $X \to F$, so $+$ is a binary operation
$F^{X} \times F^{X} \to F^{X}$ ([[def-binary-operation]]); for $\lambda \in F$ and
$f \in F^{X}$ the assignment $x \mapsto \lambda f(x)$ is a function $X \to F$, so
scalar multiplication is a map $F \times F^{X} \to F^{X}$; and $0_{F^{X}}$, the
constant function at $0_F$, is an element of $F^{X}$.

**$F^{X}$ is a vector space over $F$** ([[def-vector-space]]). Each axiom is an
equation between elements of $F^{X}$, hence holds exactly when it holds at every
$x \in X$ after evaluation, and there it is the corresponding field axiom applied
to the values $f(x), g(x), \lambda, \mu$:

- associativity and commutativity of $+$, and $f + 0_{F^{X}} = f$, come from the
  same laws for $+$ in $F$; the additive inverse of $f$ is $x \mapsto -f(x)$,
  which lies in $F^{X}$ and satisfies $f + (-f) = 0_{F^{X}}$ pointwise. This is
  axiom (V1);
- $\bigl(\lambda(f+g)\bigr)(x) = \lambda(f(x)+g(x)) = \lambda f(x) + \lambda g(x)$
  is (V2), by distributivity in $F$;
- $\bigl((\lambda+\mu)f\bigr)(x) = (\lambda+\mu)f(x) = \lambda f(x) + \mu f(x)$ is
  (V3), by distributivity in $F$;
- $\bigl((\lambda\mu)f\bigr)(x) = (\lambda\mu)f(x) = \lambda(\mu f(x))$ is (V4),
  by associativity of multiplication in $F$;
- $(1_F f)(x) = 1_F f(x) = f(x)$ is (V5), by the multiplicative identity law
  in $F$.

### The case $X = n$

A natural number is a von Neumann natural ([[def-natural-numbers]]), that is a
set, and $n = \{\, m \in \mathbb{N} : m < n \,\} = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$
([[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]). Taking $X = n$ therefore gives

$$F^{n} \;=\; \{\, x \;:\; x \text{ is a function } n \to F \,\},$$

whose elements are written $x = (x_0, x_1, \dots, x_{n-1})$ with $x_i := x(i)$ for
$i < n$. **The coordinates are indexed from $0$**, because $0 \in n$ whenever
$n \ne 0$ and $n \notin n$ always. The operations read

$$(x + y)_i = x_i + y_i, \qquad (\lambda x)_i = \lambda x_i \qquad (i < n),$$

and the zero of $F^{n}$ is the tuple all of whose coordinates are $0_F$.

**The two boundary cases.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$, so $n = 0$ is a genuine
case. Since $0 = \varnothing$, the set $F^{0} = F^{\varnothing}$ has exactly one
element, the empty function; that element is $0_{F^{0}}$, so $F^{0}$ is the
**zero space** $\{0_{F^{0}}\}$, not the empty set. For $n = 1$ we have
$1 = \{0\}$, and the map $F^{1} \to F$ sending $x$ to its single coordinate $x_0$
is a bijection satisfying $(x+y)_0 = x_0 + y_0$ and $(\lambda x)_0 = \lambda x_0$;
we use it to read $F^{1}$ as $F$ where convenient. (No general notion of
isomorphism of vector spaces is available on this page, and none is claimed here:
what is asserted is exactly the displayed bijection and the two displayed
equations.)

## Remarks

- **The same set $F^{X}$ also carries a ring structure, and the two must not be
  conflated.** For a ring $R$ and a set $X$, [[def-ring-of-functions]] equips the
  set $R^{X}$ of all functions $X \to R$ with pointwise addition and pointwise
  multiplication. Taking $R = F$, the underlying set is literally the same set
  $F^{X}$ as here, and **the addition is literally the same operation**,
  $(f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)$ in both. What differs is the second operation:

  | | second operation | type |
  |---|---|---|
  | ring of functions | $(fg)(x) = f(x)\,g(x)$ | $F^{X} \times F^{X} \to F^{X}$ |
  | vector space (here) | $(\lambda f)(x) = \lambda\, f(x)$ | $F \times F^{X} \to F^{X}$ |

  Neither is a special case of the other, since they do not even have the same
  domain: one multiplies two functions, the other multiplies a function by a
  scalar. They agree in the following sense, and this is the whole of the
  relation between them: for $\lambda \in F$ let $c_\lambda \in F^{X}$ be the
  constant function at $\lambda$; then $\lambda f$ and the ring product
  $c_\lambda f$ have the same value $\lambda f(x)$ at every $x$, so they are
  equal. Both structures are present on $F^{X}$ at once, and nothing on this page
  uses the ring product.

- **Why $F^{n}$ is defined this way rather than as "$n$-tuples".** An $n$-tuple is
  already a function on an index set, and taking that index set to be the natural
  number $n$ itself makes the coordinates, the finite sums of
  [[def-monoid-finite-product]] and the induction arguments below all run over the
  same object. The price is that every index starts at $0$, and that $F^{0}$ is a
  one-element space; both are recorded above so that no statement on this page or
  its companion is quietly restricted to $n \ge 1$.

- **$X$ is arbitrary.** Nothing above assumes $X$ finite, countable, or nonempty.
  The case $X = \mathbb{N}$ gives the space of all families of scalars indexed by
  $\mathbb{N}$, and the case $X = m \times n$ gives the matrices of
  [[def-matrix-space]].

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]] and closure as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]].

- $x$ is an **adherent point** of $A$ when $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne
  \varnothing$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$.
- $x$ is a **limit point** (or *accumulation point*) of $A$ when
  $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every real
  $\varepsilon > 0$: every punctured neighbourhood of $x$ meets $A$.
- $x$ is an **isolated point** of $A$ when $x \in A$ and there is a real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$.
- The **derived set** of $A$ is
  $$A' \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \text{ is a limit point of } A \,\}.$$
- $A$ is **dense in $\mathbb{R}$** when $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$.

**A limit point is an adherent point**, since $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq
N_\varepsilon(x)$; and an element of $A$ is an adherent point of $A$, since
$x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). So the adherent
points of $A$ are exactly the points of $A \cup A'$, a statement proved as part
of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

**Limit point and isolated point are exact opposites inside $A$.** For
$x \in A$: $x$ is an isolated point of $A$ exactly when it is not a limit point
of $A$. Indeed $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$ says precisely that
$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, because $x$ itself always lies in
$N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ when $x \in A$; so the existence of an $\varepsilon$
witnessing isolation is the negation of the condition defining a limit point.
A point of $A$ is therefore either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$, and
never both.

**A limit point need not belong to the set, and a point of the set need not be a
limit point.** Both possibilities occur, and the two examples that matter later
are $0$, which is a limit point of $\{\, 1/k : k \ge 1 \,\}$ without belonging
to it, and $0$ again, which belongs to $\{0\} \cup [1,2]$ as an isolated point.

## Remarks

- **Terminology: *limit point* here is about a set, never about a sequence.**
  This library reserves *subsequential limit* for the sequential notion
  ([[def-subsequential-limit]]), and the two are genuinely different: the
  constant sequence $x_k = 0$ has $0$ as a subsequential limit, while its set of
  values $\{0\}$ has no limit point at all. The distinction is the one
  [[def-subsequential-limit]] records under "Terminology", and it is respected
  throughout this page.

- **Density is defined through the closure, not through intervals.** Saying
  $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$ is equivalent to saying that every nonempty open
  subset of $\mathbb{R}$ meets $A$, and also to saying that every neighbourhood
  of every real meets $A$; the equivalences follow from
  [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] and are used in that form in
  [[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]].

- **The derived set need not be comparable with the set.** It can be strictly
  larger, as for $\mathbb{Q}$: every punctured neighbourhood of any real
  contains a rational, since density supplies one strictly between $x$ and
  $x + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]), so the derived set of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is all of $\mathbb{R}$. It can be strictly smaller, as for
  $\{0\}$, whose derived set is empty; and it can be neither, as for
  $\{0\} \cup (1,2)$, whose derived set is $[1,2]$, a set containing points
  outside the original and omitting the point $0$ of it. A closed set satisfying
  $A \subseteq A'$ is called perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]).

## Definition

**Why this item is first.** The published definition of the integral does not
cover this page. [[def-darboux-integral]] is stated for reals $a < b$, because
the partitions it quantifies over are those of [[def-partition-and-refinement]],
whose standing hypothesis is $a < b$: with $a = b$ the chain
$a = t_0 < \dots < t_n = b$ is unsatisfiable. So $\int_a^b f$ is an undefined
symbol whenever $a \ge b$, and every additivity statement below would be
ill-formed as it is usually written. This item extends the notation, and nothing
else: the object it names is still the Darboux integral of
[[def-darboux-integral]].

Let $u, v \in \mathbb{R}$ and write

$$[u \wedge v,\ u \vee v] \;:=\; \text{the closed interval with endpoints } u \text{ and } v$$

([[def-interval]]). Let $f$ be a real-valued function whose domain contains that
interval. Say that **$f$ is integrable between $u$ and $v$** when either $u = v$,
or $u \ne v$ and the restriction of $f$ to $[u \wedge v,\ u \vee v]$ is bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]) and Darboux integrable there ([[def-darboux-integral]],
[[def-darboux-sums]]). For such $f$ define

$$\int_u^v f \;:=\; \begin{cases} \text{the Darboux integral of } f \text{ over } [u,v] & \text{if } u < v, \\[2pt] 0 & \text{if } u = v, \\[2pt] -\displaystyle\int_v^u f & \text{if } u > v. \end{cases}$$

**There is nothing to check for consistency.** The three clauses are indexed by
the three cases of trichotomy, $u < v$, $u = v$ and $u > v$, which are mutually
exclusive and exhaustive; no pair of them ever applies to the same $(u,v)$. In
particular the first clause is untouched, so on $u < v$ this is the published
integral verbatim and every published theorem about it applies unchanged.

**The middle clause is a stipulation, not a computation.** It is *not* claimed
that $0$ is a value forced by the $u < v$ definition in any limiting sense; that
definition simply says nothing at $u = v$, and $\int_u^u f := 0$ is what is
written there. It is also unconditional: no hypothesis on $f$ beyond being
defined at $u$ is asked for, since the case $u = v$ never refers to a partition.

### The two consequences used throughout the page

**Antisymmetry, for every pair.** For all reals $u, v$ with $f$ integrable
between them,

$$\int_u^v f \;=\; -\int_v^u f .$$

Indeed if $u < v$ then $v > u$ and the third clause reads
$\int_v^u f = -\int_u^v f$, which rearranges to the display; if $u = v$ both
sides are $0$; and if $u > v$ the third clause is the display itself.

**Absolute values agree.** Consequently
$\bigl|\int_u^v f\bigr| = \bigl|\int_v^u f\bigr|$ for every such pair.

**An obligation recorded here and discharged elsewhere.** With this convention
the additivity identity

$$\int_u^v f \;+\; \int_v^w f \;=\; \int_u^w f$$

holds for **every** arrangement of $u, v, w$ in an interval on which $f$ is
integrable, not only for $u < v < w$. That is a theorem and not part of this
definition; it is proved as the last clause of
[[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]], and nothing on this page uses it before it
is proved there.

## Remarks

- **This is notation, and it is a real notation.** Without it the substitution
  theorem could not be stated with the limits $\varphi(c)$ and $\varphi(d)$ in
  the order the map produces them, since a differentiable $\varphi$ need be
  neither injective nor monotone; and the integral function $x \mapsto \int_a^x f$
  would be undefined at $x = a$.

- **One published inequality is not orientation-invariant, and that is a trap.**
  The estimate $\bigl|\int_u^v f\bigr| \le \int_u^v |f|$ is guaranteed only
  for $u \le v$: at $u > v$ the right-hand side is $-\int_v^u |f| \le 0$ while
  the left-hand side is $\ge 0$, so the inequality fails whenever
  $\int_v^u |f| > 0$. The form valid for every pair is
  $\bigl|\int_u^v f\bigr| \le \bigl|\int_u^v |f|\bigr|$, and this is stated where
  it is proved ([[cor-integrability-of-absolute-values-products-and-lattice-operations]]).

- **Integrability is a property of the unordered pair.** By construction, $f$ is
  integrable between $u$ and $v$ if and only if it is integrable between $v$ and
  $u$, since both refer to the same closed interval; only the sign of the value
  remembers the order.

## Definition

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be the function space of
[[def-euclidean-inner-product]], with $x_k := x(k)$ for $k < n$.

### The $p$-norm, for a rational exponent $p \ge 1$

Let $p \in \mathbb{Q}$ with $p \ge 1$. For $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ put

$$\lVert x\rVert_p \;:=\; \Bigl(\sum_{k<n} |x_k|^{p}\Bigr)^{1/p},$$

where $|\cdot|$ is the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]), the sum is the finite
sum of [[def-finite-sum]], and both powers are the **rational** powers of
[[def-rational-power]].

**Every power written here is defined.** Each base $|x_k|$ is a nonnegative real
and $p > 0$, so $|x_k|^{p}$ is given by [[def-rational-power]] for $|x_k| > 0$
and by its supplementary clause $0^{p} = 0$ for $|x_k| = 0$; the sum of these
nonnegative terms is nonnegative ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 4), and
$1/p$ is a positive rational, so the outer power is defined for the same two
reasons. The value does not depend on which representative of $p$ or of $1/p$ is
used ([[lem-rational-power-well-defined]]).

**The exponent is a rational, and that is not a matter of taste.**
[[def-rational-power]] supplies $a^{r}$ for a nonnegative base and a **rational**
exponent only; real exponents do not exist at this point in the reading order,
and [[rem-real-exponents-deferred]] records exactly why. This is also why the
published Minkowski inequality [[thm-minkowski-finite]], which is what makes the
triangle inequality work below, is itself stated for rational $p \ge 1$. **No
statement on this page is written for $p$ ranging over a real interval.**

### The maximum norm

For $n \ge 1$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ put

$$\lVert x\rVert_\infty \;:=\; \max\{\, |x_k| \;:\; k < n \,\},$$

the maximum of a nonempty finite set of reals, which exists and is one of its
elements ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

**The hypothesis $n \ge 1$ is required and propagates.** At $n = 0$ the set
$\{|x_k| : k<n\}$ is empty and has no maximum ([[def-max-min]]). This is the same
restriction the published [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] carries, for the same reason, and
**every statement on this page that mentions $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ inherits
it**. The $p$-norms for rational $p \ge 1$ carry no such restriction: at $n = 0$
each is the empty sum raised to a positive rational power, hence $0$.

### The three cases the rest of the page uses

- $\lVert x\rVert_1 = \sum_{k<n}|x_k|$, since $t^{1} = t$ for $t \ge 0$
  ([[lem-rational-power-laws]], and $0^{1} = 0$ by the supplementary clause).
- $\lVert x\rVert_2 = \bigl(\sum_{k<n}|x_k|^{2}\bigr)^{1/2} = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}x_k^{2}}$,
  which is exactly the Euclidean norm of [[def-euclidean-inner-product]]: the
  exponent $2$ agrees with the integer power, so $|x_k|^{2} = x_k^{2}$
  ([[lem-of-abs-value]]), and $t^{1/2}$ is the unique nonnegative square root of
  $t$, which is $\sqrt{t}$ ([[def-rational-power]], [[thm-of-square-roots]]).
  **The two notations denote the same function and no second Euclidean norm is
  introduced.**
- $\lVert x\rVert_\infty$ as above, for $n \ge 1$.

That each of these is a norm in the sense of [[def-norm-and-normed-space]], and
that the metrics they induce are exactly the published $d_1$, $d_2$ and
$d_\infty$ of [[lem-metrics-on-rn]], is
[[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]]; it is proved there
and is not assumed here.

## Remarks

- **Why $p \ge 1$.** The triangle inequality for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$ is
  Minkowski's inequality, and [[thm-minkowski-finite]] is stated for rational
  $p \ge 1$. For $0 < p < 1$ the displayed expression is still defined but is not
  a norm on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n \ge 2$; nothing on this page asserts anything
  about that range, and the expression is never written with such an exponent.

- **Monotonicity in the base is what makes the comparisons below work.** For a
  fixed positive rational $r$ the map $a \mapsto a^{r}$ is strictly increasing on
  the positive reals ([[lem-rational-power-monotone]] clause 2), so an inequality
  between nonnegative sums passes through the outer power. That is the only
  property of rational powers used in the comparison chain of
  [[lem-every-norm-on-rn-is-continuous-for-the-euclidean-metric]].

- **The subscript $\infty$ is a name, not a number.** No arithmetic is performed
  with it, and $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ is not $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$ for any
  exponent; it is a separately defined function that happens to sit at the end of
  the family. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$ silently that
  [[def-interval]] records for the interval notation.

## Definition

Throughout, $m \in \mathbb{N}$ with $m \ge 1$, and $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ carries the
Euclidean norm $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ of [[def-euclidean-inner-product]] and
[[def-p-norms-on-rn]], whose induced metric is the published $d_2$
([[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]],
[[lem-metrics-on-rn]]). A function into $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ is called
**vector-valued**.

### Continuity

Let $(X, d_X)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]), let $A \subseteq X$
carry the restricted metric $d_A$ ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]), let
$f : A \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$ and let $a \in A$. Then $f$ is **continuous at $a$**
when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ d_X(x,a) < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ \lVert f(x) - f(a)\rVert_2 < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

with $\varepsilon, \delta$ ranging over the positive reals, and **continuous on
$A$** when it is continuous at every point of $A$.

**This is not a new notion, and that is the point of writing it down.** Since
$\lVert f(x)-f(a)\rVert_2 = d_2\bigl(f(x),f(a)\bigr)$ and $d_A$ is the
restriction of $d_X$, the displayed condition is **verbatim** the condition of
[[def-metric-continuity]] for the map of metric spaces
$f : (A,d_A) \to (\mathbb{R}^{m}, d_2)$. So every theorem about continuous maps
of metric spaces applies to vector-valued functions with no translation, and
this library has exactly one notion of continuity here. The same move was made
once before, between the $\mathbb{R}$-native and the metric notions, in
[[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]]; this item is that move one dimension up in
the codomain.

The two cases used below are $X = \mathbb{R}$ with $d_{\mathbb{R}}(s,t) = |s-t|$
([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]) and $X = \mathbb{R}^{n}$ with $d_2$, for
$n \ge 1$.

### Limits, for a real domain

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$, let $c$ be a limit
point of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]) and let $L \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$. We say
$f(x)$ **tends to $L$ as $x$ tends to $c$**, and write
$\lim_{x\to c} f(x) = L$, when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ 0 < |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ \lVert f(x) - L\rVert_2 < \varepsilon\ \bigr].$$

This is the condition of [[def-function-limit]] with the absolute value in the
codomain replaced by $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$; as there, the puncture $0 < |x-c|$ is
what makes $c$ a point the function need not be defined at, and the hypothesis
that $c$ is a limit point of $A$ is what stops the condition from being satisfied
vacuously.

**The notation denotes: at most one $L$ satisfies the condition.** Suppose $L$
and $L'$ both do and $L \ne L'$. Then $\varepsilon := \lVert L-L'\rVert_2 / 2 > 0$
by (N1) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]). Take $\delta$
and $\delta'$ for this $\varepsilon$ and put $\eta := \min\{\delta,\delta'\} > 0$.
Since $c$ is a limit point of $A$ there is $x \in A$ with $0 < |x-c| < \eta$
([[def-limit-point-r]]), and then

$$\lVert L - L'\rVert_2 \;\le\; \lVert L - f(x)\rVert_2 + \lVert f(x) - L'\rVert_2 \;<\; \varepsilon + \varepsilon \;=\; \lVert L-L'\rVert_2$$

by (N3) and (N2), which trichotomy forbids. So $L = L'$.

### Components

For $i < m$ define the $i$-th **coordinate projection**
$\pi_i : \mathbb{R}^{m} \to \mathbb{R}$ by $\pi_i(y) := y_i = y(i)$, and for
$f : A \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$ the $i$-th **component** $f_i := \pi_i \circ f$, a
real-valued function on $A$.

**Each $\pi_i$ is $1$-Lipschitz** ([[def-lipschitz-holder-contraction]]): for
$y, z \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$,

$$\bigl|\pi_i(y) - \pi_i(z)\bigr| \;=\; |y_i - z_i| \;\le\; \lVert y - z\rVert_2 \;=\; d_2(y,z),$$

the middle inequality being $|w_i| \le \lVert w\rVert_2$ at $w := y-z$
([[lem-every-norm-on-rn-is-continuous-for-the-euclidean-metric]] clause 3, or
directly because $w_i^{2}$ is one term of the sum $\sum_{k<m}w_k^{2}$). Written
in coordinates, $f(x)$ is the vector whose $i$-th coordinate is $f_i(x)$, and
$f(x) = \sum_{i<m} f_i(x)\,e_i$ in the standard basis
([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]]).

## Remarks

- **The codomain $\mathbb{R}^{0}$ is excluded by the standing hypothesis
  $m \ge 1$, and nothing is lost.** $\mathbb{R}^{0}$ has exactly one element, so
  every function into it is constant and every ball condition holds trivially;
  every such map is continuous and every limit is the unique point. That case is
  true, uninteresting, and not what this page is about. It is also outside the
  reach of [[lem-metrics-on-rn]], which defines the metrics only for $m \ge 1$.

- **The domain may be any metric space, and this matters twice below.** The
  derivative of [[def-vector-valued-derivative-and-integral]] needs a real
  domain, so it uses the limit clause; the companion page's function of two real
  variables needs the domain $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, so it uses the continuity clause.
  Both are instances of the same definition, and neither introduces a second
  notion.

- **When $m = 1$ the codomain is $\mathbb{R}^{1}$, not $\mathbb{R}$.** These are
  different sets, $\mathbb{R}^{1}$ being a set of functions $1 \to \mathbb{R}$.
  The map $\theta : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^{1}$ sending $t$ to the function
  with value $t$ at $0$ is an isometric bijection for $d_2$
  ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]), and under it the notions above become
  those of [[def-continuity-real]] and [[def-function-limit]]. Every comparison
  on this page between the vector-valued theory and the one-dimensional theory
  goes through that identification, stated explicitly each time.

- **Convergence of sequences in $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ is not redefined here.** It is
  [[def-metric-convergence]] for $(\mathbb{R}^{m},d_2)$, with balls as in
  [[def-metric-ball]], and its componentwise characterisation is
  [[thm-componentwise-convergence-and-completeness]].

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$, let $c$ be a limit
point of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]) and let $L, L' \in \mathbb{R}$. If

$$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L \qquad \text{and} \qquad \lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L'$$

([[def-function-limit]]), then $L = L'$.

A function therefore has **at most one** limit at a limit point of its domain,
which is what licenses the notation $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ for a single real
number. This lemma is recorded in the `justified_by` field of
[[def-function-limit]] for exactly that reason.

**The hypothesis that $c$ is a limit point is not removable.** At an isolated
point of the domain the same $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula is satisfied
vacuously by every real at once, which is the content of
[[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$, a limit point $c$ of $A$, and reals $L, L'$ with $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$ and $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L'$ ([[def-function-limit]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L1] The limit condition: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$, and likewise with $L'$ in place of $L$ ([[def-function-limit]]).

[L2] Limit point: for every real $\delta > 0$ there is $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] Triangle inequality: $|u + v| \le |u| + |v|$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L4] Absolute value: $|u| \ge 0$; $|u| = 0$ if and only if $u = 0$; and $|-u| = |u|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L5] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: trichotomy, so $u \ne 0$ together with $|u| \ge 0$ and $|u| \ne 0$ forces $|u| > 0$, and $t < t$ is impossible; adding two strict inequalities ([[lem-of-add-order]]); $0 < 1$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]), hence $2 := 1 + 1 > 0$ and $2^{-1} > 0$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]), so $\eta/2 > 0$ and $(\eta/2) \cdot 2 = \eta$ whenever $\eta > 0$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]]); and of two positive reals the smaller is positive, the order being total.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $L \ne L'$. [assume-contra]

2.1 Then $L - L' \ne 0$, so $|L - L'| \ne 0$ while $|L - L'| \ge 0$, and trichotomy gives $|L - L'| > 0$; hence $\varepsilon := |L - L'|/2 > 0$ and $2\varepsilon = |L - L'|$. [step 1.1, L4, L5]

3.1 Applying [L1] twice with this $\varepsilon$, fix reals $\delta_1 > 0$ and $\delta_2 > 0$ such that every $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta_1$ has $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ and every $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta_2$ has $|f(x) - L'| < \varepsilon$; put $\delta$ to be the smaller of $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$, so $\delta > 0$. [step 2.1, L1, L5, choose]

4.1 Since $c$ is a limit point of $A$, fix $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$. [step 3.1, L2, choose]

5.1 That $x$ satisfies $0 < |x - c| < \delta_1$ and $0 < |x - c| < \delta_2$, hence both $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ and $|f(x) - L'| < \varepsilon$. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L1]

6.1 Therefore $|L - L'| = |(L - f(x)) + (f(x) - L')| \le |L - f(x)| + |f(x) - L'| = |f(x) - L| + |f(x) - L'| < \varepsilon + \varepsilon = 2\varepsilon = |L - L'|$. [step 5.1, L3, L4, L5]

7.1 So $|L - L'| < |L - L'|$, which trichotomy forbids; the assumption $L \ne L'$ is untenable, and hence $L = L'$. [step 6.1, L5, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where each hypothesis is spent.** The limit conditions are used only in step 5.1, and the limit-point hypothesis only in step 4.1, to produce a *single* point $x$ of the domain near $c$ at which both estimates can be read. Without such a point the two estimates never meet and nothing forces $L = L'$; that is the whole mechanism, and it is the reason [[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]] is false.

- **The sequential analogue** is [[lem-limit-unique]], proved by the same two-estimates-at-one-index argument. Neither statement uses any choice principle.

- **One-sided limits inherit this.** By [[def-one-sided-limits]] a one-sided limit is the limit of a restriction of $f$, so applying this lemma to that restriction gives uniqueness there too; nothing has to be reproved.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]), and let $c, d$ satisfy

$$a \;\le\; c \;<\; d \;\le\; b .$$

Then the restriction of $f$ to $[c,d]$ is bounded ([[def-bounded-set]]) and
integrable on $[c,d]$.

The degenerate case $c = d$ is not an omission: there $\int_c^c f = 0$ by
[[def-oriented-integral]], and no partition of $[c,d]$ exists to speak of
([[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, an integrable $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, and reals $c, d$ with $a \le c < d \le b$. Write $g$ for the restriction of $f$ to $[c,d]$.

[L1] Riemann's criterion: a bounded function on a closed bounded interval with distinct endpoints is integrable if and only if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a partition $P$ of that interval with $U(\cdot,P) - L(\cdot,P) < \varepsilon$ ([[thm-riemann-criterion]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L2] For a partition $P$ of $[a,b]$ and a point $p \in [a,b]$, the partition $P + p$ satisfies $\operatorname{pts}(P+p) = \operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \{p\}$ and refines $P$; a refinement of a refinement refines the original, since the point-set inclusions compose ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L3] If $P'$ refines $P$ then $L(f,P) \le L(f,P') \le U(f,P') \le U(f,P)$ ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]], claim 1).

[L4] For a partition $R = (n,t)$ of an interval and bounded $h$ on it: $L(h,R) = \sum_{i<n} m_i \Delta_i$, $U(h,R) = \sum_{i<n} M_i\Delta_i$ with $m_i = \inf h[I_i]$, $M_i = \sup h[I_i]$, $I_i = [t_i,t_{i+1}]$, $\Delta_i = t_{i+1}-t_i > 0$, and $M_i - m_i \ge 0$ ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-interval]]).

[L5] Finite sums: additivity, scaling, splitting at an intermediate index with $\sum_{k=m}^{n-1}a_k = \sum_{j<n-m}a_{m+j}$, and monotonicity in the terms, so that a sum of nonnegative terms is at most a sum containing those terms among others ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], clauses 1 to 4).

[L6] A partition $P' = (n',t')$ of $[a,b]$ has $t'$ strictly increasing on indices $\le n'$, hence injective there, so a point of $\operatorname{pts}(P')$ is $t'_j$ for exactly one $j \le n'$; and $j < k$ gives $t'_j < t'_k$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L7] A restriction of a bounded function is bounded: the same $M$ serves fewer points ([[def-bounded-set]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $g$ is bounded on $[c,d]$, since $[c,d] \subseteq [a,b]$ and $f$ is bounded on $[a,b]$, integrability presupposing boundedness. [given, L7]

1.2 Let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given, and fix a partition $P$ of $[a,b]$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$. [given, L1, choose]

2.1 Put $P' := (P + c) + d$, a partition of $[a,b]$ refining $P$ whose point set contains $c$ and $d$. [step 1.2, L2, construct]

3.1 By [L3] applied to the pair $(P, P')$, $U(f,P') - L(f,P') \le U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L3]

3.2 Write $P' = (n',t')$ and fix the unique indices $p, q \le n'$ with $t'_p = c$ and $t'_q = d$; then $p < q$, because $c < d$ and $t'$ is increasing on those indices. [step 2.1, L6, choose]

4.1 Define $Q := (q-p,\ s)$ by $s_i := t'_{p+i}$ for $i \le q-p$ and $s_k := d$ for $k \ge q-p$. Then $s_0 = t'_p = c$, $s_{q-p} = t'_q = d$, and $s_i < s_{i+1}$ for $i < q-p$ by [L6], with $q - p \ge 1$; so $Q$ is a partition of $[c,d]$, its $i$-th subinterval is $[t'_{p+i}, t'_{p+i+1}] = I'_{p+i}$ and its $i$-th length is $\Delta'_{p+i}$. [step 3.2, L6, construct]

5.1 For $i < q-p$ the $i$-th subinterval of $Q$ is $I'_{p+i} \subseteq [c,d]$, and $g$ agrees with $f$ there, so the extreme values of $g$ on it are $M'_{p+i}$ and $m'_{p+i}$; hence $U(g,Q) - L(g,Q) = \sum_{i<q-p}\bigl(M'_{p+i} - m'_{p+i}\bigr)\Delta'_{p+i}$ by [L4] and [L5]. [step 4.1, L4, L5]

6.1 Every term $\bigl(M'_j - m'_j\bigr)\Delta'_j$ is nonnegative by [L4], and splitting $\sum_{j<n'}$ first at $p$ and then at $q$ exhibits $\sum_{i<q-p}\bigl(M'_{p+i}-m'_{p+i}\bigr)\Delta'_{p+i}$ as one of the three pieces of $\sum_{j<n'}\bigl(M'_j-m'_j\bigr)\Delta'_j$, the other two being nonnegative; so the displayed sum is at most $U(f,P') - L(f,P')$. [step 5.1, L4, L5]

7.1 Combining, $U(g,Q) - L(g,Q) \le U(f,P') - L(f,P') < \varepsilon$. [step 3.1, step 5.1, step 6.1]

8.1 Since $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary and $g$ is bounded, [L1] applies on $[c,d]$ and $g$ is integrable there. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 7.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The one step that is not bookkeeping is the re-indexing.** A partition in this library is a pair $(n,t)$ with a tail convention ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]), not a set of points, so "restrict $P'$ to $[c,d]$" is not a defined operation; step 4.1 writes the restricted list out, shifts its index by $p$ and resets its tail to $d$. Everything else follows from the fact that dropping nonnegative terms from a finite sum cannot increase it.

- **The converse is also true, and is proved separately.** Integrability on $[a,c]$ and on $[c,b]$ gives integrability on $[a,b]$; that direction needs a splice rather than a restriction and is the second half of [[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]].

## Statement

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]) and let $(x_k)$ be a
sequence in $X$ ([[def-metric-convergence]]). If $x_k \to p$ and $x_k \to q$,
then $p = q$.

So a convergent sequence in a metric space has exactly one limit, and the
notation $\lim_k x_k$ is unambiguous.

**Given:** A metric space $(X,d)$, a sequence $(x_k)$ in $X$, and points $p, q \in X$ with $x_k \to p$ and $x_k \to q$.

[A1] Convergence: $x_k \to p$ means that for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $d(x_k,p) < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$ ([[def-metric-convergence]], [[def-real-limit]]); and $d(x,y) \ge 0$ for all $x, y \in X$, so in particular $d(x_k,p) \ge 0$ and its absolute value is itself ([[lem-metric-nonnegativity]], [[def-abs-value]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L1] Density of the rationals: strictly between any two reals lies a rational, so below any real $\eta > 0$ there is a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L2] Halving. For a real $c > 0$ set $2 := 1 + 1$ and $c/2 := c \cdot 2^{-1}$. Then $2 > 0$, so $2 \ne 0$ and $2^{-1} > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]]); hence $c/2 > 0$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]); and $c/2 + c/2 = c(2^{-1} + 2^{-1}) = c(2 \cdot 2^{-1}) = c$ ([[def-field]]).

[L3] Separation (M1) and the triangle inequality (M3) of $d$, together with symmetry (M2) ([[def-metric-space]]).

[L4] Trichotomy of the order of $\mathbb{R}$, and transitivity: $a < b$ and $b \le a$ cannot both hold ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] Adding two inequalities: $a < b$ and $c < d$ give $a + c < b + d$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $p \ne q$. [assume-contra]

2.1 By (M1) $d(p,q) \ne 0$, and $d(p,q) \ge 0$, so $c := d(p,q) > 0$ by trichotomy; put $\eta := c/2$, a positive real with $\eta + \eta = c$. [step 1.1, A1, L2, L3, L4]

3.1 Fix a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, and use the convergence hypotheses at $\varepsilon$ to fix $K_1, K_2 \in \mathbb{N}$ with $d(x_k,p) < \varepsilon$ for $k \ge K_1$ and $d(x_k,q) < \varepsilon$ for $k \ge K_2$. [step 2.1, A1, L1, choose]

4.1 Let $m$ be any natural with $m \ge K_1$ and $m \ge K_2$, for instance $m := K_1 + K_2$; then $d(x_m,p) < \varepsilon$ and $d(x_m,q) < \varepsilon$. [step 3.1, choose]

5.1 By symmetry and the triangle inequality, $c = d(p,q) \le d(p,x_m) + d(x_m,q) = d(x_m,p) + d(x_m,q) < \varepsilon + \varepsilon < \eta + \eta = c$. [step 4.1, step 2.1, L3, L5]

6.1 Step 5.1 asserts $c < c$, which trichotomy forbids; the supposition of step 1.1 is therefore untenable and $p = q$. [step 5.1, L4, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where each axiom is spent.** Separation (M1) is what turns $p \ne q$ into $d(p,q) > 0$, and it is the only axiom that distinguishes a metric from a pseudometric ([[def-metric-space]]). In a pseudometric space with $d(p,q) = 0$ and $p \ne q$, the constant sequence $x_k = p$ converges to both, so the lemma is false there and this is exactly the step that fails.
- **The same argument proves more**, namely that a metric space is Hausdorff: the balls $B(p, c/2)$ and $B(q, c/2)$ are disjoint. That is recorded separately as [[thm-metric-hausdorff-separation]], and uniqueness of limits follows from it as well.
- **Instantiating at a rational is not cosmetic.** [[def-real-limit]] quantifies over rational $\varepsilon$, so a convergence hypothesis may only be applied at a rational; step 3.1 passes from the real $\eta$ to a rational below it using [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]], which is the sanctioned move.

## Statement

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]), let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $F^{n}$ be the
function space on the von Neumann natural $n = \{0, \dots, n-1\}$, with the
pointwise operations ([[def-function-space]], [[def-natural-numbers]],
[[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]). For $i < n$ define the **standard unit vector**
$e_i \in F^{n}$ by

$$e_i(i) = 1_F, \qquad e_i(j) = 0_F \ \text{ for } j < n \text{ with } j \ne i .$$

Then:

1. **Finite sums in a function space are pointwise.** For every set $X$, every
   $p \in \mathbb{N}$, every list $u : p \to F^{X}$ and every $j \in X$,
   $$\Bigl(\sum_{k<p} u_k\Bigr)(j) \;=\; \sum_{k<p} u_k(j),$$
   the right-hand sum being taken in $(F,+,0_F)$. (Stated here for an arbitrary
   $X$ because the companion page needs it at $X = \mathbb{N}$.)
2. $e : n \to F^{n}$ is an ordered basis of $F^{n}$ ([[def-linear-basis]]); in
   particular $e$ is injective and its image $e[n] = \{\, e_i : i < n \,\}$ is a
   basis of $F^{n}$ with $e[n] \approx n$ ([[def-equinumerous]]);
3. for every $\lambda : n \to F$ and every $j < n$,
   $\bigl(\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i e_i\bigr)(j) = \lambda_j$; equivalently the
   coordinate list of $x \in F^{n}$ with respect to the ordered basis $e$
   ([[thm-unique-coordinates-with-respect-to-an-ordered-basis]]) is
   $i \mapsto x(i)$;
4. $F^{n}$ is finite-dimensional over $F$ with $\dim_F F^{n} = n$
   ([[def-dimension]]);
5. at $n = 0$ this reads: $F^{0}$ has exactly one element, the empty function,
   so $F^{0}$ is the zero space, the empty list is its ordered basis,
   $\varnothing$ is its basis and $\dim_F F^{0} = 0$.

Every index runs from $0$, so the coordinates of an element of $F^{n}$ are
$x_0, \dots, x_{n-1}$ and no statement above is restricted to $n \ge 1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A field $F$, a natural number $n$, the vector space $F^{n}$ with pointwise operations, and the vectors $e_i$ for $i < n$.

[L1] $F^{X}$ is a vector space over $F$ with $(x+y)(j) = x(j)+y(j)$, $(\lambda x)(j) = \lambda\,x(j)$ and zero the constant function at $0_F$; two elements are equal exactly when they agree at every point; and $F^{0}$ has exactly one element, the empty function, which is $0_{F^{0}}$ ([[def-function-space]], [[def-vector-space]]).

[L2] Finite sums: $\sum_{k<0}u_k$ is the zero vector and $\sum_{k<\sigma(p)}u_k = \bigl(\sum_{k<p}u_k\bigr) + u_p$, in any vector space ([[def-monoid-finite-product]], [[def-linear-combination-and-span]]).

[L3] $F$ is a vector space over itself, with the field addition and multiplication ([[lem-restriction-of-scalars]], claim 1), so the finite sums of $\mathbb{N}$-indexed lists of scalars are available in $(F,+,0_F)$ and satisfy (F1) and (F3); in particular a list of scalars vanishing off a single index sums to its value at that index ([[def-sum-of-linear-subspaces]]).

[L4] In $F$: $\lambda 1_F = \lambda$ and $\lambda 0_F = 0_F$ for every $\lambda \in F$ ([[def-field]], [[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]]).

[L5] A list $v : n \to V$ is an ordered basis of $V$ if and only if every $x \in V$ is $\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i v_i$ for exactly one $\lambda : n \to F$; an ordered basis is injective and its image is a basis with $v[n] \approx n$ ([[thm-unique-coordinates-with-respect-to-an-ordered-basis]], [[def-linear-basis]], [[def-linear-independence]], [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L6] $\dim_F V$ is the unique $p \in \mathbb{N}$ with a basis $B \approx p$, defined when $V$ has a finite basis ([[def-dimension]], [[def-countable]]).

[L7] Induction on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Claim 1, that a finite sum in $F^{X}$ is computed pointwise: for every $p \in \mathbb{N}$, every list $u : p \to F^{X}$ and every $j \in X$, $\bigl(\sum_{k<p}u_k\bigr)(j) = \sum_{k<p}u_k(j)$, the right-hand sum being taken in $(F,+,0_F)$. By induction on $p$: at $p = 0$ the left side is the value at $j$ of the constant function $0_F$ and the right side is the empty sum $0_F$; and if it holds at $p$, then $\bigl(\sum_{k<\sigma(p)}u_k\bigr)(j) = \bigl(\sum_{k<p}u_k + u_p\bigr)(j) = \bigl(\sum_{k<p}u_k\bigr)(j) + u_p(j) = \sum_{k<p}u_k(j) + u_p(j) = \sum_{k<\sigma(p)}u_k(j)$, using pointwise addition and the recursion. [L1, L2, L3, L7]

2.1 Evaluating a combination of the $e_i$. Let $\lambda : n \to F$ and $j < n$. By step 1.1 and pointwise scalar multiplication, $\bigl(\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i e_i\bigr)(j) = \sum_{i<n}(\lambda_i e_i)(j) = \sum_{i<n}\lambda_i\, e_i(j)$. The list of scalars $i \mapsto \lambda_i\,e_i(j)$ takes the value $\lambda_i 0_F = 0_F$ at every $i \ne j$ and the value $\lambda_j 1_F = \lambda_j$ at $i = j$, so it vanishes off the single index $j$ and therefore sums to $\lambda_j$. Hence $\bigl(\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i e_i\bigr)(j) = \lambda_j$ for every $j < n$. [step 1.1, L1, L3, L4]

3.1 Existence and uniqueness of coordinates. Given $x \in F^{n}$, put $\lambda_i := x(i)$; by step 2.1 the vectors $\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i e_i$ and $x$ agree at every $j < n$, hence are equal. And if $\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i e_i = \sum_{i<n}\mu_i e_i$, then evaluating both sides at $j$ and using step 2.1 gives $\lambda_j = \mu_j$ for every $j < n$. So every $x \in F^{n}$ is $\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i e_i$ for exactly one $\lambda : n \to F$. [step 2.1, L1]

4.1 Claims 2 and 3. Step 2.1 is claim 3, and by the coordinate characterisation of an ordered basis, step 3.1 says exactly that $e$ is an ordered basis of $F^{n}$; hence $e$ is injective, $e[n]$ is a basis of $F^{n}$, and $e[n] \approx n$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L5]

5.1 Claims 4 and 5. By step 4.1 the space $F^{n}$ has a basis with $n$ elements, so it is finite-dimensional and $\dim_F F^{n} = n$. At $n = 0$ the space $F^{0}$ has exactly one element, the empty function, which is its zero vector, so $F^{0}$ is the zero space; the list $e$ is then the empty list, its image is $\varnothing$, and $\dim_F F^{0} = 0$. [step 4.1, L1, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- **The indices start at $0$ because a natural number is the set of its predecessors.** $F^{n}$ is the function space $F^{X}$ at $X = n = \{0,\dots,n-1\}$ ([[def-function-space]], [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]), so an element of $F^{n}$ is a function on $\{0,\dots,n-1\}$ and there is no $e_n$. Reading the standard basis off a $1$-indexed source would put a vector outside the space at one end and lose one at the other.

- **Step 1.1 is not a triviality to be skipped.** That a finite sum of functions is the pointwise finite sum is a statement about the recursion defining [[def-monoid-finite-product]] in two different monoids, and it is proved by induction. Every evaluation argument on this page and on the companion page rests on it.

- **This is the concrete counterweight to [[cor-every-vector-space-has-a-basis]].** Here a basis is written down and no choice principle is used anywhere; there a basis is produced by Zorn's lemma and none is exhibited. The companion page carries both extremes for infinite-dimensional spaces as well: an explicit infinite basis for the eventually zero families, and a basis of $\mathbb{R}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ that no argument exhibits.

## Statement

Let $a < c < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]). Then:

1. $f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ ([[def-darboux-integral]]) **if and only if** its
   restrictions to $[a,c]$ and to $[c,b]$ are integrable;
2. and in that case
   $$\int_a^b f \;=\; \int_a^c f \;+\; \int_c^b f .$$
3. **Oriented form.** Let $\alpha < \beta$ be reals, let $f : [\alpha,\beta] \to
   \mathbb{R}$ be integrable, and let $u, v, w \in [\alpha,\beta]$ be arbitrary.
   Then, with the convention of [[def-oriented-integral]],
   $$\int_u^v f \;+\; \int_v^w f \;=\; \int_u^w f .$$

Claim 3 is where [[def-oriented-integral]] earns its place: it holds for every
arrangement of the three points, including the degenerate ones, and it is the
form used everywhere below.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < c < b$ and a bounded $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$; and, for claim 3, reals $\alpha < \beta$, an integrable $f : [\alpha,\beta] \to \mathbb{R}$ and points $u,v,w \in [\alpha,\beta]$. Let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given.

[L1] Riemann's criterion on any closed bounded interval with distinct endpoints ([[thm-riemann-criterion]]).

[L2] A function integrable on $[p,q]$ is integrable on every $[p',q'] \subseteq [p,q]$ with $p' < q'$ ([[lem-integrability-on-a-subinterval]]).

[L3] For a partition $R = (n,t)$ and bounded $h$: $L(h,R) = \sum_{i<n}m_i\Delta_i$, $U(h,R) = \sum_{i<n}M_i\Delta_i$, and $L(h,R) \le \underline{\int} h \le \overline{\int} h \le U(h,R)$, the integral being the common value of the two when they agree ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L4] A partition of $[p,q]$ is a pair $(n,t)$ with $n \ge 1$, $t_0 = p$, $t_i < t_{i+1}$ for $i < n$ and $t_k = q$ for $k \ge n$; its subintervals are $[t_i,t_{i+1}]$ for $i<n$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-interval]]).

[L5] Finite sums split at an intermediate index, with $\sum_{k=p}^{q-1}x_k = \sum_{j<q-p}x_{p+j}$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], clause 3).

[L6] With oriented limits, $\int_v^u h = -\int_u^v h$ and $\int_u^u h = 0$ ([[def-oriented-integral]]).

[L7] Ordered-field arithmetic: adding a constant preserves an inequality, the order is total and transitive, and a real of absolute value below every positive real is $0$ ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Claim 1, forward.** If $f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ then, since $a < c$ and $c < b$, [L2] gives integrability on $[a,c]$ and on $[c,b]$. [L2]

1.2 **The splice.** Let $P_1 = (n_1,t^1)$ be a partition of $[a,c]$ and $P_2 = (n_2,t^2)$ one of $[c,b]$. Define $P := (n_1+n_2,\ t)$ by $t_i := t^1_i$ for $i \le n_1$, $t_{n_1+j} := t^2_j$ for $j \le n_2$, and $t_k := b$ for $k \ge n_1+n_2$. The two prescriptions agree at $i = n_1$, where $t^1_{n_1} = c = t^2_0$; and $t_0 = a$, $t_{n_1+n_2} = t^2_{n_2} = b$, with $t_i < t_{i+1}$ for every $i < n_1+n_2$. So $P$ is a partition of $[a,b]$. [L4, construct]

1.3 **Claim 1, converse.** Suppose $f$ is integrable on $[a,c]$ and on $[c,b]$, and use [L1] on each to fix $P_1$ with $U(f,P_1)-L(f,P_1) < \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1}$ and $P_2$ with $U(f,P_2)-L(f,P_2) < \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1}$. [L1, choose]

2.1 The first $n_1$ subintervals of $P$ are those of $P_1$ and the last $n_2$ are those of $P_2$, with the matching lengths, so by [L3] and the splitting law [L5], $L(f,P) = L(f,P_1) + L(f,P_2)$ and $U(f,P) = U(f,P_1) + U(f,P_2)$. [step 1.2, L3, L4, L5]

3.1 For the splice $P$ of those two, step 2.1 gives $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$; as $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary and $f$ is bounded, [L1] makes $f$ integrable on $[a,b]$. [step 1.2, step 2.1, step 1.3, L1, L7]

4.1 **Claim 2.** With $P_1$, $P_2$ and $P$ as above, [L3] puts $\int_a^b f$ between $L(f,P)$ and $U(f,P)$, that is between $L(f,P_1)+L(f,P_2)$ and $U(f,P_1)+U(f,P_2)$ by step 2.1; and [L3] applied on $[a,c]$ and on $[c,b]$ puts $\int_a^c f + \int_c^b f$ between the same two numbers. [step 2.1, step 1.3, step 3.1, L3]

5.1 Those two numbers differ by less than $\varepsilon$ by step 1.3, so $\bigl|\int_a^b f - \int_a^c f - \int_c^b f\bigr| < \varepsilon$; as $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary the difference is $0$, which is claim 2. [step 1.3, step 4.1, L7]

6.1 **Claim 3, first the sorted case.** Let $x \le y$ in $[\alpha,\beta]$. Then $\int_\alpha^y f = \int_\alpha^x f + \int_x^y f$. Indeed if $\alpha < x < y$ this is claim 2 applied on $[\alpha,y]$, where $f$ is integrable by [L2]; if $x = \alpha$ the middle term is $0$ by [L6] and the identity is trivial; and if $x = y$ the last term is $0$ by [L6] and the identity is again trivial. [step 5.1, L2, L6]

7.1 Put $F(x) := \int_\alpha^x f$ for $x \in [\alpha,\beta]$, which is defined by [L2] and [L6]. Then $\int_x^y f = F(y) - F(x)$ for **all** $x,y \in [\alpha,\beta]$: for $x < y$ this is step 6.1 rearranged; for $x = y$ both sides are $0$ by [L6]; and for $x > y$ the case already proved gives $\int_y^x f = F(x)-F(y)$, and [L6] negates both sides. [step 6.1, L2, L6, construct]

8.1 **Claim 3.** For arbitrary $u,v,w \in [\alpha,\beta]$, step 7.1 gives $\int_u^v f + \int_v^w f = \bigl(F(v)-F(u)\bigr) + \bigl(F(w)-F(v)\bigr) = F(w)-F(u) = \int_u^w f$. [step 7.1, algebra] ∎

## Remarks

- **The oriented form is not proved by listing six orderings.** Step 7.1 shows that the oriented integral between two points is a *difference of values of one function of one variable*, after which claim 3 is the cancellation $(F(v)-F(u))+(F(w)-F(v)) = F(w)-F(u)$, valid however the three points are arranged and however many of them coincide. The case analysis is confined to the two lines of step 7.1, and no appeal to symmetry is made anywhere.

- **The function $F$ of step 7.1 is the integral function**, and it is given its own item, [[def-the-integral-function]], because the rest of the page is about it. Nothing there re-proves step 7.1; it cites this theorem.

- **Boundedness on the whole of $[a,b]$ is a hypothesis of claim 1 in both directions.** Boundedness on $[a,c]$ and on $[c,b]$ separately does give boundedness on the union, so the converse could be stated with the hypothesis split; it is stated globally because [[def-darboux-sums]] needs it globally to make $U(f,P)$ meaningful for a partition of $[a,b]$.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $c \in A$ be a limit point of $A$
([[def-limit-point-r]]), let $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ be differentiable at $c$
([[def-derivative]]) and let $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$. Then:

1. $f + g$ is differentiable at $c$ and $(f+g)'(c) = f'(c) + g'(c)$;
2. $\alpha f$ is differentiable at $c$ and $(\alpha f)'(c) = \alpha f'(c)$;
3. $fg$ is differentiable at $c$ and $(fg)'(c) = f'(c)g(c) + f(c)g'(c)$;
4. if $g(c) \ne 0$ then, writing $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$, the
   point $c$ lies in $A_0$ and is a limit point of $A_0$, the quotient
   $(f/g)|_{A_0} : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$, $x \mapsto f(x)/g(x)$, is differentiable
   at $c$ as a function on $A_0$, and
   $$\bigl((f/g)|_{A_0}\bigr)'(c) \;=\; \frac{f'(c)\,g(c) - f(c)\,g'(c)}{g(c)^{2}} .$$

Each claim asserts two things: that the derivative on the left exists, and that
it has the stated value. Both are proved.

**Why claim 4 is stated on $A_0$.** The function $f/g$ is not defined where $g$
vanishes, and $g$ may vanish at points of $A$ far from $c$; restricting to $A_0$
is forced. That the restriction still has $c$ as a limit point, so that a
derivative there means anything at all, is not free either, and it is the last
claim of [[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]] applied to $g$. The hypothesis
is $g(c) \ne 0$, not "$g$ vanishes nowhere".

**Everything is proved through
[[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]].** No difference quotient is estimated and
no limit theorem beyond continuity is used, so no choice principle is spent.
The four identities are four algebraic rearrangements of an increment, each
followed by a reading of [[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a point $c \in A$ that is a limit point of $A$, functions $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ differentiable at $c$, and a real $\alpha$; for claim 4 also the hypothesis $g(c) \ne 0$ together with $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$ ([[def-derivative]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L1] Carathéodory's characterisation ([[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]]), used in both directions: for a set $B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a point $p \in B$ that is a limit point of $B$ and a function $h : B \to \mathbb{R}$, the function $h$ is differentiable at $p$ if and only if there is $\eta : B \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $p$, with $h(x) - h(p) = \eta(x)(x - p)$ for every $x \in B$, and then $\eta(p) = h'(p)$.

[L2] Algebra of continuous functions ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]]): sums, scalar multiples and products of functions continuous at a point are continuous there (claim 1); every constant function and the identity are continuous everywhere on the domain (claim 5); and if $u, v$ are continuous at a point $p$ of their common domain $D$ with $v(p) \ne 0$, then $p$ lies in $D_0 := \{x \in D : v(x) \ne 0\}$ and $(u/v)|_{D_0}$ is continuous at $p$ as a function on $D_0$ (claim 4).

[L3] Continuity passes to a subset of the domain: if $B \subseteq A$, if $p \in B$ and if $\psi : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $p$, then $\psi|_B$ is continuous at $p$, the condition on the restriction quantifying over fewer points ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L4] A function differentiable at $c$ is continuous at $c$ ([[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]]); in particular $g$ is.

[L5] At a limit point $c$ of $A$, continuity of $g$ at $c$ says exactly that $\lim_{x \to c} g(x)$ exists and equals $g(c)$ ([[def-continuity-real]], clause 1, [[def-function-limit]]).

[L6] Sign preservation ([[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]]): if $c$ is a limit point of $A$ and $\lim_{x \to c} g(x)$ exists and is nonzero, then $c$ is a limit point of $A_0 = \{x \in A : g(x) \ne 0\}$.

[L7] A product of two nonzero reals is nonzero ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]), and $g(c)^{2} = g(c)\,g(c)$ ([[def-integer-power]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L1], applied to $f$ and to $g$ on $A$ at $c$, fix $\varphi, \psi : A \to \mathbb{R}$, both continuous at $c$, with $f(x) - f(c) = \varphi(x)(x - c)$ and $g(x) - g(c) = \psi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in A$, and with $\varphi(c) = f'(c)$ and $\psi(c) = g'(c)$. [L1, choose]

1.2 Assume $g(c) \ne 0$. Then $c \in A_0$ by the definition of $A_0$; $g$ is continuous at $c$ by [L4], so $\lim_{x \to c} g(x) = g(c) \ne 0$ by [L5]; and therefore $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$ by [L6]. [L4, L5, L6]

2.1 **Sum.** For every $x \in A$, $(f+g)(x) - (f+g)(c) = \bigl(f(x)-f(c)\bigr) + \bigl(g(x)-g(c)\bigr) = \bigl(\varphi(x) + \psi(x)\bigr)(x-c)$. The function $\varphi + \psi$ is continuous at $c$ by [L2], and $(\varphi+\psi)(c) = f'(c) + g'(c)$. So [L1] gives claim 1. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.2 **Scalar multiple.** For every $x \in A$, $(\alpha f)(x) - (\alpha f)(c) = \alpha\bigl(f(x)-f(c)\bigr) = \bigl(\alpha\varphi(x)\bigr)(x-c)$. The function $\alpha\varphi$ is continuous at $c$ by [L2], with value $\alpha f'(c)$ there. So [L1] gives claim 2. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.3 **Product.** For every $x \in A$, $f(x)g(x) - f(c)g(c) = \bigl(f(x)-f(c)\bigr)g(x) + f(c)\bigl(g(x)-g(c)\bigr) = \bigl(\varphi(x)g(x) + f(c)\psi(x)\bigr)(x-c)$. Put $\chi := \varphi\,g + f(c)\,\psi$; it is continuous at $c$ by [L2], since $\varphi$, $\psi$ and (by [L4]) $g$ are, and constants are; and $\chi(c) = \varphi(c)g(c) + f(c)\psi(c) = f'(c)g(c) + f(c)g'(c)$. So [L1] gives claim 3. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L4]

2.4 **Quotient, the rearrangement.** Assume $g(c) \ne 0$ and let $x \in A_0$, so $g(x) \ne 0$ and $g(c) \ne 0$. Then $f(x)/g(x) - f(c)/g(c) = \bigl(f(x)g(c) - f(c)g(x)\bigr)/\bigl(g(x)g(c)\bigr)$, and $f(x)g(c) - f(c)g(x) = \bigl(f(x)-f(c)\bigr)g(c) - f(c)\bigl(g(x)-g(c)\bigr) = \bigl(\varphi(x)g(c) - f(c)\psi(x)\bigr)(x-c)$. So, defining $\theta : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$ by $\theta(x) := \bigl(\varphi(x)g(c) - f(c)\psi(x)\bigr)/\bigl(g(x)g(c)\bigr)$, one has $(f/g)|_{A_0}(x) - (f/g)|_{A_0}(c) = \theta(x)(x-c)$ for every $x \in A_0$. [step 1.1, L1, L7]

2.5 **Quotient, continuity of the factor.** Assume $g(c) \ne 0$. The restrictions of $\varphi$, $\psi$ and $g$ to $A_0$ are continuous at $c \in A_0$ by [L3] and [L4], so by [L2] the numerator $u(x) := \varphi(x)g(c) - f(c)\psi(x)$ and the denominator $v(x) := g(x)g(c)$ are continuous at $c$ as functions on $A_0$. By [L7] the denominator vanishes at no point of $A_0$, so $\{x \in A_0 : v(x) \ne 0\} = A_0$, and $v(c) = g(c)^{2} \ne 0$; hence claim 4 of [L2] gives that $\theta = (u/v)|_{A_0}$ is continuous at $c$, with $\theta(c) = \bigl(\varphi(c)g(c) - f(c)\psi(c)\bigr)/g(c)^{2} = \bigl(f'(c)g(c) - f(c)g'(c)\bigr)/g(c)^{2}$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L2, L3, L4, L7]

3.1 **Quotient, conclusion.** Assume $g(c) \ne 0$. By step 1.2 the point $c$ lies in $A_0$ and is a limit point of $A_0$; by steps 2.4 and 2.5 the function $\theta : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$ and factors the increment of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$. So [L1], applied on the domain $A_0$ at the point $c$, gives that $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ is differentiable at $c$ with derivative $\theta(c)$: claim 4. [step 1.2, step 2.4, step 2.5, L1]

4.1 Claims 1 to 4 are proved, by steps 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 3.1 respectively, each by exhibiting the Carathéodory factor of the new function and reading its continuity at $c$ off the algebra of continuous functions. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The product rearrangement in one line.** The identity $fg - f(c)g(c) = (f - f(c))\,g + f(c)\,(g - g(c))$ splits the increment of a product into two increments, one multiplied by $g$ and one by a constant. It is the same identity that carries the product case of [[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]], read at the level of increments rather than of $\varepsilon$; here the factor $g$ has to be continuous at $c$ rather than merely bounded near it, and [[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]] is what supplies that.

- **The reciprocal is the case $f \equiv 1$.** Claim 4 then reads $\bigl((1/g)|_{A_0}\bigr)'(c) = -g'(c)/g(c)^{2}$, since $f'(c) = 0$ for a constant $f$; nothing separate has to be proved, and the derivative of a negative integer power on this page is obtained exactly this way.

- **Two hypotheses that look removable and are not.** In claim 4 the hypothesis $g(c) \ne 0$ cannot be weakened to "$g$ is nonzero somewhere near $c$", because $c$ itself must lie in the smaller domain for a derivative there to be a statement about $c$; and the conclusion is about $(f/g)|_{A_0}$, not about any extension of it to $A$, since no such extension is canonical.

## Statement

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$. Then any two norms on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are
equivalent ([[def-equivalent-norms]], [[def-norm-and-normed-space]]).

More precisely, for every norm $N$ on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ there are reals
$c > 0$ and $C' > 0$ with

$$c\,\lVert x\rVert_2 \;\le\; N(x) \;\le\; C'\,\lVert x\rVert_2 \qquad \text{for every } x \in \mathbb{R}^{n},$$

and the general statement follows because equivalence of norms is an equivalence
relation.

**Consequently all the metric notions on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are norm independent**
for $n \ge 1$: any two norms give the same open sets, the same convergent
sequences with the same limits, the same Cauchy sequences and the same uniformly
continuous maps ([[def-equivalent-norms]]).

**The hypothesis $n \ge 1$ is used twice in the proof and both uses are marked**:
once so that the constant $C$ of
[[lem-every-norm-on-rn-is-continuous-for-the-euclidean-metric]] exists, and once
so that the Euclidean unit sphere is **nonempty**, which is what the extreme
value theorem needs. At $n = 0$ the conclusion is true but vacuous, the zero
space carrying exactly one norm ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]), and it is not
obtained from the argument below.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural $n \ge 1$, the space $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with the norms of [[def-p-norms-on-rn]] and the published metric $d_2$ ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]], [[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]]), and a norm $N$ on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$; write $S := \{\, x \in \mathbb{R}^{n} : \lVert x\rVert_2 = 1 \,\}$.

[L1] For $n \ge 1$: $C := \max\{N(e_k) : k<n\}$ exists with $C \ge 0$, $N(x) \le C\lVert x\rVert_1$, $\lVert x\rVert_1 \le \sqrt{\iota(n)}\lVert x\rVert_2$, and $N$ is continuous as a map $(\mathbb{R}^{n}, d_2) \to (\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$ ([[lem-every-norm-on-rn-is-continuous-for-the-euclidean-metric]] clauses 2, 3, 4).

[L2] Equivalence of norms is an equivalence relation, and $c M \le N \le C M$ with $c, C > 0$ is what it means ([[def-equivalent-norms]]).

[L3] Heine-Borel in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n \ge 1$: a subset of $(\mathbb{R}^{n},d_2)$ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded ([[thm-heine-borel-rn]] clause 2, [[def-metric-compactness]], [[def-metric-topology]], [[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]).

[L4] Extreme value theorem: a continuous real-valued function on a **nonempty** compact metric space attains a least value ([[thm-extreme-value-metric]]).

[L5] Continuity characterisations: a map of metric spaces continuous at every point has closed preimages of closed sets ([[thm-metric-continuity-characterisations]], clause (c)).

[L6] Balls, openness and boundedness ([[def-metric-ball]], [[def-metric-topology]], [[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]): $U$ is open when every point of $U$ has a ball inside $U$; $A$ is bounded when $A = \emptyset$ or $A \subseteq B(x_0,r)$ for some $x_0$ and real $r>0$.

[L7] The norm axioms (N1) and (N2), and nonnegativity of a norm ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]).

[L8] The standard basis vector $e_0 \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ exists for $n \ge 1$, with $e_0(0) = 1$ and $e_0(j) = 0$ for $0 \ne j < n$ ([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]]); hence $\lVert e_0\rVert_2 = \sqrt{1} = 1$ ([[def-p-norms-on-rn]], [[thm-of-square-roots]]).

[L9] Inverses: $u > 0$ gives $u^{-1} > 0$, and trichotomy of the order of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L10] Continuity at a point in the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ form, and the metric subspace $(A, d_A)$ with $d_A$ the restriction of $d$ ([[def-metric-continuity]], [[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]], [[def-metric-compactness]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The singleton $\{1\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is closed: if $y \ne 1$ then $r := |y-1| > 0$ and the ball $B(y,r)$ omits $1$, so the complement of $\{1\}$ is open. [L6, L9]

1.2 $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ is itself a norm on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, so by [L1] applied to it, $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2 : (\mathbb{R}^{n},d_2) \to (\mathbb{R},d_{\mathbb{R}})$ is continuous. [L1, L7]

1.3 $S \subseteq B(0,2)$, since $x \in S$ gives $d_2(x,0) = \lVert x\rVert_2 = 1 < 2$; so $S$ is bounded. [L6, L7]

1.4 $e_0 \in S$, because $\lVert e_0\rVert_2 = 1$; this is where $n \ge 1$ is used, since for $n = 0$ there is no index $0 < n$ and no such vector. So $S \ne \emptyset$. [L8]

1.5 For every $a \in S$ and every real $\varepsilon > 0$, a $\delta > 0$ witnessing continuity of $N$ at $a$ as a map on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ also witnesses it for the restriction $N|_S$ on the metric subspace $(S, d_S)$, because $d_S$ is the restriction of $d_2$ and the condition is quantified over fewer points; so $N|_S$ is continuous. [L1, L10]

1.6 Put $C' := C\sqrt{\iota(n)} + 1$, a real $> 0$. By [L1], $N(x) \le C\lVert x\rVert_1 \le C\sqrt{\iota(n)}\lVert x\rVert_2 \le C'\lVert x\rVert_2$, the last step because $\lVert x\rVert_2 \ge 0$. [L1, L7]

2.1 $S$ is the preimage of $\{1\}$ under the continuous $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$, hence closed in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L5]

3.1 $S$ is a compact subset of $(\mathbb{R}^{n},d_2)$, being closed and bounded. [step 1.3, step 2.1, L3]

4.1 By the extreme value theorem applied to the nonempty compact metric space $(S,d_S)$ and the continuous $N|_S$, there is $x_{\min} \in S$ with $N(x_{\min}) \le N(x)$ for every $x \in S$; put $c := N(x_{\min})$. [step 1.4, step 1.5, step 3.1, L4]

5.1 $c > 0$: from $x_{\min} \in S$ we get $\lVert x_{\min}\rVert_2 = 1 \ne 0$, so $x_{\min} \ne 0$ by (N1) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$, so $N(x_{\min}) \ne 0$ by (N1) for $N$, and $N(x_{\min}) \ge 0$; trichotomy leaves $c > 0$. [step 4.1, L7, L9]

5.2 Let $x \ne 0$. Then $\lVert x\rVert_2 > 0$ by (N1) and nonnegativity, so $t := 1/\lVert x\rVert_2 > 0$ and $u := t\,x$ satisfies $\lVert u\rVert_2 = |t|\,\lVert x\rVert_2 = 1$ by (N2); hence $u \in S$ and $c \le N(u) = |t|\,N(x) = N(x)/\lVert x\rVert_2$, that is $c\,\lVert x\rVert_2 \le N(x)$. [step 4.1, L7, L9]

6.1 For $x = 0$ both $c\lVert x\rVert_2$ and $N(x)$ are $0$ by (N1), so $c\lVert x\rVert_2 \le N(x)$ holds for every $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$. [step 5.2, L7]

7.1 Steps 5.1, 6.1 and 1.6 give $c\lVert x\rVert_2 \le N(x) \le C'\lVert x\rVert_2$ with $c, C' > 0$, so every norm $N$ on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is equivalent to $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$. [step 5.1, step 6.1, step 1.6, L2]

8.1 Given two norms $M$ and $N$ on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, each is equivalent to $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ by step 7.1, so $M$ is equivalent to $N$ by symmetry and transitivity of the relation. [step 7.1, L2] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the proof spends, and where it stops.** The only nonelementary ingredients are compactness of the Euclidean unit sphere, obtained from [[thm-heine-borel-rn]], and the extreme value theorem [[thm-extreme-value-metric]]. Heine-Borel in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is proved by bisection and uses no choice principle, and the extreme value theorem is a theorem of ZF ([[rem-compactness-choice-ledger-metric]]), so this theorem costs no choice either.

- **The sphere is where the argument is finite-dimensional.** The step that fails outside $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is step 3.1: closed and bounded gives compact by [[thm-heine-borel-rn]], a theorem about $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for a natural $n$ and about nothing else. The companion page exhibits a real vector space carrying two inequivalent norms, and the same space with a closed bounded set that is not compact. **This remark is a statement about this proof and about that witness; no claim is made here about normed spaces in general, a theory this library has not built.**

- **The constants are not canonical.** Nothing in the statement fixes $c$ or $C'$, and the proof produces one admissible pair, not the best one. Sharp constants for the three named norms on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ are computed on the companion page.

## Statement

Let $m \in \mathbb{N}$ with $m \ge 1$, with vector-valued functions, their
components $f_i = \pi_i \circ f$, their limits and their continuity as in
[[def-vector-valued-functions-limits-and-continuity]].

1. **Continuity is componentwise.** Let $(X,d_X)$ be a metric space, $A \subseteq X$,
   $f : A \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$ and $a \in A$. Then $f$ is continuous at $a$ if and
   only if every component $f_i : A \to \mathbb{R}$ $(i<m)$ is continuous at $a$.
2. **Limits are componentwise.** Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $c$ be a limit
   point of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]), let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$ and let
   $L \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$. Then $\lim_{x\to c} f(x) = L$ if and only if
   $\lim_{x\to c} f_i(x) = L_i$ for every $i<m$ ([[def-function-limit]]).
3. **Algebra.** Let $(X,d_X)$, $A$, $a$ be as in clause 1, let
   $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$ be continuous at $a$ and let $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$.
   Then $f + g$ and $\lambda f$ (defined pointwise) are continuous at $a$; the
   real-valued function $x \mapsto \langle f(x), g(x)\rangle$ is continuous at
   $a$ ([[def-euclidean-inner-product]]); and for every norm $N$ on
   $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ the real-valued function $x \mapsto N(f(x))$ is continuous at
   $a$ ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]).

**Where $m \ge 1$ is spent.** The "if" direction of clauses 1 and 2 divides
$\varepsilon$ by $\iota(m)$, which requires $\iota(m) \ne 0$; and clause 3's last
part quotes a bound available only for $m \ge 1$. The "only if" directions hold
for every $m$ but say nothing at $m = 0$, there being no index $i < 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural $m \ge 1$; a metric space $(X,d_X)$, a subset $A \subseteq X$, a point $a \in A$ and functions $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$; a real $\lambda$; and a real $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] Continuity and limits of vector-valued functions in the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ form, the coordinate projections $\pi_i$, and $|y_i| \le \lVert y\rVert_2$ for $i<m$ ([[def-vector-valued-functions-limits-and-continuity]], [[def-metric-continuity]], [[def-metric-space]], [[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]).

[L2] The comparison $\lVert y\rVert_2 \le \lVert y\rVert_1 = \sum_{i<m}|y_i|$, and $N(y) \le C\lVert y\rVert_1 \le C\sqrt{\iota(m)}\lVert y\rVert_2$ with $C := \max\{N(e_i) : i<m\} \ge 0$, together with $|N(y)-N(z)| \le N(y-z)$, all for $m \ge 1$ ([[lem-every-norm-on-rn-is-continuous-for-the-euclidean-metric]] clauses 1, 2, 3, [[def-p-norms-on-rn]], [[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]]).

[L3] The norm axioms for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]], [[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]]), and $\lVert u-v\rVert_2 = d_2(u,v)$.

[L4] Cauchy-Schwarz: $|\langle u,v\rangle| \le \lVert u\rVert_2\lVert v\rVert_2$, together with bilinearity and symmetry of the inner product ([[thm-cauchy-schwarz-and-the-euclidean-norm]], [[def-euclidean-inner-product]]).

[L5] Laws of finite sums ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[def-finite-sum]]): additivity, scaling, monotonicity, $\sum_{i<m}\mu = \iota(m)\mu$, a sum of nonnegative terms is nonnegative, and each single term is at most such a sum.

[L6] $\iota(m) > 0$ for $m \ge 1$, and $u>0$ gives $u^{-1}>0$ ([[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

[L7] A nonempty finite set of reals has a minimum ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]); and a family of nonempty sets indexed by a natural number has a choice function, this being a theorem of ZF ([[lem-finite-choice]]), which is what licenses picking one $\delta_i$ for each $i<m$.

[L8] Absolute value ([[lem-of-abs-value]]): $|t| \ge 0$, $|st| = |s||t|$, and $|s+t| \le |s|+|t|$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For every $y \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$: $|y_i| \le \lVert y\rVert_2$ for each $i<m$, and $\lVert y\rVert_2 \le \sum_{i<m}|y_i|$. [L1, L2]

1.2 If $a_i < b_i$ for every $i<m$ and $m \ge 1$, then $\sum_{i<m}a_i < \sum_{i<m}b_i$: the list $i \mapsto b_i - a_i$ has positive terms, so its sum is at least its term at index $0$, hence positive, and additivity gives the strict inequality. [L5, L6]

1.3 For each $i<m$ the set of positive reals $\delta$ witnessing continuity of $f_i$ at $a$ for a given tolerance is nonempty whenever $f_i$ is continuous at $a$, so a choice function on the family indexed by $m$ produces $\delta_0,\dots,\delta_{m-1}$ simultaneously, with no choice principle used. [L7]

1.4 For $f+g$: given $\varepsilon > 0$, pick $\delta_1, \delta_2 > 0$ for the tolerance $\varepsilon/\iota(2)$ at $f$ and at $g$ and put $\delta := \min\{\delta_1,\delta_2\}$; then for $d_X(x,a) < \delta$, $\lVert (f+g)(x)-(f+g)(a)\rVert_2 = \lVert (f(x)-f(a)) + (g(x)-g(a))\rVert_2 \le \lVert f(x)-f(a)\rVert_2 + \lVert g(x)-g(a)\rVert_2 < \varepsilon$. [L1, L3, L6, L7]

1.5 For $\lambda f$: if $\lambda = 0$ then $\lambda f$ is constant and every $\delta$ serves; otherwise $|\lambda| > 0$, and a $\delta$ for the tolerance $\varepsilon/|\lambda|$ at $f$ gives $\lVert \lambda f(x) - \lambda f(a)\rVert_2 = |\lambda|\,\lVert f(x)-f(a)\rVert_2 < \varepsilon$. [L1, L3, L6, L8]

1.6 For $N \circ f$: by [L2], $|N(f(x)) - N(f(a))| \le N\bigl(f(x)-f(a)\bigr) \le C\sqrt{\iota(m)}\,\lVert f(x)-f(a)\rVert_2$; so a $\delta$ for the tolerance $\varepsilon/(C\sqrt{\iota(m)}+1)$ at $f$ serves for $N\circ f$. [L1, L2, L6]

1.7 For $\langle f,g\rangle$: first take $\delta_0 > 0$ with $\lVert g(x)-g(a)\rVert_2 < 1$ for $d_X(x,a) < \delta_0$, so that $\lVert g(x)\rVert_2 \le \lVert g(x)-g(a)\rVert_2 + \lVert g(a)\rVert_2 < B := \lVert g(a)\rVert_2 + 1$ there. [L1, L3]

2.1 Suppose $f$ is continuous at $a$ and fix $i<m$. Given $\varepsilon > 0$, take $\delta$ from the definition; for $x \in A$ with $d_X(x,a) < \delta$, step 1.1 gives $|f_i(x)-f_i(a)| \le \lVert f(x)-f(a)\rVert_2 < \varepsilon$. So $f_i$ is continuous at $a$. [step 1.1, L1]

2.2 Conversely suppose every $f_i$ is continuous at $a$. Given $\varepsilon > 0$, the real $\varepsilon/\iota(m)$ is positive; by step 1.3 choose $\delta_i > 0$ for each $i<m$ with $|f_i(x)-f_i(a)| < \varepsilon/\iota(m)$ whenever $x \in A$ and $d_X(x,a) < \delta_i$, and put $\delta := \min\{\delta_0,\dots,\delta_{m-1}\} > 0$. [step 1.3, L1, L6, L7]

2.3 By bilinearity, $\langle f(x),g(x)\rangle - \langle f(a),g(a)\rangle = \langle f(x)-f(a),\, g(x)\rangle + \langle f(a),\, g(x)-g(a)\rangle$, so Cauchy-Schwarz and step 1.7 give $\bigl|\langle f(x),g(x)\rangle - \langle f(a),g(a)\rangle\bigr| \le B\,\lVert f(x)-f(a)\rVert_2 + \lVert f(a)\rVert_2\,\lVert g(x)-g(a)\rVert_2$ for every $x \in A$ with $d_X(x,a) < \delta_0$. [step 1.7, L4, L8]

3.1 For $x \in A$ with $d_X(x,a) < \delta$: each $|f_i(x)-f_i(a)| < \varepsilon/\iota(m)$, so by steps 1.1 and 1.2, $\lVert f(x)-f(a)\rVert_2 \le \sum_{i<m}|f_i(x)-f_i(a)| < \sum_{i<m}\varepsilon/\iota(m) = \varepsilon$. Hence $f$ is continuous at $a$, and clause 1 is proved. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.2, L5, L6]

3.2 Clause 2 is the same two estimates with $f(a)$ replaced by $L$, $f_i(a)$ by $L_i$, and the condition $d_X(x,a) < \delta$ by $0 < |x-c| < \delta$: step 1.1 gives $|f_i(x)-L_i| \le \lVert f(x)-L\rVert_2$ for the forward direction, and steps 1.1, 1.2 give $\lVert f(x)-L\rVert_2 \le \sum_{i<m}|f_i(x)-L_i| < \varepsilon$ for the converse, with $\delta$ the minimum of $m$ radii obtained as in step 2.2. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, L1, L5, L6, L7]

3.3 Put $P := B + \lVert f(a)\rVert_2 + 1 > 0$ and take $\delta \le \delta_0$ positive with both $\lVert f(x)-f(a)\rVert_2 < \varepsilon/P$ and $\lVert g(x)-g(a)\rVert_2 < \varepsilon/P$ for $d_X(x,a) < \delta$; then step 2.3 bounds the difference by $(B + \lVert f(a)\rVert_2)\varepsilon/P < \varepsilon$, so $\langle f,g\rangle$ is continuous at $a$. [step 1.7, step 2.3, L1, L6, L7]

4.1 Steps 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 and 3.3 are clause 3, and with steps 3.1 and 3.2 all three clauses are proved. [step 3.1, step 3.2, step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6, step 3.3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the algebra is proved here rather than quoted.** The published [[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]] and [[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]] are stated for real-valued functions on a subset of $\mathbb{R}$, and the domain in clause 3 is a subset of an arbitrary metric space; quoting them for a metric domain would be a citation to an item for a claim it does not make. The estimates in steps 1.4 to 3.3 are the same ones, written out. When the domain **is** a subset of $\mathbb{R}$, clause 1 and [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]] identify the two readings, and the published theorems may then be used on the components.

- **Clause 3 is what makes the mean value inequality work.** The auxiliary function $t \mapsto \langle u, f(t)\rangle$ of [[thm-mean-value-inequality]] is continuous exactly by the inner-product part of clause 3, applied with the constant function $u$.

- **Nothing here is a sequential argument, so no choice principle is used** beyond the finitely many simultaneous selections of steps 1.3, 2.2 and 3.3, which are covered by [[lem-finite-choice]], a theorem of ZF.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]). Then:

1. $f + g$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ and
   $\int_a^b (f+g) = \int_a^b f + \int_a^b g$;
2. for every real $\lambda$, $\lambda f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ and
   $\int_a^b \lambda f = \lambda \int_a^b f$;
3. consequently, for all reals $\lambda, \mu$ the function $\lambda f + \mu g$ is
   integrable and
   $$\int_a^b(\lambda f + \mu g) \;=\; \lambda\int_a^b f \;+\; \mu\int_a^b g ;$$
4. the same identity holds with oriented limits: if $u, v \in [a,b]$ and $f, g$
   are integrable between $u$ and $v$ ([[def-oriented-integral]]), then
   $\int_u^v(\lambda f + \mu g) = \lambda\int_u^v f + \mu\int_u^v g$.

**Linearity of the integral is not linearity of the Darboux sums**, and the
proof of claim 1 has to squeeze rather than compute. On a subinterval the
inequality $\sup(f+g) \le \sup f + \sup g$ can be strict — take $f(x) = x$ and
$g(x) = -x$ on $[0,1]$, where the left side is $0$ and the right side is $1$ —
so $U(f+g,P)$ is in general strictly below $U(f,P) + U(g,P)$ and no identity
between upper sums is available. Claim 2, by contrast, is an identity at the
level of the sums, with the roles of $\sup$ and $\inf$ exchanged when
$\lambda < 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, integrable $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, reals $\lambda, \mu$, and a real $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] Riemann's criterion: a bounded $h$ on $[a,b]$ is integrable if and only if for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a partition $P$ with $U(h,P) - L(h,P) < \eta$ ([[thm-riemann-criterion]]).

[L2] For every partition $P$ and bounded $h$: $L(h,P) \le \underline{\int_a^b} h \le \overline{\int_a^b} h \le U(h,P)$, and $h$ is integrable exactly when the two integrals agree, their common value being $\int_a^b h$; the lower integral is $\sup_P L(h,P)$ and the upper is $\inf_P U(h,P)$ ([[def-darboux-integral]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L3] $L(h,P) = \sum_{i<n} m_i(h)\Delta_i$ and $U(h,P) = \sum_{i<n}M_i(h)\Delta_i$, where $m_i(h) = \inf h[I_i]$ and $M_i(h) = \sup h[I_i]$ over the subintervals $I_i$ of $P = (n,t)$, with $\Delta_i > 0$; an integrable function is bounded, and a sum of two bounded functions and a scalar multiple of a bounded function are bounded ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L4] If $P'$ refines $P$ then $L(h,P) \le L(h,P') \le U(h,P') \le U(h,P)$; the common refinement $P_1 \vee P_2$ refines both ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L5] Finite sums are additive and homogeneous: $\sum_{i<n}(x_i + y_i) = \sum_{i<n}x_i + \sum_{i<n}y_i$ and $\sum_{i<n}\lambda x_i = \lambda\sum_{i<n}x_i$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], clauses 1 and 2).

[L6] A supremum is the least upper bound and an infimum the greatest lower bound; both exist for a nonempty bounded set and are unique ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-infimum]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L7] Reflection: writing $-S = \{-s : s \in S\}$, a real $u$ is an upper bound of $S$ exactly when $-u$ is a lower bound of $-S$, and conversely; hence $\sup(-S) = -\inf S$ and $\inf(-S) = -\sup S$ for nonempty bounded $S$, by [L6] ([[lem-reflection]]).

[L8] The constant function $0$ is integrable with $\int_a^b 0 = 0$ ([[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]]).

[L9] Ordered-field arithmetic: adding a constant and multiplying by a positive quantity preserve an inequality, the order is total and transitive, and a real $x$ with $|x| < \eta$ for every real $\eta > 0$ is $0$ ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order facts are used in their nonstrict form as well, obtained by adjoining the case of equality.

[L10] With oriented limits, $\int_v^u h = -\int_u^v h$ and $\int_u^u h = 0$ ([[def-oriented-integral]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $f$, $g$, $f+g$ and $\lambda f$ are bounded on $[a,b]$, so all their Darboux sums and integrals are defined. [given, L3]

1.2 For every partition $P = (n,t)$ and every $i < n$: $f(x) + g(x) \le M_i(f) + M_i(g)$ for $x \in I_i$, so $M_i(f) + M_i(g)$ is an upper bound of $(f+g)[I_i]$ and $M_i(f+g) \le M_i(f) + M_i(g)$ by [L6]; dually $m_i(f+g) \ge m_i(f) + m_i(g)$. [L3, L6]

1.3 Fix partitions $P_1$ and $P_2$ with $U(f,P_1) - L(f,P_1) < \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$ and $U(g,P_2) - L(g,P_2) < \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$, and put $P := P_1 \vee P_2$. [given, L1, L4, choose]

1.4 **Claim 2, the case $\lambda = 0$.** Then $\lambda f$ is the constant function $0$, integrable with integral $0 = 0 \cdot \int_a^b f$. [L8]

1.5 **Claim 2, the case $\lambda > 0$.** For every partition $P$ and every $i < n$, $\lambda M_i(f)$ is an upper bound of $(\lambda f)[I_i]$, and any upper bound $w$ of $(\lambda f)[I_i]$ gives the upper bound $w/\lambda$ of $f[I_i]$, whence $M_i(f) \le w/\lambda$ and $\lambda M_i(f) \le w$; so $M_i(\lambda f) = \lambda M_i(f)$ by [L6], and dually $m_i(\lambda f) = \lambda m_i(f)$. [L3, L6, L9]

1.6 **Claim 2, the case $\lambda = -1$.** For every $P$ and $i < n$, $(-f)[I_i] = -\bigl(f[I_i]\bigr)$, so $M_i(-f) = -m_i(f)$ and $m_i(-f) = -M_i(f)$ by [L7]. [L3, L7]

2.1 By [L4], $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1}$ and $U(g,P) - L(g,P) < \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$. [step 1.3, L4]

2.2 Summing the inequalities of step 1.2 over $i < n$ against the positive weights $\Delta_i$ and using [L5] gives $L(f,P) + L(g,P) \le L(f+g,P) \le U(f+g,P) \le U(f,P) + U(g,P)$. [step 1.2, L3, L5, L9]

2.3 With step 1.5 and [L5], $U(\lambda f,P) = \lambda U(f,P)$ and $L(\lambda f, P) = \lambda L(f,P)$ for $\lambda > 0$; hence $U(\lambda f,P)-L(\lambda f,P) = \lambda\bigl(U(f,P)-L(f,P)\bigr)$, which [L1] makes smaller than any prescribed positive number by choosing $P$ suitably, so $\lambda f$ is integrable. [step 1.5, L1, L3, L5, L9]

2.4 With step 1.6 and [L5], $U(-f,P) = -L(f,P)$ and $L(-f,P) = -U(f,P)$, so $U(-f,P)-L(-f,P) = U(f,P)-L(f,P)$ and $-f$ is integrable by [L1]; and by [L7] applied to the sets of Darboux sums, $\overline{\int_a^b}(-f) = -\underline{\int_a^b} f$ and $\underline{\int_a^b}(-f) = -\overline{\int_a^b} f$, so $\int_a^b(-f) = -\int_a^b f$. [step 1.6, L1, L2, L5, L7]

3.1 Hence $U(f+g,P) - L(f+g,P) \le \bigl(U(f,P)-L(f,P)\bigr) + \bigl(U(g,P)-L(g,P)\bigr) < \varepsilon$, so $f+g$ is integrable by [L1], $\varepsilon > 0$ having been arbitrary. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, L1, L9]

3.2 Moreover the set of lower sums of $\lambda f$ is $\lambda$ times the set of lower sums of $f$, and a supremum scales by a positive factor, by the argument of step 1.5 applied to that set; so $\underline{\int_a^b}\lambda f = \lambda \underline{\int_a^b} f$, and likewise for the upper integrals, giving $\int_a^b \lambda f = \lambda\int_a^b f$. [step 1.5, step 2.3, L2, L6, L9]

4.1 Both $\int_a^b(f+g)$ and $\int_a^b f + \int_a^b g$ lie in the interval from $L(f,P)+L(g,P)$ to $U(f,P)+U(g,P)$: the first by [L2] and step 2.2, the second by [L2] applied to $f$ and to $g$ separately. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, L2]

4.2 **Claim 2 for $\lambda < 0$.** Then $-\lambda > 0$ and $\lambda f = (-\lambda)(-f)$, so steps 2.3, 2.4 and 3.2 give integrability and the required identities and $\int_a^b \lambda f = (-\lambda)\int_a^b(-f) = (-\lambda)\bigl(-\int_a^b f\bigr) = \lambda\int_a^b f$. [step 2.3, step 3.2, step 2.4, L9]

5.1 That interval has length less than $\varepsilon$ by step 2.1, so $\bigl|\int_a^b(f+g) - \int_a^b f - \int_a^b g\bigr| < \varepsilon$; as $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary the difference is $0$, which is claim 1. [step 2.1, step 4.1, L9]

5.2 Claim 2 is now proved in all three cases $\lambda = 0$, $\lambda > 0$ and $\lambda < 0$, which are exhaustive by trichotomy. [step 1.4, step 2.3, step 3.2, step 4.2, L9]

6.1 **Claim 3.** By claim 2 the functions $\lambda f$ and $\mu g$ are integrable with integrals $\lambda\int_a^b f$ and $\mu\int_a^b g$, and by claim 1 their sum is integrable with the sum of those integrals. [step 5.1, step 5.2]

7.1 **Claim 4.** If $u < v$ then $u, v \in [a,b]$ and claim 3 applies verbatim on $[u,v]$; if $u = v$ both sides are $0$ by [L10]; and if $u > v$ then applying the case $u < v$ to the pair $(v,u)$ and multiplying by $-1$ gives the identity, by [L10]. [step 6.1, L10] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why claim 1 cannot be an identity of Darboux sums.** The example in the statement shows $\sup(f+g) < \sup f + \sup g$ is possible on a single subinterval, so $U(f+g,P) = U(f,P)+U(g,P)$ is false in general. What survives is the pair of inequalities of step 1.2, and they are enough because the gap between them is squeezed to $0$ by [[thm-riemann-criterion]].

- **The two scalar cases really are different.** For $\lambda > 0$ the extreme values scale; for $\lambda < 0$ they are exchanged, because multiplying by a negative reverses the order ([[lem-reflection]]). Merging the cases and writing $U(\lambda f, P) = \lambda U(f,P)$ for all $\lambda$ would be false at $\lambda = -1$, where the correct identity is $U(-f,P) = -L(f,P)$.

- **The set of integrable functions on $[a,b]$ is closed under the operations named here and under more.** Products, absolute values and the lattice operations are also integrable, but none of them is obtained from linearity alone: the proofs of [[cor-integrability-of-absolute-values-products-and-lattice-operations]] all pass through [[thm-composition-with-a-continuous-function]], with linearity used only to recombine the pieces.

and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$ be integrable
([[def-vector-valued-derivative-and-integral]]). Then:

1. if $a < b$, the real-valued function $t \mapsto \lVert f(t)\rVert_2$ is
   integrable on $[a,b]$ ([[def-darboux-integral]], [[def-p-norms-on-rn]]);
2. $$\Bigl\lVert \int_a^b f \Bigr\rVert_2 \;\le\; \int_a^b \lVert f\rVert_2 .$$

**The hypothesis $a \le b$ is not decoration.** With the orientation convention
of [[def-oriented-integral]] and
[[def-vector-valued-derivative-and-integral]], interchanging the limits changes
the sign of the right-hand side but not of the left, so for $b < a$ the correct
statement is $\bigl\lVert\int_a^b f\bigr\rVert_2 \le \bigl|\int_a^b \lVert f\rVert_2\bigr|$;
the displayed inequality as written is false in that case. This is the same trap
the scalar inequality of
[[cor-integrability-of-absolute-values-products-and-lattice-operations]] carries.

**Clause 1 is a genuine obligation and is discharged before the estimate.** That
each $f_i$ is integrable does not by itself say that
$\sqrt{\sum_{i<m} f_i^{2}}$ is; the square root has to be brought in through
[[thm-composition-with-a-continuous-function]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural $m \ge 1$, reals $a \le b$, an integrable $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$ with components $f_0,\dots,f_{m-1}$, and the vector $v := \int_a^b f \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$; write $g(t) := \sum_{i<m} f_i(t)^{2}$, so that $\lVert f(t)\rVert_2 = \sqrt{g(t)}$ ([[def-euclidean-inner-product]], [[def-p-norms-on-rn]]).

[L1] The vector-valued integral is componentwise: $f$ is integrable exactly when every $f_i$ is bounded and Darboux integrable, and then $\bigl(\int_a^b f\bigr)_i = \int_a^b f_i$; $\int_a^a f = 0$ ([[def-vector-valued-derivative-and-integral]], [[def-darboux-integral]], [[def-oriented-integral]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L2] Linearity of the integral: integrable functions on $[a,b]$ are closed under sums and scalar multiples, and $\int_a^b(\lambda u + \mu w) = \lambda\int_a^b u + \mu\int_a^b w$ ([[thm-linearity-of-the-integral]]).

[L3] Monotonicity of the integral: for $a<b$ and integrable $u \le w$ on $[a,b]$, $\int_a^b u \le \int_a^b w$; and an integrable $u \ge 0$ has $\int_a^b u \ge 0$ ([[thm-monotonicity-of-the-integral]]).

[L4] Products and squares: if $u,w$ are integrable on $[a,b]$ then so are $|u|$, $u^{2}$ and $uw$ ([[cor-integrability-of-absolute-values-products-and-lattice-operations]]).

[L5] Composition: if $u$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ with values in $[\alpha,\beta]$ and $\varphi$ is continuous on $[\alpha,\beta]$, then $\varphi\circ u$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ ([[thm-composition-with-a-continuous-function]], [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L6] Square roots ([[thm-of-square-roots]], [[lem-of-square-monotone]]): every $c \ge 0$ has a unique $\sqrt{c} \ge 0$ with $(\sqrt c)^{2} = c$, and $s \mapsto s^{2}$ is strictly increasing on the nonnegatives, hence injective there.

[L7] Continuous inverse theorem: a continuous injective function on an order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is a bijection onto its order-convex image, whose inverse is continuous ([[thm-continuous-inverse]], [[def-interval]]); and $s \mapsto s^{2}$ is continuous ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]]).

[L8] Cauchy-Schwarz and the inner product: $\langle u,w\rangle = \sum_{i<m}u_iw_i$ is bilinear and symmetric, $\lVert u\rVert_2 = \sqrt{\langle u,u\rangle}$, $\lVert u\rVert_2 \ge 0$, and $|\langle u,w\rangle| \le \lVert u\rVert_2\lVert w\rVert_2$ ([[def-euclidean-inner-product]], [[thm-cauchy-schwarz-and-the-euclidean-norm]], [[def-norm-and-normed-space]]).

[L9] Laws of finite sums and induction ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[def-finite-sum]], [[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L10] Order arithmetic: $u > 0$ gives $u^{-1} > 0$, a product of nonnegatives is nonnegative, and $t \le |t|$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 If $a = b$ then $\int_a^b f = 0$ and $\int_a^b\lVert f\rVert_2 = 0$ by the oriented convention, so clause 2 reads $0 \le 0$ and holds, while clause 1 says nothing in that case; assume $a < b$ from here on. [L1]

1.2 Each component $f_i$ is bounded and integrable on $[a,b]$, so each $f_i^{2}$ is integrable. [L1, L4]

1.3 The map $s \mapsto s^{2}$ is continuous and injective on the order-convex set $[0,\sqrt K]$, with image $[0,K]$; by the continuous inverse theorem its inverse $\varphi : [0,K] \to [0,\sqrt K]$, $\varphi(u) = \sqrt u$, is continuous on $[0,K]$. [L6, L7]

1.4 Pointwise, $\langle v, f(t)\rangle \le \bigl|\langle v,f(t)\rangle\bigr| \le \lVert v\rVert_2\,\lVert f(t)\rVert_2$ by Cauchy-Schwarz. [L8, L10]

2.1 By induction on $p \le m$, every finite sum $\sum_{i<p} f_i^{2}$ is integrable, the empty sum being the constant $0$ and each successor step adding one integrable function. Hence $g = \sum_{i<m}f_i^{2}$ is integrable. [step 1.2, L2, L9]

2.2 The real-valued function $t \mapsto \langle v, f(t)\rangle = \sum_{i<m}v_i f_i(t)$ is integrable, being a finite sum of scalar multiples of the integrable $f_i$, and by linearity applied $m$ times $\int_a^b \langle v,f\rangle = \sum_{i<m} v_i\int_a^b f_i = \sum_{i<m}v_i\,v_i = \langle v,v\rangle = \lVert v\rVert_2^{2}$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L8, L9]

3.1 $g(t) \ge 0$ for every $t$, being a finite sum of squares, and $g$ is bounded above: each $|f_i|$ is bounded by some $B_i$, so $g(t) \le \sum_{i<m}B_i^{2} =: K$. Thus $g$ takes its values in $[0,K]$. [step 2.1, L1, L9, L10]

4.1 $\lVert f(t)\rVert_2 = \sqrt{g(t)} = \varphi(g(t))$ for every $t \in [a,b]$, so $\lVert f\rVert_2 = \varphi \circ g$ is integrable on $[a,b]$; this is clause 1. [step 2.1, step 3.1, step 1.3, L5, L8]

5.1 Both sides of step 1.4 are integrable on $[a,b]$, so monotonicity and linearity give $\lVert v\rVert_2^{2} = \int_a^b\langle v,f\rangle \le \int_a^b \lVert v\rVert_2\lVert f\rVert_2 = \lVert v\rVert_2\int_a^b\lVert f\rVert_2$. [step 4.1, step 2.2, step 1.4, L2, L3]

5.2 If $v = 0$ then $\lVert v\rVert_2 = 0$, while $\int_a^b\lVert f\rVert_2 \ge 0$ because $\lVert f\rVert_2 \ge 0$ pointwise and $a<b$; so clause 2 holds in this case. [step 4.1, L3, L8]

6.1 If $v \ne 0$ then $\lVert v\rVert_2 > 0$, so multiplying the inequality of step 5.1 by the positive $1/\lVert v\rVert_2$ gives $\lVert v\rVert_2 \le \int_a^b\lVert f\rVert_2$, which is clause 2 in this case. [step 5.1, L8, L10]

7.1 The two cases of steps 5.2 and 6.1 exhaust the possibilities for $v$, so clause 2 holds; with step 4.1 both clauses are proved. [step 4.1, step 5.2, step 6.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The case split at $v = 0$ is mandatory.** Step 5.1 delivers only $\lVert v\rVert_2^{2} \le \lVert v\rVert_2 \int_a^b\lVert f\rVert_2$, and dividing by $\lVert v\rVert_2$ is illegitimate when that number is $0$. Many textbook presentations divide without comment; the missing case is genuinely separate, and it is the one where the right-hand side has to be shown nonnegative on its own.

- **Why the inner-product route rather than a componentwise estimate.** Bounding each coordinate of $\int_a^b f$ separately and reassembling gives a constant depending on $m$; the argument above gives the sharp inequality with no constant, and it uses only bilinearity, Cauchy-Schwarz and monotonicity of the integral. The companion page checks the inequality numerically on an explicit curve and shows it is strict there.

- **Clause 1 is where the hypotheses of [[thm-composition-with-a-continuous-function]] are checked, one by one:** $g$ is integrable, its values lie in a closed bounded interval, and the outer function is continuous on that interval. The order of that theorem's hypotheses matters — continuous **after** integrable — and it is respected here.
