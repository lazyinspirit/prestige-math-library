You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as
an independent adversarial proof-refuter. Return evidence only; Audit-Alpha
alone adjudicates and edits.

## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` Statement or consumer, actively search for a
counterexample or a failure in the witness or cited generated premise. A false
public claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or
materially inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is
nonfatal.

Return no more than 450 words, exactly in this shape:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS

For each defect:

```text
FINDING 1
  location: [exact section/fact/step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [exact assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]

## Statement refuted

**Refuted claim:** pointwise convergence of real-valued functions on a closed
bounded interval implies uniform convergence.

For $k\in\mathbb{N}$ define $f_k:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$ by

$$f_k(x):=x^{k+1}.$$

Then $(f_k)$ converges pointwise to the endpoint indicator

$$\chi(x):=\begin{cases}0,&0\le x<1,\\1,&x=1,\end{cases}$$

but the convergence is not uniform.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The functions $f_k(x)=x^{k+1}$ and the endpoint indicator $\chi$ on $[0,1]$.

[L1] If $|r|<1$, then $r^k\to0$ ([[lem-geometric-sequence-null]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L2] Bernoulli's inequality says $(1+t)^n\ge1+\iota(n)t$ for $t\ge-1$ and $n\in\mathbb{N}$ ([[lem-bernoulli-inequality]], [[def-canonical-natural]]).

[L3] The canonical naturals satisfy $\iota(k+1)>0$, and positive reciprocals reverse nonstrict inequalities ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

[L4] Uniform convergence requires one index after which the error is below every prescribed positive real at every point of the domain ([[def-pointwise-uniform-and-uniformly-cauchy-convergence]]).

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 If $0\le x<1$, then $|x|<1$, so [L1] gives $x^{k+1}\to0=\chi(x)$; at $x=1$, one has $f_k(1)=1=\chi(1)$ for every $k$. Thus $f_k\to\chi$ pointwise. [L1]

1.2 For each $k$, put $a_k:=\iota(k+1)>0$ and $y_k:=1-1/(2a_k)$. Then $0\le y_k<1$, so $\chi(y_k)=0$. [L3, algebra]

2.1 Apply [L2] with $n=k+1$ and $t=-1/(2a_k)$: $f_k(y_k)=\left(1-1/(2a_k)\right)^{k+1}\ge1-a_k/(2a_k)=1/2$. [step 1.2, L2, L3, algebra]

3.1 Hence $|f_k(y_k)-\chi(y_k)|\ge1/2$ for every $k$, so no index makes the error smaller than $1/2$ at every point; the convergence is not uniform. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L4]

4.1 The functions therefore satisfy the refuted claim's hypothesis and violate its conclusion. [step 1.1, step 3.1] ∎

Note that this is defined for **every** $a$, including $a = 0$. **Negative exponents.** If $a \\ne 0$ and $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ with $n \\ge 1$, set $$a^{-n} := (a^n)^{-1}.$$ **Why that is legitimate.** The right-hand side presupposes that $a^n$ is invertible, that is, that $a^n \\ne 0$. This is a proof obligation and not an observation, and it is discharged by claim 2 of [[lem-power-laws]]: for $a \\ne 0$ in a field, $a^n \\ne 0$ for every $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, proved there by induction on $n$ from the fact that a field has no zero divisors ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]). That lemma is a statement *about* the operation introduced here, so it depends on this definition and is recorded in this item's `justified_by` rather than in its `deps` (SCHEMA §3). Given $a^n \\ne 0$, the value $(a^n)^{-1}$ is a single well-determined element, because multiplicative inverses in a field are unique ([[lem-of-inverse-unique]]). **Integer exponents.** Every integer $m$ ([[def-integers]]) is either $\\iota(n)$ or $-\\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$, where $\\iota$ is the embedding $\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]], [[def-int-operations]]). This too is a citation and not a slogan: the order on $\\mathbb{Z}$ is total ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), so $m \\ge 0$ or $m < 0$; the image of $\\iota$ is exactly the set of nonnegative integers, and each of them is $\\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]); and if $m < 0$ then $-m > 0$, by compatibility of the order with addition ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), so $-m = \\iota(n)$ and $m = -\\iota(n)$, with $n$ unique because $\\iota$ is injective. The two clauses above therefore define $a^m$ for every $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ whenever $a \\ne 0$, and for every $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$ for arbitrary $a$. The clauses are consistent where they overlap: the only overlap is $m = 0$, where $-\\iota(0) = \\iota(0)$ and $(a^0)^{-1} = 1^{-1} = 1 = a^0$.",

## Definition

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]) with additive identity $0_F$ and
multiplicative identity $1_F$. Define
$\iota : \mathbb{N} \to F$ by recursion on $\mathbb{N}$
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[thm-recursion]]):

$$\iota(0) \;:=\; 0_F, \qquad \iota(n+1) \;:=\; \iota(n) + 1_F .$$

$\iota(n)$ is the **canonical natural** of $n$ in $F$. It is also written
$n \cdot 1_F$, and for $n \ge 1$ it is $1_F$ added to itself $n$ times.

**Why the notation is needed at all.** A natural number in this library is a von
Neumann natural, that is a set ([[def-natural-numbers]]), and a set is not an
element of $F$. So $1/n$, $n^{\alpha}$ and $x/n$ are not expressions of $F$ when
$n$ is a natural: what they mean is $1/\iota(n)$, $\iota(n)^{\alpha}$ and
$x/\iota(n)$. The map $\iota$ is what carries a counting number into the field,
and writing it is the whole reason a reader meets $1/\iota(k+1)$ where an
informal text would write $1/(k+1)$.

## Remarks

- **Where the index shift comes from.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
  ([[def-natural-numbers]]) and $\iota(0) = 0_F$, so $1/\iota(k)$ is undefined at
  $k = 0$. A family of reciprocals indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ is therefore written
  over $\iota(k+1)$, which is why the harmonic and telescoping families of this
  library run over $k+1$ rather than over $k$. This is bookkeeping, not a
  restriction: the values are the usual ones.

- **This definition records notation; the arithmetic is proved elsewhere.** That
  $\iota$ is strictly increasing and positive on $n \ge 1$, and that it carries
  sums to sums and products to products, is [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], stated
  for an ordered field. That lemma introduces the same element by the equivalent
  recursion $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, which
  agrees with the definition above because $\iota(1) = \iota(0) + 1_F = 1_F$.
  Nothing here is new mathematics; the definition exists so that the notation has
  a home a reader can look up.

- **The symbol $\iota$ is used in this library for other canonical maps, and this
  definition does not govern them.** It also denotes the canonical field
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to F$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), the isometric
  embedding of a metric space into a completion ([[def-metric-completion]]), and
  an inclusion map $\iota : S \to X$ of a subspace. Each of those is introduced
  where it is used and means something different from the map defined here. What
  the four share is only that each is the canonical map of its situation.

- **Fields, not just ordered fields.** The recursion needs no order, so the
  definition is stated for a field; every use in this library is in an ordered
  field, and the order is what makes $\iota$ injective
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). In a field of positive characteristic $\iota$
  is not injective, which is one reason the injectivity is a lemma rather than
  part of the definition.

## Definition

Let $a \in \mathbb{R}$, where $\mathbb{R}$ is the ambient ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]).

**Natural exponents.** By the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) applied to
the set $\mathbb{R}$, the starting element $1$ and the function
$f(x) = x \cdot a$, there is a unique function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$,
written $n \mapsto a^n$, with

$$a^0 = 1, \qquad a^{n+1} = a^n \cdot a \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Thus $a^1 = a$, $a^2 = a \cdot a$, and so on. Note that this is defined for
**every** $a$, including $a = 0$.

**Negative exponents.** If $a \ne 0$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, set

$$a^{-n} := (a^n)^{-1}.$$

**Why that is legitimate.** The right-hand side presupposes that $a^n$ is
invertible, that is, that $a^n \ne 0$. This is a proof obligation and not an
observation, and it is discharged by claim 2 of [[lem-power-laws]]: for $a \ne 0$
in a field, $a^n \ne 0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, proved there by induction on
$n$ from the fact that a field has no zero divisors ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]).
That lemma is a statement *about* the operation introduced here, so it depends on
this definition and is recorded in this item's `justified_by` rather than in its
`deps` (SCHEMA §3). Given $a^n \ne 0$, the value $(a^n)^{-1}$ is a single
well-determined element, because multiplicative inverses in a field are unique
([[lem-of-inverse-unique]]).

**Integer exponents.** Every integer $m$ ([[def-integers]]) is either
$\iota(n)$ or $-\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$, where $\iota$ is the
embedding $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]],
[[def-int-operations]]). This too is a citation and not a slogan: the order on
$\mathbb{Z}$ is total ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), so $m \ge 0$ or $m < 0$; the
image of $\iota$ is exactly the set of nonnegative integers, and each of them is
$\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]); and if $m < 0$ then
$-m > 0$, by compatibility of the order with addition ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]),
so $-m = \iota(n)$ and $m = -\iota(n)$, with $n$ unique because $\iota$ is
injective. The two clauses above therefore define $a^m$ for every
$m \in \mathbb{Z}$ whenever $a \ne 0$, and for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$ for
arbitrary $a$. The clauses are consistent where they overlap: the only overlap is
$m = 0$, where $-\iota(0) = \iota(0)$ and $(a^0)^{-1} = 1^{-1} = 1 = a^0$.

## Remarks

- **The convention $0^0 = 1$ is adopted here**, and it is not a matter of taste
  but of agreement with the recursion above: $a^0 = 1$ is the starting value for
  every $a$, exactly as the empty product is $1$ ([[def-finite-sum]]). This is
  the convention that makes the empty product, the binomial theorem, and
  polynomial notation $\sum_k c_k x^k$ work at $x = 0$ without an exception. The
  competing convention "$0^0$ undefined" belongs to contexts where $x^y$ is
  studied as a function of two *real* variables and one wants continuity, which
  is unavailable and irrelevant here: the exponent in $a^m$ is an integer, never
  a real.
- $0^n = 0$ for every $n \ge 1$, since $0^{n} = 0^{n-1} \cdot 0 = 0$, a product
  with a zero factor ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]); and
  $0^{-n}$ is not defined for $n \ge 1$, since $0$ has no inverse.
- The exponent is an integer and stays an integer. Rational exponents are a
  separate construction resting on the existence of roots
  ([[thm-nth-roots-exist]], [[def-rational-power]]), and real exponents do not
  exist in this library yet ([[rem-real-exponents-deferred]]).
- The laws $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$ are
  proved, not assumed, in [[lem-power-laws]]; the order behaviour of $a \mapsto a^n$
  is [[lem-power-monotone]].

## Definition

Let $X$ be a set and, for each $k \in \mathbb{N}$, let
$f_k : X \to \mathbb{R}$ be a real-valued function
([[def-function-space]]). Let $f : X \to \mathbb{R}$.

The sequence $(f_k)$ **converges pointwise** to $f$ on $X$ when, for every
$x \in X$, the real sequence $(f_k(x))$ converges to $f(x)$
([[def-real-limit]]). Thus the index after which
$|f_k(x)-f(x)|<\varepsilon$ may depend on both $\varepsilon$ and $x$.

The sequence $(f_k)$ **converges uniformly** to $f$ on $X$ when

$$(\forall \varepsilon>0)(\exists N\in\mathbb{N})(\forall k\ge N)(\forall x\in X)\quad |f_k(x)-f(x)|<\varepsilon,$$

where $\varepsilon$ ranges over the positive reals. Here one index $N$ serves
every point of $X$.

The sequence $(f_k)$ is **uniformly Cauchy** on $X$ when

$$(\forall \varepsilon>0)(\exists N\in\mathbb{N})(\forall m,n\ge N)(\forall x\in X)\quad |f_m(x)-f_n(x)|<\varepsilon.$$

For each of the three notions above, restricting the error to positive
rationals gives an equivalent condition. The real-error condition immediately
implies the rational-error condition. Conversely, given a real $\eta>0$,
choose $n\ge1$ with $1/n<\eta$ by
[[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]]; the condition for the positive rational
$1/n$ implies the condition for $\eta$. The real-error form is used because
it makes the uniform quantifiers transparent.

## Statement

Let $\mathbb{R}$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]), let
$x \in \mathbb{R}$ with $x \ge -1$, and let $n \in \mathbb{N}$, with powers as in
[[def-integer-power]] and with $n$ also denoting the canonical natural
$\iota(n) \in \mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[lem-of-q-embeds]]).
Then

$$(1+x)^n \ge 1 + nx,$$

and equality holds if and only if $n \le 1$ or $x = 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $\mathbb{R}$, an element $x \ge -1$ of it, and a natural number $n$, with $\iota(n) \in \mathbb{R}$ written $n$.

[L1] Definition of powers ([[def-integer-power]]): $a^0 = 1$ and $a^{n+1} = a^n a$.

[L2] Induction principle ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L3] Order and scaling: for $c \ge 0$, $u \ge v$ implies $uc \ge vc$. [[lem-of-sign-rules]] gives only the strict rule $u > v \iff uc > vc$ for $c > 0$, so this is that rule together with the case $u = v$, and with the case $c = 0$, where both sides are $0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]). Likewise adding a constant preserves the order, where [[lem-of-add-order]] again states only the strict form and the nonstrict one adds the case of equality; trichotomy is what settles those cases ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L4] Squares are nonnegative: $x^2 > 0$ for $x \ne 0$ ([[lem-of-square-positive]]), and $0^2 = 0 \cdot 0 = 0$ because a product with a zero factor vanishes ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]), which is also what makes $0 \cdot x = 0$ below; so $x^2 \ge 0$ for every $x$.

[L5] Canonical naturals: $\iota(0) = 0$, $\iota(n+1) = \iota(n) + 1$, and $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$, so $\iota(n) \ge 0$ for every $n$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[lem-of-q-embeds]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 0$: $(1+x)^0 = 1$ and $1 + 0 \cdot x = 1$, so the inequality holds with equality. [base, L1, L4, L5]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume $(1+x)^n \ge 1 + nx$. [ih]

1.3 Since $x \ge -1$ we have $1 + x \ge 0$, and this is exactly what licenses multiplying the inductive inequality by $1 + x$ without reversing it. [given, L3]

1.4 The discarded term is nonnegative: $n x^2 \ge 0$, since $x^2 \ge 0$ and $\iota(n) \ge 0$, so scaling the inequality $x^2 \ge 0$ by the nonnegative factor $\iota(n)$ gives $\iota(n) x^2 \ge \iota(n) \cdot 0 = 0$; the scaling rule, and not the nonnegativity of the two factors on its own, is what licenses this. [L3, L4, L5]

1.5 Equality analysis, the strict direction: if $n \ge 2$ and $x \ne 0$ with $x \ge -1$, then $(1+x)^n > 1 + nx$, by a second induction, on $j$, over the statement $(1+x)^{j+2} > 1 + (j+2)x$; for $j = 0$ we have $(1+x)^2 = 1 + 2x + x^2 > 1 + 2x$ because $x^2 > 0$; and assuming $(1+x)^{m} > 1 + mx$ for some $m \ge 2$, there are two possibilities: if $x = -1$ then $(1+x)^{m+1} = 0$ while $1 + (m+1)x = 1 - (m+1) = -m < 0$, and if $x > -1$ then $1 + x > 0$ and $(1+x)^{m+1} = (1+x)^{m}(1+x) > (1 + mx)(1 + x) = 1 + (m+1)x + mx^2 \ge 1 + (m+1)x$, so the strict inequality passes to $m+1$ in either case. [L1, L2, L3, L4, L5]

2.1 Multiplying the hypothesis by $1 + x \ge 0$ and expanding: $(1+x)^{n+1} = (1+x)^n (1+x) \ge (1 + nx)(1 + x) = 1 + (n+1)x + nx^2$. [step 1.2, step 1.3, L1, L3, L5]

2.2 Equality analysis, the easy direction: at $n = 0$ both sides are $1$, and at $n = 1$ both sides are $1 + x$, so equality holds whenever $n \le 1$; and if $x = 0$ both sides are $1$ for every $n$, since $(1+0)^n = 1^n = 1$. [step 1.1, L1, L5]

3.1 Hence $(1+x)^{n+1} \ge 1 + (n+1)x$, which is the claim at $n+1$. [step 2.1, step 1.4, L3]

4.1 By the induction principle the inequality $(1+x)^n \ge 1 + nx$ holds for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and every $x \ge -1$, and by steps 2.2 and 1.5 equality holds exactly when $n \le 1$ or $x = 0$. [step 1.1, step 3.1, step 2.2, step 1.5, L2, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $r \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $r^k$ be the integer power ([[def-integer-power]]).

1. If $|r| < 1$ then $(r^k)$ is **null**, that is $r^k \to 0$
   ([[def-real-limit]]).
2. If $|r| > 1$ then $(|r|^k)$ **diverges to $+\infty$**
   ([[def-divergence-to-infinity]]).

Claim 2 is stated for $|r|^k$ and not for $r^k$ on purpose: for $r < -1$ the
terms $r^k$ alternate in sign and are unbounded, so they neither converge nor
diverge to $+\infty$; what is true of them is the statement about their absolute
values.

Both claims come from Bernoulli's inequality ([[lem-bernoulli-inequality]]) and
the Archimedean property. Nothing here needs the least-upper-bound property
except through [[thm-of-archimedean]] and [[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real $r$, with integer powers as in [[def-integer-power]]; for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the symbol $n$ also denotes the canonical natural $n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ where it occurs in an arithmetic expression.

[L1] Absolute value: $|x| \ge 0$; $|x| = 0$ exactly when $x = 0$; $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; and $|x| = x$ when $x \ge 0$, so in particular $|1| = 1$ because $1 > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]], [[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] Induction principle ([[thm-induction-principle]]), and the recursion clauses $a^0 = 1$, $a^{k+1} = a^k a$ defining integer powers ([[def-integer-power]]).

[L3] Bernoulli's inequality: $(1+x)^n \ge 1 + nx$ for $x \ge -1$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[lem-bernoulli-inequality]]).

[L4] Power laws: $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$, and $a^n \ne 0$ when $a \ne 0$ ([[lem-power-laws]]).

[L5] Powers and order: $a \ge 0$ gives $a^n \ge 0$ and $a > 0$ gives $a^n > 0$; $1^n = 1$ for every $n$ ([[lem-power-monotone]]).

[L6] Reciprocals: $a > 0$ gives $a^{-1} > 0$; $0 < a < b$ gives $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]); and $0 < t < 1$ exactly when $1/t > 1$ ([[prop-of-reciprocal-order]]).

[L7] Archimedean property: for every $x \in \mathbb{R}$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $x < n$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); and for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/N < \varepsilon$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]]).

[L8] Canonical naturals: $n > 0$ for $n \ge 1$, and $m \le n$ in $\mathbb{N}$ gives $m \le n$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L9] Multiplying inequalities of nonnegatives: $0 \le a \le b$ and $0 \le c \le d$ give $ac \le bd$ ([[prop-of-multiply-inequalities]]).

[L10] Trichotomy of the order on $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L11] Convergence to $0$ and divergence to $+\infty$ for a sequence of reals; a rational test value $\varepsilon > 0$ is in particular a real one ([[def-real-limit]], [[def-divergence-to-infinity]], [[def-sequence]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 First, $|r^k| = |r|^k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, by induction: at $k = 0$ both sides are $|1| = 1$, and if $|r^k| = |r|^k$ then $|r^{k+1}| = |r^k r| = |r^k|\,|r| = |r|^k |r| = |r|^{k+1}$. [given, L1, L2]

1.2 **Case zero.** Assume $r = 0$. [given, assume-case zero]

1.3 **Case small.** Assume $0 < |r| < 1$. [given, assume-case small]

1.4 **Case large.** Assume $|r| > 1$. [given, assume-case large]

2.1 In case zero, $r^k = 0$ for every $k \ge 1$: indeed $r^1 = r^0 r = 1 \cdot 0 = 0$, and if $r^k = 0$ then $r^{k+1} = r^k r = 0$, so induction gives the claim from $k = 1$ on. [step 1.2, L2]

2.2 In case small, put $s := 1/|r|$, which is defined since $|r| \ne 0$, and $h := s - 1$. Then $s > 1$ and $h > 0$. [step 1.3, L1, L6, choose]

2.3 In case large, put $h' := |r| - 1$, so $h' > 0$ and $|r| = 1 + h'$. [step 1.4, choose]

3.1 In case zero, for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ and every $k \ge 1$ we have $|r^k - 0| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$, so $r^k \to 0$ and claim 1 holds. [step 2.1, L1, L11]

3.2 In case small, $|r|^k s^k = (|r| s)^k = 1^k = 1$, so $|r|^k = 1/s^k$, and $s^k > 0$. [step 2.2, L4, L5]

3.3 In case small, Bernoulli applied to $h > 0 \ge -1$ gives $s^k = (1+h)^k \ge 1 + kh > kh > 0$ for every $k \ge 1$, using $1 > 0$ and $kh > 0$. [step 2.2, L3, L8, L9]

3.4 In case large, Bernoulli applied to $h' > 0 \ge -1$ gives $|r|^k = (1 + h')^k \ge 1 + k h'$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.3, L3]

3.5 In case large, let $M \in \mathbb{R}$ be arbitrary and use [L7] to fix a natural $n \ge 1$ with $M/h' < n$; then $M \le n h'$, since multiplying $M/h' \le n$ by $h' > 0$ preserves the inequality. [step 2.3, L7, L9, choose]

3.6 In case small, let $\varepsilon > 0$ be rational; then $\varepsilon h > 0$, so [L7] supplies a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/N < \varepsilon h$, whence $1/(Nh) \le \varepsilon$ on multiplying by $1/h > 0$. [step 2.2, L6, L7, L9, choose]

4.1 In case small, combining steps 3.2 and 3.3: $0 < kh < s^k$ gives $|r|^k = 1/s^k < 1/(kh)$ for every $k \ge 1$. [step 3.2, step 3.3, L6]

4.2 In case large, for every $k \ge n$ we have $k h' \ge n h' \ge M$, so $|r|^k \ge 1 + k h' \ge 1 + M > M$, the last step because $1 > 0$. [step 3.4, step 3.5, L1, L8, L9]

5.1 In case small, for every $k \ge N$ we have $kh \ge Nh > 0$, hence $1/(kh) \le 1/(Nh) \le \varepsilon$, and therefore $|r^k - 0| = |r^k| = |r|^k < 1/(kh) \le \varepsilon$. [step 1.1, step 4.1, step 3.6, L6, L8, L9]

5.2 In case large, an index $n$ has been produced for an arbitrary real $M$ with $|r|^k > M$ for all $k \ge n$, which is exactly divergence to $+\infty$: claim 2 holds. [step 4.2, L11]

6.1 In case small, the rational $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary and the index $N$ was produced from it, so $r^k \to 0$ and claim 1 holds. [step 5.1, L11]

7.1 The hypothesis $|r| < 1$ of claim 1 is exhausted by cases zero and small, since $|r| \ge 0$ with $|r| = 0$ exactly when $r = 0$, so trichotomy leaves only $0 < |r| < 1$; the hypothesis $|r| > 1$ of claim 2 is case large. Both claims are therefore established. [step 3.1, step 5.2, step 6.1, L1, L10, cases: zero small or large, cases-exhaustive] ∎

## Remarks

- **The two claims are not one claim in disguise.** For $|r| > 1$ the sequence
  $(r^k)$ itself has no limiting behaviour to record when $r$ is negative: its
  terms alternate in sign and grow, so it neither converges nor diverges to
  $+\infty$ nor to $-\infty$. Stating claim 2 for $|r|^k$ is what makes it true
  as written.

- **The boundary $|r| = 1$ is excluded and is genuinely different.** For $r = 1$
  the sequence is constant $1$; for $r = -1$ it is the alternating sequence
  ([[lem-alternating-sequence]]), which is bounded and divergent
  ([[fs-bounded-implies-convergent]]). So neither claim extends to $|r| = 1$, and
  the two cases at the boundary do not even agree with each other.

- **Where this is used.** Claim 1 supplies the null sequence $c^{k}$ that makes a
  contractive sequence Cauchy ([[thm-contractive-implies-cauchy]]) and the null
  sequence $(1/10)^n$ that identifies the limit of the decimal truncations of
  $\sqrt 2$ ([[cex-cauchy-rationals-no-rational-limit]]).

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b \in F$.

1. If $a > 0$ then $a^{-1} > 0$.
2. If $0 < a < b$ then $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b \in F$.

[L1] $x > 0 \iff x \in P$; $x < 0 \iff -x \in P$; and for $x \neq 0$ exactly one of $x \in P$, $-x \in P$ holds ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Sign rules: a product of a positive and a negative is negative, a product of two positives is positive, and for $c > 0$ one has $a < b \iff ac < bc$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

[L3] $0 < 1$; in particular $1 \neq 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L4] $P$ is closed under addition, so $<$ is transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a > 0$, so $a \neq 0$ and its inverse $a^{-1}$ exists with $a \cdot a^{-1} = 1$; moreover $a^{-1} \neq 0$, since $a^{-1}$ has $a$ as its inverse while $0$ is non-invertible ($1 \neq 0$ by L3). [assume-hyp, L1, L3]

2.1 By trichotomy $a^{-1} \in P$ or $-a^{-1} \in P$; if $-a^{-1} \in P$, then $a > 0$ and $a^{-1} < 0$ give $a \cdot a^{-1} < 0$ by the sign rules, i.e. $1 < 0$, contradicting $0 < 1$; hence $a^{-1} \in P$, i.e. $a^{-1} > 0$, proving claim 1. [step 1.1, L2, L3, L1]

3.1 Assume $0 < a < b$; then $0 < b$ by transitivity, so by claim 1 both $a^{-1} > 0$ and $b^{-1} > 0$, and the sign rules give $a^{-1} b^{-1} > 0$. [assume-hyp, step 2.1, L4, L2, L1]

4.1 Multiplying $a < b$ by the positive $a^{-1} b^{-1}$ via the sign rules gives $a (a^{-1} b^{-1}) < b (a^{-1} b^{-1})$; since $a a^{-1} = 1$ and $b b^{-1} = 1$, this simplifies to $b^{-1} < a^{-1}$. [step 3.1, L2, algebra]

5.1 Together with $b^{-1} > 0$ from step 3.1, we conclude $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$, proving claim 2. [step 3.1, step 4.1] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field, with field structure as in [[def-field]], and for
$n \ge 1$ let $n \cdot 1_F$ denote the canonical natural number
$\underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$, defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$
and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$. Then for every $n \ge 1$:

- $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$;
- the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$;
- $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ and $(mn) \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F)$ for all $m, n \ge 1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ whose canonical naturals are defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, with $0 \cdot 1_F = 0$.

[L1] $0 < 1_F$ in every ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] The order is compatible with addition and positives are closed under addition: $a < b$ implies $a + c < b + c$, and $a > 0$, $b > 0$ imply $a + b > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 1$: by definition $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, and $1_F > 0$. [L1, base]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: assume $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for some fixed $n \ge 1$. [ih]

1.3 By the recursion, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F - n \cdot 1_F = 1_F > 0$, so $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$. [given, L1]

1.4 Additive identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ by the recursion, and if $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ then $(m+n+1) \cdot 1_F = (m+n) \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + (n+1) \cdot 1_F$. [given, algebra]

2.1 Inductive step: $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ is a sum of two positives, by the hypothesis and $1_F > 0$, hence $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Iterating 1.3, for $m < n$ one has $m \cdot 1_F < n \cdot 1_F$, so $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing and therefore injective on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$. [step 1.3, L2]

2.3 Multiplicative identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m \cdot 1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(1 \cdot 1_F)$, and the step $(m(n+1)) \cdot 1_F = (mn + m) \cdot 1_F = (mn) \cdot 1_F + m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F) + (m \cdot 1_F)(1_F) = (m \cdot 1_F)((n+1) \cdot 1_F)$ uses 1.4 and distributivity. [step 1.4, algebra]

3.1 By induction on 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for every $n \ge 1$; with the strict increase 2.2 and the identities 1.4, 2.3, every claim holds. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 1.4, step 2.3, discharge-induction] ∎
