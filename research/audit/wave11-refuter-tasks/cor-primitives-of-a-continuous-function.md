## Statement

Let $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be order-convex with at least two elements
([[def-interval]]) and let $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $I$
([[def-continuity-real]]). Call $G : I \to \mathbb{R}$ a **primitive of $f$ on
$I$** when $G$ is differentiable at every point of $I$ as a function on $I$ with
$G' = f$ there ([[def-derivative]]). Then:

1. **Existence.** Fix $c_0 \in I$. The function
   $$F : I \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad F(x) \;:=\; \int_{c_0}^x f$$
   is defined at every $x \in I$ ([[def-oriented-integral]],
   [[def-the-integral-function]]) and is a primitive of $f$ on $I$.
2. **Uniqueness up to a constant.** If $G_1$ and $G_2$ are primitives of $f$ on
   $I$ then there is a real $k$ with $G_1(x) = G_2(x) + k$ for every $x \in I$.
3. **Evaluation.** If $a, b \in I$ with $a < b$ and $G$ is any primitive of $f$
   on $I$, then
   $$\int_a^b f \;=\; G(b) - G(a) .$$

**The scope is exactly the continuous case, and that is not a limitation of the
proof.** An integrable function need not have a primitive, and a function with a
primitive need not be integrable; this corollary is precisely the intersection
where both fundamental theorems apply, and both witnesses are on the companion
page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An order-convex $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ with at least two elements, a continuous $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$, a base point $c_0 \in I$, and a real $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] A continuous function on a closed bounded interval with distinct endpoints is integrable there; a restriction of a continuous function is continuous ([[thm-continuous-implies-integrable]], [[def-continuity-real]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L2] Order-convexity: if $p, q \in I$ then every real between $p$ and $q$ lies in $I$, so the closed interval with endpoints $p$ and $q$ is contained in $I$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L3] $\int_p^p u = 0$, $\int_q^p u = -\int_p^q u$, and for $u$ integrable on a closed bounded interval containing $p,q,r$ one has $\int_p^q u + \int_q^r u = \int_p^r u$ ([[def-oriented-integral]], [[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]], claim 3).

[L4] First fundamental theorem: if $u$ is integrable on $[p,q]$ with $p<q$ and continuous at $c \in [p,q]$, then $x \mapsto \int_p^x u$ has derivative $u(c)$ at $c$ as a function on $[p,q]$; written out, for every real $\varepsilon>0$ there is a real $\delta>0$ with $\bigl|\bigl(\int_p^x u - \int_p^c u\bigr)/(x-c) - u(c)\bigr| < \varepsilon$ for every $x \in [p,q]$ with $0<|x-c|<\delta$ ([[thm-ftc-first-part]], [[def-derivative]], [[def-function-limit]]).

[L5] Second fundamental theorem: if $H$ is differentiable at every point of $[p,q]$ with $H'$ integrable there, then $\int_p^q H' = H(q)-H(p)$ ([[thm-ftc-second-part]]).

[L6] If $u$ is continuous on an order-convex $I$ and differentiable with $u' = 0$ at every interior point of $I$, then $u$ is constant on $I$ ([[cor-zero-derivative-implies-constant]]).

[L7] A differentiable function is continuous, and the restriction of a function differentiable at $c$ to a subset still having $c$ as a limit point is differentiable at $c$ with the same derivative; every point of a nondegenerate interval is a limit point of it ([[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]], [[def-derivative]], [[def-interval]]).

[L8] Ordered-field arithmetic and minima of two reals: the order is total and transitive, and $\min\{s,t\}$ is a real that is $\le$ both ([[def-max-min]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **$F$ is defined.** For $x \in I$ the closed interval with endpoints $c_0$ and $x$ lies in $I$ by [L2], $f$ is continuous there, hence integrable when $x \ne c_0$ by [L1], and $\int_{c_0}^{c_0} f = 0$ by [L3]; so $F(x)$ names a real for every $x \in I$. [given, L1, L2, L3]

1.2 **A closed neighbourhood inside $I$.** Fix $c \in I$. If some element of $I$ is $< c$, choose $u \in I$ with $u < c$; otherwise put $u := c$. If some element of $I$ is $> c$, choose $v \in I$ with $v > c$; otherwise put $v := c$. Not both $u = c$ and $v = c$, since $I$ would then have $c$ as its only element; so $u < v$, and $[u,v] \subseteq I$ by [L2]. [given, L2, choose]

1.3 **Claim 2.** Let $G_1, G_2$ be primitives of $f$ on $I$ and put $u := G_1 - G_2$. Then $u$ is differentiable at every point of $I$ with $u' = f - f = 0$ there, in particular at every interior point of $I$, and $u$ is continuous on $I$ by [L7]; so [L6] gives a real $k$ with $u \equiv k$. [L6, L7]

2.1 Put $\eta := \min\{\,c-u,\ v-c\,\}$ if $u<c$ and $c<v$, $\eta := v-c$ if $u = c$, and $\eta := c-u$ if $v = c$; in every case $\eta > 0$. [step 1.2, L8, construct]

2.2 $f$ is integrable on $[u,v]$ by [L1], and for $x \in [u,v]$, [L3] applied to the points $c_0, u, x$ inside the closed interval with endpoints $\min\{c_0,u\}$ and $\max\{c_0,v\}$, which lies in $I$ by [L2], gives $F(x) = F(u) + \int_u^x f$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1, L2, L3]

3.1 **Every point of $I$ within $\eta$ of $c$ lies in $[u,v]$.** Let $x \in I$ with $|x-c| < \eta$. If $x < c$ then $I$ has an element below $c$, so $u < c$ and $\eta \le c-u$, whence $x > c-\eta \ge u$. If $x > c$ then symmetrically $x < c+\eta \le v$. And $u \le c \le v$ covers $x = c$. So $u \le x \le v$. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L8]

3.2 Hence for $x \in [u,v]$ with $x \ne c$, $\bigl(F(x)-F(c)\bigr)/(x-c) = \bigl(\int_u^x f - \int_u^c f\bigr)/(x-c)$, the constant $F(u)$ cancelling. [step 2.2, algebra]

3.3 By [L4] applied on $[u,v]$ at the point $c$, fix a real $\delta > 0$ with $\bigl|\bigl(\int_u^x f - \int_u^c f\bigr)/(x-c) - f(c)\bigr| < \varepsilon$ for every $x \in [u,v]$ with $0<|x-c|<\delta$, and put $\delta' := \min\{\delta,\eta\} > 0$. [step 2.2, given, L1, L4, L8, choose]

4.1 Every $x \in I$ with $0 < |x-c| < \delta'$ lies in $[u,v]$ by step 3.1, so by step 3.2 and step 3.3, $\bigl|\bigl(F(x)-F(c)\bigr)/(x-c) - f(c)\bigr| < \varepsilon$. [step 3.1, step 3.2, step 3.3]

5.1 As $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary and $c$ is a limit point of $I$ by [L7], $F$ is differentiable at $c$ with $F'(c) = f(c)$; since $c \in I$ was arbitrary, $F$ is a primitive of $f$ on $I$, which is claim 1. [step 1.2, step 4.1, L7]

6.1 **Claim 3.** Let $a<b$ in $I$ and let $G$ be a primitive of $f$ on $I$. Then $[a,b] \subseteq I$ by [L2], the restriction of $G$ to $[a,b]$ is differentiable at every point of $[a,b]$ with derivative $f$ there by [L7], and $f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ by [L1]; so [L5] gives $\int_a^b f = G(b)-G(a)$. [L1, L2, L5, L7] ∎

## Remarks

- **Steps 1.2, 2.1 and 3.1 are the only work beyond citing the two fundamental theorems.** [[thm-ftc-first-part]] is stated on a closed bounded interval, while $I$ here may be open, half-open or unbounded, so the derivative it produces is the derivative of a *restriction*. What those steps supply is a closed subinterval $[u,v] \subseteq I$ that contains all points of $I$ within $\eta$ of $c$, after which the difference quotients of $F$ and of the restriction agree on a punctured neighbourhood and the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ statement transfers verbatim.

- **"Two primitives differ by a constant" is not re-minted here.** [[cor-zero-derivative-implies-constant]] already states exactly that, in its second clause, for functions with equal derivatives on an order-convex domain; claim 2 is that statement applied to $G_1 - G_2$.

- **Order-convexity of $I$ is essential to claim 2 and harmless elsewhere.** On a domain in two pieces a function may be constant on each with different constants, which is why [[cor-zero-derivative-implies-constant]] carries the same hypothesis. Claims 1 and 3 use it only to know that closed subintervals spanned by points of $I$ lie in $I$.

- **Forward references, orientation only.** The two witnesses bounding the scope of this corollary are [[cex-an-integrable-function-with-no-primitive]] and [[cex-a-function-with-a-primitive-that-is-not-integrable]] on the companion page; nothing above depends on either.

At\n   an isolated point of its domain a function is neither differentiable nor\n   non-differentiable here: the question is not posed.\n\n**The limit sees only $A \\setminus \\{c\\}$, so how the difference quotient is\nextended to $c$ is irrelevant.** Let $Q : A \\to \\mathbb{R}$ agree with\n$q_{f,c}$ at every point of $A \\setminus \\{c\\}$, and let $L \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nThen $\\lim_{x \\to c} Q(x) = L$ if and only if $\\lim_{x \\to c} q_{f,c}(x) = L$.\nBoth conditions read: for every real $\\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real\n$\\delta > 0$ such that every point $x$ of the relevant domain with\n$0 < |x - c| < \\delta$ satisfies $|{\\cdot} - L| < \\varepsilon$\n([[def-function-limit]]). The clause $0 < |x - c|$ removes $x = c$ from both\nquantifiers, so in both cases the points quantified over are exactly the\n$x \\in A \\setminus \\{c\\}$ with $0 < |x - c| < \\delta$, at which $Q$ and\n$q_{f,c}$ take the same value. The two conditions are the same condition.\n\n**Differentiability on a set.** For $S \\subseteq A$, $f$ is **differentiable on\n$S$** when it is differentiable at every $c \\in S$; implicit in that phrase is\nthat every point of $S$ is a limit point of $A$. $f$ is **differentiable** when\nit is differentiable on the whole of $A$.\n\n**Restriction of the domain.** Let $B \\subseteq A$, let $c \\in B$ and suppose\n$c$ is a limit point of $B$. If $f$ is differentiable at $c$, then so is the\nrestriction $f|_B : B \\to \\mathbb{R}$, and\n\n$$(f|_B)'(c) \\;=\\; f'(c) .$$\n\nIndeed $B \\setminus \\{c\\} \\subseteq A \\setminus \\{c\\}$; the displayed identity\nof punctured neighbourhoods above, applied to $B$, shows that $c$ is a limit\npoint of $B \\setminus \\{c\\}$; the difference quotient $q_{f|_B, c}$ is the\nrestriction of $q_{f,c}$ to $B \\setminus \\{c\\}$, since $f|_B(c) = f(c)$; and\nclaim 2 of [[lem-limit-is-local]] carries the limit to that restriction.\n\n**Every point of a nondegenerate interval is a limit point of it.** Let\n$J \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ be order-convex ([[def-interval]]) with at least two\nelements and let $p \\in J$. Choose $q \\in J$ with $q \\ne p$, and let a real\n$\\varepsilon > 0$ be given. If $p < q$, put $y := p + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\min\\{\\varepsilon,\\ q - p\\}$;\nthen $p < y$, and $y - p \\le \\tfrac{1}{2}(q-p) < q - p$, so $p < y < q$ and\norder-convexity gives $y \\in J$, while $0 < |y - p| < \\varepsilon$. If $q < p$,\nthe point $y := p - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\min\\{\\varepsilon,\\ p - q\\}$ serves in the same\nway. So $N^{*}_{\\varepsilon}(p) \\cap J \\ne \\varnothing$ for every real\n$\\varepsilon > 0$, that is, $p$ is a limit point of $J$\n([[def-limit-point-r]]).\n\nConsequently, for $f$ defined on a nondegenerate interval $I$, the symbol\n$f'(c)$ is meaningful at **every** $c \\in I$, endpoints included. At an endpoint\nthe difference quotient is taken over the points of $I$ lying on the one side\nthat is available, so what other texts call a one-sided derivative is, here,\nsimply the derivative of $f$ on $I$.",

The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or\nsides written with $\\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.\n\n**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,\nand **nondegenerate** when it has at least two.

It holds because\n$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to\nboth sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside\n$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.\n\n**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \\le b$, which is\nexactly the condition making them nonempty.

## Statement refuted

**False claim:** if $G : [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ is differentiable at every point of
$[0,1]$ ([[def-derivative]]), then $G'$ is Riemann integrable on $[0,1]$ (so that
$\int_0^1 G' = G(1)-G(0)$ makes sense).

The claim is false. Put

$$\phi(t) \;:=\; t^{2}(1-t)^{2} \qquad (t \in \mathbb{R}),$$

a polynomial with $\phi(0)=\phi(1)=0$ and $\phi'(0)=\phi'(1)=0$, and for
$n \in \mathbb{N}$ set

$$\alpha_n := \frac{1}{\iota(n+2)}, \qquad h_n := \frac{1}{\iota(n+2)^{4}}, \qquad c_n := \frac{1}{\iota(n+2)^{2}}, \qquad \beta_n := \alpha_n + h_n, \qquad I_n := [\alpha_n,\beta_n]$$

([[def-canonical-natural]], [[def-integer-power]]). The intervals $I_n$ are
pairwise disjoint and lie in $(0,1]$, and

$$G : [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad G(x) \;:=\; \begin{cases} c_n\,\phi\!\left(\dfrac{x-\alpha_n}{h_n}\right) & x \in I_n \text{ for some } n, \\[6pt] 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

is differentiable at **every** point of $[0,1]$, while

$$G'\!\left(\alpha_n + \tfrac{1}{4}h_n\right) \;=\; \frac{3}{16}\,\iota(n+2)^{2} ,$$

so $G'$ is unbounded on $[0,1]$ and therefore has no Darboux sums at all
([[def-darboux-sums]]) and is not Riemann integrable.

**The construction is entirely polynomial, and deliberately so.** The classical
witness is $x^{2}\sin(1/x^{2})$; the trigonometric functions are built on a later
page of this library, so a bump glued from a single quartic is used instead. Only
one bump is nonzero near any point of $(0,1]$, so no series converges anywhere in
the argument and no limit function is formed.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The polynomial $\phi(t) = t^{2}(1-t)^{2}$, the numbers $\alpha_n, h_n, c_n, \beta_n$ and intervals $I_n$ above, the function $G$ above, and a real $\varepsilon>0$.

[L1] Polynomial calculus: every polynomial function is differentiable at every real and continuous there, with $(t^{n})' = \iota(n)t^{\,n-1}$ for $n \ge 1$, and sums, scalar multiples and products differentiate by the usual rules ([[lem-derivative-of-a-power]], [[thm-algebra-of-derivatives]], [[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], [[def-derivative]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L2] Chain rule, and the derivative of an affine reparametrisation: $y \mapsto \psi((y-\alpha)/h)$ has derivative $\psi'((y-\alpha)/h)/h$ for $h \ne 0$ ([[thm-chain-rule]], [[thm-algebra-of-derivatives]]).

[L3] $\iota(n+2) \ge 2 > 1$, $\iota$ is increasing on $\mathbb{N}$, $\iota(m) < \iota(n)$ for $m<n$, and for every real $w$ there is a natural $n$ with $w < \iota(n+2)$; also $\iota(n)^{k} \ge \iota(n)$ for $k \ge 1$ when $\iota(n)\ge 1$ ([[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[thm-of-archimedean]], [[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[lem-power-monotone]], claims 3 and 4).

[L4] If both one-sided limits of a function at $c$ exist and are equal to $L$, the two-sided limit exists and equals $L$ ([[thm-two-sided-limit-iff-both-one-sided]], [[def-one-sided-limits]], [[def-function-limit]]).

[L5] Locality of limits: two functions on $A$ agreeing on a punctured neighbourhood of $c$ have the same limit behaviour at $c$; and a derivative survives restricting the domain provided the smaller domain still accumulates at the point ([[lem-limit-is-local]], [[def-derivative]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L6] Every point of a nondegenerate interval is a limit point of it ([[def-derivative]], [[def-interval]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L7] Darboux sums, and therefore Riemann integrability, require a bounded function ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-bounded-set]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L8] A nonempty finite set of reals has a least element ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L9] Ordered-field arithmetic: $t(1-t) \le 1/4$ for every real $t$, since $(t - 1/2)^{2} \ge 0$; a positive real has a positive inverse; multiplying an inequality by a positive real preserves it; the order is total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-power-monotone]], claim 1).

[L10] If $H$ is differentiable at every point of $[p,q]$ with $H'$ integrable there, then $\int_p^q H' = H(q)-H(p)$ ([[thm-ftc-second-part]]).

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L1], $\phi$ is differentiable everywhere with $\phi'(t) = 2t(1-t)^{2} - 2t^{2}(1-t) = 2t(1-t)(1-2t)$; in particular $\phi(0)=\phi(1)=0$ and $\phi'(0)=\phi'(1)=0$, and $\phi'(1/4) = 2\cdot\tfrac14\cdot\tfrac34\cdot\tfrac12 = \tfrac{3}{16}$. [L1, L9]

1.2 For $t \in [0,1]$, $0 \le \phi(t) = \bigl(t(1-t)\bigr)^{2} \le (1/4)^{2} = 1/16$, by [L9]. [L9]

1.3 Each $\alpha_n, h_n, c_n$ is a positive real, $h_n \le \alpha_n$ and $c_n \le \alpha_n$ because $\iota(n+2) > 1$, and $\alpha_n \le 1/2$; so $I_n \subseteq (0,1]$, since $\beta_n = \alpha_n + h_n \le 2\alpha_n \le 1$. [given, L3, L9]

2.1 **The $I_n$ are pairwise disjoint.** For $n \ge 1$, $\alpha_{n-1}-\alpha_n = 1/\bigl(\iota(n+1)\iota(n+2)\bigr)$ while $h_n = 1/\iota(n+2)^{4}$, and $\iota(n+2)^{4} > \iota(n+1)\iota(n+2)$ because $\iota(n+2)^{3} \ge 2\,\iota(n+2) > \iota(n+1)$ by [L3]; so $\beta_n < \alpha_{n-1}$. Since $(\alpha_n)$ is strictly decreasing, $m < n$ gives $\beta_n < \alpha_{n-1} \le \alpha_m$, and $I_n$ lies strictly below $I_m$. [step 1.3, L3, L9]

2.2 For each $n$ define the polynomial $\Phi_n(y) := c_n\,\phi\bigl((y-\alpha_n)/h_n\bigr)$ on $\mathbb{R}$. By [L1] and [L2] it is differentiable everywhere with $\Phi_n'(y) = (c_n/h_n)\,\phi'\bigl((y-\alpha_n)/h_n\bigr)$, and $\Phi_n(\alpha_n)=\Phi_n(\beta_n)=0$, $\Phi_n'(\alpha_n)=\Phi_n'(\beta_n)=0$ by step 1.1. [step 1.1, L1, L2, construct]

2.3 **Differentiability at a point of $(0,1]$ outside every $I_n$.** Let $x \in (0,1]$ with $x \notin I_m$ for every $m$. By [L3] fix $N$ with $2/x < \iota(N+2)$, so $2/\iota(N+2) < x$; for $m \ge N$, $\beta_m \le 2\alpha_m = 2/\iota(m+2) \le 2/\iota(N+2) < x$ by step 1.3 and [L3]. [step 1.3, L3, L9, choose]

3.1 So $G$ is a well-defined function on $[0,1]$, no $x$ lying in two of the $I_n$. [step 2.1, given]

3.2 **Gaps around the endpoints.** For each $n$, $(\beta_{n+1}, \alpha_n)$ meets no $I_m$: for $m \le n$ one has $\alpha_m \ge \alpha_n$ by step 2.1, and for $m \ge n+1$ one has $\beta_m \le \beta_{n+1}$, again by step 2.1. Likewise $(\beta_n, \alpha_{n-1})$ meets no $I_m$ for $n \ge 1$, and $(\beta_0, 1]$ meets none. [step 2.1, L3]

3.3 The finitely many closed intervals $I_0,\dots,I_{N-1}$ do not contain $x$, so each of the positive reals $|x-\alpha_m|$ and $|x-\beta_m|$ for $m<N$, together with $x - 2/\iota(N+2)$, forms a nonempty finite set of positive reals; let $\rho$ be its least element, which is positive by [L8]. [step 2.3, L8, L9, choose]

4.1 $G$ agrees with $\Phi_n$ on $I_n$ and with the zero function off $\bigcup_m I_m$; in particular $G(\alpha_n) = G(\beta_n) = 0$ and $G \ge 0$ everywhere. [step 3.1, step 2.2, L9]

5.1 **Differentiability at an interior point of a bump.** Let $x \in (\alpha_n,\beta_n)$. The difference quotients of $G$ and of $\Phi_n$ at $x$ agree on the punctured neighbourhood $0 < |y-x| < \min\{x-\alpha_n,\ \beta_n-x\}$ inside $[0,1]$, so by [L5] and step 2.2, $G$ is differentiable at $x$ with $G'(x) = \Phi_n'(x)$. [step 2.2, step 4.1, L5, L6, L8]

5.2 **Differentiability at a left endpoint $\alpha_n$.** On the right, $G$ agrees with $\Phi_n$ on $[\alpha_n,\beta_n]$ and $G(\alpha_n) = \Phi_n(\alpha_n)$, so the right-hand limit of the difference quotient is $\Phi_n'(\alpha_n) = 0$ by [L5] and step 2.2. On the left, $G$ vanishes on $(\beta_{n+1},\alpha_n]$ by step 3.2 and step 4.1, so the quotient is identically $0$ there and its left-hand limit is $0$. By [L4], $G'(\alpha_n) = 0$. [step 2.2, step 4.1, step 3.2, L4, L5, L6]

5.3 **Differentiability at a right endpoint $\beta_n$.** Symmetrically: on the left $G$ agrees with $\Phi_n$, giving limit $\Phi_n'(\beta_n) = 0$; on the right $G$ vanishes on $[\beta_n,\alpha_{n-1})$ when $n \ge 1$ and on $[\beta_0,1]$ when $n = 0$, by step 3.2, giving limit $0$. By [L4], $G'(\beta_n) = 0$. [step 2.2, step 4.1, step 3.2, L4, L5, L6]

5.4 Then $G$ vanishes on $(x-\rho,x+\rho)\cap[0,1]$, so its difference quotient at $x$ is identically $0$ there and $G'(x) = 0$ by [L5] and [L6]. [step 2.3, step 3.3, step 4.1, L5, L6]

5.5 **Differentiability at $0$.** For $y \in (0,1]$: if $y \notin \bigcup_m I_m$ then $G(y)/y = 0$; and if $y \in I_m$ then $0 \le G(y) \le c_m/16$ by step 1.2 and step 4.1 and $y \ge \alpha_m$, so $0 \le G(y)/y \le c_m/(16\,\alpha_m) = 1/\bigl(16\,\iota(m+2)\bigr)$. [step 1.2, step 4.1, L9]

6.1 Given $\varepsilon>0$, fix by [L3] a natural $N$ with $1/\varepsilon < \iota(N+2)$ and put $\delta := \alpha_N > 0$. If $0 < y < \delta$ and $y \in I_m$ then $\alpha_m \le y < \alpha_N$, so $\iota(N+2) < \iota(m+2)$ by [L3], and step 5.5 gives $|G(y)/y| \le 1/\bigl(16\,\iota(m+2)\bigr) < \varepsilon$; otherwise $G(y)/y = 0$. [step 5.5, L3, L9, choose]

6.2 **$G'$ is unbounded.** Put $u_n := \alpha_n + h_n/4$, an interior point of $I_n$; by step 5.1 and step 2.2, $G'(u_n) = (c_n/h_n)\phi'(1/4) = \iota(n+2)^{2}\cdot\tfrac{3}{16}$, using $c_n/h_n = \iota(n+2)^{4}/\iota(n+2)^{2} = \iota(n+2)^{2}$. Given a real $M \ge 0$, [L3] supplies $n$ with $\tfrac{16}{3}M < \iota(n+2) \le \iota(n+2)^{2}$, so $G'(u_n) > M$. [step 1.1, step 2.2, step 5.1, L3, L9]

7.1 So the difference quotient of $G$ at $0$, which is $y \mapsto G(y)/y$ on $(0,1]$, tends to $0$; hence $G$ is differentiable at $0$ with $G'(0) = 0$ by [L6]. [step 6.1, L6]

8.1 By steps 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 and 7.1, $G$ is differentiable at every point of $[0,1]$: every $x$ is either $0$, or an interior point of some $I_n$, or an endpoint of some $I_n$, or a point of $(0,1]$ outside every $I_n$. [step 5.1, step 5.2, step 5.3, step 5.4, step 7.1, L9]

9.1 Hence $G'$ is a function on $[0,1]$ that is not bounded, so it has no Darboux sums and is not Riemann integrable on $[0,1]$ by [L7]; the claim is false, and $\int_0^1 G'$ is an undefined symbol, so [L10] gives nothing here. [step 8.1, step 6.2, L7, L10] ∎

## Remarks

- **Only one bump is active near any point of $(0,1]$, and that is what makes every step finite.** The intervals $I_n$ accumulate only at $0$, so a point of $(0,1]$ has a neighbourhood meeting at most one of them (steps 3.2 and 3.3), and the only place where infinitely many bumps are seen at once is the origin, where step 5.5 controls all of them by a single estimate. No series is summed anywhere.

- **The two exponents are what the construction turns on.** Differentiability at $0$ needs $c_n/\alpha_n \to 0$, and unboundedness of $G'$ needs $c_n/h_n \to \infty$; with $\alpha_n = 1/\iota(n+2)$ the choices $c_n = \alpha_n^{2}$ and $h_n = \alpha_n^{4}$ give $c_n/\alpha_n = \alpha_n \to 0$ and $c_n/h_n = \alpha_n^{-2} \to \infty$. Any pair of exponents with the same two properties would do; these are verified explicitly in steps 6.1 and 6.2 because the construction is only as good as those two inequalities.

- **What this refutes and what it does not.** It refutes the claim that every derivative is Riemann integrable, hence the naive reading of [[thm-ftc-second-part]] with its integrability hypothesis deleted. It says nothing about whether $G'$ has a primitive — it does, namely $G$ — and nothing about the sharp class of functions for which $\int_a^b G' = G(b)-G(a)$ holds, which this library records but does not prove ([[rem-integral-conventions-and-scope]]).

## Statement refuted

**False claim:** every Riemann integrable function on a closed bounded interval
has a primitive there, that is, is the derivative of some function on that
interval.

Let $s : [-1,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ be the sign function,

$$s(x) \;:=\; \begin{cases} -1 & -1 \le x < 0, \\ 0 & x = 0, \\ 1 & 0 < x \le 1. \end{cases}$$

Then $s$ is Riemann integrable on $[-1,1]$ with $\int_{-1}^{1} s = 0$, and there
is **no** $G : [-1,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ differentiable at every point of $[-1,1]$
with $G' = s$.

**The integral function of $s$ is $F(x) = |x| - 1$**, which is differentiable at
every point of $[-1,1]$ except $x = 0$ — exactly the one point where $s$ is
discontinuous. That is consistent with [[thm-ftc-first-part]], which claims
$F'(c) = s(c)$ only at points of continuity of $s$, and it is what the refutation
below turns into a contradiction.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The sign function $s$ on $[-1,1]$ and its integral function $F(x) = \int_{-1}^{x} s$.

[A1] There is $G : [-1,1] \to \mathbb{R}$, differentiable at every point of $[-1,1]$ as a function on $[-1,1]$, with $G'(x) = s(x)$ for every $x \in [-1,1]$.

[L1] A bounded function on $[p,q]$ with at most finitely many discontinuities is Riemann integrable there ([[thm-finitely-many-discontinuities-integrable]], [[def-bounded-set]], [[def-darboux-integral]], [[def-classification-of-discontinuities]]).

[L2] Changing an integrable function at finitely many points changes neither its integrability nor its integral, and $\int_p^q c = c(q-p)$ for a constant ([[lem-changing-a-function-at-finitely-many-points]], [[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]]).

[L3] Additivity, in the oriented form valid for arbitrary points ([[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]], claim 3, [[def-oriented-integral]], [[def-the-integral-function]]).

[L4] If $u$ is continuous on an order-convex $I$ and differentiable with $u' = 0$ at every interior point of $I$, then $u$ is constant on $I$ ([[cor-zero-derivative-implies-constant]], [[def-interval]]).

[L5] A function differentiable at a point is continuous there, and a restriction to a subinterval still having the point as a limit point is differentiable there with the same derivative; every point of a nondegenerate interval is a limit point of it ([[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]], [[def-derivative]], [[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L6] If both one-sided limits of a function at $c$ exist and differ, the two-sided limit does not exist ([[thm-two-sided-limit-iff-both-one-sided]], [[def-one-sided-limits]], [[def-function-limit]]).

[L7] Absolute value: $|x| = x$ for $x \ge 0$ and $|x| = -x$ for $x \le 0$; $|x|/x = 1$ for $x>0$ and $= -1$ for $x<0$ ([[def-abs-value]], [[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 $s$ is bounded, with $|s| \le 1$, and continuous at every point of $[-1,1]$ other than $0$: near a point $x \ne 0$ it is locally constant. So $s$ is integrable on $[-1,1]$, and likewise on $[-1,0]$ and on $[0,1]$, by [L1]. [given, L1]

1.2 **Assume [A1].** Then $G' = s$ everywhere on $[-1,1]$. [assume-contra, A1]

2.1 On $[-1,0]$ the function $s$ agrees with the constant $-1$ except at the single point $0$, so $\int_{-1}^{0} s = -1\cdot(0-(-1)) = -1$ by [L2]; on $[0,1]$ it agrees with the constant $1$ except at $0$, so $\int_0^1 s = 1$. [step 1.1, L2]

2.2 On $I_{+} := [0,1]$ the function $u_{+}(x) := G(x) - x$ is continuous, by [L5], and differentiable at every interior point $x \in (0,1)$ with $u_{+}'(x) = s(x) - 1 = 0$; so $u_{+}$ is constant on $[0,1]$ by [L4], say $G(x) = x + c_1$ there. [step 1.2, L4, L5, choose]

2.3 On $I_{-} := [-1,0]$ the function $u_{-}(x) := G(x) + x$ is continuous and differentiable at every $x \in (-1,0)$ with $u_{-}'(x) = s(x)+1 = 0$; so $G(x) = -x + c_2$ on $[-1,0]$. [step 1.2, L4, L5, choose]

3.1 By [L3], $\int_{-1}^{1} s = \int_{-1}^{0} s + \int_0^1 s = -1 + 1 = 0$. [step 2.1, L3]

3.2 By [L3] again, $F(x) = \int_{-1}^{x} s$ equals $-1 + x$ for $x \in [0,1]$ and equals $-(x-(-1)) = -x-1$ for $x \in [-1,0]$, by [L2] applied on the relevant piece; in both cases $F(x) = |x| - 1$ by [L7]. [step 2.1, L2, L3, L7]

3.3 Evaluating both formulas at $x = 0$ gives $c_1 = G(0) = c_2$; write $c$ for the common value, so $G(x) = |x| + c$ for every $x \in [-1,1]$ by [L7]. [step 2.2, step 2.3, L7]

4.1 The difference quotient of $G$ at $0$ is $x \mapsto (G(x)-G(0))/x = |x|/x$, which equals $1$ for $x > 0$ and $-1$ for $x < 0$ by [L7]; so its right-hand limit at $0$ is $1$ and its left-hand limit is $-1$. [step 3.3, L7]

5.1 By [L6] the two-sided limit of that quotient at $0$ does not exist, so $G$ is not differentiable at $0$; this contradicts [A1]. [step 4.1, A1, L6]

6.1 Hence no such $G$ exists: $s$ is integrable on $[-1,1]$ by step 1.1 and has no primitive there, so the claim is false. [step 1.1, step 3.1, step 5.1, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Darboux's theorem is not used.** The slick argument — a derivative has the intermediate value property, and $s$ does not — rests on Darboux's theorem on the intermediate value property of derivatives. The refutation above uses only [[cor-zero-derivative-implies-constant]] and the one-sided limits of a difference quotient, both already published.

- **The tension with the first fundamental theorem is only apparent.** $F$ *is* differentiable with $F' = s$ at every point of $[-1,1]$ except $0$, which is exactly what [[thm-ftc-first-part]] promises, since $s$ is continuous exactly off $0$. What fails is the existence of *any* function differentiable at $0$ too with derivative $s(0)$ there, and step 4.1 shows the obstruction is the jump of $s$ at $0$, not a defect of $F$.

- **The value $s(0)$ is irrelevant to both halves.** Changing it changes neither the integral, by [[lem-changing-a-function-at-finitely-many-points]], nor the conclusion of step 5.1, which shows $G$ is not differentiable at $0$ at all and therefore cannot have any prescribed derivative there.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$ be a
limit point of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]). If $f$ is differentiable at $c$
([[def-derivative]]) then $f$ is continuous at $c$ ([[def-continuity-real]]).

Consequently, if $f$ is differentiable on a set $S \subseteq A$ then $f$ is
continuous at every point of $S$.

**No converse is asserted, and none holds.** Continuity at $c$ does not give
differentiability at $c$, and the standard witness is worked out on the
companion page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and a point $c \in A$ that is a limit point of $A$ at which $f$ is differentiable ([[def-derivative]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L1] Carathéodory's characterisation ([[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]]): since $f$ is differentiable at the limit point $c$ of $A$, there is $\varphi : A \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $c$, with $f(x) - f(c) = \varphi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in A$, and $\varphi(c) = f'(c)$.

[L2] Algebra of continuous functions ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]]): sums, scalar multiples and products of functions continuous at a point of the common domain are continuous there (claim 1); and every constant function on $A$ and the identity $x \mapsto x$ on $A$ are continuous at every point of $A$ (claim 5).

[L3] Continuity of $f$ at $c$ is the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ condition of [[def-continuity-real]], and continuity on a set is continuity at each of its points.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Fix a function $\varphi : A \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $c$, with $f(x) - f(c) = \varphi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in A$. [L1, choose]

1.2 The identity $x \mapsto x$ on $A$ and every constant function on $A$ are continuous at $c$; hence so is $x \mapsto x - c$, which is the sum of the identity and the constant function with value $-c$. [L2]

2.1 The pointwise product $x \mapsto \varphi(x)(x - c)$ is continuous at $c$, being the product of two functions on $A$ continuous at $c$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L2]

3.1 For every $x \in A$ one has $f(x) = f(c) + \varphi(x)(x - c)$, so $f$ is the sum of the constant function with value $f(c)$ and the product of step 2.1. [step 1.1, L1]

4.1 A sum of two functions continuous at $c$ is continuous at $c$, so $f$ is continuous at $c$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L2, L3]

5.1 The point $c$ was an arbitrary point of $A$, a limit point of $A$, at which $f$ is differentiable; applying step 4.1 at every point of a set $S \subseteq A$ on which $f$ is differentiable gives continuity of $f$ at every point of $S$. [step 3.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the work actually is.** None of it is here. Carathéodory's characterisation already replaces the quotient by a product, and a product is visibly small when one factor is bounded near $c$ and the other tends to $0$; the algebra of continuous functions packages exactly that. A direct proof from the quotient would multiply and divide by $x - c$ and would have to say why that is legal, which is the same observation in a less convenient place.

- **The converse fails.** $x \mapsto |x|$ is continuous at $0$ and not differentiable there, which is [[cex-absolute-value-is-not-differentiable-at-zero]] on the companion page. So continuity is strictly weaker, and the gap is not exotic: it opens at a single corner.

- **What is *not* claimed.** Nothing here says that a function differentiable on a set has a continuous derivative, and nothing here says that $f'$ is defined anywhere except where it was assumed to be. Both are separate questions, and neither is settled on this page.

## Statement

Let $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be order-convex ([[def-interval]]) and let
$f : I \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $I$ ([[def-continuity-real]]) and
differentiable at every point of $I$ that is interior to $I$
([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[def-derivative]]), with

$$f'(x) = 0 \qquad \text{at every interior point } x \text{ of } I .$$

Then $f$ is constant on $I$: there is a real $k$ with $f(x) = k$ for every
$x \in I$.

Consequently, if $f, g : I \to \mathbb{R}$ are both continuous on $I$ and both
differentiable at every interior point of $I$, with $f'(x) = g'(x)$ at every
interior point $x$, then there is a real $k$ with

$$f(x) \;=\; g(x) + k \qquad \text{for every } x \in I .$$

**Order-convexity of $I$ is essential and is not a convenience.** The
conclusion is false on a domain that falls into separate pieces, since a
function may be constant on each piece with different constants; nothing in the
proof would survive, because the mean value theorem is applied to the segment
joining two points of the domain and that segment must lie in the domain.

**The hypothesis is imposed only at interior points.** At an endpoint of $I$
nothing is asked at all: $f$ need not be differentiable there, and the proof
never evaluates a difference quotient at an endpoint, since it applies the mean
value theorem on a segment $[u,v] \subseteq I$ and uses the derivative only at
points of $(u,v)$, all of which are interior to $I$. What is *not* meant is that
the derivative at an endpoint is free to be nonzero: once $f$ is known to be
constant its difference quotient at an endpoint is constantly $0$, so wherever
$f'$ exists at an endpoint it is $0$ too. That is a consequence of the theorem,
not a hypothesis of it.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An order-convex $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a function $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous on $I$ and differentiable with vanishing derivative at every interior point of $I$; for the second claim also a second such function $g$ with $f' = g'$ at every interior point.

[L1] Mean value theorem ([[cor-mean-value-theorem]]): for $u < v$ and $h : [u,v] \to \mathbb{R}$ continuous on $[u,v]$ and differentiable at every point of $(u,v)$, there is $c \in (u,v)$ with $h(v) - h(u) = h'(c)(v-u)$.

[L2] Order-convexity ([[def-interval]]): if $u, v \in I$ and $u \le z \le v$ then $z \in I$; so $u, v \in I$ with $u \le v$ gives $[u,v] \subseteq I$.

[L3] For $u < v$ in $I$ and $x \in (u,v)$, the point $x$ is interior to $I$: put $\varepsilon := \min\{x - u,\ v - x\}$, a positive real; every $y$ with $|y - x| < \varepsilon$ satisfies $u < y < v$, so $N_{\varepsilon}(x) \subseteq (u,v) \subseteq [u,v] \subseteq I$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L4] Restriction of the domain ([[def-derivative]]): if $B \subseteq A$, if $p \in B$ is a limit point of $B$ and if $h : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is differentiable at $p$, then $h|_B$ is differentiable at $p$ with $(h|_B)'(p) = h'(p)$. Moreover every point of an order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ with at least two elements is a limit point of it ([[def-derivative]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L5] Continuity passes to a subset of the domain: if $B \subseteq A$ and $h : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $p \in B$, then $h|_B$ is continuous at $p$ ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L6] Algebra ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], claim 1, and [[thm-algebra-of-derivatives]], claims 1 and 2): sums and scalar multiples of functions continuous at a point are continuous there, and sums and scalar multiples of functions differentiable at a limit point of the common domain are differentiable there, with the corresponding derivatives.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 If $I$ has at most one element then $f$ is constant on $I$ and there is nothing to prove, the second claim following likewise. So assume $I$ has at least two elements and let $u, v \in I$ with $u < v$ be arbitrary. [given, L2]

2.1 By [L2] the segment $[u,v]$ is contained in $I$, and $u < v$, so $[u,v]$ is a nondegenerate interval. The restriction $f|_{[u,v]}$ is continuous on $[u,v]$ by [L5]. [step 1.1, L2, L5]

2.2 Let $x \in (u,v)$. By [L3] the point $x$ is interior to $I$, so $f$ is differentiable at $x$ with $f'(x) = 0$ by hypothesis. By [L4] the point $x$ is a limit point of $[u,v]$, so $f|_{[u,v]}$ is differentiable at $x$ with $(f|_{[u,v]})'(x) = f'(x) = 0$. [step 1.1, L3, L4]

3.1 By steps 2.1 and 2.2 the function $f|_{[u,v]}$ satisfies the hypotheses of [L1] on $[u,v]$, so there is $c \in (u,v)$ with $f(v) - f(u) = (f|_{[u,v]})'(c)\,(v-u) = 0 \cdot (v-u) = 0$. Hence $f(u) = f(v)$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L1]

4.1 Any two distinct points of $I$ can be named $u$ and $v$ with $u < v$, and step 3.1 then gives $f(u) = f(v)$; at a single point the equality is trivial. So $f$ takes one and the same value at every point of $I$, and $f$ is constant on $I$. [step 1.1, step 3.1]

5.1 **Second claim.** Put $h := f + (-1)g$, so $h(x) = f(x) - g(x)$ on $I$. By [L6] the function $h$ is continuous on $I$. If $I$ has at most one element the claim is trivial; otherwise every point of $I$ is a limit point of $I$ by [L4], so at every interior point $x$ of $I$ the sum rule of [L6] applies and gives that $h$ is differentiable at $x$ with $h'(x) = f'(x) - g'(x) = 0$. By step 4.1, applied to $h$ in place of $f$, the function $h$ is constant on $I$; writing $k$ for its value, $f(x) = g(x) + k$ for every $x \in I$. [step 4.1, L4, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- **What is really being used.** Only that any two points of $I$ are joined by a segment inside $I$, and that on such a segment the mean value theorem turns a vanishing derivative into a vanishing increment. Both facts are about $I$, not about $f$, which is why order-convexity is the hypothesis and not, say, openness or connectedness in some other sense.

- **The second claim is the uniqueness half of antidifferentiation.** It says that a function on an interval is determined by its derivative up to one additive constant. It says nothing about existence: that some given function *is* a derivative is a separate question, settled by different machinery, and this page does not address it.

- **A vanishing derivative at every interior point is far stronger than a vanishing derivative somewhere.** The theorem consumes the hypothesis at every point of a segment at once; a single stationary point carries no information about $f$ anywhere else, which is what [[thm-fermat-interior-extremum]] already made clear from the other side.

## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq F$.

- $u \in F$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$; $S$ is
  **bounded above** if it has an upper bound.
- $u \in F$ is a **least upper bound** (or **supremum**, $\sup S$) of $S$ if $u$
  is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le u'$ for every upper bound $u'$ of $S$.

$F$ is a **complete ordered field** (equivalently, $F$ has the
**least-upper-bound property**, or is **Dedekind complete**) if every nonempty
$S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$.

## Remarks

- A least upper bound, if it exists, is unique (two least upper bounds are each
  $\le$ the other, so equal by antisymmetry of the order).
- Applying the property to $\{-s : s \in S\}$ yields the dual **greatest lower
  bound** (infimum) property, so the two are equivalent.
- The Dedekind-cut reals have this property by construction
  ([[thm-dedekind-complete]]); the Cauchy-sequence reals acquire it via
  [[cor-cauchy-reals-lub-complete]]. This definition is the target for the
  uniqueness theorem [[thm-uniqueness-complete-ordered-field]].

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field with its order and
absolute value ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]), and
neighbourhoods are those of [[def-neighbourhood-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Then
$f$ is **continuous at $c$** when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

with $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ ranging over the **positive reals**. In the
language of neighbourhoods: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ with

$$f\bigl(A \cap N_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \;\subseteq\; N_{\varepsilon}\bigl(f(c)\bigr).$$

$f$ is **continuous on $A$** when it is continuous at every point of $A$.

**The point $c$ is required to lie in $A$, and the condition is unpunctured.**
Both differ from [[def-function-limit]], and deliberately. There the quantifier
runs over $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, which removes $x = c$; here $x = c$ is allowed,
and at $x = c$ the implication reads $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$, which is
automatic. So allowing $x = c$ costs nothing, and it is what lets the definition
be stated at every point of $A$, including the points where no limit exists.

**Three clauses, and all three are part of the definition.**

1. **At a limit point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is a limit point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]). Then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if the
   limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) \;=\; f(c)$$
   ([[def-function-limit]]). Indeed, for a given $\varepsilon > 0$ a $\delta$
   witnessing continuity witnesses the limit condition, because the limit
   condition quantifies over a subset of the points continuity quantifies over;
   and conversely a $\delta$ witnessing $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$ witnesses
   continuity, because the one point it omits, $x = c$, satisfies
   $|f(c) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ anyway.

2. **At an isolated point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is an isolated point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so that $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ for some real
   $\eta > 0$. Then **every** $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$: take
   $\delta := \eta$, so that the only $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ is $c$
   itself, and $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$.

3. **On a set.** Continuity on $A$ is continuity at each point of $A$, and
   nothing more. It is not a condition relating $f$ to points outside $A$.

Every point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$,
and never both ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so clauses 1 and 2 between them describe
continuity at every point of $A$.

**This is not the raw $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula of
[[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]].** That item records what goes
wrong when the *punctured* formula of [[def-function-limit]] is written down at
an arbitrary point of the domain: at an isolated point it is satisfied
vacuously by every real $L$ at once, so it defines nothing, and this library
therefore leaves $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ **undefined** at an isolated point.
Continuity at an isolated point is a different matter: the formula above is not
vacuous — it is a genuine condition on $f(c)$, satisfied because $f(c)$ is the
only value being compared with itself — and it names a single, well-defined
property. The limit is undefined there; the continuity is defined, and is
automatic. Clause 1 is the only place where the two notions meet, and it is
stated only where the limit exists as a notion.

**Where the distinction disappears.** If $A$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), then every $c \in A$ has some
$N_{\eta}(c) \subseteq A$, and a punctured neighbourhood is never empty
([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), so every point of $A$ is a limit point of $A$ and
clause 1 covers the whole of $A$. The same holds when $A$ is a nondegenerate
interval ([[def-interval]]). Isolated points are what force clause 2 to exist at
all, and they occur as soon as $A$ is allowed to be an arbitrary subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, as in $A = \{0\} \cup [1,2]$.

## Remarks

- **Continuity is local.** If $\eta > 0$ and $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agrees with
  $f$ on $A \cap N_{\eta}(c)$, then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if $g$
  is: any $\delta$ may be replaced by $\min\{\delta, \eta\}$, after which the
  condition only ever evaluates the two functions where they agree. So
  continuity at $c$ sees only an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of $c$, exactly
  as the limit does ([[lem-limit-is-local]]).

- **Continuity passes to subsets of the domain.** If $B \subseteq A$ and
  $c \in B$, then continuity of $f$ at $c$ gives continuity of the restriction
  $f|_B$ at $c$, with the same $\delta$: the condition on $f|_B$ quantifies over
  fewer points. The converse fails, and the standard witness is the indicator of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ restricted to $\mathbb{Q}$, which is constant and hence
  continuous, while the indicator itself is continuous nowhere
  ([[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]]).

- **The radius is a real number.** As in [[def-neighbourhood-r]], $\varepsilon$
  and $\delta$ range over the positive reals here. Restricting either quantifier
  to the positive rationals defines the same relation, by the passage recorded
  in [[def-function-limit]]: below every positive real lies a positive rational
  ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and a real $\delta$ may be shrunk to a rational
  one below it.

- **The word *continuous* is used for two things in this library, and they
  agree.** [[def-metric-continuity]] defines continuity of a map between metric
  spaces, and $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ carries the metric $d(x,y) = |x-y|$. The
  two notions coincide, and that is proved, not assumed:
  [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]] is the dictionary, and it is stated on
  this page precisely so that no later item has to guess.

## Definition

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]). Write $\mathcal{P}$ for the set of all partitions of
$[a,b]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]) and put

$$\mathcal{L} \;:=\; \{\, L(f,P) \ : \ P \in \mathcal{P} \,\}, \qquad \mathcal{U} \;:=\; \{\, U(f,P) \ : \ P \in \mathcal{P} \,\}$$

for the sets of lower and of upper Darboux sums ([[def-darboux-sums]]).

### Both extrema exist

**$\mathcal{P}$ is nonempty**: the pair $(1, t)$ with $t_0 := a$ and $t_k := b$
for $k \ge 1$ is a partition of $[a,b]$, since $a < b$. So $\mathcal{L}$ and
$\mathcal{U}$ are nonempty.

**$\mathcal{L}$ is bounded above and $\mathcal{U}$ is bounded below.** Fix any
$Q \in \mathcal{P}$. By claim 2 of [[lem-refinement-inequalities]],
$L(f,P) \le U(f,Q)$ for every $P \in \mathcal{P}$, so $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound
of $\mathcal{L}$; and $L(f,Q) \le U(f,P)$ for every $P$, so $L(f,Q)$ is a lower
bound of $\mathcal{U}$.

Hence a nonempty set bounded above has a supremum
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and a nonempty set bounded below has an infimum
([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]), each unique ([[lem-sup-unique]]).
The **lower** and **upper Darboux integrals** of $f$ over $[a,b]$ are the real
numbers

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;:=\; \sup \mathcal{L} \;=\; \sup_{P} L(f,P), \qquad \overline{\int_a^b} f \;:=\; \inf \mathcal{U} \;=\; \inf_{P} U(f,P) .$$

### The lower integral never exceeds the upper one

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f .$$

Indeed, for each fixed $Q \in \mathcal{P}$ the number $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound
of $\mathcal{L}$, so the least upper bound satisfies
$\underline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,Q)$. As $Q$ was arbitrary, $\underline{\int_a^b}f$
is a lower bound of $\mathcal{U}$, and the greatest lower bound satisfies
$\underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f$ ([[def-infimum]]).

Moreover, for **every** partition $P$,

$$L(f,P) \;\le\; \underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; U(f,P) ,$$

the outer inequalities because a member of a set is at most its supremum and at
least its infimum.

### Integrability

$f$ is **Darboux integrable on $[a,b]$**, and on this page simply
**integrable**, when

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;=\; \overline{\int_a^b} f ,$$

and then the common value is written

$$\int_a^b f \qquad \text{or} \qquad \int_a^b f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x ,$$

the **integral of $f$ over $[a,b]$**. It is a single well-determined real
number, being the common value of two numbers each of which is unique
([[lem-sup-unique]]). Without the displayed equality the symbol $\int_a^b f$ is
not defined and is never written.

**The inequality above is the whole difficulty.** By the previous paragraph
integrability is *never* a question of one integral exceeding the other, only of
the gap $\overline{\int_a^b} f - \underline{\int_a^b} f \ge 0$ being $0$; and by
[[thm-riemann-criterion]] that gap is $0$ exactly when a single partition can be
found making $U(f,P) - L(f,P)$ small. Whether that is possible is settled
completely, in terms of the discontinuities of $f$, by
[[thm-lebesgue-criterion]].

**"Riemann integrable" means the same thing here.** The definition above is
Darboux's. Riemann's own definition, in terms of tagged partitions of small
mesh, is [[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]], and the two define the same
class of functions with the same integral by [[thm-darboux-equals-riemann]].
Until that theorem is proved the two phrases are kept apart; after it they are
used interchangeably, as they are throughout the literature.

## Remarks

- **The supremum is over all partitions, and nothing is selected.** Both
  $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{U}$ are sets determined by $f$ and $[a,b]$ alone,
  and $\sup$ and $\inf$ are canonical, so no choice principle is involved in
  forming either integral. Where a choice does enter on this page is recorded in
  [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].

- **Why the lower integral is a supremum and not an infimum.** Refining a
  partition can only increase a lower sum and decrease an upper sum
  ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]]), so the lower sums push up towards the
  integral and the upper sums push down towards it. Taking $\inf \mathcal{L}$
  would return the sum over the coarsest partition and would carry no
  information about $f$ beyond its infimum on $[a,b]$.

- **A bounded $f$ always has both integrals; only their equality can fail.** The
  Dirichlet function on $[0,1]$ has lower integral $0$ and upper integral $1$
  ([[fs-bounded-implies-riemann-integrable]]), which is the standard witness that
  the definition above is not vacuous in either direction.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), neighbourhoods are those of
[[def-neighbourhood-r]] and limit points those of [[def-limit-point-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$ be a
**limit point of $A$**. The **difference quotient of $f$ at $c$** is the function

$$q_{f,c} : A \setminus \{c\} \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad q_{f,c}(x) := \frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c} .$$

The division is legitimate at every point of the domain, since $x \ne c$ gives
$x - c \ne 0$.

**The point $c$ is a limit point of $A \setminus \{c\}$, not merely of $A$.**
For every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the punctured neighbourhood
$N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c)$ omits $c$, so

$$N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c) \cap A \;=\; N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c) \cap (A \setminus \{c\}) ,$$

and the left-hand side is nonempty because $c$ is a limit point of $A$. So
$q_{f,c}$ is a function on a set having $c$ as a limit point, and
$\lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x)$ is a notion that [[def-function-limit]] defines.

$f$ is **differentiable at $c$** when that limit exists, and then the
**derivative of $f$ at $c$** is

$$f'(c) \;:=\; \lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x) \;=\; \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c} .$$

**Two obligations are carried by that notation, and both are discharged here.**

1. **Uniqueness.** Writing $f'(c)$ treats the right-hand side as a name for a
   single real number. That is legitimate: $c$ is a limit point of the domain
   $A \setminus \{c\}$ of $q_{f,c}$, so at most one real can satisfy the
   $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ condition, by [[lem-function-limit-unique]] applied to
   $q_{f,c}$. Two reals both meeting the condition are therefore equal, and the
   symbol denotes.
2. **Meaningfulness.** The hypothesis that $c$ is a limit point of $A$ is not
   decoration. At an **isolated** point of $A$ the punctured condition
   $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ is met by no point of the domain at all, so the
   $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula is satisfied vacuously by *every* real at
   once; this is why [[def-function-limit]] leaves the limit undefined there,
   and it is why this library defines $f'(c)$ only at a limit point of $A$. At
   an isolated point of its domain a function is neither differentiable nor
   non-differentiable here: the question is not posed.

**The limit sees only $A \setminus \{c\}$, so how the difference quotient is
extended to $c$ is irrelevant.** Let $Q : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agree with
$q_{f,c}$ at every point of $A \setminus \{c\}$, and let $L \in \mathbb{R}$.
Then $\lim_{x \to c} Q(x) = L$ if and only if $\lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x) = L$.
Both conditions read: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ such that every point $x$ of the relevant domain with
$0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|{\cdot} - L| < \varepsilon$
([[def-function-limit]]). The clause $0 < |x - c|$ removes $x = c$ from both
quantifiers, so in both cases the points quantified over are exactly the
$x \in A \setminus \{c\}$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, at which $Q$ and
$q_{f,c}$ take the same value. The two conditions are the same condition.

**Differentiability on a set.** For $S \subseteq A$, $f$ is **differentiable on
$S$** when it is differentiable at every $c \in S$; implicit in that phrase is
that every point of $S$ is a limit point of $A$. $f$ is **differentiable** when
it is differentiable on the whole of $A$.

**Restriction of the domain.** Let $B \subseteq A$, let $c \in B$ and suppose
$c$ is a limit point of $B$. If $f$ is differentiable at $c$, then so is the
restriction $f|_B : B \to \mathbb{R}$, and

$$(f|_B)'(c) \;=\; f'(c) .$$

Indeed $B \setminus \{c\} \subseteq A \setminus \{c\}$; the displayed identity
of punctured neighbourhoods above, applied to $B$, shows that $c$ is a limit
point of $B \setminus \{c\}$; the difference quotient $q_{f|_B, c}$ is the
restriction of $q_{f,c}$ to $B \setminus \{c\}$, since $f|_B(c) = f(c)$; and
claim 2 of [[lem-limit-is-local]] carries the limit to that restriction.

**Every point of a nondegenerate interval is a limit point of it.** Let
$J \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be order-convex ([[def-interval]]) with at least two
elements and let $p \in J$. Choose $q \in J$ with $q \ne p$, and let a real
$\varepsilon > 0$ be given. If $p < q$, put $y := p + \tfrac{1}{2}\min\{\varepsilon,\ q - p\}$;
then $p < y$, and $y - p \le \tfrac{1}{2}(q-p) < q - p$, so $p < y < q$ and
order-convexity gives $y \in J$, while $0 < |y - p| < \varepsilon$. If $q < p$,
the point $y := p - \tfrac{1}{2}\min\{\varepsilon,\ p - q\}$ serves in the same
way. So $N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(p) \cap J \ne \varnothing$ for every real
$\varepsilon > 0$, that is, $p$ is a limit point of $J$
([[def-limit-point-r]]).

Consequently, for $f$ defined on a nondegenerate interval $I$, the symbol
$f'(c)$ is meaningful at **every** $c \in I$, endpoints included. At an endpoint
the difference quotient is taken over the points of $I$ lying on the one side
that is available, so what other texts call a one-sided derivative is, here,
simply the derivative of $f$ on $I$.

## Remarks

- **Notation.** $f'(c)$ and $\frac{df}{dx}(c)$ denote the same real number, and
  this library uses the first. Neither is an operation performed on a symbol
  $x$: the variable in the second is a name for the argument and nothing more.

- **Differentiability is a property of the pair $(f, A)$ at $c$, not of $f$
  alone.** The restriction clause above goes in one direction only, and the
  converse fails. Take $A := \mathbb{R}$, $f(x) := |x|$, $B := [0,\infty)$ and
  $c := 0$. Then $f|_B$ is the identity on $B$, whose difference quotient at $0$
  is constantly $1$, so $f|_B$ is differentiable at $0$ with derivative $1$;
  that $f$ itself is not differentiable at $0$ is
  [[cex-absolute-value-is-not-differentiable-at-zero]] on the companion page.
  So enlarging the domain can destroy differentiability, and the phrase
  "$f$ is differentiable at $c$" always carries the domain with it.

- **The relation to continuity is not definitional.** [[def-continuity-real]]
  is a condition on $f$ near $c$ that does not mention a quotient, and it is
  defined at every point of $A$, isolated points included, whereas
  differentiability is defined only at limit points of $A$. That
  differentiability implies continuity is a theorem on this page and not a
  reading of the definitions.

- **No second derivative and no one-sided derivative is introduced here.**
  Both are standard, and both are absent from this page on purpose;
  [[rem-derivative-conventions]] records exactly what is fixed and what is left
  open at this point in the reading order.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) with its order and absolute value
([[def-real-order]]).

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$, let $c \in \mathbb{R}$
be a **limit point** of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and let $L \in \mathbb{R}$.
We say that **$f(x)$ tends to $L$ as $x$ tends to $c$**, and write

$$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L ,$$

when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ 0 < |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - L| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

where $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ range over the **positive reals**.

In the language of neighbourhoods ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]) the condition reads:
for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ with

$$f\bigl(A \cap N^{*}_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \;\subseteq\; N_{\varepsilon}(L),$$

$N^{*}_{\delta}(c) = \{\, y : 0 < |y - c| < \delta \,\}$ being the punctured
$\delta$-neighbourhood of $c$ and $N_{\varepsilon}(L) = (L - \varepsilon,\ L +
\varepsilon)$ the open interval of [[def-interval]]. The two forms agree because
$|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ says exactly $f(x) \in N_\varepsilon(L)$, and
$0 < |x - c| < \delta$ says exactly $x \in N^{*}_\delta(c)$.

**Three features of this definition are load bearing, not decoration.**

1. **$c$ is required to be a limit point of $A$.** By [[def-limit-point-r]] that
   says every punctured neighbourhood of $c$ meets $A$, so for every $\delta > 0$
   the set $A \cap N^{*}_\delta(c)$ over which the implication quantifies is
   nonempty. Drop the requirement and the implication can be satisfied
   vacuously by *every* real $L$ at once, which is exactly what
   [[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]] records. At a point of $A$
   that is not a limit point of $A$ — an isolated point — the symbol
   $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ is therefore **not defined** in this library.

2. **$c \in A$ is not required.** A limit point of $A$ need not belong to $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and the definition never evaluates $f$ at $c$. This
   is what allows a limit to be taken at a point where the function is not
   defined at all, as at $0$ for $x \mapsto x\,\psi(1/x)$.

3. **The value $f(c)$, when it exists, is irrelevant.** The hypothesis
   $0 < |x - c|$ excludes $x = c$ from the quantifier, so changing $f$ at the
   single point $c$ changes nothing. Equality of the limit with the value is an
   extra condition, not a consequence: [[fs-limit-equals-value]].

**The notation presumes uniqueness.** Writing $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$ treats
the left-hand side as a name for a single real number, which is legitimate only
because at a limit point at most one $L$ can satisfy the displayed condition.
That obligation is discharged by [[lem-function-limit-unique]], recorded in this
item's `justified_by`. As with $\sup S$ ([[rem-sup-conventions]]) and
$\lim_k x_k$ ([[lem-limit-unique]]), the symbol is written only for a function
already known to have a limit at $c$.

**Real and rational $\varepsilon$ define the same relation.** Above,
$\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ range over the positive reals. Restricting either
quantifier to the positive rationals gives the same relation: every positive
rational is a positive real, and below every positive real lies a positive
rational ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), so an $\varepsilon$-condition verified for
all positive rationals is verified for an arbitrary positive real $\eta$ by
running it at a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, and a
$\delta$ produced as a real may be shrunk to a rational one below it. This is
the passage sanctioned in the remarks of [[def-sequence]], and it is what lets
this definition be compared with [[def-real-limit]], whose $\varepsilon$ is
rational, in [[thm-sequential-criterion-for-function-limits]].

## Remarks

- **Terminology.** *Limit point* here is a property of the set $A$ and the point
  $c$, in the sense of [[def-limit-point-r]]; it has nothing to do with
  subsequential limits ([[def-subsequential-limit]]), and the distinction is the
  one that item records.

- **Why the punctured condition, and not $|x - c| < \delta$.** With the
  unpunctured condition the definition would force $f$ to be defined at $c$ and
  would force $|f(c) - L| < \varepsilon$ for every $\varepsilon$, that is,
  $L = f(c)$. The resulting notion is continuity at $c$, a strictly stronger
  condition, and conflating the two is the error catalogued in
  [[fs-limit-equals-value]].

- **One-sided and infinite variants.** Restricting the domain to one side of $c$
  gives the one-sided limits of [[def-one-sided-limits]]; replacing the
  conditions on $x$ or on $f(x)$ by unboundedness conditions gives the limits at
  and to infinity of [[def-limits-at-infinity]]. Both are built on this
  definition rather than beside it.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $m \in \mathbb{R}$.

- $m$ is a **maximum** (or *greatest element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $s \le m$
  for every $s \in S$.
- $m$ is a **minimum** (or *least element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $m \le s$
  for every $s \in S$.

A set has at most one maximum: if $m_1$ and $m_2$ are both maxima then
$m_1 \in S$ gives $m_1 \le m_2$ and $m_2 \in S$ gives $m_2 \le m_1$, so
$m_1 = m_2$ by antisymmetry of the order, which is immediate from the trichotomy
axiom of an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).
The same argument applies to minima, so we may write $\max S$ and $\min S$.

## Remarks

- A maximum is precisely an upper bound of $S$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]])
  that happens to lie in $S$; a minimum is a lower bound of $S$
  ([[def-bounded-set]]) that lies in $S$. In particular a set with a maximum is
  bounded above and a set with a minimum is bounded below.
- The empty set has neither a maximum nor a minimum, because the requirement
  $m \in S$ cannot be met.
- The membership requirement $m \in S$ is exactly what separates a maximum from a
  supremum, and it is the theme of this page. A supremum is a bound on the set
  and is not asked to belong to it; a maximum is an element of the set. The two
  agree exactly when the supremum happens to be attained ([[lem-max-is-sup]]),
  and they genuinely differ in general ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has both a maximum and a minimum
  ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]), which is what licenses the notation
  $\max\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$. Infinite sets need not: the failure of attainment is
  an infinitary phenomenon.

## Definition

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ ([[def-field]]) together with a subset
$P \subseteq F$, the set of **positive** elements (the *positive cone*),
satisfying:

- **(O1) Trichotomy.** For each $x \in F$, exactly one of the following holds:
  $x \in P$, or $x = 0$, or $-x \in P$.
- **(O2) Closure.** If $x, y \in P$ then $x + y \in P$ and $x \cdot y \in P$.

We write $x > 0$ for $x \in P$ (read "$x$ is positive"), and define the order by

$$a < b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; b - a \in P, \qquad a \le b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; a < b \text{ or } a = b.$$

Thus $a > b$ means $b < a$, and $a \ge b$ means $b \le a$. An element $x$ with
$-x \in P$ (equivalently $x < 0$) is called **negative**.

## Remarks

- By trichotomy applied to $b - a$, for any $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$,
  $a = b$, $a > b$ holds; this makes $\le$ a total order.
- (O2) says the positives are closed under addition and multiplication: sums and
  products of positives are positive.
- The rationals ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and both constructions of the reals
  ([[thm-reals-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-dedekind-ordered-field]]) are ordered
  fields, so every fact proved here from (O1)-(O2) holds in each of them.

## Definition

**Why this item is first.** The published definition of the integral does not
cover this page. [[def-darboux-integral]] is stated for reals $a < b$, because
the partitions it quantifies over are those of [[def-partition-and-refinement]],
whose standing hypothesis is $a < b$: with $a = b$ the chain
$a = t_0 < \dots < t_n = b$ is unsatisfiable. So $\int_a^b f$ is an undefined
symbol whenever $a \ge b$, and every additivity statement below would be
ill-formed as it is usually written. This item extends the notation, and nothing
else: the object it names is still the Darboux integral of
[[def-darboux-integral]].

Let $u, v \in \mathbb{R}$ and write

$$[u \wedge v,\ u \vee v] \;:=\; \text{the closed interval with endpoints } u \text{ and } v$$

([[def-interval]]). Let $f$ be a real-valued function whose domain contains that
interval. Say that **$f$ is integrable between $u$ and $v$** when either $u = v$,
or $u \ne v$ and the restriction of $f$ to $[u \wedge v,\ u \vee v]$ is bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]) and Darboux integrable there ([[def-darboux-integral]],
[[def-darboux-sums]]). For such $f$ define

$$\int_u^v f \;:=\; \begin{cases} \text{the Darboux integral of } f \text{ over } [u,v] & \text{if } u < v, \\[2pt] 0 & \text{if } u = v, \\[2pt] -\displaystyle\int_v^u f & \text{if } u > v. \end{cases}$$

**There is nothing to check for consistency.** The three clauses are indexed by
the three cases of trichotomy, $u < v$, $u = v$ and $u > v$, which are mutually
exclusive and exhaustive; no pair of them ever applies to the same $(u,v)$. In
particular the first clause is untouched, so on $u < v$ this is the published
integral verbatim and every published theorem about it applies unchanged.

**The middle clause is a stipulation, not a computation.** It is *not* claimed
that $0$ is a value forced by the $u < v$ definition in any limiting sense; that
definition simply says nothing at $u = v$, and $\int_u^u f := 0$ is what is
written there. It is also unconditional: no hypothesis on $f$ beyond being
defined at $u$ is asked for, since the case $u = v$ never refers to a partition.

### The two consequences used throughout the page

**Antisymmetry, for every pair.** For all reals $u, v$ with $f$ integrable
between them,

$$\int_u^v f \;=\; -\int_v^u f .$$

Indeed if $u < v$ then $v > u$ and the third clause reads
$\int_v^u f = -\int_u^v f$, which rearranges to the display; if $u = v$ both
sides are $0$; and if $u > v$ the third clause is the display itself.

**Absolute values agree.** Consequently
$\bigl|\int_u^v f\bigr| = \bigl|\int_v^u f\bigr|$ for every such pair.

**An obligation recorded here and discharged elsewhere.** With this convention
the additivity identity

$$\int_u^v f \;+\; \int_v^w f \;=\; \int_u^w f$$

holds for **every** arrangement of $u, v, w$ in an interval on which $f$ is
integrable, not only for $u < v < w$. That is a theorem and not part of this
definition; it is proved as the last clause of
[[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]], and nothing on this page uses it before it
is proved there.

## Remarks

- **This is notation, and it is a real notation.** Without it the substitution
  theorem could not be stated with the limits $\varphi(c)$ and $\varphi(d)$ in
  the order the map produces them, since a differentiable $\varphi$ need be
  neither injective nor monotone; and the integral function $x \mapsto \int_a^x f$
  would be undefined at $x = a$.

- **One published inequality is not orientation-invariant, and that is a trap.**
  The estimate $\bigl|\int_u^v f\bigr| \le \int_u^v |f|$ is guaranteed only
  for $u \le v$: at $u > v$ the right-hand side is $-\int_v^u |f| \le 0$ while
  the left-hand side is $\ge 0$, so the inequality fails whenever
  $\int_v^u |f| > 0$. The form valid for every pair is
  $\bigl|\int_u^v f\bigr| \le \bigl|\int_u^v |f|\bigr|$, and this is stated where
  it is proved ([[cor-integrability-of-absolute-values-products-and-lattice-operations]]).

- **Integrability is a property of the unordered pair.** By construction, $f$ is
  integrable between $u$ and $v$ if and only if it is integrable between $v$ and
  $u$, since both refer to the same closed interval; only the sign of the value
  remembers the order.

## Definition

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]). The **integral function of $f$ with base point $a$**
is

$$F : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad F(x) \;:=\; \int_a^x f .$$

**It is a genuine function, and that has to be checked.** For $x \in (a,b]$ the
restriction of $f$ to $[a,x]$ is integrable, by
[[lem-integrability-on-a-subinterval]] applied with $c := a$ and $d := x$, so
$\int_a^x f$ names a single real number ([[def-darboux-integral]]). For $x = a$
the symbol $\int_a^a f$ is $0$ by [[def-oriented-integral]]. So $F(x)$ is defined
at every point of $[a,b]$ and

$$F(a) \;=\; 0 .$$

More generally, for any base point $c \in [a,b]$ the function
$x \mapsto \int_c^x f$ is defined on the whole of $[a,b]$, the integral being the
oriented one of [[def-oriented-integral]] when $x < c$; the case $c = a$ is
written $F$ above and is the one used unless another base point is named.

### The two identities used throughout

**Increments are integrals.** For all $x, y \in [a,b]$, in either order,

$$F(y) - F(x) \;=\; \int_x^y f .$$

This is claim 3 of [[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]] applied to the three
points $a$, $x$, $y$: it gives $\int_a^x f + \int_x^y f = \int_a^y f$, that is
$F(x) + \int_x^y f = F(y)$. No ordering of $x$ and $y$ is assumed, and the
degenerate cases $x = y$, $x = a$ and $y = a$ are included, since claim 3 is
stated for arbitrary points.

**Changing the base point changes $F$ by a constant.** If $c \in [a,b]$ and
$F_c(x) := \int_c^x f$, then for every $x \in [a,b]$

$$F_c(x) \;=\; F(x) - F(c) ,$$

again by claim 3 of [[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]] at the points $a$, $c$,
$x$. So the family of integral functions of $f$ is one function up to an
additive constant.

## Remarks

- **$F$ exists for every integrable $f$, whether or not $f$ has a primitive.**
  Nothing in the definition asks $f$ to be continuous anywhere, and nothing here
  claims $F' = f$. The two statements about $F'$ that this page does prove are: $F$ is
  always Lipschitz ([[thm-the-integral-function-is-lipschitz]]), and $F'(c) = f(c)$
  at every point $c$ where $f$ is continuous ([[thm-ftc-first-part]]).

- **$F$ need not be a primitive of $f$.** At a discontinuity of $f$ the
  derivative $F'$ may fail to exist, or may exist and differ from $f$; both
  possibilities are exhibited on the companion page, by
  [[cex-an-integrable-function-with-no-primitive]] and
  [[fs-the-integral-function-is-always-a-primitive]]. That is the honest content
  of the phrase "the integral function", and it is why it is not called "the

- **Why the base point is part of the data and the notation suppresses it.** The
  symbol $F$ hides its dependence on $a$, as is customary; the identity
  $F_c = F - F(c)$ above is what makes the suppression harmless, since every
  statement below about $F$ is about its increments, which do not see the base

## Statement

Let $a < c < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]). Then:

1. $f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ ([[def-darboux-integral]]) **if and only if** its
   restrictions to $[a,c]$ and to $[c,b]$ are integrable;
2. and in that case
   $$\int_a^b f \;=\; \int_a^c f \;+\; \int_c^b f .$$
3. **Oriented form.** Let $\alpha < \beta$ be reals, let $f : [\alpha,\beta] \to
   \mathbb{R}$ be integrable, and let $u, v, w \in [\alpha,\beta]$ be arbitrary.
   Then, with the convention of [[def-oriented-integral]],
   $$\int_u^v f \;+\; \int_v^w f \;=\; \int_u^w f .$$

Claim 3 is where [[def-oriented-integral]] earns its place: it holds for every
arrangement of the three points, including the degenerate ones, and it is the
form used everywhere below.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < c < b$ and a bounded $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$; and, for claim 3, reals $\alpha < \beta$, an integrable $f : [\alpha,\beta] \to \mathbb{R}$ and points $u,v,w \in [\alpha,\beta]$. Let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given.

[L1] Riemann's criterion on any closed bounded interval with distinct endpoints ([[thm-riemann-criterion]]).

[L2] A function integrable on $[p,q]$ is integrable on every $[p',q'] \subseteq [p,q]$ with $p' < q'$ ([[lem-integrability-on-a-subinterval]]).

[L3] For a partition $R = (n,t)$ and bounded $h$: $L(h,R) = \sum_{i<n}m_i\Delta_i$, $U(h,R) = \sum_{i<n}M_i\Delta_i$, and $L(h,R) \le \underline{\int} h \le \overline{\int} h \le U(h,R)$, the integral being the common value of the two when they agree ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L4] A partition of $[p,q]$ is a pair $(n,t)$ with $n \ge 1$, $t_0 = p$, $t_i < t_{i+1}$ for $i < n$ and $t_k = q$ for $k \ge n$; its subintervals are $[t_i,t_{i+1}]$ for $i<n$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-interval]]).

[L5] Finite sums split at an intermediate index, with $\sum_{k=p}^{q-1}x_k = \sum_{j<q-p}x_{p+j}$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], clause 3).

[L6] With oriented limits, $\int_v^u h = -\int_u^v h$ and $\int_u^u h = 0$ ([[def-oriented-integral]]).

[L7] Ordered-field arithmetic: adding a constant preserves an inequality, the order is total and transitive, and a real of absolute value below every positive real is $0$ ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Claim 1, forward.** If $f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ then, since $a < c$ and $c < b$, [L2] gives integrability on $[a,c]$ and on $[c,b]$. [L2]

1.2 **The splice.** Let $P_1 = (n_1,t^1)$ be a partition of $[a,c]$ and $P_2 = (n_2,t^2)$ one of $[c,b]$. Define $P := (n_1+n_2,\ t)$ by $t_i := t^1_i$ for $i \le n_1$, $t_{n_1+j} := t^2_j$ for $j \le n_2$, and $t_k := b$ for $k \ge n_1+n_2$. The two prescriptions agree at $i = n_1$, where $t^1_{n_1} = c = t^2_0$; and $t_0 = a$, $t_{n_1+n_2} = t^2_{n_2} = b$, with $t_i < t_{i+1}$ for every $i < n_1+n_2$. So $P$ is a partition of $[a,b]$. [L4, construct]

1.3 **Claim 1, converse.** Suppose $f$ is integrable on $[a,c]$ and on $[c,b]$, and use [L1] on each to fix $P_1$ with $U(f,P_1)-L(f,P_1) < \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1}$ and $P_2$ with $U(f,P_2)-L(f,P_2) < \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1}$. [L1, choose]

2.1 The first $n_1$ subintervals of $P$ are those of $P_1$ and the last $n_2$ are those of $P_2$, with the matching lengths, so by [L3] and the splitting law [L5], $L(f,P) = L(f,P_1) + L(f,P_2)$ and $U(f,P) = U(f,P_1) + U(f,P_2)$. [step 1.2, L3, L4, L5]

3.1 For the splice $P$ of those two, step 2.1 gives $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$; as $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary and $f$ is bounded, [L1] makes $f$ integrable on $[a,b]$. [step 1.2, step 2.1, step 1.3, L1, L7]

4.1 **Claim 2.** With $P_1$, $P_2$ and $P$ as above, [L3] puts $\int_a^b f$ between $L(f,P)$ and $U(f,P)$, that is between $L(f,P_1)+L(f,P_2)$ and $U(f,P_1)+U(f,P_2)$ by step 2.1; and [L3] applied on $[a,c]$ and on $[c,b]$ puts $\int_a^c f + \int_c^b f$ between the same two numbers. [step 2.1, step 1.3, step 3.1, L3]

5.1 Those two numbers differ by less than $\varepsilon$ by step 1.3, so $\bigl|\int_a^b f - \int_a^c f - \int_c^b f\bigr| < \varepsilon$; as $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary the difference is $0$, which is claim 2. [step 1.3, step 4.1, L7]

6.1 **Claim 3, first the sorted case.** Let $x \le y$ in $[\alpha,\beta]$. Then $\int_\alpha^y f = \int_\alpha^x f + \int_x^y f$. Indeed if $\alpha < x < y$ this is claim 2 applied on $[\alpha,y]$, where $f$ is integrable by [L2]; if $x = \alpha$ the middle term is $0$ by [L6] and the identity is trivial; and if $x = y$ the last term is $0$ by [L6] and the identity is again trivial. [step 5.1, L2, L6]

7.1 Put $F(x) := \int_\alpha^x f$ for $x \in [\alpha,\beta]$, which is defined by [L2] and [L6]. Then $\int_x^y f = F(y) - F(x)$ for **all** $x,y \in [\alpha,\beta]$: for $x < y$ this is step 6.1 rearranged; for $x = y$ both sides are $0$ by [L6]; and for $x > y$ the case already proved gives $\int_y^x f = F(x)-F(y)$, and [L6] negates both sides. [step 6.1, L2, L6, construct]

8.1 **Claim 3.** For arbitrary $u,v,w \in [\alpha,\beta]$, step 7.1 gives $\int_u^v f + \int_v^w f = \bigl(F(v)-F(u)\bigr) + \bigl(F(w)-F(v)\bigr) = F(w)-F(u) = \int_u^w f$. [step 7.1, algebra] ∎

## Remarks

- **The oriented form is not proved by listing six orderings.** Step 7.1 shows that the oriented integral between two points is a *difference of values of one function of one variable*, after which claim 3 is the cancellation $(F(v)-F(u))+(F(w)-F(v)) = F(w)-F(u)$, valid however the three points are arranged and however many of them coincide. The case analysis is confined to the two lines of step 7.1, and no appeal to symmetry is made anywhere.

- **The function $F$ of step 7.1 is the integral function**, and it is given its own item, [[def-the-integral-function]], because the rest of the page is about it. Nothing there re-proves step 7.1; it cites this theorem.

- **Boundedness on the whole of $[a,b]$ is a hypothesis of claim 1 in both directions.** Boundedness on $[a,c]$ and on $[c,b]$ separately does give boundedness on the union, so the converse could be stated with the hypothesis split; it is stated globally because [[def-darboux-sums]] needs it globally to make $U(f,P)$ meaningful for a partition of $[a,b]$.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $[a,b]$
([[def-continuity-real]]). Then $f$ is bounded ([[def-bounded-set]]) and Riemann
integrable on $[a,b]$ ([[def-darboux-integral]]).

**The proof gives more than integrability: it gives a partition that works.** For
every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the uniform partition into $N$ parts already
satisfies $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$, as soon as $N$ is large enough that
$(b-a)/\iota(N)$ is below the $\delta$ that uniform continuity supplies for
$\varepsilon/\bigl(2(b-a)\bigr)$. Uniform continuity is exactly what makes one
$\delta$ serve all $N$ subintervals at once, and it is the only place where the
compactness of $[a,b]$ is used.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and a function $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ continuous on $[a,b]$.

[L1] $[a,b]$ is closed and bounded, hence compact ([[def-interval]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-bounded-set]], [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L2] A continuous real function on a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is bounded there ([[cor-boundedness-theorem-r]]).

[L3] Heine-Cantor: a continuous real function on a compact subset $K$ of $\mathbb{R}$ is uniformly continuous on $K$, that is, for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ with $|f(x) - f(y)| < \eta$ for all $x, y \in K$ with $|x - y| < \delta$ ([[thm-heine-cantor-r]], [[def-uniform-continuity-real]]).

[L4] For a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[a,b]$: $\Delta_i = t_{i+1} - t_i > 0$, $\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = b-a$, and the uniform partition $U_N$ into $N \ge 1$ parts has every $\Delta_i$ equal to $(b-a)/\iota(N)$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L5] $U(f,P) - L(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}(M_i - m_i)\Delta_i$ and $M_i - m_i = \sup\{|f(x)-f(y)| : x, y \in I_i\}$ for bounded $f$ ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L6] Riemann's criterion: a bounded $f$ is integrable if and only if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a partition $P$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$ ([[thm-riemann-criterion]]).

[L7] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N) < \eta$, and $\iota(N) > 0$ for $N \ge 1$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L8] Finite sums: scaling and monotonicity in the terms ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L9] Ordered-field arithmetic and the absolute value: adding a constant and multiplying by a positive quantity preserve an inequality; the order is total and transitive; $x, y \in [c,d]$ gives $|x - y| \le d - c$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-interval]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $[a,b]$ is compact by [L1], so $f$ is bounded on $[a,b]$ by [L2] and its Darboux sums and integrals are defined. [given, L1, L2]

1.2 Let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given and put $\eta := \varepsilon \cdot \bigl(2(b-a)\bigr)^{-1}$, a positive real by [L9] since $b - a > 0$. [given, L9]

2.1 By [L3] applied to the compact set $[a,b]$ with this $\eta$, fix a real $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(x) - f(y)| < \eta$ for all $x, y \in [a,b]$ with $|x - y| < \delta$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1, L3, choose]

3.1 By [L7] fix a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N) < \delta \cdot (b-a)^{-1}$, and put $P := U_N = (N,t)$, the uniform partition of $[a,b]$ into $N$ parts. Then every $\Delta_i$ equals $(b-a)/\iota(N) < \delta$ by [L4] and [L9]. [step 2.1, L4, L7, L9, choose]

4.1 For each $i < N$ and all $x, y \in I_i = [t_i, t_{i+1}]$ one has $|x-y| \le \Delta_i < \delta$ by [L9], hence $|f(x) - f(y)| < \eta$ by step 2.1. So $\eta$ is an upper bound of the set $\{|f(x)-f(y)| : x,y \in I_i\}$, and therefore $M_i - m_i \le \eta$ by [L5]. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L5, L9]

5.1 Consequently $U(f,P) - L(f,P) = \sum_{i<N}(M_i - m_i)\Delta_i \le \sum_{i<N}\eta\,\Delta_i = \eta\,(b-a) = \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} < \varepsilon$, using [L5], step 4.1, $\Delta_i > 0$, [L8], [L4] and [L9]. [step 4.1, L4, L5, L8, L9]

6.1 Since the real $\varepsilon > 0$ of step 1.2 was arbitrary and step 5.1 produced a partition with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$, criterion [L6] applies and $f$ is Riemann integrable on $[a,b]$; it is bounded by step 1.1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 5.1, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- **Continuity is sufficient and very far from necessary.** A monotone function may have infinitely many discontinuities and is still integrable ([[thm-monotone-implies-integrable]]); Thomae's function is discontinuous at every rational and integrable ([[cor-countably-many-discontinuities-integrable]]); and the indicator of the Cantor set is discontinuous at uncountably many points and integrable. The exact frontier is [[thm-lebesgue-criterion]].

- **Where compactness enters, and what it buys.** Only through [L1], and then twice: [[cor-boundedness-theorem-r]] to know that the Darboux sums exist at all, and [[thm-heine-cantor-r]] to get one $\delta$ for the whole interval. On a non-compact interval both can fail: $x \mapsto 1/x$ is continuous on $(0,1)$ and unbounded there, so it has no Darboux sums at all.

- **The choice cost is inherited, not incurred.** Nothing in the proof above selects anything from an infinite family; the single use of countable choice behind this theorem sits inside [[thm-heine-cantor-r]], which names it in its own statement. See [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]), let $F$ be its integral function
([[def-the-integral-function]]), and let $c \in [a,b]$ be a point at which $f$ is
continuous ([[def-continuity-real]]). Then $F$ is differentiable at $c$ as a
function on $[a,b]$ ([[def-derivative]]) and

$$F'(c) \;=\; f(c) .$$

At $c = a$ and $c = b$ this is the one-sided statement, which is what
[[def-derivative]] means at those points: every point of a nondegenerate interval
is a limit point of it, so $F'(c)$ is a meaningful symbol at every $c \in [a,b]$,
and the difference quotient is taken over $[a,b] \setminus \{c\}$.

**Consequently, if $f$ is continuous on the whole of $[a,b]$, then $F$ is a
primitive of $f$ there**: $F' = f$ at every point of $[a,b]$.

**Continuity at $c$ is a hypothesis and it cannot be dropped.** For an integrable
$f$ that is discontinuous at $c$, $F'(c)$ may fail to exist, and it may exist and
differ from $f(c)$; both are exhibited on the companion page, by
an integrable function with no primitive and by a false
statement about the integral function.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, an integrable $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, its integral function $F(x) = \int_a^x f$, a point $c \in [a,b]$ at which $f$ is continuous, and a real $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] $F(x) - F(c) = \int_c^x f$ for all $x, c \in [a,b]$, in either order ([[def-the-integral-function]], [[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]]).

[L2] Continuity at $c$: for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $t \in [a,b]$ with $|t - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|f(t) - f(c)| < \eta$ ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L3] Every point of a nondegenerate interval is a limit point of it, so $F'(c) = \lim_{x\to c} \bigl(F(x)-F(c)\bigr)/(x-c)$ is a meaningful symbol, the limit being taken over $[a,b]\setminus\{c\}$ ([[def-derivative]], [[def-function-limit]], [[def-interval]]).

[L4] For $p < q$ in $[a,b]$: $f$ and $|f|$ and every constant are integrable on $[p,q]$; $\int_p^q \lambda = \lambda(q-p)$; sums and scalar multiples of integrable functions are integrable with the corresponding identity; and $\bigl|\int_p^q u\bigr| \le \int_p^q |u|$ ([[lem-integrability-on-a-subinterval]], [[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]], [[thm-linearity-of-the-integral]], [[cor-integrability-of-absolute-values-products-and-lattice-operations]]).

[L5] If $u \le w$ pointwise on $[p,q]$ and both are integrable then $\int_p^q u \le \int_p^q w$ ([[thm-monotonicity-of-the-integral]]).

[L6] With oriented limits, $\int_q^p u = -\int_p^q u$ and $\int_p^p u = 0$ ([[def-oriented-integral]]).

[L7] Absolute value and ordered-field arithmetic: $|{-t}| = |t|$, $|t\,s| = |t||s|$, $|t| \le c$ follows from $-c \le t \le c$, a positive real has a positive inverse, and the order is total and transitive ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). The nonstrict forms of the order facts follow from the strict ones by adjoining equality.

[L8] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a real $\eta' > 0$ with $\eta' < \eta$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L2] with $\eta := \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$, fix a real $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(t)-f(c)| < \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1}$ for every $t \in [a,b]$ with $|t-c| < \delta$. [given, L2, L7, L8, choose]

1.2 For $x \in [a,b]$ with $x \ne c$, [L1] and [L4] give $F(x) - F(c) - f(c)(x-c) = \int_c^x f - \int_c^x f(c) = \int_c^x \bigl(f(t) - f(c)\bigr)\,\mathrm{d}t$, the constant $f(c)$ having integral $f(c)(x-c)$ over the oriented interval from $c$ to $x$ by [L4] and [L6]. [L1, L4, L6]

2.1 **The estimate for $c < x < c+\delta$.** Every $t \in [c,x]$ has $|t-c| < \delta$, so $-\varepsilon\cdot2^{-1} \le f(t)-f(c) \le \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1}$ there by step 1.1, whence $\bigl|\int_c^x (f - f(c))\bigr| \le \varepsilon\cdot2^{-1}\,(x-c)$ by [L4] and [L5]. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L4, L5, L7]

2.2 **The estimate for $c-\delta < x < c$.** By [L6], $\int_c^x (f-f(c)) = -\int_x^c (f-f(c))$, and every $t \in [x,c]$ has $|t-c| < \delta$, so the same argument gives $\bigl|\int_c^x (f-f(c))\bigr| \le \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1}\,(c-x)$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L4, L5, L6, L7]

3.1 In both cases $\bigl|\int_c^x(f-f(c))\bigr| \le \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1}\,|x-c|$, so dividing by the nonzero $|x-c|$ and using step 1.2 gives $\Bigl|\dfrac{F(x)-F(c)}{x-c} - f(c)\Bigr| \le \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1} < \varepsilon$ for every $x \in [a,b]$ with $0 < |x-c| < \delta$. [step 1.2, step 2.1, step 2.2, L7]

4.1 Since $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary, the limit of the difference quotient of $F$ at $c$ exists and equals $f(c)$ by [L3]; that is, $F'(c) = f(c)$. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L3]

5.1 If $f$ is continuous at every point of $[a,b]$ then step 4.1 applies at every $c \in [a,b]$, so $F' = f$ on $[a,b]$ and $F$ is a primitive of $f$. [step 4.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **The estimate is written out for $x < c$ as well, and that is not redundancy.** For $x < c$ the factor $1/(x-c)$ is negative and the naive chain $m(x-c) \le \int_c^x \le M(x-c)$ reverses; what makes the argument uniform is taking absolute values *before* dividing, which is what steps 2.1, 2.2 and 3.1 do. This is the single most common error in this proof.

- **The route is the definition of the derivative, not the mean value theorem for integrals.** Deducing $F'(c) = f(c)$ from [[thm-first-mean-value-theorem-for-integrals]] would need $f$ continuous on a whole subinterval around $c$, which is a strictly stronger hypothesis than continuity at the single point $c$. The theorem as stated is the sharp one.

- **What is proved at a point is proved at a point.** Nothing here says $F$ is differentiable anywhere else, and nothing says $F' = f$ off the continuity set of $f$. Where $f$ is merely integrable, all that survives is [[thm-the-integral-function-is-lipschitz]].

- **Forward references, orientation only.** The two failures at a discontinuity are worked out on the companion page as [[cex-an-integrable-function-with-no-primitive]] and [[fs-the-integral-function-is-always-a-primitive]]; nothing above depends on either.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals, let $G : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be differentiable at every
point of $[a,b]$ as a function on $[a,b]$ ([[def-derivative]]; at $a$ and $b$
this is the one-sided derivative), let $f := G'$, and suppose $f$ is integrable
on $[a,b]$ ([[def-darboux-integral]]). Then

$$\int_a^b f \;=\; G(b) - G(a) .$$

**Both hypotheses are needed and neither is removable.** A function may be
differentiable everywhere with $G'$ not integrable — then the left-hand side does
not exist (an everywhere differentiable function with unbounded derivative) — and an
integrable $f$ need not be the derivative of anything
(the sign function); both witnesses are on the
companion page.

**No continuity of $f$ is assumed**, which is what makes this the working form:
the theorem evaluates $\int_a^b f$ for every integrable derivative, not only for
continuous integrands.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, a function $G : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ differentiable at every point of $[a,b]$, $f := G'$ integrable on $[a,b]$, and a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[a,b]$.

[L1] For a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[a,b]$: $t_0 = a$, $t_n = b$, $t_i < t_{i+1}$ for $i < n$, $\Delta_i = t_{i+1}-t_i > 0$, and $I_i = [t_i,t_{i+1}] \subseteq [a,b]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-interval]]).

[L2] $L(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}m_i\Delta_i$ and $U(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}M_i\Delta_i$ with $m_i = \inf f[I_i]$ and $M_i = \sup f[I_i]$, so $m_i \le f(\xi) \le M_i$ for every $\xi \in I_i$ ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L3] $\underline{\int_a^b} f = \sup_P L(f,P)$ and $\overline{\int_a^b} f = \inf_P U(f,P)$, and $f$ integrable means the two agree, their common value being $\int_a^b f$ ([[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L4] Mean value theorem: if $u$ is continuous on $[p,q]$ with $p<q$ and differentiable at every point of $(p,q)$, there is $\xi \in (p,q)$ with $u(q)-u(p) = u'(\xi)(q-p)$ ([[cor-mean-value-theorem]]).

[L5] A function differentiable at a point is continuous there, and the restriction of a differentiable function to a subinterval is differentiable with the same derivative at every point of that subinterval which is a limit point of it ([[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]], [[def-derivative]], [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L6] Finite sums: telescoping $\sum_{i<n}(c_{i+1}-c_i) = c_n - c_0$, and monotonicity in the terms ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], clauses 4 and 5).

[L7] Ordered-field arithmetic: multiplying an inequality by a positive real preserves it, the order is total and transitive, and a number that is an upper bound of a set and also a lower bound of another set lies between their supremum and infimum ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $P = (n,t)$ be an arbitrary partition of $[a,b]$ and let $i < n$. The restriction of $G$ to $I_i = [t_i,t_{i+1}]$ is continuous on $I_i$ and differentiable at every point of $(t_i,t_{i+1})$, with the same derivative $f$ there, by [L5] and [L1]. [given, L1, L5]

2.1 By [L4] applied on $I_i$ there is $\xi_i \in (t_i,t_{i+1})$ with $G(t_{i+1}) - G(t_i) = f(\xi_i)\,\Delta_i$; since $\xi_i \in I_i$ and $\Delta_i > 0$, [L2] gives $m_i\Delta_i \le G(t_{i+1})-G(t_i) \le M_i\Delta_i$. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L4, L7]

3.1 Step 2.1 holds for every $i < n$, so monotonicity of finite sums applies to the three families and gives $\sum_{i<n}m_i\Delta_i \le \sum_{i<n}\bigl(G(t_{i+1})-G(t_i)\bigr) \le \sum_{i<n}M_i\Delta_i$. [step 2.1, L6]

4.1 The middle sum telescopes to $G(t_n) - G(t_0) = G(b) - G(a)$ by [L6] and [L1], so $L(f,P) \le G(b)-G(a) \le U(f,P)$ by [L2]. [step 3.1, L1, L2, L6]

5.1 Step 4.1 holds for **every** partition $P$, so $G(b)-G(a)$ is an upper bound of the set of lower sums and a lower bound of the set of upper sums; hence $\underline{\int_a^b} f \le G(b)-G(a) \le \overline{\int_a^b} f$ by [L3] and [L7]. [step 4.1, L3, L7]

6.1 Since $f$ is integrable the two integrals coincide with $\int_a^b f$, so $\int_a^b f = G(b)-G(a)$. [step 5.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **No choice principle is spent, and no sequence of tags is ever formed.** The usual proof selects one $\xi_i$ per subinterval and assembles the Riemann sum $\sum_i f(\xi_i)\Delta_i$, which is a choice from finitely many nonempty sets. The proof above never forms that family: step 2.1 proves, for an arbitrary fixed $i$, the *inequality* $m_i\Delta_i \le G(t_{i+1})-G(t_i) \le M_i\Delta_i$, which is a universally quantified statement about $i$ and needs no selection, and step 3.1 then sums the inequality. The telescoping identity supplies the middle term without any tags at all.

- **The hypothesis is differentiability at every point of the closed interval.** It is not enough to be differentiable on $(a,b)$ and continuous on $[a,b]$ in the argument as written, because step 2.1 uses the derivative only on open subintervals but the definition $f = G'$ has to name a function on all of $[a,b]$ for $\int_a^b f$ to mean anything. Changing $f$ at the two endpoints changes neither its integrability nor its integral ([[lem-changing-a-function-at-finitely-many-points]]), so the reader who prefers the weaker hypothesis loses nothing.

- **This is the half of the fundamental theorem that computes.** The other half, [[thm-ftc-first-part]], produces a primitive; this one evaluates an integral once a primitive is known, and it is the tool the companion page reaches for whenever a primitive is available. Where no primitive is at hand the companion page computes instead by splitting at a jump and using the integral of a constant; no claim is made here about how many of its computations take which route.

- **Forward references, orientation only.** The two witnesses showing neither hypothesis is removable are [[cex-a-function-with-a-primitive-that-is-not-integrable]] and [[cex-an-integrable-function-with-no-primitive]] on the companion page; nothing above depends on either.
