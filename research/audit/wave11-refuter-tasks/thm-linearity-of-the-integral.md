## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]). Then:

1. $f + g$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ and
   $\int_a^b (f+g) = \int_a^b f + \int_a^b g$;
2. for every real $\lambda$, $\lambda f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ and
   $\int_a^b \lambda f = \lambda \int_a^b f$;
3. consequently, for all reals $\lambda, \mu$ the function $\lambda f + \mu g$ is
   integrable and
   $$\int_a^b(\lambda f + \mu g) \;=\; \lambda\int_a^b f \;+\; \mu\int_a^b g ;$$
4. the same identity holds with oriented limits: if $u, v \in [a,b]$ and $f, g$
   are integrable between $u$ and $v$ ([[def-oriented-integral]]), then
   $\int_u^v(\lambda f + \mu g) = \lambda\int_u^v f + \mu\int_u^v g$.

**Linearity of the integral is not linearity of the Darboux sums**, and the
proof of claim 1 has to squeeze rather than compute. On a subinterval the
inequality $\sup(f+g) \le \sup f + \sup g$ can be strict — take $f(x) = x$ and
$g(x) = -x$ on $[0,1]$, where the left side is $0$ and the right side is $1$ —
so $U(f+g,P)$ is in general strictly below $U(f,P) + U(g,P)$ and no identity
between upper sums is available. Claim 2, by contrast, is an identity at the
level of the sums, with the roles of $\sup$ and $\inf$ exchanged when
$\lambda < 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, integrable $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, reals $\lambda, \mu$, and a real $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] Riemann's criterion: a bounded $h$ on $[a,b]$ is integrable if and only if for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a partition $P$ with $U(h,P) - L(h,P) < \eta$ ([[thm-riemann-criterion]]).

[L2] For every partition $P$ and bounded $h$: $L(h,P) \le \underline{\int_a^b} h \le \overline{\int_a^b} h \le U(h,P)$, and $h$ is integrable exactly when the two integrals agree, their common value being $\int_a^b h$; the lower integral is $\sup_P L(h,P)$ and the upper is $\inf_P U(h,P)$ ([[def-darboux-integral]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L3] $L(h,P) = \sum_{i<n} m_i(h)\Delta_i$ and $U(h,P) = \sum_{i<n}M_i(h)\Delta_i$, where $m_i(h) = \inf h[I_i]$ and $M_i(h) = \sup h[I_i]$ over the subintervals $I_i$ of $P = (n,t)$, with $\Delta_i > 0$; an integrable function is bounded, and a sum of two bounded functions and a scalar multiple of a bounded function are bounded ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L4] If $P'$ refines $P$ then $L(h,P) \le L(h,P') \le U(h,P') \le U(h,P)$; the common refinement $P_1 \vee P_2$ refines both ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L5] Finite sums are additive and homogeneous: $\sum_{i<n}(x_i + y_i) = \sum_{i<n}x_i + \sum_{i<n}y_i$ and $\sum_{i<n}\lambda x_i = \lambda\sum_{i<n}x_i$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], clauses 1 and 2).

[L6] A supremum is the least upper bound and an infimum the greatest lower bound; both exist for a nonempty bounded set and are unique ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-infimum]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L7] Reflection: writing $-S = \{-s : s \in S\}$, a real $u$ is an upper bound of $S$ exactly when $-u$ is a lower bound of $-S$, and conversely; hence $\sup(-S) = -\inf S$ and $\inf(-S) = -\sup S$ for nonempty bounded $S$, by [L6] ([[lem-reflection]]).

[L8] The constant function $0$ is integrable with $\int_a^b 0 = 0$ ([[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]]).

[L9] Ordered-field arithmetic: adding a constant and multiplying by a positive quantity preserve an inequality, the order is total and transitive, and a real $x$ with $|x| < \eta$ for every real $\eta > 0$ is $0$ ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order facts are used in their nonstrict form as well, obtained by adjoining the case of equality.

[L10] With oriented limits, $\int_v^u h = -\int_u^v h$ and $\int_u^u h = 0$ ([[def-oriented-integral]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $f$, $g$, $f+g$ and $\lambda f$ are bounded on $[a,b]$, so all their Darboux sums and integrals are defined. [given, L3]

1.2 For every partition $P = (n,t)$ and every $i < n$: $f(x) + g(x) \le M_i(f) + M_i(g)$ for $x \in I_i$, so $M_i(f) + M_i(g)$ is an upper bound of $(f+g)[I_i]$ and $M_i(f+g) \le M_i(f) + M_i(g)$ by [L6]; dually $m_i(f+g) \ge m_i(f) + m_i(g)$. [L3, L6]

1.3 Fix partitions $P_1$ and $P_2$ with $U(f,P_1) - L(f,P_1) < \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$ and $U(g,P_2) - L(g,P_2) < \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$, and put $P := P_1 \vee P_2$. [given, L1, L4, choose]

1.4 **Claim 2, the case $\lambda = 0$.** Then $\lambda f$ is the constant function $0$, integrable with integral $0 = 0 \cdot \int_a^b f$. [L8]

1.5 **Claim 2, the case $\lambda > 0$.** For every partition $P$ and every $i < n$, $\lambda M_i(f)$ is an upper bound of $(\lambda f)[I_i]$, and any upper bound $w$ of $(\lambda f)[I_i]$ gives the upper bound $w/\lambda$ of $f[I_i]$, whence $M_i(f) \le w/\lambda$ and $\lambda M_i(f) \le w$; so $M_i(\lambda f) = \lambda M_i(f)$ by [L6], and dually $m_i(\lambda f) = \lambda m_i(f)$. [L3, L6, L9]

1.6 **Claim 2, the case $\lambda = -1$.** For every $P$ and $i < n$, $(-f)[I_i] = -\bigl(f[I_i]\bigr)$, so $M_i(-f) = -m_i(f)$ and $m_i(-f) = -M_i(f)$ by [L7]. [L3, L7]

2.1 By [L4], $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1}$ and $U(g,P) - L(g,P) < \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$. [step 1.3, L4]

2.2 Summing the inequalities of step 1.2 over $i < n$ against the positive weights $\Delta_i$ and using [L5] gives $L(f,P) + L(g,P) \le L(f+g,P) \le U(f+g,P) \le U(f,P) + U(g,P)$. [step 1.2, L3, L5, L9]

2.3 With step 1.5 and [L5], $U(\lambda f,P) = \lambda U(f,P)$ and $L(\lambda f, P) = \lambda L(f,P)$ for $\lambda > 0$; hence $U(\lambda f,P)-L(\lambda f,P) = \lambda\bigl(U(f,P)-L(f,P)\bigr)$, which [L1] makes smaller than any prescribed positive number by choosing $P$ suitably, so $\lambda f$ is integrable. [step 1.5, L1, L3, L5, L9]

2.4 With step 1.6 and [L5], $U(-f,P) = -L(f,P)$ and $L(-f,P) = -U(f,P)$, so $U(-f,P)-L(-f,P) = U(f,P)-L(f,P)$ and $-f$ is integrable by [L1]; and by [L7] applied to the sets of Darboux sums, $\overline{\int_a^b}(-f) = -\underline{\int_a^b} f$ and $\underline{\int_a^b}(-f) = -\overline{\int_a^b} f$, so $\int_a^b(-f) = -\int_a^b f$. [step 1.6, L1, L2, L5, L7]

3.1 Hence $U(f+g,P) - L(f+g,P) \le \bigl(U(f,P)-L(f,P)\bigr) + \bigl(U(g,P)-L(g,P)\bigr) < \varepsilon$, so $f+g$ is integrable by [L1], $\varepsilon > 0$ having been arbitrary. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, L1, L9]

3.2 Moreover the set of lower sums of $\lambda f$ is $\lambda$ times the set of lower sums of $f$, and a supremum scales by a positive factor, by the argument of step 1.5 applied to that set; so $\underline{\int_a^b}\lambda f = \lambda \underline{\int_a^b} f$, and likewise for the upper integrals, giving $\int_a^b \lambda f = \lambda\int_a^b f$. [step 1.5, step 2.3, L2, L6, L9]

4.1 Both $\int_a^b(f+g)$ and $\int_a^b f + \int_a^b g$ lie in the interval from $L(f,P)+L(g,P)$ to $U(f,P)+U(g,P)$: the first by [L2] and step 2.2, the second by [L2] applied to $f$ and to $g$ separately. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, L2]

4.2 **Claim 2 for $\lambda < 0$.** Then $-\lambda > 0$ and $\lambda f = (-\lambda)(-f)$, so steps 2.3, 2.4 and 3.2 give integrability and the required identities and $\int_a^b \lambda f = (-\lambda)\int_a^b(-f) = (-\lambda)\bigl(-\int_a^b f\bigr) = \lambda\int_a^b f$. [step 2.3, step 3.2, step 2.4, L9]

5.1 That interval has length less than $\varepsilon$ by step 2.1, so $\bigl|\int_a^b(f+g) - \int_a^b f - \int_a^b g\bigr| < \varepsilon$; as $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary the difference is $0$, which is claim 1. [step 2.1, step 4.1, L9]

5.2 Claim 2 is now proved in all three cases $\lambda = 0$, $\lambda > 0$ and $\lambda < 0$, which are exhaustive by trichotomy. [step 1.4, step 2.3, step 3.2, step 4.2, L9]

6.1 **Claim 3.** By claim 2 the functions $\lambda f$ and $\mu g$ are integrable with integrals $\lambda\int_a^b f$ and $\mu\int_a^b g$, and by claim 1 their sum is integrable with the sum of those integrals. [step 5.1, step 5.2]

7.1 **Claim 4.** If $u < v$ then $u, v \in [a,b]$ and claim 3 applies verbatim on $[u,v]$; if $u = v$ both sides are $0$ by [L10]; and if $u > v$ then applying the case $u < v$ to the pair $(v,u)$ and multiplying by $-1$ gives the identity, by [L10]. [step 6.1, L10] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why claim 1 cannot be an identity of Darboux sums.** The example in the statement shows $\sup(f+g) < \sup f + \sup g$ is possible on a single subinterval, so $U(f+g,P) = U(f,P)+U(g,P)$ is false in general. What survives is the pair of inequalities of step 1.2, and they are enough because the gap between them is squeezed to $0$ by [[thm-riemann-criterion]].

- **The two scalar cases really are different.** For $\lambda > 0$ the extreme values scale; for $\lambda < 0$ they are exchanged, because multiplying by a negative reverses the order ([[lem-reflection]]). Merging the cases and writing $U(\lambda f, P) = \lambda U(f,P)$ for all $\lambda$ would be false at $\lambda = -1$, where the correct identity is $U(-f,P) = -L(f,P)$.

- **The set of integrable functions on $[a,b]$ is closed under the operations named here and under more.** Products, absolute values and the lattice operations are also integrable, but none of them is obtained from linearity alone: the proofs of [[cor-integrability-of-absolute-values-products-and-lattice-operations]] all pass through [[thm-composition-with-a-continuous-function]], with linearity used only to recombine the pieces.

For $i = 0$ both equal $a$. Suppose $t_j = t'_j$\nfor all $j \\le i$ and $i + 1 \\le \\min\\{n,n'\\}$. The set\n$S := \\{\\, x \\in \\operatorname{pts}(P) : x > t_i \\,\\}$ has $t_{i+1}$ as its least\nelement: $t_{i+1} \\in S$, and any $x \\in S$ is $t_j$ for some $j \\le n$ with\n$t_j > t_i$, which forces $j > i$ because $t$ is increasing on indices $\\le n$,\nhence $j \\ge i+1$ and $x = t_j \\ge t_{i+1}$. The same argument in $P'$ makes\n$t'_{i+1}$ the least element of\n$\\{\\, x \\in \\operatorname{pts}(P') : x > t'_i \\,\\}$, which is the same set $S$,\nsince the point sets agree and $t'_i = t_i$. A set has at most one least element\n([[def-max-min]]), so $t_{i+1} = t'_{i+1}$.\n\nSecond, $n = n'$. If $n < n'$ then $t'_n = t_n = b$ by the previous paragraph,\nwhile $t'_n < t'_{n'} = b$ because $t'$ is increasing on indices $\\le n'$ and\n$n < n'$; that is impossible. Exchanging the roles of $P$ and $P'$ rules out\n$n' < n$. $\\square$\n\nSo the map $P \\mapsto \\operatorname{pts}(P)$ is injective, and a partition may be\nnamed by its point set whenever one is exhibited.\n\n### Inserting a point\n\nLet $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ and let $c \\in [a,b]$. Define a\npartition $P + c$ of $[a,b]$ as follows.\n\n- If $c \\in \\operatorname{pts}(P)$, put $P + c := P$.\n- Otherwise $c \\ne a$ and $c \\ne b$, so $a < c < b$. The set\n  $T := \\{\\, t_i : i \\le n \\text{ and } t_i < c \\,\\}$ is a nonempty finite set of\n  reals, nonempty because $t_0 = a < c$, so it has a maximum\n  ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]); let $i_0 \\le n$ be the unique index with\n  $t_{i_0} = \\max T$, unique because $t$ is injective on indices $\\le n$. Then\n  $i_0 < n$, since $t_n = b > c$ puts $t_n \\notin T$; and\n  $$t_{i_0} \\;<\\; c \\;<\\; t_{i_0+1},$$\n  the right inequality because $t_{i_0+1} \\ne c$ (as $c \\notin \\operatorname{pts}(P)$)\n  and $t_{i_0+1} < c$ would put $t_{i_0+1} \\in T$ with $t_{i_0+1} > t_{i_0} = \\max T$.\n  Put $P + c := (n+1, s)$ with\n  $$s_i := t_i \\ (i \\le i_0), \\qquad s_{i_0+1} := c, \\qquad s_i := t_{i-1} \\ (i_0 + 2 \\le i \\le n+1), \\qquad s_k := b \\ (k \\ge n+1).$$\n\nIn both cases $P + c$ is a partition of $[a,b]$ and\n\n$$\\operatorname{pts}(P + c) \\;=\\; \\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\{c\\}, \\qquad \\|P+c\\| \\;\\le\\; \\|P\\| .$$\n\nThe displayed identity is immediate from the two cases. For the mesh: in the\nfirst case nothing changes; in the second the list of subinterval lengths of\n$P + c$ is that of $P$ with $\\Delta_{i_0}$ replaced by the two numbers\n$c - t_{i_0}$ and $t_{i_0+1} - c$, each of which is smaller than\n$\\Delta_{i_0} = (c - t_{i_0}) + (t_{i_0+1} - c)$ because the other is positive.\nSo every length of $P + c$ is at most a length of $P$, and the maximum cannot\nincrease. Finally the index count grows by exactly $1$ in the second case and\nnot at all in the first.\n\n### Refinement and the common refinement\n\n$P'$ **refines** $P$, and is a **refinement** of $P$, when\n\n$$\\operatorname{pts}(P) \\;\\subseteq\\; \\operatorname{pts}(P') .$$\n\nLet $P = (n,t)$ and $Q = (m,s)$ be partitions of $[a,b]$. Applying the recursion\ntheorem ([[thm-recursion]]) to the set $\\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$,\nwhere $\\mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$ is the set of partitions of $[a,b]$, with starting\nelement $(0, P)$ and the map $(j, R) \\mapsto (j+1,\\ R + s_j)$ — legitimate\nbecause $s_j \\in [a,b]$ for every $j \\in \\mathbb{N}$ — gives a unique family\n$(R_j)_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ of partitions with $R_0 = P$ and $R_{j+1} = R_j + s_j$.\nThe **common refinement** of $P$ and $Q$ is\n\n$$P \\vee Q \\;:=\\; R_{m+1} .$$\n\n**Its point set is the union.** By induction on $j$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]),\n$\\operatorname{pts}(R_j) = \\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\{\\, s_l : l < j \\,\\}$;\ntaking $j = m+1$ gives\n\n$$\\operatorname{pts}(P \\vee Q) \\;=\\; \\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\operatorname{pts}(Q).$$\n\nHence $P \\vee Q$ refines both $P$ and $Q$; by the uniqueness claim above it is\nthe **only** partition with that point set, so $P \\vee Q = Q \\vee P$, and\n\n$$P' \\text{ refines } P \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad P \\vee P' = P' ,$$\n\nsince then $\\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\operatorname{pts}(P') =\n\\operatorname{pts}(P')$.\n\n**Two size bounds, both used later.** Writing $n_R$ for the first component of a\npartition $R$:\n\n$$\\|P \\vee Q\\| \\;\\le\\; \\|P\\|, \\qquad n_{P \\vee Q} \\;\\le\\; n_P + n_Q - 1 .$$\n\nThe first is the mesh bound above applied $m+1$ times. For the second, each\ninsertion raises the index count by at most $1$, and the two insertions of\n$s_0 = a$ and $s_m = b$ raise it by $0$, since $a$ and $b$ already lie in\n$\\operatorname{pts}(P)$ and hence in $\\operatorname{pts}(R_j)$ for every $j$; so\nat most $m - 1$ of the $m+1$ insertions increase it.\n\n### The index map of a refinement\n\nLet $P' = (n',t')$ refine $P = (n,t)$. For each $i \\le n$ the point $t_i$ lies in\n$\\operatorname{pts}(P')$, so there is exactly one $\\varphi(i) \\le n'$ with\n$t'_{\\varphi(i)} = t_i$, uniqueness because $t'$ is injective on indices $\\le n'$.\nThe resulting map $\\varphi$ satisfies\n\n$$\\varphi(0) = 0, \\qquad \\varphi(n) = n', \\qquad \\varphi(i) < \\varphi(i+1) \\ \\ (i < n),$$\n\nthe first two because $t'_0 = a = t_0$ and $t'_{n'} = b = t_n$ together with\ninjectivity, and the third because $t_i < t_{i+1}$ and $t'$ is increasing on\nindices $\\le n'$. In particular $n \\le n'$. Moreover, for $i < n$ and\n$\\varphi(i) \\le j < \\varphi(i+1)$,\n\n$$I'_j \\;=\\; [\\,t'_j,\\ t'_{j+1}\\,] \\;\\subseteq\\; [\\,t_i,\\ t_{i+1}\\,] \\;=\\; I_i ,$$\n\nbecause $t_i = t'_{\\varphi(i)} \\le t'_j$ and $t'_{j+1} \\le t'_{\\varphi(i+1)} = t_{i+1}$.\n\n**The blocks are counted by telescoping.** By clause 5 of\n[[lem-finite-sum-laws]],\n$\\sum_{i<n}\\big(\\varphi(i+1) - \\varphi(i)\\big) = \\varphi(n) - \\varphi(0) = n'$,\nso, subtracting $\\sum_{i<n} 1 = n$,\n\n$$\\sum_{i<n} \\big(\\varphi(i+1) - \\varphi(i) - 1\\big) \\;=\\; n' - n ,$$\n\na sum of $n$ nonnegative integers, one for each block, which vanishes exactly at\nthe blocks consisting of a single index. This identity is the whole content of\nthe quantitative bound in [[lem-refinement-inequalities]], and it is also why\n$n \\le n'$.\n\nFinally, the lengths inside a block sum to the length of the block:\n\n$$\\sum_{j = \\varphi(i)}^{\\varphi(i+1)-1} \\Delta'_j \\;=\\; t'_{\\varphi(i+1)} - t'_{\\varphi(i)} \\;=\\; t_{i+1} - t_i \\;=\\; \\Delta_i \\qquad (i < n),$$\n\nagain by telescoping, applied to the sequence $l \\mapsto t'_{\\varphi(i)+l}$ and\nread through the index-shift convention of [[def-finite-sum]].",

Then\n  $i_0 < n$, since $t_n = b > c$ puts $t_n \\notin T$; and\n  $$t_{i_0} \\;<\\; c \\;<\\; t_{i_0+1},$$\n  the right inequality because $t_{i_0+1} \\ne c$ (as $c \\notin \\operatorname{pts}(P)$)\n  and $t_{i_0+1} < c$ would put $t_{i_0+1} \\in T$ with $t_{i_0+1} > t_{i_0} = \\max T$.\n  Put $P + c := (n+1, s)$ with\n  $$s_i := t_i \\ (i \\le i_0), \\qquad s_{i_0+1} := c, \\qquad s_i := t_{i-1} \\ (i_0 + 2 \\le i \\le n+1), \\qquad s_k := b \\ (k \\ge n+1).$$\n\nIn both cases $P + c$ is a partition of $[a,b]$ and\n\n$$\\operatorname{pts}(P + c) \\;=\\; \\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\{c\\}, \\qquad \\|P+c\\| \\;\\le\\; \\|P\\| .$$\n\nThe displayed identity is immediate from the two cases. For the mesh: in the\nfirst case nothing changes; in the second the list of subinterval lengths of\n$P + c$ is that of $P$ with $\\Delta_{i_0}$ replaced by the two numbers\n$c - t_{i_0}$ and $t_{i_0+1} - c$, each of which is smaller than\n$\\Delta_{i_0} = (c - t_{i_0}) + (t_{i_0+1} - c)$ because the other is positive.\nSo every length of $P + c$ is at most a length of $P$, and the maximum cannot\nincrease. Finally the index count grows by exactly $1$ in the second case and\nnot at all in the first.\n\n### Refinement and the common refinement\n\n$P'$ **refines** $P$, and is a **refinement** of $P$, when\n\n$$\\operatorname{pts}(P) \\;\\subseteq\\; \\operatorname{pts}(P') .$$\n\nLet $P = (n,t)$ and $Q = (m,s)$ be partitions of $[a,b]$. Applying the recursion\ntheorem ([[thm-recursion]]) to the set $\\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$,\nwhere $\\mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$ is the set of partitions of $[a,b]$, with starting\nelement $(0, P)$ and the map $(j, R) \\mapsto (j+1,\\ R + s_j)$ — legitimate\nbecause $s_j \\in [a,b]$ for every $j \\in \\mathbb{N}$ — gives a unique family\n$(R_j)_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ of partitions with $R_0 = P$ and $R_{j+1} = R_j + s_j$.\nThe **common refinement** of $P$ and $Q$ is\n\n$$P \\vee Q \\;:=\\; R_{m+1} .$$\n\n**Its point set is the union.** By induction on $j$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]),\n$\\operatorname{pts}(R_j) = \\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\{\\, s_l : l < j \\,\\}$;\ntaking $j = m+1$ gives\n\n$$\\operatorname{pts}(P \\vee Q) \\;=\\; \\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\operatorname{pts}(Q).$$\n\nHence $P \\vee Q$ refines both $P$ and $Q$; by the uniqueness claim above it is\nthe **only** partition with that point set, so $P \\vee Q = Q \\vee P$, and\n\n$$P' \\text{ refines } P \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad P \\vee P' = P' ,$$\n\nsince then $\\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\operatorname{pts}(P') =\n\\operatorname{pts}(P')$.\n\n**Two size bounds, both used later.** Writing $n_R$ for the first component of a\npartition $R$:\n\n$$\\|P \\vee Q\\| \\;\\le\\; \\|P\\|, \\qquad n_{P \\vee Q} \\;\\le\\; n_P + n_Q - 1 .$$\n\nThe first is the mesh bound above applied $m+1$ times. For the second, each\ninsertion raises the index count by at most $1$, and the two insertions of\n$s_0 = a$ and $s_m = b$ raise it by $0$, since $a$ and $b$ already lie in\n$\\operatorname{pts}(P)$ and hence in $\\operatorname{pts}(R_j)$ for every $j$; so\nat most $m - 1$ of the $m+1$ insertions increase it.\n\n### The index map of a refinement\n\nLet $P' = (n',t')$ refine $P = (n,t)$. For each $i \\le n$ the point $t_i$ lies in\n$\\operatorname{pts}(P')$, so there is exactly one $\\varphi(i) \\le n'$ with\n$t'_{\\varphi(i)} = t_i$, uniqueness because $t'$ is injective on indices $\\le n'$.\nThe resulting map $\\varphi$ satisfies\n\n$$\\varphi(0) = 0, \\qquad \\varphi(n) = n', \\qquad \\varphi(i) < \\varphi(i+1) \\ \\ (i < n),$$\n\nthe first two because $t'_0 = a = t_0$ and $t'_{n'} = b = t_n$ together with\ninjectivity, and the third because $t_i < t_{i+1}$ and $t'$ is increasing on\nindices $\\le n'$. In particular $n \\le n'$. Moreover, for $i < n$ and\n$\\varphi(i) \\le j < \\varphi(i+1)$,\n\n$$I'_j \\;=\\; [\\,t'_j,\\ t'_{j+1}\\,] \\;\\subseteq\\; [\\,t_i,\\ t_{i+1}\\,] \\;=\\; I_i ,$$\n\nbecause $t_i = t'_{\\varphi(i)} \\le t'_j$ and $t'_{j+1} \\le t'_{\\varphi(i+1)} = t_{i+1}$.\n\n**The blocks are counted by telescoping.** By clause 5 of\n[[lem-finite-sum-laws]],\n$\\sum_{i<n}\\big(\\varphi(i+1) - \\varphi(i)\\big) = \\varphi(n) - \\varphi(0) = n'$,\nso, subtracting $\\sum_{i<n} 1 = n$,\n\n$$\\sum_{i<n} \\big(\\varphi(i+1) - \\varphi(i) - 1\\big) \\;=\\; n' - n ,$$\n\na sum of $n$ nonnegative integers, one for each block, which vanishes exactly at\nthe blocks consisting of a single index.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]). Then:

1. $|f|$, $f^{2}$ and $fg$ are integrable on $[a,b]$
   ([[def-abs-value]], [[def-integer-power]]);
2. $\max(f,g)$ and $\min(f,g)$, defined pointwise
   ([[def-max-min]]), are integrable on $[a,b]$;
3. the **triangle inequality for the integral**:
   $$\Bigl|\int_a^b f\Bigr| \;\le\; \int_a^b |f| .$$

**Claim 3 is stated with $a < b$ and is not orientation-invariant.** For $u > v$
the right-hand side is $-\int_v^u |f| \le 0$ while the left-hand side is $\ge 0$,
so the inequality as written is false there. The form valid for *every* pair
$u,v$ on which $f$ is integrable ([[def-oriented-integral]]) is

$$\Bigl|\int_u^v f\Bigr| \;\le\; \Bigl|\int_u^v |f|\,\Bigr| ,$$

and that is the form the estimates below on this page use whenever the limits
are not known to be in increasing order.

**The converse of claim 1 fails.** Integrability of $|f|$ does not give
integrability of $f$; the witness is on the companion page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and integrable $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] If $u$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ with values in $[m,M]$ and $\varphi$ is continuous on $[m,M]$, then $\varphi\circ u$ is integrable ([[thm-composition-with-a-continuous-function]]); an integrable function is bounded, so such $m$ and $M$ exist ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-bounded-set]], [[def-interval]]).

[L2] Sums and scalar multiples of integrable functions are integrable, with $\int_a^b(\lambda u + \nu w) = \lambda\int_a^b u + \nu\int_a^b w$ ([[thm-linearity-of-the-integral]]).

[L3] If $u \le w$ pointwise on $[a,b]$ and both are integrable then $\int_a^b u \le \int_a^b w$ ([[thm-monotonicity-of-the-integral]]).

[L4] The absolute value $t \mapsto |t|$, the square $t \mapsto t^{2}$ and every polynomial function are continuous on every subset of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], claims 2 and 5, [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L5] For reals $s,t$: $\max\{s,t\} = (s + t + |s-t|)\cdot 2^{-1}$ and $\min\{s,t\} = (s + t - |s-t|)\cdot 2^{-1}$, and $st = \bigl((s+t)^{2} - (s-t)^{2}\bigr)\cdot 4^{-1}$ ([[def-max-min]], [[def-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L6] Absolute value: $-|t| \le t \le |t|$, and $|t| \le c$ follows from $-c \le t \le c$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]]).

[L7] With oriented limits, $\int_v^u u = -\int_u^v u$ and $\int_u^u u = 0$ ([[def-oriented-integral]]).

[L8] Ordered-field arithmetic: adding constants and multiplying by positive reals preserve inequalities, and the order is total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $f$ is bounded, so fix reals $m \le M$ with $f[\,[a,b]\,] \subseteq [m,M]$; the same for $g$, and for $f+g$ and $f-g$, which are integrable by [L2]. [given, L1, L2, choose]

1.2 The maps $t \mapsto |t|$ and $t \mapsto t^{2}$ are continuous on any closed bounded interval, by [L4]. [L4]

2.1 By [L1] applied with $\varphi(t) = |t|$ to $f$, to $g$ and to $f-g$, the functions $|f|$, $|g|$ and $|f-g|$ are integrable. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1]

2.2 By [L1] applied with $\varphi(t) = t^{2}$ to $f$, to $f+g$ and to $f-g$, the functions $f^{2}$, $(f+g)^{2}$ and $(f-g)^{2}$ are integrable. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1]

3.1 By [L5], $fg = \bigl((f+g)^{2}-(f-g)^{2}\bigr)\cdot 4^{-1}$ pointwise, so $fg$ is integrable by [L2]; this completes claim 1. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L2, L5]

3.2 By [L5], $\max(f,g) = \bigl(f + g + |f-g|\bigr)\cdot 2^{-1}$ and $\min(f,g) = \bigl(f+g-|f-g|\bigr)\cdot 2^{-1}$ pointwise, so both are integrable by [L2]; this is claim 2. [step 2.1, L2, L5]

3.3 **Claim 3.** By [L6], $-|f| \le f \le |f|$ pointwise on $[a,b]$, and all three functions are integrable by step 2.1 and [L2]. [step 2.1, L2, L6]

4.1 By [L3] applied twice, $-\int_a^b|f| \le \int_a^b f \le \int_a^b |f|$, using $\int_a^b(-|f|) = -\int_a^b|f|$ from [L2]. [step 3.3, L2, L3]

5.1 Hence $\bigl|\int_a^b f\bigr| \le \int_a^b|f|$ by [L6], which is claim 3. [step 4.1, L6]

6.1 **The oriented form.** For $u = v$ both sides are $0$ by [L7]; for $u < v$ it is claim 3 on $[u,v]$; and for $u > v$ both $\int_u^v f$ and $\int_u^v |f|$ are the negatives of the corresponding integrals over $[v,u]$ by [L7], so the two absolute values are unchanged and claim 3 on $[v,u]$ gives the inequality. [step 5.1, L7, L8] ∎

## Remarks

- **Every integrability clause comes from one theorem plus linearity.** The only input that produces integrability is [[thm-composition-with-a-continuous-function]], with [[thm-linearity-of-the-integral]] recombining the pieces; claim 3 additionally uses [[thm-monotonicity-of-the-integral]], which is the one place an inequality between integrals is needed. The identities of [L5] are algebra, and they are what turns a statement about composing with $|\cdot|$ and $(\cdot)^2$ into statements about products and lattice operations. In particular no new estimate on Darboux sums is made here.

- **The polarisation identity is used, and it is why $f^2$ comes first.** There is no direct route from integrability of $f$ and of $g$ to integrability of $fg$ through the composition theorem, because $(s,t) \mapsto st$ is a function of two variables and the theorem composes with one. Writing $fg$ through squares of sums and differences reduces it to the one-variable case.

- **The inequality of claim 3 is the integral analogue of the triangle inequality**, and like it, it can be strict: for $f(x) = x$ on $[-1,1]$ the left-hand side is $0$ and the right-hand side is $1$.

- **Forward reference, orientation only.** The witness refuting the converse of claim 1 is [[cex-absolute-value-integrable-without-the-function]] on the companion page; nothing above depends on it.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ denotes the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a subset of it.

The notions **upper bound** and **bounded above** are already fixed by
[[def-complete-ordered-field]] and are only recalled here, never redefined:
$u \in \mathbb{R}$ is an *upper bound* of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$, and
$S$ is *bounded above* if it has at least one upper bound. The dual notions are:

- $\ell \in \mathbb{R}$ is a **lower bound** of $S$ if $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.
- $S$ is **bounded below** if it has at least one lower bound.
- $S$ is **bounded** if it is both bounded above and bounded below, that is, if
  there are $\ell, u \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\ell \le s \le u$ for every $s \in S$.

## Remarks

- A bound is an element of $\mathbb{R}$ and is not required to lie in $S$. A
  bound that does lie in $S$ is a maximum or a minimum ([[def-max-min]]), and
  that is a strictly stronger condition ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Bounds come in half-lines: if $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$ then so is every
  $\ell'' \le \ell$, and if $u$ is an upper bound then so is every $u'' \ge u$.
  Consequently a set that has one bound of a given kind has infinitely many, and
  the interesting question is whether the collection of them has a best element,
  which is what a supremum ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) or an infimum
  ([[def-infimum]]) is.
- Bounded above and bounded below are independent conditions. The set
  $A = \{\, n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} : n \ge 1 \,\}$ of canonical naturals of
  $\mathbb{R}$ is bounded below by $0$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]) and is not
  bounded above ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); its reflection $-A$ is bounded above
  and not bounded below ([[lem-reflection]]).
- The empty set is bounded, and vacuously so: every real number is both an upper
  bound and a lower bound of $\emptyset$, since the defining condition quantifies
  over no elements. Having bounds is therefore much weaker than having a least
  upper bound or a greatest lower bound ([[fs-every-set-has-sup]]).

## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq F$.

- $u \in F$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$; $S$ is
  **bounded above** if it has an upper bound.
- $u \in F$ is a **least upper bound** (or **supremum**, $\sup S$) of $S$ if $u$
  is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le u'$ for every upper bound $u'$ of $S$.

$F$ is a **complete ordered field** (equivalently, $F$ has the
**least-upper-bound property**, or is **Dedekind complete**) if every nonempty
$S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$.

## Remarks

- A least upper bound, if it exists, is unique (two least upper bounds are each
  $\le$ the other, so equal by antisymmetry of the order).
- Applying the property to $\{-s : s \in S\}$ yields the dual **greatest lower
  bound** (infimum) property, so the two are equivalent.
- The Dedekind-cut reals have this property by construction
  ([[thm-dedekind-complete]]); the Cauchy-sequence reals acquire it via
  [[cor-cauchy-reals-lub-complete]]. This definition is the target for the
  uniqueness theorem [[thm-uniqueness-complete-ordered-field]].

## Definition

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]). Write $\mathcal{P}$ for the set of all partitions of
$[a,b]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]) and put

$$\mathcal{L} \;:=\; \{\, L(f,P) \ : \ P \in \mathcal{P} \,\}, \qquad \mathcal{U} \;:=\; \{\, U(f,P) \ : \ P \in \mathcal{P} \,\}$$

for the sets of lower and of upper Darboux sums ([[def-darboux-sums]]).

### Both extrema exist

**$\mathcal{P}$ is nonempty**: the pair $(1, t)$ with $t_0 := a$ and $t_k := b$
for $k \ge 1$ is a partition of $[a,b]$, since $a < b$. So $\mathcal{L}$ and
$\mathcal{U}$ are nonempty.

**$\mathcal{L}$ is bounded above and $\mathcal{U}$ is bounded below.** Fix any
$Q \in \mathcal{P}$. By claim 2 of [[lem-refinement-inequalities]],
$L(f,P) \le U(f,Q)$ for every $P \in \mathcal{P}$, so $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound
of $\mathcal{L}$; and $L(f,Q) \le U(f,P)$ for every $P$, so $L(f,Q)$ is a lower
bound of $\mathcal{U}$.

Hence a nonempty set bounded above has a supremum
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and a nonempty set bounded below has an infimum
([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]), each unique ([[lem-sup-unique]]).
The **lower** and **upper Darboux integrals** of $f$ over $[a,b]$ are the real
numbers

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;:=\; \sup \mathcal{L} \;=\; \sup_{P} L(f,P), \qquad \overline{\int_a^b} f \;:=\; \inf \mathcal{U} \;=\; \inf_{P} U(f,P) .$$

### The lower integral never exceeds the upper one

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f .$$

Indeed, for each fixed $Q \in \mathcal{P}$ the number $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound
of $\mathcal{L}$, so the least upper bound satisfies
$\underline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,Q)$. As $Q$ was arbitrary, $\underline{\int_a^b}f$
is a lower bound of $\mathcal{U}$, and the greatest lower bound satisfies
$\underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f$ ([[def-infimum]]).

Moreover, for **every** partition $P$,

$$L(f,P) \;\le\; \underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; U(f,P) ,$$

the outer inequalities because a member of a set is at most its supremum and at
least its infimum.

### Integrability

$f$ is **Darboux integrable on $[a,b]$**, and on this page simply
**integrable**, when

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;=\; \overline{\int_a^b} f ,$$

and then the common value is written

$$\int_a^b f \qquad \text{or} \qquad \int_a^b f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x ,$$

the **integral of $f$ over $[a,b]$**. It is a single well-determined real
number, being the common value of two numbers each of which is unique
([[lem-sup-unique]]). Without the displayed equality the symbol $\int_a^b f$ is
not defined and is never written.

**The inequality above is the whole difficulty.** By the previous paragraph
integrability is *never* a question of one integral exceeding the other, only of
the gap $\overline{\int_a^b} f - \underline{\int_a^b} f \ge 0$ being $0$; and by
[[thm-riemann-criterion]] that gap is $0$ exactly when a single partition can be
found making $U(f,P) - L(f,P)$ small. Whether that is possible is settled
completely, in terms of the discontinuities of $f$, by
[[thm-lebesgue-criterion]].

**"Riemann integrable" means the same thing here.** The definition above is
Darboux's. Riemann's own definition, in terms of tagged partitions of small
mesh, is [[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]], and the two define the same
class of functions with the same integral by [[thm-darboux-equals-riemann]].
Until that theorem is proved the two phrases are kept apart; after it they are
used interchangeably, as they are throughout the literature.

## Remarks

- **The supremum is over all partitions, and nothing is selected.** Both
  $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{U}$ are sets determined by $f$ and $[a,b]$ alone,
  and $\sup$ and $\inf$ are canonical, so no choice principle is involved in
  forming either integral. Where a choice does enter on this page is recorded in
  [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].

- **Why the lower integral is a supremum and not an infimum.** Refining a
  partition can only increase a lower sum and decrease an upper sum
  ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]]), so the lower sums push up towards the
  integral and the upper sums push down towards it. Taking $\inf \mathcal{L}$
  would return the sum over the coarsest partition and would carry no
  information about $f$ beyond its infimum on $[a,b]$.

- **A bounded $f$ always has both integrals; only their equality can fail.** The
  Dirichlet function on $[0,1]$ has lower integral $0$ and upper integral $1$
  ([[fs-bounded-implies-riemann-integrable]]), which is the standard witness that
  the definition above is not vacuous in either direction.

## Definition

Let $a < b$ be reals, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be **bounded**
([[def-bounded-set]]), so that there is a real $M \ge 0$ with $|f(x)| \le M$ for
every $x \in [a,b]$, and let $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ with
subintervals $I_i = [t_i, t_{i+1}]$ and lengths $\Delta_i = t_{i+1} - t_i$ for
$i < n$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

### The two extreme values on a subinterval

For $i < n$ put

$$m_i \;:=\; \inf f[I_i], \qquad M_i \;:=\; \sup f[I_i], \qquad f[I_i] \;=\; \{\, f(x) : x \in I_i \,\} .$$

**Both exist.** The set $f[I_i]$ is nonempty, because $t_i < t_{i+1}$ makes $I_i$
nonempty ([[def-interval]]), and it is bounded, because $|f(x)| \le M$ for every
$x$ ([[def-bounded-set]]). A nonempty set bounded above has a supremum
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and a nonempty set bounded below has an infimum
([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]); each is unique, so the notations
$\inf f[I_i]$ and $\sup f[I_i]$ name single real numbers ([[lem-sup-unique]]).

**They bracket the values, and each other.** For $x \in I_i$,

$$-M \;\le\; m_i \;\le\; f(x) \;\le\; M_i \;\le\; M ,$$

the outer inequalities because $-M$ is a lower bound and $M$ an upper bound of
$f[I_i]$, and the middle ones by the definitions of infimum and supremum. In
particular $m_i \le M_i$ and $M_i - m_i \le 2M$.

The dependence of $m_i$ and $M_i$ on $f$ and on $P$ is suppressed in the
notation, as is customary; where two partitions are in play the sums below carry
the partition and the extreme values are written out.

### The two Darboux sums

$$L(f,P) \;:=\; \sum_{i<n} m_i \,\Delta_i, \qquad U(f,P) \;:=\; \sum_{i<n} M_i \,\Delta_i ,$$

the finite sums of [[def-finite-sum]], indexed by $i \in \mathbb{N}$ with
$i < n$. Both are real numbers, being finite sums of reals, and

$$L(f,P) \;\le\; U(f,P) ,$$

by monotonicity of finite sums, clause 4 of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], since
$m_i \Delta_i \le M_i \Delta_i$ for every $i < n$: multiplying $m_i \le M_i$ by
$\Delta_i > 0$ preserves the inequality ([[def-ordered-field]]).

### The gap on a subinterval is the oscillation there

For every $i < n$,

$$M_i - m_i \;=\; \omega_f(I_i) \;=\; \sup\{\, |f(x) - f(y)| \ : \ x, y \in I_i \,\} ,$$

the oscillation of $f$ on the set $I_i$ ([[def-oscillation]]). The supremum is a
real number here rather than an extended one, because $f$ is bounded
([[def-oscillation]], [[def-extended-reals]]). The identity is proved in two
inequalities.

*The oscillation is at most the gap.* For $x, y \in I_i$ both $f(x)$ and $f(y)$
lie in $[m_i, M_i]$, so $f(x) - f(y) \le M_i - m_i$ and
$f(y) - f(x) \le M_i - m_i$, whence $|f(x) - f(y)| \le M_i - m_i$
([[lem-of-abs-value]]). So $M_i - m_i$ is an upper bound of the set whose
supremum is $\omega_f(I_i)$.

*The gap is at most the oscillation.* Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real. By the
$\varepsilon$-characterisations of the supremum and the infimum
([[lem-sup-epsilon]], [[lem-inf-epsilon]]) there are $x, y \in I_i$ with
$f(x) > M_i - \varepsilon/2$ and $f(y) < m_i + \varepsilon/2$; then

$$|f(x) - f(y)| \;\ge\; f(x) - f(y) \;>\; (M_i - m_i) - \varepsilon ,$$

so $\omega_f(I_i) > (M_i - m_i) - \varepsilon$. As $\varepsilon > 0$ was
arbitrary, $\omega_f(I_i) \ge M_i - m_i$: otherwise
$\varepsilon := (M_i - m_i) - \omega_f(I_i)$ would be positive and give
$\omega_f(I_i) > \omega_f(I_i)$.

This identity is what connects the Darboux machinery to the pointwise
oscillation of [[def-oscillation]], and it is the hinge of
[[thm-lebesgue-criterion]].

## Remarks

- **Boundedness is a hypothesis of the definition, not of the theorems.** Without
  it $f[I_i]$ may fail to have a supremum in $\mathbb{R}$ and $U(f,P)$ is not
  defined at all. Every statement on this page that mentions $L$ or $U$ therefore
  carries "bounded $f$" in its hypotheses, and none of them is a restriction that
  could be lifted: an unbounded function has no Darboux sums to compare.

- **Why the infimum and the supremum, and not a value of $f$.** Replacing $m_i$
  by $f(\xi_i)$ for a point $\xi_i \in I_i$ gives the Riemann sums of
  [[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]], which depend on a choice of points
  and are not extremal. The Darboux sums are canonical functions of $f$ and $P$
  alone, which is what makes the supremum and infimum over all partitions in
  [[def-darboux-integral]] well posed without any selection.

- **The empty sum does not occur.** A partition has $n \ge 1$
  ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]), so $L(f,P)$ and $U(f,P)$ are sums of at
  least one term. The first term is $m_0 \Delta_0$, over the subinterval
  $[a, t_1]$; the indexing starts at $i = 0$ throughout this page.

## Definition

Throughout this page $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), in particular an ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]]) and a field ([[def-field]]), and $\mathbb{N}$ is the set
of natural numbers ([[def-natural-numbers]]) with successor $\sigma(n) = n + 1$
([[def-nat-addition]]).

Let $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a sequence of reals, written $a_k$ for
$a(k)$. **Finite sums and finite products of $a$ are defined by recursion on the
upper index**, which is legitimate because of the recursion theorem
([[thm-recursion]]). That theorem produces a function of one variable, so the
running index has to be carried along inside the value: applying it to the set
$A = \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$, the starting element $(0, 0)$ and the function
$f(n, s) = (\sigma(n),\, s + a_n)$ gives a unique
$g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$ with

$$g(0) = (0, 0), \qquad g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n)) \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Write $g(n) = \big(\pi_1(g(n)),\, \Sigma_n\big)$ for its two coordinates.

**The first coordinate is the index itself, and that is a small induction, not an
observation** ([[thm-induction-principle]]). Indeed $\pi_1(g(0)) = 0$; and if
$\pi_1(g(n)) = n$, then
$g(\sigma(n)) = f\big(\pi_1(g(n)), \Sigma_n\big) = \big(\sigma(\pi_1(g(n))),\, \Sigma_n + a_{\pi_1(g(n))}\big) = \big(\sigma(n),\, \Sigma_n + a_n\big)$,
so $\pi_1(g(\sigma(n))) = \sigma(n)$. By induction $\pi_1(g(n)) = n$ for every
$n \in \mathbb{N}$. Only now may the second coordinate of the two displayed
clauses be read off, and doing so gives

$$\Sigma_0 = 0, \qquad \Sigma_{\sigma(n)} = \Sigma_n + a_n .$$

$\Sigma$ is moreover the **unique** function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with those
two properties: if $\Sigma'$ also has them then $n \mapsto (n, \Sigma'_n)$ satisfies
the two clauses defining $g$, hence equals $g$ by the uniqueness clause of
[[thm-recursion]], so $\Sigma' = \Sigma$.

We write $\sum_{k < n} a_k := \Sigma_n$. The same construction with starting
element $(0, 1)$ and $f(n, p) = (\sigma(n),\, p \cdot a_n)$, with the same
induction on the first coordinate and the same uniqueness argument, gives the
unique $\Pi : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with

$$\Pi_0 = 1, \qquad \Pi_{\sigma(n)} = \Pi_n \cdot a_n ,$$

and we write $\prod_{k < n} a_k := \Pi_n$.

**Notation.** For $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ we abbreviate

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \sum_{k < n+1} a_k, \qquad \prod_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \prod_{k < n+1} a_k,$$

and, for a general lower index $m$ with $m \le n + 1$, writing $d = n + 1 - m$
for the number of terms,

$$\sum_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \sum_{j < d} a_{m+j}, \qquad \prod_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \prod_{j < d} a_{m+j} .$$

When $m = n + 1$ we have $d = 0$ and the sum is **empty**, with value $0$, while
the empty product has value $1$. In the same spirit $\sum_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ is
notation for the empty sum $\Sigma_0 = 0$ and $\prod_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ for the
empty product $\Pi_0 = 1$; the index $-1$ never occurs as an element of
$\mathbb{N}$ and is only a way of writing "no terms".

Only finitely many values of $a$ enter $\sum_{k<n} a_k$, so the notation
$\sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\prod_{k<n} a_k$ is also used for a list
$a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$ of reals given without reference to any extension of the
list to all of $\mathbb{N}$: extend the list by $a_k = 0$ (respectively
$a_k = 1$) for $k \ge n$ and apply the definition above.

## Remarks

- **Why recursion and not "$a_0 + a_1 + \cdots + a_{n-1}$".** The dots are not a
  definition: they presuppose that the displayed pattern determines a value for
  every $n$, which is exactly what the recursion theorem
  ([[thm-recursion]]) supplies, and its uniqueness clause is what makes
  $\sum_{k<n} a_k$ a single well-determined real rather than a family of choices.
  Associativity and commutativity of addition are *not* used in the definition;
  they are used in the laws proved from it ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).
- **Naturals and rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$ (a convention used on the whole
  page).** A natural number $n$ and a rational number $r$ are not literally
  elements of $\mathbb{R}$: they enter $\mathbb{R}$ through the canonical
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$, which is an injective,
  order-preserving field homomorphism ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), restricting on
  positive naturals to $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} = 1_\mathbb{R} + \cdots + 1_\mathbb{R}$
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). Following ordinary practice, and only where no
  confusion is possible, we write $n$ for $\iota(n)$ and $r$ for $\iota(r)$; so,
  for instance, $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k<n} a_k$ means
  $\iota(n)^{-1} \cdot \sum_{k<n} a_k$, which makes sense because
  $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$. Exponents are the one place where the
  identification is deliberately NOT made: in $a^n$ and $a^r$ the exponent stays
  a natural, an integer or a rational ([[def-integer-power]],
  [[def-rational-power]]), never a real.
- The two indexings are related by $\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k = \sum_{k < n+1} a_k$, so
  a statement proved for one is available for the other. Sums over $k < n$ are
  the primitive form here because $\Sigma_0$, the empty sum, is then the base
  case of every induction, and no index outside $\mathbb{N}$ is ever needed.

## Definition

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $\ell \in \mathbb{R}$. Then $\ell$ is a
**greatest lower bound**, or **infimum**, of $S$ if both of the following hold:

- $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$ ([[def-bounded-set]]), that is, $\ell \le s$ for
  every $s \in S$;
- $\ell' \le \ell$ for every lower bound $\ell'$ of $S$.

Written out in one line:

$$\ell \text{ is an infimum of } S \iff \big[(\forall s \in S)\, \ell \le s\big] \text{ and } \big[(\forall \ell' \in \mathbb{R})\, \big((\forall s \in S)\, \ell' \le s\big) \Rightarrow \ell' \le \ell\big].$$

An infimum, when it exists, is unique ([[lem-sup-unique]]), so we may write
$\inf S$ for it.

## Remarks

- This is the exact dual of the least upper bound (supremum) of
  [[def-complete-ordered-field]]: reverse every inequality and swap "least" for
  "greatest". The two notions are related by reflection through $0$
  ([[lem-reflection]]).
- Existence is deliberately *not* part of the definition. That every nonempty
  subset of $\mathbb{R}$ which is bounded below actually has an infimum is a
  theorem, [[thm-infimum-property]], derived from the least-upper-bound property;
  it is not an axiom and it is not free.
- As with a supremum, an infimum need not belong to $S$; when it does, it is the
  minimum of $S$ ([[def-max-min]]).
- The usable form of the definition in later arguments is the epsilon
  characterisation [[lem-inf-epsilon]]: $\ell = \inf S$ exactly when $\ell$ is a
  lower bound that cannot be raised by any positive amount without losing that
  property.

## Definition

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ ([[def-field]]) together with a subset
$P \subseteq F$, the set of **positive** elements (the *positive cone*),
satisfying:

- **(O1) Trichotomy.** For each $x \in F$, exactly one of the following holds:
  $x \in P$, or $x = 0$, or $-x \in P$.
- **(O2) Closure.** If $x, y \in P$ then $x + y \in P$ and $x \cdot y \in P$.

We write $x > 0$ for $x \in P$ (read "$x$ is positive"), and define the order by

$$a < b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; b - a \in P, \qquad a \le b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; a < b \text{ or } a = b.$$

Thus $a > b$ means $b < a$, and $a \ge b$ means $b \le a$. An element $x$ with
$-x \in P$ (equivalently $x < 0$) is called **negative**.

## Remarks

- By trichotomy applied to $b - a$, for any $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$,
  $a = b$, $a > b$ holds; this makes $\le$ a total order.
- (O2) says the positives are closed under addition and multiplication: sums and
  products of positives are positive.
- The rationals ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and both constructions of the reals
  ([[thm-reals-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-dedekind-ordered-field]]) are ordered
  fields, so every fact proved here from (O1)-(O2) holds in each of them.

## Definition

**Why this item is first.** The published definition of the integral does not
cover this page. [[def-darboux-integral]] is stated for reals $a < b$, because
the partitions it quantifies over are those of [[def-partition-and-refinement]],
whose standing hypothesis is $a < b$: with $a = b$ the chain
$a = t_0 < \dots < t_n = b$ is unsatisfiable. So $\int_a^b f$ is an undefined
symbol whenever $a \ge b$, and every additivity statement below would be
ill-formed as it is usually written. This item extends the notation, and nothing
else: the object it names is still the Darboux integral of
[[def-darboux-integral]].

Let $u, v \in \mathbb{R}$ and write

$$[u \wedge v,\ u \vee v] \;:=\; \text{the closed interval with endpoints } u \text{ and } v$$

([[def-interval]]). Let $f$ be a real-valued function whose domain contains that
interval. Say that **$f$ is integrable between $u$ and $v$** when either $u = v$,
or $u \ne v$ and the restriction of $f$ to $[u \wedge v,\ u \vee v]$ is bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]) and Darboux integrable there ([[def-darboux-integral]],
[[def-darboux-sums]]). For such $f$ define

$$\int_u^v f \;:=\; \begin{cases} \text{the Darboux integral of } f \text{ over } [u,v] & \text{if } u < v, \\[2pt] 0 & \text{if } u = v, \\[2pt] -\displaystyle\int_v^u f & \text{if } u > v. \end{cases}$$

**There is nothing to check for consistency.** The three clauses are indexed by
the three cases of trichotomy, $u < v$, $u = v$ and $u > v$, which are mutually
exclusive and exhaustive; no pair of them ever applies to the same $(u,v)$. In
particular the first clause is untouched, so on $u < v$ this is the published
integral verbatim and every published theorem about it applies unchanged.

**The middle clause is a stipulation, not a computation.** It is *not* claimed
that $0$ is a value forced by the $u < v$ definition in any limiting sense; that
definition simply says nothing at $u = v$, and $\int_u^u f := 0$ is what is
written there. It is also unconditional: no hypothesis on $f$ beyond being
defined at $u$ is asked for, since the case $u = v$ never refers to a partition.

### The two consequences used throughout the page

**Antisymmetry, for every pair.** For all reals $u, v$ with $f$ integrable
between them,

$$\int_u^v f \;=\; -\int_v^u f .$$

Indeed if $u < v$ then $v > u$ and the third clause reads
$\int_v^u f = -\int_u^v f$, which rearranges to the display; if $u = v$ both
sides are $0$; and if $u > v$ the third clause is the display itself.

**Absolute values agree.** Consequently
$\bigl|\int_u^v f\bigr| = \bigl|\int_v^u f\bigr|$ for every such pair.

**An obligation recorded here and discharged elsewhere.** With this convention
the additivity identity

$$\int_u^v f \;+\; \int_v^w f \;=\; \int_u^w f$$

holds for **every** arrangement of $u, v, w$ in an interval on which $f$ is
integrable, not only for $u < v < w$. That is a theorem and not part of this
definition; it is proved as the last clause of
[[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]], and nothing on this page uses it before it
is proved there.

## Remarks

- **This is notation, and it is a real notation.** Without it the substitution
  theorem could not be stated with the limits $\varphi(c)$ and $\varphi(d)$ in
  the order the map produces them, since a differentiable $\varphi$ need be
  neither injective nor monotone; and the integral function $x \mapsto \int_a^x f$
  would be undefined at $x = a$.

- **One published inequality is not orientation-invariant, and that is a trap.**
  The estimate $\bigl|\int_u^v f\bigr| \le \int_u^v |f|$ is guaranteed only
  for $u \le v$: at $u > v$ the right-hand side is $-\int_v^u |f| \le 0$ while
  the left-hand side is $\ge 0$, so the inequality fails whenever
  $\int_v^u |f| > 0$. The form valid for every pair is
  $\bigl|\int_u^v f\bigr| \le \bigl|\int_u^v |f|\bigr|$, and this is stated where
  it is proved ([[cor-integrability-of-absolute-values-products-and-lattice-operations]]).

- **Integrability is a property of the unordered pair.** By construction, $f$ is
  integrable between $u$ and $v$ if and only if it is integrable between $v$ and
  $u$, since both refer to the same closed interval; only the sign of the value
  remembers the order.

## Definition

**Standing hypothesis for this page.** Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete
ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]),
$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers and **contains $0$**
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[def-nat-order]]), $\iota : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$
is the canonical natural ([[def-canonical-natural]]), and $a, b$ are reals with

$$a \;<\; b .$$

Intervals and their lengths are those of [[def-interval]]; finite sums are those
of [[def-finite-sum]], indexed as $\sum_{i<n}$ over $i \in \mathbb{N}$.

### Partitions

A **partition of $[a,b]$** is a pair $P = (n, t)$ consisting of a natural number
$n \ge 1$ and a sequence $t : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-sequence]]) with

$$t_0 = a, \qquad t_i < t_{i+1} \ \text{ for every } i < n, \qquad t_k = b \ \text{ for every } k \ge n .$$

The tail convention on the third clause is bookkeeping only: it makes $t$ a
genuine sequence, so that the finite-sum laws of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] apply to
it verbatim, and it costs nothing because no index above $n$ is ever read. The
first two clauses say exactly that

$$a \;=\; t_0 \;<\; t_1 \;<\; \dots \;<\; t_n \;=\; b ,$$

the last equality because $t_n = b$ by the third clause. In particular
$i \mapsto t_i$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on
$\{\, i \in \mathbb{N} : i \le n \,\}$ ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]),
and $a \le t_i \le b$ for every $i \le n$.

The **point set** of $P$ is the finite set

$$\operatorname{pts}(P) \;:=\; \{\, t_i \ : \ i \le n \,\} \;\subseteq\; [a,b], \qquad a, b \in \operatorname{pts}(P) .$$

The **subintervals** of $P$ are

$$I_i \;:=\; [\,t_i,\ t_{i+1}\,] \qquad (i < n),$$

and their **lengths** are $\Delta_i := t_{i+1} - t_i$. Each $\Delta_i > 0$, so
each $I_i$ is a nondegenerate closed bounded interval ([[def-interval]]). There
are $n$ of them and they are indexed from $i = 0$, not from $i = 1$: the first
subinterval is $[t_0, t_1] = [a, t_1]$.

**The lengths sum to $b - a$.** By the telescoping law, clause 5 of
[[lem-finite-sum-laws]],

$$\sum_{i<n} \Delta_i \;=\; \sum_{i<n} (t_{i+1} - t_i) \;=\; t_n - t_0 \;=\; b - a .$$

**The mesh.** The set $\{\, \Delta_i : i < n \,\}$ is a nonempty finite set of
reals, nonempty because $n \ge 1$, so it has a maximum
([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]). The **mesh** of $P$ is

$$\|P\| \;:=\; \max\{\, \Delta_i \ : \ i < n \,\} \;>\; 0 ,$$

and $\Delta_i \le \|P\|$ for every $i < n$.

**The uniform partition.** For a natural $N \ge 1$, the **uniform partition of
$[a,b]$ into $N$ parts** is $U_N := (N, t)$ with

$$t_i \;:=\; a + \iota(i)\,\frac{b-a}{\iota(N)} \quad (i \le N), \qquad t_k := b \quad (k \ge N).$$

This is a partition: $t_0 = a$; $t_N = a + (b-a) = b$; and $t_{i+1} - t_i =
(b-a)/\iota(N) > 0$ for $i < N$, because $\iota(N) > 0$ and $\iota(i+1) =
\iota(i) + 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[def-canonical-natural]]). Its
subinterval lengths are all equal to $(b-a)/\iota(N)$, so

$$\|U_N\| \;=\; \frac{b-a}{\iota(N)} .$$

### A partition is determined by its point set

**Claim.** If $P = (n,t)$ and $P' = (n', t')$ are partitions of $[a,b]$ with
$\operatorname{pts}(P) = \operatorname{pts}(P')$, then $n = n'$ and $t_i = t'_i$
for every $i \le n$.

*Proof.* First, $t_i = t'_i$ for every $i \le \min\{n,n'\}$, by induction on $i$
([[thm-induction-principle]]). For $i = 0$ both equal $a$. Suppose $t_j = t'_j$
for all $j \le i$ and $i + 1 \le \min\{n,n'\}$. The set
$S := \{\, x \in \operatorname{pts}(P) : x > t_i \,\}$ has $t_{i+1}$ as its least
element: $t_{i+1} \in S$, and any $x \in S$ is $t_j$ for some $j \le n$ with
$t_j > t_i$, which forces $j > i$ because $t$ is increasing on indices $\le n$,
hence $j \ge i+1$ and $x = t_j \ge t_{i+1}$. The same argument in $P'$ makes
$t'_{i+1}$ the least element of
$\{\, x \in \operatorname{pts}(P') : x > t'_i \,\}$, which is the same set $S$,
since the point sets agree and $t'_i = t_i$. A set has at most one least element
([[def-max-min]]), so $t_{i+1} = t'_{i+1}$.

Second, $n = n'$. If $n < n'$ then $t'_n = t_n = b$ by the previous paragraph,
while $t'_n < t'_{n'} = b$ because $t'$ is increasing on indices $\le n'$ and
$n < n'$; that is impossible. Exchanging the roles of $P$ and $P'$ rules out
$n' < n$. $\square$

So the map $P \mapsto \operatorname{pts}(P)$ is injective, and a partition may be
named by its point set whenever one is exhibited.

### Inserting a point

Let $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ and let $c \in [a,b]$. Define a
partition $P + c$ of $[a,b]$ as follows.

- If $c \in \operatorname{pts}(P)$, put $P + c := P$.
- Otherwise $c \ne a$ and $c \ne b$, so $a < c < b$. The set
  $T := \{\, t_i : i \le n \text{ and } t_i < c \,\}$ is a nonempty finite set of
  reals, nonempty because $t_0 = a < c$, so it has a maximum
  ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]); let $i_0 \le n$ be the unique index with
  $t_{i_0} = \max T$, unique because $t$ is injective on indices $\le n$. Then
  $i_0 < n$, since $t_n = b > c$ puts $t_n \notin T$; and
  $$t_{i_0} \;<\; c \;<\; t_{i_0+1},$$
  the right inequality because $t_{i_0+1} \ne c$ (as $c \notin \operatorname{pts}(P)$)
  and $t_{i_0+1} < c$ would put $t_{i_0+1} \in T$ with $t_{i_0+1} > t_{i_0} = \max T$.
  Put $P + c := (n+1, s)$ with
  $$s_i := t_i \ (i \le i_0), \qquad s_{i_0+1} := c, \qquad s_i := t_{i-1} \ (i_0 + 2 \le i \le n+1), \qquad s_k := b \ (k \ge n+1).$$

In both cases $P + c$ is a partition of $[a,b]$ and

$$\operatorname{pts}(P + c) \;=\; \operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \{c\}, \qquad \|P+c\| \;\le\; \|P\| .$$

The displayed identity is immediate from the two cases. For the mesh: in the
first case nothing changes; in the second the list of subinterval lengths of
$P + c$ is that of $P$ with $\Delta_{i_0}$ replaced by the two numbers
$c - t_{i_0}$ and $t_{i_0+1} - c$, each of which is smaller than
$\Delta_{i_0} = (c - t_{i_0}) + (t_{i_0+1} - c)$ because the other is positive.
So every length of $P + c$ is at most a length of $P$, and the maximum cannot
increase. Finally the index count grows by exactly $1$ in the second case and
not at all in the first.

### Refinement and the common refinement

$P'$ **refines** $P$, and is a **refinement** of $P$, when

$$\operatorname{pts}(P) \;\subseteq\; \operatorname{pts}(P') .$$

Let $P = (n,t)$ and $Q = (m,s)$ be partitions of $[a,b]$. Applying the recursion
theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) to the set $\mathbb{N} \times \mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$,
where $\mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$ is the set of partitions of $[a,b]$, with starting
element $(0, P)$ and the map $(j, R) \mapsto (j+1,\ R + s_j)$ — legitimate
because $s_j \in [a,b]$ for every $j \in \mathbb{N}$ — gives a unique family
$(R_j)_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ of partitions with $R_0 = P$ and $R_{j+1} = R_j + s_j$.
The **common refinement** of $P$ and $Q$ is

$$P \vee Q \;:=\; R_{m+1} .$$

**Its point set is the union.** By induction on $j$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]),
$\operatorname{pts}(R_j) = \operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \{\, s_l : l < j \,\}$;
taking $j = m+1$ gives

$$\operatorname{pts}(P \vee Q) \;=\; \operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \operatorname{pts}(Q).$$

Hence $P \vee Q$ refines both $P$ and $Q$; by the uniqueness claim above it is
the **only** partition with that point set, so $P \vee Q = Q \vee P$, and

$$P' \text{ refines } P \quad \Longrightarrow \quad P \vee P' = P' ,$$

since then $\operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \operatorname{pts}(P') =
\operatorname{pts}(P')$.

**Two size bounds, both used later.** Writing $n_R$ for the first component of a
partition $R$:

$$\|P \vee Q\| \;\le\; \|P\|, \qquad n_{P \vee Q} \;\le\; n_P + n_Q - 1 .$$

The first is the mesh bound above applied $m+1$ times. For the second, each
insertion raises the index count by at most $1$, and the two insertions of
$s_0 = a$ and $s_m = b$ raise it by $0$, since $a$ and $b$ already lie in
$\operatorname{pts}(P)$ and hence in $\operatorname{pts}(R_j)$ for every $j$; so
at most $m - 1$ of the $m+1$ insertions increase it.

### The index map of a refinement

Let $P' = (n',t')$ refine $P = (n,t)$. For each $i \le n$ the point $t_i$ lies in
$\operatorname{pts}(P')$, so there is exactly one $\varphi(i) \le n'$ with
$t'_{\varphi(i)} = t_i$, uniqueness because $t'$ is injective on indices $\le n'$.
The resulting map $\varphi$ satisfies

$$\varphi(0) = 0, \qquad \varphi(n) = n', \qquad \varphi(i) < \varphi(i+1) \ \ (i < n),$$

the first two because $t'_0 = a = t_0$ and $t'_{n'} = b = t_n$ together with
injectivity, and the third because $t_i < t_{i+1}$ and $t'$ is increasing on
indices $\le n'$. In particular $n \le n'$. Moreover, for $i < n$ and
$\varphi(i) \le j < \varphi(i+1)$,

$$I'_j \;=\; [\,t'_j,\ t'_{j+1}\,] \;\subseteq\; [\,t_i,\ t_{i+1}\,] \;=\; I_i ,$$

because $t_i = t'_{\varphi(i)} \le t'_j$ and $t'_{j+1} \le t'_{\varphi(i+1)} = t_{i+1}$.

**The blocks are counted by telescoping.** By clause 5 of
[[lem-finite-sum-laws]],
$\sum_{i<n}\big(\varphi(i+1) - \varphi(i)\big) = \varphi(n) - \varphi(0) = n'$,
so, subtracting $\sum_{i<n} 1 = n$,

$$\sum_{i<n} \big(\varphi(i+1) - \varphi(i) - 1\big) \;=\; n' - n ,$$

a sum of $n$ nonnegative integers, one for each block, which vanishes exactly at
the blocks consisting of a single index. This identity is the whole content of
the quantitative bound in [[lem-refinement-inequalities]], and it is also why
$n \le n'$.

Finally, the lengths inside a block sum to the length of the block:

$$\sum_{j = \varphi(i)}^{\varphi(i+1)-1} \Delta'_j \;=\; t'_{\varphi(i+1)} - t'_{\varphi(i)} \;=\; t_{i+1} - t_i \;=\; \Delta_i \qquad (i < n),$$

again by telescoping, applied to the sequence $l \mapsto t'_{\varphi(i)+l}$ and
read through the index-shift convention of [[def-finite-sum]].

## Remarks

- **Why $a < b$ is a standing hypothesis and not a case.** With $a = b$ the
  displayed chain $a = t_0 < \dots < t_n = b$ is unsatisfiable for $n \ge 1$, and
  admitting $n = 0$ would give a partition with no subintervals, an empty mesh
  set and no maximum. Every statement on this page is about a nondegenerate
  closed bounded interval, and the convention $\int_a^a f := 0$ is not adopted
  here because nothing below needs it.

- **The subintervals overlap at their shared endpoints, and that is harmless.**
  $I_i \cap I_{i+1} = \{t_{i+1}\}$, so the union $\bigcup_{i<n} I_i = [a,b]$ is
  not disjoint. Every quantity attached to a partition below is a sum over $i<n$
  of a number times $\Delta_i$, and a single point contributes length $0$, so no
  statement on this page is sensitive to the double counting of the $n-1$
  interior points.

- **Refinement is a relation between point sets, not between lists.** Defining it
  as "$P'$ is obtained from $P$ by inserting points" would be the same relation,
  by the uniqueness claim above, but it would make every proof carry an
  insertion order. The index map $\varphi$ recovers the list-level picture when
  it is wanted, and it is what [[lem-refinement-inequalities]] actually uses.

## Statement

Let $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be sequences of reals, let
$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, and let $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, with finite sums and
finite products as in [[def-finite-sum]]. Then:

1. **Additivity.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k$.
2. **Scaling.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k$; in particular $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda = n\lambda$, where $n$ denotes the canonical natural $\iota(n) \in \mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).
3. **Splitting.** If $m \le n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k$, and $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n} a_k = \Big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k\Big)$.
4. **Monotonicity.** If $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$. In particular, if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, every single term satisfies $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$ for $j < n$, and $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ forces $a_k = 0$ for every $k < n$.
5. **Telescoping.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}\big(c_{k+1} - c_k\big) = c_n - c_0$.
6. **Products.** $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k) = \Big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\Big)$; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, and if $a_k > 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k > 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\lambda$, and naturals $m, n$. Write $\Sigma_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\Pi_n = \prod_{k<n} a_k$.

[L1] Recursion clauses ([[def-finite-sum]]): $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ and $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n$; $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1$ and $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) \cdot a_n$; and $\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k = \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j}$ for $m \le n$, likewise for products.

[L2] Field axioms: addition and multiplication are associative and commutative, $0$ and $1$ are the identities, $x - x = 0$, and multiplication distributes over addition ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]); and $0 \cdot x = 0$, which is not an axiom but a lemma ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

[L3] Induction principle: a property holding at $0$ and inherited by successors holds at every natural ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L4] Adding inequalities: $x \le y$ and $u \le v$ imply $x + u \le y + v$. [[lem-of-add-order]] states the STRICT forms and only those ($x < y \Rightarrow x + c < y + c$, and $x < y$ with $u < v$ giving $x + u < y + v$); the nonstrict form used throughout below is those two together with the cases $x = y$ and $u = v$, which are settled by trichotomy, the order being total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] The canonical embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a field homomorphism, so $\iota(0) = 0$ and $\iota(n+1) = \iota(n) + 1$, and $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L6] Sign rules: a product of two positives is positive ([[lem-of-sign-rules]], claim 1), and a product of two nonnegatives is nonnegative, since a factor equal to $0$ makes the product $0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]) and otherwise both factors are positive; and $1 > 0$, which is proved in [[cor-of-one-positive]] and stated by none of the items named above.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 0$: every claim holds at $n = 0$, since both sides of claim 1 are $0 = 0 + 0$, both sides of claim 2 are $0 = \lambda \cdot 0$ and $0 = \iota(0)\lambda$, claim 4 reads $0 \le 0$ with no term to bound and the hypothesis $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ giving nothing to prove, claim 5 reads $0 = c_0 - c_0$, and claim 6 reads $1 = 1 \cdot 1$ with $1 > 0$. [base, L1, L2, L5, L6]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for this $n$ and for all sequences $a, b, c$ and all $\lambda$. [ih]

1.3 Splitting, claim 3, by a separate induction on the number of trailing terms $d = n - m$ with $m$ fixed: for $d = 0$ the claim reads $\sum_{k<m} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + 0$ and $\prod_{k<m} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\big) \cdot 1$, which hold; and if $\sum_{k<m+d} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d} a_{m+j}$, then $\sum_{k<m+d+1} a_k = \sum_{k<m+d} a_k + a_{m+d} = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \big(\sum_{j<d} a_{m+j} + a_{m+d}\big) = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d+1} a_{m+j}$ by associativity, and identically for products with $1$ in place of $0$ and multiplication in place of addition, so induction on $d$ gives claim 3 for every $m \le n$. [L1, L2, L3]

2.1 Additivity at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k\big) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) + \big(\sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n\big) = \sum_{k<n+1} a_k + \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$, using the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of addition. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Scaling at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda a_k = \sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda\big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) = \lambda \sum_{k<n+1} a_k$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and distributivity; taking $a_k = 1$ for all $k$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda = \sum_{k<n} \lambda + \lambda = \iota(n)\lambda + \lambda = (\iota(n) + 1)\lambda = \iota(n+1)\lambda$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L5]

2.3 Monotonicity at $n+1$: assume $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n+1$; then $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$, so the hypothesis gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$, and adding the inequality $a_n \le b_n$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n \le \sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n = \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$. [step 1.2, L1, L4]

2.4 Telescoping at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(c_{k+1} - c_k) = \sum_{k<n}(c_{k+1} - c_k) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = (c_n - c_0) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = c_{n+1} - c_0$, by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and the field identities. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.5 Products at $n+1$: $\prod_{k<n+1}(a_k b_k) = \big(\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k)\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n+1} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n+1} b_k\big)$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of multiplication; and if every $a_k \ge 0$ for $k < n+1$ then $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) a_n$ is a product of two nonnegatives, hence nonnegative, with the same argument giving positivity from positivity since $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1 > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L6]

3.1 Consequences of monotonicity, completing claim 4: monotonicity itself holds at every $n$, by the induction principle applied to the base case of step 1.1 and the successor step 2.3, so it is available for an arbitrary $n$ in what follows; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then comparing with the zero sequence gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge \sum_{k<n} 0 = 0$; for $j < n$ splitting at $j$ and then at $j+1$ writes $\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<j} a_k + a_j + \sum_{k=j+1}^{n-1} a_k$ with the first and third summands $\ge 0$, so $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$; and if moreover $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ then $0 \le a_j \le 0$ for every $j < n$, so $a_j = 0$. [step 1.1, step 2.3, step 1.3, L3, L4, L2]

4.1 By the induction principle claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and claim 3 was proved in step 1.3 with its consequences in step 3.1, so all six laws hold. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, step 2.5, step 1.3, step 3.1, L3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfy

$$m \;\le\; f(x) \;\le\; M \qquad \text{for every } x \in [a,b],$$

with $m, M$ real. Then $f$ is bounded ([[def-bounded-set]]), so its Darboux sums
and integrals are defined ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-darboux-integral]]), and
for **every** partition $P$ of $[a,b]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]])

$$m(b-a) \;\le\; L(f,P) \;\le\; \underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; U(f,P) \;\le\; M(b-a) .$$

In particular, taking $f$ to be the constant function with value $c$:

$$\int_a^b c \;=\; c\,(b-a) ,$$

the constant function being integrable, with $L(f,P) = U(f,P) = c(b-a)$ for
every partition $P$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, reals $m \le M$, and $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ with $m \le f(x) \le M$ for every $x \in [a,b]$. Let $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$, with subintervals $I_i$ and lengths $\Delta_i$ for $i < n$.

[L1] $\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = b - a$, every $\Delta_i > 0$, and $n \ge 1$; each $I_i$ is a nonempty subset of $[a,b]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-interval]]).

[L2] $m_i = \inf f[I_i]$ and $M_i = \sup f[I_i]$ exist, $L(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}m_i\Delta_i$ and $U(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}M_i\Delta_i$, and $m_i \le f(x) \le M_i$ for $x \in I_i$ ([[def-darboux-sums]]).

[L3] $L(f,P) \le \underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,P)$ for every partition $P$; $f$ is integrable exactly when the two integrals are equal, and then $\int_a^b f$ is their common value ([[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L4] An infimum is the greatest lower bound and a supremum the least upper bound; a set with a single element has that element as both ([[def-infimum]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L5] Finite sums: scaling, monotonicity in the terms, and $\sum_{i<n}\lambda\,\Delta_i = \lambda\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L6] Ordered-field arithmetic: multiplying an inequality by a positive quantity preserves it, adding a constant preserves it, and the order is transitive; $|x| \le \max\{|m|,|M|\}$ whenever $m \le x \le M$ ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $f$ is bounded: $|f(x)| \le \max\{|m|,|M|\}$ for every $x \in [a,b]$ by [L6], so the Darboux sums and integrals of [L2] and [L3] are defined. [given, L6]

1.2 For every $i < n$: $m$ is a lower bound of $f[I_i]$ and $M$ an upper bound, since $I_i \subseteq [a,b]$; the set $f[I_i]$ is nonempty by [L1]. Hence $m \le m_i$ and $M_i \le M$ by [L4]. [given, L1, L2, L4]

1.3 **The constant case, treated on its own.** Suppose in addition that $f$ is the constant function with value $c$, that is $f(x) = c$ for every $x \in [a,b]$; the general argument below does not use this supposition. Then $f[I_i] = \{c\}$ for every $i < n$ by [L1], so $m_i = M_i = c$ by [L4], and $L(f,P) = U(f,P) = \sum_{i<n} c\,\Delta_i = c(b-a)$ by [L5] and [L1]. [L1, L2, L4, L5]

2.1 $L(f,P) \ge m(b-a)$: by step 1.2 and $\Delta_i > 0$ one has $m_i\Delta_i \ge m\Delta_i$ for every $i < n$, so monotonicity and scaling in [L5] give $L(f,P) \ge \sum_{i<n} m\,\Delta_i = m\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = m(b-a)$ by [L1]. [step 1.2, L1, L5, L6]

2.2 $U(f,P) \le M(b-a)$: the same argument with $M_i \le M$ gives $U(f,P) \le \sum_{i<n}M\,\Delta_i = M(b-a)$. [step 1.2, L1, L5, L6]

3.1 Combining steps 2.1 and 2.2 with the chain of [L3] gives the displayed five-term inequality for every partition $P$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L3]

4.1 Hence, still under the supposition of step 1.3 that $f$ is constant with value $c$, the set of lower sums and the set of upper sums are both $\{c(b-a)\}$, so $\underline{\int_a^b} f = \overline{\int_a^b} f = c(b-a)$ by [L4], $f$ is integrable, and $\int_a^b c = c(b-a)$ by [L3]. [step 1.3, L3, L4] ∎

## Remarks

- **The five-term chain is the only estimate most of this page needs.** Every integrability proof below produces one partition and controls $U(f,P) - L(f,P)$; the chain then locates both integrals inside an interval of that length, and [[thm-riemann-criterion]] turns the observation into an equivalence.

- **The bounds are sharp, but equality does not characterize constants.** Constant functions show that neither outer coefficient can be improved. Nonconstant functions can also attain equality: for the Dirichlet indicator on $[0,1]$, every partition has $L(f,P) = 0$ and $U(f,P) = 1$, so both outer bounds are equalities.

- **Nonnegativity, as a special case.** If $f \ge 0$ on $[a,b]$ then $m$ may be taken to be $0$, so $\int_a^b f \ge 0$ whenever the integral exists. A nonnegative integrand with vanishing integral need not vanish, however; that is [[fs-nonnegative-integrable-with-zero-integral-vanishes]].

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded, say
$|f(x)| \le M$ for every $x \in [a,b]$ with $M \ge 0$ real
([[def-bounded-set]]). Darboux sums are those of [[def-darboux-sums]] and
partitions those of [[def-partition-and-refinement]]. Then:

1. **Refinement.** If $P' = (n',t')$ refines $P = (n,t)$ then
   $$L(f,P) \;\le\; L(f,P') \;\le\; U(f,P') \;\le\; U(f,P).$$
2. **Every lower sum is at most every upper sum.** For arbitrary partitions $P$
   and $Q$ of $[a,b]$,
   $$L(f,P) \;\le\; U(f,Q).$$
3. **Quantitative form.** If $P' = (n',t')$ refines $P = (n,t)$ then
   $$0 \;\le\; U(f,P) - U(f,P') \;\le\; 2M\,(n' - n)\,\|P\|, \qquad 0 \;\le\; L(f,P') - L(f,P) \;\le\; 2M\,(n' - n)\,\|P\| .$$

**Notation.** In claim 3 the natural number $n' - n$ multiplies a real, and as in
clause 2 of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] it stands there for its canonical natural
$\iota(n'-n) \in \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-canonical-natural]]); $\iota$ is additive and
nondecreasing on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). The same
abbreviation is used throughout the proof.

Claims 1 and 2 are what make [[def-darboux-integral]] well posed. Claim 3 is the
extra information that a refinement changes the sums by an amount controlled by
the mesh of the **coarse** partition and by how many points were added; it is
what [[thm-darboux-equals-riemann]] needs and nothing else on this page uses it.
Here $n' - n \ge 0$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]), so the right-hand bounds
are nonnegative.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, a bounded $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ with $|f(x)| \le M$ for all $x \in [a,b]$ and $M \ge 0$ real, and partitions $P = (n,t)$ and $P' = (n',t')$ of $[a,b]$ with $P'$ refining $P$.

[L1] A refinement carries an index map $\varphi$ with $\varphi(0) = 0$, $\varphi(n) = n'$ and $\varphi(i) < \varphi(i+1)$ for $i < n$; hence $\varphi(k) \ge k$ for $k \le n$ and $n \le n'$. For $i < n$ and $\varphi(i) \le j < \varphi(i+1)$ one has $I'_j \subseteq I_i$, and $\sum_{j=\varphi(i)}^{\varphi(i+1)-1}\Delta'_j = \Delta_i$. Every $\Delta_i$ satisfies $0 < \Delta_i \le \|P\|$, and $\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = b - a$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L2] For any partitions $R, S$ of $[a,b]$ the common refinement $R \vee S$ refines both ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L3] With $m_i = \inf f[I_i]$ and $M_i = \sup f[I_i]$: $-M \le m_i \le f(x) \le M_i \le M$ for $x \in I_i$, $L(f,P) = \sum_{i<n} m_i\Delta_i$, $U(f,P) = \sum_{i<n} M_i\Delta_i$, and $L(f,R) \le U(f,R)$ for every partition $R$ ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-interval]]).

[L4] If $\varnothing \ne S \subseteq T \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $T$ is bounded above then $\sup S \le \sup T$ ([[lem-sup-monotone]]); dually, if $T$ is bounded below then $\inf S \ge \inf T$, since $\inf T$ is a lower bound of $T$ and hence of $S$, and $\inf S$ is the greatest lower bound of $S$ ([[def-infimum]], [[thm-infimum-property]]).

[L5] Finite sums: splitting $\sum_{j<q} c_j = \sum_{j<p} c_j + \sum_{j=p}^{q-1} c_j$ for $p \le q$, additivity, scaling, monotonicity in the terms, and telescoping ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L6] Induction on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L7] Ordered-field arithmetic: adding a constant and multiplying by a nonnegative quantity preserve an inequality, and the order is total and transitive ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[cor-of-one-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

[L8] A natural number multiplying a real means its canonical natural $\iota(\cdot)$; $\iota(0) = 0$, $\iota(p+q) = \iota(p)+\iota(q)$, $\iota(p) \ge 0$, and $p \le q$ implies $\iota(p) \le \iota(q)$ ([[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Fix the index map $\varphi$ of [L1] and, for $k \le n$, put $A_k := \sum_{j<\varphi(k)} M'_j\Delta'_j$, $B_k := \sum_{i<k} M_i\Delta_i$, $A^{-}_k := \sum_{j<\varphi(k)} m'_j\Delta'_j$ and $B^{-}_k := \sum_{i<k} m_i\Delta_i$; let $Q(k)$ be the conjunction $B_k - 2M\|P\|(\varphi(k)-k) \le A_k \le B_k$ and $B^{-}_k \le A^{-}_k \le B^{-}_k + 2M\|P\|(\varphi(k)-k)$. The proof is an induction on $k$ using [L6]. [given, L1, L6, construct]

1.2 **Base, $k = 0$.** All four sums are empty, hence $0$, and $\varphi(0) - 0 = 0$, so $Q(0)$ reads $0 \le 0 \le 0$ twice. [base, L1, L5]

1.3 **Induction hypothesis.** Fix $k < n$ and assume $Q(k)$. [ih, given]

2.1 Put $\beta := \sum_{j=\varphi(k)}^{\varphi(k+1)-1} M'_j\Delta'_j$ and $\gamma := \sum_{j=\varphi(k)}^{\varphi(k+1)-1} m'_j\Delta'_j$. For $\varphi(k) \le j < \varphi(k+1)$ one has $I'_j \subseteq I_k$, hence $f[I'_j] \subseteq f[I_k]$, hence $m_k \le m'_j \le M'_j \le M_k$ by [L4] and [L3]; also $|M'_j| \le M$ and $|m'_j| \le M$ by [L3]. [step 1.1, L1, L3, L4]

3.1 Since $\Delta'_j > 0$ and the lengths in the block sum to $\Delta_k$ by [L1], monotonicity and scaling of finite sums ([L5]) give $m_k\Delta_k \le \gamma \le \beta \le M_k\Delta_k$ and $-M\Delta_k \le \gamma \le \beta \le M\Delta_k$. [step 2.1, L1, L5, L7]

4.1 Both $M_k\Delta_k - \beta$ and $\gamma - m_k\Delta_k$ lie in $[\,0,\ 2M\|P\|(\varphi(k+1)-\varphi(k)-1)\,]$. Nonnegativity is step 3.1. If $\varphi(k+1) = \varphi(k)+1$ the block is the single index $j = \varphi(k)$, and then $I'_j = I_k$ by [L1], so $M'_j = M_k$, $m'_j = m_k$, $\Delta'_j = \Delta_k$ and both quantities are $0$. Otherwise $\varphi(k+1) - \varphi(k) - 1 \ge 1$, and by step 3.1 and [L3] each quantity is at most $M\Delta_k + M\Delta_k = 2M\Delta_k \le 2M\|P\|$, hence at most $2M\|P\|(\varphi(k+1)-\varphi(k)-1)$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L1, L3, L5, L7, L8]

5.1 **The upper half of $Q(k+1)$.** By the splitting law [L5], $A_{k+1} = A_k + \beta$ and $B_{k+1} = B_k + M_k\Delta_k$. From step 1.3 and step 3.1, $A_{k+1} \le B_k + M_k\Delta_k = B_{k+1}$; and from step 1.3 and step 4.1, $A_{k+1} \ge B_k - 2M\|P\|(\varphi(k)-k) + M_k\Delta_k - 2M\|P\|(\varphi(k+1)-\varphi(k)-1) = B_{k+1} - 2M\|P\|(\varphi(k+1)-(k+1))$. [step 1.3, step 3.1, step 4.1, L5, L7, L8]

5.2 **The lower half of $Q(k+1)$.** Likewise $A^{-}_{k+1} = A^{-}_k + \gamma$ and $B^{-}_{k+1} = B^{-}_k + m_k\Delta_k$, so step 1.3 with step 3.1 gives $A^{-}_{k+1} \ge B^{-}_{k+1}$, and step 1.3 with step 4.1 gives $A^{-}_{k+1} \le B^{-}_k + 2M\|P\|(\varphi(k)-k) + m_k\Delta_k + 2M\|P\|(\varphi(k+1)-\varphi(k)-1) = B^{-}_{k+1} + 2M\|P\|(\varphi(k+1)-(k+1))$. So $Q(k+1)$ holds. [step 1.3, step 3.1, step 4.1, L5, L7, L8]

6.1 By [L6] with steps 1.2, 1.3, 5.1 and 5.2, $Q(k)$ holds for every $k \le n$. Taking $k = n$ and using $\varphi(n) = n'$ from [L1]: $A_n = U(f,P')$, $B_n = U(f,P)$, $A^{-}_n = L(f,P')$ and $B^{-}_n = L(f,P)$, so $U(f,P) - 2M\|P\|(n'-n) \le U(f,P') \le U(f,P)$ and $L(f,P) \le L(f,P') \le L(f,P) + 2M\|P\|(n'-n)$. With $L(f,P') \le U(f,P')$ from [L3] this is claim 1, and it is claim 3. [step 1.2, step 1.3, step 5.1, step 5.2, L1, L3, L6, L8]

7.1 **Claim 2.** Let $P$ and $Q$ be arbitrary partitions of $[a,b]$ and let $R := P \vee Q$, which refines both by [L2]. Applying step 6.1 to the pair $(P,R)$ and to the pair $(Q,R)$ gives $L(f,P) \le L(f,R) \le U(f,R) \le U(f,Q)$, the middle inequality by [L3]. All three claims are now established, the first and third in step 6.1 from the completed induction and the second here. [step 6.1, L2, L3, L6, discharge-induction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the hypothesis $|f| \le M$ is used, and where it is not.** Claims 1 and 2 need only that $f$ is bounded, so that the Darboux sums exist at all; the particular bound $M$ enters only in claim 3, through step 4.1, and the factor $2M$ there is exactly the largest possible value of $M_k - m_k$ ([[def-darboux-sums]]).

- **The mesh in claim 3 is that of the coarse partition.** It has to be: the refinement $P'$ may have very short subintervals, and what the estimate measures is how much a single one of $P$'s subintervals can be improved by being cut up. That is why [[thm-darboux-equals-riemann]] can fix a partition $P_0$ once and then let $P$ range over all partitions of small mesh.

- **The count $n' - n$ is not a count of new points in disguise.** It is the difference of the two index counts, and by the telescoping identity of [[def-partition-and-refinement]] it equals the total amount by which the blocks of $\varphi$ exceed length one. That is the form the proof uses, and it needs no notion of the cardinality of $\operatorname{pts}(P') \setminus \operatorname{pts}(P)$.

## Statement

For $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ write $-S := \{-s : s \in S\}$. Then $-(-S) = S$,
and $S$ is nonempty if and only if $-S$ is nonempty. Moreover, for all
$u, \ell \in \mathbb{R}$:

1. $u$ is an upper bound of $S$ if and only if $-u$ is a lower bound of $-S$;
2. $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$ if and only if $-\ell$ is an upper bound of $-S$.

Consequently $S$ is bounded above if and only if $-S$ is bounded below, $S$ is
bounded below if and only if $-S$ is bounded above, and $S$ is bounded if and
only if $-S$ is bounded ([[def-bounded-set]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, its reflection $-S = \{-s : s \in S\}$, and elements $u, \ell \in \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] $\mathbb{R}$ is a complete ordered field, in particular an ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), and in an ordered field the order is *defined* by the positive cone $P$: $x < y$ means exactly $y - x \in P$, and $x \le y$ means $x < y$ or $x = y$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Upper bound, lower bound, bounded above, bounded below and bounded have their meanings from [[def-bounded-set]]: $u$ bounds $S$ above when $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$, and $\ell$ bounds $S$ below when $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.

[L3] Field arithmetic. Additive inverses are unique ([[lem-of-inverse-unique]]), and $(-x) + x = 0$ by the inverse axiom, so $x$ is the additive inverse of $-x$, that is $-(-x) = x$. Addition is commutative and $y - x$ abbreviates $y + (-x)$ ([[def-field]]), so $y - x = y + (-x) = (-x) + y = (-x) + (-(-y)) = (-x) - (-y)$ for all $x, y$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For all $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$ the field identity $y - x = (-x) - (-y)$ holds, and $-(-x) = x$. [L3, algebra]

1.2 The map $s \mapsto -s$ sends $S$ onto $-S$ and $-S$ onto $-(-S)$, and since $-(-s) = s$ it is a bijection of $S$ with $-S$ whose inverse is itself; hence $-(-S) = S$, and $S$ is nonempty exactly when $-S$ is nonempty. [L3, algebra]

2.1 For all $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$: $x < y$ holds exactly when $y - x$ is positive, which by 1.1 is exactly when $(-x) - (-y)$ is positive, which is exactly $-y < -x$; and $x = y$ holds exactly when $-x = -y$; hence $x \le y$ if and only if $-y \le -x$. [step 1.1, L1]

3.1 Suppose $u$ is an upper bound of $S$. Every element of $-S$ has the form $-s$ with $s \in S$, and $s \le u$ gives $-u \le -s$; hence $-u$ is a lower bound of $-S$. [assume-hyp, step 2.1, L2]

3.2 Conversely, suppose $-u$ is a lower bound of $-S$. For $s \in S$ we have $-s \in -S$, so $-u \le -s$, and applying 2.1 to this inequality gives $s \le u$; hence $u$ is an upper bound of $S$. This together with 3.1 proves claim 1. [assume-hyp, step 2.1, L2]

3.3 Suppose $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$. For $s \in S$ we have $\ell \le s$, hence $-s \le -\ell$, and every element of $-S$ is such a $-s$; hence $-\ell$ is an upper bound of $-S$. [assume-hyp, step 2.1, L2]

3.4 Conversely, suppose $-\ell$ is an upper bound of $-S$. For $s \in S$ we have $-s \in -S$, so $-s \le -\ell$, and applying 2.1 gives $\ell \le s$; hence $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$. This together with 3.3 proves claim 2. [assume-hyp, step 2.1, L2]

4.1 Claim 1 says the upper bounds of $S$ are exactly the negatives of the lower bounds of $-S$, so $S$ is bounded above exactly when $-S$ is bounded below; claim 2 says likewise that $S$ is bounded below exactly when $-S$ is bounded above; combining the two, $S$ is bounded exactly when $-S$ is bounded, and $-(-S) = S$ with $S$ nonempty exactly when $-S$ is nonempty.

## Statement

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. If $u_1$ and $u_2$ are both least upper bounds of
$S$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), then $u_1 = u_2$. If $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$
are both greatest lower bounds of $S$ ([[def-infimum]]), then
$\ell_1 = \ell_2$.

Consequently a set has at most one supremum and at most one infimum, and the
notations $\sup S$ and $\inf S$ denote single, well-determined real numbers
whenever they exist.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ of the complete ordered field $\mathbb{R}$, together with elements $u_1, u_2, \ell_1, \ell_2 \in \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] $u$ is a least upper bound of $S$ exactly when $u$ is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le u'$ for every upper bound $u'$ of $S$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] $\ell$ is a greatest lower bound of $S$ exactly when $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$ and $\ell' \le \ell$ for every lower bound $\ell'$ of $S$ ([[def-infimum]]).

[L3] Antisymmetry of the order: for $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$, if $a \le b$ and $b \le a$ then $a = b$. This is trichotomy in the underlying ordered field, which says that exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds, so, reasoning by contradiction, $a \ne b$ would put both $a < b$ and $b < a$ in force, which trichotomy forbids ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $u_1$ and $u_2$ are both least upper bounds of $S$; in particular each of them is an upper bound of $S$ and each is $\le$ every upper bound of $S$. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.2 Assume $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ are both greatest lower bounds of $S$; in particular each of them is a lower bound of $S$ and each is $\ge$ every lower bound of $S$. [assume-hyp, L2]

2.1 Applying the leastness of $u_1$ to the upper bound $u_2$ gives $u_1 \le u_2$, and applying the leastness of $u_2$ to the upper bound $u_1$ gives $u_2 \le u_1$. [step 1.1, L1]

2.2 Applying the greatestness of $\ell_1$ to the lower bound $\ell_2$ gives $\ell_2 \le \ell_1$, and applying the greatestness of $\ell_2$ to the lower bound $\ell_1$ gives $\ell_1 \le \ell_2$. [step 1.2, L2]

3.1 By antisymmetry $u_1 = u_2$ and $\ell_1 = \ell_2$, so a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound of $S$ are each unique when they exist, which is what licenses writing $\sup S$ and $\inf S$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L3] ∎

## Statement

Let $a < b$ and $m \le M$ be reals, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]) with

$$m \;\le\; f(x) \;\le\; M \qquad \text{for every } x \in [a,b],$$

and let $\varphi : [m,M] \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $[m,M]$
([[def-continuity-real]]). Then the composite
$\varphi \circ f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is integrable on $[a,b]$.

**The order of the hypotheses is the whole content, and it does not reverse.**
What is assumed is *continuous after integrable*: the outer function is the
continuous one. Weakening the outer function to a merely integrable $\varphi$
makes the statement **false**, and the witness is on the companion page. The
remaining variant — $\varphi$ merely integrable with $f$ *continuous* — is
neither proved nor refuted anywhere on this page, and the companion page's
witness does not bear on it, its inner function being discontinuous at every
rational. Nothing here asserts anything about that variant.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and $m \le M$, an integrable $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ with values in $[m,M]$, a continuous $\varphi : [m,M] \to \mathbb{R}$, and a real $\varepsilon > 0$. Write $h := \varphi \circ f$.

[L1] Riemann's criterion: a bounded $u$ on $[a,b]$ is integrable if and only if for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a partition $P$ with $U(u,P) - L(u,P) < \eta$ ([[thm-riemann-criterion]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L2] For a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[a,b]$ and bounded $u$: $U(u,P) - L(u,P) = \sum_{i<n}\bigl(M_i(u) - m_i(u)\bigr)\Delta_i$ with $\Delta_i > 0$ and $\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = b - a$, and $M_i(u) - m_i(u) = \omega_u(I_i) = \sup\{\,|u(x)-u(y)| : x,y \in I_i\,\}$ ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-oscillation]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L3] $[m,M]$ with $m \le M$ and $[a,b]$ are closed bounded intervals, hence compact ([[thm-heine-borel-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L4] A continuous real function on a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is bounded there ([[cor-boundedness-theorem-r]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L5] Heine-Cantor: a continuous real function on a compact $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is uniformly continuous on $K$, so for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a real $\delta_0 > 0$ with $|\varphi(s)-\varphi(t)| < \eta$ for all $s,t \in K$ with $|s-t| < \delta_0$ ([[thm-heine-cantor-r]], [[def-uniform-continuity-real]]).

[L6] Finite sums: additivity, scaling and monotonicity in the terms ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], clauses 1, 2 and 4).

[L7] Ordered-field arithmetic and the absolute value: multiplying an inequality by a nonnegative quantity and adding constants preserve it, the order is total and transitive, a positive real has a positive inverse, and $|u| \le c$ follows from $-c \le u \le c$ ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]). The nonstrict forms follow from the strict ones by adjoining the case of equality.

[L8] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a real $\eta' > 0$ with $\eta' < \eta$, for instance $\eta' = \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$; and the Archimedean property in reciprocal form ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $[m,M]$ is compact, so $\varphi$ is bounded there: fix a real $K \ge 0$ with $|\varphi(s)| \le K$ for every $s \in [m,M]$. Hence $|h(x)| \le K$ for every $x \in [a,b]$ and $h$ is bounded. [given, L3, L4, choose]

1.2 By [L5] applied on the compact $[m,M]$ with $\eta := \varepsilon$, fix a real $\delta_0 > 0$ with $|\varphi(s)-\varphi(t)| < \varepsilon$ whenever $s,t \in [m,M]$ and $|s-t| < \delta_0$; then put $\delta := \min\{\delta_0 \cdot 2^{-1},\ \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}\}$, a positive real with $\delta < \delta_0$ and $\delta < \varepsilon$. [given, L3, L5, L7, L8, choose]

2.1 So $|\varphi(s)-\varphi(t)| \le \varepsilon$ whenever $s,t \in [m,M]$ satisfy $|s-t| \le \delta$, since $\delta < \delta_0$. [step 1.2, L7]

2.2 Since $\delta > 0$, so is $\delta^{2}$, and [L1] supplies a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[a,b]$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \delta^{2}$. [step 1.2, given, L1, L7, choose]

3.1 Fix $i < n$ and write $\Omega_i := M_i(f) - m_i(f) \ge 0$. If $\Omega_i \le \delta$ then any $x,y \in I_i$ have $|f(x)-f(y)| \le \Omega_i \le \delta$ with $f(x),f(y) \in [m,M]$, so $|h(x)-h(y)| \le \varepsilon$ by step 2.1, whence $M_i(h) - m_i(h) \le \varepsilon$ by [L2]. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L2, L7]

3.2 If instead $\Omega_i > \delta$ then $\Omega_i/\delta > 1$, while $M_i(h) - m_i(h) \le 2K$ always, by [L2] and step 1.1. [step 1.1, step 2.2, L2, L7]

4.1 In both cases $\bigl(M_i(h)-m_i(h)\bigr)\Delta_i \le \varepsilon\,\Delta_i + \bigl(2K/\delta\bigr)\Omega_i\Delta_i$: in the first case the second summand is nonnegative and the first alone dominates, and in the second case $(2K/\delta)\Omega_i\Delta_i \ge 2K\Delta_i$ dominates by itself. [step 3.1, step 3.2, L7]

5.1 Summing over $i < n$ with [L6] and using $\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = b-a$ and [L2] gives $U(h,P)-L(h,P) \le \varepsilon(b-a) + (2K/\delta)\bigl(U(f,P)-L(f,P)\bigr)$. [step 4.1, L2, L6, L7]

6.1 By step 2.2 the second summand is below $(2K/\delta)\delta^{2} = 2K\delta$, and $\delta < \varepsilon$ by step 1.2, so $U(h,P)-L(h,P) < \varepsilon\,(b-a+2K)$. [step 2.2, step 5.1, L7]

7.1 Let a real $\eta > 0$ be given. Running steps 1.2 to 6.1 with $\varepsilon := \eta/(b-a+2K+1)$, a positive real since $b-a+2K+1 > 0$, produces a partition $P$ with $U(h,P)-L(h,P) < \eta\,(b-a+2K)/(b-a+2K+1) < \eta$. [step 6.1, L7, L8]

8.1 As $\eta > 0$ was arbitrary and $h$ is bounded by step 1.1, [L1] makes $h = \varphi\circ f$ integrable on $[a,b]$. [step 1.1, step 7.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Step 4.1 is what replaces the usual split of the index range.** The classical proof separates the indices into a good set $G$ and a bad set $B$ and sums over each; the finite-sum toolkit used here is that of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], stated for $\sum_{i<n}$ and carrying no clause that splits a range into a subset and its complement, so the split is carried instead by a single inequality valid at *every* index, whose two summands are exactly the two contributions. The bound obtained is the same one.

- **The hypothesis $f[\,[a,b]\,] \subseteq [m,M]$ is what makes $\varphi\circ f$ defined at all**, and $m,M$ exist because an integrable $f$ is bounded ([[def-darboux-sums]]). Taking $[m,M]$ to be any interval containing the range of $f$ is legitimate and changes nothing, since a continuous function on a larger compact interval restricts to a continuous one.

- **What the theorem does not say.** It does not say that $\varphi\circ f$ is integrable when $\varphi$ is merely integrable, and it does not say that $\int_a^b \varphi\circ f$ can be computed from $\int_a^b f$. The first is refuted on the companion page. For the second, take $\varphi(t) = t^{2}$ on $[0,1]$ with $f$ the constant $1/2$ and with $g$ the indicator of $[0,1/2]$: both are integrable with integral $1/2$, while $\int_0^1 \varphi\circ f = 1/4$ and $\int_0^1 \varphi\circ g = 1/2$, so $\int_a^b \varphi\circ f$ is not a function of $\int_a^b f$.

- **Forward reference, orientation only.** The reversal refuted on the companion page is [[cex-a-composition-of-integrable-functions-that-is-not-integrable]]; nothing above depends on it.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]). Then $f$ is Darboux integrable on $[a,b]$
([[def-darboux-integral]]) **if and only if**

$$\text{for every real } \varepsilon > 0 \text{ there is a partition } P \text{ of } [a,b] \text{ with } U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$$

([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

**This is the criterion every later integrability proof on this page uses.** It
replaces a statement about a supremum and an infimum over all partitions, which
cannot be checked directly, by the exhibition of a **single** partition for each
$\varepsilon$. The criterion says nothing about the value of the integral; that
is located separately, by [[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]], between $L(f,P)$
and $U(f,P)$ for the same $P$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and a bounded $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$.

[A1] The criterion: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a partition $P$ of $[a,b]$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$.

[L1] $L(f,P) \le \underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,P)$ for every partition $P$; $\underline{\int_a^b} f = \sup \mathcal{L}$ and $\overline{\int_a^b} f = \inf \mathcal{U}$ over the nonempty sets $\mathcal{L}$ of lower sums and $\mathcal{U}$ of upper sums; $f$ is integrable exactly when the two are equal ([[def-darboux-integral]], [[def-darboux-sums]]).

[L2] $\varepsilon$-characterisation of the supremum: if $u = \sup S$ with $S$ nonempty then for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $s \in S$ with $s > u - \varepsilon$ ([[lem-sup-epsilon]]). Dually, if $\ell = \inf S$ then for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $s \in S$ with $s < \ell + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-inf-epsilon]], [[def-infimum]]).

[L3] If $P'$ refines $P$ then $L(f,P) \le L(f,P')$ and $U(f,P') \le U(f,P)$; the common refinement $P_1 \vee P_2$ refines both $P_1$ and $P_2$ ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L4] Ordered-field arithmetic: adding a constant to both sides preserves an inequality, the order is total and transitive, and $t \cdot 2^{-1} > 0$ for $t > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Write $D := \overline{\int_a^b} f - \underline{\int_a^b} f$, a real number with $D \ge 0$ by [L1]; $f$ is integrable exactly when $D = 0$. [L1]

1.2 **The criterion is sufficient.** Assume [A1] and let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. Fix a partition $P$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$. By [L1], $\underline{\int_a^b} f \ge L(f,P)$ and $\overline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,P)$, so $D \le U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$. [A1, L1, L4, choose]

1.3 **The criterion is necessary; this half of the proof is steps 1.3, 2.2 and 3.1, and its symbols are its own.** Assume $f$ is integrable and write $I$ for the common value $\underline{\int_a^b} f = \overline{\int_a^b} f$. Let a real $\eta > 0$ be given; then $\eta \cdot 2^{-1} > 0$ by [L4]. [L1, L4]

2.1 So $0 \le D < \varepsilon$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$. If $D > 0$, taking $\varepsilon := D$ gives $D < D$, which is false; hence $D = 0$ and $f$ is integrable by step 1.1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L4]

2.2 By [L2] applied to $\mathcal{L}$, whose supremum is $I$, there is a partition $P_1$ with $L(f,P_1) > I - \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$; by [L2] applied to $\mathcal{U}$, whose infimum is $I$, there is a partition $P_2$ with $U(f,P_2) < I + \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$. [step 1.3, L1, L2, choose]

3.1 Put $P_{\ast} := P_1 \vee P_2$, which refines both by [L3]. Then $L(f,P_{\ast}) \ge L(f,P_1) > I - \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$ and $U(f,P_{\ast}) \le U(f,P_2) < I + \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$, so $U(f,P_{\ast}) - L(f,P_{\ast}) < \eta$ by [L4]. Since $\eta > 0$ was arbitrary, the criterion holds. [step 2.2, L3, L4]

4.1 Steps 1.2 and 2.1 give the implication from the criterion to integrability, and steps 1.3, 2.2 and 3.1 give the converse; the two halves are independent and use no symbol in common, and together they are the stated equivalence. [step 2.1, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The strict inequality is not essential.** Requiring $U(f,P) - L(f,P) \le \varepsilon$ for every $\varepsilon > 0$ defines the same condition, since a partition working for $\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$ works strictly for $\varepsilon$. Statements below use whichever form is convenient and no consequence turns on the difference.

- **The common refinement is where the two partitions are reconciled.** Step 2.2 produces one partition good for the lower sum and another good for the upper sum, and there is no reason for them to be the same. [[lem-refinement-inequalities]] is exactly what allows a single partition to inherit both properties, and it is the only place in this proof where anything beyond the definitions is used.

- **No choice principle is used.** Steps 1.2, 2.2 and 3.1 instantiate finitely many existential statements, which is ordinary first-order reasoning. See [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].
