## Statement

Let $n\ge2$, and suppose there is a real $\delta>0$ such that $f$ is
$n$-times differentiable on the open interval
$N_\delta(c)=(c-\delta,c+\delta)$. Suppose
$f^{(j)}(c)=0$ for $1\le j<n$, while $f^{(n)}(c)\ne0$. If $n$ is
even, $c$ is a strict local minimum when $f^{(n)}(c)>0$ and a strict local
maximum when it is negative. If $n$ is odd, $c$ is not a local extremum
and $f(x)-f(c)$ changes sign at $c$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The derivative hypotheses on the open neighbourhood $N_\delta(c)$ of [[def-neighbourhood-r]].

[L1] Peano's formula is [[thm-taylor-peano-remainder]], with polynomial from [[def-taylor-polynomial-and-remainder]].

[L2] A function tending to a nonzero real keeps its sign nearby ([[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]]); parity controls the sign of integer powers ([[def-integer-power]], [[lem-power-monotone]]).

[L3] The factorial $n!$ is a nonzero natural, so its canonical real is positive ([[def-factorial-and-falling-factorial]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Peano's formula gives $f(x)-f(c)=(x-c)^n(f^{(n)}(c)/\iota(n!)+\varepsilon(x))$, where $\varepsilon(x)\to0$. The parenthesized factor has the sign of $f^{(n)}(c)$ near $c$.  [L1, L2, L3]

2.1 If $n$ is even, $(x-c)^n>0$ for $x\ne c$, so the difference has one strict sign on both sides, giving the asserted minimum or maximum.  [assume-case even, step 1.1, L2]

2.2 If $n$ is odd, $(x-c)^n$ has opposite signs on the two sides, so the difference changes sign and no local extremum occurs.  [assume-case odd, step 1.1, L2]

3.1 Every natural $n\ge1$ is even or odd, so the cases are exhaustive.  [step 2.1, step 2.2, cases-exhaustive] ∎

This is a proof obligation and not an\nobservation, and it is discharged by claim 2 of [[lem-power-laws]]: for $a \\ne 0$\nin a field, $a^n \\ne 0$ for every $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, proved there by induction on\n$n$ from the fact that a field has no zero divisors ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]).\nThat lemma is a statement *about* the operation introduced here, so it depends on\nthis definition and is recorded in this item's `justified_by` rather than in its\n`deps` (SCHEMA §3). Given $a^n \\ne 0$, the value $(a^n)^{-1}$ is a single\nwell-determined element, because multiplicative inverses in a field are unique\n([[lem-of-inverse-unique]]).\n\n**Integer exponents.** Every integer $m$ ([[def-integers]]) is either\n$\\iota(n)$ or $-\\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$, where $\\iota$ is the\nembedding $\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]],\n[[def-int-operations]]). This too is a citation and not a slogan: the order on\n$\\mathbb{Z}$ is total ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), so $m \\ge 0$ or $m < 0$; the\nimage of $\\iota$ is exactly the set of nonnegative integers, and each of them is\n$\\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]); and if $m < 0$ then\n$-m > 0$, by compatibility of the order with addition ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]),\nso $-m = \\iota(n)$ and $m = -\\iota(n)$, with $n$ unique because $\\iota$ is\ninjective. The two clauses above therefore define $a^m$ for every\n$m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ whenever $a \\ne 0$, and for every $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$ for\narbitrary $a$.

## Definition

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]) with additive identity $0_F$ and
multiplicative identity $1_F$. Define
$\iota : \mathbb{N} \to F$ by recursion on $\mathbb{N}$
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[thm-recursion]]):

$$\iota(0) \;:=\; 0_F, \qquad \iota(n+1) \;:=\; \iota(n) + 1_F .$$

$\iota(n)$ is the **canonical natural** of $n$ in $F$. It is also written
$n \cdot 1_F$, and for $n \ge 1$ it is $1_F$ added to itself $n$ times.

**Why the notation is needed at all.** A natural number in this library is a von
Neumann natural, that is a set ([[def-natural-numbers]]), and a set is not an
element of $F$. So $1/n$, $n^{\alpha}$ and $x/n$ are not expressions of $F$ when
$n$ is a natural: what they mean is $1/\iota(n)$, $\iota(n)^{\alpha}$ and
$x/\iota(n)$. The map $\iota$ is what carries a counting number into the field,
and writing it is the whole reason a reader meets $1/\iota(k+1)$ where an
informal text would write $1/(k+1)$.

## Remarks

- **Where the index shift comes from.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
  ([[def-natural-numbers]]) and $\iota(0) = 0_F$, so $1/\iota(k)$ is undefined at
  $k = 0$. A family of reciprocals indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ is therefore written
  over $\iota(k+1)$, which is why the harmonic and telescoping families of this
  library run over $k+1$ rather than over $k$. This is bookkeeping, not a
  restriction: the values are the usual ones.

- **This definition records notation; the arithmetic is proved elsewhere.** That
  $\iota$ is strictly increasing and positive on $n \ge 1$, and that it carries
  sums to sums and products to products, is [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], stated
  for an ordered field. That lemma introduces the same element by the equivalent
  recursion $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, which
  agrees with the definition above because $\iota(1) = \iota(0) + 1_F = 1_F$.
  Nothing here is new mathematics; the definition exists so that the notation has
  a home a reader can look up.

- **The symbol $\iota$ is used in this library for other canonical maps, and this
  definition does not govern them.** It also denotes the canonical field
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to F$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), the isometric
  embedding of a metric space into a completion ([[def-metric-completion]]), and
  an inclusion map $\iota : S \to X$ of a subspace. Each of those is introduced
  where it is used and means something different from the map defined here. What
  the four share is only that each is the canonical map of its situation.

- **Fields, not just ordered fields.** The recursion needs no order, so the
  definition is stated for a field; every use in this library is in an ordered
  field, and the order is what makes $\iota$ injective
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). In a field of positive characteristic $\iota$
  is not injective, which is one reason the injectivity is a lemma rather than
  part of the definition.

## Definition

**The factorial.** By the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) applied to the
set $\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$, the starting element $(0,1)$ and the function
$f(k, v) = (\sigma(k),\, v \cdot \sigma(k))$, and by the same induction on the
first coordinate as in [[def-nat-finite-sum-and-product]], there is a unique
$F : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ with

$$F(0) = 1, \qquad F(\sigma(n)) = F(n)\cdot\sigma(n) \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

We write $n! := F(n)$. Thus $0! = 1$, $1! = 0!\cdot 1 = 1$, $2! = 1!\cdot 2 = 2$,
$3! = 6$, $4! = 24$, $5! = 120$, $6! = 720$.

**$0! = 1$ is the base clause of this recursion**, not a convention imported from
elsewhere. Nothing about empty products is presupposed; the agreement with the
empty product is proved below, in clause (a), rather than assumed.

**Truncated difference.** Throughout, $n - k$ is the operation fixed in
[[def-nat-finite-sum-and-product]]: the unique $j$ with $k + j = n$ when
$k \le n$, and $0$ when $n < k$.

**The falling factorial.** For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ define $n^{\underline{k}}$ by
recursion on $k$, by the recursion theorem applied to
$\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ with starting element $(0,1)$ and
$f(k, v) = (\sigma(k),\, v \cdot (n-k))$:

$$n^{\underline{0}} = 1, \qquad n^{\underline{\sigma(k)}} = n^{\underline{k}}\cdot(n-k) .$$

So $n^{\underline{1}} = 1\cdot(n-0) = n$ and $n^{\underline{2}} = n\,(n-1)$, and
for $k \le n$ the value is the product $n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1)$ of the $k$ topmost
factors.

**Four facts, proved here because the page uses each of them.**

**(a) The factorial is the product of the first $n$ positive naturals.**
$n! = \prod_{j<n}\sigma(j) = \prod_{j<n}(j+1)$, the $\mathbb{N}$-valued product of
[[def-nat-finite-sum-and-product]]. Induction ([[thm-induction-principle]]): at
$n = 0$ both sides are $1$, the empty product and the base clause agreeing; and
$\prod_{j<\sigma(n)}\sigma(j) = \big(\prod_{j<n}\sigma(j)\big)\cdot\sigma(n) = n!\cdot\sigma(n) = \sigma(n)!$.
**So the empty-product reading and the base-clause reading are the same reading**,
and neither was assumed.

**(b) $n! \ne 0$, and $\iota(n!) = \prod^{\mathbb{R}}_{j<n}\iota(j+1)$.** For the
first, $0! = 1 \ne 0$ ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]) and
$\sigma(n)! = n!\cdot\sigma(n)$ is a product of two nonzero naturals, which is
nonzero: if $xy = 0$ with $y \ne 0$ then $xy = 0\cdot y$
([[lem-nat-mult-identity]]) and cancellation gives $x = 0$
([[lem-nat-mult-cancellative]]). So $n! \ne 0$ for every $n$ by induction. For the second, apply the bridge clause
6 of that lemma to clause (a) above. This is what makes the factorial of this
page and the real-valued product $\prod_{j<n}(j+1)$ used elsewhere in the library
**one object seen twice**, rather than two unrelated notions.

**(c) $n^{\underline{k}}\cdot(n-k)! = n!$ for $k \le n$.** Induction on $k$, for
all $n$ at once. At $k = 0$ this reads $1 \cdot n! = n!$. Assume it at $k$ and
let $\sigma(k) \le n$; then $k \le n$, and writing $d := n - k$ we have
$k + d = n$ and $d \ne 0$, since $k + 0 = k \ne n$; so $d = \sigma(e)$ for a
unique $e$ ([[lem-nat-nonzero-is-successor]]), and $\sigma(k) + e = n$, that is
$e = n - \sigma(k)$ ([[lem-nat-add-cancellative]]). Therefore
$n^{\underline{\sigma(k)}}\cdot\big(n-\sigma(k)\big)! = n^{\underline{k}}\cdot(n-k)\cdot e! = n^{\underline{k}}\cdot\big(e!\cdot\sigma(e)\big) = n^{\underline{k}}\cdot\sigma(e)! = n^{\underline{k}}\cdot(n-k)! = n!$,
using commutativity and associativity of multiplication
([[lem-nat-mult-associative]], [[lem-nat-mult-commutative]]) and the recursion
clause for the factorial.

**(d) Boundary values.** $n^{\underline{0}} = 1$ for every $n$, by the base
clause; $n^{\underline{n}} = n!$, since clause (c) at $k = n$ gives
$n^{\underline{n}}\cdot 0! = n!$ and $0! = 1$; and
$n^{\underline{k}} = 0$ whenever $k > n$. For the last, $n - n = 0$ gives
$n^{\underline{\sigma(n)}} = n^{\underline{n}}\cdot 0 = 0$, the clause
$x \cdot 0 = 0$ being definitional ([[def-nat-multiplication]]), and if
$n^{\underline{k}} = 0$ then
$n^{\underline{\sigma(k)}} = 0$ as well, so $n^{\underline{k}} = 0$ for every
$k \ge \sigma(n)$ by induction.

## Remarks

- **Why $0! = 1$ is not imported.** The empty-product convention of an arbitrary
  monoid is fixed in [[def-monoid-finite-product]], which comes later in the
  reading order, so citing it here would be a dependency pointing the wrong way.
  Taking $0! = 1$ as the base clause of the factorial's own recursion costs
  nothing and owes nothing, and clause (a) then records the agreement.

- **The library's other factorial.** [[lem-factorial-beats-geometric]], later in
  the reading order, works with a real-valued factorial defined as the product
  $\prod_{j<n}(j+1)$ in $\mathbb{R}$. Clause (b) says that this is exactly
  $\iota(n!)$, so the two agree and no second notion has been created. That
  pointer is orientation only.

- **Check every clause at $k = 0$ and at $k = n$.** The falling factorial is
  defined by two regimes, one for $k \le n$ and one beyond, and the recursion
  above covers both because the truncated difference is $0$ past the end. The
  two values that get used constantly are $n^{\underline{0}} = 1$ and
  $n^{\underline{n}} = n!$, and both are clause (d).

## Definition

Let $a \in \mathbb{R}$, where $\mathbb{R}$ is the ambient ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]).

**Natural exponents.** By the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) applied to
the set $\mathbb{R}$, the starting element $1$ and the function
$f(x) = x \cdot a$, there is a unique function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$,
written $n \mapsto a^n$, with

$$a^0 = 1, \qquad a^{n+1} = a^n \cdot a \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Thus $a^1 = a$, $a^2 = a \cdot a$, and so on. Note that this is defined for
**every** $a$, including $a = 0$.

**Negative exponents.** If $a \ne 0$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, set

$$a^{-n} := (a^n)^{-1}.$$

**Why that is legitimate.** The right-hand side presupposes that $a^n$ is
invertible, that is, that $a^n \ne 0$. This is a proof obligation and not an
observation, and it is discharged by claim 2 of [[lem-power-laws]]: for $a \ne 0$
in a field, $a^n \ne 0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, proved there by induction on
$n$ from the fact that a field has no zero divisors ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]).
That lemma is a statement *about* the operation introduced here, so it depends on
this definition and is recorded in this item's `justified_by` rather than in its
`deps` (SCHEMA §3). Given $a^n \ne 0$, the value $(a^n)^{-1}$ is a single
well-determined element, because multiplicative inverses in a field are unique
([[lem-of-inverse-unique]]).

**Integer exponents.** Every integer $m$ ([[def-integers]]) is either
$\iota(n)$ or $-\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$, where $\iota$ is the
embedding $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]],
[[def-int-operations]]). This too is a citation and not a slogan: the order on
$\mathbb{Z}$ is total ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), so $m \ge 0$ or $m < 0$; the
image of $\iota$ is exactly the set of nonnegative integers, and each of them is
$\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]); and if $m < 0$ then
$-m > 0$, by compatibility of the order with addition ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]),
so $-m = \iota(n)$ and $m = -\iota(n)$, with $n$ unique because $\iota$ is
injective. The two clauses above therefore define $a^m$ for every
$m \in \mathbb{Z}$ whenever $a \ne 0$, and for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$ for
arbitrary $a$. The clauses are consistent where they overlap: the only overlap is
$m = 0$, where $-\iota(0) = \iota(0)$ and $(a^0)^{-1} = 1^{-1} = 1 = a^0$.

## Remarks

- **The convention $0^0 = 1$ is adopted here**, and it is not a matter of taste
  but of agreement with the recursion above: $a^0 = 1$ is the starting value for
  every $a$, exactly as the empty product is $1$ ([[def-finite-sum]]). This is
  the convention that makes the empty product, the binomial theorem, and
  polynomial notation $\sum_k c_k x^k$ work at $x = 0$ without an exception. The
  competing convention "$0^0$ undefined" belongs to contexts where $x^y$ is
  studied as a function of two *real* variables and one wants continuity, which
  is unavailable and irrelevant here: the exponent in $a^m$ is an integer, never
  a real.
- $0^n = 0$ for every $n \ge 1$, since $0^{n} = 0^{n-1} \cdot 0 = 0$, a product
  with a zero factor ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]); and
  $0^{-n}$ is not defined for $n \ge 1$, since $0$ has no inverse.
- The exponent is an integer and stays an integer. Rational exponents are a
  separate construction resting on the existence of roots
  ([[thm-nth-roots-exist]], [[def-rational-power]]), and real exponents do not
  exist in this library yet ([[rem-real-exponents-deferred]]).
- The laws $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$ are
  proved, not assumed, in [[lem-power-laws]]; the order behaviour of $a \mapsto a^n$
  is [[lem-power-monotone]].

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]) and its absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]).

Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ with
$\varepsilon > 0$. The **$\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\},$$

and the **punctured $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \;=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}.$$

The two descriptions of $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ agree because $|y - x| = 0$ holds
exactly when $y = x$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**A neighbourhood is an open interval.** For every $x$ and every
$\varepsilon > 0$,

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;=\; (x - \varepsilon,\ x + \varepsilon),$$

the interval of [[def-interval]]. Indeed [[lem-of-abs-value]] gives, for
$\varepsilon > 0$, the equivalence $|y - x| < \varepsilon \iff -\varepsilon <
y - x < \varepsilon$, and adding $x$ throughout turns the right-hand side into
$x - \varepsilon < y < x + \varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**The centre lies in its own neighbourhoods.** $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, since
$|x - x| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**Punctured neighbourhoods are never empty.** The element
$y := x + \varepsilon/2$ satisfies $|y - x| = \varepsilon/2$, which is
$> 0$ and $< \varepsilon$, so $y \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$
([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

**Monotonicity in the radius.** If $0 < \delta \le \varepsilon$ then
$N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, because $|y - x| < \delta \le
\varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**Nesting at an interior point.** If $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and
$0 < \delta \le \varepsilon - |y - x|$, then

$$N_\delta(y) \;\subseteq\; N_\varepsilon(x).$$

Indeed for $z \in N_\delta(y)$ the triangle inequality
([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]) gives
$|z - x| = |(z - y) + (y - x)| \le |z - y| + |y - x| < \delta + |y - x| \le
\varepsilon$. Note that $\varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ precisely because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, so such a $\delta$ always exists.

## Remarks

- **The radius is a real number, not a rational.** Nothing on this page tests a
  condition against rational radii only. That convention belongs to
  [[def-real-limit]], where the quantifier is over rational $\varepsilon$ and
  the passage between the rational and the real form is the sanctioned remark of
  [[def-sequence]]. Here $\varepsilon$ ranges over the positive reals
  throughout, and every statement above is proved for an arbitrary positive
  real.

- **Why the punctured version is separated out.** A limit point of a set is a
  point every punctured neighbourhood of which meets the set
  ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and deleting the centre is exactly what stops a point
  of the set from qualifying automatically. The unpunctured condition defines
  the weaker notion of an adherent point, and the difference between the two is
  precisely an isolated point.

- **Nesting is the workhorse.** Almost every openness verification on this page
  has the shape "given $y$ in the set, shrink the radius by the distance
  already travelled", which is the nesting property above. It is recorded here
  once so that no later proof has to redo the triangle inequality in passing.

## Definition

Let $n\in\mathbb N$, let $f$ have derivatives through order $n$ at $a$, and let $\iota:\mathbb N\to\mathbb R$ be the canonical embedding. The **Taylor polynomial of degree at most $n$ about $a$** is
$$T_{n,a}f(x):=\sum_{j=0}^{n}\frac{f^{(j)}(a)}{\iota(j!)}(x-a)^j.$$
The **Taylor remainder** is $R_{n,a}f(x):=f(x)-T_{n,a}f(x)$.

The factorials are natural numbers as in [[def-factorial-and-falling-factorial]] and enter real arithmetic only through $\iota$ ([[def-canonical-natural]]); they are nonzero ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). The sum and powers are those of [[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], and [[def-integer-power]]. For $n=0$, $T_{0,a}f$ is the constant $f(a)$.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field, with field structure as in [[def-field]], and for
$n \ge 1$ let $n \cdot 1_F$ denote the canonical natural number
$\underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$, defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$
and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$. Then for every $n \ge 1$:

- $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$;
- the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$;
- $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ and $(mn) \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F)$ for all $m, n \ge 1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ whose canonical naturals are defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, with $0 \cdot 1_F = 0$.

[L1] $0 < 1_F$ in every ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] The order is compatible with addition and positives are closed under addition: $a < b$ implies $a + c < b + c$, and $a > 0$, $b > 0$ imply $a + b > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 1$: by definition $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, and $1_F > 0$. [L1, base]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: assume $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for some fixed $n \ge 1$. [ih]

1.3 By the recursion, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F - n \cdot 1_F = 1_F > 0$, so $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$. [given, L1]

1.4 Additive identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ by the recursion, and if $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ then $(m+n+1) \cdot 1_F = (m+n) \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + (n+1) \cdot 1_F$. [given, algebra]

2.1 Inductive step: $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ is a sum of two positives, by the hypothesis and $1_F > 0$, hence $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Iterating 1.3, for $m < n$ one has $m \cdot 1_F < n \cdot 1_F$, so $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing and therefore injective on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$. [step 1.3, L2]

2.3 Multiplicative identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m \cdot 1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(1 \cdot 1_F)$, and the step $(m(n+1)) \cdot 1_F = (mn + m) \cdot 1_F = (mn) \cdot 1_F + m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F) + (m \cdot 1_F)(1_F) = (m \cdot 1_F)((n+1) \cdot 1_F)$ uses 1.4 and distributivity. [step 1.4, algebra]

3.1 By induction on 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for every $n \ge 1$; with the strict increase 2.2 and the identities 1.4, 2.3, every claim holds. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 1.4, step 2.3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $\mathbb{R}$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]), let
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $n \in \mathbb{N}$, with powers as in
[[def-integer-power]].

1. **Signs.** If $a \ge 0$ then $a^n \ge 0$, and if $a > 0$ then $a^n > 0$.
2. **Strict monotonicity in the base.** If $0 \le a < b$ and $n \ge 1$ then $a^n < b^n$. Consequently, for $a, b \ge 0$ and $n \ge 1$: $a < b \iff a^n < b^n$ and $a \le b \iff a^n \le b^n$, and $x \mapsto x^n$ is injective on $\{x \in \mathbb{R} : x \ge 0\}$.
3. **Comparison with the base.** If $a \ge 1$ and $n \ge 1$ then $a^n \ge a \ge 1$; if $a > 1$ and $n \ge 1$ then $a^n \ge a > 1$; and if $0 \le a \le 1$ then $a^n \le 1$.
4. **Monotonicity in the exponent.** If $a > 1$ then $a^m < a^n$ whenever $m < n$ in $\mathbb{N}$; if $a = 1$ then $a^n = 1$ for all $n$; and if $0 < a < 1$ then $a^m > a^n$ whenever $m < n$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $\mathbb{R}$, elements $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and naturals $m, n$.

[L1] Definition of powers ([[def-integer-power]]): $a^0 = 1$ and $a^{n+1} = a^n a$.

[L2] Induction principle ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L3] Sign and scaling rules: a product of positives is positive, and for $c > 0$, $x < y \iff cx < cy$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]); the positives are closed under addition and satisfy trichotomy ([[def-ordered-field]]); and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]], which is where that fact is proved: neither of the two items just named states it).

[L4] Multiplying inequalities of nonnegatives: if $0 \le x \le y$ and $0 \le u \le v$ then $xu \le yv$, and if $0 < x < y$ and $0 < u < v$ then $xu < yv$ ([[prop-of-multiply-inequalities]]).

[L5] Trichotomy and transitivity of the order: for $x, y$ exactly one of $x < y$, $x = y$, $y < x$ holds, and $<$ and $\le$ are transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L6] The order on the exponents: $m \le n$ holds exactly when $n = m + k$ for some natural $k$ ([[def-nat-order]]), and $m < n$ holds exactly when $m + 1 \le n$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]); combining the two, $m < n$ holds exactly when $n = m + d$ for some natural $d \ge 1$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 0$: $a^0 = 1 > 0$, so claim 1 holds; claim 2 is vacuous at $n = 0$; $a^0 = 1 \ge 1$ and $a^0 = 1 \le 1$, so claim 3 holds at $n = 0$ in the nonstrict readings. [base, L1, L3]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume, for all $a, b$: $a \ge 0 \Rightarrow a^n \ge 0$ and $a > 0 \Rightarrow a^n > 0$; and $0 \le a \le b \Rightarrow a^n \le b^n$, with $a^n < b^n$ when moreover $a < b$ and $n \ge 1$. [ih]

2.1 Signs at $n+1$: if $a \ge 0$ then $a^{n+1} = a^n a$ is a product of two nonnegatives, hence $\ge 0$, and if $a > 0$ it is a product of two positives, hence $> 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L3, L4]

3.1 Strict monotonicity at $n+1$, assuming $0 \le a < b$: then $b > 0$, and the hypothesis gives $0 \le a^n \le b^n$ with $b^n > 0$ by step 2.1; if $a = 0$ then $a^{n+1} = 0 < b^{n+1}$ since $b^{n+1} = b^n b > 0$; if $a > 0$ then $a^{n+1} = a^n a \le b^n a$ by multiplying $a^n \le b^n$ by $a > 0$, and $b^n a < b^n b$ by multiplying $a < b$ by $b^n > 0$, so $a^{n+1} < b^{n+1}$ by transitivity; and in either case $0 \le a \le b$ gives $a^{n+1} \le b^{n+1}$ by [L4]. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L1, L3, L4, L5]

4.1 By the induction principle, claims 1 and 2 hold for every $n$, in the form: $a \ge 0 \Rightarrow a^n \ge 0$; $a > 0 \Rightarrow a^n > 0$; and $0 \le a < b$ with $n \ge 1$ gives $a^n < b^n$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 3.1, L2]

5.1 The equivalences of claim 2 follow by trichotomy: for $a, b \ge 0$ and $n \ge 1$, if $a^n < b^n$ then neither $a = b$ (which would give $a^n = b^n$) nor $b < a$ (which would give $b^n < a^n$) is possible, so $a < b$; the $\le$ form is the negation of the $<$ form with $a$ and $b$ exchanged; and injectivity is the case $a^n = b^n$, where $a < b$ and $b < a$ are both excluded. [step 4.1, L5]

5.2 Claim 4: for $a > 1$ we have $a^{n+1} = a^n a > a^n \cdot 1 = a^n$, multiplying $1 < a$ by $a^n > 0$, so $a^n$ is strictly increasing in $n$, and hence $a^m < a^n$ whenever $m < n$: writing $n = m + d$ with $d \ge 1$ and inducting on $d$, the case $d = 1$ is that one-step inequality and the passage from $d$ to $d+1$ is $a^m < a^{m+d} < a^{m+d+1}$ by transitivity; for $a = 1$ an induction gives $1^n = 1$ for all $n$; and for $0 < a < 1$ we have $a^{n+1} = a^n a < a^n \cdot 1 = a^n$, so $a^n$ is strictly decreasing in $n$ and the same induction on the gap $d$ gives $a^m > a^n$ for $m < n$. [step 4.1, L1, L2, L3, L5, L6]

6.1 Claim 3: if $a \ge 1$ and $n \ge 1$ then applying step 4.1 to $1 \le a$ gives $1 = 1^n \le a^n$, and $a^n = a^{n-1} a \ge 1 \cdot a = a$ since $a^{n-1} \ge 1$ by the same argument and $a > 0$; if $a > 1$ the same computation gives $a^n \ge a > 1$; and if $0 \le a \le 1$ then $a^n \le 1^n = 1$. [step 4.1, step 5.1, L1, L3, L4]

7.1 All four claims are proved: signs and strict monotonicity in the base by the induction of steps 1.1 and 3.1, the order equivalences and injectivity by trichotomy, and the comparisons with the base and the behaviour in the exponent by steps 6.1 and 5.2. [step 4.1, step 5.1, step 6.1, step 5.2, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $c$ be a limit point of $A$
([[def-limit-point-r]]), let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and suppose the limit of $f$
at $c$ exists with $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$ and $L \ne 0$
([[def-function-limit]]). Then there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every
$x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies

$$|f(x)| \;>\; \frac{|L|}{2} \;>\; 0 ;$$

in particular $f(x) \ne 0$ for every such $x$. Moreover:

- if $L > 0$ then $f(x) > L/2 > 0$ for every such $x$;
- if $L < 0$ then $f(x) < L/2 < 0$ for every such $x$.

Consequently, writing

$$A_0 := \{\, x \in A \ : \ f(x) \ne 0 \,\},$$

the point $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$.

**The bound $|L|/2$, and not merely "$f \ne 0$", is what later proofs need.** The
quotient case of [[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]] estimates $1/|f|$ near $c$
and therefore needs a *positive lower* bound on $|f|$ there, and the last claim
is what lets a limit be taken on the smaller domain $A_0$ at all.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a limit point $c$ of $A$, a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and a real $L \ne 0$ with $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$; and $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : f(x) \ne 0 \,\}$ ([[def-function-limit]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L1] The limit condition: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ ([[def-function-limit]]).

[L2] Absolute value: $|u| \ge 0$; $|u| = 0$ if and only if $u = 0$; $|u| = u$ for $u \ge 0$ and $|u| = -u$ for $u \le 0$; and for $t > 0$, $|u| < t$ is equivalent to $-t < u < t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L3] Reverse triangle inequality: $\bigl| |u| - |v| \bigr| \le |u - v|$ ([[cor-of-reverse-triangle]]).

[L4] Limit point: for every real $\rho > 0$ there is $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \rho$ ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L5] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: trichotomy, so $u \ne 0$ with $|u| \ge 0$ and $|u| \ne 0$ forces $|u| > 0$; $0 < 1$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]), hence $2 > 0$ and $2^{-1} > 0$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]), so $t/2 > 0$ and $t - t/2 = t/2$ for $t > 0$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]); adding a constant to an inequality ([[lem-of-add-order]]); and of two positive reals the smaller is positive, the order being total ([[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Since $L \ne 0$ we have $|L| \ne 0$ while $|L| \ge 0$, so trichotomy gives $|L| > 0$, and $\varepsilon := |L|/2 > 0$ with $|L| - |L|/2 = |L|/2$. [given, L2, L5]

2.1 Apply [L1] with this $\varepsilon$: fix a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|f(x) - L| < |L|/2$. [step 1.1, L1, choose]

3.1 For every such $x$ the reverse triangle inequality gives $\bigl| |f(x)| - |L| \bigr| \le |f(x) - L| < |L|/2$, hence $|f(x)| - |L| > -|L|/2$ and so $|f(x)| > |L| - |L|/2 = |L|/2 > 0$; in particular $|f(x)| \ne 0$ and therefore $f(x) \ne 0$. [step 2.1, L2, L3, L5]

3.2 If $L > 0$ then $|L| = L$, and for every such $x$ the estimate $|f(x) - L| < L/2$ gives $-L/2 < f(x) - L$, that is $f(x) > L - L/2 = L/2 > 0$. [step 2.1, L2, L5]

3.3 If $L < 0$ then $|L| = -L$, and for every such $x$ the estimate $|f(x) - L| < -L/2$ gives $f(x) - L < -L/2$, that is $f(x) < L - L/2 = L/2 < 0$. [step 2.1, L2, L5]

4.1 Let $\eta > 0$ be an arbitrary real and let $\rho$ be the smaller of $\delta$ and $\eta$, so $\rho > 0$. Since $c$ is a limit point of $A$ there is $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \rho$; that $x$ satisfies $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, hence $f(x) \ne 0$ by step 3.1, so $x \in A_0$ and $0 < |x - c| < \eta$. As $\eta$ was arbitrary, $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$. [step 3.1, L4, L5]

5.1 So on $A \cap N^{*}_{\delta}(c)$ the function is bounded away from $0$ by $|L|/2$ and carries the sign of $L$, and $c$ remains a limit point of the set $A_0$ where $f$ does not vanish. [step 3.1, step 3.2, step 3.3, step 4.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why $|L|/2$ and not some other fraction.** Any $\varepsilon$ strictly between $0$ and $|L|$ gives a positive lower bound $|L| - \varepsilon$; the choice $\varepsilon = |L|/2$ makes the bound $|L|/2$, which is the form used downstream and needs only that $2$ is invertible and positive ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

- **The last claim is the one that is easy to forget.** Restricting a quotient to the set where the denominator does not vanish is useless unless $c$ is still a limit point of that set, since [[def-function-limit]] is stated only at a limit point. Step 4.1 is exactly that check, and it is what [[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]] cites when it forms $A_0$.

- **Nothing here says anything about $f(c)$.** As always the point $c$ itself is excluded by $0 < |x - c|$, so $f(c)$ may be $0$ even when $L \ne 0$; the function of [[fs-limit-equals-value]], read with the roles of $0$ and $1$ exchanged, is such an example.

## Statement

Let $n\ge1$. If there is a real $\delta>0$ such that $f$ is
$n$-times differentiable on the open interval
$N_\delta(a)=(a-\delta,a+\delta)$, then
$$\frac{R_{n,a}f(x)}{(x-a)^n}\longrightarrow0\qquad(x\to a).$$
Equivalently, in the usual little-$o$ shorthand,
$f(x)=T_{n,a}f(x)+o((x-a)^n)$. For $n=0$, the analogous assertion is the
separate continuity condition at $a$: for every $\varepsilon>0$, all
domain points $x$ sufficiently near $a$ satisfy
$|f(x)-f(a)|<\varepsilon$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The stated differentiability on the open neighbourhood $N_\delta(a)$ of [[def-neighbourhood-r]], or the separate continuity hypothesis when $n=0$.

[L1] Taylor polynomials and their matching derivatives are [[def-taylor-polynomial-and-remainder]] and [[lem-taylor-polynomial-derivatives]].

[L2] The derivative quotient is [[def-derivative]], differentiability implies continuity ([[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]]), and continuity at $a$ has the stated quantified condition ([[def-continuity-real]]). The Cauchy quotient lemma is [[lem-cauchy-mean-value-quotient-form]], the shifted-power derivative follows from [[lem-derivative-of-a-power]] and [[thm-chain-rule]], and finite limits are [[def-function-limit]] and obey [[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]].

[L3] For $n\ge1$, the canonical real $\iota(n)$ is positive and hence nonzero ([[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Under the separate $n=0$ hypothesis, the quantified assertion is exactly the definition of continuity at $a$.  [given, L2]

1.2 For $n=1$, the derivative definition gives $$\frac{f(x)-f(a)-f'(a)(x-a)}{x-a} =\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}-f'(a)\longrightarrow0.$$ This is the required base case.  [base, given, L2]

1.3 Assume $n\ge2$ and the assertion through order $n-1$. Put $R=R_{n,a}f$. Then $R(a)=R'(a)=0$, and $R'(x)=R_{n-1,a}(f')(x)$.  [L1, algebra]

2.1 By the induction hypothesis applied to $f'$, $R'(x)/(x-a)^{n-1}\to0$. Applying the Cauchy quotient lemma to $R(x)-R(a)$ and $(x-a)^n$ gives $R(x)/(x-a)^n=R'(\xi)/(\iota(n)(\xi-a)^{n-1})$ for a point $\xi$ between $a$ and $x$.  [step 1.3, ih, L2, L3]

3.1 Since $\xi\to a$, the right side tends to $0$. This proves the Peano estimate without assuming continuity of $f^{(n)}$.  [step 2.1, L2, discharge-induction] ∎
