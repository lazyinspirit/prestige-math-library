## Example

At $x=1$,
$$\lim_{x\to1}\frac{x^3-x}{x^2-1}=1.$$

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The displayed quotient on a punctured neighbourhood of $1$.

[L1] The zero-over-zero theorem is [[thm-lhopital-zero-over-zero]].

[L2] Power derivatives and limit algebra are [[lem-derivative-of-a-power]], [[thm-algebra-of-derivatives]], and [[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]].

## Verification

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Numerator and denominator tend to $0$, the denominator derivative $2x$ is nonzero near $1$, and the derivative quotient $(3x^2-1)/(2x)$ tends to $1$.  [L2, algebra]

2.1 Applying [L1] gives the limit $1$. Direct factorization to $x$ away from $x=\pm1$ confirms the removable nature of the quotient at $1$.  [step 1.1, L1, algebra] ∎

## Statement

Powers are those of [[def-integer-power]], and $\iota : \mathbb{N} \to
\mathbb{R}$ is the canonical natural of [[def-canonical-natural]], so that
$\iota(0) = 0$ and $\iota(m+1) = \iota(m) + 1$. Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

1. The function $p_0 : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, $p_0(x) = x^{0}$, is the
   constant function $1$, and it is differentiable at every $c \in \mathbb{R}$
   with $p_0'(c) = 0$ ([[def-derivative]]).
2. For $n \ge 1$ the function $p_n : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$,
   $p_n(x) = x^{n}$, is differentiable at every $c \in \mathbb{R}$, and
   $$p_n'(c) \;=\; \iota(n)\,c^{\,n-1} .$$
3. For $n \ge 1$ put $A_0 := \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \ne 0 \,\}$. The function
   $m_n : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$, $m_n(x) = x^{-n}$, is differentiable at every
   $c \in A_0$ as a function on $A_0$, and
   $$m_n'(c) \;=\; -\,\iota(n)\,c^{\,-n-1} .$$
4. Let $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with $a_j = 0$ for $j \ge n$, and let
   $P : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be the polynomial function
   $P(x) = \sum_{j<n} a_j x^{j}$ ([[def-finite-sum]]). Then $P$ is
   differentiable at every $c \in \mathbb{R}$, and, defining $e : \mathbb{N}
   \to \mathbb{R}$ by $e_0 := 0$ and $e_j := \iota(j)\,a_j\,c^{\,j-1}$ for
   $j \ge 1$,
   $$P'(c) \;=\; \sum_{j<n} e_j .$$

**Claim 2 is stated for $n \ge 1$ and not for $n \ge 0$, and that is not
timidity.** At $n = 0$ its right-hand side reads $\iota(0)\,c^{-1}$, and
$c^{-1}$ is not defined at $c = 0$ ([[def-integer-power]]), so the formula is
not a statement about the whole line. Claim 1 is what covers $n = 0$, and it
says the derivative is $0$ there, which is what the informal reading
"$0 \cdot c^{-1}$" is reaching for. The same shift is why the term $e_0$ of
claim 4 is defined to be $0$ outright rather than by the formula.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural $n$, a real $c$, and the functions $p_n$, $m_n$ and $P$ of the statement.

[L1] Powers ([[def-integer-power]]): $a^{0} = 1$ and $a^{m+1} = a^{m}a$ for every $a \in \mathbb{R}$ and $m \in \mathbb{N}$; $a^{-m} := (a^{m})^{-1}$ for $a \ne 0$ and $m \ge 1$; and $0^{m} = 0$ for $m \ge 1$.

[L2] Canonical naturals ([[def-canonical-natural]]): $\iota(0) = 0$, $\iota(m+1) = \iota(m) + 1$, and hence $\iota(1) = 1$.

[L3] Algebra of derivatives ([[thm-algebra-of-derivatives]]): at a limit point $c$ of the common domain, sums, scalar multiples and products of functions differentiable at $c$ are differentiable at $c$ with the four stated formulas, and if the denominator is nonzero at $c$ then the quotient, restricted to the set where the denominator does not vanish, is differentiable at $c$ with the quotient formula; that restricted set has $c$ as a limit point.

[L4] Derivative and difference quotient ([[def-derivative]]): $f$ is differentiable at a limit point $c$ of its domain $D$ exactly when the difference quotient $x \mapsto (f(x)-f(c))/(x-c)$, a function on $D \setminus \{c\}$, has a limit at $c$, and $f'(c)$ is that limit. A constant function $h \equiv K$ on a set having $c$ as a limit point has $\lim_{x \to c} h(x) = K$: given a real $\varepsilon > 0$, any real $\delta > 0$ serves, since $|K - K| = 0 < \varepsilon$ ([[def-function-limit]]).

[L5] Induction principle on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L6] Finite sums ([[def-finite-sum]]): $\sum_{j<0} b_j = 0$ and $\sum_{j<m+1} b_j = \bigl(\sum_{j<m} b_j\bigr) + b_m$.

[L7] Integer exponent laws for a nonzero base ([[lem-power-laws]]): $a^{k} \ne 0$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ when $a \ne 0$; and for integers $j, k$ one has $a^{j}a^{k} = a^{j+k}$, $(a^{j})^{k} = a^{jk}$ and $a^{-k} = (a^{k})^{-1}$.

[L8] Every real is a limit point of $\mathbb{R}$, punctured neighbourhoods in $\mathbb{R}$ being never empty ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 **Base case, claim 2 at $n = 1$.** By [L1], $x^{1} = x^{0}x = 1 \cdot x = x$, so $p_1$ is the identity. Fix $c \in \mathbb{R}$; for every $x \ne c$ the difference quotient is $(x - c)/(x - c) = 1$, so it is the constant function $1$ on $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{c\}$, and by [L4] and [L8] its limit at $c$ is $1$. Since $\iota(1)c^{0} = 1 \cdot 1 = 1$ by [L1] and [L2], claim 2 holds at $n = 1$. [base, L1, L2, L4, L8]

1.2 **Inductive hypothesis.** Fix a natural $n \ge 1$ and assume that $p_n$ is differentiable at every $c \in \mathbb{R}$ with $p_n'(c) = \iota(n)c^{\,n-1}$. [ih]

1.3 **Claim 1.** By [L1] the function $p_0$ is the constant function $1$. Fix $c \in \mathbb{R}$; for every $x \ne c$ its difference quotient is $(1-1)/(x-c) = 0$, the constant function $0$ on $\mathbb{R}\setminus\{c\}$, whose limit at $c$ is $0$ by [L4] and [L8]. So $p_0$ is differentiable at every $c$ with $p_0'(c) = 0$. [L1, L4, L8]

2.1 **Successor step.** Let $c \in \mathbb{R}$. By [L1], $p_{n+1}(x) = x^{n+1} = x^{n}x = p_n(x)\,p_1(x)$ for every $x$. Both factors are differentiable at $c$, by step 1.2 and step 1.1, so the product rule of [L3] gives that $p_{n+1}$ is differentiable at $c$ with $p_{n+1}'(c) = p_n'(c)p_1(c) + p_n(c)p_1'(c) = \iota(n)c^{\,n-1}c + c^{n} \cdot 1$. Now $c^{\,n-1}c = c^{\,(n-1)+1} = c^{n}$ by [L1], so the right-hand side is $\iota(n)c^{n} + c^{n} = \bigl(\iota(n)+1\bigr)c^{n} = \iota(n+1)c^{n}$ by [L2]. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1, L2, L3]

3.1 **Claim 2.** Steps 1.1 and 2.1 are the base case and the successor step of an induction over the naturals $n \ge 1$, so by [L5] the function $p_n$ is differentiable at every $c \in \mathbb{R}$ with $p_n'(c) = \iota(n)c^{\,n-1}$, for every natural $n \ge 1$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L5]

4.1 **Claim 3.** Let $n \ge 1$. The set $\{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : p_n(x) \ne 0 \,\}$ is exactly $A_0$: a nonzero $x$ has $x^{n} \ne 0$ by [L7], and $0^{n} = 0$ by [L1]. Fix $c \in A_0$. The constant function $1$ on $\mathbb{R}$ is differentiable at $c$ with derivative $0$ by step 1.3, and $p_n$ is differentiable at $c$ with derivative $\iota(n)c^{\,n-1}$ by step 3.1, with $p_n(c) = c^{n} \ne 0$. So the quotient rule of [L3] applies: the function $x \mapsto 1/x^{n}$ on $A_0$, which by [L1] and [L7] is $m_n$, is differentiable at $c$ with derivative $\bigl(0 \cdot c^{n} - 1 \cdot \iota(n)c^{\,n-1}\bigr)/(c^{n})^{2} = -\iota(n)\,c^{\,n-1}\bigl(c^{\,2n}\bigr)^{-1} = -\iota(n)\,c^{\,n-1-2n} = -\iota(n)\,c^{\,-n-1}$, where $(c^{n})^{2} = c^{\,2n}$ and $c^{\,n-1}c^{\,-2n} = c^{\,-n-1}$ are [L7]. [step 1.3, step 3.1, L1, L3, L7]

4.2 **Claim 4, by a second induction on $n$.** Fix $c \in \mathbb{R}$ and the sequence $a$. At $n = 0$ the sum $P(x) = \sum_{j<0} a_j x^{j}$ is $0$ for every $x$ by [L6], so $P$ is the constant function $0$ and, as in step 1.3, $P'(c) = 0 = \sum_{j<0} e_j$. Suppose the claim holds at $n$, and let $P_{n+1}(x) := \sum_{j<n+1} a_j x^{j}$. By [L6], $P_{n+1}(x) = P_n(x) + a_n x^{n}$ for every $x$, where $P_n(x) = \sum_{j<n} a_j x^{j}$. The function $x \mapsto a_n x^{n}$ is differentiable at $c$ with derivative $e_n$: for $n = 0$ it is the constant $a_n$, of derivative $0 = e_0$, by step 1.3 and the scalar rule of [L3]; for $n \ge 1$ it is the scalar multiple $a_n p_n$, of derivative $a_n \iota(n)c^{\,n-1} = e_n$, by step 3.1 and the scalar rule of [L3]. The inductive hypothesis gives $P_n'(c) = \sum_{j<n} e_j$, so the sum rule of [L3] gives that $P_{n+1}$ is differentiable at $c$ with $P_{n+1}'(c) = \sum_{j<n} e_j + e_n = \sum_{j<n+1} e_j$ by [L6]. By [L5] claim 4 holds for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 1.3, step 3.1, L3, L5, L6]

5.1 All four claims are established: claim 1 by step 1.3, claim 2 by step 3.1, claim 3 by step 4.1 and claim 4 by step 4.2. [step 1.3, step 3.1, step 4.1, step 4.2, discharge-induction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the induction starts at $n = 1$ and not at $n = 0$.** The successor step multiplies by the identity, and the identity is $p_1$; starting at $n = 0$ would require the formula of claim 2 to hold at $n = 0$, which it does not, since $c^{-1}$ is undefined at $c = 0$. The two statements are therefore kept apart, and claim 1 is proved on its own from the definition. This is the same index care that [[def-canonical-natural]] records for families of reciprocals: $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$, and a formula written for "$n$" is a claim about $n = 0$ unless it says otherwise.

- **The negative exponents cost nothing extra.** Claim 3 is the quotient rule of [[thm-algebra-of-derivatives]] applied with numerator the constant $1$, and the domain it produces, the set where $x^{n}$ does not vanish, is exactly $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$; no separate argument and no separate limit is needed. Rational exponents are a different matter, resting on [[thm-nth-roots-exist]], and are treated on the companion page rather than here.

- **Claim 4 is a statement about a finite sum, not about an infinite one.** Nothing here says anything about differentiating a series term by term; that is a separate question, needing hypotheses about convergence that this page does not have and does not assume.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $c \in A$ be a limit point of $A$
([[def-limit-point-r]]), let $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ be differentiable at $c$
([[def-derivative]]) and let $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$. Then:

1. $f + g$ is differentiable at $c$ and $(f+g)'(c) = f'(c) + g'(c)$;
2. $\alpha f$ is differentiable at $c$ and $(\alpha f)'(c) = \alpha f'(c)$;
3. $fg$ is differentiable at $c$ and $(fg)'(c) = f'(c)g(c) + f(c)g'(c)$;
4. if $g(c) \ne 0$ then, writing $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$, the
   point $c$ lies in $A_0$ and is a limit point of $A_0$, the quotient
   $(f/g)|_{A_0} : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$, $x \mapsto f(x)/g(x)$, is differentiable
   at $c$ as a function on $A_0$, and
   $$\bigl((f/g)|_{A_0}\bigr)'(c) \;=\; \frac{f'(c)\,g(c) - f(c)\,g'(c)}{g(c)^{2}} .$$

Each claim asserts two things: that the derivative on the left exists, and that
it has the stated value. Both are proved.

**Why claim 4 is stated on $A_0$.** The function $f/g$ is not defined where $g$
vanishes, and $g$ may vanish at points of $A$ far from $c$; restricting to $A_0$
is forced. That the restriction still has $c$ as a limit point, so that a
derivative there means anything at all, is not free either, and it is the last
claim of [[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]] applied to $g$. The hypothesis
is $g(c) \ne 0$, not "$g$ vanishes nowhere".

**Everything is proved through
[[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]].** No difference quotient is estimated and
no limit theorem beyond continuity is used, so no choice principle is spent.
The four identities are four algebraic rearrangements of an increment, each
followed by a reading of [[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a point $c \in A$ that is a limit point of $A$, functions $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ differentiable at $c$, and a real $\alpha$; for claim 4 also the hypothesis $g(c) \ne 0$ together with $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$ ([[def-derivative]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L1] Carathéodory's characterisation ([[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]]), used in both directions: for a set $B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a point $p \in B$ that is a limit point of $B$ and a function $h : B \to \mathbb{R}$, the function $h$ is differentiable at $p$ if and only if there is $\eta : B \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $p$, with $h(x) - h(p) = \eta(x)(x - p)$ for every $x \in B$, and then $\eta(p) = h'(p)$.

[L2] Algebra of continuous functions ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]]): sums, scalar multiples and products of functions continuous at a point are continuous there (claim 1); every constant function and the identity are continuous everywhere on the domain (claim 5); and if $u, v$ are continuous at a point $p$ of their common domain $D$ with $v(p) \ne 0$, then $p$ lies in $D_0 := \{x \in D : v(x) \ne 0\}$ and $(u/v)|_{D_0}$ is continuous at $p$ as a function on $D_0$ (claim 4).

[L3] Continuity passes to a subset of the domain: if $B \subseteq A$, if $p \in B$ and if $\psi : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $p$, then $\psi|_B$ is continuous at $p$, the condition on the restriction quantifying over fewer points ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L4] A function differentiable at $c$ is continuous at $c$ ([[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]]); in particular $g$ is.

[L5] At a limit point $c$ of $A$, continuity of $g$ at $c$ says exactly that $\lim_{x \to c} g(x)$ exists and equals $g(c)$ ([[def-continuity-real]], clause 1, [[def-function-limit]]).

[L6] Sign preservation ([[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]]): if $c$ is a limit point of $A$ and $\lim_{x \to c} g(x)$ exists and is nonzero, then $c$ is a limit point of $A_0 = \{x \in A : g(x) \ne 0\}$.

[L7] A product of two nonzero reals is nonzero ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]), and $g(c)^{2} = g(c)\,g(c)$ ([[def-integer-power]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L1], applied to $f$ and to $g$ on $A$ at $c$, fix $\varphi, \psi : A \to \mathbb{R}$, both continuous at $c$, with $f(x) - f(c) = \varphi(x)(x - c)$ and $g(x) - g(c) = \psi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in A$, and with $\varphi(c) = f'(c)$ and $\psi(c) = g'(c)$. [L1, choose]

1.2 Assume $g(c) \ne 0$. Then $c \in A_0$ by the definition of $A_0$; $g$ is continuous at $c$ by [L4], so $\lim_{x \to c} g(x) = g(c) \ne 0$ by [L5]; and therefore $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$ by [L6]. [L4, L5, L6]

2.1 **Sum.** For every $x \in A$, $(f+g)(x) - (f+g)(c) = \bigl(f(x)-f(c)\bigr) + \bigl(g(x)-g(c)\bigr) = \bigl(\varphi(x) + \psi(x)\bigr)(x-c)$. The function $\varphi + \psi$ is continuous at $c$ by [L2], and $(\varphi+\psi)(c) = f'(c) + g'(c)$. So [L1] gives claim 1. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.2 **Scalar multiple.** For every $x \in A$, $(\alpha f)(x) - (\alpha f)(c) = \alpha\bigl(f(x)-f(c)\bigr) = \bigl(\alpha\varphi(x)\bigr)(x-c)$. The function $\alpha\varphi$ is continuous at $c$ by [L2], with value $\alpha f'(c)$ there. So [L1] gives claim 2. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.3 **Product.** For every $x \in A$, $f(x)g(x) - f(c)g(c) = \bigl(f(x)-f(c)\bigr)g(x) + f(c)\bigl(g(x)-g(c)\bigr) = \bigl(\varphi(x)g(x) + f(c)\psi(x)\bigr)(x-c)$. Put $\chi := \varphi\,g + f(c)\,\psi$; it is continuous at $c$ by [L2], since $\varphi$, $\psi$ and (by [L4]) $g$ are, and constants are; and $\chi(c) = \varphi(c)g(c) + f(c)\psi(c) = f'(c)g(c) + f(c)g'(c)$. So [L1] gives claim 3. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L4]

2.4 **Quotient, the rearrangement.** Assume $g(c) \ne 0$ and let $x \in A_0$, so $g(x) \ne 0$ and $g(c) \ne 0$. Then $f(x)/g(x) - f(c)/g(c) = \bigl(f(x)g(c) - f(c)g(x)\bigr)/\bigl(g(x)g(c)\bigr)$, and $f(x)g(c) - f(c)g(x) = \bigl(f(x)-f(c)\bigr)g(c) - f(c)\bigl(g(x)-g(c)\bigr) = \bigl(\varphi(x)g(c) - f(c)\psi(x)\bigr)(x-c)$. So, defining $\theta : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$ by $\theta(x) := \bigl(\varphi(x)g(c) - f(c)\psi(x)\bigr)/\bigl(g(x)g(c)\bigr)$, one has $(f/g)|_{A_0}(x) - (f/g)|_{A_0}(c) = \theta(x)(x-c)$ for every $x \in A_0$. [step 1.1, L1, L7]

2.5 **Quotient, continuity of the factor.** Assume $g(c) \ne 0$. The restrictions of $\varphi$, $\psi$ and $g$ to $A_0$ are continuous at $c \in A_0$ by [L3] and [L4], so by [L2] the numerator $u(x) := \varphi(x)g(c) - f(c)\psi(x)$ and the denominator $v(x) := g(x)g(c)$ are continuous at $c$ as functions on $A_0$. By [L7] the denominator vanishes at no point of $A_0$, so $\{x \in A_0 : v(x) \ne 0\} = A_0$, and $v(c) = g(c)^{2} \ne 0$; hence claim 4 of [L2] gives that $\theta = (u/v)|_{A_0}$ is continuous at $c$, with $\theta(c) = \bigl(\varphi(c)g(c) - f(c)\psi(c)\bigr)/g(c)^{2} = \bigl(f'(c)g(c) - f(c)g'(c)\bigr)/g(c)^{2}$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L2, L3, L4, L7]

3.1 **Quotient, conclusion.** Assume $g(c) \ne 0$. By step 1.2 the point $c$ lies in $A_0$ and is a limit point of $A_0$; by steps 2.4 and 2.5 the function $\theta : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$ and factors the increment of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$. So [L1], applied on the domain $A_0$ at the point $c$, gives that $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ is differentiable at $c$ with derivative $\theta(c)$: claim 4. [step 1.2, step 2.4, step 2.5, L1]

4.1 Claims 1 to 4 are proved, by steps 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 3.1 respectively, each by exhibiting the Carathéodory factor of the new function and reading its continuity at $c$ off the algebra of continuous functions. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The product rearrangement in one line.** The identity $fg - f(c)g(c) = (f - f(c))\,g + f(c)\,(g - g(c))$ splits the increment of a product into two increments, one multiplied by $g$ and one by a constant. It is the same identity that carries the product case of [[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]], read at the level of increments rather than of $\varepsilon$; here the factor $g$ has to be continuous at $c$ rather than merely bounded near it, and [[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]] is what supplies that.

- **The reciprocal is the case $f \equiv 1$.** Claim 4 then reads $\bigl((1/g)|_{A_0}\bigr)'(c) = -g'(c)/g(c)^{2}$, since $f'(c) = 0$ for a constant $f$; nothing separate has to be proved, and the derivative of a negative integer power on this page is obtained exactly this way.

- **Two hypotheses that look removable and are not.** In claim 4 the hypothesis $g(c) \ne 0$ cannot be weakened to "$g$ is nonzero somewhere near $c$", because $c$ itself must lie in the smaller domain for a derivative there to be a statement about $c$; and the conclusion is about $(f/g)|_{A_0}$, not about any extension of it to $A$, since no such extension is canonical.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $c$ be a limit point of $A$
([[def-limit-point-r]]), let $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $\alpha \in
\mathbb{R}$. Suppose the limits of $f$ and of $g$ at $c$ exist, and write
$L := \lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ and $M := \lim_{x \to c} g(x)$
([[def-function-limit]]). Then:

1. the limit of $f + g$ at $c$ exists, and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} (f + g)(x) \;=\; \lim_{x \to c} f(x) + \lim_{x \to c} g(x) \;=\; L + M ;$$
2. the limit of $\alpha f$ at $c$ exists, and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} (\alpha f)(x) \;=\; \alpha \lim_{x \to c} f(x) \;=\; \alpha L ;$$
3. the limit of $fg$ at $c$ exists, and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} (fg)(x) \;=\; \Bigl(\lim_{x \to c} f(x)\Bigr)\Bigl(\lim_{x \to c} g(x)\Bigr) \;=\; LM ;$$
4. if $M \ne 0$, then, writing $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$, the point
   $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$, the quotient $f/g$ is defined on $A_0$ by
   $(f/g)(x) = f(x) / g(x)$, the limit of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$ exists, and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} (f/g)|_{A_0}(x) \;=\; \frac{\lim_{x \to c} f(x)}{\lim_{x \to c} g(x)} \;=\; \frac{L}{M} .$$

Each equation asserts two things at once: that the limit on the left exists, and
that it has the stated value. Both are proved. The symbols denote by
[[lem-function-limit-unique]].

**Everything below is proved directly from $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$.** No
sequence is constructed and no choice principle is used, so all four claims are
theorems of ZF. Passing through
[[thm-sequential-criterion-for-function-limits]] instead would import the
countable choice spent in that theorem's converse direction, for no gain; see
[[rem-heine-criterion-choice-cost]].

**Why the quotient is stated on $A_0$.** The function $f/g$ is simply not defined
where $g$ vanishes, and $g$ may well vanish at points of $A$ arbitrarily far from
$c$; restricting to $A_0$ is therefore forced. That this restriction still has
$c$ as a limit point, so that the limit there means anything at all, is the last
claim of [[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]]. The sequential analogue
[[thm-algebra-of-limits]] needs the corresponding hypothesis in the form "the
denominator sequence is nonzero at every index".

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a limit point $c$ of $A$, functions $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\alpha$, and reals $L, M$ with $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$ and $\lim_{x \to c} g(x) = M$; for claim 4 also $M \ne 0$ and $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$ ([[def-function-limit]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L1] The limit condition: $\lim_{x \to c} h(x) = P$ means that for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x$ in the domain of $h$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|h(x) - P| < \varepsilon$ ([[def-function-limit]]).

[L2] Absolute value: $|u| \ge 0$; $|u| = 0$ if and only if $u = 0$; $|uv| = |u|\,|v|$; and $|{-u}| = |u|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L3] Triangle inequality: $|u + v| \le |u| + |v|$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L4] Order and field arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: adding two strict inequalities ([[lem-of-add-order]]); for $t > 0$, $u < v$ is equivalent to $ut < vt$, and $0 \le u \le v$ with $0 \le s \le t$ gives $us \le vt$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]); positive elements have positive inverses and $0 < a < b$ gives $0 < 1/b < 1/a$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]); $0 < 1$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]), so $2 > 0$ and $t/2 > 0$ for $t > 0$; inverses and the field identities ([[def-field]]); trichotomy and totality, so of finitely many positive reals the smallest is positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] Local boundedness: there are a real $\delta_0 > 0$ and a real $K \ge 0$ with $|f(x)| \le K$ for every $x \in A$ satisfying $0 < |x - c| < \delta_0$ ([[lem-limit-implies-local-boundedness]]).

[L6] Sign preservation: if $M \ne 0$ there is a real $\delta_s > 0$ with $|g(x)| > |M|/2 > 0$ for every $x \in A$ satisfying $0 < |x - c| < \delta_s$, and $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$ ([[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]]).

[L7] Restriction: if $B \subseteq A$ has $c$ as a limit point and $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$, then $\lim_{x \to c} f|_B(x) = L$ (claim 2 of [[lem-limit-is-local]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Sum.** Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real. By [L1] fix reals $\delta_1, \delta_2 > 0$ with $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon/2$ for every $x \in A$ satisfying $0 < |x - c| < \delta_1$ and $|g(x) - M| < \varepsilon/2$ for every $x \in A$ satisfying $0 < |x - c| < \delta_2$, and let $\delta$ be the smaller of the two, so $\delta > 0$. For $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ we get $|(f+g)(x) - (L+M)| = |(f(x) - L) + (g(x) - M)| \le |f(x) - L| + |g(x) - M| < \varepsilon$. As $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary, the limit of $f + g$ at $c$ exists and equals $L + M$: claim 1. [L1, L2, L3, L4, choose]

1.2 **Scalar multiple.** If $\alpha = 0$ then $\alpha f$ is the constant function $0$ and $\alpha L = 0$, so $|(\alpha f)(x) - \alpha L| = 0 < \varepsilon$ for every $x$ and every $\varepsilon > 0$, any $\delta$ serving. If $\alpha \ne 0$ then $|\alpha| > 0$; given a real $\varepsilon > 0$, [L1] supplies $\delta > 0$ with $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon/|\alpha|$ on $A \cap N^{*}_{\delta}(c)$, and there $|(\alpha f)(x) - \alpha L| = |\alpha|\,|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$. So the limit of $\alpha f$ at $c$ exists and equals $\alpha L$: claim 2. [L1, L2, L4, L8, choose]

1.3 **A working bound for $f$ near $c$.** By [L5] fix a real $\delta_0 > 0$ and a real $K \ge 0$ with $|f(x)| \le K$ for every $x \in A$ satisfying $0 < |x - c| < \delta_0$, and put $K' := K + 1$, so $K' > 0$ and $|f(x)| \le K'$ for all those $x$. [L4, L5, choose]

1.4 **The denominator near $c$.** Assume $M \ne 0$. By [L6] fix a real $\delta_s > 0$ with $|g(x)| > |M|/2 > 0$ for every $x \in A$ satisfying $0 < |x - c| < \delta_s$; every such $x$ has $g(x) \ne 0$, hence lies in $A_0$, and $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$. [L2, L4, L6]

2.1 **Product.** Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real. By [L1] fix reals $\delta_1, \delta_2 > 0$ with $|g(x) - M| < \varepsilon/(2K')$ on $A \cap N^{*}_{\delta_1}(c)$ and $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon / \bigl(2(|M| + 1)\bigr)$ on $A \cap N^{*}_{\delta_2}(c)$, and let $\delta$ be the smallest of $\delta_0, \delta_1, \delta_2$, which is positive. For $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, $|f(x)g(x) - LM| = |f(x)(g(x) - M) + M(f(x) - L)| \le |f(x)|\,|g(x) - M| + |M|\,|f(x) - L| \le K'\,|g(x) - M| + (|M|+1)\,|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$. As $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary, the limit of $fg$ at $c$ exists and equals $LM$: claim 3. [step 1.3, L1, L2, L3, L4, L8, choose]

2.2 **Reciprocal.** Assume $M \ne 0$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real. By [L1] fix a real $\delta_3 > 0$ with $|g(x) - M| < \varepsilon |M|^2 / 2$ on $A \cap N^{*}_{\delta_3}(c)$, and let $\delta$ be the smaller of $\delta_s$ and $\delta_3$. For $x \in A_0$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ we have $|g(x)| > |M|/2 > 0$, hence $|g(x)|\,|M| > |M|^2/2 > 0$ and so $1/(|g(x)|\,|M|) < 2/|M|^2$; therefore $\bigl| 1/g(x) - 1/M \bigr| = |M - g(x)| \big/ \bigl(|g(x)|\,|M|\bigr) < (\varepsilon |M|^2/2)\cdot(2/|M|^2) = \varepsilon$. As $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary, the limit of $(1/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$ exists and equals $1/M$. [step 1.4, L1, L2, L4, L8, choose]

2.3 **The numerator on the smaller domain.** Assume $M \ne 0$. Since $A_0 \subseteq A$ and $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$ by step 1.4, [L7] gives that the limit of $f|_{A_0}$ at $c$ exists and equals $L$. [step 1.4, L7]

3.1 **Quotient.** Assume $M \ne 0$. On the domain $A_0$, which has $c$ as a limit point, the two functions $f|_{A_0}$ and $(1/g)|_{A_0}$ have limits $L$ and $1/M$ at $c$ by steps 2.3 and 2.2, and their product is $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ by the field identities; so claim 3, applied on the domain $A_0$, gives that the limit of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$ exists and equals $L \cdot (1/M) = L/M$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, L2, L4]

4.1 Claims 1 to 4 are proved, each directly from the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ definition and none of them through a sequence. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.1, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The product estimate in one line.** The identity $fg - LM = f\,(g - M) + M\,(f - L)$ turns the problem into two products, one with a factor that is merely bounded near $c$ (that is $f$, and [[lem-limit-implies-local-boundedness]] is what bounds it) and one with a constant factor. The two constants $K'$ and $|M| + 1$ are used in place of $K$ and $|M|$ only so that they are strictly positive and may be divided by; that is the sole reason for adding $1$.

- **The reciprocal estimate in one line.** The identity $1/g - 1/M = (M - g)/(gM)$ turns the problem into a numerator that is small and a denominator that must be kept away from $0$; the lower bound $|g| > |M|/2$ from [[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]] does exactly that, and gives the working factor $2/|M|^2$.

- **Nothing here extends to $\pm\infty$.** The statement is about a finite limit point $c$ and finite values $L, M$; [[def-limits-at-infinity]] introduces limits at and to infinity, but no algebra of such limits is proved in this library, and none may be assumed. The companion page's limit at $+\infty$ is computed by a direct estimate for precisely that reason.

- **The sequential analogue** is [[thm-algebra-of-limits]]. Neither implies the other for free: this theorem is about a function on a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ and is proved from $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$; that one is about sequences.

## Statement

Let $c\in\mathbb R$ and let $f,g$ be differentiable on a deleted one-sided or two-sided neighbourhood of $c$, with $g'\ne0$ there. Suppose $f(x)\to0$, $g(x)\to0$ as $x\to c$ in the chosen mode. If $f'(x)/g'(x)\to L\in\overline{\mathbb R}$, then $f(x)/g(x)\to L$ in the same mode. The analogous statement at $+\infty$ or $-\infty$ follows after the substitution $t=1/x$, wherever the transformed functions are defined.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The hypotheses and one fixed approach mode.

[L1] Differentiability implies continuity, and the Cauchy quotient lemma gives a point between two arguments at which a secant quotient equals a derivative quotient ([[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]], [[lem-cauchy-mean-value-quotient-form]]).

[L2] Finite and infinite function limits have the quantified meanings in [[def-function-limit]], [[def-one-sided-limits]], [[def-limits-at-infinity]], and [[def-extended-reals]].

[L3] Composition with $t=1/x$ is licensed by the chain rule, and ordinary finite limits obey their algebra laws ([[thm-chain-rule]], [[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]], [[thm-algebra-of-derivatives]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Extend $f,g$ to $c$ by $f(c)=g(c)=0$. Their continuity at $c$ follows from the assumed zero limits, while differentiability gives continuity at every other point of the segment. For $x\ne c$ sufficiently close, the quotient lemma on the segment with endpoints $c,x$ gives $\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\frac{f'(\xi_x)}{g'(\xi_x)}$, where $\xi_x$ lies strictly between $c$ and $x$.  [given, L1, L2]

2.1 As $x\to c$ in the chosen mode, $\xi_x\to c$ in that mode. Applying the defining finite or infinite limit inequality to the derivative quotient therefore gives $f(x)/g(x)\to L$.  [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 At infinity, put $F(t)=f(1/t)$, $G(t)=g(1/t)$. Then $F'/G'=f'(1/t)/g'(1/t)$, since the common factor $-1/t^2$ cancels. Apply steps 1.1 and 2.1 as $t\to0^+$ or $0^-$, and translate back.  [L3, step 2.1, algebra] ∎
