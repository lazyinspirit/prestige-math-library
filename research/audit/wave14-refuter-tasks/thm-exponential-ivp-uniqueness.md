## Statement

If $y:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ is differentiable, $y'=y$, and $y(0)=1$, then $y=\exp$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A differentiable solution $y$ of the initial-value problem.

[L1] $\exp'=\exp$, $\exp(-x)=1/\exp(x)$, and the series definition gives $\exp(0)=1$ ([[thm-derivative-of-exponential]], [[cor-exponential-reciprocal-and-positivity]], [[def-real-exponential-function-and-e]]).

[L2] Products and composites satisfy [[thm-algebra-of-derivatives]] and [[thm-chain-rule]].

[L3] Differentiability implies continuity, and a continuous function with zero derivative on an interval is constant ([[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]], [[cor-zero-derivative-implies-constant]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Define $h(x)=y(x)\exp(-x)$. By [L1] and [L2], $h'(x)=y'(x)\exp(-x)-y(x)\exp(-x)=0$.  [given, L1, L2]

2.1 The differentiable function $h$ is continuous, so [L3] makes it constant; $h(0)=y(0)\exp(0)=1$.  [step 1.1, L1, L3]

3.1 Thus $y(x)\exp(-x)=1$, and multiplying by $\exp(x)$ gives $y(x)=\exp(x)$.  [step 2.1, L1, algebra] ∎

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$ be a
limit point of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]). If $f$ is differentiable at $c$
([[def-derivative]]) then $f$ is continuous at $c$ ([[def-continuity-real]]).

Consequently, if $f$ is differentiable on a set $S \subseteq A$ then $f$ is
continuous at every point of $S$.

**No converse is asserted, and none holds.** Continuity at $c$ does not give
differentiability at $c$, and the standard witness is worked out on the
companion page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and a point $c \in A$ that is a limit point of $A$ at which $f$ is differentiable ([[def-derivative]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L1] Carathéodory's characterisation ([[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]]): since $f$ is differentiable at the limit point $c$ of $A$, there is $\varphi : A \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $c$, with $f(x) - f(c) = \varphi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in A$, and $\varphi(c) = f'(c)$.

[L2] Algebra of continuous functions ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]]): sums, scalar multiples and products of functions continuous at a point of the common domain are continuous there (claim 1); and every constant function on $A$ and the identity $x \mapsto x$ on $A$ are continuous at every point of $A$ (claim 5).

[L3] Continuity of $f$ at $c$ is the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ condition of [[def-continuity-real]], and continuity on a set is continuity at each of its points.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Fix a function $\varphi : A \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $c$, with $f(x) - f(c) = \varphi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in A$. [L1, choose]

1.2 The identity $x \mapsto x$ on $A$ and every constant function on $A$ are continuous at $c$; hence so is $x \mapsto x - c$, which is the sum of the identity and the constant function with value $-c$. [L2]

2.1 The pointwise product $x \mapsto \varphi(x)(x - c)$ is continuous at $c$, being the product of two functions on $A$ continuous at $c$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L2]

3.1 For every $x \in A$ one has $f(x) = f(c) + \varphi(x)(x - c)$, so $f$ is the sum of the constant function with value $f(c)$ and the product of step 2.1. [step 1.1, L1]

4.1 A sum of two functions continuous at $c$ is continuous at $c$, so $f$ is continuous at $c$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L2, L3]

5.1 The point $c$ was an arbitrary point of $A$, a limit point of $A$, at which $f$ is differentiable; applying step 4.1 at every point of a set $S \subseteq A$ on which $f$ is differentiable gives continuity of $f$ at every point of $S$. [step 3.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the work actually is.** None of it is here. Carathéodory's characterisation already replaces the quotient by a product, and a product is visibly small when one factor is bounded near $c$ and the other tends to $0$; the algebra of continuous functions packages exactly that. A direct proof from the quotient would multiply and divide by $x - c$ and would have to say why that is legal, which is the same observation in a less convenient place.

- **The converse fails.** $x \mapsto |x|$ is continuous at $0$ and not differentiable there, which is [[cex-absolute-value-is-not-differentiable-at-zero]] on the companion page. So continuity is strictly weaker, and the gap is not exotic: it opens at a single corner.

- **What is *not* claimed.** Nothing here says that a function differentiable on a set has a continuous derivative, and nothing here says that $f'$ is defined anywhere except where it was assumed to be. Both are separate questions, and neither is settled on this page.

## Statement

For every real $x$, $\exp(x)>0$ and
$$\exp(-x)=\frac1{\exp(x)}.$$

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $x\in\mathbb R$.

[L1] $\exp(x+y)=\exp(x)\exp(y)$ ([[thm-exponential-addition-formula]]), and $\exp(0)=1$ from [[def-real-exponential-function-and-e]].

[L2] Every nonzero square in an ordered field is positive ([[lem-of-square-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Setting $y=-x$ in [L1] gives $\exp(x)\exp(-x)=1$, so both factors are nonzero.  [L1, algebra]

2.1 Also $\exp(x)=\exp(x/2)^2$, so it is nonnegative; by step 1.1 and [L2] it is positive.  [L1, L2]

3.1 Dividing the identity in step 1.1 by $\exp(x)$ gives the reciprocal formula.  [step 1.1, algebra] ∎

## Statement

Let $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be order-convex ([[def-interval]]) and let
$f : I \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $I$ ([[def-continuity-real]]) and
differentiable at every point of $I$ that is interior to $I$
([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[def-derivative]]), with

$$f'(x) = 0 \qquad \text{at every interior point } x \text{ of } I .$$

Then $f$ is constant on $I$: there is a real $k$ with $f(x) = k$ for every
$x \in I$.

Consequently, if $f, g : I \to \mathbb{R}$ are both continuous on $I$ and both
differentiable at every interior point of $I$, with $f'(x) = g'(x)$ at every
interior point $x$, then there is a real $k$ with

$$f(x) \;=\; g(x) + k \qquad \text{for every } x \in I .$$

**Order-convexity of $I$ is essential and is not a convenience.** The
conclusion is false on a domain that falls into separate pieces, since a
function may be constant on each piece with different constants; nothing in the
proof would survive, because the mean value theorem is applied to the segment
joining two points of the domain and that segment must lie in the domain.

**The hypothesis is imposed only at interior points.** At an endpoint of $I$
nothing is asked at all: $f$ need not be differentiable there, and the proof
never evaluates a difference quotient at an endpoint, since it applies the mean
value theorem on a segment $[u,v] \subseteq I$ and uses the derivative only at
points of $(u,v)$, all of which are interior to $I$. What is *not* meant is that
the derivative at an endpoint is free to be nonzero: once $f$ is known to be
constant its difference quotient at an endpoint is constantly $0$, so wherever
$f'$ exists at an endpoint it is $0$ too. That is a consequence of the theorem,
not a hypothesis of it.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An order-convex $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a function $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous on $I$ and differentiable with vanishing derivative at every interior point of $I$; for the second claim also a second such function $g$ with $f' = g'$ at every interior point.

[L1] Mean value theorem ([[cor-mean-value-theorem]]): for $u < v$ and $h : [u,v] \to \mathbb{R}$ continuous on $[u,v]$ and differentiable at every point of $(u,v)$, there is $c \in (u,v)$ with $h(v) - h(u) = h'(c)(v-u)$.

[L2] Order-convexity ([[def-interval]]): if $u, v \in I$ and $u \le z \le v$ then $z \in I$; so $u, v \in I$ with $u \le v$ gives $[u,v] \subseteq I$.

[L3] For $u < v$ in $I$ and $x \in (u,v)$, the point $x$ is interior to $I$: put $\varepsilon := \min\{x - u,\ v - x\}$, a positive real; every $y$ with $|y - x| < \varepsilon$ satisfies $u < y < v$, so $N_{\varepsilon}(x) \subseteq (u,v) \subseteq [u,v] \subseteq I$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L4] Restriction of the domain ([[def-derivative]]): if $B \subseteq A$, if $p \in B$ is a limit point of $B$ and if $h : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is differentiable at $p$, then $h|_B$ is differentiable at $p$ with $(h|_B)'(p) = h'(p)$. Moreover every point of an order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ with at least two elements is a limit point of it ([[def-derivative]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L5] Continuity passes to a subset of the domain: if $B \subseteq A$ and $h : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $p \in B$, then $h|_B$ is continuous at $p$ ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L6] Algebra ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], claim 1, and [[thm-algebra-of-derivatives]], claims 1 and 2): sums and scalar multiples of functions continuous at a point are continuous there, and sums and scalar multiples of functions differentiable at a limit point of the common domain are differentiable there, with the corresponding derivatives.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 If $I$ has at most one element then $f$ is constant on $I$ and there is nothing to prove, the second claim following likewise. So assume $I$ has at least two elements and let $u, v \in I$ with $u < v$ be arbitrary. [given, L2]

2.1 By [L2] the segment $[u,v]$ is contained in $I$, and $u < v$, so $[u,v]$ is a nondegenerate interval. The restriction $f|_{[u,v]}$ is continuous on $[u,v]$ by [L5]. [step 1.1, L2, L5]

2.2 Let $x \in (u,v)$. By [L3] the point $x$ is interior to $I$, so $f$ is differentiable at $x$ with $f'(x) = 0$ by hypothesis. By [L4] the point $x$ is a limit point of $[u,v]$, so $f|_{[u,v]}$ is differentiable at $x$ with $(f|_{[u,v]})'(x) = f'(x) = 0$. [step 1.1, L3, L4]

3.1 By steps 2.1 and 2.2 the function $f|_{[u,v]}$ satisfies the hypotheses of [L1] on $[u,v]$, so there is $c \in (u,v)$ with $f(v) - f(u) = (f|_{[u,v]})'(c)\,(v-u) = 0 \cdot (v-u) = 0$. Hence $f(u) = f(v)$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L1]

4.1 Any two distinct points of $I$ can be named $u$ and $v$ with $u < v$, and step 3.1 then gives $f(u) = f(v)$; at a single point the equality is trivial. So $f$ takes one and the same value at every point of $I$, and $f$ is constant on $I$. [step 1.1, step 3.1]

5.1 **Second claim.** Put $h := f + (-1)g$, so $h(x) = f(x) - g(x)$ on $I$. By [L6] the function $h$ is continuous on $I$. If $I$ has at most one element the claim is trivial; otherwise every point of $I$ is a limit point of $I$ by [L4], so at every interior point $x$ of $I$ the sum rule of [L6] applies and gives that $h$ is differentiable at $x$ with $h'(x) = f'(x) - g'(x) = 0$. By step 4.1, applied to $h$ in place of $f$, the function $h$ is constant on $I$; writing $k$ for its value, $f(x) = g(x) + k$ for every $x \in I$. [step 4.1, L4, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- **What is really being used.** Only that any two points of $I$ are joined by a segment inside $I$, and that on such a segment the mean value theorem turns a vanishing derivative into a vanishing increment. Both facts are about $I$, not about $f$, which is why order-convexity is the hypothesis and not, say, openness or connectedness in some other sense.

- **The second claim is the uniqueness half of antidifferentiation.** It says that a function on an interval is determined by its derivative up to one additive constant. It says nothing about existence: that some given function *is* a derivative is a separate question, settled by different machinery, and this page does not address it.

- **A vanishing derivative at every interior point is far stronger than a vanishing derivative somewhere.** The theorem consumes the hypothesis at every point of a segment at once; a single stationary point carries no information about $f$ anywhere else, which is what [[thm-fermat-interior-extremum]] already made clear from the other side.

## Definition

For $x\in\mathbb R$, define
$$\exp(x):=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^n}{\iota(n!)}, \qquad e:=\exp(1),$$
provided by the all-real convergence proved in [[lem-exponential-series-has-infinite-radius]]. Here $n!\in\mathbb N$ is the factorial of [[def-factorial-and-falling-factorial]], $\iota(n!)$ is its nonzero real image ([[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]), and powers and series are those of [[def-integer-power]] and [[def-series]].

This is a real power series centred at $0$ ([[def-real-power-series-and-radius-of-convergence]]). No logarithm, irrational power, or differential equation enters the definition.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $c \in A$ be a limit point of $A$
([[def-limit-point-r]]), let $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ be differentiable at $c$
([[def-derivative]]) and let $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$. Then:

1. $f + g$ is differentiable at $c$ and $(f+g)'(c) = f'(c) + g'(c)$;
2. $\alpha f$ is differentiable at $c$ and $(\alpha f)'(c) = \alpha f'(c)$;
3. $fg$ is differentiable at $c$ and $(fg)'(c) = f'(c)g(c) + f(c)g'(c)$;
4. if $g(c) \ne 0$ then, writing $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$, the
   point $c$ lies in $A_0$ and is a limit point of $A_0$, the quotient
   $(f/g)|_{A_0} : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$, $x \mapsto f(x)/g(x)$, is differentiable
   at $c$ as a function on $A_0$, and
   $$\bigl((f/g)|_{A_0}\bigr)'(c) \;=\; \frac{f'(c)\,g(c) - f(c)\,g'(c)}{g(c)^{2}} .$$

Each claim asserts two things: that the derivative on the left exists, and that
it has the stated value. Both are proved.

**Why claim 4 is stated on $A_0$.** The function $f/g$ is not defined where $g$
vanishes, and $g$ may vanish at points of $A$ far from $c$; restricting to $A_0$
is forced. That the restriction still has $c$ as a limit point, so that a
derivative there means anything at all, is not free either, and it is the last
claim of [[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]] applied to $g$. The hypothesis
is $g(c) \ne 0$, not "$g$ vanishes nowhere".

**Everything is proved through
[[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]].** No difference quotient is estimated and
no limit theorem beyond continuity is used, so no choice principle is spent.
The four identities are four algebraic rearrangements of an increment, each
followed by a reading of [[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a point $c \in A$ that is a limit point of $A$, functions $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ differentiable at $c$, and a real $\alpha$; for claim 4 also the hypothesis $g(c) \ne 0$ together with $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$ ([[def-derivative]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L1] Carathéodory's characterisation ([[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]]), used in both directions: for a set $B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a point $p \in B$ that is a limit point of $B$ and a function $h : B \to \mathbb{R}$, the function $h$ is differentiable at $p$ if and only if there is $\eta : B \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $p$, with $h(x) - h(p) = \eta(x)(x - p)$ for every $x \in B$, and then $\eta(p) = h'(p)$.

[L2] Algebra of continuous functions ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]]): sums, scalar multiples and products of functions continuous at a point are continuous there (claim 1); every constant function and the identity are continuous everywhere on the domain (claim 5); and if $u, v$ are continuous at a point $p$ of their common domain $D$ with $v(p) \ne 0$, then $p$ lies in $D_0 := \{x \in D : v(x) \ne 0\}$ and $(u/v)|_{D_0}$ is continuous at $p$ as a function on $D_0$ (claim 4).

[L3] Continuity passes to a subset of the domain: if $B \subseteq A$, if $p \in B$ and if $\psi : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $p$, then $\psi|_B$ is continuous at $p$, the condition on the restriction quantifying over fewer points ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L4] A function differentiable at $c$ is continuous at $c$ ([[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]]); in particular $g$ is.

[L5] At a limit point $c$ of $A$, continuity of $g$ at $c$ says exactly that $\lim_{x \to c} g(x)$ exists and equals $g(c)$ ([[def-continuity-real]], clause 1, [[def-function-limit]]).

[L6] Sign preservation ([[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]]): if $c$ is a limit point of $A$ and $\lim_{x \to c} g(x)$ exists and is nonzero, then $c$ is a limit point of $A_0 = \{x \in A : g(x) \ne 0\}$.

[L7] A product of two nonzero reals is nonzero ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]), and $g(c)^{2} = g(c)\,g(c)$ ([[def-integer-power]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L1], applied to $f$ and to $g$ on $A$ at $c$, fix $\varphi, \psi : A \to \mathbb{R}$, both continuous at $c$, with $f(x) - f(c) = \varphi(x)(x - c)$ and $g(x) - g(c) = \psi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in A$, and with $\varphi(c) = f'(c)$ and $\psi(c) = g'(c)$. [L1, choose]

1.2 Assume $g(c) \ne 0$. Then $c \in A_0$ by the definition of $A_0$; $g$ is continuous at $c$ by [L4], so $\lim_{x \to c} g(x) = g(c) \ne 0$ by [L5]; and therefore $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$ by [L6]. [L4, L5, L6]

2.1 **Sum.** For every $x \in A$, $(f+g)(x) - (f+g)(c) = \bigl(f(x)-f(c)\bigr) + \bigl(g(x)-g(c)\bigr) = \bigl(\varphi(x) + \psi(x)\bigr)(x-c)$. The function $\varphi + \psi$ is continuous at $c$ by [L2], and $(\varphi+\psi)(c) = f'(c) + g'(c)$. So [L1] gives claim 1. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.2 **Scalar multiple.** For every $x \in A$, $(\alpha f)(x) - (\alpha f)(c) = \alpha\bigl(f(x)-f(c)\bigr) = \bigl(\alpha\varphi(x)\bigr)(x-c)$. The function $\alpha\varphi$ is continuous at $c$ by [L2], with value $\alpha f'(c)$ there. So [L1] gives claim 2. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.3 **Product.** For every $x \in A$, $f(x)g(x) - f(c)g(c) = \bigl(f(x)-f(c)\bigr)g(x) + f(c)\bigl(g(x)-g(c)\bigr) = \bigl(\varphi(x)g(x) + f(c)\psi(x)\bigr)(x-c)$. Put $\chi := \varphi\,g + f(c)\,\psi$; it is continuous at $c$ by [L2], since $\varphi$, $\psi$ and (by [L4]) $g$ are, and constants are; and $\chi(c) = \varphi(c)g(c) + f(c)\psi(c) = f'(c)g(c) + f(c)g'(c)$. So [L1] gives claim 3. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L4]

2.4 **Quotient, the rearrangement.** Assume $g(c) \ne 0$ and let $x \in A_0$, so $g(x) \ne 0$ and $g(c) \ne 0$. Then $f(x)/g(x) - f(c)/g(c) = \bigl(f(x)g(c) - f(c)g(x)\bigr)/\bigl(g(x)g(c)\bigr)$, and $f(x)g(c) - f(c)g(x) = \bigl(f(x)-f(c)\bigr)g(c) - f(c)\bigl(g(x)-g(c)\bigr) = \bigl(\varphi(x)g(c) - f(c)\psi(x)\bigr)(x-c)$. So, defining $\theta : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$ by $\theta(x) := \bigl(\varphi(x)g(c) - f(c)\psi(x)\bigr)/\bigl(g(x)g(c)\bigr)$, one has $(f/g)|_{A_0}(x) - (f/g)|_{A_0}(c) = \theta(x)(x-c)$ for every $x \in A_0$. [step 1.1, L1, L7]

2.5 **Quotient, continuity of the factor.** Assume $g(c) \ne 0$. The restrictions of $\varphi$, $\psi$ and $g$ to $A_0$ are continuous at $c \in A_0$ by [L3] and [L4], so by [L2] the numerator $u(x) := \varphi(x)g(c) - f(c)\psi(x)$ and the denominator $v(x) := g(x)g(c)$ are continuous at $c$ as functions on $A_0$. By [L7] the denominator vanishes at no point of $A_0$, so $\{x \in A_0 : v(x) \ne 0\} = A_0$, and $v(c) = g(c)^{2} \ne 0$; hence claim 4 of [L2] gives that $\theta = (u/v)|_{A_0}$ is continuous at $c$, with $\theta(c) = \bigl(\varphi(c)g(c) - f(c)\psi(c)\bigr)/g(c)^{2} = \bigl(f'(c)g(c) - f(c)g'(c)\bigr)/g(c)^{2}$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L2, L3, L4, L7]

3.1 **Quotient, conclusion.** Assume $g(c) \ne 0$. By step 1.2 the point $c$ lies in $A_0$ and is a limit point of $A_0$; by steps 2.4 and 2.5 the function $\theta : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$ and factors the increment of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$. So [L1], applied on the domain $A_0$ at the point $c$, gives that $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ is differentiable at $c$ with derivative $\theta(c)$: claim 4. [step 1.2, step 2.4, step 2.5, L1]

4.1 Claims 1 to 4 are proved, by steps 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 3.1 respectively, each by exhibiting the Carathéodory factor of the new function and reading its continuity at $c$ off the algebra of continuous functions. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The product rearrangement in one line.** The identity $fg - f(c)g(c) = (f - f(c))\,g + f(c)\,(g - g(c))$ splits the increment of a product into two increments, one multiplied by $g$ and one by a constant. It is the same identity that carries the product case of [[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]], read at the level of increments rather than of $\varepsilon$; here the factor $g$ has to be continuous at $c$ rather than merely bounded near it, and [[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]] is what supplies that.

- **The reciprocal is the case $f \equiv 1$.** Claim 4 then reads $\bigl((1/g)|_{A_0}\bigr)'(c) = -g'(c)/g(c)^{2}$, since $f'(c) = 0$ for a constant $f$; nothing separate has to be proved, and the derivative of a negative integer power on this page is obtained exactly this way.

- **Two hypotheses that look removable and are not.** In claim 4 the hypothesis $g(c) \ne 0$ cannot be weakened to "$g$ is nonzero somewhere near $c$", because $c$ itself must lie in the smaller domain for a derivative there to be a statement about $c$; and the conclusion is about $(f/g)|_{A_0}$, not about any extension of it to $A$, since no such extension is canonical.

## Statement

Let $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ with
$g[A] \subseteq B$ and let $f : B \to \mathbb{R}$, so that the composite
$f \circ g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is defined. Let $c \in A$ be a limit point of
$A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]) at which $g$ is differentiable
([[def-derivative]]), put $b := g(c)$, and suppose $b$ is a limit point of $B$
at which $f$ is differentiable. Then $f \circ g$ is differentiable at $c$ and

$$(f \circ g)'(c) \;=\; f'\bigl(g(c)\bigr)\,g'(c) .$$

**Both limit-point hypotheses are needed, and neither is automatic.** That $c$
is a limit point of $A$ is what makes $g'(c)$ and $(f \circ g)'(c)$ defined
symbols; that $b = g(c)$ is a limit point of $B$ is what makes $f'(b)$ one.
Nothing forces the second: $g$ may be differentiable at $c$ and send $c$ to an
isolated point of $B$, and there $f'(b)$ is not defined and the formula asserts
nothing.

**No case analysis appears anywhere.** The naive difference-quotient proof
writes $\frac{f(g(x)) - f(g(c))}{g(x) - g(c)} \cdot \frac{g(x) - g(c)}{x - c}$
and then has to say what happens where $g(x) = g(c)$, which may occur at points
arbitrarily close to $c$. Carathéodory's factorisation never divides by the
inner increment, so the difficulty does not arise.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sets $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, functions $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ with $g[A] \subseteq B$ and $f : B \to \mathbb{R}$, a point $c \in A$ that is a limit point of $A$ at which $g$ is differentiable, and the point $b := g(c) \in B$, a limit point of $B$ at which $f$ is differentiable ([[def-derivative]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L1] Carathéodory's characterisation ([[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]]), used in both directions: for $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a point $p \in D$ that is a limit point of $D$ and $h : D \to \mathbb{R}$, the function $h$ is differentiable at $p$ if and only if there is $\eta : D \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $p$, with $h(y) - h(p) = \eta(y)(y - p)$ for every $y \in D$, and then $\eta(p) = h'(p)$.

[L2] Algebra of continuous functions ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], claim 1): a product of two functions continuous at a point of their common domain is continuous there.

[L3] Composition of continuous functions ([[thm-composition-of-continuous-functions]]): if $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ has $g[A] \subseteq B$ and is continuous at $c \in A$, and if $\eta : B \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $g(c)$, then $\eta \circ g$ is continuous at $c$ ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L4] A function differentiable at a point is continuous there ([[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L1], applied to $g$ on $A$ at $c$, fix $\psi : A \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $c$, with $g(x) - g(c) = \psi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in A$ and $\psi(c) = g'(c)$. [L1, choose]

1.2 By [L1], applied to $f$ on $B$ at $b$, fix $\varphi : B \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $b$, with $f(y) - f(b) = \varphi(y)(y - b)$ for every $y \in B$ and $\varphi(b) = f'(b)$. [L1, choose]

2.1 **The factorisation.** Let $x \in A$. Then $g(x) \in B$, so taking $y := g(x)$ in step 1.2 gives $f(g(x)) - f(b) = \varphi(g(x))\bigl(g(x) - b\bigr)$, and $g(x) - b = g(x) - g(c) = \psi(x)(x-c)$ by step 1.1. Since $(f \circ g)(c) = f(g(c)) = f(b)$, this reads $(f \circ g)(x) - (f \circ g)(c) = \chi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in A$, where $\chi : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is the pointwise product $\chi := (\varphi \circ g)\,\psi$. [step 1.1, step 1.2]

2.2 **The outer factor is continuous at $c$.** By [L4] the function $g$ is continuous at $c$; by step 1.2 the function $\varphi$ is continuous at $b = g(c)$; and $g[A] \subseteq B$. So $\varphi \circ g$ is continuous at $c$ by [L3]. [step 1.2, L3, L4]

3.1 **The factor is continuous at $c$, with the right value.** $\chi$ is the product of $\varphi \circ g$, continuous at $c$ by step 2.2, with $\psi$, continuous at $c$ by step 1.1, so $\chi$ is continuous at $c$ by [L2]; and $\chi(c) = \varphi(g(c))\,\psi(c) = \varphi(b)\,\psi(c) = f'(b)\,g'(c)$. [step 1.1, step 2.2, L2]

4.1 By step 2.1 the function $\chi : A \to \mathbb{R}$ factors the increment of $f \circ g$ at $c$, and by step 3.1 it is continuous at $c$. So [L1], applied to $f \circ g$ on $A$ at the limit point $c$, gives that $f \circ g$ is differentiable at $c$ with $(f \circ g)'(c) = \chi(c) = f'(g(c))\,g'(c)$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the classical proof goes wrong, precisely.** It divides by $g(x) - g(c)$, which may vanish at points arbitrarily close to $c$ even when $g$ is differentiable at $c$ with $g'(c) = 0$; the usual repair defines an auxiliary function equal to the outer quotient off the bad set and to $f'(b)$ on it, and then proves that auxiliary function continuous. That auxiliary function is $\varphi \circ g$, and [[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]] is the observation that it exists before any repair is attempted.

- **What is composed is continuity, not differentiability.** The only theorem about composites used above is [[thm-composition-of-continuous-functions]], and it needs no side hypothesis, unlike the corresponding statement for limits. That is the whole reason the proof has no cases.

- **The formula is about the point $g(c)$, not about $g$ near $c$.** Both derivatives on the right are taken at single points, and the theorem says nothing about $f$ on the image of any neighbourhood of $c$. In particular no hypothesis is placed on $g[A]$ beyond its lying in $B$.

## Statement

The real exponential function is $C^\infty$, and for every $m\in\mathbb N$,
$$\exp^{(m)}=\exp.$$
In particular $(\exp)'=\exp$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The exponential power series.

[L1] A real power series may be differentiated termwise inside its radius ([[thm-termwise-differentiation-of-a-real-power-series]]), and its sum is smooth there ([[cor-power-series-sums-are-smooth-with-coefficient-formula]]).

[L2] The radius is infinite, $(n+1)!=(n+1)n!$, and the canonical embedding preserves products and sends positive naturals to nonzero reals ([[lem-exponential-series-has-infinite-radius]], [[def-factorial-and-falling-factorial]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Termwise differentiation gives $(\exp)'(x)=\sum_{n\ge1}\iota(n)x^{n-1}/\iota(n!)$.  [L1, L2]

2.1 Reindex $n=j+1$ and cancel $\iota(j+1)$ using the factorial recurrence. The series becomes $\sum_{j\ge0}x^j/\iota(j!)=\exp(x)$.  [step 1.1, L2, algebra]

3.1 Smoothness follows from [L1] and the infinite radius; iterating step 2.1 gives every higher derivative.  [step 2.1, L1, L2] ∎
