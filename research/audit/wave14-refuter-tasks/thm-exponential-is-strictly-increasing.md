## Statement

The exponential function is continuous and strictly increasing on $\mathbb R$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The exponential function.

[L1] Its derivative equals itself ([[thm-derivative-of-exponential]]) and it is everywhere positive ([[cor-exponential-reciprocal-and-positivity]]).

[L2] The mean value theorem applies to a continuous function on a closed interval and converts a positive interior derivative into strict increase ([[cor-mean-value-theorem]]). A power-series sum is continuous at every point strictly inside its convergence interval, and the exponential series has infinite radius ([[cor-power-series-sums-are-continuous]], [[lem-exponential-series-has-infinite-radius]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 If $x<y$, the mean value theorem gives $\exp(y)-\exp(x)=\exp(c)(y-x)$ for some $c\in(x,y)$.  [L1, L2]

2.1 Both factors on the right are positive, so $\exp(y)>\exp(x)$. Continuity is the cited power-series conclusion.  [step 1.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Statement

For every real $x$, $\exp(x)>0$ and
$$\exp(-x)=\frac1{\exp(x)}.$$

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $x\in\mathbb R$.

[L1] $\exp(x+y)=\exp(x)\exp(y)$ ([[thm-exponential-addition-formula]]), and $\exp(0)=1$ from [[def-real-exponential-function-and-e]].

[L2] Every nonzero square in an ordered field is positive ([[lem-of-square-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Setting $y=-x$ in [L1] gives $\exp(x)\exp(-x)=1$, so both factors are nonzero.  [L1, algebra]

2.1 Also $\exp(x)=\exp(x/2)^2$, so it is nonnegative; by step 1.1 and [L2] it is positive.  [L1, L2]

3.1 Dividing the identity in step 1.1 by $\exp(x)$ gives the reciprocal formula.  [step 1.1, algebra] ∎

## Statement

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$ and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be
continuous on $[a,b]$ ([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-interval]]) and
differentiable at every point of $(a,b)$ as a function on $[a,b]$
([[def-derivative]]). Then there is $c \in (a,b)$ with

$$f(b) - f(a) \;=\; f'(c)\,(b - a) .$$

Equivalently, since $b - a \ne 0$, there is $c \in (a,b)$ at which
$f'(c) = \bigl(f(b)-f(a)\bigr)/(b-a)$: the derivative somewhere inside equals
the average rate of change across the whole interval.

**Continuity on the closed interval cannot be dropped.** Differentiability at
every point of $(a,b)$ alone does not suffice: a function on $[0,1]$,
differentiable at every point of $(0,1)$ with derivative constantly $1$, for
which no $c$ works, is exhibited later on this page as a false statement, and
the companion page works the same witness out in full.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and a function $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable at every point of $(a,b)$.

[L1] Cauchy's mean value theorem ([[thm-cauchy-mean-value]]): for $f, g$ continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable at every point of $(a,b)$ there is $c \in (a,b)$ with $\bigl(f(b)-f(a)\bigr)g'(c) = \bigl(g(b)-g(a)\bigr)f'(c)$.

[L2] The identity $x \mapsto x$ is continuous at every point of any $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], claim 5).

[L3] The identity $g$ on $[a,b]$ is differentiable at every $c \in [a,b]$ with $g'(c) = 1$: with $a < b$ the set $[a,b]$ is order-convex with at least two elements, so every one of its points is a limit point of it ([[def-derivative]], [[def-interval]]); and the difference quotient of $g$ at $c$ is $(x - c)/(x - c) = 1$ for every $x \in [a,b]$ with $x \ne c$, a constant function, whose limit at $c$ is $1$ ([[def-function-limit]], [[def-derivative]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Define $g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ by $g(x) := x$. [construct]

2.1 $g$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ by [L2]; it is differentiable at every $c \in (a,b)$ with $g'(c) = 1$ by [L3]; and $g(b) - g(a) = b - a$. [step 1.1, L2, L3]

3.1 By step 2.1 the pair $f, g$ satisfies every hypothesis of [L1], so there is $c \in (a,b)$ with $\bigl(f(b)-f(a)\bigr)g'(c) = \bigl(g(b)-g(a)\bigr)f'(c)$. Substituting $g'(c) = 1$ and $g(b)-g(a) = b-a$ gives $f(b) - f(a) = f'(c)(b-a)$. [step 2.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The geometric reading, and what it is not.** The conclusion says that some tangent line is parallel to the chord from $(a, f(a))$ to $(b, f(b))$. It does not say which one, it does not say there is only one, and it says nothing at all about $f$ between the endpoints beyond the hypotheses. Every use of the theorem on this page is a use of the equation, never of the picture.

- **Why this is a corollary and not the primitive statement.** [[thm-cauchy-mean-value]] is proved from [[thm-rolle]] with one auxiliary function, and this statement is that theorem at $g(x) = x$; deriving it the other way round, from this statement to Cauchy's, is also possible but needs an auxiliary function of its own, so nothing is saved. What matters is that both rest on Rolle, and Rolle on the extreme value theorem.

- **The two hypotheses are on different sets on purpose.** Continuity is asked for on the closed interval and differentiability only on the open one, so nothing at all is required of the difference quotients at $a$ and at $b$. Weakening the continuity in step with the differentiability, so that both are asked for on $(a,b)$ only, destroys the theorem, which is exactly what [[cex-mean-value-theorem-fails-without-continuity-at-the-endpoints]] shows on the companion page.

## Statement

If $f(x)=\sum_{n\ge0}a_n(x-c)^n$ for $|x-c|<R$, then $f$ is continuous at every $x_0$ satisfying $|x_0-c|<R$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A power-series sum $f$ and a point $x_0$ strictly inside its radius.

[L1] The series converges uniformly on each closed interval strictly inside its radius ([[thm-power-series-uniform-on-compact-subintervals]]).

[L2] Every polynomial partial sum is continuous, since constants, the identity, powers, scalar multiples and finite sums are continuous ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]]).

[L3] A uniform limit of continuous real-valued functions is continuous ([[thm-uniform-limit-continuous-real-functions]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Choose $\delta>0$ so small that $[x_0-\delta,x_0+\delta]$ lies strictly inside $|x-c|<R$. [given, choose]

1.2 The polynomial partial sums are continuous on this interval by [L2] and converge uniformly there to $f$ by [L1]. [L1, L2]

2.1 By [L3], $f$ is continuous on that interval, and in particular at $x_0$. [step 1.2, L3] ∎

## Statement

For every real $x$, the series $\sum_{n\ge0}x^n/\iota(n!)$ converges absolutely. Its power-series radius is therefore $+\infty$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real $x$.

[L1] Archimedes supplies a natural larger than any prescribed real ([[thm-of-archimedean]]).

[L2] A tail bounded termwise by a convergent geometric series converges ([[thm-direct-comparison-test]], [[thm-geometric-series]]), and absolute convergence implies convergence ([[lem-absolute-convergence-implies-convergence]]).

[L3] Factorials satisfy $(n+1)!=n!(n+1)$ and are nonzero naturals; every positive natural has a positive, hence nonzero, canonical real image ([[def-factorial-and-falling-factorial]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 If $x=0$, the series is $1+0+0+\cdots$ and converges absolutely. Hence assume $x\ne0$. Choose $N\ge1$ with $\iota(N)>2|x|$. For $n\ge N$, the absolute terms $a_n=|x|^n/\iota(n!)$ are positive and satisfy $a_{n+1}/a_n=|x|/\iota(n+1)<1/2$.  [L1, L3, choose]

2.1 Thus $a_{N+j}\le a_N2^{-j}$ by induction, and the tail is dominated by a convergent geometric series.  [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 The zero case from step 1.1 and, when $x\ne0$, adding the finite initial segment to the convergent tail prove absolute convergence for arbitrary $x$. Hence every nonnegative radius works and the radius is $+\infty$.  [step 1.1, step 2.1, L2] ∎

## Statement

The real exponential function is $C^\infty$, and for every $m\in\mathbb N$,
$$\exp^{(m)}=\exp.$$
In particular $(\exp)'=\exp$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The exponential power series.

[L1] A real power series may be differentiated termwise inside its radius ([[thm-termwise-differentiation-of-a-real-power-series]]), and its sum is smooth there ([[cor-power-series-sums-are-smooth-with-coefficient-formula]]).

[L2] The radius is infinite, $(n+1)!=(n+1)n!$, and the canonical embedding preserves products and sends positive naturals to nonzero reals ([[lem-exponential-series-has-infinite-radius]], [[def-factorial-and-falling-factorial]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Termwise differentiation gives $(\exp)'(x)=\sum_{n\ge1}\iota(n)x^{n-1}/\iota(n!)$.  [L1, L2]

2.1 Reindex $n=j+1$ and cancel $\iota(j+1)$ using the factorial recurrence. The series becomes $\sum_{j\ge0}x^j/\iota(j!)=\exp(x)$.  [step 1.1, L2, algebra]

3.1 Smoothness follows from [L1] and the infinite radius; iterating step 2.1 gives every higher derivative.  [step 2.1, L1, L2] ∎
