You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as a
read-only adversarial proof-refuter for the published-page audit. You are
tool-less: you cannot open a file, run a command, browse, edit, or delegate.
Everything you may rely on is reproduced in the `This dispatch` section. Return
evidence only; Audit-Alpha alone adjudicates and edits.

## Triage — the standing rule (verbatim, binding on you)

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct
  citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

## Adversarial standard

Read the target's title, Statement/Definition/Example/Statement refuted, Facts &
Assumptions, every numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks.
Try to falsify the public claim and every load-bearing inference.

1. Compare every cited fact with the supplied source text before alleging that
   it is weak. Check domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, direction, conclusion,
   and whether the source licenses the exact use.
2. Check that the title and public statement assert no more than the proof
   establishes, and that every proof step uses only available premises.
3. Check both directions of biconditionals, uniqueness/existence claims,
   induction and limiting arguments, empty/zero/endpoint/degenerate cases,
   extended-real conventions, index shifts, and hidden division or choice.
4. Re-read Remarks as skeptically as a numbered step. A false mathematical
   remark is a defect even when the proof is sound.
5. When the target is marked `ai-generated`, actively search for a
   counterexample to its claim, witness, or refutation rather than merely
   checking prose consistency.
6. Treat a false public claim, logically invalid proof, missing necessary
   hypothesis, circularity, or materially inaccurate load-bearing citation as
   fatal. Do not inflate an expository omission or a gap closable within thirty
   seconds into a defect.

## Output format

Reply with exactly this structure and no preamble:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

If `DEFECTS`, give one block per finding:

```text
FINDING 1
  location: [exact title, section, fact label, or numbered step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [the exact mathematical assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, missing hypothesis, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]
```

Then always end with:

```text
BOUNDARY: [specific boundary/counterexample checks and their disposition]
SOURCES:  [confirm every supplied cited item used by the target was inspected]
CHECKED:  [confirm the title, public claim, every numbered step, and Remarks were read]

## Statement

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space and give $X \times X$ the product
topology ([[def-product-topology]]). Then $X$ is Hausdorff
([[def-hausdorff-space]]) if and only if the diagonal $\Delta_X$
([[def-the-diagonal-of-a-space]]) is closed in $X \times X$:

$$X \text{ Hausdorff} \iff \Delta_X = \overline{\Delta_X} \text{ in } X \times X .$$

The condition on the right is a single closedness statement about one subset of
one space, with no quantifier over pairs of points visible in it; that is what
makes the criterion useful, and every consequence on this page is obtained by
pulling $\Delta_X$ back along a continuous map.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A topological space $(X,\mathcal{T})$, the product $X \times X$ with the product topology, and the diagonal $\Delta_X = \{\, z \in X \times X : z_0 = z_1 \,\}$.

[A1] $X$ is Hausdorff when for all $x \ne y$ in $X$ there are open $U \ni x$ and $V \ni y$ with $U \cap V = \varnothing$ ([[def-hausdorff-space]]).

[A2] The boxes $U \times V$ with $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$ form a basis for the product topology on $X \times X$, the index set being $2$ ([[def-product-topology]], [[def-topology-basis-subbasis]], [[def-the-diagonal-of-a-space]]).

[L1] For a basis $\mathcal{B}$ of a space, a point lies in $\overline{A}$ if and only if every $B \in \mathcal{B}$ containing it meets $A$; and $A$ is closed if and only if $A = \overline{A}$ ([[thm-closure-characterisation-top]], claims 1(d) and 2, [[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

[L2] $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ for every subset $A$ of a space ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]], [[def-topological-space]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $X$ is Hausdorff and let $z \in X \times X$ with $z \notin \Delta_X$, so that $z_0 \ne z_1$; by [A1] there are open $U \ni z_0$ and $V \ni z_1$ with $U \cap V = \varnothing$. [A1]

1.2 Assume $\Delta_X$ is closed and let $x, y \in X$ with $x \ne y$; then $z := (x,y)$ satisfies $z \notin \Delta_X = \overline{\Delta_X}$, the equality holding by [L1] since $\Delta_X$ is closed. [L1]

2.1 The box $U \times V$ of step 1.1 is a basic open set containing $z$, and $(U \times V) \cap \Delta_X = \varnothing$: a point $w$ of the intersection would satisfy $w_0 = w_1$ with $w_0 \in U$ and $w_1 \in V$, putting $w_0$ in $U \cap V = \varnothing$. [step 1.1, A2]

2.2 By [L1] applied to the basis of [A2], step 1.2 supplies a basic open box $U \times V$ with $z \in U \times V$ and $(U \times V) \cap \Delta_X = \varnothing$; so $x \in U$ and $y \in V$. [step 1.2, A2, L1]

3.1 From step 2.1 and [L1], $z \notin \overline{\Delta_X}$ for every $z \notin \Delta_X$; hence $\overline{\Delta_X} \subseteq \Delta_X$, and with [L2] this gives $\overline{\Delta_X} = \Delta_X$, so $\Delta_X$ is closed. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L1, L2]

3.2 The sets $U$ and $V$ of step 2.2 are disjoint: if $t \in U \cap V$ then $(t,t)$ lies in $U \times V$ and in $\Delta_X$, contradicting $(U \times V) \cap \Delta_X = \varnothing$. [step 2.2]

4.1 Step 3.1 shows that $X$ Hausdorff implies $\Delta_X$ closed, and steps 2.2 and 3.2 show that $\Delta_X$ closed implies that any two distinct points of $X$ have disjoint open neighbourhoods, which by [A1] is the Hausdorff condition; the two implications are the theorem. [step 2.2, step 3.1, step 3.2, A1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The criterion is about the product topology on a binary product**, and there the box basis and the product basis are the same family ([[def-product-topology]]), so the boxes tested in steps 2.1 and 2.2 are legitimately basic. No infinite product is formed anywhere in the argument, and the criterion says nothing about one.

- **Neither direction spends a choice principle.** The forward direction produces one box from one Hausdorff separation of one named pair, and the backward direction reads one box out of the closure characterisation; there is no family to select from in either.

- **What the criterion does not say.** It does not say that $\Delta_X$ is closed in $X \times X$ carrying some other topology, and it does not say that $\Delta_X$ is closed in $X$ — the latter is not even a statement, $\Delta_X$ being a subset of the square. The hypothesis that $X \times X$ carries the product topology is used at [A2] and cannot be dropped.

## Definition

A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ ([[def-topological-space]]) is
**Hausdorff** when any two distinct points are separated by disjoint open sets:
for all $x, y \in X$ with $x \ne y$ there are $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$ with

$$x \in U, \qquad y \in V, \qquad U \cap V = \varnothing .$$

Since an open set containing a point is an open neighbourhood of it
([[def-neighbourhood-top]]), the condition reads: distinct points have disjoint
open neighbourhoods. Nothing is asserted about points that are equal, and the
condition is vacuous for a space with at most one point, so every such space is
Hausdorff.

**Every metrizable space is Hausdorff.** This is not proved here, because it is
already discharged: [[def-metrizable-space]] records it among the two things
every metrizable space has, deriving it from
[[thm-metric-hausdorff-separation]], which separates $p \ne q$ in a metric space
by the disjoint open balls $B(p,r)$ and $B(q,r)$ with $r = d(p,q)/2 > 0$. In
particular $\mathbb{R}$ with its usual topology, every $\mathbb{R}^n$, and every
subspace of a metrizable space are Hausdorff.

**Not every space is Hausdorff.** The indiscrete topology
$\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{ind}} = \{\varnothing, X\}$ on a set $X = \{a,b\}$ with
$a \ne b$ ([[def-standard-topologies]]) is not: the only open set containing $a$
is $X$, the only one containing $b$ is $X$, and $X \cap X = X \ne \varnothing$.
This is the same two-point space that [[def-metrizable-space]] uses to exhibit a
topology induced by no metric, and the reason is the same one: failure of the
Hausdorff condition is an obstruction to metrizability.

**Being Hausdorff is a topological property** ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]).
If $h : X \to Z$ is a homeomorphism and $X$ is Hausdorff, then for $z \ne z'$ in
$Z$ the points $h^{-1}(z)$ and $h^{-1}(z')$ are distinct, so they have disjoint
open $U, V$; the images $h[U]$ and $h[V]$ are open, disjoint, and contain $z$ and
$z'$ respectively, a homeomorphism carrying the open sets of one space
bijectively onto those of the other. So no space homeomorphic to a Hausdorff
space fails the condition.

**Scope of this item.** Only the definition, the metrizable case and the
two-point failure are recorded here, because that is all this page uses. The
Hausdorff condition is one of a graded family of separation axioms; that family,
its ordering, and the questions of which of its members are hereditary or
preserved by products, are not available at this point in the reading order and
nothing here anticipates them. What this page does use is a single negative
result: a quotient of a Hausdorff space need not be Hausdorff, which is recorded
below as a false statement and witnessed on the companion page.

## Remarks

- **Hausdorff spaces have closed singletons.** Fix $x \in X$ and take the union
  of all open subsets of $X$ that avoid $x$. Every $y \ne x$ belongs to one of
  them, by Hausdorff separation of $x$ and $y$, while $x$ belongs to none. The
  union is therefore exactly $X \setminus \{x\}$, so $\{x\}$ is closed.
  Thus the Hausdorff property implies the singleton-closed ($T_1$) property.
  The converse fails: closed singletons need not give disjoint neighbourhoods
  of distinct points.

- **What the Hausdorff condition buys, in the one place this page needs it.**
  Separation of distinct points by disjoint open sets is exactly what a quotient
  map can destroy: identifying points of a Hausdorff space can leave two classes
  every pair of whose open neighbourhoods meet, and the companion page exhibits
  such a quotient of a metrizable space. Nothing weaker than an explicit witness
  settles that, since the condition is a statement about all pairs of open sets.

- **The name.** Hausdorff's own 1914 axiom system for a topological space
  included this condition, so "topological space" once meant what is now called a
  Hausdorff space; this library follows the modern convention in which
  [[def-topological-space]] assumes no separation at all and every separation
  hypothesis is stated where it is used.

## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]), let
$A \subseteq X$ and let $x \in X$. Neighbourhoods are as in
[[def-neighbourhood-top]], so a neighbourhood need not be open.

- The **interior** of $A$ is
  $\operatorname{int}(A) := \bigcup \{\, U \in \mathcal{T} : U \subseteq A \,\}$.
- The **closure** of $A$ is
  $\overline{A} := \bigcap \{\, F \subseteq X : F \text{ closed and } A \subseteq F \,\}$.
- The **exterior** of $A$ is $\operatorname{ext}(A) := \operatorname{int}(X \setminus A)$.
- The **boundary** of $A$ is $\partial A := \overline{A} \setminus \operatorname{int}(A)$.
- $x$ is a **limit point** (accumulation point) of $A$ if every neighbourhood $N$
  of $x$ satisfies $N \cap (A \setminus \{x\}) \ne \varnothing$. The set of limit
  points of $A$ is the **derived set** $A'$.
- $x$ is an **isolated point of $A$** if $x \in A$ and some neighbourhood $N$ of
  $x$ satisfies $N \cap A = \{x\}$.

**Both operators are well posed, and the two names are justified rather than
asserted.** The interior is a union of open sets, hence open by (T2), it is
contained in $A$, and it contains every open $U \subseteq A$: so
$\operatorname{int}(A)$ is *the largest open subset of $A$*. The family being
intersected in the definition of $\overline{A}$ is nonempty, since $X$ is closed
and contains $A$, so the intersection is a set; it is closed by (C2) of
[[def-topological-space]], it contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed
$F \supseteq A$: so $\overline{A}$ is *the smallest closed superset of $A$*. In
particular

$$\operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq A \subseteq \overline{A},$$

and $A$ is open if and only if $A = \operatorname{int}(A)$, and closed if and
only if $A = \overline{A}$, in each case because one inclusion is automatic and
the other says exactly that $A$ belongs to the family in question.

**Interior and closure are exchanged by complementation.** For every
$A \subseteq X$,

$$X \setminus \operatorname{int}(A) = \overline{X \setminus A}, \qquad X \setminus \overline{A} = \operatorname{int}(X \setminus A) = \operatorname{ext}(A).$$

Indeed $U \mapsto X \setminus U$ is a bijection between the open subsets of $A$
and the closed supersets of $X \setminus A$, and it turns unions into
intersections ([[def-topological-space]]); applying complementation to the first
identity gives the second. So $\operatorname{ext}(A) = X \setminus \overline{A}$,
and every statement about interiors has a mirror statement about closures.

**The pointwise description of the interior.** $x \in \operatorname{int}(A)$ if
and only if $A$ is a neighbourhood of $x$. If $x \in \operatorname{int}(A)$ then
$\operatorname{int}(A)$ is an open set with $x \in \operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq A$;
conversely a neighbourhood relation $x \in U \subseteq A$ with $U$ open puts $x$
in the union defining $\operatorname{int}(A)$. The corresponding description of
the closure is proved as the next item, because it is the statement that does the
work in every later proof.

**$X$ is the disjoint union of the three regions.** Since
$\operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq \overline{A}$, the three sets
$\operatorname{int}(A)$, $\partial A = \overline{A} \setminus \operatorname{int}(A)$
and $\operatorname{ext}(A) = X \setminus \overline{A}$ are pairwise disjoint and
their union is $X$. This is recorded again, with the identities for interior and
closure of unions and intersections, in the lemma two items below.

## Remarks

- **The boundary is symmetric in $A$ and its complement**:
  $\partial A = \overline{A} \cap \overline{X \setminus A}$, because
  $\overline{A} \setminus \operatorname{int}(A) = \overline{A} \cap (X \setminus \operatorname{int}(A)) = \overline{A} \cap \overline{X \setminus A}$
  by the complementation identity above. Hence $\partial A = \partial(X \setminus A)$,
  and $\partial A$ is closed, being an intersection of two closed sets.

- **A limit point of $A$ need not lie in $A$, and a point of $A$ need not be a
  limit point of $A$.** The points of $A$ that are not limit points of $A$ are
  exactly its isolated points, directly from the two definitions. The relation
  $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$ is a theorem, proved next, not a restatement.

- **These are the metric notions when the topology is a metric topology.** For a
  metric space the definitions of [[def-metric-interior-closure-boundary]] are
  stated with balls in place of neighbourhoods, and the balls around $x$ are a
  neighbourhood base at $x$; the identification is carried out where metrizable
  spaces are defined, later on this page, and it is what allows metric examples
  to be quoted here without reproof.

## Definition

**The product set.** Let $I$ be a set and let $X_i$ be a set for each $i \in I$.
The **product** is

$$\prod_{i \in I} X_i \;:=\; \Big\{\, x : x \text{ is a function with domain } I \text{ and } x(i) \in X_i \text{ for every } i \in I \,\Big\},$$

and we write $x_i := x(i)$, the $i$-th **coordinate** of $x$. Two elements of the
product are equal exactly when they agree at every index, functions being equal
when they have the same domain and the same values. For $j \in I$ the $j$-th
**projection** is

$$\pi_j : \prod_{i \in I} X_i \to X_j, \qquad \pi_j(x) := x_j .$$

**Notation for a finite product.** For $I = n$ a natural number, which is the set
$\{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ of its predecessors, an element of $\prod_{k<n} X_k$ is a
function on $n$ and we write it $(x_0, \dots, x_{n-1})$. In particular $I = 2$
gives the **binary product**, written $X \times Y$ for $\prod_{i<2} X_i$ with
$X_0 = X$ and $X_1 = Y$, whose elements are written $(u,v)$ for the function
$0 \mapsto u$, $1 \mapsto v$. This is the only meaning the symbol $X \times Y$
carries on this page.

**Two facts about when the product is nonempty, stated because they are used and
because they cost something.** If some $X_{i_0}$ is empty then the product is
empty, since no function can take a value in $X_{i_0}$. Conversely, suppose every
$X_i$ is nonempty.

- For $I = n$ a natural number, the product is nonempty, and this is a theorem of
  ZF: [[lem-finite-choice]] applied to the function $i \mapsto X_i$ on $n$
  supplies a choice function $g$ for the family of values, and
  $x(i) := g(X_i)$ defines a member of $\prod_{k<n} X_k$.
- For an arbitrary $I$ the assertion "$\prod_{i \in I} X_i \ne \varnothing$
  whenever every $X_i$ is nonempty" **is** the Axiom of Choice: it is the
  formulation recorded in [[def-axiom-of-choice]], and the choice function of
  [[def-choice-function]] is exactly a point of the product of a family by
  itself. Every use of it below is flagged at the step that spends it.

**The box topology.** Now let each $X_i$ carry a topology $\mathcal{T}_i$
([[def-topological-space]]). Put

$$\mathcal{R} \;:=\; \Big\{\, \prod_{i \in I} U_i \;:\; U_i \in \mathcal{T}_i \text{ for every } i \in I \,\Big\},$$

the family of **boxes**. $\mathcal{R}$ is a basis for a topology
([[thm-basis-criterion]]): it contains $\prod_i X_i$, so it covers the product,
and it is closed under binary intersections, since

$$\Big(\prod_i U_i\Big) \cap \Big(\prod_i V_i\Big) = \prod_i (U_i \cap V_i)$$

and each $U_i \cap V_i$ is open by (T3). The topology it generates is the **box
topology** $\mathcal{T}^{\square}$, and $\mathcal{R}$ is a basis for it
([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]).

**The product topology.** The **product topology** $\mathcal{T}^{\Pi}$ on
$\prod_i X_i$ is the initial topology of the family of projections
$(\pi_i)_{i \in I}$ ([[def-initial-and-final-topology]]): the topology generated
by the subbasis

$$\mathcal{G} \;:=\; \{\, \pi_i^{-1}[U] : i \in I,\ U \in \mathcal{T}_i \,\}, \qquad \pi_i^{-1}[U] = \prod_{j \in I} W_j \ \text{ with } W_i = U \text{ and } W_j = X_j \text{ for } j \ne i .$$

By [[thm-basis-criterion]] the finite intersections of members of $\mathcal{G}$
form a basis for $\mathcal{T}^{\Pi}$, and those finite intersections are exactly
the boxes with all but finitely many factors unrestricted:

$$\mathcal{R}^{\Pi} \;=\; \Big\{\, \prod_{i \in I} U_i \;:\; U_i \in \mathcal{T}_i \text{ for every } i, \text{ and } U_i = X_i \text{ for all but finitely many } i \,\Big\}.$$

Indeed the intersection of $\pi_{i_1}^{-1}[U_1], \dots, \pi_{i_n}^{-1}[U_n]$ is
the box whose factor at $i$ is the intersection of those $U_m$ with $i_m = i$ and
is $X_i$ when no $i_m$ equals $i$; and the intersection of no members is the
whole product, the box with every factor $X_i$. Conversely a box with
$U_i = X_i$ off a finite set is such an intersection. Members of
$\mathcal{R}^{\Pi}$ are called **basic product-open** sets, and members of
$\mathcal{R}$ **boxes**. So $\mathcal{R}^{\Pi} \subseteq \mathcal{R}$, with
equality when $I$ is a natural number.

**The empty product.** For $I = \varnothing$ there is exactly one function with
domain $\varnothing$, the empty function, so $\prod_{i \in \varnothing} X_i$ is a
one-point set. A one-point set carries exactly one topology, namely
$\{\varnothing, \{\varnothing\}\}$, since a topology must contain the empty set
and the whole set and there is nothing else to contain
([[def-topological-space]]); so the box topology and the product topology agree
there, and both equal the discrete topology and the indiscrete topology
([[def-standard-topologies]]), which coincide on a one-point set. There are no
projections to speak of, and the initial topology of the empty family is indeed
the indiscrete one ([[def-initial-and-final-topology]]).

**Convention.** Unless the box topology is named explicitly, $\prod_i X_i$ always
carries the product topology in this library. That is not a matter of taste: the
product topology is the one with the characteristic property of the next item,
and the box topology has no such property.

## Remarks

- **Where the two topologies actually differ.** The box topology is finer than
  the product topology by construction, since $\mathcal{R}^{\Pi} \subseteq
  \mathcal{R}$. They agree whenever $I$ is finite; and, assuming the Axiom of Choice, for a
  family of **nonempty** spaces they differ for infinite $I$ as soon as infinitely
  many factors have a nonempty proper open subset. Nonemptiness is not decoration: if one factor is
  empty then the product is empty and carries exactly one topology, so the two
  agree however the other factors are chosen. Both statements are proved two items
  below, with that hypothesis, and the failure is recorded on this page as a false
  statement.

- **The product set is a set of functions, and that is not a technicality.** The
  factors are indexed by an arbitrary set, so there is no "list" to write down;
  writing $x = (x_i)_{i \in I}$ is notation for the function $x$. The finite case
  recovers the familiar tuple, and the identification of $\prod_{k<n}\mathbb{R}$
  with the $\mathbb{R}^n$ of [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] is literal, that item defining
  $\mathbb{R}^n$ as the set of functions $n \to \mathbb{R}$.

- **The projections carry no hypothesis.** They are defined for every product,
  including the empty one and products with an empty factor; what does need a
  hypothesis is their *surjectivity*, which is the point at which choice enters
  and which is stated separately in the next item.

## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be topological spaces
([[def-topological-space]]). Throughout, $X \times Y$ is the binary product
$\prod_{i<2} X_i$ with $X_0 = X$ and $X_1 = Y$ ([[def-product-topology]]),
carrying the product topology; a point of it is a **function** $z$ on the von
Neumann natural $2 = \{0,1\}$, written $(z_0, z_1)$, and $\pi_0, \pi_1$ are the
two projections.

**The basis used throughout.** For the index set $2$ the product basis and the
box basis coincide, since a box $\prod_{i<2} U_i$ has all but finitely many
factors unrestricted for the trivial reason that it has only two
([[def-product-topology]]). So

$$\{\, U \times V : U \in \mathcal{T},\ V \in \mathcal{T}_Y \,\}$$

is a basis for the product topology on $X \times Y$, and every statement below
that tests a basic open set tests a box of two open sets.

**The diagonal.** The **diagonal** of $X$ is

$$\Delta_X \;:=\; \{\, z \in X \times X : z_0 = z_1 \,\} \;=\; \{\, (x,x) : x \in X \,\} ,$$

the second description being the first read through the definition of a point of
the product as a function on $2$. It is a subset of $X \times X$ and is given the
subspace topology ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]) whenever it is regarded as a
space.

**The diagonal map.** The **diagonal map** of $X$ is

$$\delta_X : X \to X \times X, \qquad \delta_X(x) := (x,x) ,$$

that is, the function sending $x$ to the constant function $2 \to X$ with value
$x$. Its two components are $\pi_0 \circ \delta_X = \mathrm{id}_X$ and
$\pi_1 \circ \delta_X = \mathrm{id}_X$, and by claim 2 of
[[thm-product-universal-property]] it is the *unique* function $X \to X \times X$
with those two components. The same claim makes it **continuous**
([[def-continuous-map-top]]), the identity being continuous. Its image is
$\Delta_X$, and it is injective, since $\delta_X(x) = \delta_X(x')$ forces
$x = x'$ by reading the coordinate at $0$. Whether $\delta_X$ is an **embedding**
onto $\Delta_X$ ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]) is not asserted here; it is
the content of the next item.

**The pairing of two maps.** For functions $f : Z \to X$ and $g : Z \to Y$ on a
common domain, the **pairing** is

$$\langle f, g \rangle : Z \to X \times Y, \qquad \langle f, g \rangle(z) := (f(z), g(z)) .$$

By claim 2 of [[thm-product-universal-property]] it is the unique function
$Z \to X \times Y$ with $\pi_0 \circ \langle f, g \rangle = f$ and
$\pi_1 \circ \langle f, g \rangle = g$; no hypothesis on $f$ and $g$ is needed
for the pairing to be defined, and continuity of the pairing is exactly
continuity of both components, which is again that claim. In this notation

$$\delta_X = \langle \mathrm{id}_X, \mathrm{id}_X \rangle ,$$

so the diagonal map is a special case of the pairing and needs no separate
treatment.

**The preimage identity that every later proof uses.** For $f, g : Z \to Y$,

$$\langle f, g \rangle^{-1}[\Delta_Y] \;=\; \{\, z \in Z : f(z) = g(z) \,\} ,$$

directly from the definitions above: $\langle f, g \rangle(z) \in \Delta_Y$ says
that the function $(f(z), g(z))$ on $2$ takes the same value at $0$ and at $1$.

## Remarks

- **The diagonal is a subset of a product, and the diagonal map is a function
  into it; they are different objects with the same name.** The set $\Delta_X$
  records which pairs are repetitions, and the map $\delta_X$ produces the
  repetitions. Both are needed: the closedness criterion of this page is about the
  set, and the transport of properties from $X$ to its copy inside the square is
  about the map.

- **Nothing here depends on a choice principle.** The product $X \times X$ is a
  binary product, and a point of it is exhibited by naming its two coordinates;
  the nonemptiness of an arbitrary product, which is where choice enters
  ([[thm-product-universal-property]], claim 4), is never invoked for a binary
  product with a named point.

- **Why the box description is recorded at the top.** The criterion proved on
  this page tests basic open sets of $X \times X$, and for the binary product
  there is no gap between the box topology and the product topology to worry
  about ([[def-product-topology]]). No infinite product is formed anywhere on
  this page, so the distinction never becomes live here.

- **(T1)** $\varnothing \in \mathcal{T}$ and $X \in \mathcal{T}$;
- **(T2)** $\bigcup \mathcal{S} \in \mathcal{T}$ for every $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$;
- **(T3)** $U \cap V \in \mathcal{T}$ for all $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$.

A **topological space** is a pair $(X, \mathcal{T})$ consisting of a set $X$ and
a topology $\mathcal{T}$ on it; the elements of $X$ are its **points**. When only
one topology is in play we write $X$ for the pair; when several are, the topology
is always named.

The members of $\mathcal{T}$ are the **open** sets of $(X,\mathcal{T})$. A subset
$F \subseteq X$ is **closed** when its complement $X \setminus F$ is open, and
**clopen** when it is both open and closed. By (T1) both $\varnothing$ and $X$
are clopen. *Open and closed are not opposites*: a set may be neither, and it may
be both, so "not open" is never a synonym for "closed".

**Finite intersections, and the empty one.** Axiom (T3) is stated for two sets
because that is all that is ever needed: if $n \ge 1$ and
$U_1, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{T}$, then $U_1 \cap \dots \cap U_n \in \mathcal{T}$
follows by iterating (T3) $n-1$ times. The intersection of the **empty** family
of subsets of $X$ is $X$, since the condition "lies in every member of the empty
family" is vacuous; that case is covered by (T1) rather than by (T3), which is
one of the two reasons $X \in \mathcal{T}$ is demanded outright. The other is
that (T2) alone gives only $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$.

**The closed sets, and the dual axiomatisation.** Put
$\mathcal{C} := \{\, X \setminus U : U \in \mathcal{T} \,\}$, the family of closed
sets. Then

- **(C1)** $\varnothing \in \mathcal{C}$ and $X \in \mathcal{C}$;
- **(C2)** $\bigcap \mathcal{D} \in \mathcal{C}$ for every **nonempty**
  $\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$;
- **(C3)** $C \cup D \in \mathcal{C}$ for all $C, D \in \mathcal{C}$.

Conversely, if a family $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ satisfies (C1),
(C2) and (C3), then $\mathcal{T} := \{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{C} \,\}$
is a topology on $X$ whose closed sets are exactly the members of $\mathcal{C}$.
So a topology may be presented equally well by its open sets or by its closed
sets, and this library uses whichever is shorter.

*Both directions are one computation, and it is carried out here rather than
assumed.* The map $U \mapsto X \setminus U$ is an involution of
$\mathcal{P}(X)$, hence a bijection, and it carries the two De Morgan identities

$$X \setminus \bigcup_{i \in I} A_i = \bigcap_{i \in I} (X \setminus A_i) \quad (I \ne \varnothing), \qquad X \setminus \bigcap_{i \in I} A_i = \bigcup_{i \in I} (X \setminus A_i) \quad (I \ne \varnothing)$$

term by term into each other. Given (T1)–(T3): $\varnothing = X \setminus X$ and
$X = X \setminus \varnothing$ lie in $\mathcal{C}$, which is (C1); for nonempty
$\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$ the family
$\mathcal{S} = \{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{D} \,\}$ lies in $\mathcal{T}$
and $\bigcap \mathcal{D} = X \setminus \bigcup \mathcal{S}$ is closed by (T2),
which is (C2); and $C \cup D = X \setminus ((X \setminus C) \cap (X \setminus D))$
is closed by (T3), which is (C3). Given (C1)–(C3) the same three lines run
backwards, the empty-union case $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$ being supplied
by (C1) rather than by (C2); and $\{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{C} \,\}$ has
$\mathcal{C}$ as its family of complements because complementation is an
involution.

**Comparison of topologies.** If $\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ are
topologies on the same set $X$ and $\mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2$, then
$\mathcal{T}_1$ is **coarser** than $\mathcal{T}_2$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ is
**finer** than $\mathcal{T}_1$; the comparison is **strict** when the inclusion
is. Inclusion is a partial order on the set of topologies on $X$
([[def-partial-order]]), and it is not a total one: two topologies on the same
set may be incomparable.

## Remarks

- **The topology is part of the data.** Two different topologies on one set are
  two different topological spaces, exactly as two different metrics on one set
  are two different metric spaces. Every statement below that says "the space
  $X$" has a topology fixed in advance.

- **Nothing is assumed beyond (T1)–(T3).** In particular no separation property
  is built into the word *space* here: distinct points need not lie in disjoint
  open sets, singletons need not be closed, and both failures occur in the
  standard topologies defined on the next item. Where a separation property is
  used it is stated as a hypothesis.

- **This library always writes *coarser* and *finer*.** The synonyms
  *smaller/larger* are unambiguous, but *weaker/stronger* is used in both
  directions in the literature and is avoided here entirely.

- **Why "arbitrary unions, finite intersections" and not the reverse.** The
  asymmetry is not a convention: it is what makes the metric notion of open set
  ([[def-metric-topology]]) an instance, and an arbitrary intersection of open
  sets genuinely need not be open. The failure is recorded on this page as a
  false statement, with witnesses in two different spaces.

## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]).

A family $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$ is a **basis for $\mathcal{T}$** if
every open set is a union of members of $\mathcal{B}$: for every
$U \in \mathcal{T}$ there is $\mathcal{B}_U \subseteq \mathcal{B}$ with
$U = \bigcup \mathcal{B}_U$. Equivalently, and this is the form used in proofs,

$$\text{for every } U \in \mathcal{T} \text{ and every } x \in U \text{ there is } B \in \mathcal{B} \text{ with } x \in B \subseteq U .$$

*The two forms say the same thing.* If every open $U$ is such a union and
$x \in U$, then $x$ lies in one of the sets united, which is a member of
$\mathcal{B}$ inside $U$. Conversely, if the displayed condition holds then
$U = \bigcup \{\, B \in \mathcal{B} : B \subseteq U \,\}$, since each such $B$ is
contained in $U$ and each $x \in U$ lies in one of them. Note that
$\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$, so the empty open set is covered by the empty
subfamily and needs no member of $\mathcal{B}$. The members of a basis are called
**basic open sets**.

**The topology generated by a family.** Let $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$
be *any* family of subsets of $X$. Then

$$\langle \mathcal{S} \rangle := \bigcap \{\, \mathcal{T}' : \mathcal{T}' \text{ is a topology on } X \text{ with } \mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{T}' \,\}$$

is a topology on $X$, it contains $\mathcal{S}$, and it is contained in every
topology on $X$ that contains $\mathcal{S}$. It is called the **topology
generated by $\mathcal{S}$**, and $\mathcal{S}$ is a **subbasis** for a topology
$\mathcal{T}$ when $\mathcal{T} = \langle \mathcal{S} \rangle$.

*This is well posed, and the obligation is discharged here.* The collection being
intersected is nonempty, because $\mathcal{P}(X)$ is a topology on $X$ containing
$\mathcal{S}$; so the intersection is an intersection of a nonempty family of
subsets of $\mathcal{P}(X)$ and is a set. It is a topology: $\varnothing$ and $X$
lie in every topology on $X$, hence in the intersection, which is (T1); if
$\mathcal{S}' \subseteq \langle \mathcal{S} \rangle$ then $\mathcal{S}'$ is a
subfamily of each $\mathcal{T}'$ in the collection, so $\bigcup \mathcal{S}'$ lies
in each $\mathcal{T}'$ and hence in the intersection, which is (T2); and the same
argument with $U \cap V$ gives (T3). It contains $\mathcal{S}$ because every
$\mathcal{T}'$ in the collection does, and it is contained in each such
$\mathcal{T}'$ because an intersection is contained in each of its members. So
$\langle \mathcal{S} \rangle$ is the coarsest topology on $X$ containing
$\mathcal{S}$ ([[def-topological-space]]), and in particular it is uniquely
determined by $\mathcal{S}$.

**Neither notion is intrinsic to the family alone.** "$\mathcal{B}$ is a basis
for $\mathcal{T}$" and "$\mathcal{S}$ is a subbasis for $\mathcal{T}$" are
relations between a family and a topology, not properties of the family. The
question of which families are a basis *for some* topology, and how the topology
generated by a subbasis is computed from it, is settled by the next item.

## Remarks

- **Every topology is a basis for itself**, so a basis always exists; the point
  of a basis is to be smaller and more explicit than $\mathcal{T}$, and the point
  of a subbasis is to be smaller still at the cost of one round of finite
  intersections.

- **Two extremes of the generated topology.** $\langle \varnothing \rangle$ is
  the indiscrete topology, since $\{\varnothing, X\}$ is a topology containing the
  empty family and is contained in every topology. At the other end,
  $\langle \mathcal{P}(X) \rangle = \mathcal{P}(X)$ is the discrete topology.

- **Generation is monotone and idempotent.** If
  $\mathcal{S}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{S}_2$ then every topology containing
  $\mathcal{S}_2$ contains $\mathcal{S}_1$, so
  $\langle \mathcal{S}_1 \rangle \subseteq \langle \mathcal{S}_2 \rangle$; and
  $\langle \langle \mathcal{S} \rangle \rangle = \langle \mathcal{S} \rangle$
  because $\langle \mathcal{S} \rangle$ is itself a topology containing
  $\mathcal{S}$. Both are used silently below.

## Statement

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, let $\mathcal{B}$ be a basis for
$\mathcal{T}$ ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]), let $A \subseteq X$ and let
$x \in X$. Closure, derived set and limit points are as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]. Then:

1. The following four conditions are equivalent.
   - (a) $x \in \overline{A}$;
   - (b) $N \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every neighbourhood $N$ of $x$
     ([[def-neighbourhood-top]]);
   - (c) $U \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every open $U$ with $x \in U$;
   - (d) $B \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every $B \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B$.
2. $\overline{A}$ is closed, contains $A$, and is contained in every closed
   $F \subseteq X$ with $A \subseteq F$; so it is the smallest closed superset of
   $A$, and $A$ is closed if and only if $A = \overline{A}$.
3. $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$.

Claim 2 is recorded here for reference and is discharged in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]], where it is what makes the definition of
$\overline{A}$ well posed; claims 1 and 3 are proved below. Claim 1 is the form in
which the closure is used everywhere afterwards, and clause (d) is what makes a
closure computable from a basis rather than from all open sets.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A topological space $(X,\mathcal{T})$, a basis $\mathcal{B}$ for $\mathcal{T}$, a subset $A \subseteq X$ and a point $x \in X$.

[A1] $\overline{A}$ is the intersection of all closed supersets of $A$; it is closed, contains $A$, and is contained in every closed superset of $A$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

[A2] $x \in A'$ means that $N \cap (A \setminus \{x\}) \ne \varnothing$ for every neighbourhood $N$ of $x$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

[L1] $N$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ when $x \in U \subseteq N$ for some open $U$; an open set containing $x$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ ([[def-neighbourhood-top]]).

[L2] $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for $\mathcal{T}$: for every open $U$ and every $x \in U$ there is $B \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B \subseteq U$, and every member of $\mathcal{B}$ is open ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]).

[L3] A set is closed exactly when its complement is open ([[def-topological-space]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 (a) implies (c): let $U$ be open with $x \in U$ and suppose $U \cap A = \varnothing$; then $X \setminus U$ is closed and contains $A$, so $\overline{A} \subseteq X \setminus U$ by [A1], whence $x \notin \overline{A}$, contradicting (a); therefore $U \cap A \ne \varnothing$. [A1, L3]

1.2 (c) implies (a): suppose $x \notin \overline{A}$; then $U := X \setminus \overline{A}$ is open by [A1] and [L3], contains $x$, and satisfies $U \cap A = \varnothing$ because $A \subseteq \overline{A}$, so (c) fails. [A1, L3]

1.3 (b) implies (c): an open $U$ containing $x$ is a neighbourhood of $x$, so (b) applies to it. [L1]

1.4 (c) implies (b): let $N$ be a neighbourhood of $x$ and fix open $U$ with $x \in U \subseteq N$; then $\varnothing \ne U \cap A \subseteq N \cap A$. [L1]

1.5 (c) implies (d): every $B \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B$ is an open set containing $x$. [L2]

1.6 (d) implies (c): let $U$ be open with $x \in U$ and fix $B \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B \subseteq U$; then $\varnothing \ne B \cap A \subseteq U \cap A$. [L2]

1.7 $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ and $\overline{A}$ is closed, and $\overline{A}$ is contained in every closed superset of $A$, which is claim 2; in particular $A$ is closed exactly when $A = \overline{A}$, since one inclusion always holds and the other says that $A$ is a closed superset of itself. [A1, L3]

2.1 By steps 1.1 to 1.6 the four conditions (a), (b), (c) and (d) are equivalent, which is claim 1: (a) and (c) are equivalent by steps 1.1 and 1.2, (b) and (c) by steps 1.3 and 1.4, and (c) and (d) by steps 1.5 and 1.6. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6]

3.1 $A \cup A' \subseteq \overline{A}$: points of $A$ lie in $\overline{A}$ by [A1], and if $x \in A'$ then every neighbourhood $N$ of $x$ meets $A \setminus \{x\}$ and hence meets $A$, so $x \in \overline{A}$ by condition (b). [step 2.1, A1, A2]

3.2 $\overline{A} \subseteq A \cup A'$: let $x \in \overline{A}$ and suppose $x \notin A$; then for every neighbourhood $N$ of $x$ condition (b) gives $N \cap A \ne \varnothing$, and $A = A \setminus \{x\}$ because $x \notin A$, so $N \cap (A \setminus \{x\}) \ne \varnothing$ and $x \in A'$. [step 2.1, A2]

4.1 Steps 3.1 and 3.2 give $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$, which is claim 3; with step 2.1 for claim 1 and step 1.7 for claim 2 the theorem is proved. [step 1.7, step 2.1, step 3.1, step 3.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Clause (d) is relative to a basis and clause (c) is not.** Different bases for one topology give different families of test sets in (d), and the theorem says all of them detect the same closure. This is why a closure in a metric space may be computed with balls alone, and a closure in $\mathbb{R}$ with bounded open intervals alone.

- **The empty set and the whole space.** $\overline{\varnothing} = \varnothing$, since $\varnothing$ is closed, and $\overline{X} = X$; claim 1 reads correctly in both cases, no neighbourhood meeting $\varnothing$ and every neighbourhood meeting $X$.

- **Nothing here assumes that singletons are closed.** In the indiscrete topology on a set with at least two points, $\overline{\{x\}} = X$ for every $x$, since the only neighbourhood of any point is $X$; claim 3 then says $A' = X \setminus \{x\}$ is contained in $\overline{\{x\}}$, which it is.
