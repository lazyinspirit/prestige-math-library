You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as a
read-only adversarial proof-refuter for the published-page audit. You are
tool-less: you cannot open a file, run a command, browse, edit, or delegate.
Everything you may rely on is reproduced in the `This dispatch` section. Return
evidence only; Audit-Alpha alone adjudicates and edits.

## Triage — the standing rule (verbatim, binding on you)

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct
  citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

## Adversarial standard

Read the target's title, Statement/Definition/Example/Statement refuted, Facts &
Assumptions, every numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks.
Try to falsify the public claim and every load-bearing inference.

1. Compare every cited fact with the supplied source text before alleging that
   it is weak. Check domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, direction, conclusion,
   and whether the source licenses the exact use.
2. Check that the title and public statement assert no more than the proof
   establishes, and that every proof step uses only available premises.
3. Check both directions of biconditionals, uniqueness/existence claims,
   induction and limiting arguments, empty/zero/endpoint/degenerate cases,
   extended-real conventions, index shifts, and hidden division or choice.
4. Re-read Remarks as skeptically as a numbered step. A false mathematical
   remark is a defect even when the proof is sound.
5. When the target is marked `ai-generated`, actively search for a
   counterexample to its claim, witness, or refutation rather than merely
   checking prose consistency.
6. Treat a false public claim, logically invalid proof, missing necessary
   hypothesis, circularity, or materially inaccurate load-bearing citation as
   fatal. Do not inflate an expository omission or a gap closable within thirty
   seconds into a defect.

## Output format

Reply with exactly this structure and no preamble:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

If `DEFECTS`, give one block per finding:

```text
FINDING 1
  location: [exact title, section, fact label, or numbered step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [the exact mathematical assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, missing hypothesis, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]
```

Then always end with:

```text

SOURCES:  [confirm every supplied cited item used by the target was inspected]
CHECKED:  [confirm the title, public claim, every numbered step, and Remarks were read]

## Definition

Let $A, B, E \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with closure as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]].

- $A$ and $B$ are **separated** when
  $$\overline{A} \cap B = \varnothing \quad \text{and} \quad A \cap \overline{B} = \varnothing .$$
- A **disconnection** of $E$ is a pair $(A,B)$ of nonempty separated sets with
  $E = A \cup B$.
- $E$ is **disconnected** when it admits a disconnection, and **connected** when
  it does not.

**Separated is strictly stronger than disjoint.** Since $A \subseteq
\overline{A}$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]), the first displayed
condition already gives $A \cap B \subseteq \overline{A} \cap B = \varnothing$,
so separated sets are disjoint. The converse fails: $(0,1)$ and $[1,2)$ are
disjoint, yet every neighbourhood of $1$ meets $(0,1)$, so $1$ is an adherent
point of $(0,1)$ and lies in $\overline{(0,1)}$
([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]]), while $1 \in [1,2)$; hence
$\overline{(0,1)} \cap [1,2) \ne \varnothing$ and the pair is not separated.
What separation adds to disjointness is exactly this: **neither set of a
separated pair may contain a point adherent to the other**, which is what makes
a disconnection a genuine splitting rather than a bookkeeping partition.

**Separation does not ask the two closures to be disjoint.** Each condition
tests one closure against the *other set*, never closure against closure. The
pair $(0,1)$, $(1,2)$ illustrates the difference and is separated: $[0,1]$ is a
closed set containing $(0,1)$, so $\overline{(0,1)} \subseteq [0,1]$
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]) and
$\overline{(0,1)} \cap (1,2) = \varnothing$; symmetrically
$\overline{(1,2)} \subseteq [1,2]$ and $(0,1) \cap \overline{(1,2)} =
\varnothing$. The two closures nevertheless share the point $1$, so a definition
demanding $\overline{A} \cap \overline{B} = \varnothing$ would be a different and
strictly stronger condition, and it is not the one used here.

## Remarks

- **Why separation and not "both pieces open".** For a subset $E$ of
  $\mathbb{R}$ the pieces of a splitting are rarely open as subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$: in the disconnection of $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,2]$ used by
  [[cex-rationals-in-an-interval-are-disconnected]] neither piece is open in
  $\mathbb{R}$. Rudin's separated-sets formulation avoids introducing a second
  topology relative to $E$, and it is the only formulation this page uses.
  Nothing below refers to sets open "in $E$".

- **Every one-point set and the empty set are connected.** A disconnection
  requires two nonempty pieces with union $E$, and if $E$ has at most one point
  no two nonempty disjoint sets have union $E$.

- **Connectedness of a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ turns out to be an order
  property**: $E$ is connected exactly when it is order-convex
  ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]]). That is a theorem about
  $\mathbb{R}$ and uses its completeness; the definition above mentions no order
  at all.

## Statement refuted

**Refuted claim:** the set $E := \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \cap [0,2]$ of rationals
between $0$ and $2$ is connected ([[def-connected-r]]), where
$\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is the copy of $\mathbb{Q}$ inside $\mathbb{R}$
([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

$E$ is bounded, and it contains **every rational** lying between its two
endpoints, so it is order-convex as a subset of the ordered field $\mathbb{Q}$:
it is an interval of that field. As a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ it is nevertheless
disconnected, split at the irrational point $\sqrt 2$. So the equivalence of
[[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]] genuinely uses the completeness of
$\mathbb{R}$, and "is an interval of the order it carries from $\mathbb{Q}$" is
not enough to make a set connected.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The copy $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$, the set $E := \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \cap [0,2]$, and the real $r$ with $r \ge 0$ and $r^2 = 2$.

[A1] The refuted claim: $E$ is connected.

[L1] Separated sets, disconnection and connectedness ([[def-connected-r]]).

[L2] $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed superset of $A$, so $\overline{A} \subseteq F$ for every closed $F \supseteq A$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]).

[L3] Each of $(-\infty, c]$ and $[c,\infty)$ is a closed set and each of $(-\infty,c)$ and $(c,\infty)$ is an open set ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L4] In a complete ordered field every $a \ge 0$ has a unique $s \ge 0$ with $s^2 = a$ ([[thm-of-square-roots]]).

[L5] No rational squares to $2$ ([[fs-sqrt2-rational]]); the map $q \mapsto \hat q$ is an injective embedding of ordered fields, so it preserves sums, products and the order ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]], [[def-rationals]]).

[L6] Squaring is strictly monotone on the nonnegatives: $0 \le a < b$ gives $a^2 < b^2$ ([[lem-of-square-monotone]]); $0 < 1$ and the order is total and transitive ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L7] A set is bounded when it has an upper and a lower bound ([[def-bounded-set]]).

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L4] there is a unique real $r \ge 0$ with $r^2 = 2$, and $0 < r < 2$: indeed $r \ne 0$ since $0^2 = 0 \ne 2$, while $r \ge 2$ would give $r^2 \ge 4 > 2$ by [L6]. [L4, L6]

1.2 $r \notin \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$: if $r = \hat q$ for a rational $q$, then $\widehat{q^2} = \hat q \cdot \hat q = r^2 = 2 = \hat 2$ by [L5], and injectivity of the embedding gives $q^2 = 2$ in $\mathbb{Q}$, contradicting [L5]. [L5]

1.3 $E$ is bounded, since $0 \le y \le 2$ for every $y \in E$ by the definition of $E$. [given, L7]

2.1 Put $A := E \cap (-\infty, r)$ and $B := E \cap (r, \infty)$. Then $A \cup B = E$, because every $y \in E$ satisfies $y \ne r$ by step 1.2 and hence $y < r$ or $y > r$; and both are nonempty, since $0 \in A$ and $2 \in B$ by step 1.1, both being rationals in $[0,2]$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L3, L5, L6]

3.1 $A$ and $B$ are separated: $(-\infty, r]$ is closed and contains $A$, so $\overline{A} \subseteq (-\infty,r]$ by [L2] and hence $\overline{A} \cap B \subseteq (-\infty,r] \cap (r,\infty) = \varnothing$; symmetrically $\overline{B} \subseteq [r,\infty)$ and $A \cap \overline{B} = \varnothing$. Hence $(A,B)$ is a disconnection of $E$ and $E$ is disconnected, so the claim [A1] is refuted. [step 2.1, A1, L1, L2, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the witness shows about
  [[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]].** That theorem says a subset of
  $\mathbb{R}$ is connected exactly when it is order-convex **in $\mathbb{R}$**.
  $E$ is not order-convex in $\mathbb{R}$: the point $r$ lies between $0$ and
  $2$ and is not in $E$. So no contradiction arises, and the example locates
  precisely what "interval" has to mean in the theorem: order-convex with
  respect to the complete order, not with respect to the order of a dense
  subfield.

- **Where completeness is spent in the theorem, and why it is absent here.** The
  proof of [[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]] produces a supremum, and
  that supremum is the point at which the two pieces of a would-be disconnection
  must meet. For $E$ the corresponding supremum is $r$, which exists in
  $\mathbb{R}$ and not in $\mathbb{Q}$; inside $\mathbb{Q}$ there is no point at
  which to detect the split, which is exactly why $E$ looks like an interval
  there.

- **The same phenomenon in a different guise** is
  [[cex-closed-bounded-in-q-not-compact]]: a set that behaves well inside
  $\mathbb{Q}$ because the real number that would spoil it is missing from
  $\mathbb{Q}$. In both cases the missing number is $\sqrt 2$.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with open and closed sets as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

- The **interior** of $A$ is the union of all open subsets of $A$:
  $$A^{\circ} \;:=\; \bigcup \{\, U \subseteq \mathbb{R} : U \text{ open and } U \subseteq A \,\}.$$
- The **closure** of $A$ is the intersection of all closed supersets of $A$:
  $$\overline{A} \;:=\; \bigcap \{\, F \subseteq \mathbb{R} : F \text{ closed and } A \subseteq F \,\}.$$
- The **boundary** of $A$ is $\partial A := \overline{A} \setminus A^{\circ}$.
- The **exterior** of $A$ is $\operatorname{ext} A := (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)^{\circ}$.

**Both operators are well defined and deliver what their names claim.** The
family whose union defines $A^{\circ}$ always contains $\varnothing$, and the
family whose intersection defines $\overline{A}$ always contains $\mathbb{R}$,
so the second family is nonempty and both expressions denote subsets of
$\mathbb{R}$ without appeal to any convention about empty unions or
intersections. Moreover:

- $A^{\circ}$ is **open**, being a union of open sets
  ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], claim 1), and $A^{\circ} \subseteq A$, since
  every set in the family is a subset of $A$. It is therefore the **largest**
  open subset of $A$: any open $U \subseteq A$ is a member of the family and so
  $U \subseteq A^{\circ}$.
- $\overline{A}$ is **closed**, being an intersection of a nonempty family of
  closed sets ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], claim 3), and $A \subseteq
  \overline{A}$, since every set in the family contains $A$. It is therefore the
  **smallest** closed superset of $A$: any closed $F \supseteq A$ is a member of
  the family and so $\overline{A} \subseteq F$.

**Pointwise description of the interior.** For $x \in \mathbb{R}$,

$$x \in A^{\circ} \iff \text{there is } \varepsilon > 0 \text{ with } N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A .$$

If $x \in A^{\circ}$ then, $A^{\circ}$ being open and containing $x$, there is
$\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A^{\circ} \subseteq A$.
Conversely if $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A$ then $N_\varepsilon(x)$ is an open
subset of $A$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) containing $x$, hence
$x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A^{\circ}$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

The corresponding pointwise description of the closure is not a definitional
matter and is proved separately, as [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

## Remarks

- **The four sets partition nothing by themselves, but three of them do.** For
  every $A$ the three sets $A^{\circ}$, $\partial A$ and $\operatorname{ext} A$
  are pairwise disjoint with union $\mathbb{R}$. This is not proved here and is
  not used on this page; what is used is only the definitions above and the
  characterisations of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

- **Interior and closure are dual.** Complementation exchanges the two families
  above, since $U$ is open exactly when $\mathbb{R} \setminus U$ is closed, so
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus A^{\circ} = \overline{\mathbb{R} \setminus A}$ and
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A} = (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)^{\circ} =
  \operatorname{ext} A$. The second identity is the reason the exterior is
  usually described as "the complement of the closure".

- **$A$ is open exactly when $A = A^{\circ}$, and closed exactly when
  $A = \overline{A}$.** For the first: $A^{\circ} \subseteq A$ always, and
  $A \subseteq A^{\circ}$ holds exactly when $A$ is one of the open subsets of
  $A$, that is, exactly when $A$ is open. The closure half is the same argument
  read the other way, and it is recorded as a claim of
  [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] because the rest of that theorem needs it.

- **Boundary points may or may not belong to the set.** $\partial (0,1) =
  \partial [0,1] = \{0,1\}$, and the two boundary points lie outside the first
  set and inside the second; the boundary sees only the way the set meets its
  complement, not which side the edge is assigned to.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]) and its absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]).

Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ with
$\varepsilon > 0$. The **$\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\},$$

and the **punctured $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \;=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}.$$

The two descriptions of $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ agree because $|y - x| = 0$ holds
exactly when $y = x$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**A neighbourhood is an open interval.** For every $x$ and every
$\varepsilon > 0$,

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;=\; (x - \varepsilon,\ x + \varepsilon),$$

the interval of [[def-interval]]. Indeed [[lem-of-abs-value]] gives, for
$\varepsilon > 0$, the equivalence $|y - x| < \varepsilon \iff -\varepsilon <
y - x < \varepsilon$, and adding $x$ throughout turns the right-hand side into
$x - \varepsilon < y < x + \varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**The centre lies in its own neighbourhoods.** $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, since
$|x - x| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**Punctured neighbourhoods are never empty.** The element
$y := x + \varepsilon/2$ satisfies $|y - x| = \varepsilon/2$, which is
$> 0$ and $< \varepsilon$, so $y \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$
([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

**Monotonicity in the radius.** If $0 < \delta \le \varepsilon$ then
$N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, because $|y - x| < \delta \le
\varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**Nesting at an interior point.** If $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and
$0 < \delta \le \varepsilon - |y - x|$, then

$$N_\delta(y) \;\subseteq\; N_\varepsilon(x).$$

Indeed for $z \in N_\delta(y)$ the triangle inequality
([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]) gives
$|z - x| = |(z - y) + (y - x)| \le |z - y| + |y - x| < \delta + |y - x| \le
\varepsilon$. Note that $\varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ precisely because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, so such a $\delta$ always exists.

## Remarks

- **The radius is a real number, not a rational.** Nothing on this page tests a
  condition against rational radii only. That convention belongs to
  [[def-real-limit]], where the quantifier is over rational $\varepsilon$ and
  the passage between the rational and the real form is the sanctioned remark of
  [[def-sequence]]. Here $\varepsilon$ ranges over the positive reals
  throughout, and every statement above is proved for an arbitrary positive
  real.

- **Why the punctured version is separated out.** A limit point of a set is a
  point every punctured neighbourhood of which meets the set
  ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and deleting the centre is exactly what stops a point
  of the set from qualifying automatically. The unpunctured condition defines
  the weaker notion of an adherent point, and the difference between the two is
  precisely an isolated point.

- **Nesting is the workhorse.** Almost every openness verification on this page
  has the shape "given $y$ in the set, shrink the radius by the distance
  already travelled", which is the nesting property above. It is recorded here
  once so that no later proof has to redo the triangle inequality in passing.

## Definition

Let $U, F \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]].

- $U$ is **open** when for every $x \in U$ there is a real $\varepsilon > 0$
  with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$.
- $F$ is **closed** when its complement $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open.
- A set is **clopen** when it is both open and closed.

The whole of the topology of $\mathbb{R}$ developed on this page rests on this
one definition: closedness is *defined* as openness of the complement, and every
other description of a closed set on this page is a theorem
([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]]).

**$\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen.** The condition defining openness
quantifies over the elements of the set, so it holds vacuously for
$\varnothing$; and for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ one has $N_1(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$,
so $\mathbb{R}$ is open. Since each of the two is the complement of the other,
each is also closed.

**Every neighbourhood is open.** Let $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and put
$\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x|$, which is $> 0$ because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$. The nesting property of [[def-neighbourhood-r]] gives
$N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$. So every point of $N_\varepsilon(x)$
has a neighbourhood inside it.

**The four open forms of [[def-interval]] are open sets.** Let $a, b \in
\mathbb{R}$.

- $(a,b)$: for $x$ with $a < x < b$, both $x - a > 0$ and $b - x > 0$, so
  $\delta := \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ is a positive real (the minimum of a
  two-element set of reals exists, [[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).
  If $|y - x| < \delta$ then $y > x - \delta \ge x - (x - a) = a$ and
  $y < x + \delta \le x + (b - x) = b$, so $y \in (a,b)$; hence
  $N_\delta(x) \subseteq (a,b)$.
- $(a,\infty)$: for $x > a$ take $\delta := x - a > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y > x - \delta = a$.
- $(-\infty,b)$: for $x < b$ take $\delta := b - x > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y < x + \delta = b$.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: already treated above.

**The four closed forms of [[def-interval]] are closed sets.** In each case the
complement is shown open directly.

- $[a,b]$: if $x \notin [a,b]$ then $x < a$ or $x > b$ by trichotomy
  ([[def-ordered-field]]). If $x < a$, take $\delta := a - x > 0$; every
  $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has $y < x + \delta = a$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. If
  $x > b$, take $\delta := x - b > 0$; every $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has
  $y > x - \delta = b$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. So
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus [a,b]$ is open.
- $[a,\infty)$: its complement is $(-\infty,a)$, which is open by the previous
  paragraph.
- $(-\infty,b]$: its complement is $(b,\infty)$, which is open.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: its complement is $\varnothing$, which is
  open.

## Remarks

- **Open and closed are not opposites, and not exhaustive.** A set may be
  neither: the half-open interval $[0,1)$ is neither open nor closed
  ([[fs-every-set-is-open-or-closed]]). A set may be both: $\varnothing$ and
  $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen. The words are inherited from the interval terminology
  of [[def-interval]], and the agreement between the two usages is exactly the
  two lists verified above: an interval called open there is an open set here,
  and an interval called closed there is a closed set here.

- **A clopen set is a disconnection waiting to happen.** If $A$ is clopen and
  both $A$ and $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ are nonempty, then each of the two is
  its own closure, so the two are separated in the sense of
  [[def-connected-r]] and $\mathbb{R} = A \cup (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)$ is a
  disconnection. Since $\mathbb{R}$ is order-convex it is connected
  ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]]), so no such $A$ exists:
  $\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are the only clopen subsets of $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The half-open forms are the ones the two lists omit**, and deliberately so:
  $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ with $a < b$ are neither open nor closed as subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The radius depends on the point.** Openness asks for *some* $\varepsilon$
  at each point, and that $\varepsilon$ may shrink to nothing as the point
  approaches the edge of the set, as the computation for $(a,b)$ shows: there
  $\delta = \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ tends to $0$ as $x$ tends to either endpoint.
  Asking instead for a single $\varepsilon$ that works simultaneously at every
  point of the set is a strictly stronger condition, and it is not what is
  defined here; nothing on this page uses it.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with closure $\overline{A}$ as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]] and derived set $A'$ as in
[[def-limit-point-r]]. Write

$$E \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing \text{ for every real } \varepsilon > 0 \,\}$$

for the set of adherent points of $A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). Then:

1. $\overline{A} = E$.
2. $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$.
3. $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed superset of $A$: it is closed, it
   contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed $F$ with $A \subseteq F$.
4. $A$ is closed if and only if $A = \overline{A}$, if and only if
   $A' \subseteq A$.

Claim 3 is the content of the definition of $\overline{A}$ and is restated here
so that the four descriptions stand together; claims 1, 2 and 4 are the ones
that carry work.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, and the set $E$ of adherent points of $A$ as displayed in the Statement.

[L1] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; $F$ is closed when $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L2] $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$; $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) = N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$; and if $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ then $\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ and $N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] $\overline{A}$ is the intersection of the nonempty family of closed supersets of $A$; it is closed, it contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed superset of $A$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]).

[L4] $x$ is an adherent point of $A$ when every $N_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $A$, a limit point when every $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $A$, and $A'$ is the set of limit points ([[def-limit-point-r]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $A \subseteq E$: for $x \in A$ and any $\varepsilon > 0$ one has $x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$, so that intersection is nonempty. [L2, L4]

1.2 Let $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus E$; by the definition of $E$ there is a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$. [L4, choose]

1.3 Let $F$ be closed with $A \subseteq F$, and let $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus F$; since $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open there is a real $\eta > 0$ with $N_\eta(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus F$. [L1, choose]

2.1 For every $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ the radius $\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x|$ is positive and $N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, so $N_\delta(y) \cap A = \varnothing$ and $y \notin E$; hence $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$, and since $x$ was an arbitrary point of $\mathbb{R} \setminus E$ that set is open, that is, $E$ is closed. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L4]

2.2 From $N_\eta(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus F \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus A$ we get $N_\eta(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, so $x \notin E$; hence $\mathbb{R} \setminus F \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$, that is, $E \subseteq F$, for every closed $F \supseteq A$. [step 1.3, L4]

3.1 By steps 1.1 and 2.1 the set $E$ is a closed superset of $A$, so $\overline{A} \subseteq E$ by the leastness in [L3]; and $\overline{A}$ is itself a closed superset of $A$ by [L3], so step 2.2 applied to $F = \overline{A}$ gives $E \subseteq \overline{A}$. Hence $\overline{A} = E$, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, L3]

4.1 $E = A \cup A'$: if $x \in E$ and $x \notin A$ then for every $\varepsilon > 0$ some $a \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ exists, and $a \ne x$ because $x \notin A$, so $a \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ and $x \in A'$; conversely $A \subseteq E$ by step 1.1, and $A' \subseteq E$ because $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$. Combining with step 3.1 gives $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$, which is claim 2. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L2, L4]

5.1 Claim 4: if $A$ is closed then $A$ is a closed superset of itself, so $\overline{A} \subseteq A$ by [L3], while $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ by [L3], whence $A = \overline{A}$; conversely if $A = \overline{A}$ then $A$ is closed because $\overline{A}$ is. Finally $A = \overline{A}$ says $A = A \cup A'$ by step 4.1, and $A = A \cup A'$ holds exactly when $A' \subseteq A$. [step 4.1, L3]

6.1 Claim 3 is [L3] restated, and claims 1, 2 and 4 are steps 3.1, 4.1 and 5.1, so all four hold. [step 3.1, step 4.1, step 5.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Which claim does the work in practice.** Claim 1 is the one used almost
  everywhere below: to show a point lies in $\overline{A}$ one exhibits, for each
  $\varepsilon > 0$, a point of $A$ within $\varepsilon$ of it. Claim 2 is what
  separates the two ways a point can be adherent, by membership or by
  accumulation, and it is what makes the notion of an isolated point visible.

- **No special property of $\mathbb{R}$ is used.** The argument uses the
  definitions of open, closed, neighbourhood and closure, and the order enters
  only through the nesting property of neighbourhoods; neither the
  least-upper-bound property nor the Archimedean property appears at any step.
  The results of this page that do use them are flagged in
  [[rem-r-native-topology-scope]].

- **The sequential form is a separate theorem and costs more.** Replacing
  "every neighbourhood meets $A$" by "some sequence in $A$ converges to $x$" is
  [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]], and the passage from the
  first to the second spends the axiom of countable choice, since it selects one
  point of $A$ from each of infinitely many neighbourhoods. The characterisation
  proved above is choice free.

only if $E$ is **order-convex** ([[def-interval]]), that is, if and only if

$$x, z \in E \text{ and } x \le w \le z \;\Longrightarrow\; w \in E .$$

**On the word "interval".** Order-convexity is exactly the defining property
that [[def-interval]] proves for each of its nine forms, and in that sense the
theorem says that the connected subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ are the intervals. The
converse classification, that every order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty
or one of the nine forms, is true and is explicitly **not proved anywhere in
this library**; [[def-interval]] records that omission in its own remarks. So
the statement proved below is the equivalence with order-convexity, and the
phrase "is an interval" is to be read as "is order-convex" throughout this page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] Separated sets, disconnection, connectedness; separated sets are disjoint ([[def-connected-r]]).

[L2] $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed superset of $A$, so $A \subseteq B$ gives $\overline{A} \subseteq \overline{B}$ and $\overline{A} \subseteq F$ for every closed $F \supseteq A$; and $\overline{A}$ is exactly the set of points every neighbourhood of which meets $A$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]).

[L3] Order-convexity, and the interval forms: $(-\infty,w]$ and $[w,\infty)$ are closed sets, $(-\infty,w)$ and $(w,\infty)$ are open sets, and the order is total and transitive ([[def-interval]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L4] Least-upper-bound property: a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ bounded above has a unique least upper bound ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-sup-unique]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L5] Epsilon characterisation: for nonempty $S$ bounded above and $c = \sup S$, every $\varepsilon > 0$ admits $s \in S$ with $c - \varepsilon < s$ ([[lem-sup-epsilon]]).

[L6] $N_\varepsilon(x) = \{\, y : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L7] Every nonempty finite set of reals has a minimum, which is one of its members ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L8] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 := 1+1 > 0$ and $2^{-1} > 0$; for $d > 0$ one has $0 < d \cdot 2^{-1} < d$; adding a constant preserves an inequality ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Suppose $E$ is not order-convex: there are $x, z \in E$ and $w \in \mathbb{R}$ with $x \le w \le z$ and $w \notin E$; then $w \ne x$ and $w \ne z$, so $x < w < z$. Put $A := E \cap (-\infty,w)$ and $B := E \cap (w,\infty)$; then $x \in A$ and $z \in B$, so both are nonempty, and $A \cup B = E$ because no element of $E$ equals $w$. [assume-hyp, L3]

1.2 Suppose instead that $E$ is order-convex and that $(A,B)$ is a disconnection of $E$; fix $p \in A$ and $q \in B$. Separated sets are disjoint by [L1], so $p \ne q$, and interchanging the names $A$ and $B$ if necessary, which is legitimate because the hypotheses on the pair are symmetric, we may assume $p < q$. [assume-hyp, L1, choose]

1.3 For a nonempty $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ bounded above, $\sup S \in \overline{S}$: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the fact [L5] supplies $s \in S$ with $\sup S - \varepsilon < s \le \sup S$, so $|s - \sup S| < \varepsilon$ and $s \in N_\varepsilon(\sup S) \cap S$; thus every neighbourhood of $\sup S$ meets $S$, and [L2] gives $\sup S \in \overline{S}$. [L2, L4, L5, L6]

2.1 In the situation of step 1.1 the pair $(A,B)$ is a disconnection: $(-\infty,w]$ is a closed set containing $A$, so $\overline{A} \subseteq (-\infty,w]$ by [L2], whence $\overline{A} \cap B \subseteq (-\infty,w] \cap (w,\infty) = \varnothing$; symmetrically $\overline{B} \subseteq [w,\infty)$ and $A \cap \overline{B} = \varnothing$. So $A$ and $B$ are separated, nonempty, and their union is $E$, and $E$ is disconnected. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L3]

2.2 In the situation of step 1.2 put $S := A \cap [p,q]$; it is nonempty because $p \in A$ and $p \le p \le q$, and it is bounded above by $q$, so $c := \sup S$ exists by [L4], and $p \le c \le q$ since $p \in S$ and $q$ is an upper bound. [step 1.2, L3, L4]

3.1 $c \in A$: from $S \subseteq A$ and [L2] we get $\overline{S} \subseteq \overline{A}$, and $c \in \overline{S}$ by step 1.3, so $c \in \overline{A}$ and hence $c \notin B$ because $\overline{A} \cap B = \varnothing$; on the other hand $p \le c \le q$ with $p, q \in E$ and $E$ order-convex gives $c \in E = A \cup B$, so $c \in A$. [step 1.2, step 1.3, step 2.2, L1, L2]

4.1 $c < q$, since $c \in A$ and $q \in B$ are distinct by [L1] while $c \le q$; and every $v$ with $c < v \le q$ lies in $B$: such a $v$ satisfies $p \le c < v \le q$, so $v \in E$ by order-convexity, and $v \notin A$, for otherwise $v \in A \cap [p,q] = S$ would force $v \le c$. [step 1.2, step 2.2, step 3.1, L1, L3]

5.1 $c \in \overline{B}$, which is impossible: given a real $\varepsilon > 0$, put $t := \min\{\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1},\ (q - c) \cdot 2^{-1}\}$, a positive real by [L7] and [L8] since $q - c > 0$, and $v := c + t$; then $c < v$ and $v \le c + (q-c) \cdot 2^{-1} < q$, so $v \in B$ by step 4.1, while $|v - c| = t \le \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} < \varepsilon$, so $v \in N_\varepsilon(c) \cap B$. Hence every neighbourhood of $c$ meets $B$ and $c \in \overline{B}$ by [L2]; but $c \in A$ by step 3.1 and $A \cap \overline{B} = \varnothing$ by [L1]. So the assumed disconnection cannot exist and an order-convex $E$ is connected. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L1, L2, L6, L7, L8]

6.1 Step 2.1 shows that a set which is not order-convex is disconnected, hence a connected set is order-convex; step 5.1 shows that an order-convex set admits no disconnection, hence is connected. The two together are the asserted equivalence. [step 2.1, step 5.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where completeness is spent.** Only in step 2.2, which produces
  $\sup(A \cap [p,q])$; no other step uses the least-upper-bound property, and
  the rest is the order, ordered-field arithmetic and the definition of
  separation. The obstruction over an incomplete ordered field is traceable to
  the failure of that supremum to exist, and it is visible in
  [[cex-rationals-in-an-interval-are-disconnected]]: the set
  $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,2]$ contains all the rationals between its endpoints and is
  nevertheless disconnected as a subset of $\mathbb{R}$, split at an irrational
  point that $\mathbb{Q}$ does not see.

- **The two directions are of different characters.** "Not order-convex implies
  disconnected" is a construction, step 1.1, and needs nothing beyond the order.
  "Order-convex implies connected" is where the work sits, and the supremum
  $c$ produced in step 2.2 is the point at which the two pieces would have to
  meet; the contradiction is that it is adherent to both.

- **The theorem is about subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ and its statement is written in
  order vocabulary**, so it cannot even be stated where no order is present;
  [[rem-r-native-topology-scope]] collects the results on this page with that
  feature.
