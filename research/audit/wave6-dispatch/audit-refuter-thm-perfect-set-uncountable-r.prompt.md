You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as a
read-only adversarial proof-refuter for the published-page audit. You are
tool-less: you cannot open a file, run a command, browse, edit, or delegate.
Everything you may rely on is reproduced in the `This dispatch` section. Return
evidence only; Audit-Alpha alone adjudicates and edits.

## Triage — the standing rule (verbatim, binding on you)

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct
  citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

## Adversarial standard

Read the target's title, Statement/Definition/Example/Statement refuted, Facts &
Assumptions, every numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks.
Try to falsify the public claim and every load-bearing inference.

1. Compare every cited fact with the supplied source text before alleging that
   it is weak. Check domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, direction, conclusion,
   and whether the source licenses the exact use.
2. Check that the title and public statement assert no more than the proof
   establishes, and that every proof step uses only available premises.
3. Check both directions of biconditionals, uniqueness/existence claims,
   induction and limiting arguments, empty/zero/endpoint/degenerate cases,
   extended-real conventions, index shifts, and hidden division or choice.
4. Re-read Remarks as skeptically as a numbered step. A false mathematical
   remark is a defect even when the proof is sound.
5. When the target is marked `ai-generated`, actively search for a
   counterexample to its claim, witness, or refutation rather than merely
   checking prose consistency.
6. Treat a false public claim, logically invalid proof, missing necessary
   hypothesis, circularity, or materially inaccurate load-bearing citation as
   fatal. Do not inflate an expository omission or a gap closable within thirty
   seconds into a defect.

## Output format

## Statement

Let $P \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be nonempty and perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]).
Then $P$ is uncountable ([[def-countable]]).

**The selection is canonical, so that this proof spends no dependent choice.**
The textbook proof shrinks a neighbourhood at every stage by *choosing* a point
of $P$ and then a radius, a choice made infinitely often and each time depending
on the previous one: that is the axiom of dependent choice
([[def-dependent-choice]]), which is not available at this point in the reading
order; only the axiom of countable choice is, and it does not
licence a recursive selection. The construction below therefore fixes an
enumeration $e$ of the rationals once ([[thm-rationals-countable]],
[[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) and, at every stage, takes the interval with
**least-indexed rational endpoints** meeting the requirements. The requirements
are met by some rational-endpoint interval, which is what step 2.1 proves, and
the least such index is determined by [[thm-well-ordering-principle]], so the
whole recursion is a single application of [[thm-recursion]] to a total map and
no choice principle is used anywhere.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A nonempty perfect set $P \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Write $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the image of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ under $q \mapsto \hat q$. A pair $(p,q) \in \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \times \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is called **good** when $p < q$ and $(p,q) \cap P \ne \varnothing$, and $G$ denotes the set of good pairs.

[L1] $P$ is perfect: $P$ is closed and every $x \in P$ is a limit point of $P$, so every punctured neighbourhood of $x$ meets $P$ ([[def-perfect-set-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L2] $\overline{A}$ is the set of points every neighbourhood of which meets $A$, and $A$ is closed exactly when $A = \overline{A}$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L3] $N_\varepsilon(x) = (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon)$; $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$; $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) = N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\}$; and $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ with $0 < \delta \le \varepsilon - |y - x|$ gives $N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L4] Intervals: $(p,q)$ is an open set and $[p,q]$ is a closed bounded interval, nonempty when $p \le q$ ([[def-interval]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L5] A nonempty at most countable set admits a surjection from $\mathbb{N}$; uncountable means not at most countable ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]], [[def-countable]]).

[L6] $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-rationals-countable]]); $q \mapsto \hat q$ is injective with image $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and strictly between any two reals lies an element of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]); a composition of bijections is a bijection ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]], [[def-equinumerous]]).

[L7] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L8] Recursion: for a set $Y$, an element $y_0 \in Y$ and a function $T : Y \to Y$ there is $h : \mathbb{N} \to Y$ with $h(0) = y_0$ and $h(\sigma(k)) = T(h(k))$ ([[thm-recursion]]).

[L9] Nested interval property: for nonempty closed bounded intervals $I_k = [a_k,b_k]$ with $I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k$, the intersection is nonempty, and it is a single point exactly when the lengths $b_k - a_k$ tend to $0$ ([[thm-nested-interval-property]]).

[L10] Reciprocal Archimedean property: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]]); canonical naturals are positive and increasing, and reciprocation of positives reverses the order ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

[L11] Every nonempty finite set of reals has a minimum, which is one of its members ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]); $0 < 1$, so $2 := 1+1 > 0$ and $0 < d \cdot 2^{-1} < d$ for $d > 0$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve inequalities ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

[L12] Convergence of a sequence of reals to $0$ is tested against rational $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-real-limit]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L13] Absolute value: $|z| \ge 0$, and $|y - x| \le b - a$ whenever $x, y \in [a,b]$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that the nonempty perfect set $P$ is at most countable; by [L5] fix a surjection $f : \mathbb{N} \to P$. [assume-contra, L5, choose]

1.2 By [L6] fix a bijection $\beta : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$ and put $e := \iota \circ \beta$ with $\iota(q) = \hat q$, a bijection from $\mathbb{N}$ onto $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$. [L6, choose]

1.3 Recall the terminology of the Given: a pair $(p,q)$ of elements of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is good when $p < q$ and $(p,q) \cap P \ne \varnothing$, and $G$ is the set of good pairs. [given, construct]

2.1 **Refinement claim.** For every good $(p,q)$, every $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and every real $\eta > 0$ there is a good $(p',q')$ with $[p',q'] \subseteq (p,q)$, $x \notin [p',q']$ and $q' - p' < \eta$. To see it, fix $y \in (p,q) \cap P$ and, $(p,q)$ being open, a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(y) \subseteq (p,q)$; since $y \in P$ is not isolated, [L1] gives $z \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(y) \cap P$, so $z \in P \cap (p,q)$ and $z \ne y$. At least one of $y, z$ differs from $x$; let $w$ be $y$ if $y \ne x$ and $z$ otherwise, so $w \in P \cap N_\varepsilon(y)$ and $w \ne x$. Put $\delta := \min\{\, \varepsilon - |w - y|,\ |w - x|,\ \eta \cdot 2^{-1} \,\}$, a positive real by [L11] since each entry is positive, and use [L6] to fix $p', q' \in \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ with $w - \delta < p' < w < q' < w + \delta$. Then $[p',q'] \subseteq N_\delta(w) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(y) \subseteq (p,q)$ by [L3], the pair $(p',q')$ is good because $w \in (p',q') \cap P$, the point $x$ lies outside $N_\delta(w)$ because $|x - w| \ge \delta$, and $q' - p' < 2\delta \le \eta$. [step 1.3, L1, L3, L4, L6, L11, choose]

3.1 **Successor rule.** For $(k,(p,q)) \in \mathbb{N} \times G$ let $m$ be the least natural for which some natural $n$ makes $(e(m),e(n))$ good with $[e(m),e(n)] \subseteq (p,q)$, $f(k) \notin [e(m),e(n)]$ and $e(n) - e(m) < 1/(k+1)$, and let $n$ be the least natural with those properties for that $m$; put $T(k,(p,q)) := (\sigma(k), (e(m),e(n)))$. The set of eligible $m$ is nonempty by step 2.1 applied with $x = f(k)$ and $\eta = 1/(k+1) > 0$, since $e$ is onto $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, so both minima exist by [L7] and $T : \mathbb{N} \times G \to \mathbb{N} \times G$ is a total function defined without any selection. [step 2.1, L6, L7, L10, construct]

4.1 **The recursion.** $P$ is nonempty, so fix $y_0 \in P$ and, by [L6], elements $p_0 < y_0 < q_0$ of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$; then $(p_0,q_0)$ is good. Apply [L8] with $Y = \mathbb{N} \times G$, seed $(0,(p_0,q_0))$ and map $T$ to get $h : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times G$ with $h(0) = (0,(p_0,q_0))$ and $h(\sigma(k)) = T(h(k))$; an induction on $k$ shows the first coordinate of $h(k)$ is $k$, so write $h(k) = (k,(p_k,q_k))$ with every $(p_k,q_k)$ good. [step 1.3, step 3.1, L6, L8, construct]

5.1 Writing $I_k := [p_k,q_k]$ and $\ell_k := q_k - p_k > 0$, the rule of step 3.1 gives, for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$: $I_{k+1} \subseteq (p_k,q_k) \subseteq I_k$, so the intervals are nested and nonempty; $f(k) \notin I_{k+1}$; $\ell_{k+1} < 1/(k+1)$; and $I_k \cap P \ne \varnothing$, because $(p_k,q_k) \cap P \ne \varnothing$. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L4]

6.1 For every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $k \ge 1$ with $\ell_k < \varepsilon$, and moreover $\ell_k \to 0$: by step 5.1 one has $\ell_j < 1/j$ for every $j \ge 1$, since $\ell_j = \ell_{(j-1)+1} < 1/((j-1)+1) = 1/j$; given $\varepsilon > 0$, [L10] supplies a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$, and then every $k \ge n$ satisfies $k \ge 1$ and $|\ell_k - 0| = \ell_k < 1/k \le 1/n < \varepsilon$ by [L10] and [L13], which is both assertions, the second by [L12] since a rational $\varepsilon > 0$ is in particular a real one. [step 5.1, L10, L12, L13]

7.1 By [L9] the nested family $(I_k)$ of nonempty closed bounded intervals has an intersection that is a single point, since its lengths tend to $0$ by step 6.1; write $\{x\}$ for it, so $x \in I_k$ for every $k$. [step 5.1, step 6.1, L9]

8.1 $x \in P$: let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real and use step 6.1 to fix $k \ge 1$ with $\ell_k < \varepsilon$; by step 5.1 there is $y \in I_k \cap P$, and $x \in I_k$ by step 7.1, so $|y - x| \le \ell_k < \varepsilon$ by [L13] and $y \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap P$. Every neighbourhood of $x$ therefore meets $P$, so $x \in \overline{P} = P$ by [L1] and [L2]. [step 5.1, step 6.1, step 7.1, L1, L2, L3, L13]

9.1 For every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ one has $x \in I_{k+1}$ by step 7.1 while $f(k) \notin I_{k+1}$ by step 5.1, so $x \ne f(k)$; thus the element $x$ of $P$ found in step 8.1 is not a value of $f$, contradicting the surjectivity of the $f$ fixed in step 1.1. The assumption is therefore untenable: a nonempty perfect subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is not at most countable, that is, it is uncountable. [step 1.1, step 5.1, step 7.1, step 8.1, L5, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Which hypothesis does what.** Closedness of $P$ is used exactly once, at the
  step that puts the limit point $x$ back into $P$; without it the construction
  still produces a point, but that point may lie outside $P$ and the
  contradiction evaporates. Having no isolated points is used exactly once, in
  the refinement claim, to produce a second point of $P$ inside a neighbourhood,
  which is what allows the excluded point $f(k)$ to be dodged. Nonemptiness is
  used to seed the recursion, and it cannot be dropped: $\varnothing$ is perfect
  and countable ([[def-perfect-set-r]]).

- **Why rational endpoints.** They are what make the construction canonical.
  The requirement "some good rational-endpoint interval inside $(p,q)$ misses
  $f(k)$ and is short" is a property of a pair of natural numbers, so it can be
  minimised by [[thm-well-ordering-principle]]; the same requirement stated for
  arbitrary real endpoints comes with no canonical least witness, and picking one
  would be a choice made afresh at every stage. This is the same device that
  keeps
  [[lem-subset-of-countable]] and [[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]] choice
  free, transplanted from subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ to intervals.

- **The shrinking condition is $\ell_{k+1} < 1/(k+1)$ and not $1/k$.** Sequences
  and recursions here are indexed from $0$ ([[def-sequence]]), so the bound
  available at stage $k$ has to be positive at $k = 0$; $1/k$ is undefined
  there. The consequence, $\ell_j < 1/j$ for $j \ge 1$, is what step 6.1 uses,
  and it says nothing about $\ell_0$, which is not needed.

- **The result is sharp in both directions.** A nondegenerate closed interval is
  perfect and uncountable ([[ex-closed-interval-is-perfect]]), and deleting the
  no-isolated-points clause loses the conclusion: a closed set with an isolated
  point need not be perfect
  ([[cex-closed-set-with-an-isolated-point-is-not-perfect]]) and may be
  countable, as $\{\, 1/k : k \ge 1 \,\} \cup \{0\}$ is
  ([[ex-reciprocals-with-zero-are-compact]]). Applied to a
  nondegenerate closed interval, which [[ex-closed-interval-is-perfect]] shows
  to be perfect, the theorem reproves the uncountability of intervals
  ([[cor-interval-uncountable]]) by a different route; the two proofs share
  nothing but the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$, which
  [[cor-interval-uncountable]] spends as a supremum and the argument above
  spends through [[thm-nested-interval-property]].

## Statement refuted

**Refuted claim:** every closed subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is perfect
([[def-perfect-set-r]]).

The witness is $E := \{0\} \cup [1,2]$. It is closed, being a union of two
closed sets ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]), and $0$ is an isolated point of it
([[def-limit-point-r]]), so the second clause of the definition of a perfect set
fails while the first holds.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The set $E := \{0\} \cup [1,2]$, where $\{0\} = [0,0]$ and $[1,2]$ are closed bounded intervals ([[def-interval]]).

[A1] The refuted claim: every closed subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is perfect.

[L1] A set is perfect when it is closed and no point of it is isolated in it; $x \in P$ is isolated in $P$ when some $N_\varepsilon(x)$ satisfies $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap P = \{x\}$ ([[def-perfect-set-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L2] Each interval of the form $[a,b]$ is a closed set, and a union of finitely many closed sets is closed ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-interval]], [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]).

[L3] $N_\varepsilon(x) = \{\, y : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}$, and $|y| = y$ for $y \ge 0$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L4] $0 < 1$, so $2 := 1 + 1 > 0$ and $0 < 1 \cdot 2^{-1} < 1$; the order is total and transitive ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $E$ is closed: $\{0\} = [0,0]$ and $[1,2]$ are closed sets by [L2], and their union is closed by [L2]. So $E$ is a legitimate instance of the claim [A1]. [A1, L2]

1.2 $0$ is an isolated point of $E$: certainly $0 \in E$; put $\varepsilon := 1 \cdot 2^{-1}$, which is positive and $< 1$ by [L4]. An element $y$ of $E$ is $0$ or lies in $[1,2]$, and in the second case $|y - 0| = y \ge 1 > \varepsilon$ by [L3] and [L4], so $y \notin N_\varepsilon(0)$. Hence $N_\varepsilon(0) \cap E = \{0\}$. [L1, L3, L4]

2.1 By step 1.2 the closed set $E$ of step 1.1 has an isolated point, so it is not perfect by [L1], and the claim [A1] is refuted. [step 1.1, step 1.2, A1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Only the second clause fails, and by one point.** Every point of $[1,2]$ is
  a limit point of $E$, by the computation in
  [[ex-closed-interval-is-perfect]]; the single point $0$ is what stops $E$ from
  being perfect. Deleting it leaves $[1,2]$, which is perfect.

- **Countability is the visible consequence.** A nonempty perfect set is
  uncountable ([[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]]). $E$ is uncountable too, since
  it contains $[1,2]$, so this example does not separate the two notions by
  size; what it shows is that closedness alone does not give perfectness. A
  countable closed set with isolated points is
  $\{\, 1/k : k \ge 1 \,\} \cup \{0\}$ ([[ex-reciprocals-with-zero-are-compact]]),
  and it is likewise not perfect.

- **The empty set is the degenerate case on the other side.** It is closed and
  has no isolated points, hence is perfect, and it is countable; that is why
  [[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]] assumes its perfect set is nonempty.

## Statement

Let $F$ be a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and let
$\varepsilon \in F$ with $\varepsilon > 0$. Then there is a natural number
$n \ge 1$ such that

$$\frac{1}{n \cdot 1_F} < \varepsilon ,$$

where $n \cdot 1_F$ is the canonical natural of $F$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]]) and
$1/(n \cdot 1_F)$ is its multiplicative inverse ([[def-field]]). As is standard
we abbreviate $n \cdot 1_F$ to $n$ and write the conclusion $1/n < \varepsilon$.

This is the **reciprocal form** of the Archimedean property.
[[thm-of-archimedean]] on its own delivers only the assertion that the canonical
naturals are cofinal, $x < n \cdot 1_F$; the form actually used in analysis, that
the reciprocals of the naturals get below every positive bound, is the statement
above, and it is recorded separately so that no proof has to reconstruct the
inversion step in passing.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $F$ and an element $\varepsilon \in F$ with $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] Archimedean property: for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Inverses and order: if $a > 0$ then $a^{-1} > 0$, and if $0 < a < b$ then $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Field arithmetic: an element $a$ with $a > 0$ is nonzero by trichotomy, hence has a multiplicative inverse $a^{-1}$, and $(a^{-1})^{-1} = a$ ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Since $\varepsilon > 0$, trichotomy gives $\varepsilon \ne 0$, so $\varepsilon^{-1}$ exists, and $\varepsilon^{-1} > 0$. [given, L2, L3]

2.1 Apply [L1] to $x = \varepsilon^{-1}$: fix a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $\varepsilon^{-1} < n \cdot 1_F$. [step 1.1, L1, choose]

3.1 Chaining the two displayed inequalities gives $0 < \varepsilon^{-1} < n \cdot 1_F$; in particular $n \cdot 1_F > 0$, so $n \cdot 1_F \ne 0$ and $1/(n \cdot 1_F)$ is defined. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L3]

4.1 Apply the second claim of [L2] with $a = \varepsilon^{-1}$ and $b = n \cdot 1_F$: $0 < (n \cdot 1_F)^{-1} < (\varepsilon^{-1})^{-1}$. [step 3.1, L2]

5.1 By [L3], $(\varepsilon^{-1})^{-1} = \varepsilon$, so the natural number $n \ge 1$ fixed in step 2.1 satisfies $1/(n \cdot 1_F) < \varepsilon$, which is the assertion. [step 4.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Monotonicity gives the eventual form for free.** If $m \ge n \ge 1$ then
  $m \cdot 1_F \ge n \cdot 1_F > 0$, because $k \mapsto k \cdot 1_F$ is strictly
  increasing on the naturals $\ge 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]), and so
  $1/(m \cdot 1_F) \le 1/(n \cdot 1_F) < \varepsilon$ by [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]
  again. So the corollary yields not merely one index but a threshold: every
  $m \ge n$ satisfies $1/m < \varepsilon$. That one extra line is what a
  convergence proof needs, and it is left to the caller rather than folded into
  the statement, because the caller usually has a threshold of its own to combine
  it with.

- **Completeness is used only through [[thm-of-archimedean]].** Nothing here
  needs the least-upper-bound property directly. The corollary therefore holds
  verbatim in any Archimedean ordered field, in particular in $\mathbb{Q}$, and
  it fails in a non-Archimedean ordered field, where an infinitesimal
  $\varepsilon > 0$ is below every $1/n$ by construction.

- The equivalence is exact: the reciprocal form implies the cofinal form back
  again, since given $x > 0$ one applies it to $\varepsilon = 1/x$. The two are
  the same property written on the two sides of the inversion, and only the
  direction proved above is used in this library.

## Statement

Let $\mathbb{R}$ be a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and
let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$. Then both

1. the closed interval $[a,b] = \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : a \le x \le b \,\}$, and
2. the open interval $(a,b) = \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : a < x < b \,\}$

are uncountable ([[def-countable]]).

**What this adds to [[thm-r-uncountable]], and what it does not inherit from it.**
That theorem states exactly one thing: $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable. Its statement
says nothing about any interval, so the present result cannot be read off it. Its
*proof*, on the other hand, is general in every part but its seed: the trisection
rule of its step 2.1 is constructed there for an arbitrary $(a,b) \in I$, and its
steps 4.1, 5.1 and 6.1, together with the interval reasoning of its step 7.1, use
nothing about the starting interval beyond the nesting and the strictness
$a_n < b_n$ that the rule delivers. Only three places are special to $\mathbb{R}$
and to $(0,1)$: the surjection of its step 1.1 is onto $\mathbb{R}$, the recursion
of its step 3.1 is seeded at $(0,(0,1))$, and the conclusion drawn in its step 7.1
is about $\mathbb{R}$. So the construction is re-run below, seeded
instead at the **middle third** of $(a,b)$, against a surjection onto $(a,b)$; the
remarks record why that seed and not $(a,b)$ itself.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $\mathbb{R}$, with $0 \ne 1$ and the order of [[def-ordered-field]]. For $u \le v$ write $[u,v] = \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : u \le x \le v \,\}$ and $(u,v) = \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : u < x < v \,\}$, and write $I = \{\, (u,v) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} : u < v \,\}$ for the set of pairs coding nondegenerate closed intervals.

[L1] Least-upper-bound property: every nonempty $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound $\sup S$, an upper bound below every upper bound ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L2] The least upper bound is unique when it exists ([[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L3] Epsilon characterisation: for a nonempty $S$ bounded above and an upper bound $u$ of $S$, $u = \sup S$ if and only if for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $s \in S$ with $u - \varepsilon < s$ ([[lem-sup-epsilon]]).

[L4] Order and arithmetic in an ordered field: $0 < 1$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]); $a < b$ implies $a + c < b + c$, and $a < b$ with $c < d$ implies $a + c < b + d$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]); $a > 0$ implies $a^{-1} > 0$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]); a product of positives is positive ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]); the order is transitive and satisfies trichotomy ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] Recursion: for any set $X$, $x_0 \in X$ and $F : X \to X$ there is $h : \mathbb{N} \to X$ with $h(0) = x_0$ and $h(\sigma(n)) = F(h(n))$ ([[thm-recursion]]).

[L6] Induction ([[thm-induction-principle]]); any two naturals are comparable ([[lem-nat-trichotomy]]); the order of $\mathbb{N}$ is the additive one, $m \le n$ meaning $m + k = n$ for some $k$ ([[def-nat-order]], [[def-natural-numbers]]), and it satisfies $n < \sigma(n)$ and $m < \sigma(n) \iff m \le n$ ([[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]), so $m \le \sigma(n)$ holds exactly when $m \le n$ or $m = \sigma(n)$.

[L7] A nonempty set is at most countable if and only if some surjection from $\mathbb{N}$ onto it exists; uncountable means not at most countable ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]], [[def-countable]]).

[L8] Every subset of an at most countable set is at most countable ([[lem-subset-of-countable]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that the conclusion fails: there are $a < b$ in $\mathbb{R}$ for which $[a,b]$ is at most countable or $(a,b)$ is at most countable. Fix such a pair. Since $(a,b) \subseteq [a,b]$, in the first case [L8] makes $(a,b)$ at most countable too, so in either case $(a,b)$ is at most countable. [assume-contra, L7, L8]

1.2 Put $3 := 1 + 1 + 1$. Adding the inequality $0 < 1$ to itself twice gives $3 > 0$ by [L4], so $3 \ne 0$ and $3^{-1} > 0$; hence for $d > 0$ the element $d/3 := d \cdot 3^{-1}$ is positive, and $d/3 + d/3 + d/3 = d \cdot 3^{-1} \cdot 3 = d$. [L4, algebra]

2.1 Fix the trisection rule. Let $(u,v) \in I$ and $y \in \mathbb{R}$. Put $d = v - u > 0$, $s = u + d/3$ and $t = s + d/3$; then $u < s < t < v$ by step 1.2 and [L4], since $s - u = t - s = v - t = d/3 > 0$. The three pairs $(u,s)$, $(s,t)$, $(t,v)$ all lie in $I$ and their intervals are contained in $[u,v]$. Moreover $[u,s]$ and $[t,v]$ are disjoint, because $x \le s < t \le x$ is impossible; so $y$ fails to lie in at least one of the three. Define $T(u,v,y)$ to be the **first** of $(u,s)$, $(s,t)$, $(t,v)$, in that fixed order, whose interval does not contain $y$. This is a definition by cases on the three conditions $y \in [u,s]$, $y \in [s,t]$, $y \in [t,v]$, so $T : I \times \mathbb{R} \to I$ is a function and no choice is made. [step 1.2, L4, construct]

3.1 Trisect the fixed interval. Put $d_0 = b - a > 0$, $p = a + d_0/3$ and $q = p + d_0/3$; then $a < p < q < b$ by step 1.2 and [L4], exactly as in step 2.1 applied to $(a,b)$. Hence $(p,q) \in I$, and $[p,q] \subseteq (a,b)$, since $p \le x \le q$ gives $a < p \le x \le q < b$. In particular $p \in (a,b)$, so $(a,b)$ is nonempty. [step 1.2, L4]

4.1 By step 1.1 the set $(a,b)$ is at most countable, and by step 3.1 it is nonempty, so [L7] provides a surjection $g : \mathbb{N} \to (a,b)$. Composing with the inclusion $(a,b) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ regards $g$ as a function $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with $f(n) = g(n)$ for every $n$. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L7]

5.1 Apply [L5] with $X = \mathbb{N} \times I$, $x_0 = (0, (p,q))$, which lies in $X$ because $p < q$ by step 3.1, and $F(n, (u,v)) = (\sigma(n), T(u, v, f(n)))$: this yields $h : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times I$ with $h(0) = x_0$ and $h(\sigma(n)) = F(h(n))$. An induction using [L6] shows the first coordinate of $h(n)$ is $n$, so we may write $h(n) = (n, (a_n, b_n))$ with $a_n < b_n$, $a_0 = p$, $b_0 = q$ and $(a_{\sigma(n)}, b_{\sigma(n)}) = T(a_n, b_n, f(n))$ for every $n$. By step 2.1 this gives $a_n \le a_{\sigma(n)}$, $b_{\sigma(n)} \le b_n$ and $f(n) \notin [a_{\sigma(n)}, b_{\sigma(n)}]$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, step 4.1, L4, L5, L6, construct]

6.1 For $m \le n$ one has $a_m \le a_n$ and $b_n \le b_m$, by induction on $n$ using step 5.1 and transitivity; consequently $a_m \le b_n$ for all $m, n$: if $m \le n$ then $a_m \le a_n < b_n$, and if $n \le m$ then $a_m < b_m \le b_n$, and any two naturals are comparable by [L6]. [step 5.1, L4, L6]

7.1 The set $S = \{\, a_n : n \in \mathbb{N} \,\}$ is nonempty and bounded above by $b_0$ by step 6.1, so [L1] gives its least upper bound $x = \sup S$, unique by [L2]. [step 5.1, step 6.1, L1, L2]

8.1 For every $n$: $a_n \le x$, because $x$ is an upper bound of $S$; and $x \le b_n$, because otherwise $\varepsilon := x - b_n > 0$ and [L3] would produce $a_m \in S$ with $b_n = x - \varepsilon < a_m$, contradicting $a_m \le b_n$ from step 6.1. Hence $x \in [a_n, b_n]$ for every $n$. [step 6.1, step 7.1, L1, L3, L4]

9.1 Taking $n = 0$ in step 8.1 gives $x \in [a_0, b_0] = [p, q]$, and $[p,q] \subseteq (a,b)$ by step 3.1, so $x \in (a,b)$. Fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$: by step 8.1 applied to $\sigma(n)$, $x \in [a_{\sigma(n)}, b_{\sigma(n)}]$, whereas $f(n) \notin [a_{\sigma(n)}, b_{\sigma(n)}]$ by step 5.1, so $x \ne f(n) = g(n)$. As $n$ was arbitrary, the element $x$ of $(a,b)$ is not a value of $g$, contradicting the surjectivity of $g$ obtained in step 4.1. So no such pair $a < b$ exists: for every $a < b$ both $[a,b]$ and $(a,b)$ fail to be at most countable, that is, both are uncountable by [L7]. [step 3.1, step 4.1, step 5.1, step 8.1, L7, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Which route this proof takes, and why.** The extension is obtained by re-running the construction of [[thm-r-uncountable]] with a new seed, not by transporting uncountability along a bijection. The reason is that there is nothing to transport: the theorem states that $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable and nothing more, and no item of this library states that $[0,1]$ is uncountable, so the affine order-isomorphism $t \mapsto a + t(b-a)$ from $[0,1]$ onto $[a,b]$ has no uncountable source to carry across. Re-running is available instead precisely because the theorem's proof is already general: its step 2.1 builds the trisection rule $T$ for an arbitrary $(a,b) \in I$, and its steps 4.1 to 7.1 quote only the nesting $a_n \le a_{\sigma(n)}$, $b_{\sigma(n)} \le b_n$, the strictness $a_n < b_n$ and the omission $f(n) \notin [a_{\sigma(n)}, b_{\sigma(n)}]$. Its step 1.1, the seed of its step 3.1 and the conclusion of its step 7.1 are the special ones, and they are the three replaced here: a surjection onto $(a,b)$ rather than onto $\mathbb{R}$, the seed $(0,(p,q))$ rather than $(0,(0,1))$, and a conclusion about the interval rather than about $\mathbb{R}$.
- **A corollary of the argument, not of the statement.** That distinction is the whole content of the previous remark, and it is why the proof is written out here in full rather than replaced by a citation. A fact of the form "for every $(a,b) \in I$ and every $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ there is $x \in [a,b]$ omitted by $f$" is true and is what the theorem's proof establishes, but it is not what the theorem says, so quoting the theorem for it would be an attribution the theorem does not support.
- **Why the seed is the middle third and not $(a,b)$ itself.** The point produced by the construction is a supremum of left endpoints, so it may be an endpoint of the starting interval; seeding at $(a,b)$ would therefore only place $x$ in the closed interval $[a,b]$, which settles claim 1 but not claim 2. Seeding at $(p,q)$, the middle third, costs nothing and gives $x \in [p,q] \subseteq (a,b)$, so the open case comes out directly and the closed case follows from it, since $(a,b) \subseteq [a,b]$ and a subset of an at most countable set is at most countable ([[lem-subset-of-countable]]). The naive order of the two claims is thus reversed: the open interval is the substantive one.
- **What the proof uses.** Exactly what [[thm-r-uncountable]] uses, and nothing else: ordered-field arithmetic, the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]), and completeness at exactly one point, step 7.1 above, where $\sup\{a_n\}$ is produced. In particular the construction still makes no choices, for the same reason as there, namely that the three closed thirds are tried in a fixed order and the first and third are disjoint. The result consequently fails for $\mathbb{Q}$, where the intervals with rational endpoints are countable, and it must, since the supremum taken in step 7.1 above need not exist there.
- **Degeneracy is the only exclusion.** The hypothesis $a < b$ cannot be weakened: $[a,a] = \{a\}$ is finite and $(a,a) = \varnothing$ is finite, so both are at most countable. Every interval that is not a single point or empty contains a nondegenerate open interval, so this corollary gives the uncountability of the half-open and unbounded intervals as well, again by [[lem-subset-of-countable]].

## Statement

In any ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, the multiplicative identity
satisfies $0 < 1$; that is, $1 \in P$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$ and multiplicative identity $1$ ([[def-field]]).

[L1] In any field $1 \neq 0$ ([[def-field]]).

[L2] For every $x \neq 0$ the square satisfies $x^2 > 0$ ([[lem-of-square-positive]]).

[L3] The identity axiom gives $1 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1^2$ ([[def-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By the field axioms $1 \neq 0$, and $1 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1^2$. [L1, L3]

2.1 Since $1 \neq 0$, applying the square lemma with $x = 1$ gives $1^2 > 0$. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 Because $1 = 1^2$, it follows that $1 > 0$, i.e. $0 < 1$. [step 2.1, step 1.1, L3] ∎

## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq F$.

- $u \in F$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$; $S$ is
  **bounded above** if it has an upper bound.
- $u \in F$ is a **least upper bound** (or **supremum**, $\sup S$) of $S$ if $u$
  is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le u'$ for every upper bound $u'$ of $S$.

$F$ is a **complete ordered field** (equivalently, $F$ has the
**least-upper-bound property**, or is **Dedekind complete**) if every nonempty
$S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$.

## Remarks

- A least upper bound, if it exists, is unique (two least upper bounds are each
  $\le$ the other, so equal by antisymmetry of the order).
- Applying the property to $\{-s : s \in S\}$ yields the dual **greatest lower
  bound** (infimum) property, so the two are equivalent.
- The Dedekind-cut reals have this property by construction
  ([[thm-dedekind-complete]]); the Cauchy-sequence reals acquire it via
  [[cor-cauchy-reals-lub-complete]]. This definition is the target for the
  uniqueness theorem [[thm-uniqueness-complete-ordered-field]].

## Definition

Recall that a natural number is a von Neumann natural
([[def-natural-numbers]]): $0 = \varnothing$ and $\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$, so
that

$$n = \{\, m \in \mathbb{N} : m < n \,\} = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$$

is itself the set of its predecessors. Here $<$ is the order of
[[def-nat-order]], which is defined additively, so the displayed identity is a
theorem and not a convention: it is [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]], proved
immediately above. Let $A$ be a set, and let $\approx$ be equinumerosity
([[def-equinumerous]]).

- $A$ is **finite** if $A \approx n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
- $A$ is **countably infinite** if $A \approx \mathbb{N}$.
- $A$ is **at most countable** if it is finite or countably infinite.
- $A$ is **uncountable** if it is not at most countable.

## Remarks

- **Convention: in this library "countable" alone always means "at most
  countable"**, so a finite set is countable. This is the convention of Halmos
  and of Tao, and it is the one that makes the theorems on this page read
  cleanly: subsets, products and unions of countable sets are countable, with no
  finite/infinite case split in the statement. The competing convention, used by
  Rudin among others, reserves "countable" for "countably infinite" and says
  "at most countable" for the disjunction. Under that convention every statement
  below still holds after replacing "countable" with "at most countable", but
  several would become false as literally written. Where the distinction
  matters, the long forms "countably infinite" and "at most countable" are used
  in full, and "uncountable" always means "not at most countable", on which the
  two conventions agree.

- **The three classes are exhaustive by construction**: every set is finite,
  countably infinite, or uncountable, since "uncountable" is defined as the
  negation of the disjunction. That they are also mutually exclusive, that is,
  that no set is both finite and countably infinite, is a genuine theorem
  amounting to $\mathbb{N} \not\approx n$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and it is
  proved immediately above as claim 4 of [[lem-pigeonhole]]. So a countably
  infinite set is never finite, and "$A$ is infinite", meaning not finite, is
  implied by $A \approx \mathbb{N}$. The same lemma pins down finiteness itself:
  by its claim 3 a finite set is equinumerous with exactly one natural number, so
  the number of elements of a finite set is well defined, and by its claim 5 no
  finite set is equinumerous with a proper subset of itself.

- **What the exclusivity is and is not used for below.** Nothing on this page
  needs it in order to run: the infinitude of $\mathbb{Q}$, for instance, is
  obtained by exhibiting a bijection $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ directly
  ([[thm-rationals-countable]]) rather than by ruling out finiteness. It is used
  where the two notions of infinity are compared
  ([[fs-infinite-has-countable-subset-in-zf]]) and where the continuum hypothesis
  is instantiated at $\mathbb{N}$ ([[rem-continuum-hypothesis]]), both of which
  need $\mathbb{N}$ to be infinite as a fact rather than as a convention.

- **$0$ and the empty set.** $0 = \varnothing$, and $A \approx 0$ holds exactly
  when $A = \varnothing$, so the empty set is finite. This matters in the proofs
  below, where the empty case is always separated out: a surjection
  $\mathbb{N} \to A$ cannot exist when $A = \varnothing$, which is why
  [[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]] assumes $A$ nonempty.

- **Countability is a property of a set alone**, not of a set with structure. In
  particular $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable while carrying a dense order, and
  $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable; neither statement says anything on its own about
  the order or the arithmetic those sets carry.

## Definition

Let $X$ be a set and let $R \subseteq X \times X$ be a binary relation on $X$.
Call $R$ **entire on $X$** when

$$\text{for every } x \in X \text{ there is } y \in X \text{ with } x \mathbin{R} y .$$

The **Axiom of Dependent Choice**, written $\mathrm{DC}$, is the following
statement.

> For every nonempty set $X$, every relation $R$ entire on $X$, and every
> $a \in X$, there is a sequence $x : \mathbb{N} \to X$ ([[def-sequence]],
> [[def-natural-numbers]]) with
> $$x_0 = a \qquad \text{and} \qquad x_n \mathbin{R} x_{n+1} \ \text{ for every } n \in \mathbb{N}.$$

As everywhere in this library $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$, and the sequence is
indexed from $0$; the term $x_0$ is the prescribed starting point $a$ and every
later term is related to its predecessor.

**What DC adds to what came before.** [[def-choice-function]] and
[[def-axiom-of-choice]] select one element from each member of a family that is
fixed in advance, and [[def-countable-choice]] does the same for a family indexed
by $\mathbb{N}$. In both, the family is given before any selection is made. DC is
the principle needed when the $n$-th set to select from is not known until the
first $n$ selections have been made: here the admissible values of $x_{n+1}$ are
exactly the $R$-successors of $x_n$, so the family being chosen from is built
along the choosing. That is precisely the situation $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ does not
cover, and it is why a construction "pick $x_{n+1}$ depending on $x_n$, for every
$n$ at once" is not licensed by countable choice.

**The starting point may be dropped.** The formally weaker statement obtained by
deleting the clause $x_0 = a$ — for every nonempty $X$ and every entire $R$ there
is a sequence with $x_n \mathbin{R} x_{n+1}$ for all $n$ — is an immediate
consequence of the form above, since $X$ is nonempty and any of its elements may
be taken as $a$. The reverse derivation is standard and is not needed anywhere in
this library, so it is not carried out; every use below prescribes $x_0$.

**$R$ need not be an order and the terms need not be distinct.** What DC delivers
is a sequence, that is a function $\mathbb{N} \to X$, not a chain in the
order-theoretic sense ([[def-chain]]). The relation may be symmetric, and the
sequence may repeat a value or be constant; all that is asserted is
$x_n \mathbin{R} x_{n+1}$ at every index.

## Remarks

**Where DC sits among the choice principles.** It is a standard fact, proved in
the references and **not** in this library, that

$$\mathrm{AC} \;\Longrightarrow\; \mathrm{DC} \;\Longrightarrow\; \mathrm{AC}_\omega ,$$

and that neither implication reverses. The non-reversals are relative-consistency
results: what they establish is that ZF, if consistent, does not prove the
missing implications, never that those implications are false. This library
contains neither forcing nor permutation models and proves no independence
result, so all of that is quoted from the references and used nowhere.

**Nothing in this library proves DC, and nothing assumes it silently.** Like
[[def-axiom-of-choice]] and [[def-countable-choice]], DC is a statement that may
be assumed or not. Every theorem whose proof uses it says so in its own
statement, and the accounting for the compactness page is collected in
[[rem-compactness-choice-ledger-metric]].

**An upper bound, never a lower one.** When a later item records that its proof
uses DC, the claim made is that the argument given here is carried out in
$\mathrm{ZF} + \mathrm{DC}$. No item claims that DC is *necessary* for the
statement proved, because establishing necessity means separating the statement
from ZF, and that is an independence result of exactly the kind this library does
not prove.

## Definition

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]] for the
terminology).

- $A$ and $B$ are **equinumerous**, written $A \approx B$, if there exists a
  bijection $f : A \to B$.
- $A$ is **dominated by** $B$, written $A \preceq B$, if there exists an
  injection $f : A \to B$.
- $A \prec B$ abbreviates: $A \preceq B$ and not $A \approx B$.

## Remarks

- **$\approx$ behaves like an equivalence relation.** It is reflexive
  ($\mathrm{id}_A$ is a bijection), symmetric (the inverse of a bijection is a
  bijection) and transitive (a composition of bijections is a bijection). The
  careful statement is that these three properties hold for all sets, and that
  $\approx$ restricted to any *set* of sets is an equivalence relation on that
  set. It is not a relation on "the set of all sets", which does not exist; the
  reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity statements are schemas about arbitrary
  sets, which is all any argument below uses.

- **$\preceq$ is reflexive and transitive**, for the same reasons, and
  $A \approx B$ implies both $A \preceq B$ and $B \preceq A$. The converse, that
  $A \preceq B$ and $B \preceq A$ together give $A \approx B$, is a theorem and
  not a triviality: it is [[thm-schroder-bernstein]], and it is proved without
  any use of choice.

- **Subsets.** $A \subseteq B$ implies $A \preceq B$, since the inclusion map is
  injective. The reverse fails badly for infinite sets: the successor map
  $\sigma$ is a bijection $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, being
  injective and never zero ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]) and hitting every
  nonzero natural ([[lem-nat-nonzero-is-successor]]), so
  $\mathbb{N} \approx \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$ and a proper subset can be
  equinumerous with the whole.

- $\approx$ is the library's substitute for "has the same number of elements",
  stated without introducing cardinal numbers. Everything on this page is phrased
  with $\approx$, $\preceq$ and $\prec$ alone, so no theory of cardinals is
  presupposed.

## Definition

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets and let $f : A \to B$ be a function ([[def-function]]).

- $f$ is **injective** (one-to-one) if $f(x) = f(y)$ implies $x = y$, for all
  $x, y \in A$.
- $f$ is **surjective** (onto) if for every $b \in B$ there is some $x \in A$
  with $f(x) = b$; equivalently, the image $f[A] := \{ f(x) : x \in A \}$ equals
  $B$.
- $f$ is **bijective** if it is both injective and surjective.

For $S \subseteq A$ we write $f[S] = \{ f(x) : x \in S \}$ for the image of $S$,
and for $T \subseteq B$ we write $f^{-1}[T] = \{ x \in A : f(x) \in T \}$ for the
preimage of $T$; these are the image and preimage of a set under $f$ read as a
relation ([[def-image-and-preimage-under-a-relation]]).

## Remarks

- **Composition.** If $f : A \to B$ and $g : B \to C$ are both injective then so
  is $g \circ f$, since $g(f(x)) = g(f(y))$ forces $f(x) = f(y)$ and then
  $x = y$; if both are surjective then so is $g \circ f$, since any $c \in C$ is
  $g(b)$ for some $b \in B$ and that $b$ is $f(a)$ for some $a \in A$. Hence a
  composition of bijections is a bijection. These verifications, together with the
  two partial converses, are
  [[prop-composition-preserves-injectivity-surjectivity-and-bijectivity]].

- **Inverses.** $f : A \to B$ is bijective exactly when there is a function
  $f^{-1} : B \to A$ with $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ for all $x \in A$ and
  $f(f^{-1}(b)) = b$ for all $b \in B$; that two-sided inverse is unique, and it
  is itself a bijection. Injectivity alone gives a bijection from $A$ onto the
  image $f[A]$, and hence an inverse defined on $f[A]$ only. No choice principle
  is involved: the value $f^{-1}(b)$ is the *unique* $x$ with $f(x) = b$, so it
  is determined rather than selected. The full statement, with the uniqueness of the
  two-sided inverse, is
  [[thm-a-function-is-a-bijection-exactly-when-it-has-a-two-sided-inverse]]; the
  corresponding statement for an arbitrary surjection is not available at this point
  in the reading order, because a right inverse for every surjection is equivalent
  to the Axiom of Choice.

- **What this item does and does not do.** A function $A \to B$ is a set of ordered
  pairs, single valued and total on $A$ ([[def-function]]); ordered pairs, Cartesian
  products, images and preimages are fixed by [[def-ordered-pair]],
  [[def-cartesian-product]] and [[def-image-and-preimage-under-a-relation]]. This
  item only fixes the three adjectives and the notation used for them. Nothing here
  is proved.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]] and closure as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]].

- $x$ is an **adherent point** of $A$ when $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne
  \varnothing$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$.
- $x$ is a **limit point** (or *accumulation point*) of $A$ when
  $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every real
  $\varepsilon > 0$: every punctured neighbourhood of $x$ meets $A$.
- $x$ is an **isolated point** of $A$ when $x \in A$ and there is a real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$.
- The **derived set** of $A$ is
  $$A' \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \text{ is a limit point of } A \,\}.$$
- $A$ is **dense in $\mathbb{R}$** when $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$.

**A limit point is an adherent point**, since $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq
N_\varepsilon(x)$; and an element of $A$ is an adherent point of $A$, since
$x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). So the adherent
points of $A$ are exactly the points of $A \cup A'$, a statement proved as part
of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

**Limit point and isolated point are exact opposites inside $A$.** For
$x \in A$: $x$ is an isolated point of $A$ exactly when it is not a limit point
of $A$. Indeed $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$ says precisely that
$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, because $x$ itself always lies in
$N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ when $x \in A$; so the existence of an $\varepsilon$
witnessing isolation is the negation of the condition defining a limit point.
A point of $A$ is therefore either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$, and
never both.

**A limit point need not belong to the set, and a point of the set need not be a
limit point.** Both possibilities occur, and the two examples that matter later
are $0$, which is a limit point of $\{\, 1/k : k \ge 1 \,\}$ without belonging
to it, and $0$ again, which belongs to $\{0\} \cup [1,2]$ as an isolated point.

## Remarks

- **Terminology: *limit point* here is about a set, never about a sequence.**
  This library reserves *subsequential limit* for the sequential notion
  ([[def-subsequential-limit]]), and the two are genuinely different: the
  constant sequence $x_k = 0$ has $0$ as a subsequential limit, while its set of
  values $\{0\}$ has no limit point at all. The distinction is the one
  [[def-subsequential-limit]] records under "Terminology", and it is respected
  throughout this page.

- **Density is defined through the closure, not through intervals.** Saying
  $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$ is equivalent to saying that every nonempty open
  subset of $\mathbb{R}$ meets $A$, and also to saying that every neighbourhood
  of every real meets $A$; the equivalences follow from
  [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] and are used in that form in
  [[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]].

- **The derived set need not be comparable with the set.** It can be strictly
  larger, as for $\mathbb{Q}$: every punctured neighbourhood of any real
  contains a rational, since density supplies one strictly between $x$ and
  $x + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]), so the derived set of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is all of $\mathbb{R}$. It can be strictly smaller, as for
  $\{0\}$, whose derived set is empty; and it can be neither, as for
  $\{0\} \cup (1,2)$, whose derived set is $[1,2]$, a set containing points
  outside the original and omitting the point $0$ of it. A closed set satisfying
  $A \subseteq A'$ is called perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]).

## Definition

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $m \in \mathbb{R}$.

- $m$ is a **maximum** (or *greatest element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $s \le m$
  for every $s \in S$.
- $m$ is a **minimum** (or *least element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $m \le s$
  for every $s \in S$.

A set has at most one maximum: if $m_1$ and $m_2$ are both maxima then
$m_1 \in S$ gives $m_1 \le m_2$ and $m_2 \in S$ gives $m_2 \le m_1$, so
$m_1 = m_2$ by antisymmetry of the order, which is immediate from the trichotomy
axiom of an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).
The same argument applies to minima, so we may write $\max S$ and $\min S$.

## Remarks

- A maximum is precisely an upper bound of $S$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]])
  that happens to lie in $S$; a minimum is a lower bound of $S$
  ([[def-bounded-set]]) that lies in $S$. In particular a set with a maximum is
  bounded above and a set with a minimum is bounded below.
- The empty set has neither a maximum nor a minimum, because the requirement
  $m \in S$ cannot be met.
- The membership requirement $m \in S$ is exactly what separates a maximum from a
  supremum, and it is the theme of this page. A supremum is a bound on the set
  and is not asked to belong to it; a maximum is an element of the set. The two
  agree exactly when the supremum happens to be attained ([[lem-max-is-sup]]),
  and they genuinely differ in general ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has both a maximum and a minimum
  ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]), which is what licenses the notation
  $\max\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$. Infinite sets need not: the failure of attainment is
  an infinitary phenomenon.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]) and its absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]).

Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ with
$\varepsilon > 0$. The **$\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\},$$

and the **punctured $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \;=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}.$$

The two descriptions of $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ agree because $|y - x| = 0$ holds
exactly when $y = x$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**A neighbourhood is an open interval.** For every $x$ and every
$\varepsilon > 0$,

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;=\; (x - \varepsilon,\ x + \varepsilon),$$

the interval of [[def-interval]]. Indeed [[lem-of-abs-value]] gives, for
$\varepsilon > 0$, the equivalence $|y - x| < \varepsilon \iff -\varepsilon <
y - x < \varepsilon$, and adding $x$ throughout turns the right-hand side into
$x - \varepsilon < y < x + \varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**The centre lies in its own neighbourhoods.** $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, since
$|x - x| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**Punctured neighbourhoods are never empty.** The element
$y := x + \varepsilon/2$ satisfies $|y - x| = \varepsilon/2$, which is
$> 0$ and $< \varepsilon$, so $y \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$
([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

**Monotonicity in the radius.** If $0 < \delta \le \varepsilon$ then
$N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, because $|y - x| < \delta \le
\varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**Nesting at an interior point.** If $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and
$0 < \delta \le \varepsilon - |y - x|$, then

$$N_\delta(y) \;\subseteq\; N_\varepsilon(x).$$

Indeed for $z \in N_\delta(y)$ the triangle inequality
([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]) gives
$|z - x| = |(z - y) + (y - x)| \le |z - y| + |y - x| < \delta + |y - x| \le
\varepsilon$. Note that $\varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ precisely because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, so such a $\delta$ always exists.

## Remarks

- **The radius is a real number, not a rational.** Nothing on this page tests a
  condition against rational radii only. That convention belongs to
  [[def-real-limit]], where the quantifier is over rational $\varepsilon$ and
  the passage between the rational and the real form is the sanctioned remark of
  [[def-sequence]]. Here $\varepsilon$ ranges over the positive reals
  throughout, and every statement above is proved for an arbitrary positive
  real.

- **Why the punctured version is separated out.** A limit point of a set is a
  point every punctured neighbourhood of which meets the set
  ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and deleting the centre is exactly what stops a point
  of the set from qualifying automatically. The unpunctured condition defines
  the weaker notion of an adherent point, and the difference between the two is
  precisely an isolated point.

- **Nesting is the workhorse.** Almost every openness verification on this page
  has the shape "given $y$ in the set, shrink the radius by the distance
  already travelled", which is the nesting property above. It is recorded here
  once so that no later proof has to redo the triangle inequality in passing.

## Definition

Let $U, F \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]].

- $U$ is **open** when for every $x \in U$ there is a real $\varepsilon > 0$
  with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$.
- $F$ is **closed** when its complement $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open.
- A set is **clopen** when it is both open and closed.

The whole of the topology of $\mathbb{R}$ developed on this page rests on this
one definition: closedness is *defined* as openness of the complement, and every
other description of a closed set on this page is a theorem
([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]]).

**$\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen.** The condition defining openness
quantifies over the elements of the set, so it holds vacuously for
$\varnothing$; and for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ one has $N_1(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$,
so $\mathbb{R}$ is open. Since each of the two is the complement of the other,
each is also closed.

**Every neighbourhood is open.** Let $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and put
$\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x|$, which is $> 0$ because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$. The nesting property of [[def-neighbourhood-r]] gives
$N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$. So every point of $N_\varepsilon(x)$
has a neighbourhood inside it.

**The four open forms of [[def-interval]] are open sets.** Let $a, b \in
\mathbb{R}$.

- $(a,b)$: for $x$ with $a < x < b$, both $x - a > 0$ and $b - x > 0$, so
  $\delta := \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ is a positive real (the minimum of a
  two-element set of reals exists, [[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).
  If $|y - x| < \delta$ then $y > x - \delta \ge x - (x - a) = a$ and
  $y < x + \delta \le x + (b - x) = b$, so $y \in (a,b)$; hence
  $N_\delta(x) \subseteq (a,b)$.
- $(a,\infty)$: for $x > a$ take $\delta := x - a > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y > x - \delta = a$.
- $(-\infty,b)$: for $x < b$ take $\delta := b - x > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y < x + \delta = b$.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: already treated above.

**The four closed forms of [[def-interval]] are closed sets.** In each case the
complement is shown open directly.

- $[a,b]$: if $x \notin [a,b]$ then $x < a$ or $x > b$ by trichotomy
  ([[def-ordered-field]]). If $x < a$, take $\delta := a - x > 0$; every
  $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has $y < x + \delta = a$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. If
  $x > b$, take $\delta := x - b > 0$; every $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has
  $y > x - \delta = b$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. So
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus [a,b]$ is open.
- $[a,\infty)$: its complement is $(-\infty,a)$, which is open by the previous
  paragraph.
- $(-\infty,b]$: its complement is $(b,\infty)$, which is open.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: its complement is $\varnothing$, which is
  open.

## Remarks

- **Open and closed are not opposites, and not exhaustive.** A set may be
  neither: the half-open interval $[0,1)$ is neither open nor closed
  ([[fs-every-set-is-open-or-closed]]). A set may be both: $\varnothing$ and
  $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen. The words are inherited from the interval terminology
  of [[def-interval]], and the agreement between the two usages is exactly the
  two lists verified above: an interval called open there is an open set here,
  and an interval called closed there is a closed set here.

- **A clopen set is a disconnection waiting to happen.** If $A$ is clopen and
  both $A$ and $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ are nonempty, then each of the two is
  its own closure, so the two are separated in the sense of
  [[def-connected-r]] and $\mathbb{R} = A \cup (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)$ is a
  disconnection. Since $\mathbb{R}$ is order-convex it is connected
  ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]]), so no such $A$ exists:
  $\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are the only clopen subsets of $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The half-open forms are the ones the two lists omit**, and deliberately so:
  $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ with $a < b$ are neither open nor closed as subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The radius depends on the point.** Openness asks for *some* $\varepsilon$
  at each point, and that $\varepsilon$ may shrink to nothing as the point
  approaches the edge of the set, as the computation for $(a,b)$ shows: there
  $\delta = \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ tends to $0$ as $x$ tends to either endpoint.
  Asking instead for a single $\varepsilon$ that works simultaneously at every
  point of the set is a strictly stronger condition, and it is not what is
  defined here; nothing on this page uses it.

## Definition

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ ([[def-field]]) together with a subset
$P \subseteq F$, the set of **positive** elements (the *positive cone*),
satisfying:

- **(O1) Trichotomy.** For each $x \in F$, exactly one of the following holds:
  $x \in P$, or $x = 0$, or $-x \in P$.
- **(O2) Closure.** If $x, y \in P$ then $x + y \in P$ and $x \cdot y \in P$.

We write $x > 0$ for $x \in P$ (read "$x$ is positive"), and define the order by

$$a < b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; b - a \in P, \qquad a \le b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; a < b \text{ or } a = b.$$

Thus $a > b$ means $b < a$, and $a \ge b$ means $b \le a$. An element $x$ with
$-x \in P$ (equivalently $x < 0$) is called **negative**.

## Remarks

- By trichotomy applied to $b - a$, for any $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$,
  $a = b$, $a > b$ holds; this makes $\le$ a total order.
- (O2) says the positives are closed under addition and multiplication: sums and
  products of positives are positive.
- The rationals ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and both constructions of the reals
  ([[thm-reals-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-dedekind-ordered-field]]) are ordered
  fields, so every fact proved here from (O1)-(O2) holds in each of them.

## Definition

A set $P \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **perfect** when

- $P$ is closed ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), and
- $P$ has no isolated points ([[def-limit-point-r]]): no $x \in P$ admits a real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap P = \{x\}$.

**Equivalently, $P$ is closed and $P \subseteq P'$.** By
[[def-limit-point-r]], a point of $P$ is isolated in $P$ exactly when it is not
a limit point of $P$, so "no point of $P$ is isolated in $P$" says precisely
that every point of $P$ is a limit point of $P$, that is, $P \subseteq P'$.
Combined with the characterisation of closedness as $P' \subseteq P$
([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]]), a perfect set is exactly a set with
$P = P'$, though only the two conditions above are used below.

## Remarks

- **Both conditions are needed and neither implies the other.** The set
  $\{0\} \cup [1,2]$ is closed and has the isolated point $0$, so it is not
  perfect ([[cex-closed-set-with-an-isolated-point-is-not-perfect]]); the open
  interval $(0,1)$ has no isolated points and is not closed, so it is not
  perfect either.

- **$\varnothing$ is perfect**, vacuously: it is closed and has no points at
  all, hence no isolated ones. This is why
  [[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]] carries the hypothesis that $P$ is nonempty:
  the empty set is perfect and countable.

- **A nonempty perfect set is forced to be large.** It is uncountable
  ([[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]]), and the simplest examples are the
  nondegenerate closed intervals ([[ex-closed-interval-is-perfect]]). A perfect
  set need not contain any interval, the Cantor set being the standard example
  of that; it is not constructed anywhere in this library, and the statement is
  recorded here as orientation only, on the references above.

every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with
$|x_k - x| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$. It is **Cauchy** when for

$|x_k - x_l| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$.

## Remarks

- Quantifying over rational $\varepsilon$ loses nothing: below any real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ lies a positive rational ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).
- $|\cdot|$ is the absolute value of [[def-real-order]].

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]],
[[def-real-numbers]]) with its order and absolute value ([[def-real-order]]), and
$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers with its order ([[def-natural-numbers]],
[[def-nat-order]]).

A **sequence of reals** is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$. We write
$x_k$ for the value $x(k)$, call it the **$k$-th term**, and write $(x_k)$, or
$(x_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$, for the function itself. The **range** of $(x_k)$ is
the subset $\{\, x_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals and let $P$ be a property of indices.

- $(x_k)$ is **bounded** if there is $M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for
  every $k \in \mathbb{N}$; it is **unbounded** otherwise.
- $P$ holds **eventually** if there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $P(k)$ holds
  for every $k \ge K$.
- $P$ holds **frequently** if for every $K \in \mathbb{N}$ there is some
  $k \ge K$ for which $P(k)$ holds.
- For $K \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$K$-th tail** of $(x_k)$ is the sequence
  $x^{(K)}$ defined by $x^{(K)}_j := x_{j + K}$ for $j \in \mathbb{N}$; it is
  again a sequence of reals.
- A function $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is **strictly increasing** if
  $n_j < n_k$ whenever $j < k$. For such an $n$, the **subsequence** of $(x_k)$
  along $n$ is the composite $x \circ n$, written $(x_{n_k})_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$;
  it is again a sequence of reals.

**Convergence and Cauchyness are not defined here.** They are already fixed, for
sequences of reals, by the published [[def-real-limit]]: $(x_k)$ *converges* to
$x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is
$K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$, and $(x_k)$
is *Cauchy* when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$
with $|x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$. This page builds the
toolkit for those two notions and does not restate them. A sequence
**converges** if it converges to some real, and **diverges** if it does not.

## Remarks

- **Identification of $\mathbb{Q}$ with its image.** The map $q \mapsto \hat q$
  is an embedding of ordered fields ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and as is
  standard we write $q$ for $\hat q$, so that a rational may be compared with a
  real without further comment. [[def-real-limit]] is stated with the hat; every
  rational $\varepsilon$ occurring on this page is its image under this
  embedding.

- **Rational and real $\varepsilon$ agree.** [[def-real-limit]] tests convergence
  against every *rational* $\varepsilon > 0$, and its own remark records that
  this loses nothing. Spelled out: suppose that for every rational
  $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all
  $k \ge K$, and let $\eta > 0$ be an arbitrary *real*. Since $0 < \eta$,
  density of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) supplies a
  rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, and the index $K$
  belonging to that $\varepsilon$ satisfies $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon < \eta$ for
  all $k \ge K$. The converse implication is immediate, since every positive
  rational is a positive real. So the two formulations define the same relation,
  and the same two lines apply verbatim to the Cauchy condition and to any
  condition of the shape "for every $\varepsilon > 0$, eventually
  $\cdots < \varepsilon$". Proofs on this page therefore run the test with a real
  $\varepsilon$ wherever that is more convenient, and say so by citing this
  remark; nothing is smuggled in.

- **Constant sequences converge.** For $c \in \mathbb{R}$ the constant sequence
  $x_k := c$ converges to $c$, because $|x_k - c| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ for
  every $\varepsilon > 0$ and every $k$; it is bounded by $|c|$.

- **Eventually and frequently are dual.** $P$ holds frequently exactly when
  $\lnot P$ does not hold eventually, and $P$ holds eventually exactly when
  $\lnot P$ does not hold frequently. So the two quantifier patterns are
  negations of one another applied to the complementary property, and there is no
  third pattern hiding between them.

- **A sequence is not its range.** $(x_k)$ is a function, not a set, and the
  range does not determine the function: the sequence $x_0 = 0$, $x_k = 1$ for
  $k \ge 1$ and the sequence $y_0 = y_1 = 0$, $y_k = 1$ for $k \ge 2$ have the
  same range $\{0, 1\}$, yet they differ at $k = 1$, so they are different
  sequences. Order and repetition are part of the data and the range forgets
  both. Boundedness, on the other hand, depends only on the range.

- **Indexing.** Sequences here start at $k = 0$ because $\mathbb{N}$ contains
  $0$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]). Texts that index from $1$ describe the same
  objects up to a shift, and the shift changes nothing about convergence, by
  [[lem-limit-of-tail]].

## Example

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$. Then the closed interval
$E := [a,b]$ ([[def-interval]]) is perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]), and
therefore uncountable by [[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]].

This is a second proof of the uncountability of a nondegenerate interval. The
first, [[cor-interval-uncountable]], runs a trisection argument directly against
an assumed enumeration; the route here checks two purely local properties,
closedness and the absence of isolated points, and lets the perfect-set theorem
do the counting.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and the interval $E := [a,b] = \{\, x : a \le x \le b \,\}$.

[L1] A set is perfect when it is closed and no point of it is isolated in it; $x \in P$ is isolated in $P$ when some $N_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $P$ only in $x$ ([[def-perfect-set-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L2] Each interval of the form $[a,b]$ is a closed set ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L3] $N_\varepsilon(x) = \{\, y : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L4] Every nonempty perfect subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable ([[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]]).

[L5] For $a < b$ the intervals $[a,b]$ and $(a,b)$ are uncountable ([[cor-interval-uncountable]]).

[L6] Every nonempty finite set of reals has a minimum, which is one of its members ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L7] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 := 1+1 > 0$ and $0 < d \cdot 2^{-1} < d$ for $d > 0$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve inequalities; the order is total and transitive ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Verification

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $E$ is closed by [L2], and nonempty since $a \in E$. [L2]

1.2 No point of $E$ is isolated in $E$: let $x \in E$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real. If $x < b$, put $t := \min\{\varepsilon,\ b - x\} \cdot 2^{-1}$, which is positive by [L6] and [L7], and $y := x + t$; then $y > x$, and $y \le x + (b-x) \cdot 2^{-1} < b$ by [L7], while $y > x \ge a$, so $y \in E$ with $y \ne x$ and $|y - x| = t \le \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} < \varepsilon$. If $x = b$, then $x > a$; put $t := \min\{\varepsilon,\ b - a\} \cdot 2^{-1} > 0$ and $y := x - t$; then $y < x \le b$, and $y \ge b - (b-a) \cdot 2^{-1} > a$ by [L7], so $y \in E$ with $y \ne x$ and $|y - x| = t < \varepsilon$. In both cases $N_\varepsilon(x)$ contains a point of $E$ other than $x$, so no $\varepsilon$ isolates $x$. [L1, L3, L6, L7]

2.1 By steps 1.1 and 1.2 the set $E$ is closed with no isolated points, that is, perfect, and it is nonempty. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1]

3.1 By [L4] the nonempty perfect set $E$ is uncountable, which reproves for $[a,b]$ the first claim of [L5] along an independent route. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L4, L5] ∎

## Remarks

- **Nondegeneracy is exactly what is needed.** For $a = b$ the set $[a,a] =
  \{a\}$ is closed, its single point is isolated, and it is finite; the argument
  of step 1.2 breaks precisely there, since neither $x < b$ nor $x > a$ holds.
  This matches the hypothesis $a < b$ of [[cor-interval-uncountable]].

- **The open interval supplies only half of the definition.** The computation of
  step 1.2 applies verbatim inside $(a,b)$ and shows it has no isolated points,
  but $(a,b)$ is not closed, so it is not perfect. Perfectness needs both halves,
  which is why the example is stated for the closed interval.

- **Two proofs of one fact, sharing one ingredient.** Both routes spend the
  completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ exactly once, [[cor-interval-uncountable]] as a
  supremum and [[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]] through
  [[thm-nested-interval-property]]. They differ in everything else: the first
  trisects a given interval against a given enumeration, the second selects
  rational-endpoint intervals by least index. Neither is a corollary of the
  other.

## Example

Put

$$B \;:=\; \{\, 1/k : k \in \mathbb{N},\ k \ge 1 \,\} \qquad \text{and} \qquad A \;:=\; B \cup \{0\} .$$

The index runs over $k \ge 1$ because $1/0$ is undefined. Then $A$ is compact
([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]]) and $B$ is not closed
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]). The single point $0$ is the whole difference:
it is a limit point of $B$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]) that $B$ omits, and adjoining
it turns a non-closed bounded set into a compact one.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The sets $B := \{\, 1/k : k \ge 1 \,\}$ and $A := B \cup \{0\}$, where $1/k$ denotes the inverse of the canonical natural $k \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$, defined and positive for $k \ge 1$.

[L1] A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is compact exactly when it is closed and bounded ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L2] A set is closed exactly when it contains all its limit points; a point is a limit point of $S$ when every punctured neighbourhood of it meets $S$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L3] $U$ is open when each of its points has a neighbourhood inside it, and $S$ is closed when $\mathbb{R} \setminus S$ is open; $N_\varepsilon(x) = \{\, y : |y-x| < \varepsilon \,\}$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L4] Reciprocal Archimedean property: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]]).

[L5] Canonical naturals are positive and increasing for $k \ge 1$, with $1 \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} = 1$; reciprocation of positives is positive and reverses the order, so $1 \le m \le n$ gives $0 < 1/n \le 1/m \le 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

[L6] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L7] Every nonempty finite set of reals has a minimum, which is one of its members ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L8] Absolute value: $|z| = z$ for $z \ge 0$ and $|z| = -z$ for $z < 0$; the order is total and transitive ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Verification

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Every element of $A$ lies in $[0,1]$, and $0$ and $1$ belong to $A$: indeed $1 = 1/1 \in B$, and $0 < 1/k \le 1$ for every $k \ge 1$ by [L5]. In particular $A$ is bounded. [L1, L5]

1.2 $0$ is a limit point of $B$ and $0 \notin B$: given a real $\varepsilon > 0$, [L4] supplies $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$, and $1/n \in B$ with $1/n \ne 0$, so $1/n$ lies in the punctured neighbourhood of $0$ of radius $\varepsilon$ and meets $B$; and $0 \notin B$ because every $1/k$ is positive by [L5]. [L2, L4, L5]

2.1 Let $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus A$ with $x < 0$ or $x > 1$. Put $\varepsilon := -x$ in the first case and $\varepsilon := x - 1$ in the second; then $\varepsilon > 0$, and $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ gives $y < x + \varepsilon = 0$ in the first case and $y > x - \varepsilon = 1$ in the second, so $y \notin A$ by step 1.1. Hence $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$. [step 1.1, L3, L8]

2.2 Let $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus A$ with $0 \le x \le 1$. Then $x \ne 0$ and $x \ne 1$ by step 1.1, so $0 < x < 1$. The set $\{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : k \ge 1 \text{ and } 1/k < x \,\}$ is nonempty by [L4], so it has a least element $k_0$ by [L6], and $k_0 \ne 1$ since $1/1 = 1 > x$; hence $k_0 \ge 2$ and $k_0 - 1 \ge 1$. By minimality $1/(k_0-1) < x$ fails, so $x \le 1/(k_0-1)$, and $x \ne 1/(k_0-1)$ because $x \notin A$, so $x < 1/(k_0-1)$. Put $\varepsilon := \min\{\, x - 1/k_0,\ 1/(k_0-1) - x \,\} > 0$ by [L7]. Then $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$: an element of $A$ is $0$ or $1/m$ with $m \ge 1$; for $0$ one has $|0 - x| = x > \varepsilon$ since $\varepsilon \le x - 1/k_0 < x$; for $m \ge k_0$ one has $1/m \le 1/k_0 \le x - \varepsilon$ by [L5]; and for $1 \le m \le k_0 - 1$ one has $1/m \ge 1/(k_0-1) \ge x + \varepsilon$ by [L5]. In each case the element is at distance at least $\varepsilon$ from $x$. [step 1.1, L3, L4, L5, L6, L7, L8]

2.3 $B$ is not closed: by step 1.2 the point $0$ is a limit point of $B$ that does not lie in $B$, so $B$ does not contain all its limit points and [L2] denies that it is closed. [step 1.2, L2]

3.1 $A$ is closed: every $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus A$ falls under step 2.1 or step 2.2 by totality of the order, and in either case some $N_\varepsilon(x)$ misses $A$, so $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ is open. With the boundedness of step 1.1 and [L1], $A$ is compact. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, L1, L3, L8]

4.1 So $A = \{\, 1/k : k \ge 1 \,\} \cup \{0\}$ is compact by step 3.1 while $B = \{\, 1/k : k \ge 1 \,\}$ is not closed by step 2.3, hence not compact by [L1]. [step 2.3, step 3.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **$B$ is bounded and not compact, and it fails to be closed by a single
  point.** Adjoining $0$ is what the verification above shows to be enough:
  $A = B \cup \{0\}$ is closed. The same computation, run at a point $x \notin A$
  lying between two consecutive reciprocals, is the one that isolates each
  $1/k$ from the rest of $B$.

- **$A$ is compact and has an isolated point.** Every $1/k$ is isolated in $A$,
  so $A$ is not perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]); compactness and perfectness are
  independent properties, and this is a compact set that is countable, which is
  possible exactly because it is not perfect
  ([[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]]).

- **The index range matters.** The set is indexed from $k = 1$; $1/0$ does not
  exist. Since $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$ ([[def-sequence]]), a set written
  $\{1/k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$ without a restriction would be ill formed, and the
  same care is needed at the threshold $K = n-1$ used in the convergence
  arguments on the parent page.

## Statement

Let $A$ be a nonempty set. Then $A$ is at most countable ([[def-countable]]) if
and only if there is a surjection $s : \mathbb{N} \to A$
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

Moreover, from any such surjection an injection $A \to \mathbb{N}$ is obtained
explicitly, without any choice, by

$$j(a) := \min\{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : s(k) = a \,\}.$$

This is the working form of countability used everywhere below: to prove a
nonempty set countable it suffices to list its elements, repetitions and all.

**No choice principle is used.** The backward direction is where an appeal to
choice would be natural ("for each $a$ pick some $k$ with $s(k) = a$") and it is
avoided outright, because $\min$ is canonical: every nonempty set of naturals has
a *least* element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]), so $j(a)$ is determined by
$a$ and $s$ alone.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A nonempty set $A$. For $a \in A$ and a function $s : \mathbb{N} \to A$ write $s^{-1}(\{a\}) = \{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : s(k) = a \,\}$.

[L1] $A$ is at most countable when $A \approx n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ or $A \approx \mathbb{N}$; $A \approx 0 = \varnothing$ holds only for $A = \varnothing$ ([[def-countable]], [[def-natural-numbers]]).

[L2] Bijections, injections, surjections, images and the symmetry and transitivity of $\approx$; an injection is a bijection onto its image ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]], [[def-equinumerous]]).

[L3] Well-ordering: every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L4] Every subset of an at most countable set is at most countable ([[lem-subset-of-countable]]).

[L5] For naturals, $k \in n \iff k < n$, so a natural number $n$ is the set $\{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : k < n \,\}$ of naturals below it; in particular $0 \in n$ whenever $n \ne 0$ ([[lem-nat-order-is-membership]], proved earlier on this page from the additive order of [[def-nat-order]] on the von Neumann naturals of [[def-natural-numbers]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For the forward implication assume $A$ is at most countable; since $A \ne \varnothing$ we have $A \approx \mathbb{N}$, or $A \approx n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ne 0$, and in either case fix a bijection $\psi$ from $\mathbb{N}$, respectively from $n$, onto $A$. [assume-hyp, given, L1, L2]

1.2 For the converse implication assume a surjection $s : \mathbb{N} \to A$ is given. [assume-hyp]

2.1 If $\psi$ is defined on $\mathbb{N}$ it is itself a surjection $\mathbb{N} \to A$; if $\psi$ is defined on $n \ne 0$, then $0 \in n$ by [L5] and the function $s_\psi : \mathbb{N} \to A$ with $s_\psi(k) = \psi(k)$ for $k < n$ and $s_\psi(k) = \psi(0)$ for $k \ge n$ is a surjection, since every element of $A$ is $\psi(k)$ for some $k \in n$. In both cases a surjection $\mathbb{N} \to A$ exists. [step 1.1, L2, L5, construct]

2.2 For each $a \in A$ the set $s^{-1}(\{a\})$ is a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$, because $s$ is surjective, so [L3] provides its least element and $j(a) := \min s^{-1}(\{a\})$ defines a function $j : A \to \mathbb{N}$; no selection is made, since the least element is uniquely determined. [step 1.2, L3, construct]

3.1 $j$ is injective: if $j(a) = j(a') = k$ then $s(k) = a$ and $s(k) = a'$, because $j(a) \in s^{-1}(\{a\})$ and $j(a') \in s^{-1}(\{a'\})$, so $a = a'$. [step 2.2, L2]

4.1 Hence $j$ is a bijection of $A$ onto $j[A] \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, so $A \approx j[A]$; the subset $j[A]$ of the at most countable set $\mathbb{N}$ is at most countable by [L4], and transitivity of $\approx$ transfers this to $A$. [step 3.1, L1, L2, L4]

5.1 The forward implication is step 2.1 and the converse is step 4.1, so for nonempty $A$ countability and the existence of a surjection $\mathbb{N} \to A$ are equivalent, with $j$ of step 2.2 the promised injection $A \to \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, step 4.1] ∎

## Remarks

- The hypothesis $A \ne \varnothing$ cannot be dropped in the forward direction: $\varnothing$ is finite, hence at most countable, but no function $\mathbb{N} \to \varnothing$ exists at all. The converse direction needs no such hypothesis, since a surjection onto $A$ already forces $A \ne \varnothing$.

- Combining the two directions: a nonempty $A$ is at most countable if and only if $A \preceq \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-equinumerous]]). The forward direction of that reformulation is immediate, and the backward direction is step 4.1.

- The lemma is what licenses the informal phrase "enumerate $A$ as $a_0, a_1, a_2, \dots$, possibly with repetitions". Repetitions are exactly what distinguishes a surjection from a bijection, and allowing them is what makes the criterion easy to apply: the enumerations built in [[thm-product-of-countable]] and [[thm-countable-union-of-countable]] repeat.

## Statement

For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and all $a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n \in \mathbb{R}$, the
set $\{a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ has a maximum and a minimum ([[def-max-min]]).

What is proved below is exactly the displayed statement, by induction on $n$.

The usual reading, that *every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has a
maximum and a minimum*, follows once one identifies the nonempty finite subsets
of $\mathbb{R}$ with the sets listable as $\{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$. That
identification is recorded as a stipulation in the Given below, because this page
has no definition of finiteness to prove it against. **It is discharged, not
merely assumed**: [[lem-finite-subsets-listable]] proves that the two
descriptions of a nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ agree. That lemma is
recorded in `justified_by` rather than in `deps`, since it is about the sets this
lemma quantifies over and therefore depends on this one. This is what licenses
the notation
$\max\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ and $\min\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ for finite sets of
**real** numbers from this page onwards.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Real numbers $a_0, a_1, a_2, \dots$; for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write $F_n := \{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$, so that $F_{n+1} = F_n \cup \{a_{n+1}\}$. A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and finite exactly when it equals $F_n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and some choice of $a_0, \dots, a_n$.

[A1] $P(n)$ denotes the statement: for all $a_0, \dots, a_n \in \mathbb{R}$, the set $F_n$ has a maximum and a minimum.

[L1] Maximum and minimum: $m = \max X$ means $m \in X$ and $x \le m$ for all $x \in X$; $m = \min X$ means $m \in X$ and $m \le x$ for all $x \in X$; each is unique when it exists ([[def-max-min]]).

[L2] Induction principle: if $P(0)$ holds and $P(n)$ implies $P(n+1)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $P(n)$ holds for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, where $n + 1$ denotes the successor $\sigma(n)$ ([[thm-induction-principle]], [[def-nat-addition]]).

[L3] The order on $\mathbb{R}$ is reflexive, total and transitive: $a \le a$; for all $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds, so at least one of $a \le b$ and $b \le a$ holds; and $a \le b$ with $b \le c$ gives $a \le c$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case: $F_0 = \{a_0\}$, and $a_0 \in F_0$ with $a_0 \le a_0$ by reflexivity, so $a_0$ is both a maximum and a minimum of $F_0$; hence $P(0)$ holds. [base, A1, L1, L3]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume $P(n)$, that is, for all reals $a_0, \dots, a_n$ the set $F_n$ has a maximum and a minimum. [ih, A1]

2.1 Let $a_0, \dots, a_{n+1} \in \mathbb{R}$ be arbitrary; by the inductive hypothesis the set $F_n$ has a maximum $M$ and a minimum $m$, and $F_{n+1} = F_n \cup \{a_{n+1}\}$. [step 1.2, L1]

3.1 By totality at least one of $a_{n+1} \le M$ and $M \le a_{n+1}$ holds. If $a_{n+1} \le M$, then $M \in F_n \subseteq F_{n+1}$, every element of $F_n$ is $\le M$ because $M = \max F_n$, and $a_{n+1} \le M$ as well, so $M$ is a maximum of $F_{n+1}$. If $M \le a_{n+1}$, then $a_{n+1} \in F_{n+1}$, every $x \in F_n$ satisfies $x \le M \le a_{n+1}$ hence $x \le a_{n+1}$ by transitivity, and $a_{n+1} \le a_{n+1}$, so $a_{n+1}$ is a maximum of $F_{n+1}$. Either way $F_{n+1}$ has a maximum. [step 2.1, L1, L3]

3.2 Dually, at least one of $m \le a_{n+1}$ and $a_{n+1} \le m$ holds. If $m \le a_{n+1}$, then $m \in F_{n+1}$ and every element of $F_{n+1}$ is $\ge m$, so $m$ is a minimum of $F_{n+1}$. If $a_{n+1} \le m$, then $a_{n+1} \in F_{n+1}$ and every $x \in F_n$ satisfies $a_{n+1} \le m \le x$ hence $a_{n+1} \le x$ by transitivity, so $a_{n+1}$ is a minimum of $F_{n+1}$. Either way $F_{n+1}$ has a minimum. [step 2.1, L1, L3]

4.1 Since $a_0, \dots, a_{n+1}$ were arbitrary, $F_{n+1}$ has a maximum and a minimum for every such list, that is, $P(n)$ implies $P(n+1)$. [step 3.1, step 3.2, A1]

5.1 The base case and the inductive step give $P(n)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ by the induction principle; since a nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is exactly a set of the form $F_n$, every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has both a maximum and a minimum. [step 1.1, step 4.1, given, L2, discharge-induction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the stipulation is discharged.** Finiteness itself is defined later, in [[def-countable]], as equinumerosity with a von Neumann natural; with that definition in hand [[lem-finite-subsets-listable]] proves that a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and finite exactly when it is listable as $\{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$, which is the Given below. So nothing on this page rests on an assumption that is never paid for; it is paid for later, and the payment is recorded in `justified_by`.
- **Only the total order is used, never completeness.** The base case needs reflexivity, the inductive step needs totality and transitivity, and the induction itself runs over $\mathbb{N}$. The same induction works in any totally ordered field; what is recorded here is its specialisation to $\mathbb{R}$.
- Nonemptiness is essential: $\emptyset$ is finite and has no maximum ([[def-max-min]]). Finiteness is essential too: $\{x \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < x < 1\}$ is bounded and has no maximum ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Combined with claim 1 of [[lem-max-is-sup]], this says every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has a supremum, and that the supremum is attained, because it equals the maximum. The infimum half is *not* part of [[lem-max-is-sup]], which speaks only of maxima and suprema; it follows from the minimum proved here together with the reflection identity $\inf X = -\sup(-X)$ ([[lem-reflection]], [[thm-infimum-property]]).

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$, with
$|x|$ the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]). Then

$$|x| \ge 0; \quad |x| = 0 \iff x = 0; \quad -|x| \le x \le |x|; \quad |-x| = |x|; \quad |xy| = |x|\,|y|;$$

and, for every $c > 0$, one has $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and elements $x, y \in F$.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| = u$ if $u \ge 0$, and $|u| = -u$ if $u < 0$ ([[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Ordered-field order: trichotomy holds (for each $u$ exactly one of $u > 0$, $u = 0$, $u < 0$), $a < b$ means $b - a$ is positive, and sums and products of positives are positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Signs in products: $(-a)b = -(ab)$ and $(-a)(-b) = ab$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] Sign rules: a product of two elements of the same sign is positive, and a product of two elements of opposite sign is negative ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Case $x > 0$: by [L1] $|x| = x > 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; since $-x < 0$ we get $|-x| = -(-x) = x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -x < 0 < x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case pos, L1, L2, algebra]

1.2 Case $x = 0$: then $|x| = |0| = 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ holds with $|x| = 0$ and $x = 0$, while $|-x| = |0| = |x|$ and $-|x| = 0 \le 0 \le 0 = |x|$. [assume-case zero, L1]

1.3 Case $x < 0$: by [L1] $|x| = -x$, and [L2] gives $-x > 0$, so $|x| > 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; here $|-x| = -x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -(-x) = x \le x$ while $x < 0 < -x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case neg, L1, L2, algebra]

1.4 Case $x = 0$ or $y = 0$: then $xy = 0$, so $|xy| = 0$, and one of $|x|, |y|$ is $0$, whence $|x|\,|y| = 0 = |xy|$. [assume-case zerofactor, L1]

1.5 Case $x, y$ have the same sign (both positive or both negative): by [L4] $xy > 0$, so $|xy| = xy$, while $|x|\,|y| = xy$ by [L3] (for $x, y < 0$ this is $(-x)(-y) = xy$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case same, L1, L3, L4]

1.6 Case $x, y$ have opposite signs (one positive, one negative): by [L4] $xy < 0$, so $|xy| = -(xy)$, while $|x|\,|y| = -(xy)$ by [L3] (namely $x(-y)$ or $(-x)y$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case opposite, L1, L3, L4]

2.1 By trichotomy [L2] each $x$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.1-1.3, and in each we verified $|x| \ge 0$, that $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$, that $|-x| = |x|$, and that $-|x| \le x \le |x|$; hence all four hold for every $x$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, cases-exhaustive]

2.2 By trichotomy [L2] each pair $x, y$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.4-1.6, and in each $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$ for all $x, y$. [step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6, cases-exhaustive]

3.1 Let $c > 0$: if $|x| < c$ then $-c < -|x| \le x \le |x| < c$ by [step 2.1] and [L2], so $-c < x < c$; conversely if $-c < x < c$ then both $x < c$ and $-x < c$, and since $|x|$ equals $x$ or $-x$ by [L1], we get $|x| < c$, so $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$. [step 2.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b, c, d \in F$.

1. **Translation invariance.** If $a < b$ then $a + c < b + c$.
2. **Adding inequalities.** If $a < b$ and $c < d$ then $a + c < b + d$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b, c, d \in F$.

[L1] For $x, y \in F$, the relation $x < y$ means $y - x \in P$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] $P$ is closed under addition: if $u, v \in P$ then $u + v \in P$ (axiom O2 of [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a < b$; by the definition of the order this means $b - a \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.2 For every $c \in F$ the field identities give $(b + c) - (a + c) = b - a$. [algebra]

1.3 Assume moreover $c < d$; by the definition of the order this means $d - c \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.4 The field identities give $(b + d) - (a + c) = (b - a) + (d - c)$. [algebra]

2.1 Hence $(b + c) - (a + c) = b - a \in P$, which is exactly $a + c < b + c$, proving claim 1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1]

2.2 Since $b - a \in P$ and $d - c \in P$, closure under addition gives $(b - a) + (d - c) \in P$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, L2]

3.1 Therefore $(b + d) - (a + c) = (b - a) + (d - c) \in P$, which is exactly $a + c < b + d$, proving claim 2. [step 1.4, step 2.2, L1] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b \in F$.

1. If $a > 0$ then $a^{-1} > 0$.
2. If $0 < a < b$ then $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b \in F$.

[L1] $x > 0 \iff x \in P$; $x < 0 \iff -x \in P$; and for $x \neq 0$ exactly one of $x \in P$, $-x \in P$ holds ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Sign rules: a product of a positive and a negative is negative, a product of two positives is positive, and for $c > 0$ one has $a < b \iff ac < bc$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

[L3] $0 < 1$; in particular $1 \neq 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L4] $P$ is closed under addition, so $<$ is transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a > 0$, so $a \neq 0$ and its inverse $a^{-1}$ exists with $a \cdot a^{-1} = 1$; moreover $a^{-1} \neq 0$, since $a^{-1}$ has $a$ as its inverse while $0$ is non-invertible ($1 \neq 0$ by L3). [assume-hyp, L1, L3]

2.1 By trichotomy $a^{-1} \in P$ or $-a^{-1} \in P$; if $-a^{-1} \in P$, then $a > 0$ and $a^{-1} < 0$ give $a \cdot a^{-1} < 0$ by the sign rules, i.e. $1 < 0$, contradicting $0 < 1$; hence $a^{-1} \in P$, i.e. $a^{-1} > 0$, proving claim 1. [step 1.1, L2, L3, L1]

3.1 Assume $0 < a < b$; then $0 < b$ by transitivity, so by claim 1 both $a^{-1} > 0$ and $b^{-1} > 0$, and the sign rules give $a^{-1} b^{-1} > 0$. [assume-hyp, step 2.1, L4, L2, L1]

4.1 Multiplying $a < b$ by the positive $a^{-1} b^{-1}$ via the sign rules gives $a (a^{-1} b^{-1}) < b (a^{-1} b^{-1})$; since $a a^{-1} = 1$ and $b b^{-1} = 1$, this simplifies to $b^{-1} < a^{-1}$. [step 3.1, L2, algebra]

5.1 Together with $b^{-1} > 0$ from step 3.1, we conclude $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$, proving claim 2. [step 3.1, step 4.1] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field, with field structure as in [[def-field]], and for
$n \ge 1$ let $n \cdot 1_F$ denote the canonical natural number
$\underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$, defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$
and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$. Then for every $n \ge 1$:

- $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$;
- the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$;
- $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ and $(mn) \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F)$ for all $m, n \ge 1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ whose canonical naturals are defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, with $0 \cdot 1_F = 0$.

[L1] $0 < 1_F$ in every ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] The order is compatible with addition and positives are closed under addition: $a < b$ implies $a + c < b + c$, and $a > 0$, $b > 0$ imply $a + b > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 1$: by definition $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, and $1_F > 0$. [L1, base]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: assume $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for some fixed $n \ge 1$. [ih]

1.3 By the recursion, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F - n \cdot 1_F = 1_F > 0$, so $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$. [given, L1]

1.4 Additive identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ by the recursion, and if $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ then $(m+n+1) \cdot 1_F = (m+n) \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + (n+1) \cdot 1_F$. [given, algebra]

2.1 Inductive step: $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ is a sum of two positives, by the hypothesis and $1_F > 0$, hence $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Iterating 1.3, for $m < n$ one has $m \cdot 1_F < n \cdot 1_F$, so $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing and therefore injective on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$. [step 1.3, L2]

2.3 Multiplicative identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m \cdot 1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(1 \cdot 1_F)$, and the step $(m(n+1)) \cdot 1_F = (mn + m) \cdot 1_F = (mn) \cdot 1_F + m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F) + (m \cdot 1_F)(1_F) = (m \cdot 1_F)((n+1) \cdot 1_F)$ uses 1.4 and distributivity. [step 1.4, algebra]

3.1 By induction on 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for every $n \ge 1$; with the strict increase 2.2 and the identities 1.4, 2.3, every claim holds. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 1.4, step 2.3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b, c \in F$.

1. If $a > 0$ and $b > 0$ then $ab > 0$.
2. If $a > 0$ and $b < 0$ then $ab < 0$.
3. If $a < 0$ and $b < 0$ then $ab > 0$.
4. If $c > 0$ then $a < b \iff ac < bc$.
5. If $c < 0$ then $a < b \iff bc < ac$ (multiplication by a negative reverses order).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b, c \in F$.

[L1] For $x, y \in F$: $x < y \iff y - x \in P$; $x > 0 \iff x \in P$; $x < 0 \iff -x \in P$; and (trichotomy) for each $x$ exactly one of $x \in P$, $x = 0$, $-x \in P$ holds, so $0 \notin P$ and $x \in P \Rightarrow x \neq 0$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] $P$ is closed under multiplication: if $u, v \in P$ then $uv \in P$ (axiom O2 of [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] In any field, $(-u)v = -(uv)$ and $(-u)(-v) = uv$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] In any field, $0 \cdot u = 0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a > 0$ and $b > 0$, i.e. $a \in P$ and $b \in P$; closure gives $ab \in P$, so $ab > 0$, proving claim 1. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.2 Assume $a > 0$ and $b < 0$, i.e. $a \in P$ and $-b \in P$; closure gives $a(-b) \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.3 Assume $a < 0$ and $b < 0$, i.e. $-a \in P$ and $-b \in P$; closure gives $(-a)(-b) \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.4 Assume $c > 0$ and $a < b$, i.e. $c \in P$ and $b - a \in P$; closure gives $(b - a)c \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.5 Assume $c < 0$ and $a < b$, i.e. $-c \in P$ and $b - a \in P$; closure gives $(b - a)(-c) \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

2.1 Since $a(-b) = -(ab)$ by L3, step 1.2 gives $-(ab) \in P$, so $ab < 0$, proving claim 2. [step 1.2, L3, L1]

2.2 Since $(-a)(-b) = ab$ by L3, step 1.3 gives $ab \in P$, so $ab > 0$, proving claim 3. [step 1.3, L3, L1]

2.3 By distributivity $(b - a)c = bc - ac$, so step 1.4 gives $bc - ac \in P$, i.e. $ac < bc$: this is the forward direction of claim 4. [step 1.4, algebra, L1]

2.4 By L3 and distributivity $(b - a)(-c) = -((b - a)c) = -(bc - ac) = ac - bc$, so step 1.5 gives $ac - bc \in P$, i.e. $bc < ac$: this is the forward direction of claim 5. [step 1.5, L3, algebra, L1]

3.1 Conversely, assume $c > 0$ and $ac < bc$; by trichotomy exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds. If $a = b$ then $ac = bc$, contradicting $ac < bc$; if $b < a$ then the argument of step 2.3 applied to the pair $b < a$ gives $bc < ac$, so $bc - ac \in P$ (from $ac < bc$) while $ac - bc \in P$ (from $bc < ac$), putting the element $bc - ac$ and its negative $ac - bc$ both in $P$, which trichotomy forbids; hence $a < b$: this completes claim 4. [assume-hyp, step 2.3, L4, L1, algebra]

4.1 Conversely, assume $c < 0$ and $bc < ac$; by trichotomy exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds. If $a = b$ then $ac = bc$, contradicting $bc < ac$; if $b < a$ then the argument of step 2.4 applied to the pair $b < a$ gives $ac < bc$, so $ac - bc \in P$ (from $bc < ac$) while $bc - ac \in P$ (from $ac < bc$), putting the element $ac - bc$ and its negative $bc - ac$ both in $P$, which trichotomy forbids; hence $a < b$: this completes claim 5. [assume-hyp, step 2.4, L4, L1, algebra] ∎

## Statement

The map $q \mapsto \hat q$ ([[def-real-numbers]]) is an embedding of ordered
fields. Every real is approximated by rationals: for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and
rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ with
$|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$. Consequently, strictly between any two
reals lies a rational.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real $x = [(a_n)]$ and a rational $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] The orders of $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}$; ordered-field arithmetic ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Field arithmetic in $\mathbb{Q}$: $\varepsilon/2, \delta/4$ are positive rationals, and every nonzero rational $q$ has a reciprocal $1/q$ with $q \cdot (1/q) = 1$ ([[thm-rat-field]]).

[L3] Cauchy definition ([[def-rational-cauchy-sequence]]).

[L4] Real positivity via eventual rational lower bounds ([[def-real-order]]).

[L5] $\mathbb{R} = \mathcal{C}/\mathcal{N}$ is a field ([[thm-reals-field]]), and $0_{\mathbb{R}} = \hat 0$, $1_{\mathbb{R}} = \hat 1$ are the classes of the constant sequences ([[def-real-numbers]]). A multiplicative inverse there is unique: if $ab = 1_{\mathbb{R}} = ac$ then $b = b(ac) = (ba)c = c$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Embedding: constant sequences are Cauchy; $\hat q = \hat r$ iff the constant $q - r$ is null iff $q = r$; operations match termwise; and $q < r$ gives the constant lower bound $r - q > 0$, so $\hat q < \hat r$ and order is preserved and reflected. [L1, L4]

1.2 Fix $N$ with $|a_m - a_n| < \varepsilon/2$ for all $m, n \ge N$, and set $q = a_N$. [L3, L2]

2.1 The difference $\hat q - x$ has representative $(a_N - a_n)$ with $|a_N - a_n| < \varepsilon/2$ for $n \ge N$; hence both $\hat\varepsilon - (x - \hat q)$ and $\hat\varepsilon - (\hat q - x)$ have representatives eventually $> \varepsilon/2$, so both are positive: $|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$. [step 1.2, L4, L1]

2.2 Inverses: let $q$ be a nonzero rational. Then $\hat q \ne \hat 0 = 0_{\mathbb{R}}$ by the injectivity of step 1.1, and $1/q$ exists in $\mathbb{Q}$ by [L2]; since the operations match termwise (step 1.1), $\hat q \cdot \widehat{1/q} = \widehat{q \cdot (1/q)} = \hat 1 = 1_{\mathbb{R}}$. Inverses in $\mathbb{R}$ are unique by [L5], so $(\hat q)^{-1} = \widehat{1/q}$: the embedding preserves reciprocals. [step 1.1, L2, L5]

3.1 Density: let $x < y$; pick $\delta > 0$ rational and $N$ with the representative of $y - x$ eventually $> \delta$; set $\varepsilon = \delta/4$ and pick $q$ with $|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$; then $q' = q + 2\varepsilon$ satisfies $\hat q' - x \ge -\hat\varepsilon + 2\hat\varepsilon = \hat\varepsilon > 0$ and $y - \hat q' \ge \hat\delta - \hat\varepsilon - 2\hat\varepsilon = \hat\delta/4 > 0$, so $x < \hat q' < y$. [step 2.1, L4, L1, L2]

4.1 The rationals embed as an ordered subfield — injectively, preserving the order in both directions, the ring operations, and reciprocals — and they approximate every real arbitrarily well and separate any two reals. [step 1.1, step 2.2, step 3.1] ∎

## Statement

Let $A$ be at most countable ([[def-countable]]) and let $B \subseteq A$. Then
$B$ is at most countable.

The proof establishes the sharper statement about subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ from
which this follows: **a subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is finite if it is
bounded above, and countably infinite if it is not.**

**No choice principle is used.** This is the point of the lemma rather than a
footnote to it. The enumeration of an unbounded $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is built
by always taking the *least* element of $S$ above the previous one, and the least
element of a nonempty set of naturals is canonical
([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]): it is determined by $S$, not selected from it.
Replacing "least" by "some" would turn the construction into an appeal to
dependent choice.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An at most countable set $A$ and a subset $B \subseteq A$. Throughout, a natural number is the von Neumann natural, so that $0 = \varnothing$ and $\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]); that $n = \{\, m \in \mathbb{N} : m < n \,\}$, and in particular that every element of a natural number is a natural number, is [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]], proved earlier on this page from the additive order of [[def-nat-order]].

[L1] $A$ is finite when $A \approx n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$, countably infinite when $A \approx \mathbb{N}$, and at most countable when one of the two holds ([[def-countable]]).

[L2] $\approx$ is symmetric and transitive, an injection is a bijection onto its image, and the restriction of a bijection to a subset is a bijection onto the image of that subset ([[def-equinumerous]], [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L3] Well-ordering: every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L4] Strong induction: if for every $n$ the truth of $P(m)$ for all $m < n$ implies $P(n)$, then $P(n)$ holds for every $n$ ([[thm-strong-induction]]).

[L5] Recursion: for any set $X$, any $x_0 \in X$ and any $F : X \to X$ there is a function $h : \mathbb{N} \to X$ with $h(0) = x_0$ and $h(\sigma(n)) = F(h(n))$ ([[thm-recursion]]).

[L6] Order facts in $\mathbb{N}$: $m \in n \iff m < n$, $m \le n \iff m \subseteq n$, $n < \sigma(n)$, and $m < \sigma(n) \iff m \le n$ ([[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]); exactly one of $m < n$, $m = n$, $n < m$ holds, so $<$ is irreflexive and any two naturals are comparable ([[lem-nat-trichotomy]]); $\le$ is reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive and total ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]), whence $<$ is transitive, because $m < n < p$ gives $m \le p$ while $m = p$ would force $m = n$ by antisymmetry; $m < n \iff \sigma(m) \le n$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]).

[L7] Every nonzero natural is a successor ([[lem-nat-nonzero-is-successor]]).

[L8] Membership is irreflexive on $\mathbb{N}$: $k \notin k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, and every natural number is a transitive set ([[lem-nat-transitive-irreflexive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Since $A$ is at most countable there is a bijection $\varphi : A \to N_0$ where $N_0 = n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ or $N_0 = \mathbb{N}$; in either case $N_0 \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, and restricting $\varphi$ to $B$ gives a bijection of $B$ onto $S := \varphi[B] \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, so $B \approx S$. It therefore suffices to prove that every subset of $\mathbb{N}$ is at most countable, since then $S \approx n'$ or $S \approx \mathbb{N}$ and transitivity carries the conclusion back to $B$. [given, L1, L2, L6, suffices: every subset of N is at most countable]

1.2 Every subset of a natural number is finite: by strong induction on $n$, assume every subset of every $m < n$ is finite. If $n = 0$ then a subset $T \subseteq 0 = \varnothing$ is empty and $T \approx 0$. Otherwise $n = \sigma(m)$ by [L7], with $m < n$; given $T \subseteq \sigma(m) = m \cup \{m\}$, the set $T \setminus \{m\}$ is a subset of $m$, so the hypothesis at $m$ gives a bijection $u : T \setminus \{m\} \to k$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$. If $m \notin T$ then $T = T \setminus \{m\} \approx k$. If $m \in T$, extend $u$ by $u(m) := k$; since $k \notin k$ by irreflexivity of membership, the value $k$ is not already taken and the extension is a bijection $T \to k \cup \{k\} = \sigma(k)$. In both cases $T$ is finite, so the claim holds for $n$ and hence for all $n$. [L1, L2, L4, L6, L7, L8]

1.3 Case $S$ bounded: assume there is $b_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ with $s \le b_0$ for every $s \in S$. Then $s < \sigma(b_0)$ for every $s \in S$ by [L6], that is, $S \subseteq \sigma(b_0)$. [assume-case bounded, L6]

1.4 Case $S$ unbounded: assume that for every $b \in \mathbb{N}$ there is $s \in S$ with $b < s$. Then $S \ne \varnothing$, and for each $s \in S$ the set $\{\, t \in S : s < t \,\}$ is nonempty, so [L3] makes $\nu(s) := \min \{\, t \in S : s < t \,\}$ a well-defined element of $S$ with $s < \nu(s)$; this defines a function $\nu : S \to S$ with no arbitrary choices. [assume-case unbounded, L3, construct]

2.1 In the bounded case $S$ is a subset of the natural number $\sigma(b_0)$, hence finite by step 1.2, hence at most countable. [step 1.2, step 1.3, L1]

2.2 In the unbounded case apply [L5] with $X = S$, $x_0 = \min S$ (available by [L3] since $S \ne \varnothing$) and $F = \nu$: there is $e : \mathbb{N} \to S$ with $e(0) = \min S$ and $e(\sigma(n)) = \nu(e(n)) = \min \{\, t \in S : e(n) < t \,\}$ for every $n$. [step 1.4, L3, L5, construct]

3.1 For every $n$, $e(n) < e(\sigma(n))$ by the defining property of $\nu$; consequently $m < n$ implies $e(m) < e(n)$, by strong induction on $n$ (for $n = \sigma(j)$ and $m < n$ one has $m \le j$ by [L6], so either $m = j$, giving $e(m) < e(\sigma(j))$ directly, or $m < j$, giving $e(m) < e(j) < e(\sigma(j))$ by the hypothesis at $j$ and transitivity). Hence $e$ is injective: if $m \ne n$ then $m < n$ or $n < m$ by comparability, and irreflexivity forbids $e(m) = e(n)$. [step 2.2, L4, L6, L7]

3.2 For every $k$, $k \le e(k)$: again by strong induction, at $k = 0$ this is immediate, and for $k = \sigma(j)$ the hypothesis at $j$ gives $j \le e(j) < e(\sigma(j))$, so $j < e(k)$ and therefore $\sigma(j) \le e(k)$ by [L6], that is $k \le e(k)$. [step 2.2, L4, L6, L7]

4.1 $e$ is surjective onto $S$: let $t \in S$. The set $K = \{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : t \le e(k) \,\}$ contains $t$ by step 3.2, so $k^\ast := \min K$ exists by [L3]. If $k^\ast = 0$ then $e(0) = \min S \le t$ because $t \in S$, and $t \le e(0)$, so $e(0) = t$. Otherwise $k^\ast = \sigma(j)$ by [L7], and $j \notin K$ by minimality, so $e(j) < t$; then $t$ belongs to $\{\, u \in S : e(j) < u \,\}$, whence $e(k^\ast) = \min \{\, u \in S : e(j) < u \,\} \le t$, and with $t \le e(k^\ast)$ this gives $e(k^\ast) = t$. In both cases $t$ is a value of $e$. [step 2.2, step 3.2, L3, L6, L7]

5.1 In the unbounded case $e : \mathbb{N} \to S$ is therefore a bijection, so $S \approx \mathbb{N}$ and $S$ is countably infinite, hence at most countable. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L1, L2]

6.1 Every $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is either bounded above or not, so steps 2.1 and 5.1 cover all cases and every subset of $\mathbb{N}$ is at most countable; by the reduction of step 1.1 the subset $B$ of the at most countable set $A$ is at most countable. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 5.1, cases-exhaustive, L1, L2] ∎

## Remarks

- A subset of a countably infinite set may perfectly well be finite: $\{0, 1\}$ and $\varnothing$ are subsets of $\mathbb{N}$. This is exactly why the conclusion is "at most countable" and not "countably infinite", and it is why the library's convention that "countable" means "at most countable" ([[def-countable]]) keeps the statement free of case distinctions.

- The dichotomy proved here, bounded subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ are finite and unbounded ones are copies of $\mathbb{N}$, is the only structural fact about $\mathbb{N}$ the rest of the page needs. The enumeration $e$ built in the unbounded case is the increasing one, and it is unique with that property.

- The bounded case rests on the von Neumann encoding: "bounded by $b_0$" is literally "a subset of the set $\sigma(b_0)$", which is what makes the induction of step 1.2 an induction on a natural number rather than on an informal count. That translation is not a convention but a theorem, [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]], since the library's order on $\mathbb{N}$ is defined additively ([[def-nat-order]]) and not by membership.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with closure $\overline{A}$ as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]] and derived set $A'$ as in
[[def-limit-point-r]]. Write

$$E \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing \text{ for every real } \varepsilon > 0 \,\}$$

for the set of adherent points of $A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). Then:

1. $\overline{A} = E$.
2. $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$.
3. $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed superset of $A$: it is closed, it
   contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed $F$ with $A \subseteq F$.
4. $A$ is closed if and only if $A = \overline{A}$, if and only if
   $A' \subseteq A$.

Claim 3 is the content of the definition of $\overline{A}$ and is restated here
so that the four descriptions stand together; claims 1, 2 and 4 are the ones
that carry work.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, and the set $E$ of adherent points of $A$ as displayed in the Statement.

[L1] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; $F$ is closed when $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L2] $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$; $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) = N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$; and if $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ then $\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ and $N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] $\overline{A}$ is the intersection of the nonempty family of closed supersets of $A$; it is closed, it contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed superset of $A$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]).

[L4] $x$ is an adherent point of $A$ when every $N_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $A$, a limit point when every $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $A$, and $A'$ is the set of limit points ([[def-limit-point-r]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $A \subseteq E$: for $x \in A$ and any $\varepsilon > 0$ one has $x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$, so that intersection is nonempty. [L2, L4]

1.2 Let $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus E$; by the definition of $E$ there is a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$. [L4, choose]

1.3 Let $F$ be closed with $A \subseteq F$, and let $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus F$; since $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open there is a real $\eta > 0$ with $N_\eta(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus F$. [L1, choose]

2.1 For every $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ the radius $\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x|$ is positive and $N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, so $N_\delta(y) \cap A = \varnothing$ and $y \notin E$; hence $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$, and since $x$ was an arbitrary point of $\mathbb{R} \setminus E$ that set is open, that is, $E$ is closed. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L4]

2.2 From $N_\eta(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus F \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus A$ we get $N_\eta(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, so $x \notin E$; hence $\mathbb{R} \setminus F \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$, that is, $E \subseteq F$, for every closed $F \supseteq A$. [step 1.3, L4]

3.1 By steps 1.1 and 2.1 the set $E$ is a closed superset of $A$, so $\overline{A} \subseteq E$ by the leastness in [L3]; and $\overline{A}$ is itself a closed superset of $A$ by [L3], so step 2.2 applied to $F = \overline{A}$ gives $E \subseteq \overline{A}$. Hence $\overline{A} = E$, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, L3]

4.1 $E = A \cup A'$: if $x \in E$ and $x \notin A$ then for every $\varepsilon > 0$ some $a \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ exists, and $a \ne x$ because $x \notin A$, so $a \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ and $x \in A'$; conversely $A \subseteq E$ by step 1.1, and $A' \subseteq E$ because $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$. Combining with step 3.1 gives $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$, which is claim 2. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L2, L4]

5.1 Claim 4: if $A$ is closed then $A$ is a closed superset of itself, so $\overline{A} \subseteq A$ by [L3], while $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ by [L3], whence $A = \overline{A}$; conversely if $A = \overline{A}$ then $A$ is closed because $\overline{A}$ is. Finally $A = \overline{A}$ says $A = A \cup A'$ by step 4.1, and $A = A \cup A'$ holds exactly when $A' \subseteq A$. [step 4.1, L3]

6.1 Claim 3 is [L3] restated, and claims 1, 2 and 4 are steps 3.1, 4.1 and 5.1, so all four hold. [step 3.1, step 4.1, step 5.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Which claim does the work in practice.** Claim 1 is the one used almost
  everywhere below: to show a point lies in $\overline{A}$ one exhibits, for each
  $\varepsilon > 0$, a point of $A$ within $\varepsilon$ of it. Claim 2 is what
  separates the two ways a point can be adherent, by membership or by
  accumulation, and it is what makes the notion of an isolated point visible.

- **No special property of $\mathbb{R}$ is used.** The argument uses the
  definitions of open, closed, neighbourhood and closure, and the order enters
  only through the nesting property of neighbourhoods; neither the
  least-upper-bound property nor the Archimedean property appears at any step.
  The results of this page that do use them are flagged in
  [[rem-r-native-topology-scope]].

- **The sequential form is a separate theorem and costs more.** Replacing
  "every neighbourhood meets $A$" by "some sequence in $A$ converges to $x$" is
  [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]], and the passage from the
  first to the second spends the axiom of countable choice, since it selects one
  point of $A$ from each of infinitely many neighbourhoods. The characterisation
  proved above is choice free.

## Statement

For each $k \in \mathbb{N}$ let $I_k = [a_k, b_k]$ be a closed bounded interval
with $a_k \le b_k$ ([[def-interval]]), and suppose the family is **nested**:

$$I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k \qquad (k \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Write $\ell_k = b_k - a_k \ge 0$ for the length of $I_k$. Then:

1. $\displaystyle\bigcap_{k \in \mathbb{N}} I_k$ is **nonempty**. More precisely,
   with $a = \sup\{a_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$ and
   $b = \inf\{b_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$, both of which exist, one has $a \le b$
   and $$\bigcap_{k \in \mathbb{N}} I_k = [a, b].$$
2. $\displaystyle\bigcap_{k \in \mathbb{N}} I_k$ is a **single point** if and only
   if $\ell_k \to 0$ ([[def-real-limit]]).

Every hypothesis is load bearing. Dropping closedness makes the intersection
empty; dropping boundedness does the same; and dropping nonemptiness of the
individual intervals is vacuously fatal.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Closed bounded intervals $I_k = [a_k, b_k]$ with $a_k \le b_k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and $I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k$ for every $k$; the sequences $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ of reals ([[def-sequence]]); their ranges $A = \{a_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$ and $B = \{b_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$, both nonempty; and $\ell_k = b_k - a_k$.

[L1] Closed bounded intervals: $[a,b] = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : a \le x \le b\}$; it is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, it is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$, it has two distinct elements $a$ and $b$ when $a < b$, and its length is $b - a$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L2] Least-upper-bound property and uniqueness: a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ bounded above has a unique supremum; the supremum is an upper bound and is $\le$ every upper bound ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L3] Greatest-lower-bound property and uniqueness: a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ bounded below has a unique infimum; the infimum is a lower bound and is $\ge$ every lower bound ([[thm-infimum-property]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L4] Monotone sequences, and the fact that consecutive comparisons suffice: $x_k \le x_{k+1}$ for all $k$ makes $(x_k)$ nondecreasing, and $x_{k+1} \le x_k$ for all $k$ makes it nonincreasing ([[def-monotone-sequence]]).

[L5] Monotone convergence: a nondecreasing sequence whose range is bounded above converges to the supremum of its range, and a nonincreasing sequence whose range is bounded below converges to the infimum ([[thm-monotone-convergence]]).

[L6] Algebra of limits: if $u_k \to u$ and $v_k \to v$ then $u_k - v_k \to u - v$ ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]]).

[L7] A sequence of reals has at most one limit ([[lem-limit-unique]]).

[L8] Bounded above and bounded below, for a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-bounded-set]]).

[L9] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total and transitive, so any two indices $k, l$ admit an index $m$ with $k \le m$ and $l \le m$, namely the larger of the two ([[def-nat-order]], [[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Nestedness read on the endpoints: since $a_{k+1} \le b_{k+1}$, both $a_{k+1}$ and $b_{k+1}$ lie in $I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k$, so $a_k \le a_{k+1}$ and $b_{k+1} \le b_k$ for every $k$. [given, L1]

2.1 Hence $(a_k)$ is nondecreasing and $(b_k)$ is nonincreasing. [step 1.1, L4]

3.1 For all indices $k$ and $l$: choosing $m$ with $k \le m$ and $l \le m$ gives $a_k \le a_m \le b_m \le b_l$, so $a_k \le b_l$. [step 2.1, given, L9]

4.1 Every $b_l$ is therefore an upper bound of $A$ and every $a_k$ a lower bound of $B$; both sets are nonempty, so $a := \sup A$ and $b := \inf B$ exist and are unique. [step 3.1, L2, L3, L8]

5.1 $a \le b$: each $b_l$ is an upper bound of $A$, so $a \le b_l$ for every $l$ by leastness of the supremum; thus $a$ is a lower bound of $B$, and $a \le b$ by greatestness of the infimum. [step 4.1, L2, L3]

5.2 By monotone convergence, $a_k \to a$ and $b_k \to b$. [step 2.1, step 4.1, L5]

5.3 The intersection is exactly $[a,b]$: a real $x$ lies in every $I_k$ exactly when $a_k \le x \le b_k$ for every $k$, that is exactly when $x$ is an upper bound of $A$ and a lower bound of $B$, and by leastness of $a$ and greatestness of $b$ that holds exactly when $a \le x \le b$. [step 4.1, L1, L2, L3]

6.1 $\ell_k = b_k - a_k \to b - a$ by the algebra of limits. [step 5.2, L6]

6.2 Since $a \le b$, the interval $[a,b]$ is nonempty, so the intersection is nonempty; together with step 5.3 this is claim 1. [step 5.1, step 5.3, L1]

7.1 If $\ell_k \to 0$ then $b - a = 0$ by uniqueness of limits, so $a = b$ and the intersection is $[a,a] = \{a\}$, a single point. [step 5.3, step 6.1, L1, L7]

7.2 Conversely, if the intersection is a single point then $a = b$: it equals $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, and $a < b$ would give the two distinct elements $a$ and $b$. Hence $b - a = 0$ and $\ell_k \to 0$ by step 6.1. [step 5.1, step 5.3, step 6.1, L1]

8.1 Claim 1 is step 6.2 and claim 2 is the pair of implications in steps 7.1 and 7.2, so a nested sequence of nonempty closed bounded intervals has nonempty intersection, equal to $[a,b]$, and that intersection is a single point exactly when the lengths tend to $0$. [step 6.2, step 7.1, step 7.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **No Archimedean input is needed.** The lengths are handled entirely by the
  algebra of limits and the uniqueness of limits: $\ell_k$ always converges, to
  $b - a$, and the two directions of claim 2 are then the two directions of
  "$b - a = 0$". A proof that instead argues "if $b - a > 0$ then some $\ell_k$
  is smaller" does need the Archimedean property
  ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]]), and it is avoidable, so it is avoided.

- **Nestedness gives more than it is usually stated to give.** The intersection
  is not merely nonempty; it is the closed interval $[a,b]$, and $a$ and $b$ are
  the limits of the endpoint sequences. The single-point case is exactly the case
  in which those two limits agree, and that is what makes the nested interval
  property usable as a *construction* of a real number, as in
  [[ex-nested-intervals-single-point]].

- **This is one of the standard equivalents of completeness.** Nested intervals
  together with the Archimedean property imply the least-upper-bound property, so
  the implication proved here is not reversible for free: it is half of an
  equivalence whose other half needs the Archimedean hypothesis separately.
  [[rem-completeness-routes]] records where this library stands on those routes.

- **The witnesses for the two deleted hypotheses** are
  [[cex-nested-open-intervals-empty]], which keeps boundedness and drops
  closedness, and [[cex-nested-unbounded-closed-empty]], which keeps closedness
  and drops boundedness. Neither is used above; each shows that the corresponding
  hypothesis cannot be removed.

## Statement

Every complete ordered field $F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) is Archimedean:
for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$,
where $n \cdot 1_F$ is the canonical natural of the ordered field $F$
([[def-ordered-field]]). Equivalently, the canonical naturals are cofinal in $F$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $F$; write $A = \{\, n \cdot 1_F : n \ge 1 \,\}$ for the set of its canonical naturals.

[L1] Least-upper-bound property: every nonempty $S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound $\sup S \in F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Each canonical natural satisfies $n \cdot 1_F > 0$, one has $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L3] $0 < 1_F$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $F$ is not Archimedean: there is some $x \in F$ with $n \cdot 1_F \le x$ for all $n \ge 1$, that is, $x$ is an upper bound of $A$. [assume-contra]

2.1 The set $A$ is nonempty, since $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F \in A$, and it is bounded above by $x$. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 By the least-upper-bound property, $A$ has a least upper bound $s = \sup A \in F$. [step 2.1, L1]

4.1 Since $1_F > 0$, we have $s - 1_F < s$; as $s$ is the least upper bound, $s - 1_F$ is not an upper bound of $A$. [step 3.1, L3]

5.1 Hence there is some $m \ge 1$ with $m \cdot 1_F > s - 1_F$. [step 4.1]

6.1 Adding $1_F$ to both sides, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F > s$. [step 5.1, L2]

7.1 But $(m+1) \cdot 1_F \in A$, so $(m+1) \cdot 1_F \le s$ because $s$ is an upper bound of $A$, contradicting 6.1. [step 6.1, step 3.1, L2]

8.1 The assumption is therefore untenable, so $F$ is Archimedean. [step 7.1, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Statement

$\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-equinumerous]]): the rationals are
countably infinite ([[def-countable]]).

**No choice principle is used.** The one place where a reader expects a choice,
"pick a representative $a/b$ of each rational", is exactly where
[[lem-rat-positive-denominator]] applies: every rational *has* a representative
with positive denominator, so the map $(a,b) \mapsto [(a,b)]$ defined on
$\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ is already **surjective** onto $\mathbb{Q}$,
and countability follows from a surjection without ever selecting a
representative. The same device handles $\mathbb{Z}$, which is a surjective image
of $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ by construction ([[def-integers]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $\mathbb{Z} = (\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N})/\sim$ with quotient map $(a,b) \mapsto [(a,b)]$ ([[def-integers]]), and $\mathbb{Q}$ the set of classes $[(a,b)]$ of pairs of integers with $b \ne 0$ ([[def-rationals]]). Write $\mathbb{Z}_{>0} = \{\, b \in \mathbb{Z} : b > 0 \,\}$ ([[def-int-order]]).

[L1] Finite, countably infinite, at most countable, uncountable ([[def-countable]]).

[L2] Bijections, injections, surjections, composition; $\approx$ and $\preceq$ ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]], [[def-equinumerous]]).

[L3] A nonempty $X$ is at most countable iff there is a surjection $\mathbb{N} \to X$; and from such a surjection $s$ the map $x \mapsto \min\{\, k : s(k) = x \,\}$ is an injection $X \to \mathbb{N}$ ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]]).

[L4] There is a bijection $\beta : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-n-cross-n-countable]]).

[L5] A product of two at most countable sets is at most countable ([[thm-product-of-countable]]); a subset of an at most countable set is at most countable ([[lem-subset-of-countable]]).

[L6] Every rational is $[(a,b)]$ for some integers $a$ and $b$ with $b > 0$ ([[lem-rat-positive-denominator]]).

[L7] $\mathbb{N}$ embeds injectively in $\mathbb{Z}$ by $n \mapsto [(n,0)]$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]) and $\mathbb{Z}$ embeds injectively in $\mathbb{Q}$ by $k \mapsto [(k,1)]$ ([[lem-int-embeds-rat]]).

[L8] $\preceq$ in both directions gives $\approx$ ([[thm-schroder-bernstein]]).

[L9] The relation of [[def-int-order]] is a total order on $\mathbb{Z}$ compatible with the ring structure ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), and $\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \ne \varnothing$: on representatives $0 < [(a,b)]$ holds exactly when $b < a$ in $\mathbb{N}$ ([[def-int-order]]), and $0 < 1$ in $\mathbb{N}$, since $1 = \sigma(0) \ne 0$ ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]) while $0 < n$ for every nonzero natural $n$ (claim 4 of [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]); so the integer $[(1,0)]$ is positive.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The quotient map $\pi : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$, $\pi(a,b) = [(a,b)]$, is surjective, since every integer is by definition such a class; hence $\pi \circ \beta : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ is a surjection, and $\mathbb{Z} \ne \varnothing$, so $\mathbb{Z}$ is at most countable by [L3]. [given, L2, L3, L4]

1.2 The composite $\iota : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$, $n \mapsto [([(n,0)],1)]$, of the two embeddings of [L7] is injective, so $\mathbb{N} \preceq \mathbb{Q}$. [L2, L7]

2.1 $\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ is a subset of $\mathbb{Z}$, hence at most countable by [L5], and it is nonempty by [L9]; therefore $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ is at most countable by [L5] and nonempty, so [L3] provides a surjection $u : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$. [step 1.1, L3, L5, L9]

3.1 The map $\rho : \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_{>0} \to \mathbb{Q}$, $\rho(a,b) = [(a,b)]$, is well defined because $b > 0$ gives $b \ne 0$, and it is surjective by [L6]; hence $\rho \circ u : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$ is a surjection, $\mathbb{Q}$ is at most countable, and [L3] turns that surjection into an injection $j : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{N}$, so $\mathbb{Q} \preceq \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.1, given, L2, L3, L6]

4.1 From $\mathbb{N} \preceq \mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{Q} \preceq \mathbb{N}$, the Schröder-Bernstein theorem [L8] yields a bijection $\mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{N}$; hence $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ is countably infinite. [step 1.2, step 3.1, L1, L8] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why Schröder-Bernstein rather than a count.** The usual last line is "countable, and infinite because $\mathbb{N}$ injects into it". Turning that into a proof requires knowing that a set containing an injective copy of $\mathbb{N}$ is not finite, which is the pigeonhole principle, [[lem-pigeonhole]], proved earlier on this page. That route is now available, but it is a detour: [[thm-schroder-bernstein]] gets the bijection directly from the two injections already in hand, and it is choice free, so nothing is lost.

- **Lowest terms are not needed and are not available.** A frequent presentation injects $\mathbb{Q}$ into $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{N}$ by sending each rational to its representative in lowest terms. That map needs greatest common divisors, which this library has not developed. Working with a surjection instead of an injection avoids the issue entirely: repetitions in an enumeration are harmless ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]]).

- The proof shows in passing that $\mathbb{Z} \approx \mathbb{N}$, by the same two-injection argument applied to [L7] and step 1.1, and that $\mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{Q}^3$ and so on are countable ([[thm-product-of-countable]]). The contrast with [[thm-r-uncountable]] is the point of the page: adding all limits of rational approximations to $\mathbb{Q}$ changes the size of the set, not merely its arithmetic.

## Statement

Let $(N,0,\sigma)$ be a Peano system ([[def-peano-system]]), in particular the natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]). For any set $A$, any element $a \in A$, and any function $f : A \to A$, there is a unique function $g : N \to A$ such that $g(0) = a$ and $g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n))$ for all $n \in N$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** a Peano system $(N,0,\sigma)$, a set $A$, an element $a \in A$, and a function $f : A \to A$. Call a set $R \subseteq N \times A$ **closed** when $(0,a) \in R$ and, for all $n \in N$ and $x \in A$, $(n,x) \in R$ implies $(\sigma(n),f(x)) \in R$.

[L1] Induction holds in $N$: any $S \subseteq N$ with $0 \in S$ that is closed under $\sigma$ equals $N$ (axiom P3, [[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L2] In a Peano system $\sigma(n) \ne 0$ (P1) and $\sigma$ is injective (P2) ([[def-peano-system]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The set $N \times A$ is closed, so the collection of closed subsets of $N \times A$ is nonempty; let $g := \bigcap \{ R : R \subseteq N \times A \text{ closed} \}$, which is itself closed, since if every closed $R$ contains $(0,a)$ then so does $g$, and if $(n,x) \in g$ then $(n,x) \in R$ for each closed $R$, whence $(\sigma(n),f(x)) \in R$ for each such $R$, so $(\sigma(n),f(x)) \in g$. [given, construct]

2.1 Let $D = \{ n \in N : \exists x \in A,\ (n,x) \in g \}$; then $0 \in D$ since $(0,a) \in g$, and if $n \in D$ with $(n,x) \in g$ then $(\sigma(n),f(x)) \in g$ by closure, so $\sigma(n) \in D$; by induction $D = N$, hence $g$ relates every $n$ to at least one $x$. [L1, step 1.1]

2.2 Suppose $(0,b) \in g$ with $b \ne a$; then $g \setminus \{(0,b)\}$ still contains $(0,a)$ and is closed, since any generated pair $(\sigma(m),f(z))$ has $\sigma(m) \ne 0$ by P1 and so is never equal to $(0,b)$; this contradicts the minimality of $g$, so $a$ is the unique second coordinate paired with $0$. [L2, step 1.1]

3.1 Let $U = \{ n \in N : \text{there is exactly one } x \text{ with } (n,x) \in g \}$; then $0 \in U$ by step 2.2. [step 2.2]

4.1 Assume $n \in U$ with unique value $x$, so $(n,x) \in g$ and $(\sigma(n),f(x)) \in g$ by closure; if $(\sigma(n),c) \in g$ with $c \ne f(x)$, then $g \setminus \{(\sigma(n),c)\}$ contains $(0,a)$ because $\sigma(n) \ne 0$, and is closed, because a generated pair $(\sigma(m),f(z))$ with $(m,z) \in g \setminus \{(\sigma(n),c)\}$ can equal $(\sigma(n),c)$ only if $\sigma(m) = \sigma(n)$ and $f(z) = c$, but $\sigma(m) = \sigma(n)$ forces $m = n$ by injectivity, then $z = x$ by uniqueness at $n$, giving $f(z) = f(x) \ne c$, a contradiction; hence $g \setminus \{(\sigma(n),c)\}$ is closed and smaller than $g$, contradicting minimality, so $f(x)$ is the unique value at $\sigma(n)$ and $\sigma(n) \in U$. [L2, step 3.1, step 1.1]

5.1 By induction $U = N$, so together with the totality from step 2.1 the relation $g$ is a function $g : N \to A$; it satisfies $g(0) = a$, and closure with uniqueness gives $g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n))$ for all $n$. [L1, step 2.1, step 3.1, step 4.1]

6.1 If $h : N \to A$ also satisfies $h(0) = a$ and $h(\sigma(n)) = f(h(n))$, then the set $\{ n : g(n) = h(n) \}$ contains $0$ and is closed under $\sigma$, since $g(n) = h(n)$ implies $g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n)) = f(h(n)) = h(\sigma(n))$, so by induction it equals $N$, that is $h = g$. [L1, step 5.1] ∎

## Statement

Every nonempty subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ has a least element: there is $\ell \in S$ with $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A nonempty subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. Define $T = \{\, n \in \mathbb{N} : \text{every } m \text{ with } m \le n \text{ satisfies } m \notin S \,\}$ (informally, no element of $S$ is $\le n$).

[L1] Induction principle: a subset of $\mathbb{N}$ that contains $0$ and is closed under $\sigma$ equals $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L2] $m < n \iff \sigma(m) \le n$; consequently no $k$ satisfies $n < k < \sigma(n)$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]).

[L3] Exactly one of $s < n$, $s = n$, $n < s$ holds ([[lem-nat-trichotomy]]); and $n < s \iff \sigma(n) \le s$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]).

[L4] $\sigma$ is injective (Peano axiom P2) ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]).

[L5] $\sigma(a) + i = \sigma(a + i)$ for all $a, i$ (the left successor law, [[lem-nat-add-successor-left]]).

[L6] $0 + k = k$ for all $k$ ([[lem-nat-add-identity]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose $S$ is nonempty but has no least element. [assume-contra]

1.2 If $m < \sigma(n)$ then $m \le n$: by [L2] applied to $m$ and $\sigma(n)$ we get $\sigma(m) \le \sigma(n)$, say $\sigma(m) + i = \sigma(n)$; then $\sigma(m + i) = \sigma(m) + i = \sigma(n)$ [L5], so $m + i = n$ by injectivity [L4], hence $m \le n$. [L2, L4, L5]

2.1 First, $0 \in T$: if $0 \in S$ then $0 \le s$ for all $s \in S$, since $0 + s = s$ [L6], making $0$ a least element, contrary to the assumption; hence $0 \notin S$; moreover $m \le 0$ forces $m = 0$, because $m \ne 0$ would give $0 < m$ (as $0 + m = m$ [L6] with $m \ne 0$) while $m \le 0$ gives $m < 0$, and [L3] admits at most one of these; so every $m \le 0$ lies outside $S$. [step 1.1, L3, L6, given]

2.2 Next, $T$ is closed under $\sigma$: assume $n \in T$; if $\sigma(n) \in S$ then no $s \in S$ satisfies $s < \sigma(n)$ (else $s \le n$ by step 1.2, so $s \notin S$ because $n \in T$, a contradiction), hence $\sigma(n) \le s$ for all $s \in S$ by [L3], making $\sigma(n)$ a least element, contrary to the assumption; therefore $\sigma(n) \notin S$, and any $m$ with $m \le \sigma(n)$ satisfies $m = \sigma(n)$ or $m \ne \sigma(n)$; in the second case $m \le \sigma(n)$ together with $m \ne \sigma(n)$ gives $m < \sigma(n)$ by the definition of the strict order, hence $m \le n$ by step 1.2 and $m \notin S$ because $n \in T$, while in the first case $m = \sigma(n) \notin S$; so every $m \le \sigma(n)$ lies outside $S$, giving $\sigma(n) \in T$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L3]

3.1 By the induction principle [L1], from $0 \in T$ and closure under $\sigma$, $T = \mathbb{N}$; then for every $n$, taking $m = n \le n$ shows $n \notin S$, so $S = \varnothing$, contradicting nonemptiness; therefore $S$ has a least element. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L1, discharge-contradiction] ∎
