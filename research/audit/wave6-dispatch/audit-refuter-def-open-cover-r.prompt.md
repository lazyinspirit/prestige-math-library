You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as a
read-only adversarial proof-refuter for the published-page audit. You are
tool-less: you cannot open a file, run a command, browse, edit, or delegate.
Everything you may rely on is reproduced in the `This dispatch` section. Return
evidence only; Audit-Alpha alone adjudicates and edits.

## Triage — the standing rule (verbatim, binding on you)

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct
  citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

## Adversarial standard

Read the target's title, Statement/Definition/Example/Statement refuted, Facts &
Assumptions, every numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks.
Try to falsify the public claim and every load-bearing inference.

1. Compare every cited fact with the supplied source text before alleging that
   it is weak. Check domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, direction, conclusion,
   and whether the source licenses the exact use.
2. Check that the title and public statement assert no more than the proof
   establishes, and that every proof step uses only available premises.
3. Check both directions of biconditionals, uniqueness/existence claims,
   induction and limiting arguments, empty/zero/endpoint/degenerate cases,
   extended-real conventions, index shifts, and hidden division or choice.
4. Re-read Remarks as skeptically as a numbered step. A false mathematical
   remark is a defect even when the proof is sound.
5. When the target is marked `ai-generated`, actively search for a
   counterexample to its claim, witness, or refutation rather than merely
   checking prose consistency.
6. Treat a false public claim, logically invalid proof, missing necessary
   hypothesis, circularity, or materially inaccurate load-bearing citation as
   fatal. Do not inflate an expository omission or a gap closable within thirty
   seconds into a defect.

## Output format

Reply with exactly this structure and no preamble:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

If `DEFECTS`, give one block per finding:

```text
FINDING 1
  location: [exact title, section, fact label, or numbered step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [the exact mathematical assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, missing hypothesis, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]
```

Then always end with:

```text
BOUNDARY: [specific boundary/counterexample checks and their disposition]
SOURCES:  [confirm every supplied cited item used by the target was inspected]
CHECKED:  [confirm the title, public claim, every numbered step, and Remarks were read]

## Definition

Let $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with open sets as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

- An **open cover** of $K$ is a family $\mathcal{U}$ of open subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$ with $K \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{U}$.
- A **subcover** of $\mathcal{U}$ is a subfamily $\mathcal{V} \subseteq
  \mathcal{U}$ that is still an open cover of $K$.
- A subfamily $\mathcal{V} \subseteq \mathcal{U}$ is **finite** when
  $\mathcal{V} = \varnothing$ or there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and members
  $U_0, \dots, U_n$ of $\mathcal{U}$ with $\mathcal{V} = \{U_0, \dots, U_n\}$;
  repetitions in the list are allowed and harmless.
- $K$ is **compact** when every open cover of $K$ has a finite subcover:
  for every open cover $\mathcal{U}$ of $K$, either $K = \varnothing$ and the
  empty subfamily covers it, or there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
  $U_0, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{U}$ with
  $$K \subseteq U_0 \cup \dots \cup U_n .$$
- $K$ is **sequentially compact** when every sequence $(x_k)$ of reals with
  $x_k \in K$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-sequence]]) has a subsequence
  converging ([[def-real-limit]]) to some point of $K$; equivalently, when every
  such sequence has a subsequential limit ([[def-subsequential-limit]]) that
  lies in $K$.

**Compactness is a property of $K$ alone.** The covering families range over open
subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, not over sets open in some other ambient space, so the
notion defined here is compactness of $K$ as a subset of $\mathbb{R}$. Nothing
below relativises it to a smaller ambient field; where an ordered field other
than $\mathbb{R}$ is meant, as in
[[fs-closed-bounded-compact-without-completeness]], the whole vocabulary is set
up again there for that field.

**$\varnothing$ is compact and sequentially compact.** The empty subfamily covers
it, and there is no sequence with all terms in $\varnothing$, so both conditions
hold vacuously.

## Remarks

- **Why "finite" is spelled out by listing.** A finite subfamily is described
  here as one that can be written $\{U_0, \dots, U_n\}$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}$,
  which is exactly the form every proof on this page produces or consumes: the
  bisection argument of [[thm-heine-borel-r]] produces a one-member list, and
  the arguments of [[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]] consume a list by
  taking a maximum over it ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]). Since $\mathbb{N}$
  contains $0$, the shortest nonempty list is $\{U_0\}$.

- **The two notions are not defined to be equivalent, and their equivalence is a
  theorem.** For subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ it is
  [[thm-compact-iff-sequentially-compact-r]]; both of its implications run
  through the characterisation of compactness by closed and bounded, and its
  forward implication additionally uses Bolzano-Weierstrass. Neither implication
  is formal.

- **Compactness is not inherited by subsets, but by closed subsets.** A closed
  subset of a compact set is compact, which is immediate from
  [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]] once that is available, whereas
  $(0,1) \subseteq [0,1]$ shows that an arbitrary subset of a compact set need
  not be compact.

- **The empty cover.** If $K \ne \varnothing$ then no open cover of $K$ is
  empty, so the case distinction in the definition of compactness only ever
  matters for $K = \varnothing$; it is written out so that the definition does
  not quietly assume $K$ nonempty.

## Definition

Let $U, F \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]].

- $U$ is **open** when for every $x \in U$ there is a real $\varepsilon > 0$
  with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$.
- $F$ is **closed** when its complement $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open.
- A set is **clopen** when it is both open and closed.

The whole of the topology of $\mathbb{R}$ developed on this page rests on this
one definition: closedness is *defined* as openness of the complement, and every
other description of a closed set on this page is a theorem
([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]]).

**$\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen.** The condition defining openness
quantifies over the elements of the set, so it holds vacuously for
$\varnothing$; and for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ one has $N_1(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$,
so $\mathbb{R}$ is open. Since each of the two is the complement of the other,
each is also closed.

**Every neighbourhood is open.** Let $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and put
$\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x|$, which is $> 0$ because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$. The nesting property of [[def-neighbourhood-r]] gives
$N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$. So every point of $N_\varepsilon(x)$
has a neighbourhood inside it.

**The four open forms of [[def-interval]] are open sets.** Let $a, b \in
\mathbb{R}$.

- $(a,b)$: for $x$ with $a < x < b$, both $x - a > 0$ and $b - x > 0$, so
  $\delta := \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ is a positive real (the minimum of a
  two-element set of reals exists, [[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).
  If $|y - x| < \delta$ then $y > x - \delta \ge x - (x - a) = a$ and
  $y < x + \delta \le x + (b - x) = b$, so $y \in (a,b)$; hence
  $N_\delta(x) \subseteq (a,b)$.
- $(a,\infty)$: for $x > a$ take $\delta := x - a > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y > x - \delta = a$.
- $(-\infty,b)$: for $x < b$ take $\delta := b - x > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y < x + \delta = b$.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: already treated above.

**The four closed forms of [[def-interval]] are closed sets.** In each case the
complement is shown open directly.

- $[a,b]$: if $x \notin [a,b]$ then $x < a$ or $x > b$ by trichotomy
  ([[def-ordered-field]]). If $x < a$, take $\delta := a - x > 0$; every
  $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has $y < x + \delta = a$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. If
  $x > b$, take $\delta := x - b > 0$; every $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has
  $y > x - \delta = b$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. So
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus [a,b]$ is open.
- $[a,\infty)$: its complement is $(-\infty,a)$, which is open by the previous
  paragraph.
- $(-\infty,b]$: its complement is $(b,\infty)$, which is open.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: its complement is $\varnothing$, which is
  open.

## Remarks

- **Open and closed are not opposites, and not exhaustive.** A set may be
  neither: the half-open interval $[0,1)$ is neither open nor closed
  ([[fs-every-set-is-open-or-closed]]). A set may be both: $\varnothing$ and
  $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen. The words are inherited from the interval terminology
  of [[def-interval]], and the agreement between the two usages is exactly the
  two lists verified above: an interval called open there is an open set here,
  and an interval called closed there is a closed set here.

- **A clopen set is a disconnection waiting to happen.** If $A$ is clopen and
  both $A$ and $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ are nonempty, then each of the two is
  its own closure, so the two are separated in the sense of
  [[def-connected-r]] and $\mathbb{R} = A \cup (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)$ is a
  disconnection. Since $\mathbb{R}$ is order-convex it is connected
  ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]]), so no such $A$ exists:
  $\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are the only clopen subsets of $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The half-open forms are the ones the two lists omit**, and deliberately so:
  $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ with $a < b$ are neither open nor closed as subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The radius depends on the point.** Openness asks for *some* $\varepsilon$
  at each point, and that $\varepsilon$ may shrink to nothing as the point
  approaches the edge of the set, as the computation for $(a,b)$ shows: there
  $\delta = \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ tends to $0$ as $x$ tends to either endpoint.
  Asking instead for a single $\varepsilon$ that works simultaneously at every
  point of the set is a strictly stronger condition, and it is not what is
  defined here; nothing on this page uses it.

## Definition

A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals **converges** to $x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for
every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with
$|x_k - x| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$. It is **Cauchy** when for
every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with
$|x_k - x_l| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$.

## Remarks

- Quantifying over rational $\varepsilon$ loses nothing: below any real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ lies a positive rational ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).
- $|\cdot|$ is the absolute value of [[def-real-order]].

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]],
[[def-real-numbers]]) with its order and absolute value ([[def-real-order]]), and
$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers with its order ([[def-natural-numbers]],
[[def-nat-order]]).

A **sequence of reals** is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$. We write
$x_k$ for the value $x(k)$, call it the **$k$-th term**, and write $(x_k)$, or
$(x_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$, for the function itself. The **range** of $(x_k)$ is
the subset $\{\, x_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals and let $P$ be a property of indices.

- $(x_k)$ is **bounded** if there is $M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for
  every $k \in \mathbb{N}$; it is **unbounded** otherwise.
- $P$ holds **eventually** if there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $P(k)$ holds
  for every $k \ge K$.
- $P$ holds **frequently** if for every $K \in \mathbb{N}$ there is some
  $k \ge K$ for which $P(k)$ holds.
- For $K \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$K$-th tail** of $(x_k)$ is the sequence
  $x^{(K)}$ defined by $x^{(K)}_j := x_{j + K}$ for $j \in \mathbb{N}$; it is
  again a sequence of reals.
- A function $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is **strictly increasing** if
  $n_j < n_k$ whenever $j < k$. For such an $n$, the **subsequence** of $(x_k)$
  along $n$ is the composite $x \circ n$, written $(x_{n_k})_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$;
  it is again a sequence of reals.

**Convergence and Cauchyness are not defined here.** They are already fixed, for
sequences of reals, by the published [[def-real-limit]]: $(x_k)$ *converges* to
$x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is
$K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$, and $(x_k)$
is *Cauchy* when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$
with $|x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$. This page builds the
toolkit for those two notions and does not restate them. A sequence
**converges** if it converges to some real, and **diverges** if it does not.

## Remarks

- **Identification of $\mathbb{Q}$ with its image.** The map $q \mapsto \hat q$
  is an embedding of ordered fields ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and as is
  standard we write $q$ for $\hat q$, so that a rational may be compared with a
  real without further comment. [[def-real-limit]] is stated with the hat; every
  rational $\varepsilon$ occurring on this page is its image under this
  embedding.

- **Rational and real $\varepsilon$ agree.** [[def-real-limit]] tests convergence
  against every *rational* $\varepsilon > 0$, and its own remark records that
  this loses nothing. Spelled out: suppose that for every rational
  $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all
  $k \ge K$, and let $\eta > 0$ be an arbitrary *real*. Since $0 < \eta$,
  density of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) supplies a
  rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, and the index $K$
  belonging to that $\varepsilon$ satisfies $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon < \eta$ for
  all $k \ge K$. The converse implication is immediate, since every positive
  rational is a positive real. So the two formulations define the same relation,
  and the same two lines apply verbatim to the Cauchy condition and to any
  condition of the shape "for every $\varepsilon > 0$, eventually
  $\cdots < \varepsilon$". Proofs on this page therefore run the test with a real
  $\varepsilon$ wherever that is more convenient, and say so by citing this
  remark; nothing is smuggled in.

- **Constant sequences converge.** For $c \in \mathbb{R}$ the constant sequence
  $x_k := c$ converges to $c$, because $|x_k - c| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ for
  every $\varepsilon > 0$ and every $k$; it is bounded by $|c|$.

- **Eventually and frequently are dual.** $P$ holds frequently exactly when
  $\lnot P$ does not hold eventually, and $P$ holds eventually exactly when
  $\lnot P$ does not hold frequently. So the two quantifier patterns are
  negations of one another applied to the complementary property, and there is no
  third pattern hiding between them.

- **A sequence is not its range.** $(x_k)$ is a function, not a set, and the
  range does not determine the function: the sequence $x_0 = 0$, $x_k = 1$ for
  $k \ge 1$ and the sequence $y_0 = y_1 = 0$, $y_k = 1$ for $k \ge 2$ have the
  same range $\{0, 1\}$, yet they differ at $k = 1$, so they are different
  sequences. Order and repetition are part of the data and the range forgets
  both. Boundedness, on the other hand, depends only on the range.

- **Indexing.** Sequences here start at $k = 0$ because $\mathbb{N}$ contains
  $0$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]). Texts that index from $1$ describe the same
  objects up to a shift, and the shift changes nothing about convergence, by
  [[lem-limit-of-tail]].

## Definition

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]) and let $L \in \mathbb{R}$.
Then $L$ is a **subsequential limit** of $(x_k)$ when some subsequence of $(x_k)$
converges to $L$: that is, when there is a strictly increasing
$n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that

$$x_{n_j} \longrightarrow L \qquad (j \to \infty)$$

in the sense of [[def-real-limit]]. The **subsequential limit set** of $(x_k)$ is

$$\operatorname{SL}(x) \;:=\; \{\, L \in \mathbb{R} : L \text{ is a subsequential limit of } (x_k) \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}.$$

Both pieces of the definition are already fixed elsewhere and are only combined
here: *strictly increasing* and *subsequence* are [[def-sequence]], and
*converges* is [[def-real-limit]]. Nothing about $(x_k)$ itself is assumed; in
particular $(x_k)$ is not assumed to converge, and $\operatorname{SL}(x)$ may be
empty, a single point, or larger.

**A subsequence looks arbitrarily far out.** A strictly increasing index map
satisfies $n_j \ge j$ for every $j$ ([[lem-index-map-grows]]), so the indices
$n_j$ are cofinal in $\mathbb{N}$ and a subsequential limit is determined by the
behaviour of $(x_k)$ at arbitrarily large indices. Consequently no finite
initial segment of $(x_k)$ affects $\operatorname{SL}(x)$: a sequence and each of
its tails have the same subsequential limits.

**Terminology.** Some texts say *cluster point*, *limit point* or *accumulation
value* of the sequence for the same notion. This library says *subsequential
limit* throughout, reserving *limit point* for the topological notion of a limit
point of a set, which is a different thing: the set $\{x_k\}$ of values of the
constant sequence $x_k = 0$ has no limit point, while $0$ is a subsequential
limit of that sequence.

## Remarks

- **A convergent sequence has exactly one subsequential limit, its limit.** If
  $x_k \to x$ then every subsequence converges to $x$
  ([[lem-subsequence-inherits-limit]]), so every subsequential limit equals $x$
  by uniqueness of limits ([[lem-limit-unique]]); and $x$ itself is one, taking
  $n_j = j$, which is strictly increasing. So $\operatorname{SL}(x) = \{x\}$. The
  converse fails: $\operatorname{SL}$ being a single point does not force
  convergence, as the unbounded sequence of
  [[cex-unbounded-with-convergent-subsequence]] shows.

- **The subsequential limit set can be empty.** The sequence $x_k = k$ has no
  subsequential limit at all, since every subsequence is unbounded and an
  unbounded sequence does not converge ([[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]]).
  Bolzano-Weierstrass ([[thm-bolzano-weierstrass]]) says exactly that
  boundedness is what rules this out: for a bounded sequence,
  $\operatorname{SL}(x) \ne \emptyset$.

- **It can also be large.** The alternating sequence of
  [[lem-alternating-sequence]] has subsequential limit set $\{-1, 1\}$, and
  [[ex-two-subsequential-limits]] carries out that computation for a sequence
  that converges to neither. The systematic study of $\operatorname{SL}(x)$, in
  particular that it has a greatest and a least element for a bounded sequence,
  belongs to the $\limsup$ page and is not begun here.

## Statement

**False claim:** in every ordered field $F$ ([[def-ordered-field]]), a subset of
$F$ that is closed in $F$ and bounded is compact in $F$; consequently the
completeness hypothesis in [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]] is
unnecessary.

**How the claim must be read.** It speaks of an arbitrary ordered field, so the
whole vocabulary has to be available there, and it is: for $x \in F$ and
$\varepsilon \in F$ with $\varepsilon > 0$ put
$N^{F}_\varepsilon(x) := \{\, y \in F : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}$, using the
absolute value of [[def-abs-value]], which is defined in every ordered field;
call $U \subseteq F$ **open in $F$** when every $x \in U$ admits
$\varepsilon > 0$ in $F$ with $N^{F}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$, call
$C \subseteq F$ **closed in $F$** when $F \setminus C$ is open in $F$, call
$S \subseteq F$ **bounded** when some $\ell, u \in F$ satisfy $\ell \le s \le u$
for all $s \in S$, and call $S$ **compact in $F$** when every family of sets open
in $F$ whose union contains $S$ has a finite subfamily whose union already
contains $S$. These are the definitions of [[def-neighbourhood-r]],
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-bounded-set]] and [[def-open-cover-r]]
transposed word for word from $\mathbb{R}$ to $F$; with $F = \mathbb{R}$ they are
literally those definitions.

The refutation takes $F = \mathbb{Q}$ ([[def-rationals]],
[[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and the set of nonnegative rationals whose square is
below $2$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The ordered field $\mathbb{Q}$ and the set $S := \{\, q \in \mathbb{Q} : q \ge 0 \text{ and } q^2 < 2 \,\}$, together with the notions "open in $\mathbb{Q}$", "closed in $\mathbb{Q}$", "bounded" and "compact in $\mathbb{Q}$" as set out in the Statement. Here $2 := 1 + 1$ and $4 := 2 \cdot 2$ in $\mathbb{Q}$.

[A1] The false claim: in every ordered field, a closed bounded subset is compact.

[L1] $\mathbb{Q}$ is a field and the relation of its order makes it a totally ordered field: the order is total and transitive, adding a constant preserves it, and a product of positives is positive ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]], [[thm-rat-field]], [[def-rationals]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Absolute value in an ordered field: $|z| \ge 0$; $|z| = z$ for $z \ge 0$ and $|z| = -z$ for $z < 0$; and for $c > 0$ one has $|z| < c$ exactly when $-c < z < c$ ([[def-abs-value]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L3] No rational number squares to $2$ ([[fs-sqrt2-rational]]).

[L4] In an ordered field, squaring is strictly monotone on the nonnegatives: $0 \le a < b$ implies $a^2 < b^2$, and $0 \le a \le b$ implies $a^2 \le b^2$ ([[lem-of-square-monotone]]).

[L5] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, hence $0 < 2 < 4$ and $2 \ne 0$; a positive element has a positive inverse; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve an inequality ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $S$ is nonempty and bounded: $1 \in S$ because $1 \ge 0$ and $1^2 = 1 < 2$ by [L5]; and every $q \in S$ satisfies $0 \le q < 2$, since $q \ge 2 \ge 0$ would give $q^2 \ge 2^2 = 4 > 2$ by [L4] and [L5], contradicting $q^2 < 2$. [L1, L4, L5]

1.2 $S$ has no greatest element: let $q \in S$ and put $h := \min\{\, 1,\ (2 - q^2)(2q+2)^{-1} \,\}$, a definition by cases on the total order of $\mathbb{Q}$; here $2q + 2 > 0$ because $q \ge 0$, and $2 - q^2 > 0$, so both entries are positive and $h > 0$ with $h \le 1$. Put $r := q + h$, so $r > q \ge 0$. Then $h^2 \le h$ because $0 < h \le 1$, and $h(2q+1) \le (2-q^2)(2q+1)(2q+2)^{-1} < 2 - q^2$ because $(2q+1)(2q+2)^{-1} < 1$ and $2 - q^2 > 0$; hence $r^2 = q^2 + 2qh + h^2 \le q^2 + h(2q+1) < q^2 + (2 - q^2) = 2$, so $r \in S$ and $q < r$. [L1, L4, L5]

1.3 $S$ is closed in $\mathbb{Q}$: let $q \in \mathbb{Q} \setminus S$, so $q < 0$, or $q \ge 0$ and $q^2 \ge 2$, in which case $q^2 \ne 2$ by [L3] gives $q^2 > 2$. If $q < 0$, put $\varepsilon := -q > 0$; every $y$ with $|y - q| < \varepsilon$ satisfies $y < q + \varepsilon = 0$ by [L2], hence $y \notin S$. If $q \ge 0$ and $q^2 > 2$, then $q \ne 0$ since $0^2 = 0 < 2$, so $q > 0$; put $\varepsilon := \min\{\, q,\ (q^2 - 2)(2q)^{-1} \,\} > 0$, again a definition by cases. Every $y$ with $|y - q| < \varepsilon$ satisfies $y > q - \varepsilon \ge 0$, so $y^2 > (q - \varepsilon)^2$ by [L4], and $(q-\varepsilon)^2 = q^2 - 2q\varepsilon + \varepsilon^2 \ge q^2 - 2q\varepsilon \ge q^2 - (q^2 - 2) = 2$, whence $y^2 > 2$ and $y \notin S$. In both cases a neighbourhood of $q$ misses $S$, so $\mathbb{Q} \setminus S$ is open in $\mathbb{Q}$. [L1, L2, L3, L4, L5]

1.4 For $r \in S$ put $B_r := \{\, y \in \mathbb{Q} : y < r \,\}$; each $B_r$ is open in $\mathbb{Q}$, since $y \in B_r$ and $\varepsilon := r - y > 0$ give, for every $z$ with $|z - y| < \varepsilon$, the inequality $z < y + \varepsilon = r$ by [L2]. [given, L1, L2]

2.1 The family $\mathcal{U} := \{\, B_r : r \in S \,\}$ is a cover of $S$ by sets open in $\mathbb{Q}$: given $q \in S$, step 1.2 supplies $r \in S$ with $q < r$, so $q \in B_r$. [step 1.2, step 1.4, L1]

2.2 $\mathcal{U}$ has no finite subfamily covering $S$: the empty subfamily fails because $S \ne \varnothing$ by step 1.1; and a nonempty finite subfamily is $\{B_{r_0}, \dots, B_{r_p}\}$ with every $r_i \in S$, so an induction on $p$ using the totality of the order of $\mathbb{Q}$ produces $R := \max\{r_0, \dots, r_p\}$, one of the $r_i$ and hence a member of $S$; for each $i$ one has $r_i \le R$, so $R < r_i$ fails and $R \notin B_{r_i}$. Thus the element $R$ of $S$ lies in no member of the subfamily. [step 1.1, step 1.4, L1]

3.1 The set $S$ is bounded by step 1.1 and closed in $\mathbb{Q}$ by step 1.3, and by steps 2.1 and 2.2 it is not compact in $\mathbb{Q}$, while $\mathbb{Q}$ is an ordered field by [L1]. So the claim [A1] fails at $F = \mathbb{Q}$ and is false. [step 1.1, step 1.3, step 2.1, step 2.2, A1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the false claim gets wrong.** [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]]
  has two halves of very different strengths. The half that a compact set is
  closed and bounded ([[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]]) uses no
  completeness at all, only the Archimedean property and the existence of maxima
  of finite sets. The converse half is
  the one that rests on completeness, through [[thm-heine-borel-r]] and the
  nested interval property, and it is exactly the half refuted above.

- **Where the missing point is.** The cover of step 2.1 creeps up on a bound that
  $\mathbb{Q}$ does not contain. In $\mathbb{R}$ that bound exists, namely
  $\sqrt 2$ ([[thm-of-square-roots]]), and it is not rational
  ([[fs-sqrt2-rational]]); the set $S$ is thus closed in $\mathbb{Q}$ precisely
  because the point that would have to be adjoined to close it is absent from
  $\mathbb{Q}$. Read inside $\mathbb{R}$, the same set of numbers is bounded and
  not closed, and it is not compact there either.

- **This is a statement about ordered fields, and it is refuted in that
  generality.** One counterexample field suffices to refute a claim about every
  ordered field, and $\mathbb{Q}$ is the smallest one available here. Nothing
  above uses any ordered-field lemma outside its stated generality: [L2], [L4]
  and [L5] are all proved for an arbitrary ordered field, and the results of this
  page that are stated for $\mathbb{R}$ only are not applied to $\mathbb{Q}$.

- **The named witness** is [[cex-closed-bounded-in-q-not-compact]]; the
  refutation is carried out here.

## Statement

Let $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be compact ([[def-open-cover-r]]). Then $K$ is
closed ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) and bounded ([[def-bounded-set]]).

Two covers do the work, and they use the Archimedean property in its two
different forms. Boundedness is read off the cover of $\mathbb{R}$ by the
intervals $(-n,n)$, which needs the **cofinal** form, that the canonical naturals
exceed every real ([[thm-of-archimedean]]). Closedness is read off the cover of
$K$, for a point $x$ outside it, by the sets
$\{\, y : |y - x| > 1/n \,\}$, which needs the **reciprocal** form, that the
reciprocals of the naturals get below every positive real
([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]]); the cofinal form alone does not deliver it.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A compact set $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Throughout, $n$ denotes both a natural number $\ge 1$ and the canonical natural $n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ of $\mathbb{R}$, as is standard.

[L1] Open cover, finite subfamily and compactness: every open cover of $K$ has a subcover that is empty or of the form $\{U_0, \dots, U_p\}$ with $p \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L2] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; $K$ is closed when $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$ is open; each of the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$, $\mathbb{R}$ is an open set ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L3] $N_\varepsilon(x) = \{\, y : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L4] $K$ is bounded when there are $\ell, u$ with $\ell \le y \le u$ for every $y \in K$ ([[def-bounded-set]]).

[L5] Archimedean property, cofinal form: for every $z \in \mathbb{R}$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $z < n$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]]).

[L6] Archimedean property, reciprocal form: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]]).

[L7] Absolute value: $|z| \ge 0$, $|z| \ge z$, $|z| \ge -z$, and $|z| = 0$ exactly when $z = 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L8] Triangle inequality: $|p + q| \le |p| + |q|$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L9] Every nonempty finite set of reals has a maximum, which is one of its members ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L10] Canonical naturals: $n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ and $m \le n$ in $\mathbb{N}$ gives $m \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} \le n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]); reciprocation of positives reverses the order ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]); the order is total and transitive ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For each natural $n \ge 1$ put $W_n := (-n, n)$, an open set by [L2]. The family $\{\, W_n : n \ge 1 \,\}$ covers $\mathbb{R}$, hence covers $K$: given $y \in \mathbb{R}$, [L5] supplies $n \ge 1$ with $|y| < n$, and then $y \le |y| < n$ and $-y \le |y| < n$ by [L7], so $-n < y < n$. [L2, L5, L7]

1.2 Let $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus K$ and for each natural $n \ge 1$ put $V_n := \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : |y - x| > 1/n \,\}$, which is defined because $n > 0$ has a positive inverse by [L10]. Each $V_n$ is open: given $y \in V_n$, put $\delta := |y - x| - 1/n > 0$; for $z \in N_\delta(y)$ the triangle inequality [L8] gives $|y - x| = |(y - z) + (z - x)| \le |y - z| + |z - x| < \delta + |z - x|$, whence $|z - x| > |y - x| - \delta = 1/n$ and $z \in V_n$. The family $\{\, V_n : n \ge 1 \,\}$ covers $K$: for $y \in K$ one has $y \ne x$, so $|y - x| > 0$ by [L7], and [L6] supplies $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < |y - x|$, that is $y \in V_n$. [L3, L6, L7, L8, L10]

2.1 Apply compactness to the cover of step 1.1. If the finite subcover is empty then $K = \varnothing$ and $-1 \le y \le 1$ holds vacuously for $y \in K$; otherwise there are naturals $n_0, \dots, n_p \ge 1$ with $K \subseteq W_{n_0} \cup \dots \cup W_{n_p}$, and putting $N := \max\{n_0, \dots, n_p\}$ by [L9] we get $W_{n_i} \subseteq W_N$ for each $i$, since $n_i \le N$ gives $-N \le -n_i$ and $n_i \le N$ in $\mathbb{R}$ by [L10]. Hence $K \subseteq W_N = (-N,N)$ and $-N \le y \le N$ for every $y \in K$, so $K$ is bounded. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L4, L9, L10]

2.2 Apply compactness to the cover of step 1.2. If the finite subcover is empty then $K = \varnothing$ and $|y - x| > 1$ holds vacuously for $y \in K$, so take $M := 1$; otherwise there are naturals $n_0, \dots, n_p \ge 1$ with $K \subseteq V_{n_0} \cup \dots \cup V_{n_p}$, and putting $M := \max\{n_0, \dots, n_p\}$ by [L9] we get $V_{n_i} \subseteq V_M$ for each $i$, since $n_i \le M$ gives $0 < 1/M \le 1/n_i$ by [L10]. In both cases $K \subseteq V_M$, that is, $|y - x| > 1/M$ for every $y \in K$. [step 1.2, L1, L9, L10]

3.1 Consequently $N_{1/M}(x) \cap K = \varnothing$, since $y \in K$ has $|y - x| > 1/M$ while $y \in N_{1/M}(x)$ would give $|y - x| < 1/M$, which trichotomy forbids; so $N_{1/M}(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus K$. As $x$ was an arbitrary point of $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$, that complement is open and $K$ is closed. [step 2.2, L2, L3, L10]

4.1 $K$ is bounded by step 2.1 and closed by step 3.1, which is the assertion. [step 2.1, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the reciprocal form is unavoidable in step 1.2.** The sets covering $K$
  must exhaust the complement of the single point $x$, and the natural way to do
  that with open sets is to exclude a shrinking closed neighbourhood of $x$. The
  radii of those neighbourhoods have to become smaller than $|y - x|$ for each
  $y \in K$, and that is exactly the statement of
  [[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]]. The cofinal form [[thm-of-archimedean]] says
  the naturals get large, which is what step 1.1 needs and is a different
  assertion; the corollary exists in this library precisely so that the
  inversion between them is done once.

- **The converse needs completeness and this lemma does not.** Nothing above
  uses the least-upper-bound property except through the Archimedean property;
  beyond the ordered-field axioms the proof asks only for that property and for
  the existence of a maximum of a finite set. The converse, that a closed bounded
  set is compact, is false in $\mathbb{Q}$
  ([[fs-closed-bounded-compact-without-completeness]]) and true in $\mathbb{R}$
  ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]]).

- **Neither conclusion can be strengthened to an equivalence on its own.** A
  closed set need not be compact and a bounded set need not be compact, and both
  failures are recorded in [[cex-unbounded-closed-set-not-compact]].

## Statement

For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and all $a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n \in \mathbb{R}$, the
set $\{a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ has a maximum and a minimum ([[def-max-min]]).

What is proved below is exactly the displayed statement, by induction on $n$.

The usual reading, that *every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has a
maximum and a minimum*, follows once one identifies the nonempty finite subsets
of $\mathbb{R}$ with the sets listable as $\{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$. That
identification is recorded as a stipulation in the Given below, because this page
has no definition of finiteness to prove it against. **It is discharged, not
merely assumed**: [[lem-finite-subsets-listable]] proves that the two
descriptions of a nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ agree. That lemma is
recorded in `justified_by` rather than in `deps`, since it is about the sets this
lemma quantifies over and therefore depends on this one. This is what licenses
the notation
$\max\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ and $\min\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ for finite sets of
**real** numbers from this page onwards.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Real numbers $a_0, a_1, a_2, \dots$; for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write $F_n := \{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$, so that $F_{n+1} = F_n \cup \{a_{n+1}\}$. A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and finite exactly when it equals $F_n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and some choice of $a_0, \dots, a_n$.

[A1] $P(n)$ denotes the statement: for all $a_0, \dots, a_n \in \mathbb{R}$, the set $F_n$ has a maximum and a minimum.

[L1] Maximum and minimum: $m = \max X$ means $m \in X$ and $x \le m$ for all $x \in X$; $m = \min X$ means $m \in X$ and $m \le x$ for all $x \in X$; each is unique when it exists ([[def-max-min]]).

[L2] Induction principle: if $P(0)$ holds and $P(n)$ implies $P(n+1)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $P(n)$ holds for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, where $n + 1$ denotes the successor $\sigma(n)$ ([[thm-induction-principle]], [[def-nat-addition]]).

[L3] The order on $\mathbb{R}$ is reflexive, total and transitive: $a \le a$; for all $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds, so at least one of $a \le b$ and $b \le a$ holds; and $a \le b$ with $b \le c$ gives $a \le c$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case: $F_0 = \{a_0\}$, and $a_0 \in F_0$ with $a_0 \le a_0$ by reflexivity, so $a_0$ is both a maximum and a minimum of $F_0$; hence $P(0)$ holds. [base, A1, L1, L3]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume $P(n)$, that is, for all reals $a_0, \dots, a_n$ the set $F_n$ has a maximum and a minimum. [ih, A1]

2.1 Let $a_0, \dots, a_{n+1} \in \mathbb{R}$ be arbitrary; by the inductive hypothesis the set $F_n$ has a maximum $M$ and a minimum $m$, and $F_{n+1} = F_n \cup \{a_{n+1}\}$. [step 1.2, L1]

3.1 By totality at least one of $a_{n+1} \le M$ and $M \le a_{n+1}$ holds. If $a_{n+1} \le M$, then $M \in F_n \subseteq F_{n+1}$, every element of $F_n$ is $\le M$ because $M = \max F_n$, and $a_{n+1} \le M$ as well, so $M$ is a maximum of $F_{n+1}$. If $M \le a_{n+1}$, then $a_{n+1} \in F_{n+1}$, every $x \in F_n$ satisfies $x \le M \le a_{n+1}$ hence $x \le a_{n+1}$ by transitivity, and $a_{n+1} \le a_{n+1}$, so $a_{n+1}$ is a maximum of $F_{n+1}$. Either way $F_{n+1}$ has a maximum. [step 2.1, L1, L3]

3.2 Dually, at least one of $m \le a_{n+1}$ and $a_{n+1} \le m$ holds. If $m \le a_{n+1}$, then $m \in F_{n+1}$ and every element of $F_{n+1}$ is $\ge m$, so $m$ is a minimum of $F_{n+1}$. If $a_{n+1} \le m$, then $a_{n+1} \in F_{n+1}$ and every $x \in F_n$ satisfies $a_{n+1} \le m \le x$ hence $a_{n+1} \le x$ by transitivity, so $a_{n+1}$ is a minimum of $F_{n+1}$. Either way $F_{n+1}$ has a minimum. [step 2.1, L1, L3]

4.1 Since $a_0, \dots, a_{n+1}$ were arbitrary, $F_{n+1}$ has a maximum and a minimum for every such list, that is, $P(n)$ implies $P(n+1)$. [step 3.1, step 3.2, A1]

5.1 The base case and the inductive step give $P(n)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ by the induction principle; since a nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is exactly a set of the form $F_n$, every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has both a maximum and a minimum. [step 1.1, step 4.1, given, L2, discharge-induction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the stipulation is discharged.** Finiteness itself is defined later, in [[def-countable]], as equinumerosity with a von Neumann natural; with that definition in hand [[lem-finite-subsets-listable]] proves that a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and finite exactly when it is listable as $\{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$, which is the Given below. So nothing on this page rests on an assumption that is never paid for; it is paid for later, and the payment is recorded in `justified_by`.
- **Only the total order is used, never completeness.** The base case needs reflexivity, the inductive step needs totality and transitivity, and the induction itself runs over $\mathbb{N}$. The same induction works in any totally ordered field; what is recorded here is its specialisation to $\mathbb{R}$.
- Nonemptiness is essential: $\emptyset$ is finite and has no maximum ([[def-max-min]]). Finiteness is essential too: $\{x \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < x < 1\}$ is bounded and has no maximum ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Combined with claim 1 of [[lem-max-is-sup]], this says every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has a supremum, and that the supremum is attained, because it equals the maximum. The infimum half is *not* part of [[lem-max-is-sup]], which speaks only of maxima and suprema; it follows from the minimum proved here together with the reflection identity $\inf X = -\sup(-X)$ ([[lem-reflection]], [[thm-infimum-property]]).

## Statement

Let $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $K$ is compact if and only if $K$ is
sequentially compact ([[def-open-cover-r]]).

Neither implication is formal. Both are routed through the characterisation of
compactness by closed and bounded ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]]), and
the forward implication additionally uses Bolzano-Weierstrass
([[thm-bolzano-weierstrass]]). **The backward implication uses the axiom of
countable choice** ([[def-countable-choice]]): twice, once inside
[[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]] when a point of the closure is
turned into a sequence, and once directly in step 2.3, where an unbounded set
supplies one point beyond each natural bound.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Sequences are indexed by $\mathbb{N}$, which contains $0$ ([[def-sequence]]).

[L1] $K$ is compact when every open cover has a finite subcover, and sequentially compact when every sequence with all terms in $K$ has a subsequence converging to a point of $K$ ([[def-open-cover-r]], [[def-subsequential-limit]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L2] $K$ is compact exactly when $K$ is closed and bounded ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]]).

[L3] Bolzano-Weierstrass: a sequence $(x_k)$ of reals for which some $M$ satisfies $|x_k| \le M$ at every index has a subsequence converging to some real ([[thm-bolzano-weierstrass]]).

[L4] A point lies in $\overline{K}$ exactly when some sequence with all terms in $K$ converges to it, and $K$ is closed exactly when $\overline{K} = K$, exactly when $K$ is sequentially closed ([[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L5] $K$ is bounded exactly when there are $\ell, u$ with $\ell \le y \le u$ for all $y \in K$ ([[def-bounded-set]]).

[L6] Countable choice: for a family $(Y_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of nonempty sets there is $f$ with domain $\mathbb{N}$ and $f(k) \in Y_k$ for every $k$ ([[def-countable-choice]]).

[L7] A convergent sequence of reals is bounded ([[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]]); every subsequence of a convergent sequence converges to the same limit ([[lem-subsequence-inherits-limit]]); a sequence has at most one limit ([[lem-limit-unique]]); a strictly increasing $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ satisfies $n_j \ge j$ ([[lem-index-map-grows]]).

[L8] Archimedean property: for every real $z$ there is a natural $j \ge 1$ with $z < j$; canonical naturals satisfy $k \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} \ge 0$ and are increasing in $k$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L9] Absolute value: $|z| \ge z$, $|z| \ge -z$, $|z| \ge 0$, and $|z| = z$ for $z \ge 0$ while $|z| = -z$ for $z < 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L10] Every nonempty finite set of reals has a maximum, which is one of its members ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For the forward implication assume $K$ is compact; then $K$ is closed and bounded by [L2], so [L5] supplies $\ell, u$ with $\ell \le y \le u$ for every $y \in K$. Let $(x_k)$ be any sequence with $x_k \in K$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$. [assume-hyp, L2, L5]

1.2 For the backward implication assume $K$ is sequentially compact. [assume-hyp, L1]

2.1 The sequence of step 1.1 is bounded: put $M := \max\{|\ell|, |u|\}$ by [L10]; for each $k$, from $\ell \le x_k \le u$ we get $x_k \le u \le |u| \le M$ and $-x_k \le -\ell \le |\ell| \le M$, so $|x_k| \le M$ by [L9]. By [L3] there are a strictly increasing $n$ and a real $L$ with $x_{n_j} \to L$; every term $x_{n_j}$ lies in $K$ and $K$ is closed, so $L \in K$ by [L4]. Hence every sequence in $K$ has a subsequence converging in $K$, that is, $K$ is sequentially compact. [step 1.1, L1, L3, L4, L9, L10]

2.2 A sequentially compact $K$ is closed: let $y \in \overline{K}$; by [L4] there is a sequence $(a_k)$ with $a_k \in K$ for all $k$ and $a_k \to y$; by sequential compactness some subsequence $(a_{n_j})$ converges to a point $z \in K$; but that subsequence also converges to $y$ by [L7], and limits are unique by [L7], so $z = y$ and $y \in K$. Hence $\overline{K} \subseteq K$, so $\overline{K} = K$ and $K$ is closed by [L4]. [step 1.2, L1, L4, L7]

2.3 A sequentially compact $K$ is bounded: suppose it is not. Then for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ the set $Y_k := \{\, y \in K : y > k \text{ or } y < -k \,\}$ is nonempty, since $Y_k = \varnothing$ would mean $-k \le y \le k$ for every $y \in K$ and make $K$ bounded by [L5]. Use [L6] to fix $f$ with $f(k) \in Y_k$ and put $x_k := f(k)$; then $x_k \in K$, and $|x_k| > k$ for every $k$, because $x_k > k \ge 0$ gives $|x_k| = x_k > k$ while $x_k < -k \le 0$ gives $|x_k| = -x_k > k$ by [L9] and [L8]. By sequential compactness some subsequence $(x_{n_j})$ converges, hence is bounded by some real $M$ with $|x_{n_j}| \le M$ for all $j$ by [L7]; by [L8] fix a natural $j \ge 1$ with $M < j$, and then $|x_{n_j}| > n_j \ge j > M$ by [L7] and [L8], which contradicts $|x_{n_j}| \le M$. So $K$ is bounded. [step 1.2, L1, L5, L6, L7, L8, L9]

3.1 A sequentially compact $K$ is therefore closed by step 2.2 and bounded by step 2.3, hence compact by [L2]. [step 2.2, step 2.3, L2]

4.1 Step 2.1 is the forward implication and step 3.1 the backward one, so for subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ compactness and sequential compactness coincide. [step 2.1, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The equivalence is proved, not defined, and it is proved through the order.**
  Both directions pass through [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], whose
  backward half needs the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$, and the forward
  direction adds [[thm-bolzano-weierstrass]], whose proof spends completeness
  again. Nothing here transfers to a setting where those are unavailable; see
  [[rem-r-native-topology-scope]].

- **Where the choices are spent, and whether they can be avoided.** Step 2.3
  selects one point of $K$ outside $[-k,k]$ for each $k$, and
  [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]] selects one point of $K$ in
  each shrinking neighbourhood. Both are countably many independent selections
  from subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, for which this library has no canonical rule, so
  [[def-countable-choice]] is invoked rather than worked around. The forward
  implication, step 2.1, makes no such selection: the subsequence comes from
  [[thm-bolzano-weierstrass]] as a single object.

- **Sequential compactness is the form used in analysis; compactness is the form
  that is stated without sequences.** The extraction of a convergent subsequence
  is what proofs about continuous functions on $[a,b]$ actually use, while the
  covering definition mentions no sequence and no limit. This theorem is what
  lets a reader move between them for subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, and it is proved
  only there.

## Statement

Let $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $K$ is compact ([[def-open-cover-r]]) if and
only if $K$ is closed ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) and bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]).

This is the Heine-Borel theorem in the form used everywhere below. The forward
implication is [[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]] and spends no
completeness, only the Archimedean property and the existence of maxima of
finite sets; the backward implication rests on
[[thm-heine-borel-r]] and therefore on the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$, and the
remarks below record where it fails without completeness.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] Open cover, finite subfamily and compactness; the empty subfamily covers $\varnothing$ ([[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L2] A compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is closed and bounded ([[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]]).

[L3] Every closed bounded interval $[\ell,u]$ with $\ell \le u$ is compact ([[thm-heine-borel-r]]).

[L4] $K$ is closed exactly when $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L5] $K$ is bounded exactly when there are $\ell, u \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\ell \le y \le u$ for every $y \in K$ ([[def-bounded-set]]).

[L6] $[\ell,u] = \{\, z \in \mathbb{R} : \ell \le z \le u \,\}$ ([[def-interval]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 If $K$ is compact then $K$ is closed and bounded, which is [L2]; this is the forward implication. [L2]

1.2 For the backward implication assume $K$ is closed and bounded. If $K = \varnothing$ then every open cover of $K$ admits the empty subfamily as a finite subcover, so $K$ is compact. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.3 Assume moreover $K \ne \varnothing$; fix $s \in K$ and, by [L5], reals $\ell, u$ with $\ell \le y \le u$ for every $y \in K$. Then $\ell \le s \le u$, so $\ell \le u$, and $K \subseteq [\ell,u]$ by [L6]. [assume-hyp, L5, L6, choose]

2.1 Let $\mathcal{U}$ be an open cover of $K$ and put $\mathcal{W} := \mathcal{U} \cup \{\mathbb{R} \setminus K\}$. Every member of $\mathcal{W}$ is open, since $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$ is open by [L4], and $\mathcal{W}$ covers $[\ell,u]$: a point of $[\ell,u]$ either lies in $K$, hence in some member of $\mathcal{U}$, or lies outside $K$, hence in $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$. [step 1.3, L1, L4]

3.1 By [L3] the interval $[\ell,u]$ is compact, so some finite subfamily $\{W_0, \dots, W_p\}$ of $\mathcal{W}$ covers $[\ell,u]$, where the case of an empty subfamily is possible only when $[\ell,u] = \varnothing$, which is excluded by $\ell \le u$. Put $\mathcal{V} := \{\, W_i : W_i \in \mathcal{U} \,\}$, a finite subfamily of $\mathcal{U}$. Then $K \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{V}$: a point $y \in K \subseteq [\ell,u]$ lies in some $W_i$, and $W_i$ cannot be a member of $\mathcal{W}$ outside $\mathcal{U}$, because the only such member is $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$ and $y \in K$; so $W_i \in \mathcal{U}$ and $W_i \in \mathcal{V}$. [step 2.1, L1, L3, L6]

4.1 Every open cover of a nonempty closed bounded $K$ therefore has a finite subcover, so such a $K$ is compact; together with the empty case of step 1.2 this proves the backward implication, and step 1.1 is the forward one. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 3.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **A closed subset of a compact set is compact.** If $C \subseteq K$ with $K$
  compact and $C$ closed, then $C$ is bounded, being a subset of a bounded set,
  and closed by hypothesis, so it is compact by the theorem. The corresponding
  statement for arbitrary subsets is false: $(0,1) \subseteq [0,1]$ is bounded
  and not compact ([[cex-unbounded-closed-set-not-compact]]).

- **Both hypotheses are needed and neither implies the other.**
  [[cex-unbounded-closed-set-not-compact]] exhibits a closed set that is not
  bounded and a bounded set that is not closed, and neither is compact.

- **What the theorem is not.** It characterises compactness *for subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$*. The two halves are of very different strengths: the forward
  half is elementary and general, while the backward half rests on the
  completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ and fails over $\mathbb{Q}$
  ([[fs-closed-bounded-compact-without-completeness]], witnessed by
  [[cex-closed-bounded-in-q-not-compact]]). Nothing here licenses "closed and
  bounded implies compact" in any other setting.

## Statement

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a \le b$. Then the closed bounded interval
$[a,b]$ ([[def-interval]]) is compact ([[def-open-cover-r]]): every family of
open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ whose union contains $[a,b]$ has a finite subfamily
whose union already contains $[a,b]$.

The proof is by repeated bisection. Supposing some open cover admits no finite
subcover, one halves the interval, keeps a half that still admits none, and
iterates; the halves shrink to a point, which the cover does reach, and a single
member of the cover then swallows a whole late-stage half. **The halving rule is
canonical**, taking the left half whenever the left half works, so the recursion
uses [[thm-recursion]] and no choice principle.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a \le b$ and an open cover $\mathcal{U}$ of $[a,b]$; the set $X := \{\, (u,v) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} : u \le v \,\}$; and the following terminology: a pair $(u,v) \in X$ is **bad** when there are no $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $U_0, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{U}$ with $[u,v] \subseteq U_0 \cup \dots \cup U_n$, that is, when the interval $[u,v]$ admits no finite subcover from $\mathcal{U}$.

[L1] Open cover, subcover, finite subfamily and compactness ([[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L2] Closed bounded intervals: $[u,v] = \{\, z : u \le z \le v \,\}$ is nonempty exactly when $u \le v$; and for $u \le m \le v$ one has $[u,v] = [u,m] \cup [m,v]$, since $z \in [u,v]$ satisfies $z \le m$ or $m < z$ by trichotomy ([[def-interval]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$, and $N_\varepsilon(x) = \{\, y : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L4] Recursion: for a set $Y$, an element $y_0 \in Y$ and a function $G : Y \to Y$ there is $h : \mathbb{N} \to Y$ with $h(0) = y_0$ and $h(k+1) = G(h(k))$ for every $k$ ([[thm-recursion]]).

[L5] Nested interval property: if $[a_k,b_k]$ with $a_k \le b_k$ satisfy $[a_{k+1},b_{k+1}] \subseteq [a_k,b_k]$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, then $\bigcap_{k} [a_k,b_k] \ne \varnothing$ ([[thm-nested-interval-property]]).

[L6] Reciprocal Archimedean property: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]]).

[L7] Canonical naturals: $n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} > 0$ for $n \ge 1$, the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ is strictly increasing, and $(n+1) \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} = n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} + 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]); a positive element has a positive inverse and $0 < c \le d$ gives $0 < 1/d \le 1/c$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

[L8] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, hence $2 := 1 + 1 > 0$ and $2^{-1} > 0$; adding a constant preserves an inequality and multiplying by a positive preserves it ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

[L9] Absolute value: $|y - x| \le v - u$ whenever $x, y \in [u,v]$, because $|y - x|$ equals $y - x$ or $x - y$ and each is at most $v - u$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $[a,b]$ is not compact: some open cover $\mathcal{U}$ of $[a,b]$ has no finite subcover, that is, the pair $(a,b) \in X$ is bad. [assume-contra, L1]

1.2 Bisection rule: for $(u,v) \in X$ put $m := (u+v) \cdot 2^{-1}$, so that $u \le m \le v$ by [L8], and define $G(u,v) := (u,m)$ if $(u,m)$ is bad and $G(u,v) := (m,v)$ otherwise. This is a definition by cases on one condition, so $G : X \to X$ is a function and nothing is selected. [L2, L8, construct]

1.3 If $(u,v)$ is bad then $G(u,v)$ is bad: were both $(u,m)$ and $(m,v)$ not bad, concatenating the two finite lists of members of $\mathcal{U}$ would give a finite subfamily whose union contains $[u,m] \cup [m,v] = [u,v]$ by [L2], so $(u,v)$ would not be bad; hence at least one half is bad, and the rule returns the left half when it is bad and otherwise the right half, which must then be bad. [L1, L2]

2.1 Apply [L4] with $Y = X$, seed $(a,b)$ and map $G$: there is $h : \mathbb{N} \to X$ with $h(0) = (a,b)$ and $h(k+1) = G(h(k))$. Write $h(k) = (a_k,b_k)$, so $a_k \le b_k$ for every $k$, $(a_0,b_0) = (a,b)$, and $(a_{k+1},b_{k+1})$ is one of the two halves of $(a_k,b_k)$. [step 1.2, L2, L4, construct]

3.1 Every $(a_k,b_k)$ is bad, by induction on $k$: the case $k = 0$ is step 1.1, and if $(a_k,b_k)$ is bad then $(a_{k+1},b_{k+1}) = G(a_k,b_k)$ is bad by step 1.3. [step 1.1, step 1.3, step 2.1]

3.2 Writing $\ell_k := b_k - a_k \ge 0$, the intervals are nested and the lengths halve: $[a_{k+1},b_{k+1}]$ is $[a_k,m_k]$ or $[m_k,b_k]$ with $m_k = (a_k+b_k) \cdot 2^{-1}$, and each of these is contained in $[a_k,b_k]$ by [L2], while $m_k - a_k = b_k - m_k = \ell_k \cdot 2^{-1}$, so $\ell_{k+1} = \ell_k \cdot 2^{-1}$. [step 2.1, L2, L8]

4.1 For every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ one has $\ell_k \cdot (k+1) \le \ell_0$, by induction on $k$: at $k = 0$ this reads $\ell_0 \cdot 1 \le \ell_0$; and if it holds at $k$ then $\ell_{k+1} \cdot (k+2) = \ell_k \cdot 2^{-1} \cdot (k+2) \le \ell_k \cdot (k+1) \le \ell_0$, using $\ell_k \ge 0$ and $(k+2) \cdot 2^{-1} \le k+1$, which is $k + 2 \le 2k+2$, that is $0 \le k$. [step 3.2, L7, L8]

4.2 By [L5] the nested family $[a_k,b_k]$ of nonempty closed bounded intervals has a common point $x$; since $x \in [a_0,b_0] = [a,b]$ and $\mathcal{U}$ covers $[a,b]$, fix $U \in \mathcal{U}$ with $x \in U$ and then, $U$ being open, a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$. [step 3.2, L1, L2, L3, L5, choose]

5.1 There is $k \in \mathbb{N}$ with $\ell_k < \varepsilon$: the real $\varepsilon/(\ell_0+1)$ is positive because $\ell_0 + 1 > 0$, so [L6] supplies a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon/(\ell_0+1)$; put $k := n-1$, a natural number, so that $k+1 = n$ and step 4.1 with [L7] gives $\ell_k \le \ell_0 \cdot (1/n) \le \ell_0 \cdot \varepsilon/(\ell_0+1) < \varepsilon$, the last step because $\ell_0 < \ell_0 + 1$ forces $\ell_0/(\ell_0+1) < 1$ and $\varepsilon > 0$. [step 4.1, step 4.2, L6, L7, L8, choose]

6.1 For that $k$ one has $x \in [a_k,b_k]$, and every $y \in [a_k,b_k]$ satisfies $|y - x| \le \ell_k < \varepsilon$ by [L9], so $[a_k,b_k] \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; hence the one-member subfamily $\{U\}$ of $\mathcal{U}$ covers $[a_k,b_k]$ and $(a_k,b_k)$ is not bad, contradicting step 3.1. The assumption of step 1.1 is therefore untenable and $[a,b]$ is compact. [step 3.1, step 4.2, step 5.1, L1, L3, L9, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **What each hypothesis buys.** Closedness enters through [L5]: the nested
  interval property is stated for closed intervals and fails for open ones
  ([[cex-nested-open-intervals-empty]]). Boundedness enters through the same
  fact and through the length computation of step 3.2. Completeness of
  $\mathbb{R}$ enters only inside [[thm-nested-interval-property]] and, through
  [[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], in step 5.1.

- **Why the lengths are handled without powers.** The obvious route is
  $\ell_k = \ell_0 \cdot 2^{-k}$ together with the nullity of a geometric
  sequence, which is available ([[lem-geometric-sequence-null]]). The route
  taken instead, the one-line induction of step 4.1, gives the weaker bound
  $\ell_k \le \ell_0/(k+1)$, which is all step 5.1 needs, and it avoids
  integer powers and the algebra of limits entirely.

- **The recursion is over pairs, not over sets.** The state carried from stage
  to stage is the pair of endpoints, so [L4] applies with $Y = X$ and a total
  map $G$; had the rule been "choose a bad half", the state would have been
  chosen rather than computed and the argument would have needed dependent
  choice, which this library does not have.

- **The converse direction is a separate result.** That a compact subset of
  $\mathbb{R}$ must be closed and bounded is
  [[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]], and the two together give
  [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]].
