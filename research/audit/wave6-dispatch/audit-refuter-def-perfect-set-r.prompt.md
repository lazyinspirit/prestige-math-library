You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as a
read-only adversarial proof-refuter for the published-page audit. You are
tool-less: you cannot open a file, run a command, browse, edit, or delegate.
Everything you may rely on is reproduced in the `This dispatch` section. Return
evidence only; Audit-Alpha alone adjudicates and edits.

## Triage — the standing rule (verbatim, binding on you)

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct
  citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

## Adversarial standard

Read the target's title, Statement/Definition/Example/Statement refuted, Facts &
Assumptions, every numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks.
Try to falsify the public claim and every load-bearing inference.

1. Compare every cited fact with the supplied source text before alleging that
   it is weak. Check domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, direction, conclusion,
   and whether the source licenses the exact use.
2. Check that the title and public statement assert no more than the proof
   establishes, and that every proof step uses only available premises.
3. Check both directions of biconditionals, uniqueness/existence claims,
   induction and limiting arguments, empty/zero/endpoint/degenerate cases,
   extended-real conventions, index shifts, and hidden division or choice.
4. Re-read Remarks as skeptically as a numbered step. A false mathematical
   remark is a defect even when the proof is sound.
5. When the target is marked `ai-generated`, actively search for a
   counterexample to its claim, witness, or refutation rather than merely
   checking prose consistency.
6. Treat a false public claim, logically invalid proof, missing necessary
   hypothesis, circularity, or materially inaccurate load-bearing citation as
   fatal. Do not inflate an expository omission or a gap closable within thirty
   seconds into a defect.

## Output format

Reply with exactly this structure and no preamble:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

If `DEFECTS`, give one block per finding:

```text
FINDING 1
  location: [exact title, section, fact label, or numbered step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [the exact mathematical assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, missing hypothesis, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]
```

Then always end with:

```text

SOURCES:  [confirm every supplied cited item used by the target was inspected]
CHECKED:  [confirm the title, public claim, every numbered step, and Remarks were read]

## Definition

A set $P \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **perfect** when

- $P$ is closed ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), and
- $P$ has no isolated points ([[def-limit-point-r]]): no $x \in P$ admits a real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap P = \{x\}$.

**Equivalently, $P$ is closed and $P \subseteq P'$.** By
[[def-limit-point-r]], a point of $P$ is isolated in $P$ exactly when it is not
a limit point of $P$, so "no point of $P$ is isolated in $P$" says precisely
that every point of $P$ is a limit point of $P$, that is, $P \subseteq P'$.
Combined with the characterisation of closedness as $P' \subseteq P$
([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]]), a perfect set is exactly a set with
$P = P'$, though only the two conditions above are used below.

## Remarks

- **Both conditions are needed and neither implies the other.** The set
  $\{0\} \cup [1,2]$ is closed and has the isolated point $0$, so it is not
  perfect ([[cex-closed-set-with-an-isolated-point-is-not-perfect]]); the open
  interval $(0,1)$ has no isolated points and is not closed, so it is not
  perfect either.

- **$\varnothing$ is perfect**, vacuously: it is closed and has no points at
  all, hence no isolated ones. This is why
  [[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]] carries the hypothesis that $P$ is nonempty:
  the empty set is perfect and countable.

- **A nonempty perfect set is forced to be large.** It is uncountable
  ([[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]]), and the simplest examples are the
  nondegenerate closed intervals ([[ex-closed-interval-is-perfect]]). A perfect
  set need not contain any interval, the Cantor set being the standard example
  of that; it is not constructed anywhere in this library, and the statement is
  recorded here as orientation only, on the references above.

## Statement refuted

**Refuted claim:** every closed subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is perfect
([[def-perfect-set-r]]).

The witness is $E := \{0\} \cup [1,2]$. It is closed, being a union of two
closed sets ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]), and $0$ is an isolated point of it
([[def-limit-point-r]]), so the second clause of the definition of a perfect set
fails while the first holds.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The set $E := \{0\} \cup [1,2]$, where $\{0\} = [0,0]$ and $[1,2]$ are closed bounded intervals ([[def-interval]]).

[A1] The refuted claim: every closed subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is perfect.

[L1] A set is perfect when it is closed and no point of it is isolated in it; $x \in P$ is isolated in $P$ when some $N_\varepsilon(x)$ satisfies $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap P = \{x\}$ ([[def-perfect-set-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L2] Each interval of the form $[a,b]$ is a closed set, and a union of finitely many closed sets is closed ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-interval]], [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]).

[L3] $N_\varepsilon(x) = \{\, y : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}$, and $|y| = y$ for $y \ge 0$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L4] $0 < 1$, so $2 := 1 + 1 > 0$ and $0 < 1 \cdot 2^{-1} < 1$; the order is total and transitive ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $E$ is closed: $\{0\} = [0,0]$ and $[1,2]$ are closed sets by [L2], and their union is closed by [L2]. So $E$ is a legitimate instance of the claim [A1]. [A1, L2]

1.2 $0$ is an isolated point of $E$: certainly $0 \in E$; put $\varepsilon := 1 \cdot 2^{-1}$, which is positive and $< 1$ by [L4]. An element $y$ of $E$ is $0$ or lies in $[1,2]$, and in the second case $|y - 0| = y \ge 1 > \varepsilon$ by [L3] and [L4], so $y \notin N_\varepsilon(0)$. Hence $N_\varepsilon(0) \cap E = \{0\}$. [L1, L3, L4]

2.1 By step 1.2 the closed set $E$ of step 1.1 has an isolated point, so it is not perfect by [L1], and the claim [A1] is refuted. [step 1.1, step 1.2, A1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Only the second clause fails, and by one point.** Every point of $[1,2]$ is
  a limit point of $E$, by the computation in
  [[ex-closed-interval-is-perfect]]; the single point $0$ is what stops $E$ from
  being perfect. Deleting it leaves $[1,2]$, which is perfect.

- **Countability is the visible consequence.** A nonempty perfect set is
  uncountable ([[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]]). $E$ is uncountable too, since
  it contains $[1,2]$, so this example does not separate the two notions by
  size; what it shows is that closedness alone does not give perfectness. A
  countable closed set with isolated points is
  $\{\, 1/k : k \ge 1 \,\} \cup \{0\}$ ([[ex-reciprocals-with-zero-are-compact]]),
  and it is likewise not perfect.

- **The empty set is the degenerate case on the other side.** It is closed and
  has no isolated points, hence is perfect, and it is countable; that is why
  [[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]] assumes its perfect set is nonempty.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]] and closure as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]].

- $x$ is an **adherent point** of $A$ when $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne
  \varnothing$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$.
- $x$ is a **limit point** (or *accumulation point*) of $A$ when
  $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every real
  $\varepsilon > 0$: every punctured neighbourhood of $x$ meets $A$.
- $x$ is an **isolated point** of $A$ when $x \in A$ and there is a real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$.
- The **derived set** of $A$ is
  $$A' \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \text{ is a limit point of } A \,\}.$$
- $A$ is **dense in $\mathbb{R}$** when $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$.

**A limit point is an adherent point**, since $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq
N_\varepsilon(x)$; and an element of $A$ is an adherent point of $A$, since
$x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). So the adherent
points of $A$ are exactly the points of $A \cup A'$, a statement proved as part
of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

**Limit point and isolated point are exact opposites inside $A$.** For
$x \in A$: $x$ is an isolated point of $A$ exactly when it is not a limit point
of $A$. Indeed $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$ says precisely that
$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, because $x$ itself always lies in
$N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ when $x \in A$; so the existence of an $\varepsilon$
witnessing isolation is the negation of the condition defining a limit point.
A point of $A$ is therefore either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$, and
never both.

**A limit point need not belong to the set, and a point of the set need not be a
limit point.** Both possibilities occur, and the two examples that matter later
are $0$, which is a limit point of $\{\, 1/k : k \ge 1 \,\}$ without belonging
to it, and $0$ again, which belongs to $\{0\} \cup [1,2]$ as an isolated point.

## Remarks

- **Terminology: *limit point* here is about a set, never about a sequence.**
  This library reserves *subsequential limit* for the sequential notion
  ([[def-subsequential-limit]]), and the two are genuinely different: the
  constant sequence $x_k = 0$ has $0$ as a subsequential limit, while its set of
  values $\{0\}$ has no limit point at all. The distinction is the one
  [[def-subsequential-limit]] records under "Terminology", and it is respected
  throughout this page.

- **Density is defined through the closure, not through intervals.** Saying
  $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$ is equivalent to saying that every nonempty open
  subset of $\mathbb{R}$ meets $A$, and also to saying that every neighbourhood
  of every real meets $A$; the equivalences follow from
  [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] and are used in that form in
  [[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]].

- **The derived set need not be comparable with the set.** It can be strictly
  larger, as for $\mathbb{Q}$: every punctured neighbourhood of any real
  contains a rational, since density supplies one strictly between $x$ and
  $x + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]), so the derived set of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is all of $\mathbb{R}$. It can be strictly smaller, as for
  $\{0\}$, whose derived set is empty; and it can be neither, as for
  $\{0\} \cup (1,2)$, whose derived set is $[1,2]$, a set containing points
  outside the original and omitting the point $0$ of it. A closed set satisfying
  $A \subseteq A'$ is called perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]).

## Definition

Let $U, F \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]].

- $U$ is **open** when for every $x \in U$ there is a real $\varepsilon > 0$
  with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$.
- $F$ is **closed** when its complement $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open.
- A set is **clopen** when it is both open and closed.

The whole of the topology of $\mathbb{R}$ developed on this page rests on this
one definition: closedness is *defined* as openness of the complement, and every
other description of a closed set on this page is a theorem
([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]]).

**$\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen.** The condition defining openness
quantifies over the elements of the set, so it holds vacuously for
$\varnothing$; and for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ one has $N_1(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$,
so $\mathbb{R}$ is open. Since each of the two is the complement of the other,
each is also closed.

**Every neighbourhood is open.** Let $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and put
$\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x|$, which is $> 0$ because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$. The nesting property of [[def-neighbourhood-r]] gives
$N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$. So every point of $N_\varepsilon(x)$
has a neighbourhood inside it.

**The four open forms of [[def-interval]] are open sets.** Let $a, b \in
\mathbb{R}$.

- $(a,b)$: for $x$ with $a < x < b$, both $x - a > 0$ and $b - x > 0$, so
  $\delta := \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ is a positive real (the minimum of a
  two-element set of reals exists, [[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).
  If $|y - x| < \delta$ then $y > x - \delta \ge x - (x - a) = a$ and
  $y < x + \delta \le x + (b - x) = b$, so $y \in (a,b)$; hence
  $N_\delta(x) \subseteq (a,b)$.
- $(a,\infty)$: for $x > a$ take $\delta := x - a > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y > x - \delta = a$.
- $(-\infty,b)$: for $x < b$ take $\delta := b - x > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y < x + \delta = b$.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: already treated above.

**The four closed forms of [[def-interval]] are closed sets.** In each case the
complement is shown open directly.

- $[a,b]$: if $x \notin [a,b]$ then $x < a$ or $x > b$ by trichotomy
  ([[def-ordered-field]]). If $x < a$, take $\delta := a - x > 0$; every
  $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has $y < x + \delta = a$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. If
  $x > b$, take $\delta := x - b > 0$; every $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has
  $y > x - \delta = b$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. So
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus [a,b]$ is open.
- $[a,\infty)$: its complement is $(-\infty,a)$, which is open by the previous
  paragraph.
- $(-\infty,b]$: its complement is $(b,\infty)$, which is open.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: its complement is $\varnothing$, which is
  open.

## Remarks

- **Open and closed are not opposites, and not exhaustive.** A set may be
  neither: the half-open interval $[0,1)$ is neither open nor closed
  ([[fs-every-set-is-open-or-closed]]). A set may be both: $\varnothing$ and
  $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen. The words are inherited from the interval terminology
  of [[def-interval]], and the agreement between the two usages is exactly the
  two lists verified above: an interval called open there is an open set here,
  and an interval called closed there is a closed set here.

- **A clopen set is a disconnection waiting to happen.** If $A$ is clopen and
  both $A$ and $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ are nonempty, then each of the two is
  its own closure, so the two are separated in the sense of
  [[def-connected-r]] and $\mathbb{R} = A \cup (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)$ is a
  disconnection. Since $\mathbb{R}$ is order-convex it is connected
  ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]]), so no such $A$ exists:
  $\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are the only clopen subsets of $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The half-open forms are the ones the two lists omit**, and deliberately so:
  $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ with $a < b$ are neither open nor closed as subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The radius depends on the point.** Openness asks for *some* $\varepsilon$
  at each point, and that $\varepsilon$ may shrink to nothing as the point
  approaches the edge of the set, as the computation for $(a,b)$ shows: there
  $\delta = \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ tends to $0$ as $x$ tends to either endpoint.
  Asking instead for a single $\varepsilon$ that works simultaneously at every

## Example

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$. Then the closed interval
$E := [a,b]$ ([[def-interval]]) is perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]), and
therefore uncountable by [[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]].

This is a second proof of the uncountability of a nondegenerate interval. The
first, [[cor-interval-uncountable]], runs a trisection argument directly against
an assumed enumeration; the route here checks two purely local properties,
closedness and the absence of isolated points, and lets the perfect-set theorem
do the counting.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and the interval $E := [a,b] = \{\, x : a \le x \le b \,\}$.

[L1] A set is perfect when it is closed and no point of it is isolated in it; $x \in P$ is isolated in $P$ when some $N_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $P$ only in $x$ ([[def-perfect-set-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L2] Each interval of the form $[a,b]$ is a closed set ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L3] $N_\varepsilon(x) = \{\, y : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L4] Every nonempty perfect subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable ([[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]]).

[L5] For $a < b$ the intervals $[a,b]$ and $(a,b)$ are uncountable ([[cor-interval-uncountable]]).

[L6] Every nonempty finite set of reals has a minimum, which is one of its members ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L7] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 := 1+1 > 0$ and $0 < d \cdot 2^{-1} < d$ for $d > 0$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve inequalities; the order is total and transitive ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Verification

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $E$ is closed by [L2], and nonempty since $a \in E$. [L2]

1.2 No point of $E$ is isolated in $E$: let $x \in E$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real. If $x < b$, put $t := \min\{\varepsilon,\ b - x\} \cdot 2^{-1}$, which is positive by [L6] and [L7], and $y := x + t$; then $y > x$, and $y \le x + (b-x) \cdot 2^{-1} < b$ by [L7], while $y > x \ge a$, so $y \in E$ with $y \ne x$ and $|y - x| = t \le \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} < \varepsilon$. If $x = b$, then $x > a$; put $t := \min\{\varepsilon,\ b - a\} \cdot 2^{-1} > 0$ and $y := x - t$; then $y < x \le b$, and $y \ge b - (b-a) \cdot 2^{-1} > a$ by [L7], so $y \in E$ with $y \ne x$ and $|y - x| = t < \varepsilon$. In both cases $N_\varepsilon(x)$ contains a point of $E$ other than $x$, so no $\varepsilon$ isolates $x$. [L1, L3, L6, L7]

2.1 By steps 1.1 and 1.2 the set $E$ is closed with no isolated points, that is, perfect, and it is nonempty. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1]

3.1 By [L4] the nonempty perfect set $E$ is uncountable, which reproves for $[a,b]$ the first claim of [L5] along an independent route. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L4, L5] ∎

## Remarks

- **Nondegeneracy is exactly what is needed.** For $a = b$ the set $[a,a] =
  \{a\}$ is closed, its single point is isolated, and it is finite; the argument
  of step 1.2 breaks precisely there, since neither $x < b$ nor $x > a$ holds.
  This matches the hypothesis $a < b$ of [[cor-interval-uncountable]].

- **The open interval supplies only half of the definition.** The computation of
  step 1.2 applies verbatim inside $(a,b)$ and shows it has no isolated points,
  but $(a,b)$ is not closed, so it is not perfect. Perfectness needs both halves,
  which is why the example is stated for the closed interval.

- **Two proofs of one fact, sharing one ingredient.** Both routes spend the
  completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ exactly once, [[cor-interval-uncountable]] as a
  supremum and [[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]] through
  [[thm-nested-interval-property]]. They differ in everything else: the first
  trisects a given interval against a given enumeration, the second selects
  rational-endpoint intervals by least index. Neither is a corollary of the
  other.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with closure $\overline{A}$ as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]] and derived set $A'$ as in
[[def-limit-point-r]]. Write

$$E \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing \text{ for every real } \varepsilon > 0 \,\}$$

for the set of adherent points of $A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). Then:

1. $\overline{A} = E$.
2. $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$.
3. $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed superset of $A$: it is closed, it
   contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed $F$ with $A \subseteq F$.
4. $A$ is closed if and only if $A = \overline{A}$, if and only if
   $A' \subseteq A$.

Claim 3 is the content of the definition of $\overline{A}$ and is restated here
so that the four descriptions stand together; claims 1, 2 and 4 are the ones
that carry work.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, and the set $E$ of adherent points of $A$ as displayed in the Statement.

[L1] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; $F$ is closed when $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L2] $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$; $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) = N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$; and if $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ then $\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ and $N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] $\overline{A}$ is the intersection of the nonempty family of closed supersets of $A$; it is closed, it contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed superset of $A$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]).

[L4] $x$ is an adherent point of $A$ when every $N_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $A$, a limit point when every $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $A$, and $A'$ is the set of limit points ([[def-limit-point-r]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $A \subseteq E$: for $x \in A$ and any $\varepsilon > 0$ one has $x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$, so that intersection is nonempty. [L2, L4]

1.2 Let $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus E$; by the definition of $E$ there is a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$. [L4, choose]

1.3 Let $F$ be closed with $A \subseteq F$, and let $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus F$; since $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open there is a real $\eta > 0$ with $N_\eta(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus F$. [L1, choose]

2.1 For every $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ the radius $\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x|$ is positive and $N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, so $N_\delta(y) \cap A = \varnothing$ and $y \notin E$; hence $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$, and since $x$ was an arbitrary point of $\mathbb{R} \setminus E$ that set is open, that is, $E$ is closed. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L4]

2.2 From $N_\eta(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus F \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus A$ we get $N_\eta(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, so $x \notin E$; hence $\mathbb{R} \setminus F \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$, that is, $E \subseteq F$, for every closed $F \supseteq A$. [step 1.3, L4]

3.1 By steps 1.1 and 2.1 the set $E$ is a closed superset of $A$, so $\overline{A} \subseteq E$ by the leastness in [L3]; and $\overline{A}$ is itself a closed superset of $A$ by [L3], so step 2.2 applied to $F = \overline{A}$ gives $E \subseteq \overline{A}$. Hence $\overline{A} = E$, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, L3]

4.1 $E = A \cup A'$: if $x \in E$ and $x \notin A$ then for every $\varepsilon > 0$ some $a \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ exists, and $a \ne x$ because $x \notin A$, so $a \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ and $x \in A'$; conversely $A \subseteq E$ by step 1.1, and $A' \subseteq E$ because $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$. Combining with step 3.1 gives $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$, which is claim 2. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L2, L4]

5.1 Claim 4: if $A$ is closed then $A$ is a closed superset of itself, so $\overline{A} \subseteq A$ by [L3], while $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ by [L3], whence $A = \overline{A}$; conversely if $A = \overline{A}$ then $A$ is closed because $\overline{A}$ is. Finally $A = \overline{A}$ says $A = A \cup A'$ by step 4.1, and $A = A \cup A'$ holds exactly when $A' \subseteq A$. [step 4.1, L3]

6.1 Claim 3 is [L3] restated, and claims 1, 2 and 4 are steps 3.1, 4.1 and 5.1, so all four hold. [step 3.1, step 4.1, step 5.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Which claim does the work in practice.** Claim 1 is the one used almost
  everywhere below: to show a point lies in $\overline{A}$ one exhibits, for each
  $\varepsilon > 0$, a point of $A$ within $\varepsilon$ of it. Claim 2 is what
  separates the two ways a point can be adherent, by membership or by
  accumulation, and it is what makes the notion of an isolated point visible.

- **No special property of $\mathbb{R}$ is used.** The argument uses the
  definitions of open, closed, neighbourhood and closure, and the order enters
  only through the nesting property of neighbourhoods; neither the
  least-upper-bound property nor the Archimedean property appears at any step.
  The results of this page that do use them are flagged in
  [[rem-r-native-topology-scope]].

- **The sequential form is a separate theorem and costs more.** Replacing
  "every neighbourhood meets $A$" by "some sequence in $A$ converges to $x$" is
  [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]], and the passage from the
  first to the second spends the axiom of countable choice, since it selects one
  point of $A$ from each of infinitely many neighbourhoods. The characterisation
  proved above is choice free.

## Statement

Let $P \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be nonempty and perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]).
Then $P$ is uncountable ([[def-countable]]).

**The selection is canonical, so that this proof spends no dependent choice.**
The textbook proof shrinks a neighbourhood at every stage by *choosing* a point
of $P$ and then a radius, a choice made infinitely often and each time depending
on the previous one: that is the axiom of dependent choice
([[def-dependent-choice]]), which is not available at this point in the reading
order; only the axiom of countable choice is, and it does not
licence a recursive selection. The construction below therefore fixes an
enumeration $e$ of the rationals once ([[thm-rationals-countable]],
[[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) and, at every stage, takes the interval with
**least-indexed rational endpoints** meeting the requirements. The requirements
are met by some rational-endpoint interval, which is what step 2.1 proves, and
the least such index is determined by [[thm-well-ordering-principle]], so the
whole recursion is a single application of [[thm-recursion]] to a total map and
no choice principle is used anywhere.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A nonempty perfect set $P \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Write $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the image of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ under $q \mapsto \hat q$. A pair $(p,q) \in \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \times \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is called **good** when $p < q$ and $(p,q) \cap P \ne \varnothing$, and $G$ denotes the set of good pairs.

[L1] $P$ is perfect: $P$ is closed and every $x \in P$ is a limit point of $P$, so every punctured neighbourhood of $x$ meets $P$ ([[def-perfect-set-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L2] $\overline{A}$ is the set of points every neighbourhood of which meets $A$, and $A$ is closed exactly when $A = \overline{A}$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L3] $N_\varepsilon(x) = (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon)$; $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$; $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) = N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\}$; and $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ with $0 < \delta \le \varepsilon - |y - x|$ gives $N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L4] Intervals: $(p,q)$ is an open set and $[p,q]$ is a closed bounded interval, nonempty when $p \le q$ ([[def-interval]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L5] A nonempty at most countable set admits a surjection from $\mathbb{N}$; uncountable means not at most countable ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]], [[def-countable]]).

[L6] $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-rationals-countable]]); $q \mapsto \hat q$ is injective with image $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and strictly between any two reals lies an element of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]); a composition of bijections is a bijection ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]], [[def-equinumerous]]).

[L7] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L8] Recursion: for a set $Y$, an element $y_0 \in Y$ and a function $T : Y \to Y$ there is $h : \mathbb{N} \to Y$ with $h(0) = y_0$ and $h(\sigma(k)) = T(h(k))$ ([[thm-recursion]]).

[L9] Nested interval property: for nonempty closed bounded intervals $I_k = [a_k,b_k]$ with $I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k$, the intersection is nonempty, and it is a single point exactly when the lengths $b_k - a_k$ tend to $0$ ([[thm-nested-interval-property]]).

[L10] Reciprocal Archimedean property: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]]); canonical naturals are positive and increasing, and reciprocation of positives reverses the order ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

[L11] Every nonempty finite set of reals has a minimum, which is one of its members ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]); $0 < 1$, so $2 := 1+1 > 0$ and $0 < d \cdot 2^{-1} < d$ for $d > 0$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve inequalities ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

[L12] Convergence of a sequence of reals to $0$ is tested against rational $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-real-limit]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L13] Absolute value: $|z| \ge 0$, and $|y - x| \le b - a$ whenever $x, y \in [a,b]$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that the nonempty perfect set $P$ is at most countable; by [L5] fix a surjection $f : \mathbb{N} \to P$. [assume-contra, L5, choose]

1.2 By [L6] fix a bijection $\beta : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$ and put $e := \iota \circ \beta$ with $\iota(q) = \hat q$, a bijection from $\mathbb{N}$ onto $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$. [L6, choose]

1.3 Recall the terminology of the Given: a pair $(p,q)$ of elements of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is good when $p < q$ and $(p,q) \cap P \ne \varnothing$, and $G$ is the set of good pairs. [given, construct]

2.1 **Refinement claim.** For every good $(p,q)$, every $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and every real $\eta > 0$ there is a good $(p',q')$ with $[p',q'] \subseteq (p,q)$, $x \notin [p',q']$ and $q' - p' < \eta$. To see it, fix $y \in (p,q) \cap P$ and, $(p,q)$ being open, a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(y) \subseteq (p,q)$; since $y \in P$ is not isolated, [L1] gives $z \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(y) \cap P$, so $z \in P \cap (p,q)$ and $z \ne y$. At least one of $y, z$ differs from $x$; let $w$ be $y$ if $y \ne x$ and $z$ otherwise, so $w \in P \cap N_\varepsilon(y)$ and $w \ne x$. Put $\delta := \min\{\, \varepsilon - |w - y|,\ |w - x|,\ \eta \cdot 2^{-1} \,\}$, a positive real by [L11] since each entry is positive, and use [L6] to fix $p', q' \in \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ with $w - \delta < p' < w < q' < w + \delta$. Then $[p',q'] \subseteq N_\delta(w) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(y) \subseteq (p,q)$ by [L3], the pair $(p',q')$ is good because $w \in (p',q') \cap P$, the point $x$ lies outside $N_\delta(w)$ because $|x - w| \ge \delta$, and $q' - p' < 2\delta \le \eta$. [step 1.3, L1, L3, L4, L6, L11, choose]

3.1 **Successor rule.** For $(k,(p,q)) \in \mathbb{N} \times G$ let $m$ be the least natural for which some natural $n$ makes $(e(m),e(n))$ good with $[e(m),e(n)] \subseteq (p,q)$, $f(k) \notin [e(m),e(n)]$ and $e(n) - e(m) < 1/(k+1)$, and let $n$ be the least natural with those properties for that $m$; put $T(k,(p,q)) := (\sigma(k), (e(m),e(n)))$. The set of eligible $m$ is nonempty by step 2.1 applied with $x = f(k)$ and $\eta = 1/(k+1) > 0$, since $e$ is onto $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, so both minima exist by [L7] and $T : \mathbb{N} \times G \to \mathbb{N} \times G$ is a total function defined without any selection. [step 2.1, L6, L7, L10, construct]

4.1 **The recursion.** $P$ is nonempty, so fix $y_0 \in P$ and, by [L6], elements $p_0 < y_0 < q_0$ of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$; then $(p_0,q_0)$ is good. Apply [L8] with $Y = \mathbb{N} \times G$, seed $(0,(p_0,q_0))$ and map $T$ to get $h : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times G$ with $h(0) = (0,(p_0,q_0))$ and $h(\sigma(k)) = T(h(k))$; an induction on $k$ shows the first coordinate of $h(k)$ is $k$, so write $h(k) = (k,(p_k,q_k))$ with every $(p_k,q_k)$ good. [step 1.3, step 3.1, L6, L8, construct]

5.1 Writing $I_k := [p_k,q_k]$ and $\ell_k := q_k - p_k > 0$, the rule of step 3.1 gives, for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$: $I_{k+1} \subseteq (p_k,q_k) \subseteq I_k$, so the intervals are nested and nonempty; $f(k) \notin I_{k+1}$; $\ell_{k+1} < 1/(k+1)$; and $I_k \cap P \ne \varnothing$, because $(p_k,q_k) \cap P \ne \varnothing$. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L4]

6.1 For every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $k \ge 1$ with $\ell_k < \varepsilon$, and moreover $\ell_k \to 0$: by step 5.1 one has $\ell_j < 1/j$ for every $j \ge 1$, since $\ell_j = \ell_{(j-1)+1} < 1/((j-1)+1) = 1/j$; given $\varepsilon > 0$, [L10] supplies a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$, and then every $k \ge n$ satisfies $k \ge 1$ and $|\ell_k - 0| = \ell_k < 1/k \le 1/n < \varepsilon$ by [L10] and [L13], which is both assertions, the second by [L12] since a rational $\varepsilon > 0$ is in particular a real one. [step 5.1, L10, L12, L13]

7.1 By [L9] the nested family $(I_k)$ of nonempty closed bounded intervals has an intersection that is a single point, since its lengths tend to $0$ by step 6.1; write $\{x\}$ for it, so $x \in I_k$ for every $k$. [step 5.1, step 6.1, L9]

8.1 $x \in P$: let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real and use step 6.1 to fix $k \ge 1$ with $\ell_k < \varepsilon$; by step 5.1 there is $y \in I_k \cap P$, and $x \in I_k$ by step 7.1, so $|y - x| \le \ell_k < \varepsilon$ by [L13] and $y \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap P$. Every neighbourhood of $x$ therefore meets $P$, so $x \in \overline{P} = P$ by [L1] and [L2]. [step 5.1, step 6.1, step 7.1, L1, L2, L3, L13]

9.1 For every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ one has $x \in I_{k+1}$ by step 7.1 while $f(k) \notin I_{k+1}$ by step 5.1, so $x \ne f(k)$; thus the element $x$ of $P$ found in step 8.1 is not a value of $f$, contradicting the surjectivity of the $f$ fixed in step 1.1. The assumption is therefore untenable: a nonempty perfect subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is not at most countable, that is, it is uncountable. [step 1.1, step 5.1, step 7.1, step 8.1, L5, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Which hypothesis does what.** Closedness of $P$ is used exactly once, at the
  step that puts the limit point $x$ back into $P$; without it the construction
  still produces a point, but that point may lie outside $P$ and the
  contradiction evaporates. Having no isolated points is used exactly once, in
  the refinement claim, to produce a second point of $P$ inside a neighbourhood,
  which is what allows the excluded point $f(k)$ to be dodged. Nonemptiness is
  used to seed the recursion, and it cannot be dropped: $\varnothing$ is perfect
  and countable ([[def-perfect-set-r]]).

- **Why rational endpoints.** They are what make the construction canonical.
  The requirement "some good rational-endpoint interval inside $(p,q)$ misses
  $f(k)$ and is short" is a property of a pair of natural numbers, so it can be
  minimised by [[thm-well-ordering-principle]]; the same requirement stated for
  arbitrary real endpoints comes with no canonical least witness, and picking one
  would be a choice made afresh at every stage. This is the same device that
  keeps
  [[lem-subset-of-countable]] and [[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]] choice
  free, transplanted from subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ to intervals.

- **The shrinking condition is $\ell_{k+1} < 1/(k+1)$ and not $1/k$.** Sequences
  and recursions here are indexed from $0$ ([[def-sequence]]), so the bound
  available at stage $k$ has to be positive at $k = 0$; $1/k$ is undefined
  there. The consequence, $\ell_j < 1/j$ for $j \ge 1$, is what step 6.1 uses,
  and it says nothing about $\ell_0$, which is not needed.

- **The result is sharp in both directions.** A nondegenerate closed interval is
  perfect and uncountable ([[ex-closed-interval-is-perfect]]), and deleting the
  no-isolated-points clause loses the conclusion: a closed set with an isolated
  point need not be perfect
  ([[cex-closed-set-with-an-isolated-point-is-not-perfect]]) and may be
  countable, as $\{\, 1/k : k \ge 1 \,\} \cup \{0\}$ is
  ([[ex-reciprocals-with-zero-are-compact]]). Applied to a
  nondegenerate closed interval, which [[ex-closed-interval-is-perfect]] shows
  to be perfect, the theorem reproves the uncountability of intervals
  ([[cor-interval-uncountable]]) by a different route; the two proofs share
  nothing but the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$, which
  [[cor-interval-uncountable]] spends as a supremum and the argument above
  spends through [[thm-nested-interval-property]].
