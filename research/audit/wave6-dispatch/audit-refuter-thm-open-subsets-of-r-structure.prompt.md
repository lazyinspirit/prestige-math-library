You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as a
read-only adversarial proof-refuter for the published-page audit. You are
tool-less: you cannot open a file, run a command, browse, edit, or delegate.
Everything you may rely on is reproduced in the `This dispatch` section. Return
evidence only; Audit-Alpha alone adjudicates and edits.

## Triage — the standing rule (verbatim, binding on you)

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct
  citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

## Adversarial standard

Read the target's title, Statement/Definition/Example/Statement refuted, Facts &
Assumptions, every numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks.
Try to falsify the public claim and every load-bearing inference.

1. Compare every cited fact with the supplied source text before alleging that
   it is weak. Check domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, direction, conclusion,
   and whether the source licenses the exact use.
2. Check that the title and public statement assert no more than the proof
   establishes, and that every proof step uses only available premises.
3. Check both directions of biconditionals, uniqueness/existence claims,
   induction and limiting arguments, empty/zero/endpoint/degenerate cases,
   extended-real conventions, index shifts, and hidden division or choice.
4. Re-read Remarks as skeptically as a numbered step. A false mathematical
   remark is a defect even when the proof is sound.
5. When the target is marked `ai-generated`, actively search for a
   counterexample to its claim, witness, or refutation rather than merely
   checking prose consistency.
6. Treat a false public claim, logically invalid proof, missing necessary
   hypothesis, circularity, or materially inaccurate load-bearing citation as
   fatal. Do not inflate an expository omission or a gap closable within thirty
   seconds into a defect.

## Output format

## Statement

Let $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]). For
$x, y \in \mathbb{R}$ write

$$H(x,y) \;:=\; \{\, z \in \mathbb{R} : x \le z \le y \text{ or } y \le z \le x \,\}$$

for the order-convex hull of the pair, and define a relation on $U$ by

$$x \sim y \quad :\Longleftrightarrow \quad H(x,y) \subseteq U .$$

Then $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $U$. Its equivalence classes, called
the **order components** of $U$, form a family $\mathcal{C}$ with the following
properties:

1. the members of $\mathcal{C}$ are nonempty and pairwise disjoint, and
   $U = \bigcup \mathcal{C}$;
2. every member of $\mathcal{C}$ is an interval of one of the four open forms
   $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$, $(-\infty,\infty)$ of
   [[def-interval]], and is an open set;
3. $\mathcal{C}$ is at most countable ([[def-countable]]).

So every open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is the union of an at most countable family
of pairwise disjoint nonempty open intervals. For $U = \varnothing$ the family
$\mathcal{C}$ is empty and the union of the empty family is $\varnothing$, so the
statement holds in that case too.

**No choice principle is used.** The components are defined by an explicit
equivalence relation, and the enumeration in claim 3 is obtained by sending a
component to the *least* index of a rational lying in it, which is canonical by
[[thm-well-ordering-principle]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An open set $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, the hull $H(x,y)$ and the relation $\sim$ as displayed in the Statement. Write $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the image of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ under the canonical embedding $q \mapsto \hat q$.

[L1] $U$ is open when every $u \in U$ admits a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(u) \subseteq U$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L2] $N_\varepsilon(u) = (u - \varepsilon, u + \varepsilon)$, and $u \in N_\varepsilon(u)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] Order-convexity and the nine interval forms; each of the nine is order-convex, and $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$, $(-\infty,\infty)$ are the open forms; trichotomy and transitivity of the order ([[def-interval]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L4] Least-upper-bound property: a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ bounded above has a least upper bound, unique, and dually a nonempty subset bounded below has a greatest lower bound, unique ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L5] Epsilon characterisations: for nonempty $S$ bounded above and $b = \sup S$, every $\varepsilon > 0$ admits $s \in S$ with $b - \varepsilon < s$; for nonempty $S$ bounded below and $a = \inf S$, every $\varepsilon > 0$ admits $s \in S$ with $s < a + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-sup-epsilon]], [[lem-inf-epsilon]]).

[L6] Bounded above, bounded below, and their negations: $S$ fails to be bounded above exactly when for every $w \in \mathbb{R}$ there is $v \in S$ with $w < v$, and fails to be bounded below exactly when for every $w$ there is $t \in S$ with $t < w$ ([[def-bounded-set]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L7] Strictly between any two reals lies an element of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, and $q \mapsto \hat q$ is injective ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L8] $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-rationals-countable]]); a composition of bijections is a bijection and an injection is a bijection onto its image ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]], [[def-equinumerous]]); every subset of an at most countable set is at most countable ([[lem-subset-of-countable]], [[def-countable]]).

[L9] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 The hull satisfies $x, y \in H(x,y)$, $H(x,y) = H(y,x)$ and $H(x,x) = \{x\}$, and for all $x, y, z$ one has $H(x,z) \subseteq H(x,y) \cup H(y,z)$: given $w \in H(x,z)$, either $x \le w \le z$, in which case $w \le y$ puts $w$ in $H(x,y)$ and $y < w$ puts $w$ in $H(y,z)$, or $z \le w \le x$, in which case $w \le y$ puts $w$ in $H(y,z)$ and $y < w$ puts $w$ in $H(x,y)$. Hence $\sim$ is reflexive on $U$ (as $H(x,x) = \{x\} \subseteq U$), symmetric, and transitive. [given, L3]

1.2 Let $C \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be nonempty, open and order-convex, and let $u \in C$; fix $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(u) \subseteq C$. Then $u - \varepsilon/2$ and $u + \varepsilon/2$ lie in $N_\varepsilon(u) \subseteq C$, so $u$ is neither an upper bound nor a lower bound of $C$. [L1, L2, L3, choose]

1.3 For $x \in U$ put $C_x := \{\, y \in U : H(x,y) \subseteq U \,\}$, the equivalence class of $x$, and let $\mathcal{C} := \{\, C_x : x \in U \,\}$. [construct]

2.1 Each $C_x$ is nonempty because $x \in C_x$; two classes of an equivalence relation are equal or disjoint; and every $x \in U$ lies in $C_x$, so $U = \bigcup \mathcal{C}$. This is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 1.3]

2.2 Each $C_x$ is order-convex: let $u, v \in C_x$ and $u \le w \le v$. From $u \sim x$ and $x \sim v$ we get $u \sim v$, so $H(u,v) \subseteq U$; since $w \in H(u,v)$ we get $w \in U$, and $H(u,w) \subseteq H(u,v) \subseteq U$ because every $t$ with $u \le t \le w$ satisfies $u \le t \le v$, so $u \sim w$ and hence $w \in C_u = C_x$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, L3]

2.3 Each $C_x$ is open: let $u \in C_x \subseteq U$ and fix $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(u) \subseteq U$. For $y \in N_\varepsilon(u)$ the hull $H(u,y)$ is contained in the order-convex set $N_\varepsilon(u)$, hence in $U$, so $u \sim y$ and $y \in C_u = C_x$; therefore $N_\varepsilon(u) \subseteq C_x$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, L1, L2, L3, choose]

2.4 Let $C$ be nonempty, open and order-convex and bounded both above and below; then $a := \inf C$ and $b := \sup C$ exist by [L4]. Every $u \in C$ satisfies $a \le u \le b$, and $u$ is neither an upper nor a lower bound of $C$, so $u \ne a$ and $u \ne b$, giving $a < u < b$; in particular $a < b$ and $C \subseteq (a,b)$. Conversely let $a < w < b$: by [L5] with $\varepsilon = b - w$ there is $v \in C$ with $w < v$, and with $\varepsilon = w - a$ there is $t \in C$ with $t < w$, so $t \le w \le v$ and order-convexity gives $w \in C$. Hence $C = (a,b)$. [step 1.2, L3, L4, L5]

2.5 Let $C$ be nonempty, open and order-convex. If $C$ is bounded below and not above, put $a := \inf C$; as in the bounded case every $u \in C$ satisfies $a < u$, and for $w > a$ the fact [L5] supplies $t \in C$ with $t < w$ while [L6] supplies $v \in C$ with $w < v$, so $w \in C$ by order-convexity; hence $C = (a,\infty)$. Symmetrically, if $C$ is bounded above and not below then $C = (-\infty, b)$ with $b := \sup C$. If $C$ is bounded neither above nor below then for every $w$ the fact [L6] supplies $t, v \in C$ with $t < w < v$, so $w \in C$ and $C = \mathbb{R}$. [step 1.2, L3, L4, L5, L6]

3.1 Every member of $\mathcal{C}$ is nonempty, open and order-convex by steps 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, and it is bounded above or not and bounded below or not, so steps 2.4 and 2.5 exhibit it as an interval of one of the four open forms; this is claim 2. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, step 2.5, L3]

3.2 Every member $C$ of $\mathcal{C}$ contains an element of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$: pick $u \in C$ and, by openness, $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(u) \subseteq C$; since $u - \varepsilon < u + \varepsilon$, the fact [L7] supplies $\hat q$ with $u - \varepsilon < \hat q < u + \varepsilon$, and $N_\varepsilon(u) = (u - \varepsilon, u + \varepsilon)$ by [L2], so $\hat q \in C$. [step 2.1, step 2.3, L2, L7, choose]

4.1 By [L8] fix a bijection $\beta : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$; then $e := \iota \circ \beta$, where $\iota(q) = \hat q$, is a bijection from $\mathbb{N}$ onto $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ by [L7] and [L8]. For $C \in \mathcal{C}$ the set $\{\, n \in \mathbb{N} : e(n) \in C \,\}$ is nonempty by step 3.2, so $\Phi(C) := \min \{\, n \in \mathbb{N} : e(n) \in C \,\}$ is defined by [L9] and no selection is made; and $\Phi$ is injective, since $e(\Phi(C)) \in C$ and distinct members of $\mathcal{C}$ are disjoint by step 2.1. [step 2.1, step 3.2, L7, L8, L9, construct]

5.1 Hence $\mathcal{C}$ is in bijection with $\Phi[\mathcal{C}] \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, and a subset of $\mathbb{N}$ is at most countable, so $\mathcal{C}$ is at most countable; this is claim 3. [step 4.1, L8]

6.1 The family $\mathcal{C}$ constructed in step 1.3 therefore consists of pairwise disjoint nonempty open intervals whose union is $U$, and it is at most countable, which is exactly the assertion. [step 2.1, step 3.1, step 5.1, discharge-construct] ∎

## Remarks

- **The components are forced, not chosen.** A component is an equivalence class
  of an explicitly written relation, so the family $\mathcal{C}$ is determined by
  $U$ alone, with no selection anywhere. One half of the usual uniqueness
  statement is immediate from that: if $U$ is written as a union of nonempty open
  intervals, each of those intervals is order-convex and contained in $U$, so any
  two of its points are equivalent and the whole interval lies inside a single
  component. That the intervals must then *be* the components is the other half,
  and it is neither needed below nor proved here.

- **Where completeness is spent.** Only in steps 2.4 and 2.5, which produce
  $\inf C$ and $\sup C$ from the least-upper-bound property. Everything else
  uses the order alone. The argument therefore does not transpose to an
  arbitrary ordered field, where the two bounds it asks for need not exist; the
  standard obstruction is the set of positive rationals whose square is below
  $2$, which is bounded above in $\mathbb{Q}$ and has no supremum there
  ([[ex-sup-rationals-below-sqrt-two]]).

- **The two sizes in the statement pull in opposite directions.** Each single
  component is an uncountable set, being a nonempty open set
  ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]), while the family of components is at most
  countable. There is no tension: the count in claim 3 is a count of components,
  not of points, and the injection of step 4.1 is into $\mathbb{N}$ through the
  rationals, which are countable and dense at once.

- **This is one of the results whose statement is order vocabulary throughout**,
  and [[rem-r-native-topology-scope]] collects them: interval, disjoint union of
  intervals, and the components themselves are all defined from the order, so
  there is nothing here to restate where no order is present.

For the four bounded forms with\nendpoints $a$ and $b$:\n\n- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \\le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly\n  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\\{a\\}$ when $a = b$.\n- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each\n  is nondegenerate.\n\nThe only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is\nthat $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because\n$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to\nboth sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside\n$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.\n\n**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \\le b$, which is\nexactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested\ninterval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always\ncarries the hypothesis $a \\le b$ in this library.\n\n**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints\n$a \\le b$ is\n\n$$\\ell = b - a \\;\\ge\\; 0 .$$\n\nLength is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the\nset: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is\n$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so\nnothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every\npoint where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.\nUnbounded intervals are assigned no length.",

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ denotes the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a subset of it.

The notions **upper bound** and **bounded above** are already fixed by
[[def-complete-ordered-field]] and are only recalled here, never redefined:
$u \in \mathbb{R}$ is an *upper bound* of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$, and
$S$ is *bounded above* if it has at least one upper bound. The dual notions are:

- $\ell \in \mathbb{R}$ is a **lower bound** of $S$ if $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.
- $S$ is **bounded below** if it has at least one lower bound.
- $S$ is **bounded** if it is both bounded above and bounded below, that is, if
  there are $\ell, u \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\ell \le s \le u$ for every $s \in S$.

## Remarks

- A bound is an element of $\mathbb{R}$ and is not required to lie in $S$. A
  bound that does lie in $S$ is a maximum or a minimum ([[def-max-min]]), and
  that is a strictly stronger condition ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Bounds come in half-lines: if $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$ then so is every
  $\ell'' \le \ell$, and if $u$ is an upper bound then so is every $u'' \ge u$.
  Consequently a set that has one bound of a given kind has infinitely many, and
  the interesting question is whether the collection of them has a best element,
  which is what a supremum ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) or an infimum
  ([[def-infimum]]) is.
- Bounded above and bounded below are independent conditions. The set
  $A = \{\, n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} : n \ge 1 \,\}$ of canonical naturals of
  $\mathbb{R}$ is bounded below by $0$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]) and is not
  bounded above ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); its reflection $-A$ is bounded above
  and not bounded below ([[lem-reflection]]).
- The empty set is bounded, and vacuously so: every real number is both an upper
  bound and a lower bound of $\emptyset$, since the defining condition quantifies
  over no elements. Having bounds is therefore much weaker than having a least
  upper bound or a greatest lower bound ([[fs-every-set-has-sup]]).

## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq F$.

- $u \in F$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$; $S$ is
  **bounded above** if it has an upper bound.
- $u \in F$ is a **least upper bound** (or **supremum**, $\sup S$) of $S$ if $u$
  is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le u'$ for every upper bound $u'$ of $S$.

$F$ is a **complete ordered field** (equivalently, $F$ has the
**least-upper-bound property**, or is **Dedekind complete**) if every nonempty
$S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$.

## Remarks

- A least upper bound, if it exists, is unique (two least upper bounds are each
  $\le$ the other, so equal by antisymmetry of the order).
- Applying the property to $\{-s : s \in S\}$ yields the dual **greatest lower
  bound** (infimum) property, so the two are equivalent.
- The Dedekind-cut reals have this property by construction
  ([[thm-dedekind-complete]]); the Cauchy-sequence reals acquire it via
  [[cor-cauchy-reals-lub-complete]]. This definition is the target for the
  uniqueness theorem [[thm-uniqueness-complete-ordered-field]].

## Definition

Recall that a natural number is a von Neumann natural
([[def-natural-numbers]]): $0 = \varnothing$ and $\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$, so
that

$$n = \{\, m \in \mathbb{N} : m < n \,\} = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$$

is itself the set of its predecessors. Here $<$ is the order of
[[def-nat-order]], which is defined additively, so the displayed identity is a
theorem and not a convention: it is [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]], proved
immediately above. Let $A$ be a set, and let $\approx$ be equinumerosity
([[def-equinumerous]]).

- $A$ is **finite** if $A \approx n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
- $A$ is **countably infinite** if $A \approx \mathbb{N}$.
- $A$ is **at most countable** if it is finite or countably infinite.
- $A$ is **uncountable** if it is not at most countable.

## Remarks

- **Convention: in this library "countable" alone always means "at most
  countable"**, so a finite set is countable. This is the convention of Halmos
  and of Tao, and it is the one that makes the theorems on this page read
  cleanly: subsets, products and unions of countable sets are countable, with no
  finite/infinite case split in the statement. The competing convention, used by
  Rudin among others, reserves "countable" for "countably infinite" and says
  "at most countable" for the disjunction. Under that convention every statement
  below still holds after replacing "countable" with "at most countable", but
  several would become false as literally written. Where the distinction
  matters, the long forms "countably infinite" and "at most countable" are used
  in full, and "uncountable" always means "not at most countable", on which the
  two conventions agree.

- **The three classes are exhaustive by construction**: every set is finite,
  countably infinite, or uncountable, since "uncountable" is defined as the
  negation of the disjunction. That they are also mutually exclusive, that is,
  that no set is both finite and countably infinite, is a genuine theorem
  amounting to $\mathbb{N} \not\approx n$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and it is
  proved immediately above as claim 4 of [[lem-pigeonhole]]. So a countably
  infinite set is never finite, and "$A$ is infinite", meaning not finite, is
  implied by $A \approx \mathbb{N}$. The same lemma pins down finiteness itself:
  by its claim 3 a finite set is equinumerous with exactly one natural number, so
  the number of elements of a finite set is well defined, and by its claim 5 no
  finite set is equinumerous with a proper subset of itself.

- **What the exclusivity is and is not used for below.** Nothing on this page
  needs it in order to run: the infinitude of $\mathbb{Q}$, for instance, is
  obtained by exhibiting a bijection $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ directly
  ([[thm-rationals-countable]]) rather than by ruling out finiteness. It is used
  where the two notions of infinity are compared
  ([[fs-infinite-has-countable-subset-in-zf]]) and where the continuum hypothesis
  is instantiated at $\mathbb{N}$ ([[rem-continuum-hypothesis]]), both of which
  need $\mathbb{N}$ to be infinite as a fact rather than as a convention.

- **$0$ and the empty set.** $0 = \varnothing$, and $A \approx 0$ holds exactly
  when $A = \varnothing$, so the empty set is finite. This matters in the proofs
  below, where the empty case is always separated out: a surjection
  $\mathbb{N} \to A$ cannot exist when $A = \varnothing$, which is why
  [[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]] assumes $A$ nonempty.

- **Countability is a property of a set alone**, not of a set with structure. In
  particular $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable while carrying a dense order, and
  $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable; neither statement says anything on its own about
  the order or the arithmetic those sets carry.

## Definition

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]] for the
terminology).

- $A$ and $B$ are **equinumerous**, written $A \approx B$, if there exists a
  bijection $f : A \to B$.
- $A$ is **dominated by** $B$, written $A \preceq B$, if there exists an
  injection $f : A \to B$.
- $A \prec B$ abbreviates: $A \preceq B$ and not $A \approx B$.

## Remarks

- **$\approx$ behaves like an equivalence relation.** It is reflexive
  ($\mathrm{id}_A$ is a bijection), symmetric (the inverse of a bijection is a
  bijection) and transitive (a composition of bijections is a bijection). The
  careful statement is that these three properties hold for all sets, and that
  $\approx$ restricted to any *set* of sets is an equivalence relation on that
  set. It is not a relation on "the set of all sets", which does not exist; the
  reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity statements are schemas about arbitrary
  sets, which is all any argument below uses.

- **$\preceq$ is reflexive and transitive**, for the same reasons, and
  $A \approx B$ implies both $A \preceq B$ and $B \preceq A$. The converse, that
  $A \preceq B$ and $B \preceq A$ together give $A \approx B$, is a theorem and
  not a triviality: it is [[thm-schroder-bernstein]], and it is proved without
  any use of choice.

- **Subsets.** $A \subseteq B$ implies $A \preceq B$, since the inclusion map is
  injective. The reverse fails badly for infinite sets: the successor map
  $\sigma$ is a bijection $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, being
  injective and never zero ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]) and hitting every
  nonzero natural ([[lem-nat-nonzero-is-successor]]), so
  $\mathbb{N} \approx \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$ and a proper subset can be
  equinumerous with the whole.

- $\approx$ is the library's substitute for "has the same number of elements",
  stated without introducing cardinal numbers. Everything on this page is phrased
  with $\approx$, $\preceq$ and $\prec$ alone, so no theory of cardinals is
  presupposed.

## Definition

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $\ell \in \mathbb{R}$. Then $\ell$ is a
**greatest lower bound**, or **infimum**, of $S$ if both of the following hold:

- $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$ ([[def-bounded-set]]), that is, $\ell \le s$ for
  every $s \in S$;
- $\ell' \le \ell$ for every lower bound $\ell'$ of $S$.

Written out in one line:

$$\ell \text{ is an infimum of } S \iff \big[(\forall s \in S)\, \ell \le s\big] \text{ and } \big[(\forall \ell' \in \mathbb{R})\, \big((\forall s \in S)\, \ell' \le s\big) \Rightarrow \ell' \le \ell\big].$$

An infimum, when it exists, is unique ([[lem-sup-unique]]), so we may write
$\inf S$ for it.

## Remarks

- This is the exact dual of the least upper bound (supremum) of
  [[def-complete-ordered-field]]: reverse every inequality and swap "least" for
  "greatest". The two notions are related by reflection through $0$
  ([[lem-reflection]]).
- Existence is deliberately *not* part of the definition. That every nonempty
  subset of $\mathbb{R}$ which is bounded below actually has an infimum is a
  theorem, [[thm-infimum-property]], derived from the least-upper-bound property;
  it is not an axiom and it is not free.
- As with a supremum, an infimum need not belong to $S$; when it does, it is the
  minimum of $S$ ([[def-max-min]]).
- The usable form of the definition in later arguments is the epsilon
  characterisation [[lem-inf-epsilon]]: $\ell = \inf S$ exactly when $\ell$ is a
  lower bound that cannot be raised by any positive amount without losing that
  property.

## Definition

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets and let $f : A \to B$ be a function ([[def-function]]).

- $f$ is **injective** (one-to-one) if $f(x) = f(y)$ implies $x = y$, for all
  $x, y \in A$.
- $f$ is **surjective** (onto) if for every $b \in B$ there is some $x \in A$
  with $f(x) = b$; equivalently, the image $f[A] := \{ f(x) : x \in A \}$ equals
  $B$.
- $f$ is **bijective** if it is both injective and surjective.

For $S \subseteq A$ we write $f[S] = \{ f(x) : x \in S \}$ for the image of $S$,
and for $T \subseteq B$ we write $f^{-1}[T] = \{ x \in A : f(x) \in T \}$ for the
preimage of $T$; these are the image and preimage of a set under $f$ read as a
relation ([[def-image-and-preimage-under-a-relation]]).

## Remarks

- **Composition.** If $f : A \to B$ and $g : B \to C$ are both injective then so
  is $g \circ f$, since $g(f(x)) = g(f(y))$ forces $f(x) = f(y)$ and then
  $x = y$; if both are surjective then so is $g \circ f$, since any $c \in C$ is
  $g(b)$ for some $b \in B$ and that $b$ is $f(a)$ for some $a \in A$. Hence a
  composition of bijections is a bijection. These verifications, together with the
  two partial converses, are
  [[prop-composition-preserves-injectivity-surjectivity-and-bijectivity]].

- **Inverses.** $f : A \to B$ is bijective exactly when there is a function
  $f^{-1} : B \to A$ with $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ for all $x \in A$ and
  $f(f^{-1}(b)) = b$ for all $b \in B$; that two-sided inverse is unique, and it
  is itself a bijection. Injectivity alone gives a bijection from $A$ onto the
  image $f[A]$, and hence an inverse defined on $f[A]$ only. No choice principle
  is involved: the value $f^{-1}(b)$ is the *unique* $x$ with $f(x) = b$, so it
  is determined rather than selected. The full statement, with the uniqueness of the
  two-sided inverse, is
  [[thm-a-function-is-a-bijection-exactly-when-it-has-a-two-sided-inverse]]; the
  corresponding statement for an arbitrary surjection is not available at this point
  in the reading order, because a right inverse for every surjection is equivalent
  to the Axiom of Choice.

- **What this item does and does not do.** A function $A \to B$ is a set of ordered
  pairs, single valued and total on $A$ ([[def-function]]); ordered pairs, Cartesian
  products, images and preimages are fixed by [[def-ordered-pair]],
  [[def-cartesian-product]] and [[def-image-and-preimage-under-a-relation]]. This
  item only fixes the three adjectives and the notation used for them. Nothing here
  is proved.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]) and its absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]).

Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ with
$\varepsilon > 0$. The **$\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\},$$

and the **punctured $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \;=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}.$$

The two descriptions of $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ agree because $|y - x| = 0$ holds
exactly when $y = x$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**A neighbourhood is an open interval.** For every $x$ and every
$\varepsilon > 0$,

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;=\; (x - \varepsilon,\ x + \varepsilon),$$

the interval of [[def-interval]]. Indeed [[lem-of-abs-value]] gives, for
$\varepsilon > 0$, the equivalence $|y - x| < \varepsilon \iff -\varepsilon <
y - x < \varepsilon$, and adding $x$ throughout turns the right-hand side into
$x - \varepsilon < y < x + \varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**The centre lies in its own neighbourhoods.** $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, since
$|x - x| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**Punctured neighbourhoods are never empty.** The element
$y := x + \varepsilon/2$ satisfies $|y - x| = \varepsilon/2$, which is
$> 0$ and $< \varepsilon$, so $y \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$
([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

**Monotonicity in the radius.** If $0 < \delta \le \varepsilon$ then
$N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, because $|y - x| < \delta \le
\varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**Nesting at an interior point.** If $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and
$0 < \delta \le \varepsilon - |y - x|$, then

$$N_\delta(y) \;\subseteq\; N_\varepsilon(x).$$

Indeed for $z \in N_\delta(y)$ the triangle inequality
([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]) gives
$|z - x| = |(z - y) + (y - x)| \le |z - y| + |y - x| < \delta + |y - x| \le
\varepsilon$. Note that $\varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ precisely because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, so such a $\delta$ always exists.

## Remarks

- **The radius is a real number, not a rational.** Nothing on this page tests a
  condition against rational radii only. That convention belongs to
  [[def-real-limit]], where the quantifier is over rational $\varepsilon$ and
  the passage between the rational and the real form is the sanctioned remark of
  [[def-sequence]]. Here $\varepsilon$ ranges over the positive reals
  throughout, and every statement above is proved for an arbitrary positive
  real.

- **Why the punctured version is separated out.** A limit point of a set is a
  point every punctured neighbourhood of which meets the set
  ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and deleting the centre is exactly what stops a point
  of the set from qualifying automatically. The unpunctured condition defines
  the weaker notion of an adherent point, and the difference between the two is
  precisely an isolated point.

- **Nesting is the workhorse.** Almost every openness verification on this page
  has the shape "given $y$ in the set, shrink the radius by the distance
  already travelled", which is the nesting property above. It is recorded here
  once so that no later proof has to redo the triangle inequality in passing.

## Definition

Let $U, F \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]].

- $U$ is **open** when for every $x \in U$ there is a real $\varepsilon > 0$
  with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$.
- $F$ is **closed** when its complement $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open.
- A set is **clopen** when it is both open and closed.

The whole of the topology of $\mathbb{R}$ developed on this page rests on this
one definition: closedness is *defined* as openness of the complement, and every
other description of a closed set on this page is a theorem
([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]]).

**$\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen.** The condition defining openness
quantifies over the elements of the set, so it holds vacuously for
$\varnothing$; and for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ one has $N_1(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$,
so $\mathbb{R}$ is open. Since each of the two is the complement of the other,
each is also closed.

**Every neighbourhood is open.** Let $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and put
$\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x|$, which is $> 0$ because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$. The nesting property of [[def-neighbourhood-r]] gives
$N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$. So every point of $N_\varepsilon(x)$
has a neighbourhood inside it.

**The four open forms of [[def-interval]] are open sets.** Let $a, b \in
\mathbb{R}$.

- $(a,b)$: for $x$ with $a < x < b$, both $x - a > 0$ and $b - x > 0$, so
  $\delta := \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ is a positive real (the minimum of a
  two-element set of reals exists, [[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).
  If $|y - x| < \delta$ then $y > x - \delta \ge x - (x - a) = a$ and
  $y < x + \delta \le x + (b - x) = b$, so $y \in (a,b)$; hence
  $N_\delta(x) \subseteq (a,b)$.
- $(a,\infty)$: for $x > a$ take $\delta := x - a > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y > x - \delta = a$.
- $(-\infty,b)$: for $x < b$ take $\delta := b - x > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y < x + \delta = b$.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: already treated above.

**The four closed forms of [[def-interval]] are closed sets.** In each case the
complement is shown open directly.

- $[a,b]$: if $x \notin [a,b]$ then $x < a$ or $x > b$ by trichotomy
  ([[def-ordered-field]]). If $x < a$, take $\delta := a - x > 0$; every
  $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has $y < x + \delta = a$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. If
  $x > b$, take $\delta := x - b > 0$; every $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has
  $y > x - \delta = b$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. So
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus [a,b]$ is open.
- $[a,\infty)$: its complement is $(-\infty,a)$, which is open by the previous
  paragraph.
- $(-\infty,b]$: its complement is $(b,\infty)$, which is open.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: its complement is $\varnothing$, which is
  open.

## Remarks

- **Open and closed are not opposites, and not exhaustive.** A set may be
  neither: the half-open interval $[0,1)$ is neither open nor closed
  ([[fs-every-set-is-open-or-closed]]). A set may be both: $\varnothing$ and
  $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen. The words are inherited from the interval terminology
  of [[def-interval]], and the agreement between the two usages is exactly the
  two lists verified above: an interval called open there is an open set here,
  and an interval called closed there is a closed set here.

- **A clopen set is a disconnection waiting to happen.** If $A$ is clopen and
  both $A$ and $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ are nonempty, then each of the two is
  its own closure, so the two are separated in the sense of
  [[def-connected-r]] and $\mathbb{R} = A \cup (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)$ is a
  disconnection. Since $\mathbb{R}$ is order-convex it is connected
  ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]]), so no such $A$ exists:
  $\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are the only clopen subsets of $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The half-open forms are the ones the two lists omit**, and deliberately so:
  $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ with $a < b$ are neither open nor closed as subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The radius depends on the point.** Openness asks for *some* $\varepsilon$
  at each point, and that $\varepsilon$ may shrink to nothing as the point
  approaches the edge of the set, as the computation for $(a,b)$ shows: there
  $\delta = \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ tends to $0$ as $x$ tends to either endpoint.
  Asking instead for a single $\varepsilon$ that works simultaneously at every
  point of the set is a strictly stronger condition, and it is not what is
  defined here; nothing on this page uses it.

## Definition

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ ([[def-field]]) together with a subset
$P \subseteq F$, the set of **positive** elements (the *positive cone*),
satisfying:

- **(O1) Trichotomy.** For each $x \in F$, exactly one of the following holds:
  $x \in P$, or $x = 0$, or $-x \in P$.
- **(O2) Closure.** If $x, y \in P$ then $x + y \in P$ and $x \cdot y \in P$.

We write $x > 0$ for $x \in P$ (read "$x$ is positive"), and define the order by

$$a < b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; b - a \in P, \qquad a \le b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; a < b \text{ or } a = b.$$

Thus $a > b$ means $b < a$, and $a \ge b$ means $b \le a$. An element $x$ with
$-x \in P$ (equivalently $x < 0$) is called **negative**.

## Remarks

- By trichotomy applied to $b - a$, for any $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$,
  $a = b$, $a > b$ holds; this makes $\le$ a total order.
- (O2) says the positives are closed under addition and multiplication: sums and
  products of positives are positive.
- The rationals ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and both constructions of the reals
  ([[thm-reals-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-dedekind-ordered-field]]) are ordered
  fields, so every fact proved here from (O1)-(O2) holds in each of them.

## Example

Let $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$ be the canonical embedding of the
rationals as an ordered subfield of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]) and put
$$S = \{\, q \in \mathbb{Q} \ : \ q > 0 \text{ and } q^2 < 2 \,\}.$$
Viewed inside $\mathbb{R}$, the set $S$ has a supremum, namely
$\sup S = \sqrt{2}$, the unique nonnegative real whose square is $2$
([[thm-of-square-roots]]). Viewed inside $\mathbb{Q}$, the same set has **no**
supremum at all: it has upper bounds in $\mathbb{Q}$, but none of them is least.

This is the reason $\mathbb{R}$ exists. The rationals form an ordered field in
which a perfectly ordinary bounded set fails to have a least upper bound, because
the number that ought to be that bound is irrational ([[fs-sqrt2-rational]]). The
least-upper-bound property ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) is precisely the
repair, and the value it supplies here is $\sqrt{2}$.

The order-theoretic defect exhibited below is the exact counterpart of the metric
defect recorded in [[fs-rationals-complete]], where a Cauchy sequence of rationals
fails to have a rational limit. The two are different statements about the same
hole in $\mathbb{Q}$, and this library repairs it twice, once by Dedekind cuts
and once by Cauchy sequences.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The complete ordered field $\mathbb{R}$, the canonical embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$, the abbreviation $2 := 1 + 1$ in each of the two fields, and the set $S := \{\, q \in \mathbb{Q} : q > 0 \text{ and } q^2 < 2 \,\}$, regarded as a subset of $\mathbb{Q}$ and, through $\iota$, as the subset $\iota(S)$ of $\mathbb{R}$. "Upper bound of $S$ in $\mathbb{Q}$" means an element $u \in \mathbb{Q}$ with $q \le u$ for every $q \in S$, and "supremum of $S$ in $\mathbb{Q}$" means such a $u$ that is $\le$ every upper bound of $S$ in $\mathbb{Q}$.

[L1] Square roots: every $a \ge 0$ in $\mathbb{R}$ has a unique $s \ge 0$ with $s^2 = a$ ([[thm-of-square-roots]]).

[L2] Squaring is strictly monotone on the nonnegatives: for $a, b \ge 0$ in $\mathbb{R}$ one has $a < b$ if and only if $a^2 < b^2$ ([[lem-of-square-monotone]]).

[L3] The embedding: $\iota$ is the unique field homomorphism $\mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$; it is injective and order preserving, so $\iota(q + r) = \iota(q) + \iota(r)$, $\iota(qr) = \iota(q)\iota(r)$, $\iota(1) = 1$ and $q < r$ implies $\iota(q) < \iota(r)$. It also reflects the order: if $\iota(q) < \iota(r)$ then $q < r$, since $r \le q$ would give $\iota(r) \le \iota(q)$ by order preservation and injectivity, contradicting trichotomy ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L4] Density: $\mathbb{R}$ is Archimedean, being a complete ordered field, and its rationals are dense in it, so for $x < y$ in $\mathbb{R}$ there is $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ with $x < \iota(q) < y$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-archimedean-field]], [[lem-of-q-dense]]).

[L5] The claim that there exists $x \in \mathbb{Q}$ with $x^2 = 2$ is false ([[fs-sqrt2-rational]]).

[L6] Epsilon characterisation of the supremum: for a nonempty $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ bounded above and an upper bound $w$ of $X$, one has $w = \sup X$ if and only if for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $x \in X$ with $w - \varepsilon < x$ ([[lem-sup-epsilon]]).

[L7] Every set $\{a, b\}$ of two reals has a maximum, which is one of the two entries and dominates both ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L8] Order and least upper bounds: $0 < 1$, hence $2 = 1 + 1 > 1 > 0$ in both fields; trichotomy holds, so the negation of $a \le b$ is $b < a$; the order is transitive; adding a constant preserves it; multiplication distributes over addition, so $2 \cdot 2 = 2 + 2$; $0 \cdot a = 0$ for every $a$, so $0^2 = 0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]); and a least upper bound is an upper bound that is $\le$ every upper bound ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]).

## Verification

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 In $\mathbb{R}$ we have $2 = 1 + 1 > 0$, so [L1] supplies a unique $r \ge 0$ with $r^2 = 2$; and $r \ne 0$ because $r = 0$ would give $r^2 = 0 \ne 2$, so $r > 0$. Write $r =: \sqrt{2}$. [L1, L8, choose]

1.2 $S$ is nonempty: the rational $1$ satisfies $1 > 0$ and $1^2 = 1 < 2$, so $1 \in S$. [L8]

1.3 Let $u \in \mathbb{Q}$ be an arbitrary upper bound of $S$ in $\mathbb{Q}$, that is, $q \le u$ for every $q \in S$. [assume-hyp]

1.4 Let $\varepsilon > 0$ in $\mathbb{R}$ be arbitrary. [assume-hyp]

1.5 The rational $2$ is an upper bound of $S$ in $\mathbb{Q}$, so $S$ is bounded above there: for $q \in S$ order preservation gives $\iota(q) > 0$ and $\iota(q)^2 = \iota(q^2) < \iota(2) = 2 < 2 + 2 = 2 \cdot 2 = \iota(2)^2$, whence $\iota(q) < \iota(2)$ by [L2] and $q < 2$ by order reflection. [L2, L3, L8]

2.1 $r$ is an upper bound of $\iota(S)$ in $\mathbb{R}$: for $q \in S$ order preservation gives $\iota(q) > 0$ and $\iota(q)^2 = \iota(q^2) < \iota(2) = 2 = r^2$, so $\iota(q) < r$ by [L2], hence $\iota(q) \le r$. [step 1.1, L2, L3, L8]

2.2 $r$ is not the image of any rational: if $r = \iota(q)$ then $\iota(q^2) = \iota(q)^2 = r^2 = 2 = \iota(2)$, so $q^2 = 2$ by injectivity of $\iota$, which [L5] forbids. [step 1.1, L3, L5]

2.3 Put $a_\varepsilon := \max\{0,\ r - \varepsilon\}$, which exists by [L7]; then $0 \le a_\varepsilon$, and $a_\varepsilon < r$ because $a_\varepsilon$ is one of the two entries $0$ and $r - \varepsilon$, of which the first is $< r$ by 1.1 and the second is $< r$ because $\varepsilon > 0$. [step 1.1, step 1.4, L7, L8, choose]

2.4 The image $\iota(u)$ of the bound $u$ is an upper bound of $\iota(S)$ in $\mathbb{R}$: for $q \in S$ the inequality $q \le u$ in $\mathbb{Q}$ gives $\iota(q) \le \iota(u)$ by order preservation. [step 1.3, L3]

3.1 Density applied to $a_\varepsilon < r$ produces a rational $q_\varepsilon$ with $a_\varepsilon < \iota(q_\varepsilon) < r$; then $\iota(q_\varepsilon) > a_\varepsilon \ge 0$ forces $q_\varepsilon > 0$ by order reflection, and $0 \le \iota(q_\varepsilon) < r$ gives $\iota(q_\varepsilon^2) = \iota(q_\varepsilon)^2 < r^2 = 2 = \iota(2)$ by [L2], hence $q_\varepsilon^2 < 2$ in $\mathbb{Q}$; so $q_\varepsilon \in S$ and $r - \varepsilon \le a_\varepsilon < \iota(q_\varepsilon)$. [step 2.3, step 1.1, L4, L2, L3]

4.1 The set $\iota(S)$ is nonempty and bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$ by $r$, and for every $\varepsilon > 0$ its element $\iota(q_\varepsilon)$ satisfies $r - \varepsilon < \iota(q_\varepsilon)$; the epsilon characterisation therefore gives $\sup \iota(S) = r = \sqrt{2}$. [step 1.2, step 2.1, step 3.1, L6]

5.1 Since $r$ is the least upper bound of $\iota(S)$ and $\iota(u)$ is an upper bound of it, we get $r \le \iota(u)$; and $r \ne \iota(u)$ by 2.2, so $r < \iota(u)$. [step 4.1, step 2.4, step 2.2, L8]

6.1 Density applied to $r < \iota(u)$ produces a rational $v$ with $r < \iota(v) < \iota(u)$; every $q \in S$ satisfies $\iota(q) \le r < \iota(v)$, so $q < v$ by order reflection and $v$ is an upper bound of $S$ in $\mathbb{Q}$; and $v < u$, again by order reflection. Hence $u$ is not $\le$ every upper bound of $S$ in $\mathbb{Q}$, so $u$ is not a supremum of $S$ in $\mathbb{Q}$. [step 5.1, step 2.1, L4, L3, L8]

7.1 The upper bound $u$ was an arbitrary one, so no upper bound of $S$ in $\mathbb{Q}$ is least: $S$ has a supremum in $\mathbb{R}$, equal to $\sqrt{2}$, and has no supremum in $\mathbb{Q}$ even though it is nonempty and bounded above there, for instance by $2$. [step 6.1, step 4.1, step 1.5, L8] ∎

## Remarks

- The set $S$ is bounded above in $\mathbb{Q}$, by $2$, as step 1.5 checks. Both hypotheses of the least-upper-bound property are therefore satisfied *inside* $\mathbb{Q}$, and the conclusion still fails. The property is a genuine assumption about the field, not a consequence of the order axioms alone.
- The proof of leastness uses density twice, once to find an element of $S$ close below $\sqrt{2}$ and once to squeeze a rational between $\sqrt{2}$ and a putative rational least upper bound. Both uses go through [[lem-of-q-dense]], which is itself a consequence of the Archimedean property ([[thm-of-archimedean]]).
- The same argument runs with $2$ replaced by any positive rational $c$ that is not the square of a rational, once its two numerical steps are readjusted: step 1.2 must exhibit a positive rational whose square lies below $c$, and step 1.5 a positive rational whose square lies above it, neither of which is the constant $1$ or $2$ in general. Both exist for every positive rational $c$, and uniformly, so nothing here depends on $c$ being convenient: take $p := c/(1+c)$ and $w := 1 + c$, both positive rationals. Then $p^2 < c$, since $p^2 < c$ is equivalent to $c^2 < c(1+c)^2$ and hence, dividing by $c > 0$, to $c < (1+c)^2 = 1 + 2c + c^2$, which holds because $1 + c + c^2 > 0$; and $w^2 = 1 + 2c + c^2 > c$ for the same reason. Everything after those two steps is unchanged, so the failure is pervasive rather than a curiosity attached to $\sqrt{2}$.

## Statement

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be nonempty and bounded below, and let $\ell$ be a
lower bound of $S$ ([[def-bounded-set]]). Then

$$\ell = \inf S \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \text{for every } \varepsilon > 0 \text{ there exists } s \in S \text{ with } s < \ell + \varepsilon.$$

In words: among the lower bounds of $S$, the infimum is exactly the one that
cannot be raised by any positive amount and still bound $S$ from below.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A nonempty $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ that is bounded below, a lower bound $\ell$ of $S$, and the reflection $T := -S = \{-s : s \in S\}$.

[L1] Reflection, at the level of sets: $S$ is nonempty exactly when $T$ is; $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$ exactly when $-\ell$ is an upper bound of $T$; and $S$ is bounded below exactly when $T$ is bounded above ([[lem-reflection]]). Elementwise, negation reverses the order: $-(-a) = a$, because $(-a) + a = 0$ and additive inverses are unique ([[def-field]], [[lem-of-inverse-unique]]); and $a < b$ exactly when $-b < -a$, because translation invariance applied with the constant $-a - b$ turns $a < b$ into $-b < -a$ and, applied with the constant $a + b$, turns it back ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

[L2] Every nonempty $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ bounded below has an infimum, and $\inf S = -\sup(-S) = -\sup T$ ([[thm-infimum-property]]).

[L3] Epsilon characterisation of the supremum: for a nonempty $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ bounded above and an upper bound $v$ of $X$, one has $v = \sup X$ if and only if for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $x \in X$ with $v - \varepsilon < x$ ([[lem-sup-epsilon]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Since $S$ is nonempty and bounded below and $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$, the set $T$ is nonempty and $-\ell$ is an upper bound of $T$, so $T$ is nonempty and bounded above. [given, L1]

1.2 For $s \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\varepsilon > 0$, negation turns the inequality $(-\ell) - \varepsilon < -s$ into $s < \ell + \varepsilon$ and back, because $-(-s) = s$ and $-\big((-\ell) - \varepsilon\big) = \ell + \varepsilon$. [L1, algebra]

2.1 By [L2] the infimum of $S$ exists and equals $-\sup T$; hence $\ell = \inf S$ holds if and only if $\ell = -\sup T$, which by negating both sides holds if and only if $-\ell = \sup T$. [step 1.1, L2, L1]

3.1 Applying [L3] to the nonempty bounded-above set $T$ and its upper bound $-\ell$: $-\ell = \sup T$ if and only if for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $t \in T$ with $(-\ell) - \varepsilon < t$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L3]

4.1 The elements of $T$ are exactly the $-s$ with $s \in S$, so by 1.2 the condition "there is $t \in T$ with $(-\ell) - \varepsilon < t$" is equivalent to "there is $s \in S$ with $s < \ell + \varepsilon$". [step 1.2, step 3.1, L1]

5.1 Chaining the equivalences, $\ell = \inf S$ if and only if for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $s \in S$ with $s < \ell + \varepsilon$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, step 4.1] ∎

## Statement

Write $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the image of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$
under the canonical embedding $q \mapsto \hat q$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), the
set usually written $\mathbb{Q}$ once the identification is made, and put
$X := \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the irrationals. Then:

1. $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$, that is,
   $\overline{\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}} = \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]);
2. $X$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$;
3. every nonempty open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable
   ([[def-countable]]).

Claim 2 is not a symmetry of claim 1: the rationals are dense because they are
*constructed* to approximate, whereas the irrationals are dense because there are
too many points in any interval for a countable set to exhaust it, which is why
claim 3 is proved alongside and used for it.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The canonical embedding $q \mapsto \hat q$ of $\mathbb{Q}$ into $\mathbb{R}$, its image $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, and the complement $X = \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$.

[L1] $\overline{A}$ is the set of points every neighbourhood of which meets $A$; $A$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ when $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L2] $N_\varepsilon(x) = (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon)$ for real $\varepsilon > 0$, and $x - \varepsilon < x + \varepsilon$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L3] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L4] Strictly between any two reals lies an element of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, and $q \mapsto \hat q$ is injective ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L5] $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-rationals-countable]]); an injection is a bijection onto its image, and $\approx$ is symmetric and transitive ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]], [[def-equinumerous]]).

[L6] Every subset of an at most countable set is at most countable, and uncountable means not at most countable ([[lem-subset-of-countable]], [[def-countable]]).

[L7] For $a < b$ the interval $(a,b)$ is uncountable ([[cor-interval-uncountable]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is dense: let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real; by [L2] one has $x - \varepsilon < x + \varepsilon$, so [L4] supplies $\hat q$ with $x - \varepsilon < \hat q < x + \varepsilon$, that is $\hat q \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$. Every real is therefore an adherent point of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and claim 1 follows from [L1]. [L1, L2, L4]

1.2 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is at most countable: the embedding is an injection of $\mathbb{Q}$ with image $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, hence a bijection onto it, so $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \approx \mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$. [L4, L5]

1.3 For all reals $a < b$ the interval $(a,b)$ is uncountable. [L7]

2.1 For all reals $a < b$ the interval $(a,b)$ contains an irrational: if it did not, then $(a,b) \subseteq \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, so $(a,b)$ would be a subset of an at most countable set by step 1.2 and hence at most countable by [L6], contradicting step 1.3. So some $z \in (a,b)$ lies in $X$. [step 1.2, step 1.3, L6]

2.2 Every nonempty open $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is uncountable: fix $x \in U$ and, by [L3], a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; by [L2] the set $N_\varepsilon(x)$ is the interval $(x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon)$ with $x - \varepsilon < x + \varepsilon$, hence uncountable by step 1.3. Were $U$ at most countable, its subset $N_\varepsilon(x)$ would be at most countable by [L6], which it is not; so $U$ is uncountable, which is claim 3. [step 1.3, L2, L3, L6, choose]

3.1 $X$ is dense: let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real; applying step 2.1 with $a = x - \varepsilon$ and $b = x + \varepsilon$ gives $z \in (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon) \cap X$, which is $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap X$ by [L2]. Every real is therefore an adherent point of $X$, so $\overline{X} = \mathbb{R}$ by [L1], which is claim 2. [step 2.1, L1, L2]

4.1 Claims 1, 2 and 3 are steps 1.1, 3.1 and 2.2, so both $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and its complement are dense in $\mathbb{R}$ and every nonempty open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable. [step 1.1, step 2.2, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Two dense sets can be disjoint.** $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and $X$ partition
  $\mathbb{R}$ and both are dense, so density says nothing about size: one of
  them is countable and the other is not
  ([[cor-irrationals-uncountable]]). What density does say is that neither has
  interior: a set whose complement is dense has empty interior, which is the
  computation carried out for $\mathbb{Q}$ in
  [[ex-closure-interior-boundary-of-q]].

- **Claim 3 is a statement about open sets, not about intervals.** It follows
  from the uncountability of intervals ([[cor-interval-uncountable]]) only
  because openness supplies an interval inside the set at each of its points.
  A nonempty set with empty interior can perfectly well be countable, as
  $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ shows.

- **An explicit irrational is not produced here.** Step 2.1 is a counting
  argument and exhibits nothing. The library does exhibit one separately,
  $\sqrt 2$ ([[thm-of-square-roots]], [[fs-sqrt2-rational]]), and an explicit
  irrational in a given interval $(a,b)$ can be built from it as
  $q_1 + (q_2 - q_1)/\sqrt 2$ for suitable rationals $q_1 < q_2$ in the
  interval; that route is longer and is not the one taken above.

## Statement

The map $q \mapsto \hat q$ ([[def-real-numbers]]) is an embedding of ordered
fields. Every real is approximated by rationals: for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and
rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ with
$|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$. Consequently, strictly between any two
reals lies a rational.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real $x = [(a_n)]$ and a rational $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] The orders of $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}$; ordered-field arithmetic ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Field arithmetic in $\mathbb{Q}$: $\varepsilon/2, \delta/4$ are positive rationals, and every nonzero rational $q$ has a reciprocal $1/q$ with $q \cdot (1/q) = 1$ ([[thm-rat-field]]).

[L3] Cauchy definition ([[def-rational-cauchy-sequence]]).

[L4] Real positivity via eventual rational lower bounds ([[def-real-order]]).

[L5] $\mathbb{R} = \mathcal{C}/\mathcal{N}$ is a field ([[thm-reals-field]]), and $0_{\mathbb{R}} = \hat 0$, $1_{\mathbb{R}} = \hat 1$ are the classes of the constant sequences ([[def-real-numbers]]). A multiplicative inverse there is unique: if $ab = 1_{\mathbb{R}} = ac$ then $b = b(ac) = (ba)c = c$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Embedding: constant sequences are Cauchy; $\hat q = \hat r$ iff the constant $q - r$ is null iff $q = r$; operations match termwise; and $q < r$ gives the constant lower bound $r - q > 0$, so $\hat q < \hat r$ and order is preserved and reflected. [L1, L4]

1.2 Fix $N$ with $|a_m - a_n| < \varepsilon/2$ for all $m, n \ge N$, and set $q = a_N$. [L3, L2]

2.1 The difference $\hat q - x$ has representative $(a_N - a_n)$ with $|a_N - a_n| < \varepsilon/2$ for $n \ge N$; hence both $\hat\varepsilon - (x - \hat q)$ and $\hat\varepsilon - (\hat q - x)$ have representatives eventually $> \varepsilon/2$, so both are positive: $|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$. [step 1.2, L4, L1]

2.2 Inverses: let $q$ be a nonzero rational. Then $\hat q \ne \hat 0 = 0_{\mathbb{R}}$ by the injectivity of step 1.1, and $1/q$ exists in $\mathbb{Q}$ by [L2]; since the operations match termwise (step 1.1), $\hat q \cdot \widehat{1/q} = \widehat{q \cdot (1/q)} = \hat 1 = 1_{\mathbb{R}}$. Inverses in $\mathbb{R}$ are unique by [L5], so $(\hat q)^{-1} = \widehat{1/q}$: the embedding preserves reciprocals. [step 1.1, L2, L5]

3.1 Density: let $x < y$; pick $\delta > 0$ rational and $N$ with the representative of $y - x$ eventually $> \delta$; set $\varepsilon = \delta/4$ and pick $q$ with $|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$; then $q' = q + 2\varepsilon$ satisfies $\hat q' - x \ge -\hat\varepsilon + 2\hat\varepsilon = \hat\varepsilon > 0$ and $y - \hat q' \ge \hat\delta - \hat\varepsilon - 2\hat\varepsilon = \hat\delta/4 > 0$, so $x < \hat q' < y$. [step 2.1, L4, L1, L2]

4.1 The rationals embed as an ordered subfield — injectively, preserving the order in both directions, the ring operations, and reciprocals — and they approximate every real arbitrarily well and separate any two reals. [step 1.1, step 2.2, step 3.1] ∎

## Statement

Let $A$ be at most countable ([[def-countable]]) and let $B \subseteq A$. Then
$B$ is at most countable.

The proof establishes the sharper statement about subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ from
which this follows: **a subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is finite if it is
bounded above, and countably infinite if it is not.**

**No choice principle is used.** This is the point of the lemma rather than a
footnote to it. The enumeration of an unbounded $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is built
by always taking the *least* element of $S$ above the previous one, and the least
element of a nonempty set of naturals is canonical
([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]): it is determined by $S$, not selected from it.
Replacing "least" by "some" would turn the construction into an appeal to
dependent choice.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An at most countable set $A$ and a subset $B \subseteq A$. Throughout, a natural number is the von Neumann natural, so that $0 = \varnothing$ and $\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]); that $n = \{\, m \in \mathbb{N} : m < n \,\}$, and in particular that every element of a natural number is a natural number, is [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]], proved earlier on this page from the additive order of [[def-nat-order]].

[L1] $A$ is finite when $A \approx n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$, countably infinite when $A \approx \mathbb{N}$, and at most countable when one of the two holds ([[def-countable]]).

[L2] $\approx$ is symmetric and transitive, an injection is a bijection onto its image, and the restriction of a bijection to a subset is a bijection onto the image of that subset ([[def-equinumerous]], [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L3] Well-ordering: every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L4] Strong induction: if for every $n$ the truth of $P(m)$ for all $m < n$ implies $P(n)$, then $P(n)$ holds for every $n$ ([[thm-strong-induction]]).

[L5] Recursion: for any set $X$, any $x_0 \in X$ and any $F : X \to X$ there is a function $h : \mathbb{N} \to X$ with $h(0) = x_0$ and $h(\sigma(n)) = F(h(n))$ ([[thm-recursion]]).

[L6] Order facts in $\mathbb{N}$: $m \in n \iff m < n$, $m \le n \iff m \subseteq n$, $n < \sigma(n)$, and $m < \sigma(n) \iff m \le n$ ([[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]); exactly one of $m < n$, $m = n$, $n < m$ holds, so $<$ is irreflexive and any two naturals are comparable ([[lem-nat-trichotomy]]); $\le$ is reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive and total ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]), whence $<$ is transitive, because $m < n < p$ gives $m \le p$ while $m = p$ would force $m = n$ by antisymmetry; $m < n \iff \sigma(m) \le n$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]).

[L7] Every nonzero natural is a successor ([[lem-nat-nonzero-is-successor]]).

[L8] Membership is irreflexive on $\mathbb{N}$: $k \notin k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, and every natural number is a transitive set ([[lem-nat-transitive-irreflexive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Since $A$ is at most countable there is a bijection $\varphi : A \to N_0$ where $N_0 = n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ or $N_0 = \mathbb{N}$; in either case $N_0 \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, and restricting $\varphi$ to $B$ gives a bijection of $B$ onto $S := \varphi[B] \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, so $B \approx S$. It therefore suffices to prove that every subset of $\mathbb{N}$ is at most countable, since then $S \approx n'$ or $S \approx \mathbb{N}$ and transitivity carries the conclusion back to $B$. [given, L1, L2, L6, suffices: every subset of N is at most countable]

1.2 Every subset of a natural number is finite: by strong induction on $n$, assume every subset of every $m < n$ is finite. If $n = 0$ then a subset $T \subseteq 0 = \varnothing$ is empty and $T \approx 0$. Otherwise $n = \sigma(m)$ by [L7], with $m < n$; given $T \subseteq \sigma(m) = m \cup \{m\}$, the set $T \setminus \{m\}$ is a subset of $m$, so the hypothesis at $m$ gives a bijection $u : T \setminus \{m\} \to k$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$. If $m \notin T$ then $T = T \setminus \{m\} \approx k$. If $m \in T$, extend $u$ by $u(m) := k$; since $k \notin k$ by irreflexivity of membership, the value $k$ is not already taken and the extension is a bijection $T \to k \cup \{k\} = \sigma(k)$. In both cases $T$ is finite, so the claim holds for $n$ and hence for all $n$. [L1, L2, L4, L6, L7, L8]

1.3 Case $S$ bounded: assume there is $b_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ with $s \le b_0$ for every $s \in S$. Then $s < \sigma(b_0)$ for every $s \in S$ by [L6], that is, $S \subseteq \sigma(b_0)$. [assume-case bounded, L6]

1.4 Case $S$ unbounded: assume that for every $b \in \mathbb{N}$ there is $s \in S$ with $b < s$. Then $S \ne \varnothing$, and for each $s \in S$ the set $\{\, t \in S : s < t \,\}$ is nonempty, so [L3] makes $\nu(s) := \min \{\, t \in S : s < t \,\}$ a well-defined element of $S$ with $s < \nu(s)$; this defines a function $\nu : S \to S$ with no arbitrary choices. [assume-case unbounded, L3, construct]

2.1 In the bounded case $S$ is a subset of the natural number $\sigma(b_0)$, hence finite by step 1.2, hence at most countable. [step 1.2, step 1.3, L1]

2.2 In the unbounded case apply [L5] with $X = S$, $x_0 = \min S$ (available by [L3] since $S \ne \varnothing$) and $F = \nu$: there is $e : \mathbb{N} \to S$ with $e(0) = \min S$ and $e(\sigma(n)) = \nu(e(n)) = \min \{\, t \in S : e(n) < t \,\}$ for every $n$. [step 1.4, L3, L5, construct]

3.1 For every $n$, $e(n) < e(\sigma(n))$ by the defining property of $\nu$; consequently $m < n$ implies $e(m) < e(n)$, by strong induction on $n$ (for $n = \sigma(j)$ and $m < n$ one has $m \le j$ by [L6], so either $m = j$, giving $e(m) < e(\sigma(j))$ directly, or $m < j$, giving $e(m) < e(j) < e(\sigma(j))$ by the hypothesis at $j$ and transitivity). Hence $e$ is injective: if $m \ne n$ then $m < n$ or $n < m$ by comparability, and irreflexivity forbids $e(m) = e(n)$. [step 2.2, L4, L6, L7]

3.2 For every $k$, $k \le e(k)$: again by strong induction, at $k = 0$ this is immediate, and for $k = \sigma(j)$ the hypothesis at $j$ gives $j \le e(j) < e(\sigma(j))$, so $j < e(k)$ and therefore $\sigma(j) \le e(k)$ by [L6], that is $k \le e(k)$. [step 2.2, L4, L6, L7]

4.1 $e$ is surjective onto $S$: let $t \in S$. The set $K = \{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : t \le e(k) \,\}$ contains $t$ by step 3.2, so $k^\ast := \min K$ exists by [L3]. If $k^\ast = 0$ then $e(0) = \min S \le t$ because $t \in S$, and $t \le e(0)$, so $e(0) = t$. Otherwise $k^\ast = \sigma(j)$ by [L7], and $j \notin K$ by minimality, so $e(j) < t$; then $t$ belongs to $\{\, u \in S : e(j) < u \,\}$, whence $e(k^\ast) = \min \{\, u \in S : e(j) < u \,\} \le t$, and with $t \le e(k^\ast)$ this gives $e(k^\ast) = t$. In both cases $t$ is a value of $e$. [step 2.2, step 3.2, L3, L6, L7]

5.1 In the unbounded case $e : \mathbb{N} \to S$ is therefore a bijection, so $S \approx \mathbb{N}$ and $S$ is countably infinite, hence at most countable. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L1, L2]

6.1 Every $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is either bounded above or not, so steps 2.1 and 5.1 cover all cases and every subset of $\mathbb{N}$ is at most countable; by the reduction of step 1.1 the subset $B$ of the at most countable set $A$ is at most countable. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 5.1, cases-exhaustive, L1, L2] ∎

## Remarks

- A subset of a countably infinite set may perfectly well be finite: $\{0, 1\}$ and $\varnothing$ are subsets of $\mathbb{N}$. This is exactly why the conclusion is "at most countable" and not "countably infinite", and it is why the library's convention that "countable" means "at most countable" ([[def-countable]]) keeps the statement free of case distinctions.

- The dichotomy proved here, bounded subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ are finite and unbounded ones are copies of $\mathbb{N}$, is the only structural fact about $\mathbb{N}$ the rest of the page needs. The enumeration $e$ built in the unbounded case is the increasing one, and it is unique with that property.

- The bounded case rests on the von Neumann encoding: "bounded by $b_0$" is literally "a subset of the set $\sigma(b_0)$", which is what makes the induction of step 1.2 an induction on a natural number rather than on an informal count. That translation is not a convention but a theorem, [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]], since the library's order on $\mathbb{N}$ is defined additively ([[def-nat-order]]) and not by membership.

## Statement

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be nonempty and bounded above, and let $u$ be an
upper bound of $S$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]). Then

$$u = \sup S \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \text{for every } \varepsilon > 0 \text{ there exists } s \in S \text{ with } u - \varepsilon < s.$$

In words: among the upper bounds of $S$, the supremum is exactly the one that
cannot be lowered by any positive amount and still bound $S$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A nonempty $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above, and an upper bound $u$ of $S$; since $S$ is nonempty and bounded above, $\sup S$ exists.

[L1] Supremum: $u = \sup S$ exactly when $u$ is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le u'$ for every upper bound $u'$ of $S$; and every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above has such a least upper bound ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] The least upper bound is unique, so the equation $u = \sup S$ says precisely that $u$ is a least upper bound of $S$ ([[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L3] The order is total: for $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds, so the negation of $a \le b$ is $b < a$; and $a < b$ holds exactly when $b - a > 0$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]). (Translation invariance follows in one line from that last equivalence, since $(b + c) - (a + c) = b - a$, but no step below uses it and it is not claimed here as a quoted result.)

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For the forward implication assume $u = \sup S$, that is, $u$ is an upper bound of $S$ that is $\le$ every upper bound of $S$, and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be arbitrary. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.2 For the converse implication assume that $u$ is an upper bound of $S$ such that for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $s \in S$ with $u - \varepsilon < s$, and let $u'$ be an arbitrary upper bound of $S$. [assume-hyp]

2.1 Since $u - (u - \varepsilon) = \varepsilon > 0$, we have $u - \varepsilon < u$. [step 1.1, L3, algebra]

2.2 By totality either $u \le u'$ or $u' < u$; in the second case put $\varepsilon_0 := u - u'$, so that $\varepsilon_0 > 0$ and $u - \varepsilon_0 = u'$. [step 1.2, L3, algebra]

3.1 The element $u - \varepsilon$ is not an upper bound of $S$: if it were, the leastness of $u$ among upper bounds would give $u \le u - \varepsilon$, which contradicts $u - \varepsilon < u$ by trichotomy. [step 2.1, step 1.1, L1, L3]

3.2 In that second case the hypothesis applied to $\varepsilon_0$ yields $s_0 \in S$ with $u' = u - \varepsilon_0 < s_0$, so $s_0 \le u'$ fails, contradicting that $u'$ is an upper bound of $S$; the second case is therefore impossible and $u \le u'$. [step 2.2, step 1.2, L3]

4.1 Failing to be an upper bound of $S$ means precisely that some $s \in S$ does not satisfy $s \le u - \varepsilon$, and by totality that says $u - \varepsilon < s$; since $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary, the forward implication is proved. [step 3.1, L3]

4.2 Since $u'$ was an arbitrary upper bound of $S$, we get $u \le u'$ for every upper bound $u'$; as $u$ is itself an upper bound, $u$ is a least upper bound of $S$, hence $u = \sup S$ by uniqueness, which proves the converse implication. [step 3.2, step 1.2, L1, L2]

5.1 Both implications hold, so for an upper bound $u$ of a nonempty set $S$ bounded above, $u = \sup S$ if and only if for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $s \in S$ with $u - \varepsilon < s$. [step 4.1, step 4.2] ∎

## Statement

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. If $u_1$ and $u_2$ are both least upper bounds of
$S$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), then $u_1 = u_2$. If $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$
are both greatest lower bounds of $S$ ([[def-infimum]]), then
$\ell_1 = \ell_2$.

Consequently a set has at most one supremum and at most one infimum, and the
notations $\sup S$ and $\inf S$ denote single, well-determined real numbers
whenever they exist.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ of the complete ordered field $\mathbb{R}$, together with elements $u_1, u_2, \ell_1, \ell_2 \in \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] $u$ is a least upper bound of $S$ exactly when $u$ is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le u'$ for every upper bound $u'$ of $S$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] $\ell$ is a greatest lower bound of $S$ exactly when $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$ and $\ell' \le \ell$ for every lower bound $\ell'$ of $S$ ([[def-infimum]]).

[L3] Antisymmetry of the order: for $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$, if $a \le b$ and $b \le a$ then $a = b$. This is trichotomy in the underlying ordered field, which says that exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds, so, reasoning by contradiction, $a \ne b$ would put both $a < b$ and $b < a$ in force, which trichotomy forbids ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $u_1$ and $u_2$ are both least upper bounds of $S$; in particular each of them is an upper bound of $S$ and each is $\le$ every upper bound of $S$. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.2 Assume $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ are both greatest lower bounds of $S$; in particular each of them is a lower bound of $S$ and each is $\ge$ every lower bound of $S$. [assume-hyp, L2]

2.1 Applying the leastness of $u_1$ to the upper bound $u_2$ gives $u_1 \le u_2$, and applying the leastness of $u_2$ to the upper bound $u_1$ gives $u_2 \le u_1$. [step 1.1, L1]

2.2 Applying the greatestness of $\ell_1$ to the lower bound $\ell_2$ gives $\ell_2 \le \ell_1$, and applying the greatestness of $\ell_2$ to the lower bound $\ell_1$ gives $\ell_1 \le \ell_2$. [step 1.2, L2]

3.1 By antisymmetry $u_1 = u_2$ and $\ell_1 = \ell_2$, so a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound of $S$ are each unique when they exist, which is what licenses writing $\sup S$ and $\inf S$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L3] ∎

This page builds the topology of $\mathbb{R}$ out of the order and the absolute
value alone: a neighbourhood is an interval ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), and open
and closed are defined from neighbourhoods ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]). Some
of what follows uses nothing else about $\mathbb{R}$, and some of it is written
in order vocabulary from beginning to end. This remark separates the two, so a
reader knows which results are candidates for reuse elsewhere and which are not
even statable elsewhere. **It asserts nothing about topological spaces in
general: they are developed later in this library, on the page of
[[def-topological-space]] and [[def-metrizable-space]], where the metric
development becomes a special case, but no claim about them is made or needed
here and nothing below rests on them.**

**Results that use only the definitions.** [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]] and
[[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] use openness, closedness, closure and the
nesting property of neighbourhoods, together with the comparison of two positive
radii, and nothing beyond that. Neither the least-upper-bound property nor the
Archimedean property appears in either proof, and their statements mention no
interval, no bound and no order, so those statements would still make sense
wherever a notion of neighbourhood is available, however it arises.

**Results that cannot be separated from the order of $\mathbb{R}$.** Four
results on this page depend on the order. For the first three the order is in
what they say and not merely in how they are proved; for the fourth it is in the
proof only, and the bullet says so.

- [[thm-open-subsets-of-r-structure]] says that an open set is a countable
  disjoint union of **open intervals**. An interval is defined by the order
  ([[def-interval]]), the components are the classes of an equivalence relation
  defined by order-convexity, and the identification of a component as an
  interval is carried out with $\sup$ and $\inf$. Delete the order and there is
  no statement left to prove.
- [[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]] characterises connectedness by
  **order-convexity**. Connectedness itself is defined without the order
  ([[def-connected-r]]), but the property it is being equated with is an order
  property, so the theorem is a bridge between an order notion and a topological
  one and exists only where both are present.
- [[thm-heine-borel-r]] and [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]] speak of
  **closed bounded intervals** and of **bounded** sets. Boundedness is an order
  notion ([[def-bounded-set]]), and the proof of the first is a bisection, which
  uses the midpoint and hence the field operations as well. The completeness of
  $\mathbb{R}$ enters through [[thm-nested-interval-property]].
- [[thm-compact-iff-sequentially-compact-r]] routes **both** implications
  through the previous item, whose backward half spends the least-upper-bound
  property, and its **forward** implication additionally uses
  [[thm-bolzano-weierstrass]], which spends that property again; the backward
  implication does not use Bolzano-Weierstrass at all. Its statement mentions
  only compactness and sequences ([[def-open-cover-r]]), so unlike the three
  above it *is* statable without an order; the dependence lies entirely in the
  proof. This library provides no other proof, so nothing here licenses the
  equivalence outside $\mathbb{R}$.

**Where the dependence on completeness is visible rather than merely present.**
[[fs-closed-bounded-compact-without-completeness]] refutes, inside this library,
the claim that closed and bounded implies compact in an arbitrary ordered field,
and [[cex-closed-bounded-in-q-not-compact]] names the witness in $\mathbb{Q}$.
That is the sharpest statement this page makes about the limits of its own
results: the Heine-Borel characterisation is not a formal consequence of the
definitions, and it fails in the nearest ordered field that is not complete.

**The metric topology of $\mathbb{R}$ is the topology of this page.** This
library does develop metric spaces ([[def-metric-space]],
[[def-metric-topology]]), and $\mathbb{R}$ under $d(x,y) = |x-y|$ is one of them
([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]). The two resulting notions of *open subset
of $\mathbb{R}$* are not merely equivalent but literally the same condition, and
unfolding the definitions is the whole of the proof: claim 2 of that lemma gives
$B(x,r) = (x-r,\ x+r)$, which is exactly the neighbourhood $N_r(x)$ of
[[def-neighbourhood-r]], so "every point of $U$ admits a ball inside $U$" and
"every point of $U$ admits a neighbourhood inside $U$"
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) say the same thing word for word. This page still
proves everything from the order directly, so that nothing here rests on the
metric development; the identification is recorded so that a reader moving
between the two pages knows they are looking at one topology and not two.
Because the two collections of open sets are one collection, everything built
from them is one notion as well. The interior, closure and boundary of
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]] and of
[[def-metric-interior-closure-boundary]] are the same three sets, since each
side characterises them in both of the same two ways, pointwise by
neighbourhoods and by extremality among the open subsets and the closed
supersets ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]],
[[thm-metric-closure-characterisation]]); limit point, isolated point, adherent
point and dense are defined by literally the same condition on the two sides
([[def-limit-point-r]]), once $N_\varepsilon(x)$ and $B(x,\varepsilon)$ are
recognised as the same set; and
[[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]] is the case $X = \mathbb{R}$ of
[[thm-metric-sequential-closure]], spending the axiom of countable choice in the
same one of the two directions.

**Bounded means the same here as it does in the metric development, and that
agreement is not a topological fact.** [[def-bounded-set]] calls
$A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ bounded when it has both a lower and an upper bound,
while [[def-metric-bounded-diameter]] calls it bounded when it is empty or lies
inside some ball of $(\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$. The two conditions hold of
exactly the same subsets of $\mathbb{R}$. If $A \subseteq B(x_0,r) = (x_0 - r,\
x_0 + r)$ ([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]], claim 2, [[def-metric-ball]])
then $x_0 - r$ and $x_0 + r$ bound $A$ below and above; conversely, if
$\ell \le a \le u$ for every $a \in A$ and $A \ne \varnothing$, then $\ell \le u$
and $A \subseteq B(\ell,\ u - \ell + 1)$, the radius being at least $1$ and hence
positive; and an empty $A$ is bounded under both definitions, vacuously under the
first and by the explicit empty clause of the second. So the word **bounded** in
[[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]] may be read in either sense without
changing which sets the theorem names.

What may not be done is to read that theorem as a statement about the topology.
Boundedness is a property of the metric and not of the topology it induces
([[fs-boundedness-is-a-topological-property]]): the metric
$\rho(u,v) = \min\{|u-v|,\ 1\}$ induces exactly the open sets of this page, and
under it every subset of $\mathbb{R}$, including $\mathbb{R}$ itself, is
bounded. Since the open sets are unchanged, compactness ([[def-open-cover-r]])
is unchanged too, and $\mathbb{R}$ is not compact, being unbounded in the order
sense ([[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]]); yet $\mathbb{R}$ is closed,
and $\rho$-bounded. So "closed and bounded implies compact" is false for $\rho$
and true for $d_{\mathbb{R}}$, on one and the same topology. The identification
in the previous paragraph is with the usual metric specifically, and Heine-Borel
is a theorem about that metric and the order it comes from, not about the
topology alone.

**What is deliberately not claimed.** Whether the results above have analogues in
a setting carrying a topology with no order available at all, and whether
compactness and sequential compactness agree there, are questions about general
topological spaces. This library takes those questions up on a later page, where
[[def-metrizable-space]] identifies the metric development, this page's topology
included, as a special case of the general one; but nothing on **this** page
proves anything about general spaces, and the reader should take no assertion
about them from here. What is claimed here is narrower and
is checkable line by line against the proofs: in the four results listed above,
the order of $\mathbb{R}$ is used, and in three of them it is used in the
statement itself.

## Statement

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be nonempty and bounded below. Then $S$ has a
greatest lower bound in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-infimum]]), and it is given by

$$\inf S = -\sup(-S), \qquad \text{where } -S = \{-s : s \in S\}.$$

In particular the complete ordered field $\mathbb{R}$ has the
greatest-lower-bound property, which is therefore not an extra axiom: it is a
consequence of the least-upper-bound property.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A nonempty $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ that is bounded below, and its reflection $-S = \{-s : s \in S\}$.

[L1] The least-upper-bound property of $\mathbb{R}$: every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $\mathbb{R}$, namely an upper bound that is $\le$ every upper bound ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Reflection: $-(-S) = S$; $S$ is nonempty exactly when $-S$ is; $u$ is an upper bound of a set $X$ exactly when $-u$ is a lower bound of $-X$; and $\ell$ is a lower bound of $X$ exactly when $-\ell$ is an upper bound of $-X$ ([[lem-reflection]]).

[L3] Greatest lower bound (infimum): $\ell$ is one for $S$ when $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$ and $\ell' \le \ell$ for every lower bound $\ell'$ of $S$ ([[def-infimum]]).

[L4] A least upper bound and a greatest lower bound are unique when they exist, so the notations $\sup$ and $\inf$ are unambiguous ([[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L5] Negation reverses the order, elementwise: $-(-a) = a$, because $(-a) + a = 0$ and additive inverses are unique ([[def-field]], [[lem-of-inverse-unique]]); and $a \le b$ if and only if $-b \le -a$, because translation invariance applied with the constant $-a - b$ turns $a < b$ into $-b < -a$ and, applied with the constant $a + b$, turns $-b < -a$ back into $a < b$, while $a = b$ holds exactly when $-a = -b$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By hypothesis $S \ne \emptyset$ and $S$ is bounded below; fix a lower bound $\ell_0$ of $S$, so $\ell_0 \le s$ for every $s \in S$. [given, choose]

1.2 Let $\ell'$ be an arbitrary lower bound of $S$; then $-\ell'$ is an upper bound of $-S$. [assume-hyp, L2]

2.1 Since $S$ is nonempty, so is $-S$, and since $\ell_0$ is a lower bound of $S$, its negative $-\ell_0$ is an upper bound of $-S$; hence $-S$ is a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 By the least-upper-bound property, $-S$ has a least upper bound in $\mathbb{R}$; write $u := \sup(-S)$, which is well defined by uniqueness. [step 2.1, L1, L4]

4.1 Define $\ell := -u$. [step 3.1, construct]

4.2 The element $u$ is the least of the upper bounds of $-S$ and $-\ell'$ is one of them, hence $u \le -\ell'$. [step 1.2, step 3.1, L1]

5.1 Apply the reflection fact to the set $-S$: since $u$ is an upper bound of $-S$, its negative $-u$ is a lower bound of $-(-S)$, and $-(-S) = S$; so $\ell = -u$ is a lower bound of $S$. [step 4.1, step 3.1, L2]

5.2 Negating the inequality $u \le -\ell'$ reverses it, giving $-(-\ell') \le -u$, that is $\ell' \le \ell$. [step 4.2, step 4.1, L5]

6.1 Thus $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$ satisfying $\ell' \le \ell$ for every lower bound $\ell'$ of $S$, so $\ell$ is a greatest lower bound of $S$; it is the only one, so $\inf S$ exists and $\inf S = \ell = -\sup(-S)$. [step 5.1, step 5.2, L3, L4] ∎

## Remarks

- The theorem is not a restatement of the least-upper-bound property: it is proved from it, by transporting the problem across the order-reversing bijection $x \mapsto -x$ of [[lem-reflection]]. Nothing about $\mathbb{R}$ beyond the complete-ordered-field axioms is used.
- The hypotheses are both needed. The empty set is bounded below by every real and has no greatest lower bound, and a set unbounded below has no lower bound at all; the dual failures for suprema are recorded in [[fs-every-set-has-sup]].
- The identity $\inf S = -\sup(-S)$ is the standard device for turning any statement about suprema into its dual; [[lem-inf-epsilon]] is the first application on this page.

## Statement

$\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-equinumerous]]): the rationals are
countably infinite ([[def-countable]]).

**No choice principle is used.** The one place where a reader expects a choice,
"pick a representative $a/b$ of each rational", is exactly where
[[lem-rat-positive-denominator]] applies: every rational *has* a representative
with positive denominator, so the map $(a,b) \mapsto [(a,b)]$ defined on
$\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ is already **surjective** onto $\mathbb{Q}$,
and countability follows from a surjection without ever selecting a
representative. The same device handles $\mathbb{Z}$, which is a surjective image
of $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ by construction ([[def-integers]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $\mathbb{Z} = (\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N})/\sim$ with quotient map $(a,b) \mapsto [(a,b)]$ ([[def-integers]]), and $\mathbb{Q}$ the set of classes $[(a,b)]$ of pairs of integers with $b \ne 0$ ([[def-rationals]]). Write $\mathbb{Z}_{>0} = \{\, b \in \mathbb{Z} : b > 0 \,\}$ ([[def-int-order]]).

[L1] Finite, countably infinite, at most countable, uncountable ([[def-countable]]).

[L2] Bijections, injections, surjections, composition; $\approx$ and $\preceq$ ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]], [[def-equinumerous]]).

[L3] A nonempty $X$ is at most countable iff there is a surjection $\mathbb{N} \to X$; and from such a surjection $s$ the map $x \mapsto \min\{\, k : s(k) = x \,\}$ is an injection $X \to \mathbb{N}$ ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]]).

[L4] There is a bijection $\beta : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-n-cross-n-countable]]).

[L5] A product of two at most countable sets is at most countable ([[thm-product-of-countable]]); a subset of an at most countable set is at most countable ([[lem-subset-of-countable]]).

[L6] Every rational is $[(a,b)]$ for some integers $a$ and $b$ with $b > 0$ ([[lem-rat-positive-denominator]]).

[L7] $\mathbb{N}$ embeds injectively in $\mathbb{Z}$ by $n \mapsto [(n,0)]$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]) and $\mathbb{Z}$ embeds injectively in $\mathbb{Q}$ by $k \mapsto [(k,1)]$ ([[lem-int-embeds-rat]]).

[L8] $\preceq$ in both directions gives $\approx$ ([[thm-schroder-bernstein]]).

[L9] The relation of [[def-int-order]] is a total order on $\mathbb{Z}$ compatible with the ring structure ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), and $\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \ne \varnothing$: on representatives $0 < [(a,b)]$ holds exactly when $b < a$ in $\mathbb{N}$ ([[def-int-order]]), and $0 < 1$ in $\mathbb{N}$, since $1 = \sigma(0) \ne 0$ ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]) while $0 < n$ for every nonzero natural $n$ (claim 4 of [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]); so the integer $[(1,0)]$ is positive.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The quotient map $\pi : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$, $\pi(a,b) = [(a,b)]$, is surjective, since every integer is by definition such a class; hence $\pi \circ \beta : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ is a surjection, and $\mathbb{Z} \ne \varnothing$, so $\mathbb{Z}$ is at most countable by [L3]. [given, L2, L3, L4]

1.2 The composite $\iota : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$, $n \mapsto [([(n,0)],1)]$, of the two embeddings of [L7] is injective, so $\mathbb{N} \preceq \mathbb{Q}$. [L2, L7]

2.1 $\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ is a subset of $\mathbb{Z}$, hence at most countable by [L5], and it is nonempty by [L9]; therefore $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ is at most countable by [L5] and nonempty, so [L3] provides a surjection $u : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$. [step 1.1, L3, L5, L9]

3.1 The map $\rho : \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_{>0} \to \mathbb{Q}$, $\rho(a,b) = [(a,b)]$, is well defined because $b > 0$ gives $b \ne 0$, and it is surjective by [L6]; hence $\rho \circ u : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$ is a surjection, $\mathbb{Q}$ is at most countable, and [L3] turns that surjection into an injection $j : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{N}$, so $\mathbb{Q} \preceq \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.1, given, L2, L3, L6]

4.1 From $\mathbb{N} \preceq \mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{Q} \preceq \mathbb{N}$, the Schröder-Bernstein theorem [L8] yields a bijection $\mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{N}$; hence $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ is countably infinite. [step 1.2, step 3.1, L1, L8] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why Schröder-Bernstein rather than a count.** The usual last line is "countable, and infinite because $\mathbb{N}$ injects into it". Turning that into a proof requires knowing that a set containing an injective copy of $\mathbb{N}$ is not finite, which is the pigeonhole principle, [[lem-pigeonhole]], proved earlier on this page. That route is now available, but it is a detour: [[thm-schroder-bernstein]] gets the bijection directly from the two injections already in hand, and it is choice free, so nothing is lost.

- **Lowest terms are not needed and are not available.** A frequent presentation injects $\mathbb{Q}$ into $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{N}$ by sending each rational to its representative in lowest terms. That map needs greatest common divisors, which this library has not developed. Working with a surjection instead of an injection avoids the issue entirely: repetitions in an enumeration are harmless ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]]).

- The proof shows in passing that $\mathbb{Z} \approx \mathbb{N}$, by the same two-injection argument applied to [L7] and step 1.1, and that $\mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{Q}^3$ and so on are countable ([[thm-product-of-countable]]). The contrast with [[thm-r-uncountable]] is the point of the page: adding all limits of rational approximations to $\mathbb{Q}$ changes the size of the set, not merely its arithmetic.

## Statement

Every nonempty subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ has a least element: there is $\ell \in S$ with $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A nonempty subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. Define $T = \{\, n \in \mathbb{N} : \text{every } m \text{ with } m \le n \text{ satisfies } m \notin S \,\}$ (informally, no element of $S$ is $\le n$).

[L1] Induction principle: a subset of $\mathbb{N}$ that contains $0$ and is closed under $\sigma$ equals $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L2] $m < n \iff \sigma(m) \le n$; consequently no $k$ satisfies $n < k < \sigma(n)$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]).

[L3] Exactly one of $s < n$, $s = n$, $n < s$ holds ([[lem-nat-trichotomy]]); and $n < s \iff \sigma(n) \le s$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]).

[L4] $\sigma$ is injective (Peano axiom P2) ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]).

[L5] $\sigma(a) + i = \sigma(a + i)$ for all $a, i$ (the left successor law, [[lem-nat-add-successor-left]]).

[L6] $0 + k = k$ for all $k$ ([[lem-nat-add-identity]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose $S$ is nonempty but has no least element. [assume-contra]

1.2 If $m < \sigma(n)$ then $m \le n$: by [L2] applied to $m$ and $\sigma(n)$ we get $\sigma(m) \le \sigma(n)$, say $\sigma(m) + i = \sigma(n)$; then $\sigma(m + i) = \sigma(m) + i = \sigma(n)$ [L5], so $m + i = n$ by injectivity [L4], hence $m \le n$. [L2, L4, L5]

2.1 First, $0 \in T$: if $0 \in S$ then $0 \le s$ for all $s \in S$, since $0 + s = s$ [L6], making $0$ a least element, contrary to the assumption; hence $0 \notin S$; moreover $m \le 0$ forces $m = 0$, because $m \ne 0$ would give $0 < m$ (as $0 + m = m$ [L6] with $m \ne 0$) while $m \le 0$ gives $m < 0$, and [L3] admits at most one of these; so every $m \le 0$ lies outside $S$. [step 1.1, L3, L6, given]

2.2 Next, $T$ is closed under $\sigma$: assume $n \in T$; if $\sigma(n) \in S$ then no $s \in S$ satisfies $s < \sigma(n)$ (else $s \le n$ by step 1.2, so $s \notin S$ because $n \in T$, a contradiction), hence $\sigma(n) \le s$ for all $s \in S$ by [L3], making $\sigma(n)$ a least element, contrary to the assumption; therefore $\sigma(n) \notin S$, and any $m$ with $m \le \sigma(n)$ satisfies $m = \sigma(n)$ or $m \ne \sigma(n)$; in the second case $m \le \sigma(n)$ together with $m \ne \sigma(n)$ gives $m < \sigma(n)$ by the definition of the strict order, hence $m \le n$ by step 1.2 and $m \notin S$ because $n \in T$, while in the first case $m = \sigma(n) \notin S$; so every $m \le \sigma(n)$ lies outside $S$, giving $\sigma(n) \in T$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L3]

3.1 By the induction principle [L1], from $0 \in T$ and closure under $\sigma$, $T = \mathbb{N}$; then for every $n$, taking $m = n \le n$ shows $n \notin S$, so $S = \varnothing$, contradicting nonemptiness; therefore $S$ has a least element. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L1, discharge-contradiction] ∎
