You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as a
read-only adversarial proof-refuter for the published-page audit. You are
tool-less: you cannot open a file, run a command, browse, edit, or delegate.
Everything you may rely on is reproduced in the `This dispatch` section. Return
evidence only; Audit-Alpha alone adjudicates and edits.

## Triage — the standing rule (verbatim, binding on you)

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct
  citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

## Adversarial standard

Read the target's title, Statement/Definition/Example/Statement refuted, Facts &
Assumptions, every numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks.
Try to falsify the public claim and every load-bearing inference.

1. Compare every cited fact with the supplied source text before alleging that
   it is weak. Check domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, direction, conclusion,
   and whether the source licenses the exact use.
2. Check that the title and public statement assert no more than the proof
   establishes, and that every proof step uses only available premises.
3. Check both directions of biconditionals, uniqueness/existence claims,
   induction and limiting arguments, empty/zero/endpoint/degenerate cases,
   extended-real conventions, index shifts, and hidden division or choice.
4. Re-read Remarks as skeptically as a numbered step. A false mathematical
   remark is a defect even when the proof is sound.
5. When the target is marked `ai-generated`, actively search for a
   counterexample to its claim, witness, or refutation rather than merely
   checking prose consistency.
6. Treat a false public claim, logically invalid proof, missing necessary
   hypothesis, circularity, or materially inaccurate load-bearing citation as
   fatal. Do not inflate an expository omission or a gap closable within thirty
   seconds into a defect.

## Output format

Reply with exactly this structure and no preamble:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

If `DEFECTS`, give one block per finding:

```text
FINDING 1
  location: [exact title, section, fact label, or numbered step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [the exact mathematical assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, missing hypothesis, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]
```

Then always end with:

```text
BOUNDARY: [specific boundary/counterexample checks and their disposition]
SOURCES:  [confirm every supplied cited item used by the target was inspected]
CHECKED:  [confirm the title, public claim, every numbered step, and Remarks were read]

## Statement

**False claim:** if $Z$ and $Y$ are topological spaces, $D \subseteq Z$ is dense
([[def-dense-top]]), and $f, g : Z \to Y$ are continuous
([[def-continuous-map-top]]) with $f(d) = g(d)$ for every $d \in D$, then
$f = g$.

The refutation takes $Z = \mathbb{R}$ with its usual topology
([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]], [[def-metrizable-space]]), the dense set
$D = \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ of rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$
([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and for codomain the two-point set
$Y_0 = \{a,b\}$ with $a \ne b$ carrying the **indiscrete** topology
([[def-standard-topologies]]), which is not Hausdorff
([[def-hausdorff-space]]). The maps are the constant $f \equiv a$ and the map
$g$ equal to $a$ at every rational and to $b$ at every irrational. Both are
continuous, they agree on $D$, and they differ at every irrational.

The hypothesis the claim drops is the Hausdorff condition on the **codomain**,
which is what
[[cor-two-continuous-maps-into-a-hausdorff-space-agreeing-on-a-dense-set-are-equal]]
assumes.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $\mathbb{R}$ with its usual topology; the set $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ of rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$; and a two-element set $Y_0 = \{a,b\}$ with $a \ne b$.

[A1] $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is open in the usual topology exactly when for every $x \in U$ there is a real $r > 0$ with $(x-r, x+r) \subseteq U$ ([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]], claims 2 and 3, [[def-metrizable-space]], [[def-interval]]).

[A2] The indiscrete topology on $Y_0$ is $\{\varnothing, Y_0\}$; the two-point indiscrete space is not Hausdorff, the only open set containing either point being $Y_0$ ([[def-standard-topologies]], [[def-hausdorff-space]], [[def-topological-space]]).

[A3] $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is dense exactly when $U \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every nonempty open $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-dense-top]], form 2).

[L1] A function between topological spaces is continuous exactly when the preimage of every open set is open ([[thm-continuity-characterisations-top]], clauses (a) and (b), [[def-continuous-map-top]]).

[L2] Strictly between any two reals lies a rational ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L3] The set $\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ of irrationals is uncountable ([[cor-irrationals-uncountable]]); an uncountable set is not finite and the empty set is finite, so it is nonempty ([[def-countable]]).

[L4] Two continuous maps into a **Hausdorff** space agreeing on a dense subset of their common domain are equal ([[cor-two-continuous-maps-into-a-hausdorff-space-agreeing-on-a-dense-set-are-equal]]).

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 Give $Y_0 = \{a,b\}$ the indiscrete topology; it is not Hausdorff. [A2, construct]

1.2 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$: given a nonempty open $U$, pick $x \in U$ and by [A1] a real $r > 0$ with $(x-r, x+r) \subseteq U$; by [L2] some rational lies strictly between $x - r$ and $x + r$, hence in $U$. [A1, A3, L2]

1.3 There is a real $t \notin \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, the set of irrationals being nonempty. [L3, choose]

2.1 Every function $h$ from a topological space into $Y_0$ is continuous: the only open subsets of $Y_0$ are $\varnothing$ and $Y_0$, whose preimages are $\varnothing$ and the whole domain, both open. [step 1.1, A2, L1]

3.1 Define $f : \mathbb{R} \to Y_0$ by $f(x) := a$ for every $x$, and $g : \mathbb{R} \to Y_0$ by $g(x) := a$ for $x \in \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and $g(x) := b$ otherwise; both are continuous by step 2.1. [step 2.1, construct]

4.1 $f$ and $g$ agree at every point of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, which is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ by step 1.2. [step 1.2, step 3.1]

4.2 $f(t) = a$ and $g(t) = b$ for the irrational $t$ of step 1.3, and $a \ne b$, so $f \ne g$. [step 1.3, step 3.1]

5.1 Steps 3.1, 4.1 and 4.2 exhibit two continuous maps agreeing on a dense subset of their common domain and not equal, so the claim is false; by step 1.1 the codomain is not Hausdorff, which is exactly the hypothesis [L4] carries and the claim drops. [step 1.1, step 3.1, step 4.1, step 4.2, L4, discharge-construct] ∎

## Remarks

- **The failure is as large as it can be.** The two maps agree precisely on $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and differ at every other point of $\mathbb{R}$, so nothing is salvaged by weakening the conclusion from equality to agreement off a small set: the disagreement set is the whole of the irrationals.

- **Continuity is not being cheated.** Both maps are continuous for the honest reason recorded in step 2.1, that the codomain has only two open sets. No pathology of $\mathbb{R}$ is involved, and the same construction runs with $\mathbb{R}$ replaced by any space with a dense subset that is not the whole space.

- **Why a two-point codomain suffices.** The Hausdorff condition is a statement about pairs of distinct points, so the smallest space that can fail it has two points, and the indiscrete topology is the coarsest topology on it. Taking the coarsest topology is also what makes every map into it continuous, so the witness needs no verification of continuity beyond counting the open sets.

## Statement

Let $\mathbb{R}$ be a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and
let $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$ be the canonical embedding
([[lem-of-q-embeds]]); write $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} = \iota[\mathbb{Q}]$ for the
copy of the rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$, the set usually written $\mathbb{Q}$
once the identification is made. Then the set of **irrationals**

$$\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$$

is uncountable ([[def-countable]]).

**Only the union of two sets is used, and that needs no choice whatsoever.** If
the irrationals were at most countable, then $\mathbb{R}$ would be the union of
the two at most countable sets $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and
$\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, and countability of a two-set
union is proved by interleaving two given enumerations. The countable union
theorem, which does spend $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$, is **not** invoked here and is
not needed; see the remarks below.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $\mathbb{R}$, the canonical embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$, the subset $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} = \iota[\mathbb{Q}]$ and its complement $X = \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, so that $\mathbb{R} = \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \cup X$.

[L1] $\iota$ is injective ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), hence a bijection of $\mathbb{Q}$ onto $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$; $\approx$ is transitive ([[def-equinumerous]], [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L2] $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$, so $\mathbb{Q}$ is at most countable ([[thm-rationals-countable]]).

[L3] A nonempty set is at most countable if and only if some surjection $\mathbb{N} \to$ it exists ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]]); uncountable means not at most countable ([[def-countable]]).

[L4] There is a bijection $\beta : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-n-cross-n-countable]]).

[L5] $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable ([[thm-r-uncountable]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $X = \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is at most countable. [assume-contra]

1.2 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \approx \mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ by [L1] and [L2], so $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is at most countable, and it is nonempty since $\iota(0) \in \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$. [L1, L2]

1.3 Fix the bijection $\beta : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ of [L4]. [L4]

2.1 If $X = \varnothing$ then $\mathbb{R} = \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, which is at most countable by step 1.2. [step 1.2, given]

2.2 Otherwise $X \ne \varnothing$, and since $X$ is at most countable by assumption and $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is nonempty and at most countable by step 1.2, [L3] provides surjections $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and $g : \mathbb{N} \to X$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L3]

3.1 Define $u : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ by $u(0,k) = f(k)$ and $u(n,k) = g(k)$ for $n \ne 0$. Every element of $\mathbb{R}$ lies in $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ or in $X$, hence is $f(k)$ or $g(k)$ for some $k$, so $u$ is surjective onto $\mathbb{R}$. The two surjections were obtained one after the other, not selected simultaneously from an infinite family, so no choice principle is used. [step 2.2, given]

4.1 Hence $u \circ \beta : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a surjection and $\mathbb{R} \ne \varnothing$, so $\mathbb{R}$ is at most countable by [L3]. [step 1.3, step 3.1, L3]

5.1 In either case $\mathbb{R}$ is at most countable, by step 2.1 in the first and step 4.1 in the second; this contradicts [L5]. Therefore $X = \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is uncountable. [step 2.1, step 4.1, L3, L5, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- The same argument shows that removing any at most countable set from $\mathbb{R}$ leaves an uncountable set. In particular the algebraic numbers, once they are available, can be removed to show transcendental numbers exist, which is how Cantor's 1874 paper presented the result: an existence proof for transcendentals with no example constructed.

- The corollary is a statement about the *set* of irrationals only. It says nothing about any individual irrational, and it does not exhibit one; the library exhibits $\sqrt{2}$ separately ([[ex-sqrt-two-exists]], [[fs-sqrt2-rational]]).

- Keeping the two-set union separate from the countable union is not pedantry. The countable case genuinely needs $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ ([[thm-countable-union-of-countable]]) and is unprovable in ZF conditionally on the consistency of ZF, which is the honest form of [[fs-countable-union-theorem-of-zf]] and rests on an external independence result quoted there rather than proved; whereas this corollary, like [[thm-r-uncountable]] itself, is outright a theorem of ZF.

## Statement

Let $Z$ be a topological space, let $D \subseteq Z$ be dense
([[def-dense-top]]), let $Y$ be Hausdorff ([[def-hausdorff-space]]) and let
$f, g : Z \to Y$ be continuous ([[def-continuous-map-top]]) with

$$f(d) = g(d) \qquad \text{for every } d \in D .$$

Then $f = g$.

So a continuous map into a Hausdorff space is determined by its restriction to
any dense subset of its domain. Nothing is asserted about *which* functions on
$D$ extend: the statement is about uniqueness of an extension, not existence.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A topological space $Z$, a dense subset $D \subseteq Z$, a Hausdorff space $Y$, and continuous maps $f, g : Z \to Y$ agreeing at every point of $D$.

[A1] $D$ is dense in $Z$, that is $\overline{D} = Z$ ([[def-dense-top]]).

[L1] The agreement set $E(f,g) = \{\, z \in Z : f(z) = g(z) \,\}$ is closed in $Z$ ([[cor-the-agreement-set-of-two-maps-into-a-hausdorff-space-is-closed]], [[def-hausdorff-space]], [[def-continuous-map-top]]).

[L2] $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed superset of $A$: it is contained in every closed set containing $A$ ([[thm-closure-characterisation-top]], claim 2, [[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $E(f,g)$ is closed in $Z$. [L1]

1.2 $D \subseteq E(f,g)$, since $f$ and $g$ agree at every point of $D$. [given]

2.1 $Z = \overline{D} \subseteq E(f,g)$, the equality by [A1] and the inclusion because $E(f,g)$ is a closed set containing $D$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, A1, L2]

3.1 $E(f,g) \subseteq Z$ holds by definition, so $E(f,g) = Z$, that is $f(z) = g(z)$ for every $z \in Z$ and $f = g$. [step 2.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The Hausdorff hypothesis is spent exactly once**, inside [L1], and the density hypothesis exactly once, at step 2.1. Neither is used anywhere else, and neither can be weakened to the other: a dense agreement set alone does not force equality without a separation hypothesis on the codomain, and a Hausdorff codomain alone plainly does not.

- **Density is a hypothesis about $Z$, not about $Y$.** In particular the statement is about one domain and one dense subset of it; it says nothing about restrictions to subsets that are merely large in some other sense, and there is no cardinality condition anywhere in it.

- **The uniqueness/existence split matters.** A continuous $f : D \to Y$ need not extend continuously to $Z$ at all. What this corollary rules out is *two different* extensions, and that is exactly what makes an extension, when it exists, worth naming.

## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be topological spaces
([[def-topological-space]]), let $f : X \to Y$ be a function and let $x \in X$.
Neighbourhoods are as in [[def-neighbourhood-top]].

$f$ is **continuous at $x$** if for every neighbourhood $V$ of $f(x)$ in $Y$ the
preimage $f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ in $X$.

$f$ is **continuous** if it is continuous at every point of $X$.

**The same condition with open sets only.** $f$ is continuous at $x$ if and only
if for every open $V \subseteq Y$ with $f(x) \in V$ there is an open
$U \subseteq X$ with $x \in U$ and $f[U] \subseteq V$. Indeed, if $f$ is
continuous at $x$ and $V$ is such an open set, then $V$ is a neighbourhood of
$f(x)$, so $f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ and contains an open $U \ni x$,
which satisfies $f[U] \subseteq V$. Conversely, given the displayed condition and
a neighbourhood $V$ of $f(x)$, fix open $V_0$ with $f(x) \in V_0 \subseteq V$ and
then open $U \ni x$ with $f[U] \subseteq V_0$; then $x \in U \subseteq f^{-1}[V_0] \subseteq f^{-1}[V]$,
so $f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$. Both forms are used below and are the
same statement written twice.

**Preimage, not image.** $f^{-1}[V] = \{\, x \in X : f(x) \in V \,\}$
is the preimage in the sense of [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]] and is
defined for every function, invertible or not; no inverse function is being
asserted to exist. Continuity is a condition on preimages throughout, and the
corresponding conditions on images define the *open* and *closed* maps of a later
item, which are different notions.

## Remarks

- **This is the metric definition when both topologies are metric topologies.**
  For metric spaces, $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ continuity at $a$
  ([[def-metric-continuity]]) says that every ball around $f(a)$ has a ball
  around $a$ mapped into it, and the balls around a point are a neighbourhood
  base there; the identification is carried out where metrizable spaces are
  defined later on this page. Nothing about a metric survives in the definition
  above: continuity is a relation between two topologies and a function, and it
  is meaningless to ask whether a function between bare sets is continuous.

- **Continuity depends on both topologies, and coarsening the target or refining
  the source only helps.** If $f$ is continuous and $\mathcal{T}_X$ is replaced
  by a finer topology, or $\mathcal{T}_Y$ by a coarser one, $f$ remains
  continuous, since each condition to be verified is weakened and each
  neighbourhood available in the source is still available. In particular every
  map out of a discrete space and every map into an indiscrete space is
  continuous ([[def-standard-topologies]]).

- **Continuity at a point is strictly weaker than continuity.** A function may be
  continuous at exactly one point, and the definition above is deliberately local
  so that the sequential criteria proved later can be stated pointwise.

## Definition

Recall that a natural number is a von Neumann natural
([[def-natural-numbers]]): $0 = \varnothing$ and $\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$, so
that

$$n = \{\, m \in \mathbb{N} : m < n \,\} = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$$

is itself the set of its predecessors. Here $<$ is the order of
[[def-nat-order]], which is defined additively, so the displayed identity is a
theorem and not a convention: it is [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]], proved
immediately above. Let $A$ be a set, and let $\approx$ be equinumerosity
([[def-equinumerous]]).

- $A$ is **finite** if $A \approx n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
- $A$ is **countably infinite** if $A \approx \mathbb{N}$.
- $A$ is **at most countable** if it is finite or countably infinite.
- $A$ is **uncountable** if it is not at most countable.

## Remarks

- **Convention: in this library "countable" alone always means "at most
  countable"**, so a finite set is countable. This is the convention of Halmos
  and of Tao, and it is the one that makes the theorems on this page read
  cleanly: subsets, products and unions of countable sets are countable, with no
  finite/infinite case split in the statement. The competing convention, used by
  Rudin among others, reserves "countable" for "countably infinite" and says
  "at most countable" for the disjunction. Under that convention every statement
  below still holds after replacing "countable" with "at most countable", but
  several would become false as literally written. Where the distinction
  matters, the long forms "countably infinite" and "at most countable" are used
  in full, and "uncountable" always means "not at most countable", on which the
  two conventions agree.

- **The three classes are exhaustive by construction**: every set is finite,
  countably infinite, or uncountable, since "uncountable" is defined as the
  negation of the disjunction. That they are also mutually exclusive, that is,
  that no set is both finite and countably infinite, is a genuine theorem
  amounting to $\mathbb{N} \not\approx n$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and it is
  proved immediately above as claim 4 of [[lem-pigeonhole]]. So a countably
  infinite set is never finite, and "$A$ is infinite", meaning not finite, is
  implied by $A \approx \mathbb{N}$. The same lemma pins down finiteness itself:
  by its claim 3 a finite set is equinumerous with exactly one natural number, so
  the number of elements of a finite set is well defined, and by its claim 5 no
  finite set is equinumerous with a proper subset of itself.

- **What the exclusivity is and is not used for below.** Nothing on this page
  needs it in order to run: the infinitude of $\mathbb{Q}$, for instance, is
  obtained by exhibiting a bijection $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ directly
  ([[thm-rationals-countable]]) rather than by ruling out finiteness. It is used
  where the two notions of infinity are compared
  ([[fs-infinite-has-countable-subset-in-zf]]) and where the continuum hypothesis
  is instantiated at $\mathbb{N}$ ([[rem-continuum-hypothesis]]), both of which
  need $\mathbb{N}$ to be infinite as a fact rather than as a convention.

- **$0$ and the empty set.** $0 = \varnothing$, and $A \approx 0$ holds exactly
  when $A = \varnothing$, so the empty set is finite. This matters in the proofs
  below, where the empty case is always separated out: a surjection
  $\mathbb{N} \to A$ cannot exist when $A = \varnothing$, which is why
  [[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]] assumes $A$ nonempty.

- **Countability is a property of a set alone**, not of a set with structure. In
  particular $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable while carrying a dense order, and
  $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable; neither statement says anything on its own about
  the order or the arithmetic those sets carry.

## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, let $\mathcal{B}$ be a basis for
$\mathcal{T}$ ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]) and let $A \subseteq X$. Interior
and closure are as in [[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]].

- $A$ is **dense** in $X$ if $\overline{A} = X$.
- $A$ is **codense** in $X$ if $X \setminus A$ is dense.
- $A$ is **nowhere dense** in $X$ if $\operatorname{int}(\overline{A}) = \varnothing$.

**Three equivalent forms of density, and the one used in practice.** The
following are equivalent:

1. $\overline{A} = X$;
2. $U \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every nonempty open $U \subseteq X$;
3. $B \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every nonempty $B \in \mathcal{B}$.

*Proof.* (1) $\Rightarrow$ (2): if $U$ is open and nonempty, pick $x \in U$; then
$x \in \overline{A}$, so $U \cap A \ne \varnothing$ by clause (c) of
[[thm-closure-characterisation-top]]. (2) $\Rightarrow$ (3): a nonempty member of
$\mathcal{B}$ is a nonempty open set. (3) $\Rightarrow$ (1): let $x \in X$; every
$B \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B$ is nonempty and so meets $A$, hence
$x \in \overline{A}$ by clause (d) of [[thm-closure-characterisation-top]]. Form
3 is what makes density checkable: for the Sorgenfrey line it is a statement
about half-open intervals, and for a metric space a statement about balls.

**Codensity is emptiness of the interior.** $A$ is codense if and only if
$\operatorname{int}(A) = \varnothing$, because
$X \setminus \operatorname{int}(A) = \overline{X \setminus A}$
([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]), so $\overline{X \setminus A} = X$ holds
exactly when $\operatorname{int}(A) = \varnothing$.

**Nowhere dense implies codense, and the converse fails.** If
$\operatorname{int}(\overline{A}) = \varnothing$ then
$\operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq \operatorname{int}(\overline{A}) = \varnothing$
by monotonicity of the interior, so $A$ is codense. The two notions can differ
only on sets whose closure is larger than themselves, and there they sometimes
do: a dense set with empty interior, such as the rationals inside the real line,
is codense and is not nowhere dense, its closure being everything. They may also
agree on such a set: $(0,1)$ inside $\mathbb{R}$ has closure $[0,1]$ and is
neither codense nor nowhere dense. A *closed* set is nowhere dense
precisely when it is codense, since then $\overline{A} = A$.

## Remarks

- **Density is a property of the pair, not of the set.** A subset dense in $X$
  need not be dense in a space with a finer topology. In a nonempty indiscrete
  space every nonempty subset is dense, while $\varnothing$ is not; in the empty
  space $\varnothing$ is dense as well. Where a density claim is made below the
  topology is always named.

- **The empty set.** $\varnothing$ is nowhere dense and codense in every space,
  and it is dense only in $X = \varnothing$. $X$ itself is dense in $X$ and is
  nowhere dense only when $X = \varnothing$.

- **What is deliberately not defined here.** Separability, meaning the existence
  of an at most countable dense subset, is a countability axiom not developed at
  this point in the reading order; it is defined later in
  [[def-separable-space]]. Where a space on the companion page has an at most
  countable dense subset, that is what is said in full.

## Definition

A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ ([[def-topological-space]]) is
**Hausdorff** when any two distinct points are separated by disjoint open sets:
for all $x, y \in X$ with $x \ne y$ there are $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$ with

$$x \in U, \qquad y \in V, \qquad U \cap V = \varnothing .$$

Since an open set containing a point is an open neighbourhood of it
([[def-neighbourhood-top]]), the condition reads: distinct points have disjoint
open neighbourhoods. Nothing is asserted about points that are equal, and the
condition is vacuous for a space with at most one point, so every such space is
Hausdorff.

**Every metrizable space is Hausdorff.** This is not proved here, because it is
already discharged: [[def-metrizable-space]] records it among the two things
every metrizable space has, deriving it from
[[thm-metric-hausdorff-separation]], which separates $p \ne q$ in a metric space
by the disjoint open balls $B(p,r)$ and $B(q,r)$ with $r = d(p,q)/2 > 0$. In
particular $\mathbb{R}$ with its usual topology, every $\mathbb{R}^n$, and every
subspace of a metrizable space are Hausdorff.

**Not every space is Hausdorff.** The indiscrete topology
$\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{ind}} = \{\varnothing, X\}$ on a set $X = \{a,b\}$ with
$a \ne b$ ([[def-standard-topologies]]) is not: the only open set containing $a$
is $X$, the only one containing $b$ is $X$, and $X \cap X = X \ne \varnothing$.
This is the same two-point space that [[def-metrizable-space]] uses to exhibit a
topology induced by no metric, and the reason is the same one: failure of the
Hausdorff condition is an obstruction to metrizability.

**Being Hausdorff is a topological property** ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]).
If $h : X \to Z$ is a homeomorphism and $X$ is Hausdorff, then for $z \ne z'$ in
$Z$ the points $h^{-1}(z)$ and $h^{-1}(z')$ are distinct, so they have disjoint
open $U, V$; the images $h[U]$ and $h[V]$ are open, disjoint, and contain $z$ and
$z'$ respectively, a homeomorphism carrying the open sets of one space
bijectively onto those of the other. So no space homeomorphic to a Hausdorff
space fails the condition.

**Scope of this item.** Only the definition, the metrizable case and the
two-point failure are recorded here, because that is all this page uses. The
Hausdorff condition is one of a graded family of separation axioms; that family,
its ordering, and the questions of which of its members are hereditary or
preserved by products, are not available at this point in the reading order and
nothing here anticipates them. What this page does use is a single negative
result: a quotient of a Hausdorff space need not be Hausdorff, which is recorded
below as a false statement and witnessed on the companion page.

## Remarks

- **Hausdorff spaces have closed singletons.** Fix $x \in X$ and take the union
  of all open subsets of $X$ that avoid $x$. Every $y \ne x$ belongs to one of
  them, by Hausdorff separation of $x$ and $y$, while $x$ belongs to none. The
  union is therefore exactly $X \setminus \{x\}$, so $\{x\}$ is closed.
  Thus the Hausdorff property implies the singleton-closed ($T_1$) property.
  The converse fails: closed singletons need not give disjoint neighbourhoods
  of distinct points.

- **What the Hausdorff condition buys, in the one place this page needs it.**
  Separation of distinct points by disjoint open sets is exactly what a quotient
  map can destroy: identifying points of a Hausdorff space can leave two classes
  every pair of whose open neighbourhoods meet, and the companion page exhibits
  such a quotient of a metrizable space. Nothing weaker than an explicit witness
  settles that, since the condition is a statement about all pairs of open sets.

- **The name.** Hausdorff's own 1914 axiom system for a topological space
  included this condition, so "topological space" once meant what is now called a
  Hausdorff space; this library follows the modern convention in which
  [[def-topological-space]] assumes no separation at all and every separation
  hypothesis is stated where it is used.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ ([[def-topological-space]]) is
**metrizable** if there is a metric $d$ on $X$ ([[def-metric-space]]) whose
metric topology is $\mathcal{T}$, that is $\mathcal{T} = \mathcal{T}_d$
([[def-metric-topology]]). Such a $d$ is said to **induce** or **metrise**
$\mathcal{T}$.

**The definition presupposes that $\mathcal{T}_d$ is a topology in the sense of
[[def-topological-space]], and it is.** By [[def-metric-topology]] both
$\varnothing$ and $X$ are open in $(X,d)$, which is (T1), and by
[[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]] the family $\mathcal{T}_d$ is closed under
arbitrary unions, which is (T2), and under intersections of $n \ge 1$ members,
which contains (T3). So every metric space is a topological space, and the
metric-space development of this library is a special case of the present one.

**The standard local notions in the two developments agree after translating
their neighbourhood conventions.** Let $d$ be a metric on $X$ and give $X$ the
topology $\mathcal{T}_d$.

- *Neighbourhoods and balls.* [[def-metric-topology]] uses "neighbourhood" for
  an open set containing $x$, whereas [[def-neighbourhood-top]] also allows a
  non-open superset of such a set. Thus the two collections are not literally
  equal, but the open metric neighbourhoods are cofinal in the broader
  neighbourhood filter. The balls $B(x,r)$, $r > 0$ ([[def-metric-ball]]), are
  open ([[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]]) and form a neighbourhood base at $x$:
  any neighbourhood $N$ contains an open $U \ni x$, hence a ball around $x$ by
  [[def-metric-topology]]. The balls of radius $1/n$ alone already suffice
  ([[lem-metric-ball-neighbourhood-base]]).
- *Interior, closure, boundary.* [[def-metric-interior-closure-boundary]] defines
  them by the same conditions with balls in place of neighbourhoods, and the
  previous bullet makes the two conditions equivalent; the metric closure is the
  smallest closed superset ([[thm-metric-closure-characterisation]]), which is the
  definition used here ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]). So the two
  closures, the two interiors and the two boundaries are the same three
  operations.
- *Convergence.* $x_k \to p$ in the sense of [[def-sequence-convergence-top]] is
  "eventually in every neighbourhood of $p$", and by the first bullet this is
  "eventually in every ball around $p$", which is [[def-metric-convergence]].
- *Continuity.* $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ continuity at $a$
  ([[def-metric-continuity]]) says that every ball around $f(a)$ has a ball
  around $a$ mapped into it, which by the first bullet is continuity at $a$ in
  the sense of [[def-continuous-map-top]].

- *Subspaces.* For $A \subseteq X$ the subspace topology
  $\{\, U \cap A : U \in \mathcal{T}_d \,\}$ of [[def-subspace-topology-top]] is
  exactly the metric topology of the subspace metric $d_A$
  ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]), so the two uses of the phrase
  *subspace topology* in this library name one thing. Indeed
  $B_A(a,r) = B_X(a,r) \cap A$: a trace $U \cap A$ is $d_A$-open, since each of
  its points $a$ has $B_X(a,r) \subseteq U$ and hence $B_A(a,r) \subseteq U \cap A$;
  and a $d_A$-open $W$ is the trace of
  $U := \bigcup \{\, B_X(a,r) : a \in W,\ r > 0,\ B_X(a,r) \cap A \subseteq W \,\}$,
  which is $d_X$-open, satisfies $U \cap A = W$, and involves no choice principle,
  the union being taken over a set of pairs rather than over a selection.

Consequently the metric-space notions of interior, closure, boundary, density,
convergence, continuity and subspace agree with the topological notions here,
and statements about them transfer once a metric is named. For neighbourhoods
the transfer uses the explicit convention change above: a metric-page
neighbourhood is an open topological neighbourhood, while every topological
neighbourhood contains one.

**Metrizability is a topological property; the metric is not part of it.** If
$h : X \to Y$ is a homeomorphism ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]) and $d$
metrises $X$, then $d'(y_1,y_2) := d(h^{-1}(y_1), h^{-1}(y_2))$ is a metric on
$Y$ — the three axioms transfer along the bijection $h^{-1}$ — and
$h[B_d(x,r)] = B_{d'}(h(x), r)$, so $h$ carries a basis of $\mathcal{T}_d$ to a
basis of $\mathcal{T}_{d'}$ and $\mathcal{T}_{d'} = h[\mathcal{T}_d] = \mathcal{T}_Y$.
Hence $Y$ is metrizable. The metric itself, however, is **not** determined by the
topology: two metrics on one set may induce the same topology without agreeing,
which is exactly topological equivalence ([[def-equivalent-metrics]]), and
properties of a metric that are not properties of its topology, boundedness among
them, are therefore not properties of a metrizable space.

**Two things every metrizable space has.** It is **Hausdorff**: distinct points
have disjoint open neighbourhoods, by [[thm-metric-hausdorff-separation]] applied
to any metric inducing the topology. And it is **first countable**
([[def-first-countable-top]]), by [[lem-metric-ball-neighbourhood-base]]. Either
failure is therefore an obstruction to metrizability, and this page uses the
first of them to exhibit a topology induced by no metric.

**Sequential limits in a metrizable space are unique, so the notation
$\lim_k x_k$ is available there.** In a metric space a sequence has at most one
limit ([[lem-metric-limits-unique]]), and by the agreement of convergence above
that uniqueness is a statement about the topology alone; so within a metrizable
space, and only there, this page writes $\lim_k x_k$ in the ordinary way. In a
general space the symbol is unavailable ([[def-sequence-convergence-top]]).

**The usual topology of $\mathbb{R}$.** The absolute value makes $\mathbb{R}$ a
metric space under $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) = |x-y|$, its open balls are the bounded
open intervals, and the resulting metric topology is what claim 3 of
[[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]] names the **usual topology** of $\mathbb{R}$.
That is the topology meant by the phrase throughout these two pages, and
$\mathbb{R}$ carrying it is metrizable by definition. Every statement about it on
these two pages is proved from the metric $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ and the bridge above,
and no example re-derives any of it.

## Remarks

- **The usual topology of $\mathbb{R}$ is not a second notion alongside the
  order-native development built earlier in this library.**
  [[rem-r-native-topology-scope]] records that the two collections of open subsets
  of $\mathbb{R}$ — the one defined from balls and the one defined from
  order-neighbourhoods — are literally the same collection, and hence that
  interior, closure, boundary, limit point, density and sequential convergence
  agree on the two sides. That identification is quoted here for orientation only;
  the order-topology example on the companion page is where the order-native
  description is used.

- **A metrizable space comes with many metrics and no canonical one.** The
  statement "$X$ is metrizable" asserts existence, and every argument that uses a
  metric must name one first. Where two metrics are compared, the vocabulary is
  that of [[def-equivalent-metrics]]: Lipschitz, uniform and topological
  equivalence, of which only the last is visible to the topology.

- **Metrization theorems are not proved here.** Necessary conditions are easy —
  Hausdorff, first countable — and sufficient ones require separation and
  countability axioms that this page does not develop. Nothing below asserts that
  a space *is* metrizable except by exhibiting a metric.

- **Not every topology is metrizable**, and the cheapest witness is the
  indiscrete topology on a two-point set, which is not Hausdorff. That is
  recorded on this page as a false statement and witnessed on the companion page.

## Definition

Throughout, a topology is as in [[def-topological-space]], and *finite*,
*at most countable* and *uncountable* are as in [[def-countable]], so that
"countable" always means "at most countable" and every finite set is countable.
Let $X$ be a set. The six families below are topologies on $X$; that each really
satisfies (T1), (T2) and (T3) is discharged in full after the list.

1. **Discrete topology.** $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{disc}} := \mathcal{P}(X)$: every
   subset is open, hence every subset is closed, hence every subset is clopen.
2. **Indiscrete topology.** $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{ind}} := \{\varnothing, X\}$.
   Its closed sets are again $\varnothing$ and $X$.
3. **Cofinite topology.**
   $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{cof}} := \{\varnothing\} \cup \{\, U \subseteq X : X \setminus U \text{ is finite} \,\}$.
   Its closed sets are $X$ together with the finite subsets of $X$.
4. **Cocountable topology.**
   $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{coc}} := \{\varnothing\} \cup \{\, U \subseteq X : X \setminus U \text{ is at most countable} \,\}$.
   Its closed sets are $X$ together with the at most countable subsets of $X$.
5. **Particular-point topology.** Fix $p \in X$ and put
   $\mathcal{T}_p := \{\varnothing\} \cup \{\, U \subseteq X : p \in U \,\}$: the
   open sets are $\varnothing$ and the sets containing $p$. Its closed sets are
   $X$ together with the sets **not** containing $p$.
6. **Sierpinski topology.** On a two-point set $S = \{a, b\}$ with $a \ne b$,
   $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{Sier}} := \{\varnothing, \{b\}, S\}$. The pair
   $(S, \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{Sier}})$ is **Sierpinski space**; $b$ is its open
   point and $a$ its closed point. This is exactly the particular-point topology
   of item 5 on a two-point set with particular point $b$, listed separately
   because it is quoted so often.

**Two elementary facts about finite sets are used below, and both are proved
here.**

*(i) A subset of a finite set is finite.* Let $F \approx n$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}$
([[def-equinumerous]], [[def-natural-numbers]]), witnessed by a bijection
$\varphi : F \to n$, and let $B \subseteq F$. Then $\varphi$ restricts to a
bijection of $B$ onto $\varphi[B] \subseteq n$
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]). Every element of the von Neumann natural
$n$ is a natural number strictly smaller than $n$
([[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]), so $\varphi[B]$ is a subset of $\mathbb{N}$
bounded above by $n$, hence finite by the sharper form of
[[lem-subset-of-countable]] ("a subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is finite if it is
bounded above"). Since $\approx$ is symmetric and transitive, $B$ is finite.

*(ii) A union of two finite sets is finite.* First, if $H$ is finite and $g$ is
any object then $H \cup \{g\}$ is finite: if $g \in H$ there is nothing to prove,
and otherwise a bijection $u : H \to k$ extends to a bijection
$H \cup \{g\} \to k \cup \{k\} = \sigma(k)$ by setting $u(g) := k$, which is
injective because $k \notin k$ ([[lem-nat-transitive-irreflexive]]). Now fix a
finite set $F$ and argue by induction ([[thm-induction-principle]]) on
$m \in \mathbb{N}$ over the statement "for every $G$ with $G \approx m$, the union
$F \cup G$ is finite". At $m = 0$ we have $G = \varnothing$ and $F \cup G = F$. At
$m = \sigma(j)$, a bijection $\psi : G \to \sigma(j)$ gives $g := \psi^{-1}(j)$
and $G' := G \setminus \{g\} \approx j$ (restrict $\psi$), so
$F \cup G = (F \cup G') \cup \{g\}$ is finite by the induction hypothesis and the
previous sentence.

**Discharge of the topology axioms.**

*Discrete.* Every subset of $X$ lies in $\mathcal{P}(X)$, so (T1), (T2) and (T3)
hold with nothing to check.

*Indiscrete.* (T1) is the definition. For (T2), a subfamily of
$\{\varnothing, X\}$ has union $\varnothing$ (if it is empty or $\{\varnothing\}$)
or $X$ (otherwise). For (T3), $\varnothing \cap A = \varnothing$ and
$X \cap X = X$.

*Cofinite.* (T1): $\varnothing$ is listed, and $X \setminus X = \varnothing$ is
finite. (T2): let $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{cof}}$. If every
member is $\varnothing$ the union is $\varnothing$. Otherwise fix
$U_0 \in \mathcal{S}$ with $U_0 \ne \varnothing$; then
$X \setminus \bigcup \mathcal{S} \subseteq X \setminus U_0$, which is finite, so
the left side is finite by (i). (T3): for nonempty $U, V$ with finite
complements, $X \setminus (U \cap V) = (X \setminus U) \cup (X \setminus V)$ is
finite by (ii); and if either of $U, V$ is empty so is $U \cap V$. The closed sets
are the complements of the open ones, that is $X = X \setminus \varnothing$
together with the finite sets.

*Cocountable.* Identical to the cofinite case with "at most countable" in place of
"finite": (i) is replaced by [[lem-subset-of-countable]] itself, and (ii) by the
statement that a union of two at most countable sets is at most countable, which
is the two-set instance of [[thm-countable-union-of-countable]] applied to the
family $A_0 := U, A_1 := V, A_k := \varnothing$ for $k \ge 2$.

*Particular point.* (T1): $\varnothing$ is listed and $p \in X$. (T2): a
subfamily whose members are all $\varnothing$ has union $\varnothing$; otherwise
some member contains $p$, hence so does the union. (T3): if $U$ and $V$ both
contain $p$ then so does $U \cap V$; and if either is $\varnothing$ then so is the
intersection.

*Sierpinski.* The special case $X = \{a,b\}$, $p = b$ of the previous paragraph:
the sets containing $b$ are $\{b\}$ and $S$, so
$\mathcal{T}_b = \{\varnothing, \{b\}, S\} = \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{Sier}}$.

## Remarks

- **Two degenerate collapses.** If $X$ is finite then the cofinite topology is
  the discrete one, since every subset then has finite complement by fact (i)
  above; if $X$ is at most countable the cocountable topology is discrete for the
  same reason. Both families are therefore interesting only on an infinite,
  respectively uncountable, set, and every statement made about them below names
  that hypothesis.

- **Where the two extremes sit in the comparison order.** The discrete topology
  is the finest and the indiscrete the coarsest topology on $X$
  ([[def-topological-space]]): every topology is a subfamily of $\mathcal{P}(X)$
  and contains $\varnothing$ and $X$. Every other topology on $X$ lies between
  them, and the cofinite topology is coarser than the cocountable one, because a
  finite set is at most countable.

- **No choice principle is needed for any of the six, despite the citation.**
  The only appeal above that carries a choice hypothesis is
  [[thm-countable-union-of-countable]], whose statement assumes
  $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$, and it is used for a union of **two** sets only, padded
  with copies of $\varnothing$. That instance is provable in ZF alone, by
  interleaving two *given* enumerations, exactly as
  [[cor-irrationals-uncountable]] records for the union of the rationals and the
  irrationals; the general theorem is cited because it is the form in which this
  library states the union result, not because the strength is needed. Nothing
  about the cocountable topology depends on countable choice.

- **The Sierpinski point that is open is a genuine choice of labelling.** Both
  $\{\varnothing,\{b\},S\}$ and $\{\varnothing,\{a\},S\}$ are topologies, and they
  are carried to each other by the transposition of $a$ and $b$; this library
  fixes the first and always names the open point.

## Definition

Let $X$ be a set and write $\mathcal{P}(X)$ for its power set. A **topology** on
$X$ is a family $\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ such that

- **(T1)** $\varnothing \in \mathcal{T}$ and $X \in \mathcal{T}$;
- **(T2)** $\bigcup \mathcal{S} \in \mathcal{T}$ for every $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$;
- **(T3)** $U \cap V \in \mathcal{T}$ for all $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$.

A **topological space** is a pair $(X, \mathcal{T})$ consisting of a set $X$ and
a topology $\mathcal{T}$ on it; the elements of $X$ are its **points**. When only
one topology is in play we write $X$ for the pair; when several are, the topology
is always named.

The members of $\mathcal{T}$ are the **open** sets of $(X,\mathcal{T})$. A subset
$F \subseteq X$ is **closed** when its complement $X \setminus F$ is open, and
**clopen** when it is both open and closed. By (T1) both $\varnothing$ and $X$
are clopen. *Open and closed are not opposites*: a set may be neither, and it may
be both, so "not open" is never a synonym for "closed".

**Finite intersections, and the empty one.** Axiom (T3) is stated for two sets
because that is all that is ever needed: if $n \ge 1$ and
$U_1, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{T}$, then $U_1 \cap \dots \cap U_n \in \mathcal{T}$
follows by iterating (T3) $n-1$ times. The intersection of the **empty** family
of subsets of $X$ is $X$, since the condition "lies in every member of the empty
family" is vacuous; that case is covered by (T1) rather than by (T3), which is
one of the two reasons $X \in \mathcal{T}$ is demanded outright. The other is
that (T2) alone gives only $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$.

**The closed sets, and the dual axiomatisation.** Put
$\mathcal{C} := \{\, X \setminus U : U \in \mathcal{T} \,\}$, the family of closed
sets. Then

- **(C1)** $\varnothing \in \mathcal{C}$ and $X \in \mathcal{C}$;
- **(C2)** $\bigcap \mathcal{D} \in \mathcal{C}$ for every **nonempty**
  $\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$;
- **(C3)** $C \cup D \in \mathcal{C}$ for all $C, D \in \mathcal{C}$.

Conversely, if a family $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ satisfies (C1),
(C2) and (C3), then $\mathcal{T} := \{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{C} \,\}$
is a topology on $X$ whose closed sets are exactly the members of $\mathcal{C}$.
So a topology may be presented equally well by its open sets or by its closed
sets, and this library uses whichever is shorter.

*Both directions are one computation, and it is carried out here rather than
assumed.* The map $U \mapsto X \setminus U$ is an involution of
$\mathcal{P}(X)$, hence a bijection, and it carries the two De Morgan identities

$$X \setminus \bigcup_{i \in I} A_i = \bigcap_{i \in I} (X \setminus A_i) \quad (I \ne \varnothing), \qquad X \setminus \bigcap_{i \in I} A_i = \bigcup_{i \in I} (X \setminus A_i) \quad (I \ne \varnothing)$$

term by term into each other. Given (T1)–(T3): $\varnothing = X \setminus X$ and
$X = X \setminus \varnothing$ lie in $\mathcal{C}$, which is (C1); for nonempty
$\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$ the family
$\mathcal{S} = \{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{D} \,\}$ lies in $\mathcal{T}$
and $\bigcap \mathcal{D} = X \setminus \bigcup \mathcal{S}$ is closed by (T2),
which is (C2); and $C \cup D = X \setminus ((X \setminus C) \cap (X \setminus D))$
is closed by (T3), which is (C3). Given (C1)–(C3) the same three lines run
backwards, the empty-union case $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$ being supplied
by (C1) rather than by (C2); and $\{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{C} \,\}$ has
$\mathcal{C}$ as its family of complements because complementation is an
involution.

**Comparison of topologies.** If $\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ are
topologies on the same set $X$ and $\mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2$, then
$\mathcal{T}_1$ is **coarser** than $\mathcal{T}_2$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ is
**finer** than $\mathcal{T}_1$; the comparison is **strict** when the inclusion
is. Inclusion is a partial order on the set of topologies on $X$
([[def-partial-order]]), and it is not a total one: two topologies on the same
set may be incomparable.

## Remarks

- **The topology is part of the data.** Two different topologies on one set are
  two different topological spaces, exactly as two different metrics on one set
  are two different metric spaces. Every statement below that says "the space
  $X$" has a topology fixed in advance.

- **Nothing is assumed beyond (T1)–(T3).** In particular no separation property
  is built into the word *space* here: distinct points need not lie in disjoint
  open sets, singletons need not be closed, and both failures occur in the
  standard topologies defined on the next item. Where a separation property is
  used it is stated as a hypothesis.

- **This library always writes *coarser* and *finer*.** The synonyms
  *smaller/larger* are unambiguous, but *weaker/stronger* is used in both
  directions in the literature and is avoided here entirely.

- **Why "arbitrary unions, finite intersections" and not the reverse.** The
  asymmetry is not a convention: it is what makes the metric notion of open set
  ([[def-metric-topology]]) an instance, and an arbitrary intersection of open
  sets genuinely need not be open. The failure is recorded on this page as a
  false statement, with witnesses in two different spaces.

## Statement

The map $q \mapsto \hat q$ ([[def-real-numbers]]) is an embedding of ordered
fields. Every real is approximated by rationals: for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and
rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ with
$|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$. Consequently, strictly between any two
reals lies a rational.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real $x = [(a_n)]$ and a rational $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] The orders of $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}$; ordered-field arithmetic ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Field arithmetic in $\mathbb{Q}$: $\varepsilon/2, \delta/4$ are positive rationals, and every nonzero rational $q$ has a reciprocal $1/q$ with $q \cdot (1/q) = 1$ ([[thm-rat-field]]).

[L3] Cauchy definition ([[def-rational-cauchy-sequence]]).

[L4] Real positivity via eventual rational lower bounds ([[def-real-order]]).

[L5] $\mathbb{R} = \mathcal{C}/\mathcal{N}$ is a field ([[thm-reals-field]]), and $0_{\mathbb{R}} = \hat 0$, $1_{\mathbb{R}} = \hat 1$ are the classes of the constant sequences ([[def-real-numbers]]). A multiplicative inverse there is unique: if $ab = 1_{\mathbb{R}} = ac$ then $b = b(ac) = (ba)c = c$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Embedding: constant sequences are Cauchy; $\hat q = \hat r$ iff the constant $q - r$ is null iff $q = r$; operations match termwise; and $q < r$ gives the constant lower bound $r - q > 0$, so $\hat q < \hat r$ and order is preserved and reflected. [L1, L4]

1.2 Fix $N$ with $|a_m - a_n| < \varepsilon/2$ for all $m, n \ge N$, and set $q = a_N$. [L3, L2]

2.1 The difference $\hat q - x$ has representative $(a_N - a_n)$ with $|a_N - a_n| < \varepsilon/2$ for $n \ge N$; hence both $\hat\varepsilon - (x - \hat q)$ and $\hat\varepsilon - (\hat q - x)$ have representatives eventually $> \varepsilon/2$, so both are positive: $|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$. [step 1.2, L4, L1]

2.2 Inverses: let $q$ be a nonzero rational. Then $\hat q \ne \hat 0 = 0_{\mathbb{R}}$ by the injectivity of step 1.1, and $1/q$ exists in $\mathbb{Q}$ by [L2]; since the operations match termwise (step 1.1), $\hat q \cdot \widehat{1/q} = \widehat{q \cdot (1/q)} = \hat 1 = 1_{\mathbb{R}}$. Inverses in $\mathbb{R}$ are unique by [L5], so $(\hat q)^{-1} = \widehat{1/q}$: the embedding preserves reciprocals. [step 1.1, L2, L5]

3.1 Density: let $x < y$; pick $\delta > 0$ rational and $N$ with the representative of $y - x$ eventually $> \delta$; set $\varepsilon = \delta/4$ and pick $q$ with $|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$; then $q' = q + 2\varepsilon$ satisfies $\hat q' - x \ge -\hat\varepsilon + 2\hat\varepsilon = \hat\varepsilon > 0$ and $y - \hat q' \ge \hat\delta - \hat\varepsilon - 2\hat\varepsilon = \hat\delta/4 > 0$, so $x < \hat q' < y$. [step 2.1, L4, L1, L2]

4.1 The rationals embed as an ordered subfield — injectively, preserving the order in both directions, the ring operations, and reciprocals — and they approximate every real arbitrarily well and separate any two reals. [step 1.1, step 2.2, step 3.1] ∎

## Statement

Define $d_{\mathbb{R}} : \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ by
$d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) := |x - y|$ ([[def-abs-value]]). Then:

1. $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ is a metric on $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-metric-space]]); it is
   called the **usual metric** of $\mathbb{R}$.
2. For $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and $r > 0$ the open ball is the bounded open interval
   ([[def-interval]], [[def-metric-ball]])
   $$B(x,r) = (x-r,\ x+r),$$
   and the closed ball is $\bar B(x,r) = [x-r,\ x+r]$.
3. Consequently $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is open in the metric topology of
   $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-metric-topology]]) exactly when for every $x \in U$
   there is $r > 0$ with $(x-r, x+r) \subseteq U$. This topology is called the
   **usual topology** of $\mathbb{R}$.
4. $(\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$ is not a bounded metric space
   ([[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]): no ball contains $\mathbb{R}$, so
   $\operatorname{diam}(\mathbb{R})$ is not defined.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The complete ordered field $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]), and the function $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) = |x-y|$; points $x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}$ and a real $r > 0$.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| \ge 0$; $|u| = 0$ if and only if $u = 0$; $|-u| = |u|$; and for $c > 0$ one has $|u| < c$ if and only if $-c < u < c$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Triangle inequality in an ordered field: $|u + v| \le |u| + |v|$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L3] Intervals: $(a,b) = \{t : a < t < b\}$ and $[a,b] = \{t : a \le t \le b\}$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L4] Archimedean property: for every $w \in \mathbb{R}$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $w < n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); and $n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L5] Adding a constant to an inequality, in strict and nonstrict form: the strict form is [[lem-of-add-order]] and the nonstrict form is that together with the case of equality, the order being total ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L6] Trichotomy: for reals $a,b$ exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Separation (M1): $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) = |x-y| = 0$ holds if and only if $x - y = 0$, that is if and only if $x = y$. [L1]

1.2 Symmetry (M2): $d_{\mathbb{R}}(y,x) = |y-x| = |-(x-y)| = |x-y| = d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y)$. [L1]

1.3 Triangle inequality (M3): $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,z) = |x - z| = |(x-y) + (y-z)| \le |x-y| + |y-z| = d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) + d_{\mathbb{R}}(y,z)$. [L2]

1.4 For $y \in \mathbb{R}$ and $r > 0$: $y \in B(x,r)$ means $|x - y| < r$, which by [L1] holds if and only if $-r < x - y < r$, and adding $y - r$ respectively $y + r$ to the two halves shows this is equivalent to $x - r < y < x + r$. [L1, L5]

1.5 For $y \in \mathbb{R}$ and $r > 0$: $y \in \bar B(x,r)$ means $|x-y| \le r$, which by the same equivalence read with $\le$ in place of $<$ holds if and only if $x - r \le y \le x + r$. [L1, L5]

1.6 Let $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ and $r > 0$ be arbitrary, and use [L4] to fix a natural $n \ge 1$ with $x_0 + r < n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$; write $w := n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$. [L4, choose]

2.1 By steps 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 the function $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ satisfies (M1), (M2) and (M3), so it is a metric on $\mathbb{R}$, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3]

2.2 By step 1.4 and [L3] the set $B(x,r)$ has exactly the elements of $(x-r,x+r)$, and by step 1.5 and [L3] the set $\bar B(x,r)$ has exactly the elements of $[x-r,x+r]$; this is claim 2. [step 1.4, step 1.5, L3]

2.3 Since $r > 0$ we have $x_0 < x_0 + r < w$, so $w - x_0 > r > 0$ and hence $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x_0, w) = |x_0 - w| = |-(w - x_0)| = w - x_0 > r$; therefore $w \notin B(x_0,r)$. [step 1.6, L1, L5, L6]

3.1 Substituting claim 2 into the definition of open in the metric topology gives claim 3: $U$ is open exactly when every $x \in U$ admits $r > 0$ with $(x-r,x+r) = B(x,r) \subseteq U$. [step 2.2]

4.1 Since $x_0$ and $r$ were arbitrary, step 2.3 exhibits for every ball $B(x_0,r)$ a real not in it, so no ball contains $\mathbb{R}$; hence $\mathbb{R}$ is not a bounded subset of itself and $\operatorname{diam}(\mathbb{R})$ is not defined, which is claim 4. [step 2.1, step 2.3] ∎

## Remarks

- **This is the metric every later ceiling rests on.** Every real-line example on the companion page, and every subspace of $\mathbb{R}$ used there, takes its metric from $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ through the subspace construction of [[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]].
- **Unboundedness needs no Archimedean input, and no completeness either.** No ordered field is bounded under $d(u,v) = |u-v|$, and the reason is a single element rather than any cofinality property: given a centre $c$ and a radius $r > 0$, the element $c + r + 1$ satisfies $d(c,\, c + r + 1) = |{-(r+1)}| = r + 1 > r$, because $1 > 0$ and $r + 1 > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]]); so it lies outside $B(c,r)$ and no ball contains the field. Step 1.6 above chooses its witness with [[thm-of-archimedean]] instead, which is a convenience and not a necessity: it delivers a witness that is a canonical natural, and claim 4 needs no such thing. Claim 4 therefore holds verbatim in every ordered field with this $d$, Archimedean or not. Note also that a radius is an element of $\mathbb{R}$, so "a ball of infinite radius" is not something that can be written here.
- **The claim that $\operatorname{diam}(\mathbb{R})$ is "not defined" is a claim about the conventions of this development** ([[rem-sup-conventions]], [[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]): suprema here are real numbers and the extended real line, which is introduced on a later page, is not used for them, so an unbounded set has no diameter at all rather than a diameter $+\infty$.

## Statement

Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be topological spaces, let
$f : X \to Y$ be a function, and let $\mathcal{S}$ be a subbasis for
$\mathcal{T}_Y$ ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]). The following five conditions
are equivalent.

- **(a)** $f$ is continuous at every point of $X$ ([[def-continuous-map-top]]).
- **(b)** $f^{-1}[V]$ is open in $X$ for every open $V \subseteq Y$.
- **(c)** $f^{-1}[F]$ is closed in $X$ for every closed $F \subseteq Y$.
- **(d)** $f^{-1}[S]$ is open in $X$ for every $S \in \mathcal{S}$.
- **(e)** $f[\overline{A}] \subseteq \overline{f[A]}$ for every $A \subseteq X$,
  closures being taken in $X$ and in $Y$ respectively
  ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

Condition (d) is what makes continuity checkable against a generating family
rather than against every open set, and it holds for a *basis* as well, a basis
being in particular a subbasis for the topology it generates.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Topological spaces $(X,\mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y,\mathcal{T}_Y)$, a function $f : X \to Y$, a subbasis $\mathcal{S}$ for $\mathcal{T}_Y$, subsets $A \subseteq X$ and $V, F \subseteq Y$. Preimages satisfy $f^{-1}[Y \setminus W] = X \setminus f^{-1}[W]$, $f^{-1}[\bigcup_i W_i] = \bigcup_i f^{-1}[W_i]$ and $f^{-1}[\bigcap_i W_i] = \bigcap_i f^{-1}[W_i]$ for every family, with $f^{-1}[Y] = X$ for the empty intersection.

[A1] $f$ is continuous at $x$ when for every open $V \ni f(x)$ there is an open $U \ni x$ with $f[U] \subseteq V$ ([[def-continuous-map-top]]).

[A2] A set is closed exactly when its complement is open; a set is open exactly when it is a union of open sets containing each of its points ([[def-topological-space]]).

[L1] The topology generated by $\mathcal{S}$ has as a basis the family $\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S}}$ of intersections of finitely many members of $\mathcal{S}$, the empty intersection being $Y$; every open set is a union of members of $\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S}}$ ([[thm-basis-criterion]], [[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]).

[L2] $x \in \overline{A}$ if and only if every open set containing $x$ meets $A$ ([[thm-closure-characterisation-top]], clause (c)).

[L3] $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed superset of $A$, and $A$ is closed exactly when $A = \overline{A}$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 (a) implies (b): let $V \subseteq Y$ be open and let $x \in f^{-1}[V]$, so $f(x) \in V$; continuity at $x$ gives an open $U \ni x$ with $f[U] \subseteq V$, that is $U \subseteq f^{-1}[V]$. As $x$ was arbitrary, $f^{-1}[V]$ is a union of open sets, hence open. [A1, A2]

1.2 (b) implies (a): let $x \in X$ and let $V$ be open with $f(x) \in V$; then $U := f^{-1}[V]$ is open, contains $x$, and satisfies $f[U] \subseteq V$. [A1]

1.3 (b) and (c) are equivalent: $F \subseteq Y$ is closed exactly when $Y \setminus F$ is open, and $f^{-1}[Y \setminus F] = X \setminus f^{-1}[F]$, so $f^{-1}[F]$ is closed exactly when $f^{-1}[Y \setminus F]$ is open; as $F$ ranges over the closed sets, $Y \setminus F$ ranges over the open sets. [given, A2]

1.4 (b) implies (d): every $S \in \mathcal{S}$ is open, $\mathcal{S}$ being contained in the topology it generates. [L1]

1.5 (d) implies (b): let $V \subseteq Y$ be open; by [L1] $V$ is a union of sets of the form $S_1 \cap \dots \cap S_n$ with $n \ge 0$ and $S_i \in \mathcal{S}$, and $f^{-1}$ turns unions into unions and intersections into intersections, with $f^{-1}[Y] = X$ for $n = 0$; so $f^{-1}[V]$ is a union of finite intersections of the open sets $f^{-1}[S_i]$ together with $X$, hence open. [given, L1, A2]

1.6 (e) implies (c): let $F \subseteq Y$ be closed and put $A := f^{-1}[F]$; then $f[A] \subseteq F$, so $f[\overline{A}] \subseteq \overline{f[A]} \subseteq \overline{F} = F$ by (e), monotonicity of the closure and [L3]; hence $\overline{A} \subseteq f^{-1}[F] = A$, and with $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ this gives $A = \overline{A}$, so $A$ is closed. [L3]

2.1 (b) implies (e): let $A \subseteq X$ and $x \in \overline{A}$, and let $V$ be open with $f(x) \in V$; then $f^{-1}[V]$ is open and contains $x$, so it meets $A$ by [L2], say at $a$; then $f(a) \in V \cap f[A]$, so $V$ meets $f[A]$. As $V$ was arbitrary, $f(x) \in \overline{f[A]}$ by [L2]. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 Steps 1.1 and 1.2 make (a) and (b) equivalent; step 1.3 makes (b) and (c) equivalent; steps 1.4 and 1.5 make (b) and (d) equivalent; step 2.1 gives (b) implies (e) and step 1.6 gives (e) implies (c), which closes the cycle through (c) and (b). Hence all five conditions are equivalent. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, step 1.4, step 1.5, step 2.1, step 1.6] ∎

## Remarks

- **Only (a) is pointwise.** Conditions (b) to (e) are global, and none of them has a pointwise version that is equivalent to continuity at a single point: the preimage of an open set containing $f(x)$ can fail to be open while still being a neighbourhood of $x$, which is exactly what continuity at $x$ asserts.

- **The inclusion in (e) may be strict for a continuous map.** For the inclusion of $(0,1)$ into $\mathbb{R}$ and $A = (0,1)$, the image of the closure is $(0,1)$ while the closure of the image is $[0,1]$. Equality for all $A$ is a strictly stronger condition, equivalent to $f$ being a closed map, and closed maps are defined three items below. Note that no map into a **discrete** space can witness strictness: there every subset is closed, so $f[\overline{A}] = f[A] = \overline{f[A]}$ always.

- **What the theorem does not say.** It says nothing about images of open sets: a continuous map need not carry open sets to open sets, and the failure is exactly what separates a continuous bijection from a homeomorphism. That separation is recorded on this page as a false statement with an explicit two-point witness.
