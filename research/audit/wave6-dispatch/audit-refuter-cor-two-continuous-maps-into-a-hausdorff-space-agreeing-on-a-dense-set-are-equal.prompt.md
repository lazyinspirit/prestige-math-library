You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as a
read-only adversarial proof-refuter for the published-page audit. You are
tool-less: you cannot open a file, run a command, browse, edit, or delegate.
Everything you may rely on is reproduced in the `This dispatch` section. Return
evidence only; Audit-Alpha alone adjudicates and edits.

## Triage — the standing rule (verbatim, binding on you)

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct
  citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

## Adversarial standard

Read the target's title, Statement/Definition/Example/Statement refuted, Facts &
Assumptions, every numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks.
Try to falsify the public claim and every load-bearing inference.

1. Compare every cited fact with the supplied source text before alleging that
   it is weak. Check domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, direction, conclusion,
   and whether the source licenses the exact use.
2. Check that the title and public statement assert no more than the proof
   establishes, and that every proof step uses only available premises.
3. Check both directions of biconditionals, uniqueness/existence claims,
   induction and limiting arguments, empty/zero/endpoint/degenerate cases,
   extended-real conventions, index shifts, and hidden division or choice.
4. Re-read Remarks as skeptically as a numbered step. A false mathematical
   remark is a defect even when the proof is sound.
5. When the target is marked `ai-generated`, actively search for a
   counterexample to its claim, witness, or refutation rather than merely
   checking prose consistency.
6. Treat a false public claim, logically invalid proof, missing necessary
   hypothesis, circularity, or materially inaccurate load-bearing citation as
   fatal. Do not inflate an expository omission or a gap closable within thirty
   seconds into a defect.

## Output format

Reply with exactly this structure and no preamble:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

If `DEFECTS`, give one block per finding:

```text
FINDING 1
  location: [exact title, section, fact label, or numbered step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [the exact mathematical assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, missing hypothesis, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]
```

Then always end with:

```text
BOUNDARY: [specific boundary/counterexample checks and their disposition]
SOURCES:  [confirm every supplied cited item used by the target was inspected]
CHECKED:  [confirm the title, public claim, every numbered step, and Remarks were read]

## Statement

Let $Z$ be a topological space, let $D \subseteq Z$ be dense
([[def-dense-top]]), let $Y$ be Hausdorff ([[def-hausdorff-space]]) and let
$f, g : Z \to Y$ be continuous ([[def-continuous-map-top]]) with

$$f(d) = g(d) \qquad \text{for every } d \in D .$$

Then $f = g$.

So a continuous map into a Hausdorff space is determined by its restriction to
any dense subset of its domain. Nothing is asserted about *which* functions on
$D$ extend: the statement is about uniqueness of an extension, not existence.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A topological space $Z$, a dense subset $D \subseteq Z$, a Hausdorff space $Y$, and continuous maps $f, g : Z \to Y$ agreeing at every point of $D$.

[A1] $D$ is dense in $Z$, that is $\overline{D} = Z$ ([[def-dense-top]]).

[L1] The agreement set $E(f,g) = \{\, z \in Z : f(z) = g(z) \,\}$ is closed in $Z$ ([[cor-the-agreement-set-of-two-maps-into-a-hausdorff-space-is-closed]], [[def-hausdorff-space]], [[def-continuous-map-top]]).

[L2] $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed superset of $A$: it is contained in every closed set containing $A$ ([[thm-closure-characterisation-top]], claim 2, [[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $E(f,g)$ is closed in $Z$. [L1]

1.2 $D \subseteq E(f,g)$, since $f$ and $g$ agree at every point of $D$. [given]

2.1 $Z = \overline{D} \subseteq E(f,g)$, the equality by [A1] and the inclusion because $E(f,g)$ is a closed set containing $D$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, A1, L2]

3.1 $E(f,g) \subseteq Z$ holds by definition, so $E(f,g) = Z$, that is $f(z) = g(z)$ for every $z \in Z$ and $f = g$. [step 2.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The Hausdorff hypothesis is spent exactly once**, inside [L1], and the density hypothesis exactly once, at step 2.1. Neither is used anywhere else, and neither can be weakened to the other: a dense agreement set alone does not force equality without a separation hypothesis on the codomain, and a Hausdorff codomain alone plainly does not.

- **Density is a hypothesis about $Z$, not about $Y$.** In particular the statement is about one domain and one dense subset of it; it says nothing about restrictions to subsets that are merely large in some other sense, and there is no cardinality condition anywhere in it.

- **The uniqueness/existence split matters.** A continuous $f : D \to Y$ need not extend continuously to $Z$ at all. What this corollary rules out is *two different* extensions, and that is exactly what makes an extension, when it exists, worth naming.

## Statement

Let $Z$ be a topological space, let $Y$ be a Hausdorff space
([[def-hausdorff-space]]) and let $f, g : Z \to Y$ be continuous
([[def-continuous-map-top]]). Then the **agreement set**

$$E(f,g) \;:=\; \{\, z \in Z : f(z) = g(z) \,\}$$

is closed in $Z$.

No hypothesis is placed on $Z$: the separation hypothesis is on the **codomain**
alone, and it is not decoration. Let $Y_0 = \{a,b\}$ with $a \ne b$ carry the
indiscrete topology ([[def-standard-topologies]]), which is not Hausdorff. Every
function $Z \to Y_0$ is continuous, the only preimages to check being those of
$\varnothing$ and $Y_0$, namely $\varnothing$ and $Z$. So for **any** subset
$S \subseteq Z$ the constant map $f_0 \equiv a$ and the map $g_0$ taking the
value $a$ on $S$ and $b$ off $S$ are continuous with $E(f_0,g_0) = S$, closed or
not.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Topological spaces $Z$ and $Y$ with $Y$ Hausdorff, continuous maps $f, g : Z \to Y$, and the product $Y \times Y$ with the product topology.

[A1] $E(f,g) = \langle f, g \rangle^{-1}[\Delta_Y]$, where $\langle f, g \rangle : Z \to Y \times Y$ is the pairing and $\Delta_Y$ the diagonal ([[def-the-diagonal-of-a-space]]).

[L1] The pairing $\langle f, g \rangle$ is continuous whenever $f$ and $g$ are ([[lem-the-diagonal-map-is-an-embedding]], claim 1).

[L2] $\Delta_Y$ is closed in $Y \times Y$, since $Y$ is Hausdorff ([[thm-hausdorff-iff-the-diagonal-is-closed]], [[def-hausdorff-space]]).

[L3] A map is continuous if and only if the preimage of every closed set is closed ([[thm-continuity-characterisations-top]], clauses (a) and (c), [[def-continuous-map-top]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $\langle f, g \rangle : Z \to Y \times Y$ is continuous. [L1]

1.2 $\Delta_Y$ is closed in $Y \times Y$. [L2]

2.1 $E(f,g) = \langle f, g \rangle^{-1}[\Delta_Y]$ is the preimage of a closed set under a continuous map, hence closed in $Z$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, A1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the diagonal criterion is the right tool here.** The condition "$f(z) = g(z)$" is a condition on the *pair* of values, so it becomes a membership condition once the two maps are packaged into one map into the square; the criterion then converts the separation hypothesis on $Y$ into the closedness of the set that condition names. Nothing is proved twice: the whole content is [[thm-hausdorff-iff-the-diagonal-is-closed]] together with the preimage identity of [[def-the-diagonal-of-a-space]].

- **Both hypotheses are used, and only these.** Continuity of $f$ and $g$ enters only through [L1], and the Hausdorff condition only through [L2]. In particular no countability, compactness or separation hypothesis on $Z$ appears anywhere in the argument.

- **The complement is what the statement is often used for.** $Z \setminus E(f,g)$ is open, so if $f$ and $g$ differ at a point they differ throughout some open neighbourhood of it. Equivalently, $E(f,g)$ contains the closure of every subset of $Z$ on which $f$ and $g$ agree, which is the form in which a statement about a dense set is obtained from this one.

## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be topological spaces
([[def-topological-space]]), let $f : X \to Y$ be a function and let $x \in X$.
Neighbourhoods are as in [[def-neighbourhood-top]].

$f$ is **continuous at $x$** if for every neighbourhood $V$ of $f(x)$ in $Y$ the
preimage $f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ in $X$.

$f$ is **continuous** if it is continuous at every point of $X$.

**The same condition with open sets only.** $f$ is continuous at $x$ if and only
if for every open $V \subseteq Y$ with $f(x) \in V$ there is an open
$U \subseteq X$ with $x \in U$ and $f[U] \subseteq V$. Indeed, if $f$ is
continuous at $x$ and $V$ is such an open set, then $V$ is a neighbourhood of
$f(x)$, so $f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ and contains an open $U \ni x$,
which satisfies $f[U] \subseteq V$. Conversely, given the displayed condition and
a neighbourhood $V$ of $f(x)$, fix open $V_0$ with $f(x) \in V_0 \subseteq V$ and
then open $U \ni x$ with $f[U] \subseteq V_0$; then $x \in U \subseteq f^{-1}[V_0] \subseteq f^{-1}[V]$,
so $f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$. Both forms are used below and are the
same statement written twice.

**Preimage, not image.** $f^{-1}[V] = \{\, x \in X : f(x) \in V \,\}$
is the preimage in the sense of [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]] and is
defined for every function, invertible or not; no inverse function is being
asserted to exist. Continuity is a condition on preimages throughout, and the
corresponding conditions on images define the *open* and *closed* maps of a later
item, which are different notions.

## Remarks

- **This is the metric definition when both topologies are metric topologies.**
  For metric spaces, $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ continuity at $a$
  ([[def-metric-continuity]]) says that every ball around $f(a)$ has a ball
  around $a$ mapped into it, and the balls around a point are a neighbourhood
  base there; the identification is carried out where metrizable spaces are
  defined later on this page. Nothing about a metric survives in the definition
  above: continuity is a relation between two topologies and a function, and it
  is meaningless to ask whether a function between bare sets is continuous.

- **Continuity depends on both topologies, and coarsening the target or refining
  the source only helps.** If $f$ is continuous and $\mathcal{T}_X$ is replaced
  by a finer topology, or $\mathcal{T}_Y$ by a coarser one, $f$ remains
  continuous, since each condition to be verified is weakened and each
  neighbourhood available in the source is still available. In particular every
  map out of a discrete space and every map into an indiscrete space is
  continuous ([[def-standard-topologies]]).

- **Continuity at a point is strictly weaker than continuity.** A function may be
  continuous at exactly one point, and the definition above is deliberately local
  so that the sequential criteria proved later can be stated pointwise.

## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, let $\mathcal{B}$ be a basis for
$\mathcal{T}$ ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]) and let $A \subseteq X$. Interior
and closure are as in [[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]].

- $A$ is **dense** in $X$ if $\overline{A} = X$.
- $A$ is **codense** in $X$ if $X \setminus A$ is dense.
- $A$ is **nowhere dense** in $X$ if $\operatorname{int}(\overline{A}) = \varnothing$.

**Three equivalent forms of density, and the one used in practice.** The
following are equivalent:

1. $\overline{A} = X$;
2. $U \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every nonempty open $U \subseteq X$;
3. $B \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every nonempty $B \in \mathcal{B}$.

*Proof.* (1) $\Rightarrow$ (2): if $U$ is open and nonempty, pick $x \in U$; then
$x \in \overline{A}$, so $U \cap A \ne \varnothing$ by clause (c) of
[[thm-closure-characterisation-top]]. (2) $\Rightarrow$ (3): a nonempty member of
$\mathcal{B}$ is a nonempty open set. (3) $\Rightarrow$ (1): let $x \in X$; every
$B \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B$ is nonempty and so meets $A$, hence
$x \in \overline{A}$ by clause (d) of [[thm-closure-characterisation-top]]. Form
3 is what makes density checkable: for the Sorgenfrey line it is a statement
about half-open intervals, and for a metric space a statement about balls.

**Codensity is emptiness of the interior.** $A$ is codense if and only if
$\operatorname{int}(A) = \varnothing$, because
$X \setminus \operatorname{int}(A) = \overline{X \setminus A}$
([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]), so $\overline{X \setminus A} = X$ holds
exactly when $\operatorname{int}(A) = \varnothing$.

**Nowhere dense implies codense, and the converse fails.** If
$\operatorname{int}(\overline{A}) = \varnothing$ then
$\operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq \operatorname{int}(\overline{A}) = \varnothing$
by monotonicity of the interior, so $A$ is codense. The two notions can differ
only on sets whose closure is larger than themselves, and there they sometimes
do: a dense set with empty interior, such as the rationals inside the real line,
is codense and is not nowhere dense, its closure being everything. They may also
agree on such a set: $(0,1)$ inside $\mathbb{R}$ has closure $[0,1]$ and is
neither codense nor nowhere dense. A *closed* set is nowhere dense
precisely when it is codense, since then $\overline{A} = A$.

## Remarks

- **Density is a property of the pair, not of the set.** A subset dense in $X$
  need not be dense in a space with a finer topology. In a nonempty indiscrete
  space every nonempty subset is dense, while $\varnothing$ is not; in the empty
  space $\varnothing$ is dense as well. Where a density claim is made below the
  topology is always named.

- **The empty set.** $\varnothing$ is nowhere dense and codense in every space,
  and it is dense only in $X = \varnothing$. $X$ itself is dense in $X$ and is
  nowhere dense only when $X = \varnothing$.

- **What is deliberately not defined here.** Separability, meaning the existence
  of an at most countable dense subset, is a countability axiom not developed at
  this point in the reading order; it is defined later in
  [[def-separable-space]]. Where a space on the companion page has an at most
  countable dense subset, that is what is said in full.

## Definition

A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ ([[def-topological-space]]) is
**Hausdorff** when any two distinct points are separated by disjoint open sets:
for all $x, y \in X$ with $x \ne y$ there are $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$ with

$$x \in U, \qquad y \in V, \qquad U \cap V = \varnothing .$$

Since an open set containing a point is an open neighbourhood of it
([[def-neighbourhood-top]]), the condition reads: distinct points have disjoint
open neighbourhoods. Nothing is asserted about points that are equal, and the
condition is vacuous for a space with at most one point, so every such space is
Hausdorff.

**Every metrizable space is Hausdorff.** This is not proved here, because it is
already discharged: [[def-metrizable-space]] records it among the two things
every metrizable space has, deriving it from
[[thm-metric-hausdorff-separation]], which separates $p \ne q$ in a metric space
by the disjoint open balls $B(p,r)$ and $B(q,r)$ with $r = d(p,q)/2 > 0$. In
particular $\mathbb{R}$ with its usual topology, every $\mathbb{R}^n$, and every
subspace of a metrizable space are Hausdorff.

**Not every space is Hausdorff.** The indiscrete topology
$\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{ind}} = \{\varnothing, X\}$ on a set $X = \{a,b\}$ with
$a \ne b$ ([[def-standard-topologies]]) is not: the only open set containing $a$
is $X$, the only one containing $b$ is $X$, and $X \cap X = X \ne \varnothing$.
This is the same two-point space that [[def-metrizable-space]] uses to exhibit a
topology induced by no metric, and the reason is the same one: failure of the
Hausdorff condition is an obstruction to metrizability.

**Being Hausdorff is a topological property** ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]).
If $h : X \to Z$ is a homeomorphism and $X$ is Hausdorff, then for $z \ne z'$ in
$Z$ the points $h^{-1}(z)$ and $h^{-1}(z')$ are distinct, so they have disjoint
open $U, V$; the images $h[U]$ and $h[V]$ are open, disjoint, and contain $z$ and
$z'$ respectively, a homeomorphism carrying the open sets of one space
bijectively onto those of the other. So no space homeomorphic to a Hausdorff
space fails the condition.

**Scope of this item.** Only the definition, the metrizable case and the
two-point failure are recorded here, because that is all this page uses. The
Hausdorff condition is one of a graded family of separation axioms; that family,
its ordering, and the questions of which of its members are hereditary or
preserved by products, are not available at this point in the reading order and
nothing here anticipates them. What this page does use is a single negative
result: a quotient of a Hausdorff space need not be Hausdorff, which is recorded
below as a false statement and witnessed on the companion page.

## Remarks

- **Hausdorff spaces have closed singletons.** Fix $x \in X$ and take the union
  of all open subsets of $X$ that avoid $x$. Every $y \ne x$ belongs to one of
  them, by Hausdorff separation of $x$ and $y$, while $x$ belongs to none. The
  union is therefore exactly $X \setminus \{x\}$, so $\{x\}$ is closed.
  Thus the Hausdorff property implies the singleton-closed ($T_1$) property.
  The converse fails: closed singletons need not give disjoint neighbourhoods
  of distinct points.

- **What the Hausdorff condition buys, in the one place this page needs it.**
  Separation of distinct points by disjoint open sets is exactly what a quotient
  map can destroy: identifying points of a Hausdorff space can leave two classes
  every pair of whose open neighbourhoods meet, and the companion page exhibits
  such a quotient of a metrizable space. Nothing weaker than an explicit witness
  settles that, since the condition is a statement about all pairs of open sets.

- **The name.** Hausdorff's own 1914 axiom system for a topological space
  included this condition, so "topological space" once meant what is now called a
  Hausdorff space; this library follows the modern convention in which
  [[def-topological-space]] assumes no separation at all and every separation
  hypothesis is stated where it is used.

## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]), let
$A \subseteq X$ and let $x \in X$. Neighbourhoods are as in
[[def-neighbourhood-top]], so a neighbourhood need not be open.

- The **interior** of $A$ is
  $\operatorname{int}(A) := \bigcup \{\, U \in \mathcal{T} : U \subseteq A \,\}$.
- The **closure** of $A$ is
  $\overline{A} := \bigcap \{\, F \subseteq X : F \text{ closed and } A \subseteq F \,\}$.
- The **exterior** of $A$ is $\operatorname{ext}(A) := \operatorname{int}(X \setminus A)$.
- The **boundary** of $A$ is $\partial A := \overline{A} \setminus \operatorname{int}(A)$.
- $x$ is a **limit point** (accumulation point) of $A$ if every neighbourhood $N$
  of $x$ satisfies $N \cap (A \setminus \{x\}) \ne \varnothing$. The set of limit
  points of $A$ is the **derived set** $A'$.
- $x$ is an **isolated point of $A$** if $x \in A$ and some neighbourhood $N$ of
  $x$ satisfies $N \cap A = \{x\}$.

**Both operators are well posed, and the two names are justified rather than
asserted.** The interior is a union of open sets, hence open by (T2), it is
contained in $A$, and it contains every open $U \subseteq A$: so
$\operatorname{int}(A)$ is *the largest open subset of $A$*. The family being
intersected in the definition of $\overline{A}$ is nonempty, since $X$ is closed
and contains $A$, so the intersection is a set; it is closed by (C2) of
[[def-topological-space]], it contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed
$F \supseteq A$: so $\overline{A}$ is *the smallest closed superset of $A$*. In
particular

$$\operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq A \subseteq \overline{A},$$

and $A$ is open if and only if $A = \operatorname{int}(A)$, and closed if and
only if $A = \overline{A}$, in each case because one inclusion is automatic and
the other says exactly that $A$ belongs to the family in question.

**Interior and closure are exchanged by complementation.** For every
$A \subseteq X$,

$$X \setminus \operatorname{int}(A) = \overline{X \setminus A}, \qquad X \setminus \overline{A} = \operatorname{int}(X \setminus A) = \operatorname{ext}(A).$$

Indeed $U \mapsto X \setminus U$ is a bijection between the open subsets of $A$
and the closed supersets of $X \setminus A$, and it turns unions into
intersections ([[def-topological-space]]); applying complementation to the first
identity gives the second. So $\operatorname{ext}(A) = X \setminus \overline{A}$,
and every statement about interiors has a mirror statement about closures.

**The pointwise description of the interior.** $x \in \operatorname{int}(A)$ if
and only if $A$ is a neighbourhood of $x$. If $x \in \operatorname{int}(A)$ then
$\operatorname{int}(A)$ is an open set with $x \in \operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq A$;
conversely a neighbourhood relation $x \in U \subseteq A$ with $U$ open puts $x$
in the union defining $\operatorname{int}(A)$. The corresponding description of
the closure is proved as the next item, because it is the statement that does the
work in every later proof.

**$X$ is the disjoint union of the three regions.** Since
$\operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq \overline{A}$, the three sets
$\operatorname{int}(A)$, $\partial A = \overline{A} \setminus \operatorname{int}(A)$
and $\operatorname{ext}(A) = X \setminus \overline{A}$ are pairwise disjoint and
their union is $X$. This is recorded again, with the identities for interior and
closure of unions and intersections, in the lemma two items below.

## Remarks

- **The boundary is symmetric in $A$ and its complement**:
  $\partial A = \overline{A} \cap \overline{X \setminus A}$, because
  $\overline{A} \setminus \operatorname{int}(A) = \overline{A} \cap (X \setminus \operatorname{int}(A)) = \overline{A} \cap \overline{X \setminus A}$
  by the complementation identity above. Hence $\partial A = \partial(X \setminus A)$,
  and $\partial A$ is closed, being an intersection of two closed sets.

- **A limit point of $A$ need not lie in $A$, and a point of $A$ need not be a
  limit point of $A$.** The points of $A$ that are not limit points of $A$ are
  exactly its isolated points, directly from the two definitions. The relation
  $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$ is a theorem, proved next, not a restatement.

- **These are the metric notions when the topology is a metric topology.** For a
  metric space the definitions of [[def-metric-interior-closure-boundary]] are
  stated with balls in place of neighbourhoods, and the balls around $x$ are a
  neighbourhood base at $x$; the identification is carried out where metrizable
  spaces are defined, later on this page, and it is what allows metric examples
  to be quoted here without reproof.

## Statement

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, let $\mathcal{B}$ be a basis for
$\mathcal{T}$ ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]), let $A \subseteq X$ and let
$x \in X$. Closure, derived set and limit points are as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]. Then:

1. The following four conditions are equivalent.
   - (a) $x \in \overline{A}$;
   - (b) $N \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every neighbourhood $N$ of $x$
     ([[def-neighbourhood-top]]);
   - (c) $U \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every open $U$ with $x \in U$;
   - (d) $B \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every $B \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B$.
2. $\overline{A}$ is closed, contains $A$, and is contained in every closed
   $F \subseteq X$ with $A \subseteq F$; so it is the smallest closed superset of
   $A$, and $A$ is closed if and only if $A = \overline{A}$.
3. $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$.

Claim 2 is recorded here for reference and is discharged in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]], where it is what makes the definition of
$\overline{A}$ well posed; claims 1 and 3 are proved below. Claim 1 is the form in
which the closure is used everywhere afterwards, and clause (d) is what makes a
closure computable from a basis rather than from all open sets.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A topological space $(X,\mathcal{T})$, a basis $\mathcal{B}$ for $\mathcal{T}$, a subset $A \subseteq X$ and a point $x \in X$.

[A1] $\overline{A}$ is the intersection of all closed supersets of $A$; it is closed, contains $A$, and is contained in every closed superset of $A$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

[A2] $x \in A'$ means that $N \cap (A \setminus \{x\}) \ne \varnothing$ for every neighbourhood $N$ of $x$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

[L1] $N$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ when $x \in U \subseteq N$ for some open $U$; an open set containing $x$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ ([[def-neighbourhood-top]]).

[L2] $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for $\mathcal{T}$: for every open $U$ and every $x \in U$ there is $B \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B \subseteq U$, and every member of $\mathcal{B}$ is open ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]).

[L3] A set is closed exactly when its complement is open ([[def-topological-space]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 (a) implies (c): let $U$ be open with $x \in U$ and suppose $U \cap A = \varnothing$; then $X \setminus U$ is closed and contains $A$, so $\overline{A} \subseteq X \setminus U$ by [A1], whence $x \notin \overline{A}$, contradicting (a); therefore $U \cap A \ne \varnothing$. [A1, L3]

1.2 (c) implies (a): suppose $x \notin \overline{A}$; then $U := X \setminus \overline{A}$ is open by [A1] and [L3], contains $x$, and satisfies $U \cap A = \varnothing$ because $A \subseteq \overline{A}$, so (c) fails. [A1, L3]

1.3 (b) implies (c): an open $U$ containing $x$ is a neighbourhood of $x$, so (b) applies to it. [L1]

1.4 (c) implies (b): let $N$ be a neighbourhood of $x$ and fix open $U$ with $x \in U \subseteq N$; then $\varnothing \ne U \cap A \subseteq N \cap A$. [L1]

1.5 (c) implies (d): every $B \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B$ is an open set containing $x$. [L2]

1.6 (d) implies (c): let $U$ be open with $x \in U$ and fix $B \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B \subseteq U$; then $\varnothing \ne B \cap A \subseteq U \cap A$. [L2]

1.7 $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ and $\overline{A}$ is closed, and $\overline{A}$ is contained in every closed superset of $A$, which is claim 2; in particular $A$ is closed exactly when $A = \overline{A}$, since one inclusion always holds and the other says that $A$ is a closed superset of itself. [A1, L3]

2.1 By steps 1.1 to 1.6 the four conditions (a), (b), (c) and (d) are equivalent, which is claim 1: (a) and (c) are equivalent by steps 1.1 and 1.2, (b) and (c) by steps 1.3 and 1.4, and (c) and (d) by steps 1.5 and 1.6. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6]

3.1 $A \cup A' \subseteq \overline{A}$: points of $A$ lie in $\overline{A}$ by [A1], and if $x \in A'$ then every neighbourhood $N$ of $x$ meets $A \setminus \{x\}$ and hence meets $A$, so $x \in \overline{A}$ by condition (b). [step 2.1, A1, A2]

3.2 $\overline{A} \subseteq A \cup A'$: let $x \in \overline{A}$ and suppose $x \notin A$; then for every neighbourhood $N$ of $x$ condition (b) gives $N \cap A \ne \varnothing$, and $A = A \setminus \{x\}$ because $x \notin A$, so $N \cap (A \setminus \{x\}) \ne \varnothing$ and $x \in A'$. [step 2.1, A2]

4.1 Steps 3.1 and 3.2 give $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$, which is claim 3; with step 2.1 for claim 1 and step 1.7 for claim 2 the theorem is proved. [step 1.7, step 2.1, step 3.1, step 3.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Clause (d) is relative to a basis and clause (c) is not.** Different bases for one topology give different families of test sets in (d), and the theorem says all of them detect the same closure. This is why a closure in a metric space may be computed with balls alone, and a closure in $\mathbb{R}$ with bounded open intervals alone.

- **The empty set and the whole space.** $\overline{\varnothing} = \varnothing$, since $\varnothing$ is closed, and $\overline{X} = X$; claim 1 reads correctly in both cases, no neighbourhood meeting $\varnothing$ and every neighbourhood meeting $X$.

- **Nothing here assumes that singletons are closed.** In the indiscrete topology on a set with at least two points, $\overline{\{x\}} = X$ for every $x$, since the only neighbourhood of any point is $X$; claim 3 then says $A' = X \setminus \{x\}$ is contained in $\overline{\{x\}}$, which it is.
