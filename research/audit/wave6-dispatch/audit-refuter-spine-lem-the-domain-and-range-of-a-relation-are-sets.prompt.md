You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as a
read-only adversarial proof-refuter for the published-page audit. You are
tool-less: you cannot open a file, run a command, browse, edit, or delegate.
Everything you may rely on is reproduced in the `This dispatch` section. Return
evidence only; Audit-Alpha alone adjudicates and edits.

## Triage — the standing rule (verbatim, binding on you)

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct
  citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

## Adversarial standard

Read the target's title, Statement/Definition/Example/Statement refuted, Facts &
Assumptions, every numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks.
Try to falsify the public claim and every load-bearing inference.

1. Compare every cited fact with the supplied source text before alleging that
   it is weak. Check domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, direction, conclusion,
   and whether the source licenses the exact use.
2. Check that the title and public statement assert no more than the proof
   establishes, and that every proof step uses only available premises.
3. Check both directions of biconditionals, uniqueness/existence claims,
   induction and limiting arguments, empty/zero/endpoint/degenerate cases,
   extended-real conventions, index shifts, and hidden division or choice.
4. Re-read Remarks as skeptically as a numbered step. A false mathematical
   remark is a defect even when the proof is sound.
5. When the target is marked `ai-generated`, actively search for a
   counterexample to its claim, witness, or refutation rather than merely
   checking prose consistency.
6. Treat a false public claim, logically invalid proof, missing necessary
   hypothesis, circularity, or materially inaccurate load-bearing citation as
   fatal. Do not inflate an expository omission or a gap closable within thirty
   seconds into a defect.

## Output format

Reply with exactly this structure and no preamble:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

If `DEFECTS`, give one block per finding:

```text
FINDING 1
  location: [exact title, section, fact label, or numbered step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [the exact mathematical assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, missing hypothesis, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]
```

Then always end with:

```text
BOUNDARY: [specific boundary/counterexample checks and their disposition]
SOURCES:  [confirm every supplied cited item used by the target was inspected]
CHECKED:  [confirm the title, public claim, every numbered step, and Remarks were read]

## Statement

Let $R$ be a set every element of which is an ordered pair. Then the classes

$$\{\, a : \exists b\ (a,b) \in R \,\} \quad\text{and}\quad \{\, b : \exists a\ (a,b) \in R \,\}$$

are sets, and both are included in $\bigcup\bigcup R$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** a set $R$ every element of which is an ordered pair.

[L1] $(a,b) := \{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$ ([[def-ordered-pair]]).

[L2] $\{x,y\}$ is the set whose elements are exactly $x$ and $y$, and $\{x\} := \{x,x\}$ ([[def-unordered-pair-and-singleton]]).

[L3] $\bigcup x$ is the set whose elements are exactly the elements of the elements of $x$ ([[def-union-of-a-set-and-binary-union]]).

[L4] For any parameters $\bar p$ and any set $x$, there is a set $y$ whose elements are exactly the elements $z$ of $x$ for which $\varphi(z,\bar p)$ holds ([[def-axiom-schema-of-separation]]).

[L5] $x \subseteq y$ means that every element of $x$ is an element of $y$ ([[def-subset-and-proper-subset]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $(a,b) \in R$. The elements of $(a,b)$ are $\{a\}$ and $\{a,b\}$, and $(a,b)$ is an element of $R$, so $\{a\}$ and $\{a,b\}$ are elements of $\bigcup R$. [L1, L2, L3]

2.1 The elements of $\{a\}$ and of $\{a,b\}$ are elements of $\bigcup\bigcup R$; hence $a \in \bigcup\bigcup R$ and $b \in \bigcup\bigcup R$ whenever $(a,b) \in R$. [L2, L3, step 1.1]

3.1 Separation applied to $\bigcup\bigcup R$ with the formula $\exists b\,((a,b) \in R)$ and the parameter $R$ gives the set $\{\, a \in \bigcup\bigcup R : \exists b\ (a,b) \in R \,\}$; by step 2.1 every $a$ satisfying that formula already lies in $\bigcup\bigcup R$, so this set has exactly the elements of the first class. The second class is obtained the same way from the formula $\exists a\,((a,b) \in R)$. [L4, L5, step 2.1] ∎

## Definition

Let $\varphi(z, \bar p)$ be a formula of the language of set theory
([[def-language-of-set-theory]]) in which the variable $y$ does not occur free.
The **Separation instance** for $\varphi$ is the sentence

$$\forall \bar p\,\forall x\,\exists y\,\forall z\,\bigl(z \in y \leftrightarrow (z \in x \wedge \varphi(z,\bar p))\bigr).$$

The **Axiom Schema of Separation** is the collection of all these sentences, one
for each such $\varphi$. In words: for any parameters $\bar p$ and any set $x$,
there is a set $y$ whose elements are exactly the elements $z$ of $x$ for which
$\varphi(z,\bar p)$ holds.

It is a schema and not a single axiom because $\varphi$ ranges over the formulas
of the language, of which there are infinitely many, and the language provides no
way to quantify over them.

## Remarks

- **The side condition is not decoration.** If $y$ were allowed to occur free in
  $\varphi$, the instance $\varphi(z,\bar p) := z \notin y$ would assert that
  some $y$ satisfies $z \in y \leftrightarrow (z \in x \wedge z \notin y)$ for
  every $z$, which is contradictory as soon as $x$ has a member. Requiring $y$ to
  be fresh is what keeps the schema consistent.

- **One parameter or a list.** Some presentations state the schema with a single
  parameter $p$ rather than a list $\bar p$; the two forms prove the same
  theorems, since a finite list can be coded once ordered pairs are available.
  The list form is used here because the instances below quantify over several
  sets at once.

- **A separated set is unique.** The instance is stated with $\leftrightarrow$,
  so any two sets it produces have the same elements and are equal by
  [[def-axiom-of-extensionality]]. That is what licenses the notation
  $\{\, z \in x : \varphi(z,\bar p) \,\}$ introduced at
  [[def-subset-and-proper-subset]].

## Definition

For sets $a$ and $b$, the **ordered pair** $(a,b)$ is the set

$$(a,b) := \{\{a\},\{a,b\}\},$$

formed from the unordered pairs and singletons of
[[def-unordered-pair-and-singleton]]; three applications of
[[def-axiom-of-pairing]] produce it. The first coordinate is $a$ and the second
is $b$.

When $a = b$ the two members coincide, since $\{a,b\} = \{a,a\} = \{a\}$, and the
pair degenerates to $(a,a) = \{\{a\}\}$.

## Remarks

- **Why this set and not another.** An ordered pair is required to satisfy one
  property, that $(a,b) = (c,d)$ exactly when $a = c$ and $b = d$; that is
  [[thm-the-characterising-property-of-ordered-pairs]], and it is the only thing
  any later construction uses. Other definitions with the same property exist,
  and nothing below distinguishes them from this one.

- **The degenerate case is where a careless proof fails.** An argument that
  treats $\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$ as a set with two distinct members breaks at
  $a = b$, and that case has to be handled separately in the proof of the
  characterising property.

## Definition

For sets $x$ and $y$ we write $x \subseteq y$, and say that $x$ is a **subset**
of $y$ or that $x$ is **included** in $y$, for the formula
$\forall t\,(t \in x \to t \in y)$ of the language of set theory
([[def-language-of-set-theory]]); thus $x \subseteq y$ means that every element
of $x$ is an element of $y$. We also write $y \supseteq x$ for $x \subseteq y$.

$x$ is a **proper subset** of $y$, written $x \subsetneq y$, when $x \subseteq y$
and $x \neq y$.

**Separation notation.** Let $x$ be a set, $\varphi(z,\bar p)$ a formula and
$\bar p$ parameters. [[def-axiom-schema-of-separation]] supplies a set whose
elements are exactly the elements $z$ of $x$ for which $\varphi(z,\bar p)$ holds,
and [[def-axiom-of-extensionality]] shows there is only one such set. It is
written

$$\{\, z \in x : \varphi(z,\bar p) \,\}$$

and every set introduced on this page by separating a condition inside a set
already in hand is written this way. Directly from the definition,
$\{\, z \in x : \varphi(z,\bar p) \,\} \subseteq x$.

## Remarks

- **$\subset$ is not used in this library.** Sources disagree about it: some write
  $\subset$ for inclusion and some for proper inclusion, so a formula containing
  it cannot be read without knowing which convention its author used.
  $\subseteq$ and $\subsetneq$ are unambiguous and are the only two symbols used
  here.

- **Membership and inclusion are different relations.** $t \in x$ says $t$ is one
  of the elements of $x$; $t \subseteq x$ says every element of $t$ is an element
  of $x$. Neither implies the other in general, and
  [[prop-basic-properties-of-the-power-set]] is where the two are systematically
  related.

## Definition

Let $x$ be a set. [[def-axiom-of-union]] gives a set whose elements are exactly
the sets $z$ belonging to some member of $x$, and [[def-axiom-of-extensionality]]
shows there is only one such set; it is written $\bigcup x$. Thus $\bigcup x$ is
the set whose elements are exactly the elements of the elements of $x$, and
$a \cup b := \bigcup\{a,b\}$ is the **binary union** of $a$ and $b$, formed from
the unordered pair of [[def-unordered-pair-and-singleton]]:

$$z \in \bigcup x \leftrightarrow \exists s\,(s \in x \wedge z \in s).$$

The membership criterion for the binary union, that $z \in a \cup b$ holds
exactly when $z \in a$ or $z \in b$, is proved at
[[lem-unions-and-intersections-of-small-families]] rather than assumed here.

## Remarks

- **One layer only.** $\bigcup x$ collects the elements of the elements of $x$,
  not the elements of $x$. For a set of sets of sets the operation therefore has
  to be applied twice, and that iteration is what makes
  $\bigcup\bigcup R$ the right ambient set for the domain and range of a
  relation.

- **Notation.** $\bigcup$ with a single set argument is the primitive operation
  supplied by the axiom; $\cup$ between two sets is the derived binary one. The
  indexed form $\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i$ is a further abbreviation, defined once
  indexed families are available.

## Definition

Let $x$ and $y$ be sets. [[def-axiom-of-pairing]] gives a set whose elements are
exactly $x$ and $y$, and [[def-axiom-of-extensionality]] shows there is only one
such set; it is written $\{x,y\}$. Thus $\{x,y\}$ is the set whose elements are
exactly $x$ and $y$, and $\{x\} := \{x,x\}$, the **singleton** of $x$, is the set
whose only element is $x$:

$$t \in \{x,y\} \leftrightarrow (t = x \vee t = y), \qquad t \in \{x\} \leftrightarrow t = x .$$

## Remarks

- **The pair is unordered.** $t = x \vee t = y$ and $t = y \vee t = x$ are the
  same condition, so $\{x,y\} = \{y,x\}$, and the notation records no order.
  [[lem-unordered-pair-equality]] says exactly how much information a pair does
  carry, and [[def-ordered-pair]] is the construction that recovers an order from
  unordered pairs alone.

- **A singleton is not its element.** $\{x\}$ has exactly one element, namely
  $x$, and $x$ and $\{x\}$ are different sets whenever they have different
  elements; $\{\varnothing\}$ has one element while $\varnothing$ has none, so
  the two are already distinct at the bottom of the hierarchy.
