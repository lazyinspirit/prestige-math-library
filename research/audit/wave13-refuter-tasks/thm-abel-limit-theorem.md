## Statement

If the real series $\sum_{n\ge0}a_n$ converges ordinarily to $s$, then it is Abel summable to $s$:

$$\lim_{x\uparrow1}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_nx^n=s.$$

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Inclusive partial sums $S_n:=\sum_{k=0}^{n}a_k$ with $S_n\to s$.

[L1] Finite Abel summation gives $\sum_{k=0}^{N}a_kx^k=S_Nx^N+(1-x)\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}S_kx^k$ ([[lem-abel-summation-by-parts]]).

[L2] A convergent sequence is bounded ([[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]]).

[L3] $\sum_{n\ge0}x^n=1/(1-x)$ for $0\le x<1$ ([[thm-geometric-series]]).

[L4] A nonnegative series dominated termwise by a convergent nonnegative series converges ([[thm-direct-comparison-test]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L2], choose $M$ with $|S_n|\le M$ for every $n$. For fixed $0\le x<1$, one has $|S_nx^n|\le Mx^n$, so [L3] and [L4] give absolute convergence of $\sum_nS_nx^n$; the same bound gives $S_Nx^N\to0$. [L2, L3, L4, choose]

2.1 Apply [L1] and let $N\to\infty$. Step 1.1 gives convergence of the Abel series and $A(x)=(1-x)\sum_{n\ge0}S_nx^n$. Subtracting $s=(1-x)\sum_{n\ge0}sx^n$ gives $A(x)-s=(1-x)\sum_{n\ge0}(S_n-s)x^n$. [step 1.1, L1, L3]

3.1 Given $\varepsilon>0$, choose $N$ so that $|S_n-s|<\varepsilon$ for $n\ge N$. The tail of step 2.1 has absolute value at most $\varepsilon(1-x)\sum_{n\ge N}x^n\le\varepsilon$. [given, step 2.1, L3, choose]

4.1 The finite head $(1-x)\sum_{n<N}(S_n-s)x^n$ tends to $0$ as $x\uparrow1$. Thus $|A(x)-s|<2\varepsilon$ for all sufficiently large $x<1$, proving the asserted one-sided limit and Abel summability. [step 2.1, step 3.1] ∎

## Definition

For a real series $\sum_{n\ge0}a_n$, write its inclusive partial sums as

$$S_n:=\sum_{k=0}^{n}a_k$$

and their Cesaro means as

$$\sigma_n:=\frac1{\iota(n+1)}\sum_{k=0}^{n}S_k.$$

The series is **Cesaro summable to $s$** if $\sigma_n\to s$ ([[def-cesaro-mean]]).

It is **Abel summable to $s$** if the power series

$$A(x):=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_nx^n$$

converges for every $0\le x<1$ and $\lim_{x\uparrow1}A(x)=s$ in the one-sided sense of [[def-function-limit]]. These are summability methods for the zero-indexed series of [[def-series]]; they do not assert ordinary convergence.

## Statement

Let $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ be sequences of reals and let

$$A_n \;:=\; \sum_{k<n} a_k \qquad (n \in \mathbb{N})$$

be the partial sums of $\sum a_k$ ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]]), so that
$A_0 = 0$ and $a_k = A_{k+1} - A_k$ for every $k$. Then for every natural number
$n \ge 1$

$$\sum_{k<n} a_k b_k \;=\; A_n\, b_{n-1} \;-\; \sum_{k<n-1} A_{k+1}\,(b_{k+1} - b_k) .$$

Both sides are finite sums in the sense of [[def-finite-sum]]; at $n = 1$ the
right-hand sum is empty and the identity reads $a_0 b_0 = A_1 b_0$.

**The hypothesis $n \ge 1$ is what makes the statement legitimate**, not merely
convenient: the index $n-1$ occurs on the right, and $n-1$ is a natural number
exactly when $n \ge 1$. At $n = 0$ there is nothing to state, both the left-hand
side and $A_0$ being $0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ of reals and the partial sums $A_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ ([[def-series]]).

[L1] Finite sums are defined by the recursion $\sum_{k<0} x_k = 0$ and $\sum_{k<n+1} x_k = \sum_{k<n} x_k + x_n$ ([[def-finite-sum]]).

[L2] The partial sums satisfy $A_0 = 0$ and $A_{n+1} = A_n + a_n$ for every $n$, those being the two clauses of [L1] applied to $(a_k)$ ([[def-series]]).

[L3] Finite sums are additive and may be split at any intermediate index ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L4] The principle of induction on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 The claim to be proved by induction is the statement $P(m)$: the displayed identity holds at $n = m+1$, that is $\sum_{k<m+1} a_k b_k = A_{m+1} b_m - \sum_{k<m} A_{k+1}(b_{k+1} - b_k)$. Every $n \ge 1$ is $m+1$ for exactly one $m \in \mathbb{N}$, so proving $P(m)$ for all $m$ proves the lemma. [L4]

1.2 $P(0)$ holds: the left-hand side is $\sum_{k<1} a_k b_k = a_0 b_0$ by [L1], while $A_1 = A_0 + a_0 = a_0$ by [L2] and $\sum_{k<0} A_{k+1}(b_{k+1}-b_k) = 0$ by [L1], so the right-hand side is $a_0 b_0 - 0$. [L1, L2, base]

1.3 Assume $P(m)$ for a fixed $m \in \mathbb{N}$. [ih]

1.4 By [L1], $\sum_{k<m+2} a_k b_k = \sum_{k<m+1} a_k b_k + a_{m+1} b_{m+1}$. [L1]

1.5 By [L1], $\sum_{k<m+1} A_{k+1}(b_{k+1} - b_k) = \sum_{k<m} A_{k+1}(b_{k+1} - b_k) + A_{m+1}(b_{m+1} - b_m)$. [L1, L3]

1.6 By [L2], $A_{m+2} = A_{m+1} + a_{m+1}$, so $a_{m+1} = A_{m+2} - A_{m+1}$. [L2]

2.1 Substituting the induction hypothesis into step 1.4 gives $\sum_{k<m+2} a_k b_k = A_{m+1} b_m - \sum_{k<m} A_{k+1}(b_{k+1}-b_k) + a_{m+1} b_{m+1}$. [step 1.3, step 1.4]

2.2 Using step 1.6, $A_{m+1} b_m + a_{m+1} b_{m+1} = A_{m+1} b_m + A_{m+2} b_{m+1} - A_{m+1} b_{m+1} = A_{m+2} b_{m+1} - A_{m+1}(b_{m+1} - b_m)$. [step 1.6, algebra]

3.1 Combining step 2.1 and step 2.2 and then step 1.5 gives $\sum_{k<m+2} a_k b_k = A_{m+2} b_{m+1} - A_{m+1}(b_{m+1}-b_m) - \sum_{k<m} A_{k+1}(b_{k+1}-b_k) = A_{m+2} b_{m+1} - \sum_{k<m+1} A_{k+1}(b_{k+1}-b_k)$, which is $P(m+1)$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 1.5, algebra]

4.1 By [L4] applied to step 1.2 and step 3.1, $P(m)$ holds for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$, that is, the displayed identity holds for every $n \ge 1$. [step 1.2, step 3.1, L4, discharge-induction] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the identity is for.** It converts a series $\sum a_k b_k$, about which nothing is assumed, into a boundary term $A_n b_{n-1}$ and a series $\sum A_{k+1}(b_{k+1} - b_k)$ whose terms carry the *differences* of $(b_k)$. If $(A_n)$ is bounded and $(b_k)$ is monotone, those differences have one sign and telescope, which is exactly the situation of [[thm-dirichlet-test]]. The transformation is the discrete analogue of integration by parts, and the boundary term is the analogue of the boundary term there.

- **The block form needs no separate proof.** For $1 \le M \le n$, subtracting the identity at $M$ from the identity at $n$ gives $\sum_{k=M}^{n-1} a_k b_k = A_n b_{n-1} - A_M b_{M-1} - \sum_{k=M-1}^{n-2} A_{k+1}(b_{k+1}-b_k)$, using only splitting of finite sums ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]). Nothing on this page needs that form, so it is recorded here rather than stated as a result.

- **Two conventions are doing work.** $A_n$ sums the $n$ terms $a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$, so $A_0 = 0$ and $a_k = A_{k+1} - A_k$ with no shift ([[def-series]]); and the empty sum is $0$ ([[def-finite-sum]]), which is what makes $n = 1$ a genuine instance of the identity rather than a case to be excluded.

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals converging to $x \in \mathbb{R}$
([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]). Then $(x_k)$ is bounded: there is
$M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals converging to a real $x$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L1] Convergence: for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$ ([[def-real-limit]]); and $1$ is a rational $> 0$, since $\mathbb{Q}$ is an ordered field ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and $0 < 1$ in every ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] Triangle inequality: $|a + b| \le |a| + |b|$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Absolute value: $|u| \ge 0$ for every real $u$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L4] Finite maxima: for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and all reals $a_0, \dots, a_n$ the set $\{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$ has a maximum ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]); a maximum lies in the set and dominates every element of it ([[def-max-min]]).

[L5] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: transitivity of $\le$ and of $<$; both mixed forms, $u < v \le w \Rightarrow u < w$ and $u \le v < w \Rightarrow u < w$, and the implication $u < v \Rightarrow u \le v$, all immediate from the reading of $u \le v$ as "$u < v$ or $u = v$" ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]); and translation invariance, $a < b \Rightarrow a + c < b + c$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

[L6] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total, so every index $k$ satisfies $k < K$ or $k \ge K$ ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Apply convergence with the rational $\varepsilon = 1$: fix $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $|x_k - x| < 1$ for all $k \ge K$. [L1]

2.1 For every $k \ge K$ we have $|x_k| = |(x_k - x) + x| \le |x_k - x| + |x|$, while adding $|x|$ to both sides of $|x_k - x| < 1$ gives $|x_k - x| + |x| < 1 + |x| = |x| + 1$; composing the non-strict inequality with the strict one yields $|x_k| < |x| + 1$. [step 1.1, L2, L5]

2.2 Define $M := \max\{\, |x_0|, |x_1|, \dots, |x_{K-1}|, |x| + 1 \,\}$, the maximum of the finite list obtained by appending $|x| + 1$ to the first $K$ values $|x_0|, \dots, |x_{K-1}|$; the list is nonempty because its last entry is always present (when $K = 0$ the list is the single entry $|x| + 1$), so the maximum exists by [L4]. [step 1.1, L4, choose]

3.1 For every $k < K$ the value $|x_k|$ is one of the entries of that list, hence $|x_k| \le M$. [step 2.2, L4]

3.2 For every $k \ge K$ we have $|x_k| < |x| + 1 \le M$, since $|x| + 1$ is an entry of the list, hence $|x_k| \le M$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L4, L5]

4.1 Every index satisfies $k < K$ or $k \ge K$, and in both cases $|x_k| \le M$; therefore $(x_k)$ is bounded. [step 3.1, step 3.2, L3, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- This is where [[lem-finite-set-has-max]] does its main work on this page: the first $K$ terms are bounded because a nonempty finite set of reals has a maximum, and that fact is proved once, by induction, rather than re-derived here. It is not the only consumer, and no claim of uniqueness is made: [[lem-null-times-bounded]] and [[rem-sequence-conventions]] cite the same lemma, each for a maximum of finitely many reals.

- The converse is false. A bounded sequence need not converge ([[fs-bounded-implies-convergent]]). What is true in that direction is the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, which requires a passage to a subsequence; it is **not available at this point in the reading order**, being the subject of the next page of this track, *Monotone Sequences, Bolzano-Weierstrass, and Cauchy Completeness*, where it is proved.

- Boundedness is exactly what makes [[lem-null-times-bounded]] applicable to a convergent factor, and that is how boundedness enters the product rule of [[thm-algebra-of-limits]].

## Statement

Let $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ be sequences of reals and suppose there is
$K \in \mathbb{N}$ with

$$0 \;\le\; a_k \;\le\; b_k \qquad \text{for all } k \ge K .$$

Then:

1. if $\sum b_k$ converges then $\sum a_k$ converges ([[def-series]]);
2. if $\sum a_k$ diverges then $\sum b_k$ diverges.

The same statement holds verbatim for series with a general starting index $m$,
applied to the shifted sequences of [[def-series]].

The hypothesis is on the terms from some index on, not on all of them: finitely
many terms of either sequence may violate it, or be negative, without affecting
the conclusion. What may not be dropped is nonnegativity of $(a_k)$ from that
index on.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $(a_k)$, $(b_k)$ of reals and $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $0 \le a_k \le b_k$ for all $k \ge K$; the partial sums $\alpha_j = \sum_{i<j} a_{K+i}$ and $\beta_j = \sum_{i<j} b_{K+i}$ of the $K$-th tail series ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[L1] Monotonicity of finite sums: if $x_i \le y_i$ for all $i < j$ then $\sum_{i<j} x_i \le \sum_{i<j} y_i$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L2] A series converges if and only if its $K$-th tail series converges ([[lem-series-tail-invariance]]).

[L3] For a series of nonnegative terms: it converges if and only if the range of its partial sums is bounded above, and in the convergent case every partial sum is at most the sum ([[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For every $i \in \mathbb{N}$ the index $K + i$ is at least $K$, so $0 \le a_{K+i} \le b_{K+i}$; in particular both tail series have nonnegative terms. [given]

1.2 Assume $\sum b_k$ converges. Then its $K$-th tail series $\sum_{k \ge K} b_k$ converges. [given, L2]

2.1 By monotonicity of finite sums, $\alpha_j \le \beta_j$ for every $j \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 1.1, L1]

2.2 That tail series has nonnegative terms, so its partial sums satisfy $\beta_j \le B$ for every $j$, where $B$ is its sum. [step 1.2, step 1.1, L3]

3.1 Hence $\alpha_j \le \beta_j \le B$ for every $j$, so the range of $(\alpha_j)$ is bounded above by $B$. [step 2.1, step 2.2]

4.1 The tail series $\sum_{k \ge K} a_k$ has nonnegative terms and partial sums bounded above, so it converges. [step 3.1, step 1.1, L3]

5.1 Therefore $\sum a_k$ converges, which is claim 1. [step 4.1, L2]

6.1 Claim 2 is the contrapositive of claim 1: if $\sum a_k$ diverges then $\sum b_k$ cannot converge. [step 5.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Both nonnegativity hypotheses are used, and in different places.** $a_k \ge 0$ is what lets convergence of $\sum_{k \ge K} a_k$ be read off from boundedness of its partial sums, and $b_k \ge a_k \ge 0$ is what makes the sum of $\sum_{k \ge K} b_k$ an upper bound for the partial sums $\beta_j$. Drop the sign hypothesis and the theorem is false, not merely unproved; the companion page exhibits a pair with $a_k \le b_k$ for every $k$, $\sum b_k$ convergent and $\sum a_k$ divergent.

- **The comparison is with a series, not with a limit.** No quotient $a_k/b_k$ appears and no $b_k$ is required to be nonzero, which is what distinguishes this test from the limit comparison test proved next.

## Statement

Let $r \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $r^k$ be the integer power ([[def-integer-power]]),
so that $r^0 = 1$ for every $r$, including $r = 0$.

1. If $|r| < 1$ then the series $\sum r^k$ converges ([[def-series]]) and
   $$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} r^{k} \;=\; \frac{1}{1-r} .$$
2. If $|r| \ge 1$ then $\sum r^k$ diverges.

The series starts at $k = 0$ and its first term is $r^0 = 1$; in particular
$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} 2^{-k} = 2$, while the series starting at $k = 1$ sums to
$1$. Which starting index is meant has to be said, and it is said here.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real number $r$, the integer powers $r^k$ ([[def-integer-power]]), and the partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} r^k$ of $\sum r^k$ ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[L1] Factorisation of a difference of powers: for $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and natural $n \ge 1$, $b^n - a^n = (b-a)\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a^k b^{\,n-1-k}$ ([[lem-power-difference-factorisation]]).

[L2] For $|r| < 1$ the sequence $(r^k)$ is null, that is $r^k \to 0$ ([[lem-geometric-sequence-null]]).

[L3] Algebra of limits: sums, differences and quotients of convergent sequences converge to the corresponding combination, the quotient rule requiring a nonzero limit and nonzero denominators ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L4] Absolute value: $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$, $|x| \ge 0$, and $|x| = 0$ exactly when $x = 0$; also $|1| = 1$, since $1 > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L5] Powers and order: $a^0 = 1$ for every $a$; if $a \ge 1$ and $n \ge 1$ then $a^n \ge a \ge 1$; and $1^n = 1$ for every $n$ ([[lem-power-monotone]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L6] The principle of induction ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L7] If a series converges then its terms tend to $0$ ([[lem-nth-term-test]]).

[L8] Notation of [[def-finite-sum]]: $\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x_k$ is $\sum_{k<n} x_k$, and the empty sum $\sum_{k<0} x_k$ is $0$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Assume $|r| < 1$. [assume-case lt]

1.2 Assume instead $|r| \ge 1$. [assume-case ge]

1.3 For every natural $n \ge 1$, applying [L1] with $b = 1$ and $a = r$ gives $1 - r^n = (1-r)\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} r^k \cdot 1^{\,n-1-k} = (1-r)\,s_n$, using $1^m = 1$ and the notation of [L8]. [L1, L5, L8]

1.4 At $n = 0$ the identity $1 - r^n = (1-r)s_n$ also holds, both sides being $0$ because $r^0 = 1$ and $s_0$ is the empty sum. [L5, L8]

2.1 In the case $|r| < 1$ we have $r \ne 1$, since $|1| = 1$ and $|r| < 1$; hence $1 - r \ne 0$. [step 1.1, L4, algebra]

2.2 In the case $|r| \ge 1$, an induction gives $|r^k| = |r|^k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$: at $k = 0$ both sides are $1$, and if $|r^k| = |r|^k$ then $|r^{k+1}| = |r^k \cdot r| = |r^k|\,|r| = |r|^k |r| = |r|^{k+1}$. [step 1.2, L4, L5, L6]

2.3 In the case $|r| \ge 1$ we get $|r|^k \ge 1$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$: at $k = 0$ this reads $1 \ge 1$, and for $k \ge 1$ it is the comparison $|r|^k \ge |r| \ge 1$. [step 1.2, L5]

3.1 In the case $|r| < 1$, dividing by $1 - r \ne 0$ gives $s_n = (1 - r^n)/(1-r)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.1, step 1.3, step 1.4, algebra]

3.2 In the case $|r| \ge 1$, combining the two previous steps gives $|r^k - 0| = |r^k| = |r|^k \ge 1$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.2, step 2.3]

4.1 In the case $|r| < 1$ the sequence $(r^n)$ is null, so $1 - r^n \to 1$ and therefore $s_n \to 1/(1-r)$, the denominator being the nonzero constant $1-r$; hence $\sum r^k$ converges with sum $1/(1-r)$, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 3.1, step 2.1, L2, L3]

4.2 In the case $|r| \ge 1$ the sequence $(r^k)$ does not converge to $0$, since the rational tolerance $\varepsilon = 1$ admits no index $K$ with $|r^k - 0| < 1$ for all $k \ge K$; so by the term test $\sum r^k$ diverges, which is claim 2. [step 3.2, L7]

5.1 The two cases $|r| < 1$ and $|r| \ge 1$ exhaust the possibilities, since the order on $\mathbb{R}$ is total, so claims 1 and 2 together cover every real $r$. [step 4.1, step 4.2, cases-exhaustive] ∎

## Remarks

- **The divergence half needs no separate treatment of $r = 1$ and $r = -1$.** Both are covered by $|r| \ge 1$, and the single reason is the same in every case: the terms have absolute value at least $1$, so they cannot tend to $0$. For $r = 1$ the partial sums are $s_n = n$ and run to $+\infty$; for $r = -1$ they oscillate between $0$ and $1$. The theorem says only that neither converges, which is all that "diverges" means here ([[def-series]]).

- **Why the identity is proved at $n = 0$ separately.** [[lem-power-difference-factorisation]] requires $n \ge 1$, since its right-hand side is a sum over $k < n$ of a term involving $b^{\,n-1-k}$, and $n-1$ is not a natural number at $n = 0$. The identity is still true at $n = 0$, but by inspection of two empty objects rather than by that lemma, and step 1.4 says so rather than letting the reader assume the citation covers it.
