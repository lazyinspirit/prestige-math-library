## Statement

Every subset of a null subset of $\mathbb R^m$ is null. Assuming countable choice, every countable union of null subsets of $\mathbb R^m$ is null.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Null sets $E_j$, $j\in\mathbb N$.

[L1] Nullity is the cube-cover condition of [[def-null-and-content-zero-in-rn]].

[L2] Countable choice selects one cover for each $E_j$ ([[def-countable-choice]]), and $\mathbb N^2$ is countable ([[thm-n-cross-n-countable]]).

[L3] $\sum_{j\ge0}2^{-j-1}=1$ ([[thm-geometric-series]]).

[L4] A nonnegative series converges with sum at most $M$ whenever all of its finite partial sums are at most $M$ ([[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]], [[def-series]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 Subset closure follows because any cover of a set covers every subset.  [L1]

1.2 Given $\varepsilon>0$, choose for each $j$ a cube cover of $E_j$ with total volume at most $\varepsilon2^{-j-1}$. This simultaneous selection uses [L2].  [L1, L2, L3, construct]

2.1 Enumerate the doubly indexed cubes through a bijection $\mathbb N\to\mathbb N^2$. Every finite partial sum is contained in a finite rectangle of indices and is at most $\sum_j\varepsilon2^{-j-1}\le\varepsilon$.   [step 1.2, L2, L3, given]

3.1 By [L4], the enumerated nonnegative volume series converges with sum at most $\varepsilon$. The cubes cover $\bigcup_jE_j$, proving nullity.  [step 2.1, L1, L4, discharge-construct] ∎

## Definition

The **Axiom of Countable Choice**, written $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$, is the following
statement.

> For every family $(X_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of nonempty sets indexed by
> $\mathbb{N}$ there is a function $f$ with domain $\mathbb{N}$ such that
> $f(n) \in X_n$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

Equivalently, in the vocabulary of [[def-choice-function]]: every at most
countable family of nonempty sets ([[def-countable]]) has a choice function.

## Remarks

- **The two formulations are equivalent, and the passage between them uses no
  choice.** Given an at most countable family $\mathcal{F}$ of nonempty sets,
  either $\mathcal{F} = \varnothing$, where the empty function is a choice
  function, or a surjection $s : \mathbb{N} \to \mathcal{F}$ exists
  ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]]); applying the indexed form to
  $X_n := s(n)$ gives $f$ with $f(n) \in s(n)$, and
  $g(S) := f(\min\{\, n : s(n) = S \,\})$ is a choice function for $\mathcal{F}$,
  the minimum being canonical by [[thm-well-ordering-principle]]. Conversely a
  choice function $g$ on the at most countable family $\{\, X_n : n \in \mathbb{N} \,\}$
  gives $f(n) := g(X_n)$.

- **$\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ is strictly weaker than the Axiom of Choice**
  ([[def-axiom-of-choice]]): AC implies it immediately, since AC applies to every
  family, while it is consistent with ZF that $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ holds and AC
  fails. **It is also strictly stronger than what ZF proves**: it is consistent
  with ZF that $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ fails, as Cohen's first model shows, since an
  infinite set of reals with no countably infinite subset
  ([[rem-cohen-first-model]]) is already a failure of $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$; the
  Feferman-Levy model ([[rem-feferman-levy-model]]) is a second witness. Both
  statements are conditional on the consistency of ZF and are external results,
  established by forcing and by permutation models; they are recorded here with
  references and are **not** proved in this library, which contains neither
  technique. Of the two, only the failure of $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ is recorded in
  this library's catalogue of unproved results; the separation of
  $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ from AC in the other direction is quoted from the
  references alone.

- **Dependent choice sits between them.** The Axiom of Dependent Choice
  (DC) says that if $R$ is a relation on a nonempty set $X$ such that every
  $x \in X$ has some $y$ with $x \mathbin{R} y$, then there is a sequence
  $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ with $x_n \mathbin{R} x_{n+1}$ for all $n$. In ZF,
  $\mathrm{AC} \Rightarrow \mathrm{DC} \Rightarrow \mathrm{AC}_\omega$; both
  implications are theorems of ZF, and neither is proved here. That neither
  reverses is a pair of relative-consistency results of the same kind as in the
  previous bullet: if ZF is consistent, then so are ZF + DC + (not AC) and
  ZF + $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ + (not DC). Both are established by forcing and by
  permutation models, are quoted here from the references rather than proved, and
  cannot be stated without the consistency hypothesis; so "DC is *strictly*
  between AC and $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$" is shorthand for those two conditional
  statements and is never used here as a standalone assertion. DC is the
  principle that legitimises "choose $x_0$, then choose $x_1$ depending on
  $x_0$, and so on"; $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ only legitimises countably many
  *independent* choices made at once.

- **Being an axiom, $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ carries no well-definedness obligation**,
  which is why this item has no `justified_by`. Its role in this library is
  bookkeeping: [[thm-countable-union-of-countable]] assumes it and flags the exact
  step that spends it, and [[fs-countable-union-theorem-of-zf]] records that the
  assumption cannot be removed.

- Every result *proved* on this page other than
  [[thm-countable-union-of-countable]] is a theorem of ZF alone. In particular
  [[lem-subset-of-countable]], [[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]],
  [[thm-schroder-bernstein]], [[thm-rationals-countable]], [[thm-cantor-powerset]]
  and [[thm-r-uncountable]] are choice free, and each says so. The false
  statements at the end of the page are not all of that kind, and the claim above
  does not cover them: two of the three refute a ZF-provability claim only under
  the hypothesis that ZF is consistent, quoting an external independence result
  rather than proving it, and they say so in their own Facts.

## Definition

Throughout this page $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), in particular an ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]]) and a field ([[def-field]]), and $\mathbb{N}$ is the set
of natural numbers ([[def-natural-numbers]]) with successor $\sigma(n) = n + 1$
([[def-nat-addition]]).

Let $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a sequence of reals, written $a_k$ for
$a(k)$. **Finite sums and finite products of $a$ are defined by recursion on the
upper index**, which is legitimate because of the recursion theorem
([[thm-recursion]]). That theorem produces a function of one variable, so the
running index has to be carried along inside the value: applying it to the set
$A = \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$, the starting element $(0, 0)$ and the function
$f(n, s) = (\sigma(n),\, s + a_n)$ gives a unique
$g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$ with

$$g(0) = (0, 0), \qquad g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n)) \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Write $g(n) = \big(\pi_1(g(n)),\, \Sigma_n\big)$ for its two coordinates.

**The first coordinate is the index itself, and that is a small induction, not an
observation** ([[thm-induction-principle]]). Indeed $\pi_1(g(0)) = 0$; and if
$\pi_1(g(n)) = n$, then
$g(\sigma(n)) = f\big(\pi_1(g(n)), \Sigma_n\big) = \big(\sigma(\pi_1(g(n))),\, \Sigma_n + a_{\pi_1(g(n))}\big) = \big(\sigma(n),\, \Sigma_n + a_n\big)$,
so $\pi_1(g(\sigma(n))) = \sigma(n)$. By induction $\pi_1(g(n)) = n$ for every
$n \in \mathbb{N}$. Only now may the second coordinate of the two displayed
clauses be read off, and doing so gives

$$\Sigma_0 = 0, \qquad \Sigma_{\sigma(n)} = \Sigma_n + a_n .$$

$\Sigma$ is moreover the **unique** function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with those
two properties: if $\Sigma'$ also has them then $n \mapsto (n, \Sigma'_n)$ satisfies
the two clauses defining $g$, hence equals $g$ by the uniqueness clause of
[[thm-recursion]], so $\Sigma' = \Sigma$.

We write $\sum_{k < n} a_k := \Sigma_n$. The same construction with starting
element $(0, 1)$ and $f(n, p) = (\sigma(n),\, p \cdot a_n)$, with the same
induction on the first coordinate and the same uniqueness argument, gives the
unique $\Pi : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with

$$\Pi_0 = 1, \qquad \Pi_{\sigma(n)} = \Pi_n \cdot a_n ,$$

and we write $\prod_{k < n} a_k := \Pi_n$.

**Notation.** For $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ we abbreviate

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \sum_{k < n+1} a_k, \qquad \prod_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \prod_{k < n+1} a_k,$$

and, for a general lower index $m$ with $m \le n + 1$, writing $d = n + 1 - m$
for the number of terms,

$$\sum_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \sum_{j < d} a_{m+j}, \qquad \prod_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \prod_{j < d} a_{m+j} .$$

When $m = n + 1$ we have $d = 0$ and the sum is **empty**, with value $0$, while
the empty product has value $1$. In the same spirit $\sum_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ is
notation for the empty sum $\Sigma_0 = 0$ and $\prod_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ for the
empty product $\Pi_0 = 1$; the index $-1$ never occurs as an element of
$\mathbb{N}$ and is only a way of writing "no terms".

Only finitely many values of $a$ enter $\sum_{k<n} a_k$, so the notation
$\sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\prod_{k<n} a_k$ is also used for a list
$a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$ of reals given without reference to any extension of the
list to all of $\mathbb{N}$: extend the list by $a_k = 0$ (respectively
$a_k = 1$) for $k \ge n$ and apply the definition above.

## Remarks

- **Why recursion and not "$a_0 + a_1 + \cdots + a_{n-1}$".** The dots are not a
  definition: they presuppose that the displayed pattern determines a value for
  every $n$, which is exactly what the recursion theorem
  ([[thm-recursion]]) supplies, and its uniqueness clause is what makes
  $\sum_{k<n} a_k$ a single well-determined real rather than a family of choices.
  Associativity and commutativity of addition are *not* used in the definition;
  they are used in the laws proved from it ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).
- **Naturals and rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$ (a convention used on the whole
  page).** A natural number $n$ and a rational number $r$ are not literally
  elements of $\mathbb{R}$: they enter $\mathbb{R}$ through the canonical
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$, which is an injective,
  order-preserving field homomorphism ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), restricting on
  positive naturals to $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} = 1_\mathbb{R} + \cdots + 1_\mathbb{R}$
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). Following ordinary practice, and only where no
  confusion is possible, we write $n$ for $\iota(n)$ and $r$ for $\iota(r)$; so,
  for instance, $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k<n} a_k$ means
  $\iota(n)^{-1} \cdot \sum_{k<n} a_k$, which makes sense because
  $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$. Exponents are the one place where the
  identification is deliberately NOT made: in $a^n$ and $a^r$ the exponent stays
  a natural, an integer or a rational ([[def-integer-power]],
  [[def-rational-power]]), never a real.
- The two indexings are related by $\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k = \sum_{k < n+1} a_k$, so
  a statement proved for one is available for the other. Sums over $k < n$ are
  the primitive form here because $\Sigma_0$, the empty sum, is then the base
  case of every induction, and no index outside $\mathbb{N}$ is ever needed.

## Definition

Let $a \in \mathbb{R}$, where $\mathbb{R}$ is the ambient ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]).

**Natural exponents.** By the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) applied to
the set $\mathbb{R}$, the starting element $1$ and the function
$f(x) = x \cdot a$, there is a unique function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$,
written $n \mapsto a^n$, with

$$a^0 = 1, \qquad a^{n+1} = a^n \cdot a \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Thus $a^1 = a$, $a^2 = a \cdot a$, and so on. Note that this is defined for
**every** $a$, including $a = 0$.

**Negative exponents.** If $a \ne 0$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, set

$$a^{-n} := (a^n)^{-1}.$$

**Why that is legitimate.** The right-hand side presupposes that $a^n$ is
invertible, that is, that $a^n \ne 0$. This is a proof obligation and not an
observation, and it is discharged by claim 2 of [[lem-power-laws]]: for $a \ne 0$
in a field, $a^n \ne 0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, proved there by induction on
$n$ from the fact that a field has no zero divisors ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]).
That lemma is a statement *about* the operation introduced here, so it depends on
this definition and is recorded in this item's `justified_by` rather than in its
`deps` (SCHEMA §3). Given $a^n \ne 0$, the value $(a^n)^{-1}$ is a single
well-determined element, because multiplicative inverses in a field are unique
([[lem-of-inverse-unique]]).

**Integer exponents.** Every integer $m$ ([[def-integers]]) is either
$\iota(n)$ or $-\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$, where $\iota$ is the
embedding $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]],
[[def-int-operations]]). This too is a citation and not a slogan: the order on
$\mathbb{Z}$ is total ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), so $m \ge 0$ or $m < 0$; the
image of $\iota$ is exactly the set of nonnegative integers, and each of them is
$\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]); and if $m < 0$ then
$-m > 0$, by compatibility of the order with addition ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]),
so $-m = \iota(n)$ and $m = -\iota(n)$, with $n$ unique because $\iota$ is
injective. The two clauses above therefore define $a^m$ for every
$m \in \mathbb{Z}$ whenever $a \ne 0$, and for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$ for
arbitrary $a$. The clauses are consistent where they overlap: the only overlap is
$m = 0$, where $-\iota(0) = \iota(0)$ and $(a^0)^{-1} = 1^{-1} = 1 = a^0$.

## Remarks

- **The convention $0^0 = 1$ is adopted here**, and it is not a matter of taste
  but of agreement with the recursion above: $a^0 = 1$ is the starting value for
  every $a$, exactly as the empty product is $1$ ([[def-finite-sum]]). This is
  the convention that makes the empty product, the binomial theorem, and
  polynomial notation $\sum_k c_k x^k$ work at $x = 0$ without an exception. The
  competing convention "$0^0$ undefined" belongs to contexts where $x^y$ is
  studied as a function of two *real* variables and one wants continuity, which
  is unavailable and irrelevant here: the exponent in $a^m$ is an integer, never
  a real.
- $0^n = 0$ for every $n \ge 1$, since $0^{n} = 0^{n-1} \cdot 0 = 0$, a product
  with a zero factor ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]); and
  $0^{-n}$ is not defined for $n \ge 1$, since $0$ has no inverse.
- The exponent is an integer and stays an integer. Rational exponents are a
  separate construction resting on the existence of roots
  ([[thm-nth-roots-exist]], [[def-rational-power]]), and real exponents do not
  exist in this library yet ([[rem-real-exponents-deferred]]).
- The laws $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$ are
  proved, not assumed, in [[lem-power-laws]]; the order behaviour of $a \mapsto a^n$
  is [[lem-power-monotone]].

## Definition

Fix $m\ge1$. A **closed cube** is a rectangle $\prod_{j<m}[a_j,a_j+\ell]$ with $\ell\ge0$; its volume is $\ell^m$. A set $E\subseteq\mathbb R^m$ is **null** when, for every $\varepsilon>0$, it is covered by a sequence of closed cubes whose nonnegative volume series converges with sum at most $\varepsilon$. It has **content zero** when such a cover can be finite.

The series and finite sums are [[def-series]] and [[def-finite-sum]], and their nonnegative bounds use [[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]] and [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]. Both properties pass to subsets. Padding a finite cover with degenerate zero-volume cubes proves that content zero implies null. This terminology defines only cover-nullity; it does not define a measure on arbitrary sets.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-real-numbers]]) and
a **sequence of reals** is a function $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$
([[def-sequence]]), written $(a_k)$; recall that $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$.

**Partial sums.** Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals. Its **sequence of partial
sums** is

$$s_n \;:=\; \sum_{k < n} a_k \qquad (n \in \mathbb{N}),$$

the finite sum of [[def-finite-sum]]. In particular $s_0 = 0$, the empty sum, and
$s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ for every $n$, those being exactly the two recursion clauses
that define the finite sum. Note that $s_n$ is the sum of the $n$ terms
$a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$, so the index $n$ counts terms rather than naming the last
one.

**Convergence, the sum, divergence.** The **series** of $(a_k)$, written
$\sum a_k$, **converges** when the sequence $(s_n)$ of partial sums converges
([[def-real-limit]]), and then the **sum of the series** is

$$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k \;:=\; \lim_{n} s_n .$$

The series **diverges** when $(s_n)$ does not converge. A convergent sequence of
reals has exactly one limit ([[lem-limit-unique]]), so the displayed symbol names
a single real number and nothing further has to be checked for it to be
well defined.

**Series with a general starting index.** Let $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $a$ be a
function on $\{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : k \ge m \,\}$, which we call a **family from
$m$** and write $(a_k)_{k \ge m}$. The series

$$\sum_{k \ge m} a_k$$

is by definition the series of the sequence $b_j := a_{j + m}$,
$j \in \mathbb{N}$, which is a genuine sequence of reals; it converges exactly
when that series converges, and its sum is then written
$\sum_{k = m}^{\infty} a_k$. Its partial sums are

$$\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k \;=\; \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j} \qquad (n \ge m),$$

in the notation of [[def-finite-sum]], the value at $n = m$ being the empty sum
$0$. A sequence on $\mathbb{N}$ is the case $m = 0$, and the two readings of
$\sum a_k$ agree there, since $b_j = a_j$.

**This clause is not a convenience.** Sequences in this library are functions on
$\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$ ([[def-sequence]]), while many of the
classical series are built from expressions that are undefined at the index $0$:
$1/k$, $1/k^{p}$ and $|a_k|^{1/k}$ all require $k \ge 1$. Writing such a series as
$\sum_{k \ge 1} a_k$ names an honest object, whereas writing it as a sequence on
$\mathbb{N}$ would require a value at an index where the defining expression has
none. Every statement on this page says which starting index it uses.

**Tail series.** For $N \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$N$-th tail series** of
$\sum a_k$ is $\sum_{k \ge N} a_k$, that is the series of the $N$-th tail
$a^{(N)}$ of [[def-sequence]], whose terms are $a^{(N)}_j = a_{j+N}$. The
$0$-th tail series is the series itself.

## Remarks

- **"Diverges" here means "does not converge", and nothing more.** A divergent
  series may have partial sums that run away to $+\infty$, or to $-\infty$, or
  that oscillate without settling anywhere. The three behaviours are not
  distinguished by the word, and no statement on this page uses "diverges" to
  mean "the partial sums are unbounded" unless it says so.

- **The symbol $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k$ is defined only for a convergent
  series.** It denotes a real number, not a formal object, and it is illegitimate
  to write it down before convergence has been established. Where a proof needs
  to speak of the series without knowing whether it converges, it speaks of
  $(a_k)$ and of $(s_n)$.

- **Two indices, doing different work.** The index $k$ runs over the terms and is
  bound; the index $n$ runs over the partial sums and is the variable in which the
  limit is taken. Confusing them is the commonest slip in the subject, and it is
  the reason the definition above fixes $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ rather than
  $\sum_{k \le n} a_k$: with this choice the recursion $s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ is
  the one supplied by [[def-finite-sum]], with no shift anywhere.

## Statement

Let $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be sequences of reals, let
$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, and let $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, with finite sums and
finite products as in [[def-finite-sum]]. Then:

1. **Additivity.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k$.
2. **Scaling.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k$; in particular $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda = n\lambda$, where $n$ denotes the canonical natural $\iota(n) \in \mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).
3. **Splitting.** If $m \le n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k$, and $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n} a_k = \Big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k\Big)$.
4. **Monotonicity.** If $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$. In particular, if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, every single term satisfies $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$ for $j < n$, and $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ forces $a_k = 0$ for every $k < n$.
5. **Telescoping.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}\big(c_{k+1} - c_k\big) = c_n - c_0$.
6. **Products.** $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k) = \Big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\Big)$; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, and if $a_k > 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k > 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\lambda$, and naturals $m, n$. Write $\Sigma_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\Pi_n = \prod_{k<n} a_k$.

[L1] Recursion clauses ([[def-finite-sum]]): $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ and $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n$; $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1$ and $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) \cdot a_n$; and $\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k = \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j}$ for $m \le n$, likewise for products.

[L2] Field axioms: addition and multiplication are associative and commutative, $0$ and $1$ are the identities, $x - x = 0$, and multiplication distributes over addition ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]); and $0 \cdot x = 0$, which is not an axiom but a lemma ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

[L3] Induction principle: a property holding at $0$ and inherited by successors holds at every natural ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L4] Adding inequalities: $x \le y$ and $u \le v$ imply $x + u \le y + v$. [[lem-of-add-order]] states the STRICT forms and only those ($x < y \Rightarrow x + c < y + c$, and $x < y$ with $u < v$ giving $x + u < y + v$); the nonstrict form used throughout below is those two together with the cases $x = y$ and $u = v$, which are settled by trichotomy, the order being total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] The canonical embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a field homomorphism, so $\iota(0) = 0$ and $\iota(n+1) = \iota(n) + 1$, and $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L6] Sign rules: a product of two positives is positive ([[lem-of-sign-rules]], claim 1), and a product of two nonnegatives is nonnegative, since a factor equal to $0$ makes the product $0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]) and otherwise both factors are positive; and $1 > 0$, which is proved in [[cor-of-one-positive]] and stated by none of the items named above.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 0$: every claim holds at $n = 0$, since both sides of claim 1 are $0 = 0 + 0$, both sides of claim 2 are $0 = \lambda \cdot 0$ and $0 = \iota(0)\lambda$, claim 4 reads $0 \le 0$ with no term to bound and the hypothesis $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ giving nothing to prove, claim 5 reads $0 = c_0 - c_0$, and claim 6 reads $1 = 1 \cdot 1$ with $1 > 0$. [base, L1, L2, L5, L6]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for this $n$ and for all sequences $a, b, c$ and all $\lambda$. [ih]

1.3 Splitting, claim 3, by a separate induction on the number of trailing terms $d = n - m$ with $m$ fixed: for $d = 0$ the claim reads $\sum_{k<m} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + 0$ and $\prod_{k<m} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\big) \cdot 1$, which hold; and if $\sum_{k<m+d} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d} a_{m+j}$, then $\sum_{k<m+d+1} a_k = \sum_{k<m+d} a_k + a_{m+d} = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \big(\sum_{j<d} a_{m+j} + a_{m+d}\big) = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d+1} a_{m+j}$ by associativity, and identically for products with $1$ in place of $0$ and multiplication in place of addition, so induction on $d$ gives claim 3 for every $m \le n$. [L1, L2, L3]

2.1 Additivity at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k\big) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) + \big(\sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n\big) = \sum_{k<n+1} a_k + \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$, using the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of addition. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Scaling at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda a_k = \sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda\big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) = \lambda \sum_{k<n+1} a_k$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and distributivity; taking $a_k = 1$ for all $k$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda = \sum_{k<n} \lambda + \lambda = \iota(n)\lambda + \lambda = (\iota(n) + 1)\lambda = \iota(n+1)\lambda$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L5]

2.3 Monotonicity at $n+1$: assume $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n+1$; then $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$, so the hypothesis gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$, and adding the inequality $a_n \le b_n$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n \le \sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n = \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$. [step 1.2, L1, L4]

2.4 Telescoping at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(c_{k+1} - c_k) = \sum_{k<n}(c_{k+1} - c_k) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = (c_n - c_0) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = c_{n+1} - c_0$, by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and the field identities. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.5 Products at $n+1$: $\prod_{k<n+1}(a_k b_k) = \big(\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k)\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n+1} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n+1} b_k\big)$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of multiplication; and if every $a_k \ge 0$ for $k < n+1$ then $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) a_n$ is a product of two nonnegatives, hence nonnegative, with the same argument giving positivity from positivity since $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1 > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L6]

3.1 Consequences of monotonicity, completing claim 4: monotonicity itself holds at every $n$, by the induction principle applied to the base case of step 1.1 and the successor step 2.3, so it is available for an arbitrary $n$ in what follows; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then comparing with the zero sequence gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge \sum_{k<n} 0 = 0$; for $j < n$ splitting at $j$ and then at $j+1$ writes $\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<j} a_k + a_j + \sum_{k=j+1}^{n-1} a_k$ with the first and third summands $\ge 0$, so $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$; and if moreover $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ then $0 \le a_j \le 0$ for every $j < n$, so $a_j = 0$. [step 1.1, step 2.3, step 1.3, L3, L4, L2]

4.1 By the induction principle claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and claim 3 was proved in step 1.3 with its consequences in step 3.1, so all six laws hold. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, step 2.5, step 1.3, step 3.1, L3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $r \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $r^k$ be the integer power ([[def-integer-power]]),
so that $r^0 = 1$ for every $r$, including $r = 0$.

1. If $|r| < 1$ then the series $\sum r^k$ converges ([[def-series]]) and
   $$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} r^{k} \;=\; \frac{1}{1-r} .$$
2. If $|r| \ge 1$ then $\sum r^k$ diverges.

The series starts at $k = 0$ and its first term is $r^0 = 1$; in particular
$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} 2^{-k} = 2$, while the series starting at $k = 1$ sums to
$1$. Which starting index is meant has to be said, and it is said here.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real number $r$, the integer powers $r^k$ ([[def-integer-power]]), and the partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} r^k$ of $\sum r^k$ ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[L1] Factorisation of a difference of powers: for $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and natural $n \ge 1$, $b^n - a^n = (b-a)\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a^k b^{\,n-1-k}$ ([[lem-power-difference-factorisation]]).

[L2] For $|r| < 1$ the sequence $(r^k)$ is null, that is $r^k \to 0$ ([[lem-geometric-sequence-null]]).

[L3] Algebra of limits: sums, differences and quotients of convergent sequences converge to the corresponding combination, the quotient rule requiring a nonzero limit and nonzero denominators ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L4] Absolute value: $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$, $|x| \ge 0$, and $|x| = 0$ exactly when $x = 0$; also $|1| = 1$, since $1 > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L5] Powers and order: $a^0 = 1$ for every $a$; if $a \ge 1$ and $n \ge 1$ then $a^n \ge a \ge 1$; and $1^n = 1$ for every $n$ ([[lem-power-monotone]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L6] The principle of induction ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L7] If a series converges then its terms tend to $0$ ([[lem-nth-term-test]]).

[L8] Notation of [[def-finite-sum]]: $\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x_k$ is $\sum_{k<n} x_k$, and the empty sum $\sum_{k<0} x_k$ is $0$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Assume $|r| < 1$. [assume-case lt]

1.2 Assume instead $|r| \ge 1$. [assume-case ge]

1.3 For every natural $n \ge 1$, applying [L1] with $b = 1$ and $a = r$ gives $1 - r^n = (1-r)\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} r^k \cdot 1^{\,n-1-k} = (1-r)\,s_n$, using $1^m = 1$ and the notation of [L8]. [L1, L5, L8]

1.4 At $n = 0$ the identity $1 - r^n = (1-r)s_n$ also holds, both sides being $0$ because $r^0 = 1$ and $s_0$ is the empty sum. [L5, L8]

2.1 In the case $|r| < 1$ we have $r \ne 1$, since $|1| = 1$ and $|r| < 1$; hence $1 - r \ne 0$. [step 1.1, L4, algebra]

2.2 In the case $|r| \ge 1$, an induction gives $|r^k| = |r|^k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$: at $k = 0$ both sides are $1$, and if $|r^k| = |r|^k$ then $|r^{k+1}| = |r^k \cdot r| = |r^k|\,|r| = |r|^k |r| = |r|^{k+1}$. [step 1.2, L4, L5, L6]

2.3 In the case $|r| \ge 1$ we get $|r|^k \ge 1$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$: at $k = 0$ this reads $1 \ge 1$, and for $k \ge 1$ it is the comparison $|r|^k \ge |r| \ge 1$. [step 1.2, L5]

3.1 In the case $|r| < 1$, dividing by $1 - r \ne 0$ gives $s_n = (1 - r^n)/(1-r)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.1, step 1.3, step 1.4, algebra]

3.2 In the case $|r| \ge 1$, combining the two previous steps gives $|r^k - 0| = |r^k| = |r|^k \ge 1$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.2, step 2.3]

4.1 In the case $|r| < 1$ the sequence $(r^n)$ is null, so $1 - r^n \to 1$ and therefore $s_n \to 1/(1-r)$, the denominator being the nonzero constant $1-r$; hence $\sum r^k$ converges with sum $1/(1-r)$, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 3.1, step 2.1, L2, L3]

4.2 In the case $|r| \ge 1$ the sequence $(r^k)$ does not converge to $0$, since the rational tolerance $\varepsilon = 1$ admits no index $K$ with $|r^k - 0| < 1$ for all $k \ge K$; so by the term test $\sum r^k$ diverges, which is claim 2. [step 3.2, L7]

5.1 The two cases $|r| < 1$ and $|r| \ge 1$ exhaust the possibilities, since the order on $\mathbb{R}$ is total, so claims 1 and 2 together cover every real $r$. [step 4.1, step 4.2, cases-exhaustive] ∎

## Remarks

- **The divergence half needs no separate treatment of $r = 1$ and $r = -1$.** Both are covered by $|r| \ge 1$, and the single reason is the same in every case: the terms have absolute value at least $1$, so they cannot tend to $0$. For $r = 1$ the partial sums are $s_n = n$ and run to $+\infty$; for $r = -1$ they oscillate between $0$ and $1$. The theorem says only that neither converges, which is all that "diverges" means here ([[def-series]]).

- **Why the identity is proved at $n = 0$ separately.** [[lem-power-difference-factorisation]] requires $n \ge 1$, since its right-hand side is a sum over $k < n$ of a term involving $b^{\,n-1-k}$, and $n-1$ is not a natural number at $n = 0$. The identity is still true at $n = 0$, but by inspection of two empty objects rather than by that lemma, and step 1.4 says so rather than letting the reader assume the citation covers it.

## Statement

$\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-equinumerous]]): the
plane of pairs of naturals is countably infinite ([[def-countable]]).

The bijection is exhibited, not merely asserted to exist. Define $2^m$ by
recursion on $m$ ([[thm-recursion]]) by $2^0 = 1$ and $2^{\sigma(m)} = 2^m + 2^m$,
and set

$$J(m,n) = 2^m \cdot \sigma(n + n), \qquad \text{that is} \qquad J(m,n) = 2^m(2n+1).$$

Then $J$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ onto
$\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, and $\sigma$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N}$ onto
$\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, so $\sigma^{-1} \circ J$ is a bijection
$\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$. What makes $J$ bijective is the
decomposition of a nonzero natural into a power of two times an odd number,
existence and uniqueness both.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Addition and multiplication on $\mathbb{N}$ with $m + 0 = m$, $m + \sigma(k) = \sigma(m + k)$, $m \cdot 0 = 0$ and $m \cdot \sigma(k) = m \cdot k + m$ ([[def-nat-addition]], [[def-nat-multiplication]]); $1 := \sigma(0)$. Call $k \in \mathbb{N}$ **even** if $k = j + j$ for some $j$ and **odd** if $k = \sigma(j + j)$ for some $j$.

[L1] Recursion: for a set $X$, $x_0 \in X$ and $F : X \to X$ there is $h : \mathbb{N} \to X$ with $h(0) = x_0$ and $h(\sigma(m)) = F(h(m))$ ([[thm-recursion]]).

[L2] Peano: $\sigma(k) \ne 0$ and $\sigma$ is injective ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]); every nonzero natural is a successor ([[lem-nat-nonzero-is-successor]]).

[L3] Arithmetic laws: $+$ and $\cdot$ are commutative and associative, $1 \cdot n = n = n \cdot 1$, $0 + n = n$, $a(b + c) = ab + ac$ and $\sigma(a) + n = \sigma(a + n)$ ([[lem-nat-add-commutative]], [[lem-nat-add-associative]], [[lem-nat-add-identity]], [[lem-nat-mult-commutative]], [[lem-nat-mult-associative]], [[lem-nat-mult-identity]], [[lem-nat-mult-distributive]], [[lem-nat-add-successor-left]]).

[L4] Order laws: exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds ([[lem-nat-trichotomy]]); $\le$ is reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive and total ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]), so $<$ is transitive and mixes with $\le$, in the sense that each of $a < b < c$, $a \le b < c$ and $a < b \le c$ gives $a < c$: transitivity of $\le$ gives $a \le c$ in every case, while $a = c$ would force $b = c$ or $a = b$ by antisymmetry, contradicting whichever of the two hypotheses is strict; and $<$ is irreflexive, because $a < a$ would demand $a \ne a$ ([[def-nat-order]]); $a \le b \iff a + k \le b + k$ and $a < b \iff a + k < b + k$ ([[lem-nat-order-add-compatible]]); $a < b \iff \sigma(a) \le b$, so $a < \sigma(a)$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]); and $a \le b$ means $a + c = b$ for some $c$ ([[def-nat-order]]), where moreover $a < b$ holds exactly when that $c$ is nonzero, since $c = 0$ gives $b = a$, while $c \ne 0$ with $a = b$ would give $c + a = a + c = a = 0 + a$ and hence $c = 0$ by additive cancellation ([[lem-nat-add-cancellative]], [[lem-nat-add-commutative]], [[lem-nat-add-identity]]).

[L5] Cancellation: $a \cdot k = b \cdot k$ with $k \ne 0$ gives $a = b$ ([[lem-nat-mult-cancellative]]); and $a \cdot b = 0$ forces $a = 0$ or $b = 0$ ([[lem-nat-no-zero-divisors]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Apply [L1] with $X = \mathbb{N}$, $x_0 = 1$ and $F(x) = x + x$: this defines $m \mapsto 2^m$ with $2^0 = 1$ and $2^{\sigma(m)} = 2^m + 2^m$ for all $m$. [L1, construct]

1.2 Every natural is even or odd: by induction, $0 = 0 + 0$ is even; and if $k = j + j$ is even then $\sigma(k) = \sigma(j + j)$ is odd, while if $k = \sigma(j + j)$ is odd then $\sigma(k) = \sigma(\sigma(j+j)) = \sigma(\sigma(j) + j) = \sigma(j) + \sigma(j)$ is even, using $\sigma(j) + j = \sigma(j + j)$ and $x + \sigma(y) = \sigma(x + y)$. [L3, L6, given]

1.3 No natural is both even and odd, that is $j + j \ne \sigma(i + i)$ for all $i, j$: if $j \le i$ then $j + j \le i + j = j + i \le i + i < \sigma(i + i)$; if $i < j$ then $\sigma(i) \le j$, so $\sigma(i+i) < \sigma(\sigma(i+i)) = \sigma(\sigma(i) + i) = \sigma(i) + \sigma(i) \le j + j$; in both cases the two sides differ by irreflexivity of $<$. [L3, L4, given]

1.4 $\sigma$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N}$ onto $\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$: it is injective by [L2], its values are nonzero by [L2], and every nonzero natural is a value of $\sigma$ by [L2]. [L2, L7]

2.1 $2^m \ne 0$ for every $m$: by induction, $2^0 = \sigma(0) \ne 0$; and if $2^m \ne 0$ then $2^m = \sigma(a)$ for some $a$ by [L2], so $2^{\sigma(m)} = 2^m + 2^m = 2^m + \sigma(a) = \sigma(2^m + a) \ne 0$. [step 1.1, L2, L6, given]

2.2 $2^{m + d} = 2^m \cdot 2^d$ for all $m, d$: by induction on $d$, at $d = 0$ both sides are $2^m$ since $m + 0 = m$ and $2^m \cdot 1 = 2^m$; and if $2^{m+d} = 2^m \cdot 2^d$ then $2^{m + \sigma(d)} = 2^{\sigma(m+d)} = 2^{m+d} + 2^{m+d} = 2^m 2^d + 2^m 2^d = 2^m (2^d + 2^d) = 2^m \cdot 2^{\sigma(d)}$. [step 1.1, L3, L6, given]

3.1 Define $J : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ by $J(m,n) = 2^m \cdot \sigma(n+n)$. Its values are nonzero: $2^m \ne 0$ by step 2.1 and $\sigma(n+n) \ne 0$ by [L2], so $J(m,n) \ne 0$ by [L5]. Thus $J$ maps into $\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L2, L5, construct]

4.1 $J$ is injective. Suppose $2^m \sigma(n+n) = 2^{m'} \sigma(n'+n')$; by [L4] we may assume $m \le m'$, the other case being symmetric, and write $m' = m + d$. By step 2.2 the right side is $2^m (2^d \sigma(n'+n'))$, so cancelling the nonzero factor $2^m$ with [L5] and [L3] gives $\sigma(n+n) = 2^d \cdot \sigma(n'+n')$. If $d \ne 0$ then $d = \sigma(e)$ by [L2] and $2^d = 2^e + 2^e$, so the right side equals $w + w$ with $w = 2^e \sigma(n'+n')$, by [L3]; that would make $\sigma(n+n)$ both odd and even, contradicting step 1.3. Hence $d = 0$ and $m' = m$, and then $\sigma(n+n) = \sigma(n'+n')$ gives $n + n = n' + n'$ by injectivity of $\sigma$, whence $n = n'$ because $n < n'$ would force $n + n < n' + n = n + n' < n' + n'$ by [L4] and [L3], and symmetrically for $n' < n$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, L2, L3, L4, L5]

4.2 $J$ is surjective onto $\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$: by strong induction [L6] we show every $k$ is $0$ or a value of $J$. Let $k \ne 0$ and assume the claim for all $j < k$. By step 1.2, $k$ is odd or even. If $k = \sigma(j+j)$ then $k = 1 \cdot \sigma(j+j) = 2^0 \sigma(j+j) = J(0,j)$ by [L3]. If $k = j + j$ then $j \ne 0$, since $j = 0$ would give $k = 0$; also $j < j + j = k$ by [L4], because $j + j = k$ with $j \ne 0$; so the hypothesis at $j$ and $j \ne 0$ give $j = 2^m \sigma(n+n)$ for some $m, n$, and then $k = j + j = 2^m \sigma(n+n) + 2^m \sigma(n+n) = (2^m + 2^m) \sigma(n+n) = 2^{\sigma(m)} \sigma(n+n) = J(\sigma(m), n)$ by [L3] and step 1.1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 3.1, L3, L4, L6]

5.1 Therefore $J$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ onto $\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, and composing with the inverse of the bijection $\sigma$ of step 1.4 yields the bijection $\sigma^{-1} \circ J : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$; hence $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \approx \mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ is countably infinite. [step 1.4, step 4.1, step 4.2, L7] ∎

## Remarks

- Written out, $\sigma^{-1}(J(m,n)) = 2^m(2n+1) - 1$, the standard bijection. The detour through $\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$ avoids subtraction, which the naturals do not have as a total operation.

- The proof is a proof of unique factorisation into a power of two times an odd number: step 4.2 is existence and step 4.1 is uniqueness. Nothing weaker would do, and no appeal to a picture of the diagonal enumeration is made anywhere. Nothing here uses any choice principle.

- The Cantor pairing polynomial $(m,n) \mapsto \tfrac{(m+n)(m+n+1)}{2} + n$ is an alternative bijection. It is not used because halving is not available in $\mathbb{N}$ without first developing division with remainder, whereas doubling, which is all $2^m$ needs, is immediate from addition.

## Statement

Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals with $a_k \ge 0$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$,
let $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ be its partial sums and let
$S = \{\, s_n : n \in \mathbb{N} \,\}$ be the range of $(s_n)$ ([[def-series]]).
Then:

1. $(s_n)$ is nondecreasing ([[def-monotone-sequence]]) and $s_n \ge 0$ for every
   $n$;
2. $\sum a_k$ converges **if and only if** $S$ is bounded above
   ([[def-bounded-set]]), and in that case
   $$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k \;=\; \sup S ,$$
   so in particular $s_n \le \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k$ for every $n$;
3. if $S$ is not bounded above then $s_n \to +\infty$
   ([[def-divergence-to-infinity]]) and $\sum a_k$ diverges.

This is the theorem that makes the nonnegative theory work: for terms of one
sign, convergence is a boundedness question and no candidate limit is ever
needed. Every comparison test on this page is an application of it.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(a_k)$ of reals with $a_k \ge 0$ for every $k$, its partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$, and the range $S = \{s_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L1] The recursion clause of the finite sum: $s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ ([[def-finite-sum]]).

[L2] Consecutive comparisons suffice for monotonicity: $(x_k)$ is nondecreasing if and only if $x_k \le x_{k+1}$ for every $k$; and a nondecreasing sequence is bounded below by its first term ([[def-monotone-sequence]]).

[L3] Monotonicity of finite sums: if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L4] A monotone sequence converges if and only if it is bounded, that is if and only if there is $M$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for every $k$ ([[cor-monotone-converges-iff-bounded]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L5] A nondecreasing sequence bounded above converges to the supremum of its range, which exists by the least-upper-bound property ([[thm-monotone-convergence]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L6] A nondecreasing sequence whose range is not bounded above diverges to $+\infty$ ([[lem-monotone-unbounded-diverges]], [[def-divergence-to-infinity]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For every $n$, $s_{n+1} - s_n = a_n \ge 0$, so $s_n \le s_{n+1}$ and $(s_n)$ is nondecreasing. [given, L1, L2]

1.2 For every $n$, $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, all terms being nonnegative. [given, L3]

2.1 Claim 1 is steps 1.1 and 1.2 together. [step 1.1, step 1.2]

2.2 Since $s_n \ge 0$ we have $|s_n| = s_n$, so $(s_n)$ is bounded in the sense of [L4] if and only if $S$ is bounded above. [step 1.2, L4]

3.1 By [L4] applied to the monotone sequence $(s_n)$, the series converges if and only if $(s_n)$ is bounded, hence if and only if $S$ is bounded above. [step 1.1, step 2.2, L4]

4.1 If $S$ is bounded above then $(s_n)$ converges to $\sup S$, so $\sum a_k$ converges with sum $\sup S$; and since $\sup S$ is an upper bound of $S$, $s_n \le \sup S$ for every $n$. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L5]

4.2 If $S$ is not bounded above then $s_n \to +\infty$, and by step 3.1 the series diverges. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L6]

5.1 The equivalence and the identification of the sum as the supremum together make claim 2, and the divergence statement is claim 3. [step 3.1, step 4.1, step 4.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **"Bounded" and "bounded above" coincide here, and only here.** The equivalence used in step 2.2 rests on $s_n \ge 0$, which rests on every term being nonnegative. For a series with terms of both signs the partial sums can be bounded above and still fail to converge, so nothing in this theorem survives the loss of the sign hypothesis. That failure is exhibited by [[cex-comparison-needs-nonnegativity]] on the companion page.

- **Claim 3 is a strictly stronger statement than "diverges".** Divergence alone permits oscillation ([[def-series]]); for nonnegative terms it cannot occur, and the partial sums necessarily run to $+\infty$. This is what licenses the phrase "the series diverges to $+\infty$" for nonnegative terms, and it is what the Abel-Dini theorem later on this page uses.

- **This criterion is the monotone convergence property, worn differently.** The proof above is monotone convergence for $\mathbb{R}$ applied to the nondecreasing sequence of partial sums, and nothing is lost going back the other way. Given a nondecreasing sequence $(x_n)$ of reals, put $y_n := x_n - x_0 \ge 0$ and let $a_0 := 0$, $a_{k+1} := y_{k+1} - y_k \ge 0$; then $s_{n+1} = y_n$ ([[def-series]]), the partial sums are bounded exactly when $(x_n)$ is bounded above, and claim 1 returns the convergence of $(y_n)$ and so of $(x_n)$. Testing boundedness of partial sums is therefore not a device special to series. Read in the vocabulary of [[def-completeness-properties]] it is the property (MCT), which in an arbitrary ordered field already forces the Archimedean property on its own ([[lem-mct-implies-archimedean]]) and with it the least-upper-bound property ([[lem-mct-implies-lub]]). The translation just given is carried out in $\mathbb{R}$, since [[def-series]] is stated for sequences of reals and this library defines no series over a general ordered field.
