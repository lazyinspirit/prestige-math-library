## Statement

Suppose $\iota(n+1)a_n\to0$. For every $\varepsilon>0$ there is $N_0$ such that, whenever $q\ge p\ge N_0$,

$$\sum_{n=p}^{q}|a_n|\le\varepsilon\frac{\iota(q-p+1)}{\iota(p+1)}.$$

Moreover, for $N\ge N_0$ and $x_N:=1-1/\iota(N+1)$,

$$\sum_{n=N_0}^{N}|a_n|(1-x_N^n)\le\varepsilon,\qquad \sum_{n>N}|a_n|x_N^n\le\varepsilon.$$

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The Tauber condition $\iota(n+1)a_n\to0$.

[L1] The canonical naturals $\iota(n+1)$ are positive and strictly increasing, positive reciprocals reverse order, and $|uv|=|u||v|$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L2] Real-sequence convergence is tested with positive rational tolerances, and below every positive real lies a positive rational ([[def-real-limit]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L3] For $0\le x\le1$, multiplying out the finite sum gives $1-x^n=(1-x)\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}x^k\le\iota(n)(1-x)$.

[L4] For $0\le x<1$, the geometric-series formula gives $\sum_{n>N}x^n=x^{N+1}/(1-x)$ ([[thm-geometric-series]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Choose a positive rational $\delta<\varepsilon$. By the limit hypothesis and [L2], choose $N_0$ so that $|\iota(n+1)a_n|<\delta$ for $n\ge N_0$. Positivity and multiplicativity in [L1] give $|a_n|<\delta/\iota(n+1)<\varepsilon/\iota(n+1)$ there. Since $1/\iota(n+1)\le1/\iota(p+1)$ on $p\le n\le q$, summing proves the block estimate. [L1, L2, choose, algebra]

2.1 For $N_0\le n\le N$, [L3] gives $|a_n|(1-x_N^n)\le\varepsilon(1-x_N)$. There are at most $N+1$ terms and $\iota(N+1)(1-x_N)=1$, proving the first weighted estimate. [step 1.1, L3, algebra]

3.1 For $n>N$, step 1.1 gives $|a_n|\le\varepsilon/\iota(N+2)$. Summing the geometric tail yields $\sum_{n>N}|a_n|x_N^n\le\varepsilon x_N^{N+1}\iota(N+1)/\iota(N+2)\le\varepsilon$. [step 1.1, L4, algebra] ∎

## Definition

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]) with additive identity $0_F$ and
multiplicative identity $1_F$. Define
$\iota : \mathbb{N} \to F$ by recursion on $\mathbb{N}$
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[thm-recursion]]):

$$\iota(0) \;:=\; 0_F, \qquad \iota(n+1) \;:=\; \iota(n) + 1_F .$$

$\iota(n)$ is the **canonical natural** of $n$ in $F$. It is also written
$n \cdot 1_F$, and for $n \ge 1$ it is $1_F$ added to itself $n$ times.

**Why the notation is needed at all.** A natural number in this library is a von
Neumann natural, that is a set ([[def-natural-numbers]]), and a set is not an
element of $F$. So $1/n$, $n^{\alpha}$ and $x/n$ are not expressions of $F$ when
$n$ is a natural: what they mean is $1/\iota(n)$, $\iota(n)^{\alpha}$ and
$x/\iota(n)$. The map $\iota$ is what carries a counting number into the field,
and writing it is the whole reason a reader meets $1/\iota(k+1)$ where an
informal text would write $1/(k+1)$.

## Remarks

- **Where the index shift comes from.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
  ([[def-natural-numbers]]) and $\iota(0) = 0_F$, so $1/\iota(k)$ is undefined at
  $k = 0$. A family of reciprocals indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ is therefore written
  over $\iota(k+1)$, which is why the harmonic and telescoping families of this
  library run over $k+1$ rather than over $k$. This is bookkeeping, not a
  restriction: the values are the usual ones.

- **This definition records notation; the arithmetic is proved elsewhere.** That
  $\iota$ is strictly increasing and positive on $n \ge 1$, and that it carries
  sums to sums and products to products, is [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], stated
  for an ordered field. That lemma introduces the same element by the equivalent
  recursion $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, which
  agrees with the definition above because $\iota(1) = \iota(0) + 1_F = 1_F$.
  Nothing here is new mathematics; the definition exists so that the notation has
  a home a reader can look up.

- **The symbol $\iota$ is used in this library for other canonical maps, and this
  definition does not govern them.** It also denotes the canonical field
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to F$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), the isometric
  embedding of a metric space into a completion ([[def-metric-completion]]), and
  an inclusion map $\iota : S \to X$ of a subspace. Each of those is introduced
  where it is used and means something different from the map defined here. What
  the four share is only that each is the canonical map of its situation.

- **Fields, not just ordered fields.** The recursion needs no order, so the
  definition is stated for a field; every use in this library is in an ordered
  field, and the order is what makes $\iota$ injective
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). In a field of positive characteristic $\iota$
  is not injective, which is one reason the injectivity is a lemma rather than
  part of the definition.

## Definition

A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals **converges** to $x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for
every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with
$|x_k - x| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$. It is **Cauchy** when for
every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with
$|x_k - x_l| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$.

## Remarks

- Quantifying over rational $\varepsilon$ loses nothing: below any real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ lies a positive rational ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).
- $|\cdot|$ is the absolute value of [[def-real-order]].

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$, with
$|x|$ the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]). Then

$$|x| \ge 0; \quad |x| = 0 \iff x = 0; \quad -|x| \le x \le |x|; \quad |-x| = |x|; \quad |xy| = |x|\,|y|;$$

and, for every $c > 0$, one has $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and elements $x, y \in F$.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| = u$ if $u \ge 0$, and $|u| = -u$ if $u < 0$ ([[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Ordered-field order: trichotomy holds (for each $u$ exactly one of $u > 0$, $u = 0$, $u < 0$), $a < b$ means $b - a$ is positive, and sums and products of positives are positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Signs in products: $(-a)b = -(ab)$ and $(-a)(-b) = ab$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] Sign rules: a product of two elements of the same sign is positive, and a product of two elements of opposite sign is negative ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Case $x > 0$: by [L1] $|x| = x > 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; since $-x < 0$ we get $|-x| = -(-x) = x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -x < 0 < x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case pos, L1, L2, algebra]

1.2 Case $x = 0$: then $|x| = |0| = 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ holds with $|x| = 0$ and $x = 0$, while $|-x| = |0| = |x|$ and $-|x| = 0 \le 0 \le 0 = |x|$. [assume-case zero, L1]

1.3 Case $x < 0$: by [L1] $|x| = -x$, and [L2] gives $-x > 0$, so $|x| > 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; here $|-x| = -x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -(-x) = x \le x$ while $x < 0 < -x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case neg, L1, L2, algebra]

1.4 Case $x = 0$ or $y = 0$: then $xy = 0$, so $|xy| = 0$, and one of $|x|, |y|$ is $0$, whence $|x|\,|y| = 0 = |xy|$. [assume-case zerofactor, L1]

1.5 Case $x, y$ have the same sign (both positive or both negative): by [L4] $xy > 0$, so $|xy| = xy$, while $|x|\,|y| = xy$ by [L3] (for $x, y < 0$ this is $(-x)(-y) = xy$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case same, L1, L3, L4]

1.6 Case $x, y$ have opposite signs (one positive, one negative): by [L4] $xy < 0$, so $|xy| = -(xy)$, while $|x|\,|y| = -(xy)$ by [L3] (namely $x(-y)$ or $(-x)y$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case opposite, L1, L3, L4]

2.1 By trichotomy [L2] each $x$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.1-1.3, and in each we verified $|x| \ge 0$, that $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$, that $|-x| = |x|$, and that $-|x| \le x \le |x|$; hence all four hold for every $x$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, cases-exhaustive]

2.2 By trichotomy [L2] each pair $x, y$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.4-1.6, and in each $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$ for all $x, y$. [step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6, cases-exhaustive]

3.1 Let $c > 0$: if $|x| < c$ then $-c < -|x| \le x \le |x| < c$ by [step 2.1] and [L2], so $-c < x < c$; conversely if $-c < x < c$ then both $x < c$ and $-x < c$, and since $|x|$ equals $x$ or $-x$ by [L1], we get $|x| < c$, so $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$. [step 2.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b \in F$.

1. If $a > 0$ then $a^{-1} > 0$.
2. If $0 < a < b$ then $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b \in F$.

[L1] $x > 0 \iff x \in P$; $x < 0 \iff -x \in P$; and for $x \neq 0$ exactly one of $x \in P$, $-x \in P$ holds ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Sign rules: a product of a positive and a negative is negative, a product of two positives is positive, and for $c > 0$ one has $a < b \iff ac < bc$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

[L3] $0 < 1$; in particular $1 \neq 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L4] $P$ is closed under addition, so $<$ is transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a > 0$, so $a \neq 0$ and its inverse $a^{-1}$ exists with $a \cdot a^{-1} = 1$; moreover $a^{-1} \neq 0$, since $a^{-1}$ has $a$ as its inverse while $0$ is non-invertible ($1 \neq 0$ by L3). [assume-hyp, L1, L3]

2.1 By trichotomy $a^{-1} \in P$ or $-a^{-1} \in P$; if $-a^{-1} \in P$, then $a > 0$ and $a^{-1} < 0$ give $a \cdot a^{-1} < 0$ by the sign rules, i.e. $1 < 0$, contradicting $0 < 1$; hence $a^{-1} \in P$, i.e. $a^{-1} > 0$, proving claim 1. [step 1.1, L2, L3, L1]

3.1 Assume $0 < a < b$; then $0 < b$ by transitivity, so by claim 1 both $a^{-1} > 0$ and $b^{-1} > 0$, and the sign rules give $a^{-1} b^{-1} > 0$. [assume-hyp, step 2.1, L4, L2, L1]

4.1 Multiplying $a < b$ by the positive $a^{-1} b^{-1}$ via the sign rules gives $a (a^{-1} b^{-1}) < b (a^{-1} b^{-1})$; since $a a^{-1} = 1$ and $b b^{-1} = 1$, this simplifies to $b^{-1} < a^{-1}$. [step 3.1, L2, algebra]

5.1 Together with $b^{-1} > 0$ from step 3.1, we conclude $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$, proving claim 2. [step 3.1, step 4.1] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field, with field structure as in [[def-field]], and for
$n \ge 1$ let $n \cdot 1_F$ denote the canonical natural number
$\underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$, defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$
and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$. Then for every $n \ge 1$:

- $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$;
- the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$;
- $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ and $(mn) \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F)$ for all $m, n \ge 1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ whose canonical naturals are defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, with $0 \cdot 1_F = 0$.

[L1] $0 < 1_F$ in every ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] The order is compatible with addition and positives are closed under addition: $a < b$ implies $a + c < b + c$, and $a > 0$, $b > 0$ imply $a + b > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 1$: by definition $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, and $1_F > 0$. [L1, base]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: assume $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for some fixed $n \ge 1$. [ih]

1.3 By the recursion, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F - n \cdot 1_F = 1_F > 0$, so $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$. [given, L1]

1.4 Additive identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ by the recursion, and if $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ then $(m+n+1) \cdot 1_F = (m+n) \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + (n+1) \cdot 1_F$. [given, algebra]

2.1 Inductive step: $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ is a sum of two positives, by the hypothesis and $1_F > 0$, hence $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Iterating 1.3, for $m < n$ one has $m \cdot 1_F < n \cdot 1_F$, so $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing and therefore injective on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$. [step 1.3, L2]

2.3 Multiplicative identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m \cdot 1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(1 \cdot 1_F)$, and the step $(m(n+1)) \cdot 1_F = (mn + m) \cdot 1_F = (mn) \cdot 1_F + m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F) + (m \cdot 1_F)(1_F) = (m \cdot 1_F)((n+1) \cdot 1_F)$ uses 1.4 and distributivity. [step 1.4, algebra]

3.1 By induction on 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for every $n \ge 1$; with the strict increase 2.2 and the identities 1.4, 2.3, every claim holds. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 1.4, step 2.3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

The map $q \mapsto \hat q$ ([[def-real-numbers]]) is an embedding of ordered
fields. Every real is approximated by rationals: for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and
rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ with
$|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$. Consequently, strictly between any two
reals lies a rational.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real $x = [(a_n)]$ and a rational $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] The orders of $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}$; ordered-field arithmetic ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Field arithmetic in $\mathbb{Q}$: $\varepsilon/2, \delta/4$ are positive rationals, and every nonzero rational $q$ has a reciprocal $1/q$ with $q \cdot (1/q) = 1$ ([[thm-rat-field]]).

[L3] Cauchy definition ([[def-rational-cauchy-sequence]]).

[L4] Real positivity via eventual rational lower bounds ([[def-real-order]]).

[L5] $\mathbb{R} = \mathcal{C}/\mathcal{N}$ is a field ([[thm-reals-field]]), and $0_{\mathbb{R}} = \hat 0$, $1_{\mathbb{R}} = \hat 1$ are the classes of the constant sequences ([[def-real-numbers]]). A multiplicative inverse there is unique: if $ab = 1_{\mathbb{R}} = ac$ then $b = b(ac) = (ba)c = c$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Embedding: constant sequences are Cauchy; $\hat q = \hat r$ iff the constant $q - r$ is null iff $q = r$; operations match termwise; and $q < r$ gives the constant lower bound $r - q > 0$, so $\hat q < \hat r$ and order is preserved and reflected. [L1, L4]

1.2 Fix $N$ with $|a_m - a_n| < \varepsilon/2$ for all $m, n \ge N$, and set $q = a_N$. [L3, L2]

2.1 The difference $\hat q - x$ has representative $(a_N - a_n)$ with $|a_N - a_n| < \varepsilon/2$ for $n \ge N$; hence both $\hat\varepsilon - (x - \hat q)$ and $\hat\varepsilon - (\hat q - x)$ have representatives eventually $> \varepsilon/2$, so both are positive: $|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$. [step 1.2, L4, L1]

2.2 Inverses: let $q$ be a nonzero rational. Then $\hat q \ne \hat 0 = 0_{\mathbb{R}}$ by the injectivity of step 1.1, and $1/q$ exists in $\mathbb{Q}$ by [L2]; since the operations match termwise (step 1.1), $\hat q \cdot \widehat{1/q} = \widehat{q \cdot (1/q)} = \hat 1 = 1_{\mathbb{R}}$. Inverses in $\mathbb{R}$ are unique by [L5], so $(\hat q)^{-1} = \widehat{1/q}$: the embedding preserves reciprocals. [step 1.1, L2, L5]

3.1 Density: let $x < y$; pick $\delta > 0$ rational and $N$ with the representative of $y - x$ eventually $> \delta$; set $\varepsilon = \delta/4$ and pick $q$ with $|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$; then $q' = q + 2\varepsilon$ satisfies $\hat q' - x \ge -\hat\varepsilon + 2\hat\varepsilon = \hat\varepsilon > 0$ and $y - \hat q' \ge \hat\delta - \hat\varepsilon - 2\hat\varepsilon = \hat\delta/4 > 0$, so $x < \hat q' < y$. [step 2.1, L4, L1, L2]

4.1 The rationals embed as an ordered subfield — injectively, preserving the order in both directions, the ring operations, and reciprocals — and they approximate every real arbitrarily well and separate any two reals. [step 1.1, step 2.2, step 3.1] ∎

## Statement

Let $r \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $r^k$ be the integer power ([[def-integer-power]]),
so that $r^0 = 1$ for every $r$, including $r = 0$.

1. If $|r| < 1$ then the series $\sum r^k$ converges ([[def-series]]) and
   $$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} r^{k} \;=\; \frac{1}{1-r} .$$
2. If $|r| \ge 1$ then $\sum r^k$ diverges.

The series starts at $k = 0$ and its first term is $r^0 = 1$; in particular
$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} 2^{-k} = 2$, while the series starting at $k = 1$ sums to
$1$. Which starting index is meant has to be said, and it is said here.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real number $r$, the integer powers $r^k$ ([[def-integer-power]]), and the partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} r^k$ of $\sum r^k$ ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[L1] Factorisation of a difference of powers: for $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and natural $n \ge 1$, $b^n - a^n = (b-a)\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a^k b^{\,n-1-k}$ ([[lem-power-difference-factorisation]]).

[L2] For $|r| < 1$ the sequence $(r^k)$ is null, that is $r^k \to 0$ ([[lem-geometric-sequence-null]]).

[L3] Algebra of limits: sums, differences and quotients of convergent sequences converge to the corresponding combination, the quotient rule requiring a nonzero limit and nonzero denominators ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L4] Absolute value: $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$, $|x| \ge 0$, and $|x| = 0$ exactly when $x = 0$; also $|1| = 1$, since $1 > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L5] Powers and order: $a^0 = 1$ for every $a$; if $a \ge 1$ and $n \ge 1$ then $a^n \ge a \ge 1$; and $1^n = 1$ for every $n$ ([[lem-power-monotone]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L6] The principle of induction ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L7] If a series converges then its terms tend to $0$ ([[lem-nth-term-test]]).

[L8] Notation of [[def-finite-sum]]: $\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x_k$ is $\sum_{k<n} x_k$, and the empty sum $\sum_{k<0} x_k$ is $0$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Assume $|r| < 1$. [assume-case lt]

1.2 Assume instead $|r| \ge 1$. [assume-case ge]

1.3 For every natural $n \ge 1$, applying [L1] with $b = 1$ and $a = r$ gives $1 - r^n = (1-r)\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} r^k \cdot 1^{\,n-1-k} = (1-r)\,s_n$, using $1^m = 1$ and the notation of [L8]. [L1, L5, L8]

1.4 At $n = 0$ the identity $1 - r^n = (1-r)s_n$ also holds, both sides being $0$ because $r^0 = 1$ and $s_0$ is the empty sum. [L5, L8]

2.1 In the case $|r| < 1$ we have $r \ne 1$, since $|1| = 1$ and $|r| < 1$; hence $1 - r \ne 0$. [step 1.1, L4, algebra]

2.2 In the case $|r| \ge 1$, an induction gives $|r^k| = |r|^k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$: at $k = 0$ both sides are $1$, and if $|r^k| = |r|^k$ then $|r^{k+1}| = |r^k \cdot r| = |r^k|\,|r| = |r|^k |r| = |r|^{k+1}$. [step 1.2, L4, L5, L6]

2.3 In the case $|r| \ge 1$ we get $|r|^k \ge 1$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$: at $k = 0$ this reads $1 \ge 1$, and for $k \ge 1$ it is the comparison $|r|^k \ge |r| \ge 1$. [step 1.2, L5]

3.1 In the case $|r| < 1$, dividing by $1 - r \ne 0$ gives $s_n = (1 - r^n)/(1-r)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.1, step 1.3, step 1.4, algebra]

3.2 In the case $|r| \ge 1$, combining the two previous steps gives $|r^k - 0| = |r^k| = |r|^k \ge 1$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.2, step 2.3]

4.1 In the case $|r| < 1$ the sequence $(r^n)$ is null, so $1 - r^n \to 1$ and therefore $s_n \to 1/(1-r)$, the denominator being the nonzero constant $1-r$; hence $\sum r^k$ converges with sum $1/(1-r)$, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 3.1, step 2.1, L2, L3]

4.2 In the case $|r| \ge 1$ the sequence $(r^k)$ does not converge to $0$, since the rational tolerance $\varepsilon = 1$ admits no index $K$ with $|r^k - 0| < 1$ for all $k \ge K$; so by the term test $\sum r^k$ diverges, which is claim 2. [step 3.2, L7]

5.1 The two cases $|r| < 1$ and $|r| \ge 1$ exhaust the possibilities, since the order on $\mathbb{R}$ is total, so claims 1 and 2 together cover every real $r$. [step 4.1, step 4.2, cases-exhaustive] ∎

## Remarks

- **The divergence half needs no separate treatment of $r = 1$ and $r = -1$.** Both are covered by $|r| \ge 1$, and the single reason is the same in every case: the terms have absolute value at least $1$, so they cannot tend to $0$. For $r = 1$ the partial sums are $s_n = n$ and run to $+\infty$; for $r = -1$ they oscillate between $0$ and $1$. The theorem says only that neither converges, which is all that "diverges" means here ([[def-series]]).

- **Why the identity is proved at $n = 0$ separately.** [[lem-power-difference-factorisation]] requires $n \ge 1$, since its right-hand side is a sum over $k < n$ of a term involving $b^{\,n-1-k}$, and $n-1$ is not a natural number at $n = 0$. The identity is still true at $n = 0$, but by inspection of two empty objects rather than by that lemma, and step 1.4 says so rather than letting the reader assume the citation covers it.
