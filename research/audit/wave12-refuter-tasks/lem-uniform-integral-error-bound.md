## Statement

Let $u,v\in\mathbb{R}$, and let $f$ and $g$ be integrable between $u$ and $v$.
If $\eta\ge0$ and

$$|f(x)-g(x)|\le\eta$$

throughout the closed interval with endpoints $u$ and $v$, then

$$\left|\int_u^v f-\int_u^v g\right|\le \eta\,|v-u|.$$

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $u,v$, functions $f,g$ integrable between them, and a real $\eta\ge0$ with $|f-g|\le\eta$ on the interval between them.

[L1] Linear combinations of integrable functions are integrable and their integrals are the corresponding linear combinations, including for oriented limits ([[thm-linearity-of-the-integral]], [[def-oriented-integral]]).

[L2] If $a<b$, an integrable function $h$ satisfying $m\le h(x)\le M$ on $[a,b]$ has $m(b-a)\le\int_a^b h\le M(b-a)$ ([[thm-monotonicity-of-the-integral]]).

[L3] For every real $z$, $-|z|\le z\le|z|$ and $|-z|=|z|$; for $c>0$, $|z|<c$ exactly when $-c<z<c$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 If $u=v$, both oriented integrals are $0$ and the asserted inequality holds. [L1, algebra]

1.2 Suppose $u<v$ and put $h:=f-g$. Then $h$ is integrable and $\int_u^v h=\int_u^v f-\int_u^v g$. [L1]

2.1 The hypothesis gives $|h(x)|\le\eta$, while [L3] gives $-|h(x)|\le h(x)\le|h(x)|$; hence $-\eta\le h(x)\le\eta$ on $[u,v]$, and [L2] gives $-\eta(v-u)\le\int_u^v h\le\eta(v-u)$. [step 1.2, L2, L3]

3.1 Hence $\left|\int_u^v f-\int_u^v g\right|=\left|\int_u^v h\right|\le\eta(v-u)$ when $u<v$. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L3]

4.1 If $u>v$, apply step 3.1 to the ordered pair $(v,u)$ and use antisymmetry of oriented integrals; the same bound results because $|u-v|=|v-u|$. [step 3.1, L1, L3]

5.1 The alternatives $u=v$, $u<v$, and $u>v$ are exhaustive, and steps 1.1, 3.1, and 4.1 give the claimed inequality. [step 1.1, step 3.1, step 4.1] ∎

## Definition

**Why this item is first.** The published definition of the integral does not
cover this page. [[def-darboux-integral]] is stated for reals $a < b$, because
the partitions it quantifies over are those of [[def-partition-and-refinement]],
whose standing hypothesis is $a < b$: with $a = b$ the chain
$a = t_0 < \dots < t_n = b$ is unsatisfiable. So $\int_a^b f$ is an undefined
symbol whenever $a \ge b$, and every additivity statement below would be
ill-formed as it is usually written. This item extends the notation, and nothing
else: the object it names is still the Darboux integral of
[[def-darboux-integral]].

Let $u, v \in \mathbb{R}$ and write

$$[u \wedge v,\ u \vee v] \;:=\; \text{the closed interval with endpoints } u \text{ and } v$$

([[def-interval]]). Let $f$ be a real-valued function whose domain contains that
interval. Say that **$f$ is integrable between $u$ and $v$** when either $u = v$,
or $u \ne v$ and the restriction of $f$ to $[u \wedge v,\ u \vee v]$ is bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]) and Darboux integrable there ([[def-darboux-integral]],
[[def-darboux-sums]]). For such $f$ define

$$\int_u^v f \;:=\; \begin{cases} \text{the Darboux integral of } f \text{ over } [u,v] & \text{if } u < v, \\[2pt] 0 & \text{if } u = v, \\[2pt] -\displaystyle\int_v^u f & \text{if } u > v. \end{cases}$$

**There is nothing to check for consistency.** The three clauses are indexed by
the three cases of trichotomy, $u < v$, $u = v$ and $u > v$, which are mutually
exclusive and exhaustive; no pair of them ever applies to the same $(u,v)$. In
particular the first clause is untouched, so on $u < v$ this is the published
integral verbatim and every published theorem about it applies unchanged.

**The middle clause is a stipulation, not a computation.** It is *not* claimed
that $0$ is a value forced by the $u < v$ definition in any limiting sense; that
definition simply says nothing at $u = v$, and $\int_u^u f := 0$ is what is
written there. It is also unconditional: no hypothesis on $f$ beyond being
defined at $u$ is asked for, since the case $u = v$ never refers to a partition.

### The two consequences used throughout the page

**Antisymmetry, for every pair.** For all reals $u, v$ with $f$ integrable
between them,

$$\int_u^v f \;=\; -\int_v^u f .$$

Indeed if $u < v$ then $v > u$ and the third clause reads
$\int_v^u f = -\int_u^v f$, which rearranges to the display; if $u = v$ both
sides are $0$; and if $u > v$ the third clause is the display itself.

**Absolute values agree.** Consequently
$\bigl|\int_u^v f\bigr| = \bigl|\int_v^u f\bigr|$ for every such pair.

**An obligation recorded here and discharged elsewhere.** With this convention
the additivity identity

$$\int_u^v f \;+\; \int_v^w f \;=\; \int_u^w f$$

holds for **every** arrangement of $u, v, w$ in an interval on which $f$ is
integrable, not only for $u < v < w$. That is a theorem and not part of this
definition; it is proved as the last clause of
[[thm-additivity-over-subintervals]], and nothing on this page uses it before it
is proved there.

## Remarks

- **This is notation, and it is a real notation.** Without it the substitution
  theorem could not be stated with the limits $\varphi(c)$ and $\varphi(d)$ in
  the order the map produces them, since a differentiable $\varphi$ need be
  neither injective nor monotone; and the integral function $x \mapsto \int_a^x f$
  would be undefined at $x = a$.

- **One published inequality is not orientation-invariant, and that is a trap.**
  The estimate $\bigl|\int_u^v f\bigr| \le \int_u^v |f|$ is guaranteed only
  for $u \le v$: at $u > v$ the right-hand side is $-\int_v^u |f| \le 0$ while
  the left-hand side is $\ge 0$, so the inequality fails whenever
  $\int_v^u |f| > 0$. The form valid for every pair is
  $\bigl|\int_u^v f\bigr| \le \bigl|\int_u^v |f|\bigr|$, and this is stated where
  it is proved ([[cor-integrability-of-absolute-values-products-and-lattice-operations]]).

- **Integrability is a property of the unordered pair.** By construction, $f$ is
  integrable between $u$ and $v$ if and only if it is integrable between $v$ and

  remembers the order.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$, with
$|x|$ the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]). Then

$$|x| \ge 0; \quad |x| = 0 \iff x = 0; \quad -|x| \le x \le |x|; \quad |-x| = |x|; \quad |xy| = |x|\,|y|;$$

and, for every $c > 0$, one has $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and elements $x, y \in F$.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| = u$ if $u \ge 0$, and $|u| = -u$ if $u < 0$ ([[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Ordered-field order: trichotomy holds (for each $u$ exactly one of $u > 0$, $u = 0$, $u < 0$), $a < b$ means $b - a$ is positive, and sums and products of positives are positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Signs in products: $(-a)b = -(ab)$ and $(-a)(-b) = ab$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] Sign rules: a product of two elements of the same sign is positive, and a product of two elements of opposite sign is negative ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Case $x > 0$: by [L1] $|x| = x > 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; since $-x < 0$ we get $|-x| = -(-x) = x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -x < 0 < x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case pos, L1, L2, algebra]

1.2 Case $x = 0$: then $|x| = |0| = 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ holds with $|x| = 0$ and $x = 0$, while $|-x| = |0| = |x|$ and $-|x| = 0 \le 0 \le 0 = |x|$. [assume-case zero, L1]

1.3 Case $x < 0$: by [L1] $|x| = -x$, and [L2] gives $-x > 0$, so $|x| > 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; here $|-x| = -x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -(-x) = x \le x$ while $x < 0 < -x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case neg, L1, L2, algebra]

1.4 Case $x = 0$ or $y = 0$: then $xy = 0$, so $|xy| = 0$, and one of $|x|, |y|$ is $0$, whence $|x|\,|y| = 0 = |xy|$. [assume-case zerofactor, L1]

1.5 Case $x, y$ have the same sign (both positive or both negative): by [L4] $xy > 0$, so $|xy| = xy$, while $|x|\,|y| = xy$ by [L3] (for $x, y < 0$ this is $(-x)(-y) = xy$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case same, L1, L3, L4]

1.6 Case $x, y$ have opposite signs (one positive, one negative): by [L4] $xy < 0$, so $|xy| = -(xy)$, while $|x|\,|y| = -(xy)$ by [L3] (namely $x(-y)$ or $(-x)y$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case opposite, L1, L3, L4]

2.1 By trichotomy [L2] each $x$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.1-1.3, and in each we verified $|x| \ge 0$, that $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$, that $|-x| = |x|$, and that $-|x| \le x \le |x|$; hence all four hold for every $x$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, cases-exhaustive]

2.2 By trichotomy [L2] each pair $x, y$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.4-1.6, and in each $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$ for all $x, y$. [step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6, cases-exhaustive]

3.1 Let $c > 0$: if $|x| < c$ then $-c < -|x| \le x \le |x| < c$ by [step 2.1] and [L2], so $-c < x < c$; conversely if $-c < x < c$ then both $x < c$ and $-x < c$, and since $|x|$ equals $x$ or $-x$ by [L1], we get $|x| < c$, so $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$. [step 2.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]). Then:

1. $f + g$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ and
   $\int_a^b (f+g) = \int_a^b f + \int_a^b g$;
2. for every real $\lambda$, $\lambda f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ and
   $\int_a^b \lambda f = \lambda \int_a^b f$;
3. consequently, for all reals $\lambda, \mu$ the function $\lambda f + \mu g$ is
   integrable and
   $$\int_a^b(\lambda f + \mu g) \;=\; \lambda\int_a^b f \;+\; \mu\int_a^b g ;$$
4. the same identity holds with oriented limits: if $u, v \in [a,b]$ and $f, g$
   are integrable between $u$ and $v$ ([[def-oriented-integral]]), then
   $\int_u^v(\lambda f + \mu g) = \lambda\int_u^v f + \mu\int_u^v g$.

**Linearity of the integral is not linearity of the Darboux sums**, and the
proof of claim 1 has to squeeze rather than compute. On a subinterval the
inequality $\sup(f+g) \le \sup f + \sup g$ can be strict — take $f(x) = x$ and
$g(x) = -x$ on $[0,1]$, where the left side is $0$ and the right side is $1$ —
so $U(f+g,P)$ is in general strictly below $U(f,P) + U(g,P)$ and no identity
between upper sums is available. Claim 2, by contrast, is an identity at the
level of the sums, with the roles of $\sup$ and $\inf$ exchanged when
$\lambda < 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, integrable $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, reals $\lambda, \mu$, and a real $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] Riemann's criterion: a bounded $h$ on $[a,b]$ is integrable if and only if for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a partition $P$ with $U(h,P) - L(h,P) < \eta$ ([[thm-riemann-criterion]]).

[L2] For every partition $P$ and bounded $h$: $L(h,P) \le \underline{\int_a^b} h \le \overline{\int_a^b} h \le U(h,P)$, and $h$ is integrable exactly when the two integrals agree, their common value being $\int_a^b h$; the lower integral is $\sup_P L(h,P)$ and the upper is $\inf_P U(h,P)$ ([[def-darboux-integral]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L3] $L(h,P) = \sum_{i<n} m_i(h)\Delta_i$ and $U(h,P) = \sum_{i<n}M_i(h)\Delta_i$, where $m_i(h) = \inf h[I_i]$ and $M_i(h) = \sup h[I_i]$ over the subintervals $I_i$ of $P = (n,t)$, with $\Delta_i > 0$; an integrable function is bounded, and a sum of two bounded functions and a scalar multiple of a bounded function are bounded ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L4] If $P'$ refines $P$ then $L(h,P) \le L(h,P') \le U(h,P') \le U(h,P)$; the common refinement $P_1 \vee P_2$ refines both ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L5] Finite sums are additive and homogeneous: $\sum_{i<n}(x_i + y_i) = \sum_{i<n}x_i + \sum_{i<n}y_i$ and $\sum_{i<n}\lambda x_i = \lambda\sum_{i<n}x_i$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], clauses 1 and 2).

[L6] A supremum is the least upper bound and an infimum the greatest lower bound; both exist for a nonempty bounded set and are unique ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-infimum]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L7] Reflection: writing $-S = \{-s : s \in S\}$, a real $u$ is an upper bound of $S$ exactly when $-u$ is a lower bound of $-S$, and conversely; hence $\sup(-S) = -\inf S$ and $\inf(-S) = -\sup S$ for nonempty bounded $S$, by [L6] ([[lem-reflection]]).

[L8] The constant function $0$ is integrable with $\int_a^b 0 = 0$ ([[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]]).

[L9] Ordered-field arithmetic: adding a constant and multiplying by a positive quantity preserve an inequality, the order is total and transitive, and a real $x$ with $|x| < \eta$ for every real $\eta > 0$ is $0$ ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order facts are used in their nonstrict form as well, obtained by adjoining the case of equality.

[L10] With oriented limits, $\int_v^u h = -\int_u^v h$ and $\int_u^u h = 0$ ([[def-oriented-integral]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $f$, $g$, $f+g$ and $\lambda f$ are bounded on $[a,b]$, so all their Darboux sums and integrals are defined. [given, L3]

1.2 For every partition $P = (n,t)$ and every $i < n$: $f(x) + g(x) \le M_i(f) + M_i(g)$ for $x \in I_i$, so $M_i(f) + M_i(g)$ is an upper bound of $(f+g)[I_i]$ and $M_i(f+g) \le M_i(f) + M_i(g)$ by [L6]; dually $m_i(f+g) \ge m_i(f) + m_i(g)$. [L3, L6]

1.3 Fix partitions $P_1$ and $P_2$ with $U(f,P_1) - L(f,P_1) < \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$ and $U(g,P_2) - L(g,P_2) < \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$, and put $P := P_1 \vee P_2$. [given, L1, L4, choose]

1.4 **Claim 2, the case $\lambda = 0$.** Then $\lambda f$ is the constant function $0$, integrable with integral $0 = 0 \cdot \int_a^b f$. [L8]

1.5 **Claim 2, the case $\lambda > 0$.** For every partition $P$ and every $i < n$, $\lambda M_i(f)$ is an upper bound of $(\lambda f)[I_i]$, and any upper bound $w$ of $(\lambda f)[I_i]$ gives the upper bound $w/\lambda$ of $f[I_i]$, whence $M_i(f) \le w/\lambda$ and $\lambda M_i(f) \le w$; so $M_i(\lambda f) = \lambda M_i(f)$ by [L6], and dually $m_i(\lambda f) = \lambda m_i(f)$. [L3, L6, L9]

1.6 **Claim 2, the case $\lambda = -1$.** For every $P$ and $i < n$, $(-f)[I_i] = -\bigl(f[I_i]\bigr)$, so $M_i(-f) = -m_i(f)$ and $m_i(-f) = -M_i(f)$ by [L7]. [L3, L7]

2.1 By [L4], $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1}$ and $U(g,P) - L(g,P) < \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$. [step 1.3, L4]

2.2 Summing the inequalities of step 1.2 over $i < n$ against the positive weights $\Delta_i$ and using [L5] gives $L(f,P) + L(g,P) \le L(f+g,P) \le U(f+g,P) \le U(f,P) + U(g,P)$. [step 1.2, L3, L5, L9]

2.3 With step 1.5 and [L5], $U(\lambda f,P) = \lambda U(f,P)$ and $L(\lambda f, P) = \lambda L(f,P)$ for $\lambda > 0$; hence $U(\lambda f,P)-L(\lambda f,P) = \lambda\bigl(U(f,P)-L(f,P)\bigr)$, which [L1] makes smaller than any prescribed positive number by choosing $P$ suitably, so $\lambda f$ is integrable. [step 1.5, L1, L3, L5, L9]

2.4 With step 1.6 and [L5], $U(-f,P) = -L(f,P)$ and $L(-f,P) = -U(f,P)$, so $U(-f,P)-L(-f,P) = U(f,P)-L(f,P)$ and $-f$ is integrable by [L1]; and by [L7] applied to the sets of Darboux sums, $\overline{\int_a^b}(-f) = -\underline{\int_a^b} f$ and $\underline{\int_a^b}(-f) = -\overline{\int_a^b} f$, so $\int_a^b(-f) = -\int_a^b f$. [step 1.6, L1, L2, L5, L7]

3.1 Hence $U(f+g,P) - L(f+g,P) \le \bigl(U(f,P)-L(f,P)\bigr) + \bigl(U(g,P)-L(g,P)\bigr) < \varepsilon$, so $f+g$ is integrable by [L1], $\varepsilon > 0$ having been arbitrary. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, L1, L9]

3.2 Moreover the set of lower sums of $\lambda f$ is $\lambda$ times the set of lower sums of $f$, and a supremum scales by a positive factor, by the argument of step 1.5 applied to that set; so $\underline{\int_a^b}\lambda f = \lambda \underline{\int_a^b} f$, and likewise for the upper integrals, giving $\int_a^b \lambda f = \lambda\int_a^b f$. [step 1.5, step 2.3, L2, L6, L9]

4.1 Both $\int_a^b(f+g)$ and $\int_a^b f + \int_a^b g$ lie in the interval from $L(f,P)+L(g,P)$ to $U(f,P)+U(g,P)$: the first by [L2] and step 2.2, the second by [L2] applied to $f$ and to $g$ separately. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, L2]

4.2 **Claim 2 for $\lambda < 0$.** Then $-\lambda > 0$ and $\lambda f = (-\lambda)(-f)$, so steps 2.3, 2.4 and 3.2 give integrability and the required identities and $\int_a^b \lambda f = (-\lambda)\int_a^b(-f) = (-\lambda)\bigl(-\int_a^b f\bigr) = \lambda\int_a^b f$. [step 2.3, step 3.2, step 2.4, L9]

5.1 That interval has length less than $\varepsilon$ by step 2.1, so $\bigl|\int_a^b(f+g) - \int_a^b f - \int_a^b g\bigr| < \varepsilon$; as $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary the difference is $0$, which is claim 1. [step 2.1, step 4.1, L9]

5.2 Claim 2 is now proved in all three cases $\lambda = 0$, $\lambda > 0$ and $\lambda < 0$, which are exhaustive by trichotomy. [step 1.4, step 2.3, step 3.2, step 4.2, L9]

6.1 **Claim 3.** By claim 2 the functions $\lambda f$ and $\mu g$ are integrable with integrals $\lambda\int_a^b f$ and $\mu\int_a^b g$, and by claim 1 their sum is integrable with the sum of those integrals. [step 5.1, step 5.2]

7.1 **Claim 4.** If $u < v$ then $u, v \in [a,b]$ and claim 3 applies verbatim on $[u,v]$; if $u = v$ both sides are $0$ by [L10]; and if $u > v$ then applying the case $u < v$ to the pair $(v,u)$ and multiplying by $-1$ gives the identity, by [L10]. [step 6.1, L10] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why claim 1 cannot be an identity of Darboux sums.** The example in the statement shows $\sup(f+g) < \sup f + \sup g$ is possible on a single subinterval, so $U(f+g,P) = U(f,P)+U(g,P)$ is false in general. What survives is the pair of inequalities of step 1.2, and they are enough because the gap between them is squeezed to $0$ by [[thm-riemann-criterion]].

- **The two scalar cases really are different.** For $\lambda > 0$ the extreme values scale; for $\lambda < 0$ they are exchanged, because multiplying by a negative reverses the order ([[lem-reflection]]). Merging the cases and writing $U(\lambda f, P) = \lambda U(f,P)$ for all $\lambda$ would be false at $\lambda = -1$, where the correct identity is $U(-f,P) = -L(f,P)$.

- **The set of integrable functions on $[a,b]$ is closed under the operations named here and under more.** Products, absolute values and the lattice operations are also integrable, but none of them is obtained from linearity alone: the proofs of [[cor-integrability-of-absolute-values-products-and-lattice-operations]] all pass through [[thm-composition-with-a-continuous-function]], with linearity used only to recombine the pieces.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]). Then:

1. **Nonnegativity.** If $f(x) \ge 0$ for every $x \in [a,b]$ then
   $\int_a^b f \ge 0$.
2. **Monotonicity.** If $f(x) \le g(x)$ for every $x \in [a,b]$ then
   $$\int_a^b f \;\le\; \int_a^b g .$$
3. **Two-sided bound.** If $m \le f(x) \le M$ for every $x \in [a,b]$, with
   $m, M$ real, then
   $$m\,(b-a) \;\le\; \int_a^b f \;\le\; M\,(b-a) .$$

**Equality in claim 1 does not force $f$ to vanish.** A nonnegative integrable
function with integral $0$ may be positive at infinitely many points; that is
[[fs-nonnegative-integrable-with-zero-integral-vanishes]] on the previous page's
companion. Under the additional hypothesis of continuity the conclusion does
hold, and that is [[thm-nonnegative-continuous-with-zero-integral-vanishes]]
below.

**Claim 2 is stated for $a < b$ and is not orientation-invariant.** With the
convention of [[def-oriented-integral]], $f \le g$ gives
$\int_u^v f \le \int_u^v g$ when $u \le v$ and the reverse inequality when
$u \ge v$, since both sides change sign together.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and integrable $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, with reals $m \le M$ where claim 3 is concerned.

[A1] $f(x) \ge 0$ for every $x \in [a,b]$.

[A2] $f(x) \le g(x)$ for every $x \in [a,b]$.

[A3] $m \le f(x) \le M$ for every $x \in [a,b]$.

[L1] If $m' \le h \le M'$ on $[a,b]$ then $m'(b-a) \le L(h,P) \le \underline{\int_a^b} h \le \overline{\int_a^b} h \le U(h,P) \le M'(b-a)$ for every partition $P$ ([[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]], [[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L2] If $h$ is integrable then $\int_a^b h$ is the common value of the lower and upper integrals ([[def-darboux-integral]], [[def-infimum]]).

[L3] Sums and scalar multiples of integrable functions are integrable, and $\int_a^b(\lambda h + \nu k) = \lambda\int_a^b h + \nu\int_a^b k$ ([[thm-linearity-of-the-integral]]).

[L4] Ordered-field arithmetic: adding a constant to both sides of an inequality preserves it, and the order is total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). The nonstrict forms follow from the strict ones by adjoining the case of equality.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Claim 1.** Under [A1] the constant $0$ is a lower bound of $f$ on $[a,b]$, so [L1] applies with $m' := 0$ and gives $\underline{\int_a^b} f \ge 0$. [A1, L1]

1.2 **Claim 2.** Under [A2] the function $h := g - f$ satisfies $h(x) \ge 0$ for every $x \in [a,b]$, and $h$ is integrable with $\int_a^b h = \int_a^b g - \int_a^b f$ by [L3]. [A2, L3, L4]

2.1 Since $f$ is integrable, $\int_a^b f = \underline{\int_a^b} f \ge 0$ by [L2]. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 By claim 1 applied to $h$, $\int_a^b g - \int_a^b f \ge 0$, that is $\int_a^b f \le \int_a^b g$. [step 2.1, step 1.2, L4]

4.1 **Claim 3.** Under [A3], [L1] applied to $f$ with $m' := m$ and $M' := M$ gives $m(b-a) \le \underline{\int_a^b} f$ and $\overline{\int_a^b} f \le M(b-a)$, and both integrals equal $\int_a^b f$ by [L2]. [A3, L1, L2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Claim 3 is cited, not reproved.** [[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]] already proves the five-term chain for every partition, and it is the item that also computes the integral of a constant, $\int_a^b c = c(b-a)$. Claim 3 is that chain read at an integrable $f$; nothing new is established here.

- **Claim 2 is proved through claim 1 and linearity, and not by comparing Darboux sums.** Comparing sums works too, since $f \le g$ gives $m_i(f) \le m_i(g)$ and $M_i(f) \le M_i(g)$ on every subinterval, but the route through $g - f$ is shorter and uses only results already available. Either way the hypothesis is a pointwise inequality on the *whole* of $[a,b]$; an inequality holding off a finite set gives the same conclusion, by [[lem-changing-a-function-at-finitely-many-points]], and that is a separate statement.

- **What claim 2 is for.** It is what turns a pointwise estimate on an integrand into an estimate on the integral, and every estimate of that shape on this page and its companion is an application of it. No count of those applications is asserted here; the dependency graph of the page is where that is read off.
