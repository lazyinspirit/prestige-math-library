## Example

Take $n = 2$ and $m = 6$, and let $a := 1/\sqrt{\iota(2)}$, so that
$u := (a,a) \in \mathbb{R}^{2}$ has $\lVert u\rVert_2 = \sqrt{a^{2}+a^{2}} = 1$.
Define $v : 6 \to \mathbb{R}^{2}$ by

$$v_0 := e_0, \quad v_1 := -e_1, \quad v_2 := u, \quad v_3 := -e_0, \quad v_4 := e_1, \quad v_5 := -u ,$$

with $e_0 = (1,0)$ and $e_1 = (0,1)$ ([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]]). Every
$\lVert v_i\rVert_2$ is $1$ and $\sum_{i<6}v_i = 0$, so
[[thm-steinitz-polygonal-confinement]] applies and asserts an ordering all of
whose partial sums have norm at most $\iota(2)$.

**A good ordering.** The identity ordering works: the partial sums
$s_k = \sum_{j<k}v_j$ are

$$s_0 = (0,0), \quad s_1 = (1,0), \quad s_2 = (1,-1), \quad s_3 = (1+a,\ a-1), \quad s_4 = (a,\ a-1), \quad s_5 = (a,a), \quad s_6 = (0,0),$$

with norms $0$, $1$, $\sqrt{\iota(2)}$, $\sqrt{\iota(3)}$,
$\sqrt{\iota(2)-\sqrt{\iota(2)}}$, $1$, $0$, each at most $\iota(2)$.

**A bad ordering, which exceeds the bound.** Reordering as
$e_0, e_1, u, -e_0, -e_1, -u$ gives the third partial sum $(1+a,\ 1+a)$, whose
norm squared is $\iota(3)+\iota(2)\sqrt{\iota(2)} > \iota(4)$. So that ordering
has a partial sum of norm strictly greater than $\iota(2)$, and the theorem is
saying something.

**One step of the descending construction.** With $b^{6}$ the identity of $6$ and
$\mu^{6}_j := \iota(4)/\iota(6)$ for $j<6$, the pair $(b^{6},\mu^{6})$ is
admissible at $k = 6$ in the sense of the proof of
[[thm-steinitz-polygonal-confinement]]. At the next stage the feasible set is

$$\Lambda \;=\; \Bigl\{\, \mu \in [0,1]^{6} \;:\; \sum_{j<6}\mu_j v_j = 0,\ \sum_{j<6}\mu_j = \iota(3) \,\Bigr\},$$

and $\mu := \bigl(1,\ \tfrac{1}{\iota(2)},\ 0,\ 1,\ \tfrac{1}{\iota(2)},\ 0\bigr)$
lies in it with exactly **two** coordinates strictly between $0$ and $1$, which
is the least possible. Its support is $\{0,1,3,4\}$, of size $4 \le k-1 = 5$, so
the support bound holds with room; dropping the coordinate $j_0 = 5$ gives the
admissible pair at $k = 5$ with $b^{5} = (0,1,2,3,4)$ and
$\mu^{5} = \bigl(1,\ \tfrac{1}{\iota(2)},\ 0,\ 1,\ \tfrac{1}{\iota(2)}\bigr)$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The list $v : 6 \to \mathbb{R}^{2}$ above, with $a = 1/\sqrt{\iota(2)}$ and $u = (a,a)$; the partial sums $s_k = \sum_{j<k}v_j$ of the identity ordering; the vector $\mu = \bigl(1, 1/\iota(2), 0, 1, 1/\iota(2), 0\bigr)$.

[L1] $\lVert y\rVert_2 = \sqrt{y_0^{2}+y_1^{2}}$ on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, and it is a norm ([[def-p-norms-on-rn]], [[def-euclidean-inner-product]], [[def-norm-and-normed-space]], [[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]]).

[L2] Square roots: $\sqrt{c}$ is the unique nonnegative $s$ with $s^{2} = c$; $\bigl(\sqrt{\iota(2)}\bigr)^{2} = \iota(2)$; and for $c,d \ge 0$, $c \le d$ exactly when $\sqrt{c} \le \sqrt{d}$ ([[thm-of-square-roots]], [[lem-of-square-monotone]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L3] Canonical naturals are positive and strictly increasing and carry sums to sums and products to products ([[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]); inverses of positives are positive ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

[L4] Finite sums in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ are computed pointwise, with the recursion $\sum_{j<k+1}y_j = \sum_{j<k}y_j + y_k$ ([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]] clause 1, [[def-linear-combination-and-span]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[L5] Steinitz's polygonal confinement theorem, its notion of an admissible pair, and its support bound ([[thm-steinitz-polygonal-confinement]], [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

## Verification

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $a^{2} = 1/\iota(2)$ by [L2], so $\lVert u\rVert_2^{2} = a^{2}+a^{2} = 1$ and $\lVert u\rVert_2 = 1$; also $\lVert e_0\rVert_2 = \lVert e_1\rVert_2 = 1$ and $\lVert -y\rVert_2 = \lVert y\rVert_2$. Hence $\lVert v_i\rVert_2 = 1$ for every $i<6$. [L1, L2, L3]

1.2 $\sum_{i<6}v_i = (e_0 - e_0) + (-e_1 + e_1) + (u - u) = 0$, computing coordinatewise. [L4]

1.3 For the ordering $e_0, e_1, u, -e_0, -e_1, -u$ the third partial sum is $(1+a, 1+a)$, whose norm squared is $\iota(2)(1+a)^{2} = \iota(2) + \iota(2)\iota(2)a + \iota(2)a^{2} = \iota(3) + \iota(2)\sqrt{\iota(2)}$, using $\iota(2)a = \iota(2)/\sqrt{\iota(2)} = \sqrt{\iota(2)}$. [L1, L2, L3]

1.4 The vector $\mu = \bigl(1, 1/\iota(2), 0, 1, 1/\iota(2), 0\bigr)$ lies in $\Lambda$: its values lie in $[0,1]$; $\sum_{j<6}\mu_j = 1 + 1/\iota(2) + 0 + 1 + 1/\iota(2) + 0 = \iota(3)$; and $\sum_{j<6}\mu_j v_j = (v_0 + v_3) + \bigl(1/\iota(2)\bigr)(v_1+v_4) = 0 + 0 = 0$. [L3, L4]

2.1 The partial sums of the identity ordering are as displayed, by the recursion of [L4] applied coordinatewise. [step 1.2, L4]

2.2 Since $\sqrt{\iota(2)} > 1$ and $\iota(2) > 0$, the quantity of step 1.3 exceeds $\iota(3)+\iota(2) = \iota(5) > \iota(4)$, so that partial sum has norm strictly greater than $\iota(2)$: a bad ordering really does break the bound. [step 1.3, L2, L3]

2.3 The pair $(b^{6},\mu^{6})$ with $b^{6}$ the identity of $6$ and $\mu^{6}_j = \iota(4)/\iota(6)$ is admissible at $6$: the values lie in $[0,1]$, $\sum_{j<6}\mu^{6}_j v_j = \bigl(\iota(4)/\iota(6)\bigr)\sum_{j<6}v_j = 0$, and $\sum_{j<6}\mu^{6}_j = \iota(6)\cdot\iota(4)/\iota(6) = \iota(4)$. [step 1.2, L3, L4, L5]

2.4 No element of $\Lambda$ has fewer than two strictly fractional coordinates. If none were fractional, $\mu$ would be a $\{0,1\}$-vector with $\sum_j\mu_j = \iota(3)$, hence with support of size $3$, and $\sum_{j \in \operatorname{supp}}v_j = 0$; the support cannot contain a pair $\{0,3\}$, $\{1,4\}$ or $\{2,5\}$, since the remaining single vector would then have to be $0$ while all six are nonzero, so it contains exactly one index from each pair and the sum is $\pm e_0 \pm e_1 \pm u$, whose second coordinate is $\pm 1 \pm a$ and whose first is $\pm 1 \pm a$, and $|{\pm}1 \pm a| \ne 0$ because $a \ne 1$ (indeed $a^{2} = 1/\iota(2) \ne 1$). If exactly one coordinate were fractional, say with value $t$, then $\sum_j \mu_j$ would be $t$ plus a canonical natural and could not equal $\iota(3)$. [step 1.4, L1, L2, L3]

3.1 Their norms squared are $0$, $1$, $\iota(2)$, $(1+a)^{2}+(a-1)^{2} = \iota(2)+\iota(2)a^{2} = \iota(3)$, $a^{2}+(a-1)^{2} = \iota(2) - \iota(2)a$, $\iota(2)a^{2} = 1$ and $0$. [step 2.1, L1, L2, L3]

3.2 So $\mu$ of step 1.4 is a minimiser, its support is $\{0,1,3,4\}$ of size $4$, and $4 \le 5 = k-1$ at $k = 6$: the support bound of [L5] holds, and a coordinate with value $0$ exists, for instance $j_0 = 5$. [step 1.4, step 2.4, L5]

4.1 Each of these is at most $\iota(4)$: the largest is $\iota(3)$, and $\iota(2)-\iota(2)a \le \iota(2)$ because $a > 0$. So every partial sum of the identity ordering has norm at most $\sqrt{\iota(4)} = \iota(2)$, and the identity ordering realises the bound of [L5]. [step 3.1, L2, L3, L5]

4.2 Deleting position $5$ gives $b^{5} = (0,1,2,3,4)$ and $\mu^{5} = \bigl(1, 1/\iota(2), 0, 1, 1/\iota(2)\bigr)$, with $\sum_{j<5}\mu^{5}_j = \iota(3)$ and $\sum_{j<5}\mu^{5}_j v_{b^{5}(j)} = 0$: an admissible pair at $k = 5$. [step 1.4, step 3.2, L4, L5]

5.1 Steps 4.1, 2.2 and 4.2 give, in turn, an ordering realising the bound, an ordering violating it, and one traced step of the descending construction with its support bound checked. [step 4.1, step 2.2, step 4.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **The bound $\iota(n)$ is not attained here.** The largest partial-sum norm of the good ordering is $\sqrt{\iota(3)}$, comfortably below $\iota(2)$. The theorem asserts existence of an ordering below $\iota(n)$ and claims no sharpness, and this example makes no claim about the optimal constant either.

- **What the bad ordering shows.** Without the theorem there is no reason to expect any ordering to stay bounded independently of $m$: the third partial sum of the bad ordering already exceeds $\iota(2)$, and lists of many unit vectors summing to $0$ can be ordered so that a partial sum has norm of order $m$.

- **Why one step of the construction is traced.** An example that only asserted the bound would say nothing about how it is obtained. The step above exhibits the object the proof actually manipulates — a feasible vector of coefficients with as few fractional coordinates as possible — and checks the support bound $\#\operatorname{supp} \le k-1$ that the descending construction turns on.

For $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ put $$\\lVert x\\rVert_p \\;:=\\; \\Bigl(\\sum_{k<n} |x_k|^{p}\\Bigr)^{1/p},$$ where $|\\cdot|$ is the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]), the sum is the finite sum of [[def-finite-sum]], and both powers are the **rational** powers of [[def-rational-power]]. **Every power written here is defined.** Each base $|x_k|$ is a nonnegative real and $p > 0$, so $|x_k|^{p}$ is given by [[def-rational-power]] for $|x_k| > 0$ and by its supplementary clause $0^{p} = 0$ for $|x_k| = 0$; the sum of these nonnegative terms is nonnegative ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 4), and $1/p$ is a positive rational, so the outer power is defined for the same two reasons. The value does not depend on which representative of $p$ or of $1/p$ is used ([[lem-rational-power-well-defined]]). **The exponent is a rational, and that is not a matter of taste.** [[def-rational-power]] supplies $a^{r}$ for a nonnegative base and a **rational** exponent only; real exponents do not exist at this point in the reading order, and [[rem-real-exponents-deferred]] records exactly why. This is also why the published Minkowski inequality [[thm-minkowski-finite]], which is what makes the triangle inequality work below, is itself stated for rational $p \\ge 1$. **No statement on this page is written for $p$ ranging over a real interval.** ### The maximum norm For $n \\ge 1$ and $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ put $$\\lVert x\\rVert_\\infty \\;:=\\; \\max\\{\\, |x_k| \\;:\\; k < n \\,\\},$$ the maximum of a nonempty finite set of reals, which exists and is one of its elements ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]). **The hypothesis $n \\ge 1$ is required and propagates.** At $n = 0$ the set $\\{|x_k| : k<n\\}$ is empty and has no maximum ([[def-max-min]]). This is the same restriction the published [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] carries, for the same reason, and **every statement on this page that mentions $\\lVert\\cdot\\rVert_\\infty$ inherits it**. The $p$-norms for rational $p \\ge 1$ carry no such restriction: at $n = 0$ each is the empty sum raised to a positive rational power, hence $0$. ### The three cases the rest of the page uses - $\\lVert x\\rVert_1 = \\sum_{k<n}|x_k|$, since $t^{1} = t$ for $t \\ge 0$ ([[lem-rational-power-laws]], and $0^{1} = 0$ by the supplementary clause). - $\\lVert x\\rVert_2 = \\bigl(\\sum_{k<n}|x_k|^{2}\\bigr)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{k<n}x_k^{2}}$, which is exactly the Euclidean norm of [[def-euclidean-inner-product]]: the exponent $2$ agrees with the integer power, so $|x_k|^{2} = x_k^{2}$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]), and $t^{1/2}$ is the unique nonnegative square root of $t$, which is $\\sqrt{t}$ ([[def-rational-power]], [[thm-of-square-roots]]). **The two notations denote the same function and no second Euclidean norm is introduced.** - $\\lVert x\\rVert_\\infty$ as above, for $n \\ge 1$. That each of these is a norm in the sense of [[def-norm-and-normed-space]], and that the metrics they induce are exactly the published $d_1$, $d_2$ and $d_\\infty$ of [[lem-metrics-on-rn]], is [[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]]; it is proved there and is not assumed here.",

We write $x_k := x(k)$ for $k < n$, and two elements of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are equal exactly when they agree at every $k < n$. This is the same set that [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] calls $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The **Euclidean inner product** of $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the real number $$\\langle x, y\\rangle \\;:=\\; \\sum_{k<n} x_k\\,y_k ,$$ the finite sum of [[def-finite-sum]] applied to the list $k \\mapsto x_k y_k$ (extended by $0$ beyond $n$, as every finite list in this library is). The **Euclidean norm** of $x$ is $$\\lVert x\\rVert_2 \\;:=\\; \\sqrt{\\langle x, x\\rangle},$$ which is defined because $\\langle x,x\\rangle = \\sum_{k<n} x_k^{2} \\ge 0$ (a sum of nonnegative terms, [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 4 and [[lem-of-square-positive]], the case $x_k = 0$ giving $x_k^2 = 0$ by [[def-integer-power]]) and every nonnegative real has a unique nonnegative square root ([[thm-of-square-roots]]). ### Both are defined for every $n$, including $n = 0$ At $n = 0$ the set $\\mathbb{R}^{0}$ has exactly one element, the empty function, and it is the zero vector space ([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]] clause 5); the sum above is the empty sum, so $\\langle x,y\\rangle = 0$ and $\\lVert x\\rVert_2 = 0$. **This is the first place on this page where the two index regimes diverge, and the divergence is deliberate.** The published metrics $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_\\infty$ of [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] are defined only for $n \\ge 1$, because $d_\\infty$ would otherwise be a maximum over the empty index set; the algebra above needs no such restriction. The boundary in this page runs between the algebra and the metric, not where a reader would guess, and [[rem-rn-conventions-and-scope]] lists exactly which items inherit $n \\ge 1$. ### The algebra of the inner product For all $x, y, z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$: 1. **Symmetry.** $\\langle x,y\\rangle = \\langle y,x\\rangle$, since $x_ky_k = y_kx_k$ termwise. 2. **Additivity in the first argument.** $\\langle x + y, z\\rangle = \\langle x,z\\rangle + \\langle y,z\\rangle$: the list $k \\mapsto (x_k+y_k)z_k$ is the termwise sum of $k \\mapsto x_kz_k$ and $k \\mapsto y_kz_k$, so [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 1 applies. 3. **Homogeneity in the first argument.** $\\langle \\lambda x, y\\rangle = \\lambda\\langle x,y\\rangle$, by [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 2. 4. **Bilinearity.** Clauses 2 and 3 together with symmetry give the same two laws in the second argument. 5. **Positive definiteness.** $\\langle x,x\\rangle \\ge 0$, and $\\langle x,x\\rangle = 0$ if and only if $x = 0$. Indeed a vanishing sum of nonnegative terms has every term $0$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 4), so $x_k^{2} = 0$ for every $k < n$, and a nonzero real has a positive square ([[lem-of-square-positive]]), whence $x_k = 0$ for every $k < n$ and $x = 0$. 6. **Agreement with the published Euclidean metric.** For $n \\ge 1$ and $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, $\\lVert x - y\\rVert_2 = \\sqrt{\\sum_{k<n}(x_k-y_k)^{2}} = d_2(x,y)$, the two sides being the same expression ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]]). In particular $\\lVert x\\rVert_2 = d_2(x, 0)$. That $\\lVert\\cdot\\rVert_2$ is a norm in the sense of [[def-norm-and-normed-space]] is proved in [[thm-cauchy-schwarz-and-the-euclidean-norm]], where the triangle inequality is obtained from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality; it is not assumed here.",

Let $V$ be a vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$, with zero vector $0_V$. A **norm on $V$** is a function $N : V \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that for all $u, v \\in V$ and all $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$: - **(N1) Separation.** $N(v) = 0$ if and only if $v = 0_V$. - **(N2) Absolute homogeneity.** $N(\\lambda v) = |\\lambda|\\,N(v)$, the absolute value being that of [[def-abs-value]]. - **(N3) Triangle inequality.** $N(u + v) \\le N(u) + N(v)$. A **normed space** is a pair $(V, N)$ consisting of a vector space $V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ and a norm $N$ on it. When only one norm is in play we write $\\lVert v\\rVert$ for $N(v)$; when several are, the norm is always named. **The values of a norm are real numbers.** The codomain is $\\mathbb{R}$, so $N(v)$ is an honest element of the complete ordered field and no infinite value is permitted. This is the same convention [[rem-metric-axiom-conventions]] records for metrics. ### Nonnegativity is a theorem, not an axiom Many texts add a fourth condition $N(v) \\ge 0$. It is redundant. Applying (N2) with $\\lambda = -1$ gives $N(-v) = |-1|\\,N(v) = N(v)$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]] for $(-1)v = -v$), and then (N3) with $u = v$ and $-v$ gives $$0 \\;=\\; N(0_V) \\;=\\; N\\bigl(v + (-v)\\bigr) \\;\\le\\; N(v) + N(-v) \\;=\\; N(v) + N(v),$$ where $N(0_V) = 0$ is (N1).

Hence $N(v) \\ge 0$ for every $v \\in V$. **Consequently the verification of a candidate norm has three things to check and not four**, exactly as the verification of a candidate metric has three and not four ([[def-metric-space]], [[lem-metric-nonnegativity]]). No item in this library assumes nonnegativity of a norm before the argument above. ### The induced metric Let $N$ be a norm on $V$ and define $$d_N(u,v) \\;:=\\; N(u - v) \\qquad (u, v \\in V),$$ where $u - v = u + (-v)$ ([[def-vector-space]]). **Then $d_N$ is a metric on $V$** ([[def-metric-space]]), and the three axioms are the three conditions above, in order: - **(M1)** $d_N(u,v) = 0$ means $N(u-v) = 0$, which by (N1) says $u - v = 0_V$, that is $u = v$; and conversely $d_N(v,v) = N(0_V) = 0$. - **(M2)** $d_N(v,u) = N(v-u) = N\\bigl((-1)(u-v)\\bigr) = |-1|\\,N(u-v) = d_N(u,v)$, by (N2), [[lem-of-abs-value]] and $(-1)w = -w$ ([[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]]). - **(M3)** $d_N(u,w) = N\\bigl((u-v) + (v-w)\\bigr) \\le N(u-v) + N(v-w) = d_N(u,v) + d_N(v,w)$, by (N3). A normed space is therefore a metric space, and every notion defined for metric spaces — open set ([[def-metric-topology]]), convergence, Cauchyness, continuity, compactness — is available in it with no further definition. **This library never introduces a second notion of any of them for normed spaces.** ### Two properties an arbitrary metric need not have The metric $d_N$ satisfies, for all $u, v, w \\in V$ and $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$: - **translation invariance**, $d_N(u + w, v + w) = N\\bigl((u+w)-(v+w)\\bigr) = N(u-v) = d_N(u,v)$; - **absolute homogeneity**, $d_N(\\lambda u, \\lambda v) = N\\bigl(\\lambda(u-v)\\bigr) = |\\lambda|\\,d_N(u,v)$, by (N2). **Not every metric on a vector space arises from a norm**, and homogeneity is what fails. The published bounded remetrisation [[lem-bounded-remetrisation]] replaces a metric $d$ by $d' = \\min\\{d, 1\\}$, a metric with the same topology whose values never exceed $1$; on a vector space $V$ containing a vector $v$ with $d(v, 0_V) > 0$ this $d'$ cannot be $d_M$ for any norm $M$, since absolute homogeneity would force $d'(\\lambda v, 0_V) = |\\lambda|\\,d'(v, 0_V)$, which is unbounded in $\\lambda$, while $d'$ is bounded by $1$. So the passage from norms to metrics is not reversible, and a statement about a metric on a vector space is strictly weaker than the corresponding statement about a norm.",

Note that this is defined for **every** $a$, including $a = 0$. **Negative exponents.** If $a \\ne 0$ and $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ with $n \\ge 1$, set $$a^{-n} := (a^n)^{-1}.$$ **Why that is legitimate.** The right-hand side presupposes that $a^n$ is invertible, that is, that $a^n \\ne 0$. This is a proof obligation and not an observation, and it is discharged by claim 2 of [[lem-power-laws]]: for $a \\ne 0$ in a field, $a^n \\ne 0$ for every $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, proved there by induction on $n$ from the fact that a field has no zero divisors ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]).

Given $a^n \\ne 0$, the value $(a^n)^{-1}$ is a single well-determined element, because multiplicative inverses in a field are unique ([[lem-of-inverse-unique]]). **Integer exponents.** Every integer $m$ ([[def-integers]]) is either $\\iota(n)$ or $-\\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$, where $\\iota$ is the embedding $\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]], [[def-int-operations]]). This too is a citation and not a slogan: the order on $\\mathbb{Z}$ is total ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), so $m \\ge 0$ or $m < 0$; the image of $\\iota$ is exactly the set of nonnegative integers, and each of them is $\\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]); and if $m < 0$ then $-m > 0$, by compatibility of the order with addition ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), so $-m = \\iota(n)$ and $m = -\\iota(n)$, with $n$ unique because $\\iota$ is injective. The two clauses above therefore define $a^m$ for every $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ whenever $a \\ne 0$, and for every $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$ for arbitrary $a$. The clauses are consistent where they overlap: the only overlap is $m = 0$, where $-\\iota(0) = \\iota(0)$ and $(a^0)^{-1} = 1^{-1} = 1 = a^0$.",

The same construction with starting element $(0, 1)$ and $f(n, p) = (\\sigma(n),\\, p \\cdot a_n)$, with the same induction on the first coordinate and the same uniqueness argument, gives the unique $\\Pi : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ with $$\\Pi_0 = 1, \\qquad \\Pi_{\\sigma(n)} = \\Pi_n \\cdot a_n ,$$ and we write $\\prod_{k < n} a_k := \\Pi_n$. **Notation.** For $m, n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ we abbreviate $$\\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \\sum_{k < n+1} a_k, \\qquad \\prod_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \\prod_{k < n+1} a_k,$$ and, for a general lower index $m$ with $m \\le n + 1$, writing $d = n + 1 - m$ for the number of terms, $$\\sum_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \\sum_{j < d} a_{m+j}, \\qquad \\prod_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \\prod_{j < d} a_{m+j} .$$ When $m = n + 1$ we have $d = 0$ and the sum is **empty**, with value $0$, while the empty product has value $1$. In the same spirit $\\sum_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ is notation for the empty sum $\\Sigma_0 = 0$ and $\\prod_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ for the empty product $\\Pi_0 = 1$; the index $-1$ never occurs as an element of $\\mathbb{N}$ and is only a way of writing \"no terms\". Only finitely many values of $a$ enter $\\sum_{k<n} a_k$, so the notation $\\sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\\prod_{k<n} a_k$ is also used for a list $a_0, \\dots, a_{n-1}$ of reals given without reference to any extension of the list to all of $\\mathbb{N}$: extend the list by $a_k = 0$ (respectively $a_k = 1$) for $k \\ge n$ and apply the definition above.",

## Definition

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]) with additive identity $0_F$ and
multiplicative identity $1_F$. Define
$\iota : \mathbb{N} \to F$ by recursion on $\mathbb{N}$
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[thm-recursion]]):

$$\iota(0) \;:=\; 0_F, \qquad \iota(n+1) \;:=\; \iota(n) + 1_F .$$

$\iota(n)$ is the **canonical natural** of $n$ in $F$. It is also written
$n \cdot 1_F$, and for $n \ge 1$ it is $1_F$ added to itself $n$ times.

**Why the notation is needed at all.** A natural number in this library is a von
Neumann natural, that is a set ([[def-natural-numbers]]), and a set is not an
element of $F$. So $1/n$, $n^{\alpha}$ and $x/n$ are not expressions of $F$ when
$n$ is a natural: what they mean is $1/\iota(n)$, $\iota(n)^{\alpha}$ and
$x/\iota(n)$. The map $\iota$ is what carries a counting number into the field,
and writing it is the whole reason a reader meets $1/\iota(k+1)$ where an
informal text would write $1/(k+1)$.

## Remarks

- **Where the index shift comes from.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
  ([[def-natural-numbers]]) and $\iota(0) = 0_F$, so $1/\iota(k)$ is undefined at
  $k = 0$. A family of reciprocals indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ is therefore written
  over $\iota(k+1)$, which is why the harmonic and telescoping families of this
  library run over $k+1$ rather than over $k$. This is bookkeeping, not a
  restriction: the values are the usual ones.

- **This definition records notation; the arithmetic is proved elsewhere.** That
  $\iota$ is strictly increasing and positive on $n \ge 1$, and that it carries
  sums to sums and products to products, is [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], stated
  for an ordered field. That lemma introduces the same element by the equivalent
  recursion $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, which
  agrees with the definition above because $\iota(1) = \iota(0) + 1_F = 1_F$.
  Nothing here is new mathematics; the definition exists so that the notation has
  a home a reader can look up.

- **The symbol $\iota$ is used in this library for other canonical maps, and this
  definition does not govern them.** It also denotes the canonical field
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to F$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), the isometric
  embedding of a metric space into a completion ([[def-metric-completion]]), and
  an inclusion map $\iota : S \to X$ of a subspace. Each of those is introduced
  where it is used and means something different from the map defined here. What
  the four share is only that each is the canonical map of its situation.

- **Fields, not just ordered fields.** The recursion needs no order, so the
  definition is stated for a field; every use in this library is in an ordered
  field, and the order is what makes $\iota$ injective
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). In a field of positive characteristic $\iota$
  is not injective, which is one reason the injectivity is a lemma rather than
  part of the definition.

## Definition

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. A natural number is a von Neumann natural, that is a set,
and $n = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]],
[[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]), so

$$\mathbb{R}^{n} \;=\; \{\, x \;:\; x \text{ is a function } n \to \mathbb{R} \,\}$$

is the function space of [[def-function-space]] at $F = \mathbb{R}$ and $X = n$,
a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ under the pointwise operations
([[def-vector-space]]). We write $x_k := x(k)$ for $k < n$, and two elements of
$\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are equal exactly when they agree at every $k < n$. This is the
same set that [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] calls $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.

The **Euclidean inner product** of $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the real number

$$\langle x, y\rangle \;:=\; \sum_{k<n} x_k\,y_k ,$$

the finite sum of [[def-finite-sum]] applied to the list $k \mapsto x_k y_k$
(extended by $0$ beyond $n$, as every finite list in this library is). The
**Euclidean norm** of $x$ is

$$\lVert x\rVert_2 \;:=\; \sqrt{\langle x, x\rangle},$$

which is defined because $\langle x,x\rangle = \sum_{k<n} x_k^{2} \ge 0$ (a sum
of nonnegative terms, [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 4 and
[[lem-of-square-positive]], the case $x_k = 0$ giving $x_k^2 = 0$ by
[[def-integer-power]]) and every nonnegative real has a unique nonnegative square
root ([[thm-of-square-roots]]).

### Both are defined for every $n$, including $n = 0$

At $n = 0$ the set $\mathbb{R}^{0}$ has exactly one element, the empty function,
and it is the zero vector space ([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]] clause 5); the sum
above is the empty sum, so $\langle x,y\rangle = 0$ and $\lVert x\rVert_2 = 0$.
**This is the first place on this page where the two index regimes diverge, and
the divergence is deliberate.** The published metrics $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_\infty$ of
[[lem-metrics-on-rn]] are defined only for $n \ge 1$, because $d_\infty$ would
otherwise be a maximum over the empty index set; the algebra above needs no such
restriction. The boundary in this page runs between the algebra and the metric,
not where a reader would guess, and [[rem-rn-conventions-and-scope]] lists
exactly which items inherit $n \ge 1$.

### The algebra of the inner product

For all $x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$:

1. **Symmetry.** $\langle x,y\rangle = \langle y,x\rangle$, since $x_ky_k = y_kx_k$
   termwise.
2. **Additivity in the first argument.**
   $\langle x + y, z\rangle = \langle x,z\rangle + \langle y,z\rangle$: the list
   $k \mapsto (x_k+y_k)z_k$ is the termwise sum of $k \mapsto x_kz_k$ and
   $k \mapsto y_kz_k$, so [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 1 applies.
3. **Homogeneity in the first argument.**
   $\langle \lambda x, y\rangle = \lambda\langle x,y\rangle$, by
   [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 2.
4. **Bilinearity.** Clauses 2 and 3 together with symmetry give the same two laws
   in the second argument.
5. **Positive definiteness.** $\langle x,x\rangle \ge 0$, and
   $\langle x,x\rangle = 0$ if and only if $x = 0$. Indeed a vanishing sum of
   nonnegative terms has every term $0$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 4), so
   $x_k^{2} = 0$ for every $k < n$, and a nonzero real has a positive square
   ([[lem-of-square-positive]]), whence $x_k = 0$ for every $k < n$ and $x = 0$.
6. **Agreement with the published Euclidean metric.** For $n \ge 1$ and
   $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$,
   $\lVert x - y\rVert_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}(x_k-y_k)^{2}} = d_2(x,y)$, the two
   sides being the same expression ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]]). In particular
   $\lVert x\rVert_2 = d_2(x, 0)$.

That $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ is a norm in the sense of [[def-norm-and-normed-space]]
is proved in [[thm-cauchy-schwarz-and-the-euclidean-norm]], where the triangle
inequality is obtained from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality; it is not assumed
here.

## Remarks

- **Scope: the concrete form only.** What is defined above is the Euclidean inner
  product on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and nothing more. The general theory of inner
  product spaces — abstract inner products, orthonormal bases, Gram-Schmidt,
  orthogonal projection and orthogonal complements of arbitrary subspaces — is
  planned for a page of this library that comes **earlier in the plan order** and
  is not yet built. No item on this page claims anything about abstract inner
  product spaces, and no item on this page introduces the general notion.

- **The standard basis and coordinates.** For $i < n$ the standard unit vector
  $e_i \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ has $e_i(i) = 1$ and $e_i(j) = 0$ for $j \ne i$
  ([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]]). Then $\langle x, e_i\rangle = x_i$: the list
  $k \mapsto x_k (e_i)_k$ vanishes except at $k = i$, where its value is $x_i$,
  and a list vanishing off one index sums to its value there
  ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 3, splitting the range at $i$). So the
  coordinates of $x$ are recovered by testing against the standard basis, which
  is the form used repeatedly below.

- **Powers here are integer powers.** $x_k^{2}$ means the integer power of
  [[def-integer-power]], and $\lVert x\rVert_2^{2} = \langle x,x\rangle$ by
  [[thm-of-square-roots]] and [[lem-power-laws]].

## Definition

Throughout this page $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), in particular an ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]]) and a field ([[def-field]]), and $\mathbb{N}$ is the set
of natural numbers ([[def-natural-numbers]]) with successor $\sigma(n) = n + 1$
([[def-nat-addition]]).

Let $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a sequence of reals, written $a_k$ for
$a(k)$. **Finite sums and finite products of $a$ are defined by recursion on the
upper index**, which is legitimate because of the recursion theorem
([[thm-recursion]]). That theorem produces a function of one variable, so the
running index has to be carried along inside the value: applying it to the set
$A = \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$, the starting element $(0, 0)$ and the function
$f(n, s) = (\sigma(n),\, s + a_n)$ gives a unique
$g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$ with

$$g(0) = (0, 0), \qquad g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n)) \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Write $g(n) = \big(\pi_1(g(n)),\, \Sigma_n\big)$ for its two coordinates.

**The first coordinate is the index itself, and that is a small induction, not an
observation** ([[thm-induction-principle]]). Indeed $\pi_1(g(0)) = 0$; and if
$\pi_1(g(n)) = n$, then
$g(\sigma(n)) = f\big(\pi_1(g(n)), \Sigma_n\big) = \big(\sigma(\pi_1(g(n))),\, \Sigma_n + a_{\pi_1(g(n))}\big) = \big(\sigma(n),\, \Sigma_n + a_n\big)$,
so $\pi_1(g(\sigma(n))) = \sigma(n)$. By induction $\pi_1(g(n)) = n$ for every
$n \in \mathbb{N}$. Only now may the second coordinate of the two displayed
clauses be read off, and doing so gives

$$\Sigma_0 = 0, \qquad \Sigma_{\sigma(n)} = \Sigma_n + a_n .$$

$\Sigma$ is moreover the **unique** function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with those
two properties: if $\Sigma'$ also has them then $n \mapsto (n, \Sigma'_n)$ satisfies
the two clauses defining $g$, hence equals $g$ by the uniqueness clause of
[[thm-recursion]], so $\Sigma' = \Sigma$.

We write $\sum_{k < n} a_k := \Sigma_n$. The same construction with starting
element $(0, 1)$ and $f(n, p) = (\sigma(n),\, p \cdot a_n)$, with the same
induction on the first coordinate and the same uniqueness argument, gives the
unique $\Pi : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with

$$\Pi_0 = 1, \qquad \Pi_{\sigma(n)} = \Pi_n \cdot a_n ,$$

and we write $\prod_{k < n} a_k := \Pi_n$.

**Notation.** For $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ we abbreviate

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \sum_{k < n+1} a_k, \qquad \prod_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \prod_{k < n+1} a_k,$$

and, for a general lower index $m$ with $m \le n + 1$, writing $d = n + 1 - m$
for the number of terms,

$$\sum_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \sum_{j < d} a_{m+j}, \qquad \prod_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \prod_{j < d} a_{m+j} .$$

When $m = n + 1$ we have $d = 0$ and the sum is **empty**, with value $0$, while
the empty product has value $1$. In the same spirit $\sum_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ is
notation for the empty sum $\Sigma_0 = 0$ and $\prod_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ for the
empty product $\Pi_0 = 1$; the index $-1$ never occurs as an element of
$\mathbb{N}$ and is only a way of writing "no terms".

Only finitely many values of $a$ enter $\sum_{k<n} a_k$, so the notation
$\sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\prod_{k<n} a_k$ is also used for a list
$a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$ of reals given without reference to any extension of the
list to all of $\mathbb{N}$: extend the list by $a_k = 0$ (respectively
$a_k = 1$) for $k \ge n$ and apply the definition above.

## Remarks

- **Why recursion and not "$a_0 + a_1 + \cdots + a_{n-1}$".** The dots are not a
  definition: they presuppose that the displayed pattern determines a value for
  every $n$, which is exactly what the recursion theorem
  ([[thm-recursion]]) supplies, and its uniqueness clause is what makes
  $\sum_{k<n} a_k$ a single well-determined real rather than a family of choices.
  Associativity and commutativity of addition are *not* used in the definition;
  they are used in the laws proved from it ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).
- **Naturals and rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$ (a convention used on the whole
  page).** A natural number $n$ and a rational number $r$ are not literally
  elements of $\mathbb{R}$: they enter $\mathbb{R}$ through the canonical
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$, which is an injective,
  order-preserving field homomorphism ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), restricting on
  positive naturals to $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} = 1_\mathbb{R} + \cdots + 1_\mathbb{R}$
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). Following ordinary practice, and only where no
  confusion is possible, we write $n$ for $\iota(n)$ and $r$ for $\iota(r)$; so,
  for instance, $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k<n} a_k$ means
  $\iota(n)^{-1} \cdot \sum_{k<n} a_k$, which makes sense because
  $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$. Exponents are the one place where the
  identification is deliberately NOT made: in $a^n$ and $a^r$ the exponent stays
  a natural, an integer or a rational ([[def-integer-power]],
  [[def-rational-power]]), never a real.
- The two indexings are related by $\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k = \sum_{k < n+1} a_k$, so
  a statement proved for one is available for the other. Sums over $k < n$ are
  the primitive form here because $\Sigma_0$, the empty sum, is then the base
  case of every induction, and no index outside $\mathbb{N}$ is ever needed.

## Definition

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets and let $f : A \to B$ be a function ([[def-function]]).

- $f$ is **injective** (one-to-one) if $f(x) = f(y)$ implies $x = y$, for all
  $x, y \in A$.
- $f$ is **surjective** (onto) if for every $b \in B$ there is some $x \in A$
  with $f(x) = b$; equivalently, the image $f[A] := \{ f(x) : x \in A \}$ equals
  $B$.
- $f$ is **bijective** if it is both injective and surjective.

For $S \subseteq A$ we write $f[S] = \{ f(x) : x \in S \}$ for the image of $S$,
and for $T \subseteq B$ we write $f^{-1}[T] = \{ x \in A : f(x) \in T \}$ for the
preimage of $T$; these are the image and preimage of a set under $f$ read as a
relation ([[def-image-and-preimage-under-a-relation]]).

## Remarks

- **Composition.** If $f : A \to B$ and $g : B \to C$ are both injective then so
  is $g \circ f$, since $g(f(x)) = g(f(y))$ forces $f(x) = f(y)$ and then
  $x = y$; if both are surjective then so is $g \circ f$, since any $c \in C$ is
  $g(b)$ for some $b \in B$ and that $b$ is $f(a)$ for some $a \in A$. Hence a
  composition of bijections is a bijection. These verifications, together with the
  two partial converses, are
  [[prop-composition-preserves-injectivity-surjectivity-and-bijectivity]].

- **Inverses.** $f : A \to B$ is bijective exactly when there is a function
  $f^{-1} : B \to A$ with $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ for all $x \in A$ and
  $f(f^{-1}(b)) = b$ for all $b \in B$; that two-sided inverse is unique, and it
  is itself a bijection. Injectivity alone gives a bijection from $A$ onto the
  image $f[A]$, and hence an inverse defined on $f[A]$ only. No choice principle
  is involved: the value $f^{-1}(b)$ is the *unique* $x$ with $f(x) = b$, so it
  is determined rather than selected. The full statement, with the uniqueness of the

## Definition

Let $a \in \mathbb{R}$, where $\mathbb{R}$ is the ambient ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]).

**Natural exponents.** By the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) applied to
the set $\mathbb{R}$, the starting element $1$ and the function
$f(x) = x \cdot a$, there is a unique function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$,
written $n \mapsto a^n$, with

$$a^0 = 1, \qquad a^{n+1} = a^n \cdot a \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Thus $a^1 = a$, $a^2 = a \cdot a$, and so on. Note that this is defined for
**every** $a$, including $a = 0$.

**Negative exponents.** If $a \ne 0$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, set

$$a^{-n} := (a^n)^{-1}.$$

**Why that is legitimate.** The right-hand side presupposes that $a^n$ is
invertible, that is, that $a^n \ne 0$. This is a proof obligation and not an
observation, and it is discharged by claim 2 of [[lem-power-laws]]: for $a \ne 0$
in a field, $a^n \ne 0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, proved there by induction on
$n$ from the fact that a field has no zero divisors ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]).
That lemma is a statement *about* the operation introduced here, so it depends on
this definition and is recorded in this item's `justified_by` rather than in its
`deps` (SCHEMA §3). Given $a^n \ne 0$, the value $(a^n)^{-1}$ is a single
well-determined element, because multiplicative inverses in a field are unique
([[lem-of-inverse-unique]]).

**Integer exponents.** Every integer $m$ ([[def-integers]]) is either
$\iota(n)$ or $-\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$, where $\iota$ is the
embedding $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]],
[[def-int-operations]]). This too is a citation and not a slogan: the order on
$\mathbb{Z}$ is total ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), so $m \ge 0$ or $m < 0$; the
image of $\iota$ is exactly the set of nonnegative integers, and each of them is
$\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]); and if $m < 0$ then
$-m > 0$, by compatibility of the order with addition ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]),
so $-m = \iota(n)$ and $m = -\iota(n)$, with $n$ unique because $\iota$ is
injective. The two clauses above therefore define $a^m$ for every
$m \in \mathbb{Z}$ whenever $a \ne 0$, and for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$ for
arbitrary $a$. The clauses are consistent where they overlap: the only overlap is
$m = 0$, where $-\iota(0) = \iota(0)$ and $(a^0)^{-1} = 1^{-1} = 1 = a^0$.

## Remarks

- **The convention $0^0 = 1$ is adopted here**, and it is not a matter of taste
  but of agreement with the recursion above: $a^0 = 1$ is the starting value for
  every $a$, exactly as the empty product is $1$ ([[def-finite-sum]]). This is
  the convention that makes the empty product, the binomial theorem, and
  polynomial notation $\sum_k c_k x^k$ work at $x = 0$ without an exception. The
  competing convention "$0^0$ undefined" belongs to contexts where $x^y$ is
  studied as a function of two *real* variables and one wants continuity, which
  is unavailable and irrelevant here: the exponent in $a^m$ is an integer, never
  a real.
- $0^n = 0$ for every $n \ge 1$, since $0^{n} = 0^{n-1} \cdot 0 = 0$, a product
  with a zero factor ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]); and
  $0^{-n}$ is not defined for $n \ge 1$, since $0$ has no inverse.
- The exponent is an integer and stays an integer. Rational exponents are a
  separate construction resting on the existence of roots
  ([[thm-nth-roots-exist]], [[def-rational-power]]), and real exponents do not
  exist in this library yet ([[rem-real-exponents-deferred]]).
- The laws $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$ are
  proved, not assumed, in [[lem-power-laws]]; the order behaviour of $a \mapsto a^n$
  is [[lem-power-monotone]].

## Definition

Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $F$ ([[def-vector-space]]).

### Finite sums of vectors

By axiom (V1) the triple $(V, +, 0_V)$ is an abelian group ([[def-group]]), hence
in particular a commutative monoid ([[def-semigroup-and-monoid]]). So the finite
products of [[def-monoid-finite-product]] are available in it, and we write them
**additively**: for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and a finite list $u : n \to V$, that is a
function on the von Neumann natural $n = \{0, \dots, n-1\}$
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]),

$$\sum_{i<n} u_i \;:=\; \prod_{i<n} u_i \quad \text{computed in } (V,+,0_V),$$

so that $\sum_{i<0} u_i = 0_V$ and $\sum_{i<\sigma(n)} u_i = \bigl(\sum_{i<n} u_i\bigr) + u_n$,
and the value depends only on $u_0, \dots, u_{n-1}$.

### Linear combinations

A **linear combination in $V$** is a vector of the form

$$\sum_{i<n} \lambda_i v_i$$

where $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $\lambda : n \to F$ is a finite list of scalars and
$v : n \to V$ is a finite list of vectors; the sum is the finite sum just
described, of the list $i \mapsto \lambda_i v_i$. For $S \subseteq V$, a vector
$w \in V$ is a **linear combination of elements of $S$** when there are
$n \in \mathbb{N}$, $\lambda : n \to F$ and $v : n \to S$ with
$w = \sum_{i<n} \lambda_i v_i$.

**The empty case is a real case.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
([[def-natural-numbers]]), and at $n = 0$ the sum is the empty sum, which is
$0_V$. So $0_V$ is a linear combination of elements of every subset of $V$,
including $S = \varnothing$. The lists are indexed from $0$, so a linear
combination of length $n$ is $\lambda_0 v_0 + \dots + \lambda_{n-1}v_{n-1}$; no
statement here is restricted to $n \ge 1$.

### The span

Let $S \subseteq V$. The set of linear subspaces of $V$ containing $S$ is
nonempty, since $V$ itself is one, so its intersection is a linear subspace of
$V$ by [[lem-intersection-of-linear-subspaces]]. That intersection is the **span
of $S$**,

$$\operatorname{span}(S) \;:=\; \bigcap \{\, W \;:\; W \text{ is a linear subspace of } V \text{ and } S \subseteq W \,\} .$$

It contains $S$, being an intersection of sets each of which contains $S$, and it
is contained in every linear subspace of $V$ that contains $S$. So it is the
**smallest** linear subspace of $V$ containing $S$, and those two properties
determine it uniquely: if $W$ and $W'$ both contain $S$ and are each contained in
every linear subspace containing $S$, then each is contained in the other. This
is what licenses the definite article.

A subset $S \subseteq V$ **spans** $V$, or is a **spanning set** of $V$, when
$\operatorname{span}(S) = V$.

## Remarks

- **The definition is the one already used for subgroups.**
  [[def-generated-subgroup]] defines $\langle S \rangle$ as the intersection of
  all subgroups containing $S$, licensed by
  [[lem-intersection-of-subgroups]]. Its Remarks also record a description from
  inside, as a set of products, proved there only for a single generator
  ([[lem-cyclic-subgroup-is-the-set-of-powers]]) with the general case deferred
  to a later page. The span is defined here in exactly that outside shape, and
  the identification from inside, that $\operatorname{span}(S)$ is precisely the
  set of linear combinations of elements of $S$, is proved in full as
  [[lem-span-is-the-set-of-linear-combinations]]. In particular
  $\operatorname{span}(\varnothing) = \{0_V\}$ is proved there, as a consequence
  of the definition, and is not stipulated here.

- **Why the finite sum is [[def-monoid-finite-product]] and not
  [[def-finite-sum]].** The latter is stated for sequences into the complete
  ordered field, so it cannot carry a sum of vectors in an arbitrary vector space
  over an arbitrary field. The monoid finite product is defined by recursion in
  any monoid, its empty value is the identity, and
  [[thm-generalised-associativity]] supplies the splitting, regrouping and
  reordering laws for it. Reading it additively in $(V,+,0_V)$ costs nothing and
  is the only sum of vectors this page uses.

- **A linear combination is a value, not an expression.** Two different lists may
  produce the same vector, and nothing above asserts otherwise. Repetitions are
  allowed in the list $v$, and so are coefficients equal to $0_F$; asking when a
  vector is a linear combination of a set in only one way is the question of
  linear independence, which belongs to a later page and is not raised here.

## Definition

Throughout this page $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) constructed in this library, in particular a
field, so that "vector space" below always means vector space over $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-vector-space]]).

Let $V$ be a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$, with zero vector $0_V$. A **norm on
$V$** is a function $N : V \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $u, v \in V$ and all
$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$:

- **(N1) Separation.** $N(v) = 0$ if and only if $v = 0_V$.
- **(N2) Absolute homogeneity.** $N(\lambda v) = |\lambda|\,N(v)$, the absolute
  value being that of [[def-abs-value]].
- **(N3) Triangle inequality.** $N(u + v) \le N(u) + N(v)$.

A **normed space** is a pair $(V, N)$ consisting of a vector space $V$ over
$\mathbb{R}$ and a norm $N$ on it. When only one norm is in play we write
$\lVert v\rVert$ for $N(v)$; when several are, the norm is always named.

**The values of a norm are real numbers.** The codomain is $\mathbb{R}$, so
$N(v)$ is an honest element of the complete ordered field and no infinite value
is permitted. This is the same convention [[rem-metric-axiom-conventions]]
records for metrics.

### Nonnegativity is a theorem, not an axiom

Many texts add a fourth condition $N(v) \ge 0$. It is redundant. Applying (N2)
with $\lambda = -1$ gives $N(-v) = |-1|\,N(v) = N(v)$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]],
[[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]] for $(-1)v = -v$), and then (N3)
with $u = v$ and $-v$ gives

$$0 \;=\; N(0_V) \;=\; N\bigl(v + (-v)\bigr) \;\le\; N(v) + N(-v) \;=\; N(v) + N(v),$$

where $N(0_V) = 0$ is (N1). So $N(v) + N(v) \ge 0$, and if $N(v) < 0$ then
$N(v) + N(v) < 0$ by addition of inequalities, which trichotomy forbids
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]). Hence $N(v) \ge 0$ for every $v \in V$.

**Consequently the verification of a candidate norm has three things to check and
not four**, exactly as the verification of a candidate metric has three and not
four ([[def-metric-space]], [[lem-metric-nonnegativity]]). No item in this
library assumes nonnegativity of a norm before the argument above.

### The induced metric

Let $N$ be a norm on $V$ and define

$$d_N(u,v) \;:=\; N(u - v) \qquad (u, v \in V),$$

where $u - v = u + (-v)$ ([[def-vector-space]]). **Then $d_N$ is a metric on
$V$** ([[def-metric-space]]), and the three axioms are the three conditions
above, in order:

- **(M1)** $d_N(u,v) = 0$ means $N(u-v) = 0$, which by (N1) says $u - v = 0_V$,
  that is $u = v$; and conversely $d_N(v,v) = N(0_V) = 0$.
- **(M2)** $d_N(v,u) = N(v-u) = N\bigl((-1)(u-v)\bigr) = |-1|\,N(u-v) = d_N(u,v)$,
  by (N2), [[lem-of-abs-value]] and $(-1)w = -w$
  ([[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]]).
- **(M3)** $d_N(u,w) = N\bigl((u-v) + (v-w)\bigr) \le N(u-v) + N(v-w) = d_N(u,v) + d_N(v,w)$,
  by (N3).

A normed space is therefore a metric space, and every notion defined for metric
spaces — open set ([[def-metric-topology]]), convergence, Cauchyness,
continuity, compactness — is available in it with no further definition. **This
library never introduces a second notion of any of them for normed spaces.**

### Two properties an arbitrary metric need not have

The metric $d_N$ satisfies, for all $u, v, w \in V$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$:

- **translation invariance**, $d_N(u + w, v + w) = N\bigl((u+w)-(v+w)\bigr) = N(u-v) = d_N(u,v)$;
- **absolute homogeneity**, $d_N(\lambda u, \lambda v) = N\bigl(\lambda(u-v)\bigr) = |\lambda|\,d_N(u,v)$, by (N2).

**Not every metric on a vector space arises from a norm**, and homogeneity is
what fails. The published bounded remetrisation [[lem-bounded-remetrisation]]
replaces a metric $d$ by $d' = \min\{d, 1\}$, a metric with the same topology
whose values never exceed $1$; on a vector space $V$ containing a vector $v$ with
$d(v, 0_V) > 0$ this $d'$ cannot be $d_M$ for any norm $M$, since absolute
homogeneity would force $d'(\lambda v, 0_V) = |\lambda|\,d'(v, 0_V)$, which is
unbounded in $\lambda$, while $d'$ is bounded by $1$. So the passage from norms
to metrics is not reversible, and a statement about a metric on a vector space is
strictly weaker than the corresponding statement about a norm.

## Remarks

- **Why (N1) is stated as an equivalence.** The direction $N(0_V) = 0$ is forced
  by (N2) with $\lambda = 0$, since $0\,v = 0_V$
  ([[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]]) gives $N(0_V) = |0|\,N(v) = 0$.
  Only the direction "$N(v) = 0$ implies $v = 0_V$" is a genuine assumption, and
  dropping it gives what is usually called a seminorm, a notion this library does
  not use. The situation is exactly the one [[rem-metric-axiom-conventions]]
  describes for (M1) and the pseudometric.

- **The zero space carries exactly one norm.** If $V = \{0_V\}$ then the only
  function $V \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying (N1) is the one with value $0$, and it
  satisfies (N2) and (N3) trivially. In particular $\mathbb{R}^{0}$, the function
  space on the empty index set ([[def-function-space]]), is a normed space,
  although the metrics of the published metric theory on $\mathbb{R}^n$ are
  defined only for $n \ge 1$.

- **What is not defined here.** This item does not define linear maps; their
  published definition is [[def-linear-map]]. It also does not define operator
  norms, dual spaces, or abstract inner product spaces.
  [[rem-rn-conventions-and-scope]] records the remaining scope boundaries and
  what each later development would license.

## Definition

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be the function space of
[[def-euclidean-inner-product]], with $x_k := x(k)$ for $k < n$.

### The $p$-norm, for a rational exponent $p \ge 1$

Let $p \in \mathbb{Q}$ with $p \ge 1$. For $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ put

$$\lVert x\rVert_p \;:=\; \Bigl(\sum_{k<n} |x_k|^{p}\Bigr)^{1/p},$$

where $|\cdot|$ is the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]), the sum is the finite
sum of [[def-finite-sum]], and both powers are the **rational** powers of
[[def-rational-power]].

**Every power written here is defined.** Each base $|x_k|$ is a nonnegative real
and $p > 0$, so $|x_k|^{p}$ is given by [[def-rational-power]] for $|x_k| > 0$
and by its supplementary clause $0^{p} = 0$ for $|x_k| = 0$; the sum of these
nonnegative terms is nonnegative ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 4), and
$1/p$ is a positive rational, so the outer power is defined for the same two
reasons. The value does not depend on which representative of $p$ or of $1/p$ is
used ([[lem-rational-power-well-defined]]).

**The exponent is a rational, and that is not a matter of taste.**
[[def-rational-power]] supplies $a^{r}$ for a nonnegative base and a **rational**
exponent only; real exponents do not exist at this point in the reading order,
and [[rem-real-exponents-deferred]] records exactly why. This is also why the
published Minkowski inequality [[thm-minkowski-finite]], which is what makes the
triangle inequality work below, is itself stated for rational $p \ge 1$. **No
statement on this page is written for $p$ ranging over a real interval.**

### The maximum norm

For $n \ge 1$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ put

$$\lVert x\rVert_\infty \;:=\; \max\{\, |x_k| \;:\; k < n \,\},$$

the maximum of a nonempty finite set of reals, which exists and is one of its
elements ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

**The hypothesis $n \ge 1$ is required and propagates.** At $n = 0$ the set
$\{|x_k| : k<n\}$ is empty and has no maximum ([[def-max-min]]). This is the same
restriction the published [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] carries, for the same reason, and
**every statement on this page that mentions $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ inherits
it**. The $p$-norms for rational $p \ge 1$ carry no such restriction: at $n = 0$
each is the empty sum raised to a positive rational power, hence $0$.

### The three cases the rest of the page uses

- $\lVert x\rVert_1 = \sum_{k<n}|x_k|$, since $t^{1} = t$ for $t \ge 0$
  ([[lem-rational-power-laws]], and $0^{1} = 0$ by the supplementary clause).
- $\lVert x\rVert_2 = \bigl(\sum_{k<n}|x_k|^{2}\bigr)^{1/2} = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}x_k^{2}}$,
  which is exactly the Euclidean norm of [[def-euclidean-inner-product]]: the
  exponent $2$ agrees with the integer power, so $|x_k|^{2} = x_k^{2}$
  ([[lem-of-abs-value]]), and $t^{1/2}$ is the unique nonnegative square root of
  $t$, which is $\sqrt{t}$ ([[def-rational-power]], [[thm-of-square-roots]]).
  **The two notations denote the same function and no second Euclidean norm is
  introduced.**
- $\lVert x\rVert_\infty$ as above, for $n \ge 1$.

That each of these is a norm in the sense of [[def-norm-and-normed-space]], and
that the metrics they induce are exactly the published $d_1$, $d_2$ and
$d_\infty$ of [[lem-metrics-on-rn]], is
[[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]]; it is proved there
and is not assumed here.

## Remarks

- **Why $p \ge 1$.** The triangle inequality for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$ is
  Minkowski's inequality, and [[thm-minkowski-finite]] is stated for rational
  $p \ge 1$. For $0 < p < 1$ the displayed expression is still defined but is not
  a norm on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n \ge 2$; nothing on this page asserts anything
  about that range, and the expression is never written with such an exponent.

- **Monotonicity in the base is what makes the comparisons below work.** For a
  fixed positive rational $r$ the map $a \mapsto a^{r}$ is strictly increasing on
  the positive reals ([[lem-rational-power-monotone]] clause 2), so an inequality
  between nonnegative sums passes through the outer power. That is the only
  property of rational powers used in the comparison chain of
  [[lem-every-norm-on-rn-is-continuous-for-the-euclidean-metric]].

- **The subscript $\infty$ is a name, not a number.** No arithmetic is performed
  with it, and $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ is not $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$ for any
  exponent; it is a separately defined function that happens to sit at the end of
  the family. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$ silently that
  [[def-interval]] records for the interval notation.

## Statement

Let $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be sequences of reals, let
$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, and let $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, with finite sums and
finite products as in [[def-finite-sum]]. Then:

1. **Additivity.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k$.
2. **Scaling.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k$; in particular $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda = n\lambda$, where $n$ denotes the canonical natural $\iota(n) \in \mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).
3. **Splitting.** If $m \le n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k$, and $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n} a_k = \Big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k\Big)$.
4. **Monotonicity.** If $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$. In particular, if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, every single term satisfies $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$ for $j < n$, and $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ forces $a_k = 0$ for every $k < n$.
5. **Telescoping.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}\big(c_{k+1} - c_k\big) = c_n - c_0$.
6. **Products.** $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k) = \Big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\Big)$; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, and if $a_k > 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k > 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\lambda$, and naturals $m, n$. Write $\Sigma_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\Pi_n = \prod_{k<n} a_k$.

[L1] Recursion clauses ([[def-finite-sum]]): $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ and $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n$; $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1$ and $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) \cdot a_n$; and $\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k = \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j}$ for $m \le n$, likewise for products.

[L2] Field axioms: addition and multiplication are associative and commutative, $0$ and $1$ are the identities, $x - x = 0$, and multiplication distributes over addition ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]); and $0 \cdot x = 0$, which is not an axiom but a lemma ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

[L3] Induction principle: a property holding at $0$ and inherited by successors holds at every natural ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L4] Adding inequalities: $x \le y$ and $u \le v$ imply $x + u \le y + v$. [[lem-of-add-order]] states the STRICT forms and only those ($x < y \Rightarrow x + c < y + c$, and $x < y$ with $u < v$ giving $x + u < y + v$); the nonstrict form used throughout below is those two together with the cases $x = y$ and $u = v$, which are settled by trichotomy, the order being total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] The canonical embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a field homomorphism, so $\iota(0) = 0$ and $\iota(n+1) = \iota(n) + 1$, and $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L6] Sign rules: a product of two positives is positive ([[lem-of-sign-rules]], claim 1), and a product of two nonnegatives is nonnegative, since a factor equal to $0$ makes the product $0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]) and otherwise both factors are positive; and $1 > 0$, which is proved in [[cor-of-one-positive]] and stated by none of the items named above.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 0$: every claim holds at $n = 0$, since both sides of claim 1 are $0 = 0 + 0$, both sides of claim 2 are $0 = \lambda \cdot 0$ and $0 = \iota(0)\lambda$, claim 4 reads $0 \le 0$ with no term to bound and the hypothesis $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ giving nothing to prove, claim 5 reads $0 = c_0 - c_0$, and claim 6 reads $1 = 1 \cdot 1$ with $1 > 0$. [base, L1, L2, L5, L6]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for this $n$ and for all sequences $a, b, c$ and all $\lambda$. [ih]

1.3 Splitting, claim 3, by a separate induction on the number of trailing terms $d = n - m$ with $m$ fixed: for $d = 0$ the claim reads $\sum_{k<m} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + 0$ and $\prod_{k<m} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\big) \cdot 1$, which hold; and if $\sum_{k<m+d} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d} a_{m+j}$, then $\sum_{k<m+d+1} a_k = \sum_{k<m+d} a_k + a_{m+d} = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \big(\sum_{j<d} a_{m+j} + a_{m+d}\big) = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d+1} a_{m+j}$ by associativity, and identically for products with $1$ in place of $0$ and multiplication in place of addition, so induction on $d$ gives claim 3 for every $m \le n$. [L1, L2, L3]

2.1 Additivity at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k\big) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) + \big(\sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n\big) = \sum_{k<n+1} a_k + \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$, using the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of addition. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Scaling at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda a_k = \sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda\big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) = \lambda \sum_{k<n+1} a_k$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and distributivity; taking $a_k = 1$ for all $k$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda = \sum_{k<n} \lambda + \lambda = \iota(n)\lambda + \lambda = (\iota(n) + 1)\lambda = \iota(n+1)\lambda$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L5]

2.3 Monotonicity at $n+1$: assume $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n+1$; then $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$, so the hypothesis gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$, and adding the inequality $a_n \le b_n$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n \le \sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n = \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$. [step 1.2, L1, L4]

2.4 Telescoping at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(c_{k+1} - c_k) = \sum_{k<n}(c_{k+1} - c_k) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = (c_n - c_0) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = c_{n+1} - c_0$, by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and the field identities. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.5 Products at $n+1$: $\prod_{k<n+1}(a_k b_k) = \big(\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k)\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n+1} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n+1} b_k\big)$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of multiplication; and if every $a_k \ge 0$ for $k < n+1$ then $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) a_n$ is a product of two nonnegatives, hence nonnegative, with the same argument giving positivity from positivity since $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1 > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L6]

3.1 Consequences of monotonicity, completing claim 4: monotonicity itself holds at every $n$, by the induction principle applied to the base case of step 1.1 and the successor step 2.3, so it is available for an arbitrary $n$ in what follows; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then comparing with the zero sequence gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge \sum_{k<n} 0 = 0$; for $j < n$ splitting at $j$ and then at $j+1$ writes $\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<j} a_k + a_j + \sum_{k=j+1}^{n-1} a_k$ with the first and third summands $\ge 0$, so $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$; and if moreover $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ then $0 \le a_j \le 0$ for every $j < n$, so $a_j = 0$. [step 1.1, step 2.3, step 1.3, L3, L4, L2]

4.1 By the induction principle claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and claim 3 was proved in step 1.3 with its consequences in step 3.1, so all six laws hold. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, step 2.5, step 1.3, step 3.1, L3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b \in F$.

1. If $a > 0$ then $a^{-1} > 0$.
2. If $0 < a < b$ then $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b \in F$.

[L1] $x > 0 \iff x \in P$; $x < 0 \iff -x \in P$; and for $x \neq 0$ exactly one of $x \in P$, $-x \in P$ holds ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Sign rules: a product of a positive and a negative is negative, a product of two positives is positive, and for $c > 0$ one has $a < b \iff ac < bc$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

[L3] $0 < 1$; in particular $1 \neq 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L4] $P$ is closed under addition, so $<$ is transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a > 0$, so $a \neq 0$ and its inverse $a^{-1}$ exists with $a \cdot a^{-1} = 1$; moreover $a^{-1} \neq 0$, since $a^{-1}$ has $a$ as its inverse while $0$ is non-invertible ($1 \neq 0$ by L3). [assume-hyp, L1, L3]

2.1 By trichotomy $a^{-1} \in P$ or $-a^{-1} \in P$; if $-a^{-1} \in P$, then $a > 0$ and $a^{-1} < 0$ give $a \cdot a^{-1} < 0$ by the sign rules, i.e. $1 < 0$, contradicting $0 < 1$; hence $a^{-1} \in P$, i.e. $a^{-1} > 0$, proving claim 1. [step 1.1, L2, L3, L1]

3.1 Assume $0 < a < b$; then $0 < b$ by transitivity, so by claim 1 both $a^{-1} > 0$ and $b^{-1} > 0$, and the sign rules give $a^{-1} b^{-1} > 0$. [assume-hyp, step 2.1, L4, L2, L1]

4.1 Multiplying $a < b$ by the positive $a^{-1} b^{-1}$ via the sign rules gives $a (a^{-1} b^{-1}) < b (a^{-1} b^{-1})$; since $a a^{-1} = 1$ and $b b^{-1} = 1$, this simplifies to $b^{-1} < a^{-1}$. [step 3.1, L2, algebra]

5.1 Together with $b^{-1} > 0$ from step 3.1, we conclude $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$, proving claim 2. [step 3.1, step 4.1] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field, with field structure as in [[def-field]], and for
$n \ge 1$ let $n \cdot 1_F$ denote the canonical natural number
$\underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$, defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$
and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$. Then for every $n \ge 1$:

- $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$;
- the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$;
- $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ and $(mn) \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F)$ for all $m, n \ge 1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ whose canonical naturals are defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, with $0 \cdot 1_F = 0$.

[L1] $0 < 1_F$ in every ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] The order is compatible with addition and positives are closed under addition: $a < b$ implies $a + c < b + c$, and $a > 0$, $b > 0$ imply $a + b > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 1$: by definition $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, and $1_F > 0$. [L1, base]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: assume $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for some fixed $n \ge 1$. [ih]

1.3 By the recursion, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F - n \cdot 1_F = 1_F > 0$, so $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$. [given, L1]

1.4 Additive identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ by the recursion, and if $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ then $(m+n+1) \cdot 1_F = (m+n) \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + (n+1) \cdot 1_F$. [given, algebra]

2.1 Inductive step: $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ is a sum of two positives, by the hypothesis and $1_F > 0$, hence $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Iterating 1.3, for $m < n$ one has $m \cdot 1_F < n \cdot 1_F$, so $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing and therefore injective on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$. [step 1.3, L2]

2.3 Multiplicative identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m \cdot 1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(1 \cdot 1_F)$, and the step $(m(n+1)) \cdot 1_F = (mn + m) \cdot 1_F = (mn) \cdot 1_F + m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F) + (m \cdot 1_F)(1_F) = (m \cdot 1_F)((n+1) \cdot 1_F)$ uses 1.4 and distributivity. [step 1.4, algebra]

3.1 By induction on 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for every $n \ge 1$; with the strict increase 2.2 and the identities 1.4, 2.3, every claim holds. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 1.4, step 2.3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field. For $a, b \ge 0$:

$$a < b \iff a^2 < b^2, \qquad a \le b \iff a^2 \le b^2.$$

More generally, for arbitrary $a, b \in F$, $a^2 < b^2 \iff |a| < |b|$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Elements $a, b$ of an ordered field $F$.

[L1] For a positive factor $s > 0$ and any $t$: $t > 0 \iff st > 0$; this is [[lem-of-sign-rules]] (the rule $c > 0 \Rightarrow (x < y \iff xc < yc)$ taken at $x = 0$, $y = t$, $c = s$, using $0 \cdot s = 0$, [[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

[L2] Trichotomy: for $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $a > b$ holds; and a sum of two nonnegatives with at least one positive is positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] $|x| \ge 0$ and $|x|^2 = x^2$ for every $x$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The difference factors as $b^2 - a^2 = (b - a)(b + a)$. [algebra]

2.1 If $a, b \ge 0$ and $a < b$, then $b > 0$, so $b + a > 0$ by [L2], and $b - a > 0$; by [L1] with $s = b + a$ and $t = b - a$, $(b - a)(b + a) > 0$, i.e. $a^2 < b^2$. [L1, L2, step 1.1]

2.2 If $a, b \ge 0$ and $a^2 < b^2$, then $b^2 - a^2 > 0$, so $a, b$ are not both zero and $b + a > 0$ by [L2]; by [L1] with $s = b + a$, from $(b - a)(b + a) = b^2 - a^2 > 0$ we get $b - a > 0$, i.e. $a < b$. [L1, L2, step 1.1]

3.1 Hence for $a, b \ge 0$, $a < b \iff a^2 < b^2$. [step 2.1, step 2.2]

4.1 The $\le$ form follows by trichotomy: for $a, b \ge 0$, applying step 3.1 to the nonnegatives $b, a$ gives $a \le b \iff \lnot(b < a) \iff \lnot(b^2 < a^2) \iff a^2 \le b^2$. [step 3.1, L2]

5.1 For arbitrary $a, b$, [L3] gives $|a|, |b| \ge 0$ with $|a|^2 = a^2$ and $|b|^2 = b^2$; applying step 3.1 to $|a|, |b|$ yields $a^2 < b^2 \iff |a|^2 < |b|^2 \iff |a| < |b|$. [step 3.1, L3] ∎

## Statement

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $p \in \mathbb{Q}$ with $p \ge 1$, with the norms
of [[def-p-norms-on-rn]]. Then:

1. $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$ is a norm on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
   ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]).
2. For $n \ge 1$, $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ is a norm on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
3. **The dictionary.** For $n \ge 1$ and all $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$,
   $$\lVert x-y\rVert_1 = d_1(x,y), \qquad \lVert x-y\rVert_2 = d_2(x,y), \qquad \lVert x-y\rVert_\infty = d_\infty(x,y),$$
   where $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_\infty$ are the metrics of the published
   [[lem-metrics-on-rn]]. So the metric induced by each of these three norms
   ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]) **is** the correspondingly named published
   metric, not merely one equivalent to it.

**Consequence, used repeatedly below and stated once here.** By clause 3 at
$p = 2$, the metric space $(\mathbb{R}^{n}, d_2)$ of the published metric-spaces
page and the metric space underlying the normed space
$(\mathbb{R}^{n}, \lVert\cdot\rVert_2)$ of this page are the same object. Hence
completeness ([[thm-euclidean-space-complete]] clause 2), Heine-Borel
([[thm-heine-borel-rn]] clause 2) and the compactness equivalences
([[thm-metric-compactness-equivalences]]) are statements about this page's normed
space, **with their hypothesis $n \ge 1$ inherited unchanged and not weakened**.
Nothing below cites any of those three theorems for $n = 0$.

**Why this lemma exists.** Without it the library would hold a norm-induced
metric on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and a separately published metric on the same set with
no recorded relation, and every later citation would have to guess which was
meant. The proof of clause 3 is a comparison of two written expressions; the
value is that the comparison is made and recorded.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural number $n$, a rational $p \ge 1$, vectors $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ and a real $\lambda$; write $S(x) := \sum_{k<n}|x_k|^{p}$, so that $\lVert x\rVert_p = S(x)^{1/p}$ ([[def-p-norms-on-rn]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[A1] For clauses 2 and 3, $n \ge 1$, so that $\{|x_k| : k<n\}$ is a nonempty finite set of reals ([[def-p-norms-on-rn]], [[lem-metrics-on-rn]]).

[L1] Rational powers ([[def-rational-power]], [[lem-rational-power-laws]]): for $a, b \ge 0$ and rationals $r, s > 0$ one has $a^{r} \ge 0$, $(ab)^{r} = a^{r}b^{r}$, $0^{r} = 0$, and $a^{r} > 0$ when $a > 0$; and for $a > 0$, $(a^{r})^{s} = a^{rs}$ and $a^{1} = a$.

[L2] Monotonicity in the base ([[lem-rational-power-monotone]] clause 2): for a rational $r > 0$ and reals $0 \le a < b$ one has $a^{r} < b^{r}$; hence $a \le b$ implies $a^{r} \le b^{r}$, the case $a = b$ being trivial, and $a^{r} = 0$ only for $a = 0$.

[L3] Laws of finite sums ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[def-finite-sum]]): additivity, scaling, monotonicity; a sum of nonnegative terms is nonnegative, each single term is at most such a sum, and a sum of nonnegative terms that vanishes has every term $0$.

[L4] Minkowski's inequality for finite sums at rational $p \ge 1$ ([[thm-minkowski-finite]]): $\bigl(\sum_{k<n}|a_k+b_k|^{p}\bigr)^{1/p} \le \bigl(\sum_{k<n}|a_k|^{p}\bigr)^{1/p} + \bigl(\sum_{k<n}|b_k|^{p}\bigr)^{1/p}$.

[L5] Absolute value ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]], [[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]): $|t| \ge 0$; $|t| = 0$ exactly when $t = 0$; $|st| = |s|\,|t|$; $|s+t| \le |s|+|t|$; and $|t|^{2} = t^{2}$.

[L6] Maxima ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]): a nonempty finite set of reals has a maximum, the maximum belongs to the set and bounds it above, and a set with an upper bound belonging to it has that element as its maximum.

[L7] Order arithmetic: multiplying an inequality by a nonnegative real preserves it ([[lem-of-sign-rules]] in its strict form, together with the case of equality settled by totality), and $\le$ is transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L8] The norm axioms (N1), (N2), (N3) ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]); $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ agrees with the Euclidean norm of [[def-euclidean-inner-product]], and is a norm by [[thm-cauchy-schwarz-and-the-euclidean-norm]]; square roots are the rational power at exponent $1/2$ ([[thm-of-square-roots]], [[def-p-norms-on-rn]]).

[L9] The published metrics on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n \ge 1$ are $d_1(x,y) = \sum_{k<n}|x_k-y_k|$, $d_2(x,y) = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}(x_k-y_k)^{2}}$ and $d_\infty(x,y) = \max\{|x_k-y_k| : k<n\}$, and each is a metric ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]], [[def-metric-space]], [[def-metric-topology]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Every term $|x_k|^{p}$ is nonnegative, so $S(x) \ge 0$ and $\lVert x\rVert_p = S(x)^{1/p}$ is defined and nonnegative. [L1, L3]

1.2 $S(x) = 0$ holds exactly when $|x_k|^{p} = 0$ for every $k<n$, a vanishing sum of nonnegative terms having every term $0$; and $|x_k|^{p} = 0$ exactly when $|x_k| = 0$, that is exactly when $x_k = 0$. [L1, L2, L3, L5]

1.3 For every $k<n$, $|(\lambda x)_k|^{p} = \bigl(|\lambda|\,|x_k|\bigr)^{p} = |\lambda|^{p}|x_k|^{p}$, so $S(\lambda x) = |\lambda|^{p}S(x)$ by scaling of finite sums. [L1, L3, L5]

1.4 Instantiating [L4] at $a_k := x_k$ and $b_k := y_k$, and using $(x+y)_k = x_k+y_k$, gives $\lVert x+y\rVert_p \le \lVert x\rVert_p + \lVert y\rVert_p$, which is axiom (N3) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$. [L4, L8]

1.5 Under [A1] the set $\{|x_k| : k<n\}$ is nonempty and finite, so $\lVert x\rVert_\infty$ exists, is one of the $|x_k|$, and satisfies $|x_k| \le \lVert x\rVert_\infty$ for every $k<n$; in particular $\lVert x\rVert_\infty \ge 0$. [A1, L5, L6]

1.6 Under [A1], $\lVert x-y\rVert_1 = \sum_{k<n}|x_k-y_k|$ by the case $p=1$ of the definition, and that is the written expression for $d_1(x,y)$. [L1, L9]

1.7 Under [A1], $\lVert x-y\rVert_2 = \bigl(\sum_{k<n}|x_k-y_k|^{2}\bigr)^{1/2} = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}(x_k-y_k)^{2}}$, using $|t|^{2} = t^{2}$ and the identification of the exponent $1/2$ with the nonnegative square root, and that is the written expression for $d_2(x,y)$. [L5, L8, L9]

1.8 Under [A1], $\lVert x-y\rVert_\infty = \max\{|x_k-y_k| : k<n\}$ by definition, and that is the written expression for $d_\infty(x,y)$. [L9]

2.1 $\lVert x\rVert_p = 0$ holds exactly when $S(x) = 0$, since $S(x) > 0$ would give $S(x)^{1/p} > 0$ and $0^{1/p} = 0$. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.2 Under [A1]: $\lVert x\rVert_\infty = 0$ forces $|x_k| \le 0$ and $|x_k| \ge 0$ for every $k<n$, hence $x = 0$; and $\lVert 0\rVert_\infty = 0$. This is (N1) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$. [step 1.5, L5, L8]

2.3 Under [A1]: for every $k<n$, $|(\lambda x)_k| = |\lambda|\,|x_k| \le |\lambda|\,\lVert x\rVert_\infty$, and choosing $j<n$ with $|x_j| = \lVert x\rVert_\infty$ gives $|(\lambda x)_j| = |\lambda|\,\lVert x\rVert_\infty$; so $|\lambda|\lVert x\rVert_\infty$ belongs to the set and bounds it above, whence $\lVert \lambda x\rVert_\infty = |\lambda|\lVert x\rVert_\infty$. This is (N2) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$. [step 1.5, L5, L6, L7]

2.4 Under [A1]: for every $k<n$, $|(x+y)_k| = |x_k+y_k| \le |x_k| + |y_k| \le \lVert x\rVert_\infty + \lVert y\rVert_\infty$; choosing $j<n$ with $|(x+y)_j| = \lVert x+y\rVert_\infty$ gives $\lVert x+y\rVert_\infty \le \lVert x\rVert_\infty + \lVert y\rVert_\infty$, which is (N3) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$. [step 1.5, L5, L6, L7]

3.1 By steps 2.1 and 1.2, $\lVert x\rVert_p = 0$ exactly when $x_k = 0$ for every $k<n$, that is exactly when $x = 0$; this is axiom (N1) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$. [step 2.1, step 1.2, L8]

3.2 Steps 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 are (N1), (N2) and (N3) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ under [A1], so clause 2 holds. [step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, A1, L8]

4.1 If $\lambda = 0$ then $\lambda x = 0$ and both sides of (N2) are $0$ by step 3.1; if $\lambda \ne 0$ then $|\lambda| > 0$, and step 1.3 with the power laws gives $\lVert \lambda x\rVert_p = \bigl(|\lambda|^{p}S(x)\bigr)^{1/p} = \bigl(|\lambda|^{p}\bigr)^{1/p}S(x)^{1/p} = |\lambda|^{p\cdot(1/p)}\lVert x\rVert_p = |\lambda|\,\lVert x\rVert_p$; this is axiom (N2). [step 1.3, step 3.1, L1, L5, L8]

5.1 Steps 3.1, 4.1 and 1.4 are (N1), (N2) and (N3) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$, so clause 1 holds. [step 1.4, step 3.1, step 4.1, L8]

6.1 Steps 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8 give clause 3, and with steps 5.1 and 3.2 all three clauses are proved; in particular the metric induced by $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n \ge 1$ is the published $d_2$, which is the consequence recorded in the Statement. [step 5.1, step 3.2, step 1.6, step 1.7, step 1.8, L9] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the consequence does and does not license.** Because the two metric spaces are literally the same, a published theorem about $(\mathbb{R}^{n}, d_2)$ may be quoted here verbatim. It may **not** be quoted with a weaker hypothesis: [[thm-euclidean-space-complete]], [[thm-heine-borel-rn]] and [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] are all stated for $n \ge 1$ only, because $d_\infty$ is a maximum over an empty index set at $n = 0$, and every item on this page that uses one of them carries $n \ge 1$ in its own statement.

- **Clause 1 holds at $n = 0$ and clause 2 does not apply there.** At $n = 0$ every $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$ is the zero function on the one-element space $\mathbb{R}^{0}$, which is the unique norm on the zero space ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]); $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ is not defined there at all.

- **The route to (N3) differs between the two families, and that is not an accident.** For $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$ the triangle inequality is Minkowski's inequality, a genuine theorem about rational powers; for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ it is the elementary argument of step 2.4, that a maximum of sums is at most the sum of the maxima. The second argument is the one that needs a nonempty index set.

## Statement

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]), let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $F^{n}$ be the
function space on the von Neumann natural $n = \{0, \dots, n-1\}$, with the
pointwise operations ([[def-function-space]], [[def-natural-numbers]],
[[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]). For $i < n$ define the **standard unit vector**
$e_i \in F^{n}$ by

$$e_i(i) = 1_F, \qquad e_i(j) = 0_F \ \text{ for } j < n \text{ with } j \ne i .$$

Then:

1. **Finite sums in a function space are pointwise.** For every set $X$, every
   $p \in \mathbb{N}$, every list $u : p \to F^{X}$ and every $j \in X$,
   $$\Bigl(\sum_{k<p} u_k\Bigr)(j) \;=\; \sum_{k<p} u_k(j),$$
   the right-hand sum being taken in $(F,+,0_F)$. (Stated here for an arbitrary
   $X$ because the companion page needs it at $X = \mathbb{N}$.)
2. $e : n \to F^{n}$ is an ordered basis of $F^{n}$ ([[def-linear-basis]]); in
   particular $e$ is injective and its image $e[n] = \{\, e_i : i < n \,\}$ is a
   basis of $F^{n}$ with $e[n] \approx n$ ([[def-equinumerous]]);
3. for every $\lambda : n \to F$ and every $j < n$,
   $\bigl(\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i e_i\bigr)(j) = \lambda_j$; equivalently the
   coordinate list of $x \in F^{n}$ with respect to the ordered basis $e$
   ([[thm-unique-coordinates-with-respect-to-an-ordered-basis]]) is
   $i \mapsto x(i)$;
4. $F^{n}$ is finite-dimensional over $F$ with $\dim_F F^{n} = n$
   ([[def-dimension]]);
5. at $n = 0$ this reads: $F^{0}$ has exactly one element, the empty function,
   so $F^{0}$ is the zero space, the empty list is its ordered basis,
   $\varnothing$ is its basis and $\dim_F F^{0} = 0$.

Every index runs from $0$, so the coordinates of an element of $F^{n}$ are
$x_0, \dots, x_{n-1}$ and no statement above is restricted to $n \ge 1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A field $F$, a natural number $n$, the vector space $F^{n}$ with pointwise operations, and the vectors $e_i$ for $i < n$.

[L1] $F^{X}$ is a vector space over $F$ with $(x+y)(j) = x(j)+y(j)$, $(\lambda x)(j) = \lambda\,x(j)$ and zero the constant function at $0_F$; two elements are equal exactly when they agree at every point; and $F^{0}$ has exactly one element, the empty function, which is $0_{F^{0}}$ ([[def-function-space]], [[def-vector-space]]).

[L2] Finite sums: $\sum_{k<0}u_k$ is the zero vector and $\sum_{k<\sigma(p)}u_k = \bigl(\sum_{k<p}u_k\bigr) + u_p$, in any vector space ([[def-monoid-finite-product]], [[def-linear-combination-and-span]]).

[L3] $F$ is a vector space over itself, with the field addition and multiplication ([[lem-restriction-of-scalars]], claim 1), so the finite sums of $\mathbb{N}$-indexed lists of scalars are available in $(F,+,0_F)$ and satisfy (F1) and (F3); in particular a list of scalars vanishing off a single index sums to its value at that index ([[def-sum-of-linear-subspaces]]).

[L4] In $F$: $\lambda 1_F = \lambda$ and $\lambda 0_F = 0_F$ for every $\lambda \in F$ ([[def-field]], [[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]]).

[L5] A list $v : n \to V$ is an ordered basis of $V$ if and only if every $x \in V$ is $\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i v_i$ for exactly one $\lambda : n \to F$; an ordered basis is injective and its image is a basis with $v[n] \approx n$ ([[thm-unique-coordinates-with-respect-to-an-ordered-basis]], [[def-linear-basis]], [[def-linear-independence]], [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L6] $\dim_F V$ is the unique $p \in \mathbb{N}$ with a basis $B \approx p$, defined when $V$ has a finite basis ([[def-dimension]], [[def-countable]]).

[L7] Induction on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Claim 1, that a finite sum in $F^{X}$ is computed pointwise: for every $p \in \mathbb{N}$, every list $u : p \to F^{X}$ and every $j \in X$, $\bigl(\sum_{k<p}u_k\bigr)(j) = \sum_{k<p}u_k(j)$, the right-hand sum being taken in $(F,+,0_F)$. By induction on $p$: at $p = 0$ the left side is the value at $j$ of the constant function $0_F$ and the right side is the empty sum $0_F$; and if it holds at $p$, then $\bigl(\sum_{k<\sigma(p)}u_k\bigr)(j) = \bigl(\sum_{k<p}u_k + u_p\bigr)(j) = \bigl(\sum_{k<p}u_k\bigr)(j) + u_p(j) = \sum_{k<p}u_k(j) + u_p(j) = \sum_{k<\sigma(p)}u_k(j)$, using pointwise addition and the recursion. [L1, L2, L3, L7]

2.1 Evaluating a combination of the $e_i$. Let $\lambda : n \to F$ and $j < n$. By step 1.1 and pointwise scalar multiplication, $\bigl(\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i e_i\bigr)(j) = \sum_{i<n}(\lambda_i e_i)(j) = \sum_{i<n}\lambda_i\, e_i(j)$. The list of scalars $i \mapsto \lambda_i\,e_i(j)$ takes the value $\lambda_i 0_F = 0_F$ at every $i \ne j$ and the value $\lambda_j 1_F = \lambda_j$ at $i = j$, so it vanishes off the single index $j$ and therefore sums to $\lambda_j$. Hence $\bigl(\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i e_i\bigr)(j) = \lambda_j$ for every $j < n$. [step 1.1, L1, L3, L4]

3.1 Existence and uniqueness of coordinates. Given $x \in F^{n}$, put $\lambda_i := x(i)$; by step 2.1 the vectors $\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i e_i$ and $x$ agree at every $j < n$, hence are equal. And if $\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i e_i = \sum_{i<n}\mu_i e_i$, then evaluating both sides at $j$ and using step 2.1 gives $\lambda_j = \mu_j$ for every $j < n$. So every $x \in F^{n}$ is $\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i e_i$ for exactly one $\lambda : n \to F$. [step 2.1, L1]

4.1 Claims 2 and 3. Step 2.1 is claim 3, and by the coordinate characterisation of an ordered basis, step 3.1 says exactly that $e$ is an ordered basis of $F^{n}$; hence $e$ is injective, $e[n]$ is a basis of $F^{n}$, and $e[n] \approx n$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L5]

5.1 Claims 4 and 5. By step 4.1 the space $F^{n}$ has a basis with $n$ elements, so it is finite-dimensional and $\dim_F F^{n} = n$. At $n = 0$ the space $F^{0}$ has exactly one element, the empty function, which is its zero vector, so $F^{0}$ is the zero space; the list $e$ is then the empty list, its image is $\varnothing$, and $\dim_F F^{0} = 0$. [step 4.1, L1, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- **The indices start at $0$ because a natural number is the set of its predecessors.** $F^{n}$ is the function space $F^{X}$ at $X = n = \{0,\dots,n-1\}$ ([[def-function-space]], [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]), so an element of $F^{n}$ is a function on $\{0,\dots,n-1\}$ and there is no $e_n$. Reading the standard basis off a $1$-indexed source would put a vector outside the space at one end and lose one at the other.

- **Step 1.1 is not a triviality to be skipped.** That a finite sum of functions is the pointwise finite sum is a statement about the recursion defining [[def-monoid-finite-product]] in two different monoids, and it is proved by induction. Every evaluation argument on this page and on the companion page rests on it.

- **This is the concrete counterweight to [[cor-every-vector-space-has-a-basis]].** Here a basis is written down and no choice principle is used anywhere; there a basis is produced by Zorn's lemma and none is exhibited. The companion page carries both extremes for infinite-dimensional spaces as well: an explicit infinite basis for the eventually zero families, and a basis of $\mathbb{R}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ that no argument exhibits.

## Statement

Let $F$ be a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]). Then every
$a \in F$ with $a \ge 0$ has a **unique** $s \in F$ with $s \ge 0$ and $s^2 = a$;
we write $s = \sqrt{a}$. Consequently the positive elements of $F$ are exactly the
nonzero squares: $x > 0$ if and only if $x = y^2$ for some $y \neq 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), that is, an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with the least-upper-bound property, and an element $a \in F$ with $a \ge 0$.

[L1] Every nonempty subset of $F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Sign and scaling rules: a product of positives is positive, and for $c > 0$ one has $x < y \iff cx < cy$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

[L3] Squaring is strictly monotone on the nonnegatives: if $0 \le x < y$ then $x^2 < y^2$; in particular squaring is injective on $\{x : x \ge 0\}$ ([[lem-of-square-monotone]]).

[L4] A nonzero square is positive: if $y \neq 0$ then $y^2 > 0$ ([[lem-of-square-positive]]).

[L5] Multiplying inequalities of positives: if $0 < x < y$ and $0 < u < v$ then $xu < yv$ ([[prop-of-multiply-inequalities]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 If $a = 0$, then $s = 0$ satisfies $s \ge 0$ and $s^2 = 0 = a$, so existence holds; assume henceforth $a > 0$. [given, algebra]

1.2 Uniqueness holds once a root exists: if $u, v \ge 0$ satisfy $u^2 = v^2$, then strict monotonicity of squaring on nonnegatives [L3] rules out both $u < v$ and $u > v$, forcing $u = v$; so at most one $s \ge 0$ has $s^2 = a$. [L3, given]

1.3 Define $S = \{ t \in F : t \ge 0 \text{ and } t^2 \le a \}$; then $0 \in S$ because $0 \ge 0$ and $0^2 = 0 \le a$, so $S \neq \emptyset$. [given, algebra]

1.4 The element $1 + a$ is an upper bound of $S$: since $a > 0$ we have $1 + a > 1$, so any $t > 1 + a$ has $t > 1$ and $t > 0$, whence $t^2 = t \cdot t > 1 \cdot t = t > 1 + a > a$, giving $t \notin S$. [given, L2]

2.1 By completeness [L1], $s := \sup S$ exists in $F$; and since $0 \in S$ we have $s \ge 0$. [L1, step 1.3, step 1.4]

3.1 Assume, for contradiction, that $s^2 \neq a$; by trichotomy either $s^2 < a$ or $s^2 > a$. [assume-contra, step 2.1]

4.1 (Case $s^2 < a$.) Choose $h$ with $0 < h < 1$ and $h < \dfrac{a - s^2}{2s + 1}$, possible since $a - s^2 > 0$ and $2s + 1 \ge 1 > 0$; then $h^2 = h \cdot h < h \cdot 1 = h$ and $h(2s+1) < a - s^2$, so $(s+h)^2 = s^2 + 2sh + h^2 < s^2 + 2sh + h = s^2 + h(2s+1) < a$, whence $s + h \in S$ with $s + h > s$, contradicting that $s$ is an upper bound of $S$. [assume-case low, step 3.1, step 2.1, L2, L5, choose]

4.2 (Case $s^2 > a$.) Here $s > 0$ since $s^2 > a \ge 0$; choose $h$ with $0 < h < s$ and $h < \dfrac{s^2 - a}{2s}$, so $2sh < s^2 - a$ and $(s-h)^2 = s^2 - 2sh + h^2 \ge s^2 - 2sh > a$, hence every $t \in S$ has $t^2 \le a < (s-h)^2$ with $t \ge 0$ and $s - h > 0$, so $t < s - h$ by [L3]; thus $s - h$ is an upper bound of $S$ with $s - h < s$, contradicting that $s$ is the least upper bound. [assume-case high, step 3.1, step 2.1, L3, choose]

5.1 Both cases of the disjunction in step 3.1 give a contradiction, so the assumption fails and $s^2 = a$: a unique (by step 1.2) $s = \sqrt{a} \ge 0$ with $s^2 = a$ exists, and applying this to any $x > 0$ writes $x = (\sqrt{x})^2$ with $\sqrt{x} \neq 0$ while conversely any nonzero square is positive by [L4], so the positive elements of $F$ are exactly the nonzero squares. [step 4.1, step 4.2, step 3.1, step 1.2, L4, cases, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Statement

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, let $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and let
$v : m \to \mathbb{R}^{n}$ be a finite list of vectors with

$$\lVert v_i\rVert_2 \le 1 \ \text{ for every } i<m, \qquad \sum_{i<m} v_i = 0 .$$

Then there is a bijection $\pi : m \to m$
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]) such that

$$\Bigl\lVert \sum_{j<k} v_{\pi(j)} \Bigr\rVert_2 \;\le\; \iota(n) \qquad \text{for every } k \le m,$$

where $\iota$ is the canonical natural of $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-canonical-natural]]) and the sums are the finite sums of the vector space
$\mathbb{R}^{n}$ ([[def-linear-combination-and-span]]).

**The bound depends only on the dimension, not on $m$.** That is the whole
content: the triangle inequality alone gives only $\iota(k)$, which grows with
the number of vectors used.

**Which Steinitz result this is.** This is Steinitz's polygonal confinement
lemma, the rearrangement lemma of his 1913 paper on conditionally convergent
series. It is **not** the Steinitz exchange lemma of linear algebra, which is
published in this library as `thm-steinitz-exchange` and carries the alias
`lem-steinitz`. The two are unrelated results by the same author, and no item on
this page uses the bare alias.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Naturals $n \ge 1$ and $m$; a list $v : m \to \mathbb{R}^{n}$ with $\lVert v_i\rVert_2 \le 1$ for $i<m$ and $\sum_{i<m}v_i = 0$. Every finite list below is extended by $0$ beyond its range, so that the finite sums of [[def-finite-sum]] apply verbatim; a list into $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is summed in the vector space $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ ([[def-linear-combination-and-span]]).

[L1] Norm facts: $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ is a norm on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, $\lVert\lambda u\rVert_2 = |\lambda|\lVert u\rVert_2$, $\lVert u\rVert_2 \ge 0$, and the finite triangle inequality $\lVert\sum_{j<p}u_j\rVert_2 \le \sum_{j<p}\lVert u_j\rVert_2$ ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]], [[def-p-norms-on-rn]], [[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]], [[thm-cauchy-schwarz-and-the-euclidean-norm]], [[lem-every-norm-on-rn-is-continuous-for-the-euclidean-metric]] clause 1).

[L2] Laws of finite sums of reals ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[def-finite-sum]]): additivity, scaling, splitting $\sum_{i<r}b_i = \sum_{i<q}b_i + \sum_{i=q}^{r-1}b_i$ for $q \le r$ with $\sum_{i=q}^{r-1}b_i = \sum_{l<r-q}b_{q+l}$, monotonicity, $\sum_{j<p}\lambda = \iota(p)\lambda$, and the fact that a single term of a sum of nonnegative terms is at most the sum.

[L3] Finite sums in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are computed pointwise: $\bigl(\sum_{j<p}u_j\bigr)(t) = \sum_{j<p}u_j(t)$ for $t<n$ ([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]] clause 1), so every identity between real finite sums yields the corresponding identity between $\mathbb{R}^{n}$-valued ones; and two elements of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are equal exactly when all their coordinates are ([[def-function-space]], [[def-vector-space]], [[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]]).

[L4] The induction principle ([[thm-induction-principle]]) and the well-ordering principle: every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L5] A nonempty finite set of reals has a maximum and a minimum, each an element of the set ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]], [[lem-finite-subsets-listable]]).

[L6] Dimension count: $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ has a basis with $n+1$ elements ([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]] clauses 2 and 4, [[def-dimension]]), so every linearly independent subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is finite with at most $n+1$ elements ([[cor-independent-set-is-no-larger-than-a-finite-spanning-set]], [[def-linear-independence]], [[def-countable]], [[def-equinumerous]], [[lem-pigeonhole]]).

[L7] The canonical natural ([[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]): $\iota(0) = 0$ by the recursion clause, $\iota(p+q) = \iota(p)+\iota(q)$ for $p,q \ge 1$ by claim 3 there and trivially when $p = 0$ or $q = 0$, $\iota$ is strictly increasing, and $\iota(p) > 0$ for $p \ge 1$.

[L8] Order arithmetic: $u>0$ gives $u^{-1}>0$; an inequality may be multiplied by a nonnegative real; and trichotomy ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 **Deleting one entry from a finite sum.** Let $b : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, let $r \ge 1$, let $q<r$, and let $b^{\wedge q}$ be the list with $b^{\wedge q}_i := b_i$ for $i<q$ and $b^{\wedge q}_i := b_{i+1}$ for $q \le i < r-1$. Then $\sum_{i<r}b_i = \sum_{i<r-1}b^{\wedge q}_i + b_q$: splitting the left side at $q$ and again at $q+1$ gives $\sum_{i<q}b_i + b_q + \sum_{l<r-1-q}b_{q+1+l}$, and splitting the right side at $q$ gives $\sum_{i<q}b_i + \sum_{l<r-1-q}b_{q+l+1}$, and the two agree. [L2]

1.2 **The easy case $m \le n$.** Take $\pi$ to be the identity of $m$, a bijection. For $k \le m$ the finite triangle inequality and $\lVert v_j\rVert_2 \le 1$ give $\lVert\sum_{j<k}v_j\rVert_2 \le \sum_{j<k}\lVert v_j\rVert_2 \le \sum_{j<k}1 = \iota(k) \le \iota(n)$, since $k \le m \le n$ and $\iota$ is increasing. So the theorem holds in this case, and we assume $m>n$ from here on. [construct, L1, L2, L7]

1.3 **Stage data.** For $n \le k \le m$ call a pair $(b,\mu)$ **admissible at $k$** when $b : k \to m$ is injective, $\mu : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ vanishes at every $j \ge k$, satisfies $0 \le \mu_j \le 1$ for $j<k$, and satisfies $\sum_{j<k}\mu_j v_{b(j)} = 0$ and $\sum_{j<k}\mu_j = \iota(k-n)$. [construct]

1.4 **Stage $m$ is admissible.** Take $b^{m} :=$ the identity of $m$ and $\mu^{m}_j := \iota(m-n)/\iota(m)$ for $j<m$, $\mu^m_j := 0$ for $j \ge m$; here $\iota(m) > 0$ because $m > n \ge 1$, and $0 \le \iota(m-n) \le \iota(m)$ gives $0 \le \mu^m_j \le 1$. Then $\sum_{j<m}\mu^m_j v_j = \bigl(\iota(m-n)/\iota(m)\bigr)\sum_{j<m}v_j = 0$ and $\sum_{j<m}\mu^m_j = \iota(m)\cdot\iota(m-n)/\iota(m) = \iota(m-n)$. [construct, L2, L7, L8]

1.5 **The estimate for $k<n$, for an arbitrary ordering.** For every bijection $\rho : m \to m$ and every $k<n$, the finite triangle inequality gives $\bigl\lVert\sum_{j<k}v_{\rho(j)}\bigr\rVert_2 \le \sum_{j<k}\lVert v_{\rho(j)}\rVert_2 \le \sum_{j<k}1 = \iota(k) \le \iota(n)$. [L1, L2, L7]

2.1 **The reindexing identity.** For every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, every $r \in \mathbb{N}$, every injective $f : r \to k$ and every $c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ vanishing at every $j<k$ outside the image of $f$, one has $\sum_{j<k}c_j = \sum_{i<r}c_{f(i)}$. This is proved by induction on $k$, with $r$, $f$ and $c$ universally quantified. At $k=0$ the only injective $f : r \to 0$ has $r = 0$ and both sums are empty. At $k+1$, write $\sum_{j<k+1}c_j = \sum_{j<k}c_j + c_k$: if $k$ is not in the image of $f$ then $c_k = 0$ and $f$ maps into $k$, so the inductive hypothesis applies directly; and if $k = f(q)$ for the unique such $q<r$, then $r \ge 1$ and the list $g := f^{\wedge q}$ of step 1.1 is an injective map $r-1 \to k$ off whose image $c$ vanishes on $\{j : j<k\}$, so the inductive hypothesis gives $\sum_{j<k}c_j = \sum_{i<r-1}c_{g(i)}$, while step 1.1 applied to $b_i := c_{f(i)}$ gives $\sum_{i<r}c_{f(i)} = \sum_{i<r-1}c_{g(i)} + c_{f(q)}$; adding $c_k = c_{f(q)}$ to the first identity yields the claim. [step 1.1, L2, L4]

2.2 **The feasible set at $k-1$ is nonempty.** Let $(b,\mu)$ be admissible at $k$ with $n<k\le m$, and let $\Lambda$ be the set of all $\mu' : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ vanishing at every $j\ge k$, with $0 \le \mu'_j \le 1$ for $j<k$, $\sum_{j<k}\mu'_j v_{b(j)} = 0$ and $\sum_{j<k}\mu'_j = \iota(k-1-n)$. The scalar $\rho := \iota(k-1-n)/\iota(k-n)$ is defined and lies in $[0,1]$, since $\iota(k-n)>0$ and $0 \le \iota(k-1-n) \le \iota(k-n)$; and $\rho\mu$ lies in $\Lambda$. [step 1.3, L2, L7, L8]

3.1 Both identities hold verbatim for lists with values in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, since a vector identity is the conjunction of its $n$ coordinate identities and the coordinates of a vector finite sum are the real finite sums of the coordinates. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L3]

3.2 **The minimal number of fractional coordinates.** Call $\mu' \in \Lambda$ **$r$-simple** when there is an injective $f : r \to k$ with $\mu'_j \in \{0,1\}$ for every $j<k$ outside the image of $f$. The set $R := \{\, r \in \mathbb{N} : \text{some } \mu' \in \Lambda \text{ is } r\text{-simple} \,\}$ contains $k$, taking $f$ to be the identity of $k$, so $R$ is a nonempty set of naturals and has a least element $r_0$; fix $\mu \in \Lambda$ and an injective $f : r_0 \to k$ witnessing it. [step 2.2, L4]

4.1 **Two consequences used repeatedly.** Taking $k = r$ and $f$ a bijection of $k$ in step 2.1 gives $\sum_{j<k}c_{f(j)} = \sum_{j<k}c_j$ for every $c$; and taking $c$ to vanish off the image of an injective $f : r \to k$ gives $\sum_{j<k}c_j = \sum_{i<r}c_{f(i)}$, both in $\mathbb{R}$ and in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. [step 2.1, step 3.1]

4.2 **Every marked coordinate is strictly fractional.** For every $i<r_0$ one has $0 < \mu_{f(i)} < 1$: otherwise $\mu_{f(i)} \in \{0,1\}$, and then $f^{\wedge i}$, an injective map $r_0-1 \to k$ off whose image $\mu$ takes values in $\{0,1\}$, would witness that $\mu$ is $(r_0-1)$-simple, contradicting minimality of $r_0$. [step 1.1, step 3.2]

4.3 **Suppose $r_0 \ge n+2$, towards a contradiction.** Define $w : r_0 \to \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ by $w_i(t) := \bigl(v_{b(f(i))}\bigr)(t)$ for $t<n$ and $w_i(n) := 1$. [step 3.2]

5.1 **The list $w$ is linearly dependent:** there is $\lambda : r_0 \to \mathbb{R}$, not identically $0$, with $\sum_{i<r_0}\lambda_i w_i = 0$. If $w$ is not injective, say $w_{i_1} = w_{i_2}$ with $i_1 \ne i_2$, take $\lambda_{i_1} := 1$, $\lambda_{i_2} := -1$ and $\lambda_i := 0$ otherwise; the list $i \mapsto \lambda_i w_i$ then vanishes off $\{i_1,i_2\}$ and sums to $w_{i_1} - w_{i_2} = 0$ by step 4.1. If $w$ is injective, its image is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ equinumerous with $r_0 \ge n+2$, hence not linearly independent by [L6]; so some injective list $h : p \to \operatorname{im}(w)$ is linearly dependent, giving $\nu : p \to \mathbb{R}$ not identically $0$ with $\sum_{l<p}\nu_l h(l) = 0$, and setting $\lambda_{i} := \nu_l$ when $w_i = h(l)$ and $\lambda_i := 0$ otherwise turns that into $\sum_{i<r_0}\lambda_i w_i = 0$ by step 4.1, the list $i \mapsto \lambda_i w_i$ vanishing off the image of the injective map $l \mapsto$ the unique $i$ with $w_i = h(l)$. [step 4.3, L6]

5.2 **The step length.** Let $i_0$ be the least $i<r_0$ with $\lambda_i \ne 0$, which exists because $\lambda$ is not identically $0$. Define $s : r_0 \to \mathbb{R}$ by $s_i := (1-\mu_{f(i)})/\lambda_i$ if $\lambda_i>0$, by $s_i := \mu_{f(i)}/(-\lambda_i)$ if $\lambda_i<0$, and by $s_i := s_{i_0}$ if $\lambda_i = 0$; every $s_i$ is a positive real by step 4.2. Put $t^{*} := \min\{s_0,\dots,s_{r_0-1}\}$, a minimum over a nonempty finite set of reals, so $t^{*}>0$ and $t^{*} = s_{i}$ for some $i<r_0$; choosing that $i$ if $\lambda_i \ne 0$ and $i_0$ otherwise, there is $i^{*}<r_0$ with $\lambda_{i^{*}} \ne 0$ and $t^{*} = s_{i^{*}}$. [step 4.2, L4, L5, L8]

6.1 **Reading the coordinates of step 5.1.** The coordinate $n$ gives $\sum_{i<r_0}\lambda_i = 0$, and the coordinates $t<n$ give $\sum_{i<r_0}\lambda_i v_{b(f(i))} = 0$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. [step 4.3, step 5.1, L3]

6.2 **The moved point.** Define $\mu' : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ by $\mu'_j := \mu_j + t^{*}\lambda_i$ if $j = f(i)$ for the unique $i<r_0$ with that property, and $\mu'_j := \mu_j$ otherwise. Then $0 \le \mu'_j \le 1$ for every $j<k$: outside the image of $f$ nothing changes; at $j = f(i)$ with $\lambda_i>0$ one has $\mu_{f(i)} < \mu'_j \le \mu_{f(i)} + s_i\lambda_i = 1$; with $\lambda_i<0$ one has $0 = \mu_{f(i)} + s_i\lambda_i \le \mu'_j < \mu_{f(i)}$; and with $\lambda_i = 0$ the value is unchanged. [step 4.2, step 5.2, L8]

7.1 **The moved point is feasible.** The list $j \mapsto \mu'_j - \mu_j$ vanishes at every $j<k$ off the image of $f$ and takes the value $t^{*}\lambda_i$ at $f(i)$, so step 4.1 gives $\sum_{j<k}(\mu'_j-\mu_j) = \sum_{i<r_0}t^{*}\lambda_i = t^{*}\cdot 0 = 0$; likewise the $\mathbb{R}^{n}$-valued list $j \mapsto (\mu'_j-\mu_j)v_{b(j)}$ vanishes off that image and takes the value $t^{*}\lambda_i v_{b(f(i))}$ at $f(i)$, so $\sum_{j<k}(\mu'_j-\mu_j)v_{b(j)} = t^{*}\sum_{i<r_0}\lambda_i v_{b(f(i))} = 0$. Hence $\sum_{j<k}\mu'_j = \iota(k-1-n)$ and $\sum_{j<k}\mu'_j v_{b(j)} = 0$, so $\mu' \in \Lambda$. [step 4.1, step 6.1, step 6.2, L2, L3]

8.1 **The contradiction.** By step 5.2, $\mu'_{f(i^{*})} = \mu_{f(i^{*})} + t^{*}\lambda_{i^{*}} \in \{0,1\}$. So $f^{\wedge i^{*}}$, an injective map $r_0-1 \to k$, witnesses that $\mu'$ is $(r_0-1)$-simple: off the image of $f$ the value $\mu'_j = \mu_j$ lies in $\{0,1\}$, and at $f(i^{*})$ it lies in $\{0,1\}$ as just shown. This contradicts the minimality of $r_0$, so the supposition of step 4.3 is untenable and $r_0 \le n+1$. [step 1.1, step 3.2, step 5.2, step 6.2, step 7.1]

9.1 **The support bound.** There is $j_0<k$ with $\mu_{j_0} = 0$. Suppose instead that $\mu_j>0$ for every $j<k$; then off the image of $f$ the value $\mu_j$ lies in $\{0,1\}$ and is positive, hence equals $1$. Put $\nu_j := 1-\mu_j$ for $j<k$ and $\nu_j := 0$ for $j \ge k$, so $\nu$ vanishes at every $j<k$ off the image of $f$ and satisfies $0<\nu_{f(i)}<1$ for $i<r_0$ by step 4.2, while $\sum_{j<k}\nu_j = \iota(k)-\iota(k-1-n) = \iota(n+1)$ by [L7]. [step 4.2, step 8.1, L2, L7]

10.1 By step 4.1, $\sum_{j<k}\nu_j = \sum_{i<r_0}\nu_{f(i)}$. If $r_0 = 0$ this is the empty sum $0$, contradicting $\iota(n+1)>0$. If $r_0 \ge 1$ then every term of $\sum_{i<r_0}(1-\nu_{f(i)})$ is positive, so that sum is at least its term at index $0$ and hence positive, whence $\sum_{i<r_0}\nu_{f(i)} = \iota(r_0) - \sum_{i<r_0}(1-\nu_{f(i)}) < \iota(r_0) \le \iota(n+1)$ using step 8.1. Either way $\iota(n+1) < \iota(n+1)$ or $\iota(n+1) = 0$, both impossible; so some $\mu_{j_0}$ is $0$. [step 4.1, step 8.1, step 9.1, L2, L7, L8]

11.1 **Descending one stage.** With $j_0$ as in step 9.1, put $b' := b^{\wedge j_0} : k-1 \to m$ and $\mu'' := \mu^{\wedge j_0}$, extended by $0$ beyond $k-1$. Then $b'$ is injective with image $\operatorname{im}(b)\setminus\{b(j_0)\}$, $0 \le \mu''_j \le 1$ for $j<k-1$, and by step 1.1 in both its real and its vector form, $\sum_{j<k-1}\mu''_j = \sum_{j<k}\mu_j - \mu_{j_0} = \iota(k-1-n)$ and $\sum_{j<k-1}\mu''_j v_{b'(j)} = \sum_{j<k}\mu_j v_{b(j)} - \mu_{j_0}v_{b(j_0)} = 0$. So $(b',\mu'')$ is admissible at $k-1$. [construct, step 1.1, step 3.1, step 3.2, step 10.1]

12.1 **Iterating.** Starting from the admissible pair of step 1.4 at $k = m$ and applying step 11.1 once for each $k$ from $m$ down to $n+1$, one obtains admissible pairs $(b^{k},\mu^{k})$ for every $k$ with $n \le k \le m$, with $\operatorname{im}(b^{k-1}) \subseteq \operatorname{im}(b^{k})$ and $\operatorname{im}(b^{k})\setminus\operatorname{im}(b^{k-1})$ a single element. This is a recursion of length $m-n$, each stage determined by the previous one together with finitely many determinations (a least natural, a minimum of a finite set of reals), so no choice principle is involved. [construct, step 1.4, step 11.1, L4, L5]

13.1 **The ordering.** Define $\pi : m \to m$ by $\pi(j) := b^{n}(j)$ for $j<n$ and, for each $k$ with $n<k\le m$, $\pi(k-1) := $ the unique element of $\operatorname{im}(b^{k})\setminus\operatorname{im}(b^{k-1})$. The images $\operatorname{im}(b^{k})$ increase from $\operatorname{im}(b^{n})$, of size $n$, to $\operatorname{im}(b^{m}) = m$, gaining exactly one element at each stage, so $\pi$ is injective with image $m$, that is a bijection, and for every $k$ with $n \le k \le m$ the set $\{\pi(j) : j<k\}$ is exactly $\operatorname{im}(b^{k})$. [construct, step 12.1, L4, L6]

14.1 **Both enumerations give the same partial sum.** Fix $k$ with $n \le k \le m$ and let $c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}^{n}$ be $c_i := v_i$ for $i \in \operatorname{im}(b^{k})$ and $c_i := 0$ otherwise. Then $c$ vanishes at every $i<m$ off the image of the injective list $j \mapsto \pi(j)$ on $k$, and also off the image of $b^{k}$, so step 4.1 applied twice gives $\sum_{j<k}v_{\pi(j)} = \sum_{i<m}c_i = \sum_{j<k}v_{b^{k}(j)}$. [step 4.1, step 13.1]

15.1 **The estimate for $n \le k \le m$.** Since $\sum_{j<k}\mu^{k}_j v_{b^{k}(j)} = 0$, additivity gives $\sum_{j<k}v_{b^{k}(j)} = \sum_{j<k}\bigl(1-\mu^{k}_j\bigr)v_{b^{k}(j)}$; each coefficient $1-\mu^{k}_j$ is nonnegative, so the finite triangle inequality and $\lVert v_i\rVert_2 \le 1$ give $\bigl\lVert\sum_{j<k}v_{b^{k}(j)}\bigr\rVert_2 \le \sum_{j<k}\bigl(1-\mu^{k}_j\bigr)\lVert v_{b^{k}(j)}\rVert_2 \le \sum_{j<k}\bigl(1-\mu^{k}_j\bigr) = \iota(k)-\iota(k-n) = \iota(n)$. [step 12.1, step 14.1, L1, L2, L7]

16.1 By steps 14.1 and 15.1 the bound $\lVert\sum_{j<k}v_{\pi(j)}\rVert_2 \le \iota(n)$ holds for $n \le k \le m$, and by step 1.5 it holds for $k<n$; together with the case $m \le n$ of step 1.2, the required bijection $\pi$ has been exhibited in every case. [step 1.2, step 13.1, step 14.1, step 15.1, step 1.5, discharge-construct] ∎

## Remarks

- **The support bound of steps 9.1 and 10.1 is the step most write-ups omit.** From $r_0 \le n+1$ one gets only that the support of $\mu$ has at most $(k-1-n)+(n+1) = k$ elements, which is no information at all. What rules out equality is that the quantities $1-\mu_{f(i)}$ would then be strictly positive at each of at most $n+1$ marked indices while summing to $\iota(n+1)$; that is exactly the computation in steps 9.1 and 10.1, and without a coordinate $\mu_{j_0} = 0$ the descending construction does not start.

- **Where the dimension enters, and only there.** The single place the number $n$ is used is step 5.1, where $n+2$ vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ are linearly dependent. The extra coordinate constantly $1$ is what converts the constraint $\sum_i \lambda_i = 0$ into a linear condition, so that one dependence delivers both identities of step 6.1 at once.

- **No choice principle is used.** The construction is a recursion of length $m-n$; at each stage the objects produced are a least natural number ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]) and a minimum of a nonempty finite set of reals ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]), both determined rather than selected, and the pair $(\mu, f)$ of step 3.2 is a single selection from a nonempty set at each of finitely many stages.

- **The reindexing identity of step 2.1 is proved here rather than cited.** [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] is stated for sums $\sum_{k<n}a_k$ over an initial segment of $\mathbb{N}$ and carries no invariance clause, and no lemma available to this page gives the form step 2.1 needs — an injective $f : r \to k$ with the summand vanishing at every $j < k$ off its image. That form is therefore proved here. Step 2.1 contains permutation invariance as the special case $r = k$ with $f$ a bijection.

- **The constant $\iota(n)$ is not claimed to be optimal.** What is proved is that some ordering keeps every partial sum inside the ball of radius $\iota(n)$; on an explicit list of six unit vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ the companion page exhibits one ordering that meets the bound — with room to spare, so the bound is not attained there — and another that violates it, so the theorem is seen to say something.
