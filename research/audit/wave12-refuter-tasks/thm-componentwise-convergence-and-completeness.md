## Statement

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, let $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ carry the Euclidean
metric $d_2$ of [[lem-metrics-on-rn]], and let $\bigl(x^{(j)}\bigr)_{j\in\mathbb{N}}$
be a sequence in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ ([[def-metric-convergence]]). For $k < n$ write
$\bigl(x^{(j)}_k\bigr)_{j\in\mathbb{N}}$ for the $k$-th **coordinate sequence**,
a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]). Then:

1. **Convergence is componentwise.** For $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$,
   $x^{(j)} \to x$ in $(\mathbb{R}^{n}, d_2)$ if and only if
   $x^{(j)}_k \to x_k$ in $\mathbb{R}$ for every $k<n$
   ([[def-real-limit]]).
2. **Cauchyness is componentwise.** $\bigl(x^{(j)}\bigr)$ is Cauchy in
   $(\mathbb{R}^{n},d_2)$ ([[def-cauchy-in-metric]]) if and only if every
   coordinate sequence is Cauchy in $\mathbb{R}$.
3. **Completeness in every norm.** For every norm $N$ on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
   ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]) the metric space $(\mathbb{R}^{n}, d_N)$ is
   complete ([[def-complete-metric-space]]).

**Clause 3 is obtained by citation and is not reproved here.**
[[thm-euclidean-space-complete]] clause 2 states that $(\mathbb{R}^{n},d_2)$ is
complete, **for $n \ge 1$ only**, and this theorem carries that hypothesis
forward without weakening it; what is added is the passage from $d_2$ to an
arbitrary norm, through [[thm-all-norms-on-rn-are-equivalent]] and the dictionary
of [[def-equivalent-norms]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural $n \ge 1$; the space $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with the norms of [[def-p-norms-on-rn]] and the metric $d_2$; a sequence $\bigl(x^{(j)}\bigr)$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$; a point $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$; a norm $N$ on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$; and a rational $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] The comparison chain for $n \ge 1$ ([[lem-every-norm-on-rn-is-continuous-for-the-euclidean-metric]] clause 3): $\lVert y\rVert_\infty \le \lVert y\rVert_2 \le \lVert y\rVert_1 \le \iota(n)\lVert y\rVert_\infty$ for every $y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$, where $\lVert y\rVert_\infty = \max\{|y_k| : k<n\}$ ([[def-p-norms-on-rn]], [[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L2] The dictionary $d_2(u,v) = \lVert u-v\rVert_2$, and $(u-v)_k = u_k - v_k$ ([[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]], [[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]]).

[L3] Convergence and Cauchyness in a metric space, and their agreement on $\mathbb{R}$ with the real notions ([[def-metric-convergence]], [[def-cauchy-in-metric]], [[def-real-limit]], [[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]); rational and real $\varepsilon$ may be used interchangeably in both.

[L4] $(\mathbb{R}^{n}, d_2)$ is complete for $n \ge 1$ ([[thm-euclidean-space-complete]] clause 2, [[def-complete-metric-space]]).

[L5] All norms on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are equivalent for $n \ge 1$ ([[thm-all-norms-on-rn-are-equivalent]]), and equivalent norms have the same convergent sequences with the same limits and the same Cauchy sequences ([[def-equivalent-norms]]).

[L6] Limits in a metric space are unique, and every convergent sequence is Cauchy ([[lem-metric-limits-unique]], [[lem-metric-convergent-implies-cauchy]]).

[L7] $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$, and $u > 0$ gives $u^{-1} > 0$ ([[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

[L8] A nonempty finite set of naturals has a greatest element, and every nonempty set of naturals has a least element ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]], [[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For every $y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ and every $k<n$: $|y_k| \le \lVert y\rVert_\infty \le \lVert y\rVert_2$, the first inequality because $\lVert y\rVert_\infty$ bounds the set it is the maximum of. [L1]

1.2 For every $y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$: $\lVert y\rVert_2 \le \iota(n)\lVert y\rVert_\infty$, and $\lVert y\rVert_\infty = |y_{k_0}|$ for some $k_0 < n$. [L1]

1.3 Conversely suppose $x^{(j)}_k \to x_k$ for every $k<n$. Given a rational $\varepsilon > 0$, the real $\varepsilon/\iota(n)$ is positive, so for each $k<n$ the set of indices $K$ such that $|x^{(j)}_k - x_k| < \varepsilon/\iota(n)$ for all $j \ge K$ is a nonempty set of naturals; let $K_k$ be its least element, a determination rather than a selection, and put $K := \max\{K_0,\dots,K_{n-1}\}$, a maximum of a nonempty finite set of naturals. [L3, L7, L8]

1.4 $(\mathbb{R}^{n},d_2)$ is complete, by citation and for $n \ge 1$ only. [L4]

1.5 Let $N$ be any norm on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. By [L5], $N$ and $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ are equivalent, so $d_N$ and $d_2$ have the same Cauchy sequences and the same convergent sequences with the same limits. [L5]

2.1 For all $u,v \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $k<n$: $|u_k - v_k| \le d_2(u,v) \le \iota(n)\max\{|u_k-v_k| : k<n\}$, by steps 1.1 and 1.2 applied to $y := u - v$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L2]

2.2 Hence a Cauchy sequence in $(\mathbb{R}^{n},d_N)$ is Cauchy in $(\mathbb{R}^{n},d_2)$, converges there by step 1.4, and therefore converges in $(\mathbb{R}^{n},d_N)$ to the same point; so $(\mathbb{R}^{n},d_N)$ is complete, which is clause 3. [step 1.4, step 1.5, L5, L6]

3.1 Suppose $x^{(j)} \to x$ in $(\mathbb{R}^{n},d_2)$ and fix $k<n$. Given a rational $\varepsilon > 0$, take $K$ with $d_2(x^{(j)},x) < \varepsilon$ for $j \ge K$; then $|x^{(j)}_k - x_k| \le d_2(x^{(j)},x) < \varepsilon$ for $j \ge K$, so $x^{(j)}_k \to x_k$. [step 2.1, L3]

3.2 For $j \ge K$ and every $k<n$ we have $|x^{(j)}_k - x_k| < \varepsilon/\iota(n)$; the maximum of these $n$ numbers is one of them, so $\max\{|x^{(j)}_k - x_k| : k<n\} < \varepsilon/\iota(n)$ and hence $d_2(x^{(j)},x) < \iota(n)\cdot\varepsilon/\iota(n) = \varepsilon$ by step 2.1. Therefore $x^{(j)} \to x$. [step 2.1, step 1.3, L1, L7]

3.3 The same two estimates prove clause 2 with $x$ replaced by $x^{(l)}$ throughout: if $d_2(x^{(j)},x^{(l)}) < \varepsilon$ for $j,l \ge K$ then $|x^{(j)}_k - x^{(l)}_k| < \varepsilon$ for $j,l \ge K$ and every $k<n$; and conversely, choosing for each $k<n$ the least $K_k$ beyond which $|x^{(j)}_k - x^{(l)}_k| < \varepsilon/\iota(n)$ for $j,l \ge K_k$ and taking $K := \max\{K_0,\dots,K_{n-1}\}$ gives $d_2(x^{(j)},x^{(l)}) < \varepsilon$ for $j,l \ge K$. [step 2.1, L3, L7, L8]

4.1 Steps 3.1 and 3.2 are the two directions of clause 1. [step 3.1, step 3.2]

5.1 Clauses 1, 2 and 3 are steps 4.1, 3.3 and 2.2. [step 4.1, step 3.3, step 2.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **No choice principle is used.** The only place a family of indices is produced is steps 1.3 and 3.3, where finitely many indices are obtained, each as the **least** element of a nonempty set of naturals ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]). A least element is determined by the set, not selected from it.

- **What happens at $n = 0$, stated separately because the theorem does not cover it.** $\mathbb{R}^{0}$ has exactly one element, the empty function, and is the zero vector space ([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]] clause 5); by [[def-norm-and-normed-space]] it carries exactly one norm, the zero function, whose induced metric is constantly $0$. Every sequence in a one-point metric space is Cauchy and converges to that point, so $(\mathbb{R}^{0}, d_N)$ is complete. **That statement is proved here from scratch in this remark and is not obtained from [[thm-euclidean-space-complete]]**, which is stated for $n \ge 1$ only because $d_\infty$ is a maximum over an empty index set at $n = 0$. Clauses 1 and 2 are vacuous at $n = 0$, there being no index $k<0$.

- **Clause 1 is the reason the rest of this page can work coordinatewise.** Every later item that reduces a statement about $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ or $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ to $n$ or $m$ statements about $\mathbb{R}$ passes through it, and each such item therefore carries the hypothesis $n \ge 1$ or $m \ge 1$ in its own statement.

For $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ put $$\\lVert x\\rVert_p \\;:=\\; \\Bigl(\\sum_{k<n} |x_k|^{p}\\Bigr)^{1/p},$$ where $|\\cdot|$ is the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]), the sum is the finite sum of [[def-finite-sum]], and both powers are the **rational** powers of [[def-rational-power]]. **Every power written here is defined.** Each base $|x_k|$ is a nonnegative real and $p > 0$, so $|x_k|^{p}$ is given by [[def-rational-power]] for $|x_k| > 0$ and by its supplementary clause $0^{p} = 0$ for $|x_k| = 0$; the sum of these nonnegative terms is nonnegative ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 4), and $1/p$ is a positive rational, so the outer power is defined for the same two reasons. The value does not depend on which representative of $p$ or of $1/p$ is used ([[lem-rational-power-well-defined]]). **The exponent is a rational, and that is not a matter of taste.** [[def-rational-power]] supplies $a^{r}$ for a nonnegative base and a **rational** exponent only; real exponents do not exist at this point in the reading order, and [[rem-real-exponents-deferred]] records exactly why. This is also why the published Minkowski inequality [[thm-minkowski-finite]], which is what makes the triangle inequality work below, is itself stated for rational $p \\ge 1$. **No statement on this page is written for $p$ ranging over a real interval.** ### The maximum norm For $n \\ge 1$ and $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ put $$\\lVert x\\rVert_\\infty \\;:=\\; \\max\\{\\, |x_k| \\;:\\; k < n \\,\\},$$ the maximum of a nonempty finite set of reals, which exists and is one of its elements ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]). **The hypothesis $n \\ge 1$ is required and propagates.** At $n = 0$ the set $\\{|x_k| : k<n\\}$ is empty and has no maximum ([[def-max-min]]). This is the same restriction the published [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] carries, for the same reason, and **every statement on this page that mentions $\\lVert\\cdot\\rVert_\\infty$ inherits it**. The $p$-norms for rational $p \\ge 1$ carry no such restriction: at $n = 0$ each is the empty sum raised to a positive rational power, hence $0$. ### The three cases the rest of the page uses - $\\lVert x\\rVert_1 = \\sum_{k<n}|x_k|$, since $t^{1} = t$ for $t \\ge 0$ ([[lem-rational-power-laws]], and $0^{1} = 0$ by the supplementary clause). - $\\lVert x\\rVert_2 = \\bigl(\\sum_{k<n}|x_k|^{2}\\bigr)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{k<n}x_k^{2}}$, which is exactly the Euclidean norm of [[def-euclidean-inner-product]]: the exponent $2$ agrees with the integer power, so $|x_k|^{2} = x_k^{2}$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]), and $t^{1/2}$ is the unique nonnegative square root of $t$, which is $\\sqrt{t}$ ([[def-rational-power]], [[thm-of-square-roots]]). **The two notations denote the same function and no second Euclidean norm is introduced.** - $\\lVert x\\rVert_\\infty$ as above, for $n \\ge 1$. That each of these is a norm in the sense of [[def-norm-and-normed-space]], and that the metrics they induce are exactly the published $d_1$, $d_2$ and $d_\\infty$ of [[lem-metrics-on-rn]], is [[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]]; it is proved there and is not assumed here.",

The last line deserves its two-line verification, since it is used constantly below and is not literally a clause of [[thm-metric-equivalence-hierarchy]]. If $d_M(v_k, v) \\to 0$ then $0 \\le d_N(v_k,v) \\le C\\,d_M(v_k,v)$, so given a rational $\\varepsilon > 0$ an index beyond which $d_M(v_k,v) < \\varepsilon/C$ serves for $d_N$; the converse uses $d_M \\le c^{-1}d_N$ in the same way. The Cauchy statement is the same estimate applied to $d_N(v_k,v_l)$. In particular $(V, d_M)$ is complete if and only if $(V,d_N)$ is. **Naming.** Many texts say *strongly equivalent* for what [[def-equivalent-metrics]] calls Lipschitz equivalent, and simply *equivalent* for what it calls topologically equivalent. As there, this library always writes the qualifier for metrics.

## Definition

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]) with additive identity $0_F$ and
multiplicative identity $1_F$. Define
$\iota : \mathbb{N} \to F$ by recursion on $\mathbb{N}$
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[thm-recursion]]):

$$\iota(0) \;:=\; 0_F, \qquad \iota(n+1) \;:=\; \iota(n) + 1_F .$$

$\iota(n)$ is the **canonical natural** of $n$ in $F$. It is also written
$n \cdot 1_F$, and for $n \ge 1$ it is $1_F$ added to itself $n$ times.

**Why the notation is needed at all.** A natural number in this library is a von
Neumann natural, that is a set ([[def-natural-numbers]]), and a set is not an
element of $F$. So $1/n$, $n^{\alpha}$ and $x/n$ are not expressions of $F$ when
$n$ is a natural: what they mean is $1/\iota(n)$, $\iota(n)^{\alpha}$ and
$x/\iota(n)$. The map $\iota$ is what carries a counting number into the field,
and writing it is the whole reason a reader meets $1/\iota(k+1)$ where an
informal text would write $1/(k+1)$.

## Remarks

- **Where the index shift comes from.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
  ([[def-natural-numbers]]) and $\iota(0) = 0_F$, so $1/\iota(k)$ is undefined at
  $k = 0$. A family of reciprocals indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ is therefore written
  over $\iota(k+1)$, which is why the harmonic and telescoping families of this
  library run over $k+1$ rather than over $k$. This is bookkeeping, not a
  restriction: the values are the usual ones.

- **This definition records notation; the arithmetic is proved elsewhere.** That
  $\iota$ is strictly increasing and positive on $n \ge 1$, and that it carries
  sums to sums and products to products, is [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], stated
  for an ordered field. That lemma introduces the same element by the equivalent
  recursion $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, which
  agrees with the definition above because $\iota(1) = \iota(0) + 1_F = 1_F$.
  Nothing here is new mathematics; the definition exists so that the notation has
  a home a reader can look up.

- **The symbol $\iota$ is used in this library for other canonical maps, and this
  definition does not govern them.** It also denotes the canonical field
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to F$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), the isometric
  embedding of a metric space into a completion ([[def-metric-completion]]), and
  an inclusion map $\iota : S \to X$ of a subspace. Each of those is introduced
  where it is used and means something different from the map defined here. What
  the four share is only that each is the canonical map of its situation.

- **Fields, not just ordered fields.** The recursion needs no order, so the
  definition is stated for a field; every use in this library is in an ordered
  field, and the order is what makes $\iota$ injective
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). In a field of positive characteristic $\iota$
  is not injective, which is one reason the injectivity is a lemma rather than
  part of the definition.

## Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]) and let $(x_k)$ be a
sequence in $X$, that is a function $\mathbb{N} \to X$ written $x_k := x(k)$
([[def-metric-convergence]], [[def-sequence]]). As everywhere in this library
$\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$, so a sequence is indexed from $0$.

$(x_k)$ is a **Cauchy sequence in $(X,d)$** if for every rational
$\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that

$$d(x_m, x_n) < \varepsilon \qquad \text{for all } m, n \ge K .$$

**Rational and real $\varepsilon$ agree here.** The test is written with a
rational $\varepsilon$ to match [[def-real-limit]] and [[def-metric-convergence]],
and nothing is lost by using a real one: below any real $\eta > 0$ lies a
positive rational ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and the index belonging to that
rational serves for $\eta$. So a proof may establish Cauchyness by producing an
index for every real $\varepsilon > 0$, and may use a Cauchy hypothesis at a real
$\varepsilon$ by first passing to a rational below it. Both moves are used on
this page and are always cited.

**The condition is exactly $d(x_m,x_n) \to 0$ as $m$ and $n$ grow
independently.** The distances $d(x_m,x_n)$ are nonnegative reals
([[lem-metric-nonnegativity]]), and the displayed condition asks them to be
uniformly small on a tail of the doubly indexed family. It is not the same as
$d(x_{k+1}, x_k) \to 0$, which is a strictly weaker condition and is a standing
source of error. The partial sums $H_n$ of the harmonic series separate the two:
consecutive ones differ by $1/(n+1)$, which tends to $0$, while the sequence is
unbounded, and an unbounded sequence of reals is not Cauchy
([[lem-metric-cauchy-bounded]]).

**Consistency with the real line.** For $X = \mathbb{R}$ with the usual metric
$d(x,y) = |x-y|$ ([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]) the condition above reads
$|x_m - x_n| < \varepsilon$ for $m,n \ge K$, which is verbatim the definition of a
Cauchy sequence of reals ([[def-real-limit]]). So the notion introduced here
restricts on $\mathbb{R}$ to the one already in use, and no ambiguity is created.

## Remarks

- **A Cauchy sequence need not converge.** The definition mentions no candidate
  limit, and that is the whole point of it: it is a condition on the sequence
  alone, testable without knowing where the sequence is going. Whether every
  Cauchy sequence converges is a property of the space, namely completeness
  ([[def-complete-metric-space]]), and it genuinely fails in some spaces
  ([[fs-cauchy-implies-convergent-in-every-metric-space]]).
- **Cauchyness is a property of the metric, not of the topology.** Two metrics
  on the same set may have exactly the same open sets and different Cauchy
  sequences ([[fs-equivalent-metrics-share-cauchy-sequences]]). What does
  preserve Cauchy sequences is uniform equivalence
  ([[def-equivalent-metrics]]), and the reason is
  [[thm-uniform-continuity-preserves-cauchy]].
- **Every subsequence of a Cauchy sequence is Cauchy**, since a strictly
  increasing index map satisfies $n_j \ge j$ ([[lem-index-map-grows]]), so the
  same $K$ works for the subsequence. Conversely a Cauchy sequence with one
  convergent subsequence already converges
  ([[lem-metric-cauchy-with-convergent-subsequence]]).

## Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]).

$(X,d)$ is **complete** if every Cauchy sequence in $(X,d)$
([[def-cauchy-in-metric]]) converges to a point of $X$
([[def-metric-convergence]]).

A subset $A \subseteq X$ is called **complete** when the metric subspace
$(A, d_A)$ is complete ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]); as always, the
metric is part of the data, and $d_A$ is the restriction of $d$ to $A \times A$.

**The limit is unique when it exists**, since limits in a metric space are unique
([[lem-metric-limits-unique]]), so a complete space assigns to each of its Cauchy
sequences one point and not a set of points.

**Completeness is a property of the pair $(X,d)$, not of $X$ and not of the
topology of $d$.** Both quantifiers in the definition are about the metric: the
Cauchy condition is stated with distances, and so is convergence. Two metrics on
the same set can have the same open sets while exactly one of them is complete,
which is the content of [[fs-completeness-is-a-topological-property]] and its
witness. Read the word *complete* as an abbreviation for *complete with respect
to this metric*, always.

## Remarks

- **Do not confuse this with Dedekind completeness.** The least-upper-bound
  property of [[def-complete-ordered-field]] is an order condition on an ordered
  field and is what defines $\mathbb{R}$; the condition here is a metric
  condition and makes sense in any metric space, with no order in sight. On
  $\mathbb{R}$ the first implies the second ([[thm-cauchy-criterion-via-lub]],
  [[thm-euclidean-space-complete]]) and the two are not the same statement: the
  rationals with the usual metric are an ordered field that fails both, while
  there are complete metric spaces with no field structure at all.
- **Every convergent sequence is Cauchy** ([[lem-metric-convergent-implies-cauchy]]),
  so completeness is exactly the assertion that the two classes of sequences
  coincide. It is the converse inclusion that carries all the content.
- **Three sources of completeness are proved on this page.** The real line and
  $\mathbb{R}^n$ are complete ([[thm-euclidean-space-complete]]); a closed subset
  of a complete space is complete ([[thm-complete-subspace-iff-closed]]); and
  every metric space sits densely and isometrically inside a complete one
  ([[thm-metric-completion-exists]]).

## Definition

Let $V$ be a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-vector-space]]) and let $M$
and $N$ be norms on $V$ ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]). $M$ and $N$ are
**equivalent** when there are reals $c > 0$ and $C > 0$ with

$$c\,M(v) \;\le\; N(v) \;\le\; C\,M(v) \qquad \text{for every } v \in V .$$

The constants are not part of the data and are not unique: any smaller $c$ and
any larger $C$ serve as well.

### This is an equivalence relation on the norms on $V$

- **Reflexive:** take $c = C = 1$.
- **Symmetric:** from $cM \le N \le CM$ and $c, C > 0$ one gets
  $C^{-1}N \le M \le c^{-1}N$, dividing by the positive constants
  ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).
- **Transitive:** if $cM \le N \le CM$ and $c'N \le P \le C'N$ then
  $c'c\,M \le P \le C'C\,M$, and $c'c > 0$, $C'C > 0$, a product of positives
  being positive.

### The dictionary with equivalent metrics

Let $d_M(u,v) = M(u-v)$ and $d_N(u,v) = N(u-v)$ be the induced metrics
([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]). Substituting $v := u - w$ in the displayed
condition gives

$$c\,d_M(u,w) \;\le\; d_N(u,w) \;\le\; C\,d_M(u,w) \qquad \text{for all } u, w \in V ,$$

which is **verbatim the Lipschitz equivalence** of $d_M$ and $d_N$ in the sense
of [[def-equivalent-metrics]], with $\alpha = c$ and $\beta = C$. That is the
**strongest** of the three tiers that item distinguishes: by
[[thm-metric-equivalence-hierarchy]], Lipschitz equivalence implies uniform
equivalence, which implies topological equivalence. So equivalent norms give

- the same open sets, hence the same closed sets, closures and interiors
  ([[def-metric-topology]]);
- the same uniformly continuous maps into and out of $V$
  ([[def-metric-uniform-continuity]]);
- the same convergent sequences with the same limits, and the same Cauchy
  sequences ([[def-metric-convergence]], [[def-cauchy-in-metric]]).

The last line deserves its two-line verification, since it is used constantly
below and is not literally a clause of [[thm-metric-equivalence-hierarchy]]. If
$d_M(v_k, v) \to 0$ then $0 \le d_N(v_k,v) \le C\,d_M(v_k,v)$, so given a
rational $\varepsilon > 0$ an index beyond which $d_M(v_k,v) < \varepsilon/C$
serves for $d_N$; the converse uses $d_M \le c^{-1}d_N$ in the same way. The
Cauchy statement is the same estimate applied to $d_N(v_k,v_l)$. In particular
$(V, d_M)$ is complete if and only if $(V,d_N)$ is.

**Naming.** Many texts say *strongly equivalent* for what
[[def-equivalent-metrics]] calls Lipschitz equivalent, and simply *equivalent*
for what it calls topologically equivalent. As there, this library always writes
the qualifier for metrics. For **norms** there is no fork to guard against: the
condition displayed above is the only one anyone calls equivalence of norms, and
it is always the Lipschitz-strength one.

## Remarks

- **The converse of the dictionary fails.** A metric on $V$ that is equivalent to
  a norm metric need not itself come from a norm: [[lem-bounded-remetrisation]]
  turns any metric $d$ into $d' = \min\{d,1\}$, uniformly equivalent to $d$ and
  bounded, and a bounded metric on a nonzero vector space is not induced by any
  norm, since absolute homogeneity would make $d'(\lambda v, 0)$ unbounded in
  $\lambda$ ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]). So "equivalent to a norm metric" is
  strictly weaker than "induced by an equivalent norm".

- **Equivalence is a statement about a fixed vector space.** Two norms on
  different spaces are never compared. On $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with $n \ge 1$ the
  norms $\lVert\cdot\rVert_1$, $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ and
  $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ of [[def-p-norms-on-rn]] are equivalent, with
  explicit constants proved in
  [[lem-every-norm-on-rn-is-continuous-for-the-euclidean-metric]]; that every
  pair of norms on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is equivalent is
  [[thm-all-norms-on-rn-are-equivalent]]. Neither statement survives to spaces
  that are not finite-dimensional, and the companion page carries the witness.

- **Equivalence says nothing about the geometry.** Equivalent norms have the same
  convergent sequences and the same open sets; they may still have quite
  different unit balls, and one of them may come from an inner product while the
  other does not. [[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]]
  records the metric identifications and nothing more.

## Definition

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $m \in \mathbb{R}$.

- $m$ is a **maximum** (or *greatest element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $s \le m$
  for every $s \in S$.
- $m$ is a **minimum** (or *least element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $m \le s$
  for every $s \in S$.

A set has at most one maximum: if $m_1$ and $m_2$ are both maxima then
$m_1 \in S$ gives $m_1 \le m_2$ and $m_2 \in S$ gives $m_2 \le m_1$, so
$m_1 = m_2$ by antisymmetry of the order, which is immediate from the trichotomy
axiom of an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).
The same argument applies to minima, so we may write $\max S$ and $\min S$.

## Remarks

- A maximum is precisely an upper bound of $S$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]])
  that happens to lie in $S$; a minimum is a lower bound of $S$
  ([[def-bounded-set]]) that lies in $S$. In particular a set with a maximum is
  bounded above and a set with a minimum is bounded below.
- The empty set has neither a maximum nor a minimum, because the requirement
  $m \in S$ cannot be met.
- The membership requirement $m \in S$ is exactly what separates a maximum from a
  supremum, and it is the theme of this page. A supremum is a bound on the set
  and is not asked to belong to it; a maximum is an element of the set. The two
  agree exactly when the supremum happens to be attained ([[lem-max-is-sup]]),
  and they genuinely differ in general ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has both a maximum and a minimum
  ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]), which is what licenses the notation
  $\max\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$. Infinite sets need not: the failure of attainment is
  an infinitary phenomenon.

## Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]).

A **sequence in $X$** is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to X$, written $(x_k)$ with
$x_k := x(k)$. As everywhere in this library, $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
([[def-natural-numbers]]) and a sequence is indexed from $0$
([[def-sequence]]); an index range copied from a text that starts at $1$ must be
shifted before it is used here.

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence in $X$ and $p \in X$. The function
$k \mapsto d(x_k, p)$ is a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]), and it is
nonnegative ([[lem-metric-nonnegativity]]), so $|d(x_k,p)| = d(x_k,p)$
([[def-abs-value]]). Define

$$x_k \longrightarrow p \text{ in } (X,d) \quad :\Longleftrightarrow \quad d(x_k,p) \longrightarrow 0 \text{ in } \mathbb{R},$$

the convergence on the right being that of [[def-real-limit]]. Unwound, this
says: for every **rational** $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with
$d(x_k, p) < \varepsilon$ for every $k \ge K$. We then call $p$ a **limit** of
$(x_k)$, and say $(x_k)$ **converges** in $(X,d)$ if it has a limit.

**Rational and real $\varepsilon$ agree here, as they do on the real line.**
[[def-real-limit]] tests convergence against rational $\varepsilon$ only, and its
own remark, restated for sequences in [[def-sequence]], records that nothing is
lost: below any real $\eta > 0$ lies a positive rational
([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and the index belonging to that rational serves for
$\eta$. So a proof may establish convergence by producing an index for every
real $\varepsilon > 0$, and may use a convergence hypothesis at a real
$\varepsilon$ by first passing to a rational below it. Both moves are used on
this page and are always cited.

**Subsequences and subsequential limits.** A **subsequence** of $(x_k)$ is the
composite $x \circ n$ for a strictly increasing $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$,
written $(x_{n_j})$, exactly as for sequences of reals ([[def-sequence]]); and
$p$ is a **subsequential limit** of $(x_k)$ in $(X,d)$ when some subsequence
converges to $p$, which is the metric-space form of [[def-subsequential-limit]].

## Remarks

- **A limit is a point of $X$, and uniqueness is a theorem.** Nothing in the
  definition rules out two limits; that a sequence in a metric space has at most
  one is [[lem-metric-limits-unique]], and its proof is where the separation
  axiom (M1) is spent. Reading the same definition with a pseudometric
  ([[def-metric-space]]) that is not a metric, that is one with $p(a,b) = 0$ for
  some $a \ne b$, limits are genuinely not unique: the constant sequence at $a$
  converges to $b$ as well.
- **Convergence is defined from the metric but determined by the topology.**
  It can be restated as "every open set containing $p$ contains $x_k$ for all
  large $k$", which follows from [[lem-metric-ball-neighbourhood-base]]; so it is
  unchanged by passing to a topologically equivalent metric
  ([[def-equivalent-metrics]]). That restatement is not made part of the
  definition, because the metric form is what every proof on this page uses.
- **The relation between convergence and closure** is
  [[thm-metric-sequential-closure]]: a point lies in the closure of $A$ exactly
  when some sequence in $A$ converges to it.

Throughout this page $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) constructed in this library, in particular a
field, so that "vector space" below always means vector space over $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-vector-space]]).

Let $V$ be a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$, with zero vector $0_V$. A **norm on
$V$** is a function $N : V \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $u, v \in V$ and all
$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$:

- **(N1) Separation.** $N(v) = 0$ if and only if $v = 0_V$.
- **(N2) Absolute homogeneity.** $N(\lambda v) = |\lambda|\,N(v)$, the absolute
  value being that of [[def-abs-value]].
- **(N3) Triangle inequality.** $N(u + v) \le N(u) + N(v)$.

A **normed space** is a pair $(V, N)$ consisting of a vector space $V$ over
$\mathbb{R}$ and a norm $N$ on it. When only one norm is in play we write
$\lVert v\rVert$ for $N(v)$; when several are, the norm is always named.

**The values of a norm are real numbers.** The codomain is $\mathbb{R}$, so
$N(v)$ is an honest element of the complete ordered field and no infinite value
is permitted. This is the same convention [[rem-metric-axiom-conventions]]
records for metrics.

### Nonnegativity is a theorem, not an axiom

Many texts add a fourth condition $N(v) \ge 0$. It is redundant. Applying (N2)
with $\lambda = -1$ gives $N(-v) = |-1|\,N(v) = N(v)$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]],
[[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]] for $(-1)v = -v$), and then (N3)
with $u = v$ and $-v$ gives

$$0 \;=\; N(0_V) \;=\; N\bigl(v + (-v)\bigr) \;\le\; N(v) + N(-v) \;=\; N(v) + N(v),$$

where $N(0_V) = 0$ is (N1). So $N(v) + N(v) \ge 0$, and if $N(v) < 0$ then
$N(v) + N(v) < 0$ by addition of inequalities, which trichotomy forbids
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]). Hence $N(v) \ge 0$ for every $v \in V$.

**Consequently the verification of a candidate norm has three things to check and
not four**, exactly as the verification of a candidate metric has three and not
four ([[def-metric-space]], [[lem-metric-nonnegativity]]). No item in this
library assumes nonnegativity of a norm before the argument above.

### The induced metric

Let $N$ be a norm on $V$ and define

$$d_N(u,v) \;:=\; N(u - v) \qquad (u, v \in V),$$

where $u - v = u + (-v)$ ([[def-vector-space]]). **Then $d_N$ is a metric on
$V$** ([[def-metric-space]]), and the three axioms are the three conditions
above, in order:

- **(M1)** $d_N(u,v) = 0$ means $N(u-v) = 0$, which by (N1) says $u - v = 0_V$,
  that is $u = v$; and conversely $d_N(v,v) = N(0_V) = 0$.
- **(M2)** $d_N(v,u) = N(v-u) = N\bigl((-1)(u-v)\bigr) = |-1|\,N(u-v) = d_N(u,v)$,
  by (N2), [[lem-of-abs-value]] and $(-1)w = -w$
  ([[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]]).
- **(M3)** $d_N(u,w) = N\bigl((u-v) + (v-w)\bigr) \le N(u-v) + N(v-w) = d_N(u,v) + d_N(v,w)$,
  by (N3).

A normed space is therefore a metric space, and every notion defined for metric
spaces — open set ([[def-metric-topology]]), convergence, Cauchyness,
continuity, compactness — is available in it with no further definition. **This
library never introduces a second notion of any of them for normed spaces.**

### Two properties an arbitrary metric need not have

The metric $d_N$ satisfies, for all $u, v, w \in V$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$:

- **translation invariance**, $d_N(u + w, v + w) = N\bigl((u+w)-(v+w)\bigr) = N(u-v) = d_N(u,v)$;
- **absolute homogeneity**, $d_N(\lambda u, \lambda v) = N\bigl(\lambda(u-v)\bigr) = |\lambda|\,d_N(u,v)$, by (N2).

**Not every metric on a vector space arises from a norm**, and homogeneity is
what fails. The published bounded remetrisation [[lem-bounded-remetrisation]]
replaces a metric $d$ by $d' = \min\{d, 1\}$, a metric with the same topology
whose values never exceed $1$; on a vector space $V$ containing a vector $v$ with
$d(v, 0_V) > 0$ this $d'$ cannot be $d_M$ for any norm $M$, since absolute
homogeneity would force $d'(\lambda v, 0_V) = |\lambda|\,d'(v, 0_V)$, which is
unbounded in $\lambda$, while $d'$ is bounded by $1$. So the passage from norms
to metrics is not reversible, and a statement about a metric on a vector space is
strictly weaker than the corresponding statement about a norm.

## Remarks

- **Why (N1) is stated as an equivalence.** The direction $N(0_V) = 0$ is forced
  by (N2) with $\lambda = 0$, since $0\,v = 0_V$
  ([[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]]) gives $N(0_V) = |0|\,N(v) = 0$.
  Only the direction "$N(v) = 0$ implies $v = 0_V$" is a genuine assumption, and
  dropping it gives what is usually called a seminorm, a notion this library does
  not use. The situation is exactly the one [[rem-metric-axiom-conventions]]
  describes for (M1) and the pseudometric.

- **The zero space carries exactly one norm.** If $V = \{0_V\}$ then the only
  function $V \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying (N1) is the one with value $0$, and it
  satisfies (N2) and (N3) trivially. In particular $\mathbb{R}^{0}$, the function
  space on the empty index set ([[def-function-space]]), is a normed space,
  although the metrics of the published metric theory on $\mathbb{R}^n$ are
  defined only for $n \ge 1$.

- **What is not defined here.** This item does not define linear maps; their
  published definition is [[def-linear-map]]. It also does not define operator
  norms, dual spaces, or abstract inner product spaces.
  [[rem-rn-conventions-and-scope]] records the remaining scope boundaries and
  what each later development would license.

## Definition

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be the function space of
[[def-euclidean-inner-product]], with $x_k := x(k)$ for $k < n$.

### The $p$-norm, for a rational exponent $p \ge 1$

Let $p \in \mathbb{Q}$ with $p \ge 1$. For $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ put

$$\lVert x\rVert_p \;:=\; \Bigl(\sum_{k<n} |x_k|^{p}\Bigr)^{1/p},$$

where $|\cdot|$ is the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]), the sum is the finite
sum of [[def-finite-sum]], and both powers are the **rational** powers of
[[def-rational-power]].

**Every power written here is defined.** Each base $|x_k|$ is a nonnegative real
and $p > 0$, so $|x_k|^{p}$ is given by [[def-rational-power]] for $|x_k| > 0$
and by its supplementary clause $0^{p} = 0$ for $|x_k| = 0$; the sum of these
nonnegative terms is nonnegative ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 4), and
$1/p$ is a positive rational, so the outer power is defined for the same two
reasons. The value does not depend on which representative of $p$ or of $1/p$ is
used ([[lem-rational-power-well-defined]]).

**The exponent is a rational, and that is not a matter of taste.**
[[def-rational-power]] supplies $a^{r}$ for a nonnegative base and a **rational**
exponent only; real exponents do not exist at this point in the reading order,
and [[rem-real-exponents-deferred]] records exactly why. This is also why the
published Minkowski inequality [[thm-minkowski-finite]], which is what makes the
triangle inequality work below, is itself stated for rational $p \ge 1$. **No
statement on this page is written for $p$ ranging over a real interval.**

### The maximum norm

For $n \ge 1$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ put

$$\lVert x\rVert_\infty \;:=\; \max\{\, |x_k| \;:\; k < n \,\},$$

the maximum of a nonempty finite set of reals, which exists and is one of its
elements ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

**The hypothesis $n \ge 1$ is required and propagates.** At $n = 0$ the set
$\{|x_k| : k<n\}$ is empty and has no maximum ([[def-max-min]]). This is the same
restriction the published [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] carries, for the same reason, and
**every statement on this page that mentions $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ inherits
it**. The $p$-norms for rational $p \ge 1$ carry no such restriction: at $n = 0$
each is the empty sum raised to a positive rational power, hence $0$.

### The three cases the rest of the page uses

- $\lVert x\rVert_1 = \sum_{k<n}|x_k|$, since $t^{1} = t$ for $t \ge 0$
  ([[lem-rational-power-laws]], and $0^{1} = 0$ by the supplementary clause).
- $\lVert x\rVert_2 = \bigl(\sum_{k<n}|x_k|^{2}\bigr)^{1/2} = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}x_k^{2}}$,
  which is exactly the Euclidean norm of [[def-euclidean-inner-product]]: the
  exponent $2$ agrees with the integer power, so $|x_k|^{2} = x_k^{2}$
  ([[lem-of-abs-value]]), and $t^{1/2}$ is the unique nonnegative square root of
  $t$, which is $\sqrt{t}$ ([[def-rational-power]], [[thm-of-square-roots]]).
  **The two notations denote the same function and no second Euclidean norm is
  introduced.**
- $\lVert x\rVert_\infty$ as above, for $n \ge 1$.

That each of these is a norm in the sense of [[def-norm-and-normed-space]], and
that the metrics they induce are exactly the published $d_1$, $d_2$ and
$d_\infty$ of [[lem-metrics-on-rn]], is
[[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]]; it is proved there
and is not assumed here.

## Remarks

- **Why $p \ge 1$.** The triangle inequality for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$ is
  Minkowski's inequality, and [[thm-minkowski-finite]] is stated for rational
  $p \ge 1$. For $0 < p < 1$ the displayed expression is still defined but is not
  a norm on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n \ge 2$; nothing on this page asserts anything
  about that range, and the expression is never written with such an exponent.

- **Monotonicity in the base is what makes the comparisons below work.** For a
  fixed positive rational $r$ the map $a \mapsto a^{r}$ is strictly increasing on
  the positive reals ([[lem-rational-power-monotone]] clause 2), so an inequality
  between nonnegative sums passes through the outer power. That is the only
  property of rational powers used in the comparison chain of
  [[lem-every-norm-on-rn-is-continuous-for-the-euclidean-metric]].

- **The subscript $\infty$ is a name, not a number.** No arithmetic is performed
  with it, and $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ is not $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$ for any
  exponent; it is a separately defined function that happens to sit at the end of
  the family. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$ silently that
  [[def-interval]] records for the interval notation.

## Definition

A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals **converges** to $x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for
every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with
$|x_k - x| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$. It is **Cauchy** when for

$|x_k - x_l| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$.

## Remarks

- Quantifying over rational $\varepsilon$ loses nothing: below any real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ lies a positive rational ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).
- $|\cdot|$ is the absolute value of [[def-real-order]].

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]],
[[def-real-numbers]]) with its order and absolute value ([[def-real-order]]), and
$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers with its order ([[def-natural-numbers]],
[[def-nat-order]]).

A **sequence of reals** is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$. We write
$x_k$ for the value $x(k)$, call it the **$k$-th term**, and write $(x_k)$, or
$(x_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$, for the function itself. The **range** of $(x_k)$ is
the subset $\{\, x_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals and let $P$ be a property of indices.

- $(x_k)$ is **bounded** if there is $M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for
  every $k \in \mathbb{N}$; it is **unbounded** otherwise.
- $P$ holds **eventually** if there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $P(k)$ holds
  for every $k \ge K$.
- $P$ holds **frequently** if for every $K \in \mathbb{N}$ there is some
  $k \ge K$ for which $P(k)$ holds.
- For $K \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$K$-th tail** of $(x_k)$ is the sequence
  $x^{(K)}$ defined by $x^{(K)}_j := x_{j + K}$ for $j \in \mathbb{N}$; it is
  again a sequence of reals.
- A function $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is **strictly increasing** if
  $n_j < n_k$ whenever $j < k$. For such an $n$, the **subsequence** of $(x_k)$
  along $n$ is the composite $x \circ n$, written $(x_{n_k})_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$;
  it is again a sequence of reals.

**Convergence and Cauchyness are not defined here.** They are already fixed, for
sequences of reals, by the published [[def-real-limit]]: $(x_k)$ *converges* to
$x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is
$K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$, and $(x_k)$
is *Cauchy* when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$
with $|x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$. This page builds the
toolkit for those two notions and does not restate them. A sequence
**converges** if it converges to some real, and **diverges** if it does not.

## Remarks

- **Identification of $\mathbb{Q}$ with its image.** The map $q \mapsto \hat q$
  is an embedding of ordered fields ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and as is
  standard we write $q$ for $\hat q$, so that a rational may be compared with a
  real without further comment. [[def-real-limit]] is stated with the hat; every
  rational $\varepsilon$ occurring on this page is its image under this
  embedding.

- **Rational and real $\varepsilon$ agree.** [[def-real-limit]] tests convergence
  against every *rational* $\varepsilon > 0$, and its own remark records that
  this loses nothing. Spelled out: suppose that for every rational
  $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all
  $k \ge K$, and let $\eta > 0$ be an arbitrary *real*. Since $0 < \eta$,
  density of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) supplies a
  rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, and the index $K$
  belonging to that $\varepsilon$ satisfies $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon < \eta$ for
  all $k \ge K$. The converse implication is immediate, since every positive
  rational is a positive real. So the two formulations define the same relation,
  and the same two lines apply verbatim to the Cauchy condition and to any
  condition of the shape "for every $\varepsilon > 0$, eventually
  $\cdots < \varepsilon$". Proofs on this page therefore run the test with a real
  $\varepsilon$ wherever that is more convenient, and say so by citing this
  remark; nothing is smuggled in.

- **Constant sequences converge.** For $c \in \mathbb{R}$ the constant sequence
  $x_k := c$ converges to $c$, because $|x_k - c| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ for
  every $\varepsilon > 0$ and every $k$; it is bounded by $|c|$.

- **Eventually and frequently are dual.** $P$ holds frequently exactly when
  $\lnot P$ does not hold eventually, and $P$ holds eventually exactly when
  $\lnot P$ does not hold frequently. So the two quantifier patterns are
  negations of one another applied to the complementary property, and there is no
  third pattern hiding between them.

- **A sequence is not its range.** $(x_k)$ is a function, not a set, and the
  range does not determine the function: the sequence $x_0 = 0$, $x_k = 1$ for
  $k \ge 1$ and the sequence $y_0 = y_1 = 0$, $y_k = 1$ for $k \ge 2$ have the
  same range $\{0, 1\}$, yet they differ at $k = 1$, so they are different
  sequences. Order and repetition are part of the data and the range forgets
  both. Boundedness, on the other hand, depends only on the range.

- **Indexing.** Sequences here start at $k = 0$ because $\mathbb{N}$ contains
  $0$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]). Texts that index from $1$ describe the same
  objects up to a shift, and the shift changes nothing about convergence, by
  [[lem-limit-of-tail]].

## Statement

**Clause 1 is about an arbitrary norm; clauses 2 to 4 are about
$\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with $n \ge 1$.**

1. **Finite and reverse triangle inequalities.** Let $V$ be a vector space over
   $\mathbb{R}$ and $N$ a norm on it ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]). For every
   $p \in \mathbb{N}$ and every list $u : p \to V$
   ([[def-linear-combination-and-span]]),
   $$N\Bigl(\sum_{j<p} u_j\Bigr) \;\le\; \sum_{j<p} N(u_j),$$
   and for all $u, w \in V$,
   $$\bigl|N(u) - N(w)\bigr| \;\le\; N(u - w).$$

Now let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, let $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ carry the norms of
[[def-p-norms-on-rn]] and write $\iota$ for the canonical natural
([[def-canonical-natural]]).

2. **Every norm is dominated by the $1$-norm.** Let $N$ be a norm on
   $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and put $C := \max\{\, N(e_k) : k<n \,\}$, a maximum over a
   nonempty finite set of reals ([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]],
   [[lem-finite-set-has-max]]). Then $C \ge 0$ and
   $$N(x) \;\le\; C\,\lVert x\rVert_1 \qquad \text{for every } x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}.$$
3. **The comparison chain.** For every $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$,
   $$\lVert x\rVert_\infty \;\le\; \lVert x\rVert_2 \;\le\; \lVert x\rVert_1 \;\le\; \iota(n)\,\lVert x\rVert_\infty , \qquad \lVert x\rVert_1 \;\le\; \sqrt{\iota(n)}\;\lVert x\rVert_2 .$$
   In particular $\lVert\cdot\rVert_1$, $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ and
   $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ are pairwise equivalent norms on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$,
   with the constants displayed ([[def-equivalent-norms]]).
4. **Every norm is Lipschitz for the Euclidean metric.** With $N$ and $C$ as in
   clause 2, $N : (\mathbb{R}^{n}, d_2) \to (\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$ is
   Lipschitz with constant $C\sqrt{\iota(n)}$
   ([[def-lipschitz-holder-contraction]], [[lem-metrics-on-rn]],
   [[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]), hence uniformly continuous and
   continuous ([[thm-metric-regularity-hierarchy]], [[def-metric-continuity]]).

**Where $n \ge 1$ enters.** Clauses 2 and 4 need the maximum defining $C$ to
exist, and clause 3 mentions $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$; at $n = 0$ each is a
maximum over the empty index set and does not exist, exactly as in
[[lem-metrics-on-rn]] and [[def-p-norms-on-rn]]. Clause 1 carries no hypothesis
on the dimension and no hypothesis on the space.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A vector space $V$ over $\mathbb{R}$ with a norm $N$ ([[def-vector-space]], [[def-norm-and-normed-space]]); and, for clauses 2 to 4, a natural $n \ge 1$, the space $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, a norm $N$ on it, and vectors $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$.

[L1] The norm axioms: $N(v) = 0$ exactly when $v = 0_V$; $N(\lambda v) = |\lambda|N(v)$; $N(u+w) \le N(u)+N(w)$; and $N(v) \ge 0$ ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]).

[L2] Finite sums in a vector space: $\sum_{j<0}u_j = 0_V$ and $\sum_{j<p+1}u_j = \bigl(\sum_{j<p}u_j\bigr) + u_p$ ([[def-linear-combination-and-span]]); and $(-1)v = -v$ ([[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]]).

[L3] The induction principle ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L4] Laws of finite sums of reals ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[def-finite-sum]]): additivity, scaling, monotonicity, $\sum_{k<n}\lambda = \iota(n)\lambda$, a sum of nonnegative terms is nonnegative, and every single term is at most such a sum.

[L5] The standard basis: $e_i \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ has $e_i(i) = 1$ and $e_i(j) = 0$ for $j \ne i$, $e$ is an ordered basis of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and every $x$ satisfies $x = \sum_{i<n}x_i e_i$ with coordinate list $i \mapsto x(i)$ ([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]] clauses 1 to 3, [[thm-unique-coordinates-with-respect-to-an-ordered-basis]]).

[L6] Maxima ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]): a nonempty finite set of reals has a maximum, which belongs to the set and bounds it above.

[L7] The three norms ([[def-p-norms-on-rn]], [[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]]): $\lVert x\rVert_1 = \sum_{k<n}|x_k|$, $\lVert x\rVert_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}x_k^{2}}$, $\lVert x\rVert_\infty = \max\{|x_k| : k<n\}$, and each induces the correspondingly named published metric.

[L8] Cauchy-Schwarz in root form ([[thm-cauchy-schwarz-finite]]): $\bigl|\sum_{k<n}a_kb_k\bigr| \le \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}a_k^{2}}\sqrt{\sum_{k<n}b_k^{2}}$.

[L9] Square roots and squaring ([[thm-of-square-roots]], [[lem-of-square-monotone]]): every $c \ge 0$ has a unique $\sqrt{c} \ge 0$ with $(\sqrt{c})^{2} = c$; for $a,b \ge 0$, $a \le b$ exactly when $a^{2} \le b^{2}$.

[L10] Absolute value ([[lem-of-abs-value]]): $|t| \ge 0$, $|t|^{2} = t^{2}$, $|st| = |s||t|$, $|-t| = |t|$, and $|t|$ equals $t$ or $-t$.

[L11] The canonical natural: $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L12] Lipschitz maps and the regularity hierarchy ([[def-lipschitz-holder-contraction]], [[thm-metric-regularity-hierarchy]], [[def-metric-continuity]]): a map with $d_Y(f(x),f(y)) \le L\,d_X(x,y)$ and $L \ge 0$ is Lipschitz, hence uniformly continuous, hence continuous; $d_{\mathbb{R}}(s,t) = |s-t|$ ([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The finite triangle inequality holds by induction on $p$: at $p = 0$ both sides are $0$, since $\sum_{j<0}u_j = 0_V$ and $N(0_V) = 0$ and the empty real sum is $0$; and if $N(\sum_{j<p}u_j) \le \sum_{j<p}N(u_j)$, then $N(\sum_{j<p+1}u_j) = N(\sum_{j<p}u_j + u_p) \le N(\sum_{j<p}u_j) + N(u_p) \le \sum_{j<p}N(u_j) + N(u_p) = \sum_{j<p+1}N(u_j)$. [L1, L2, L3, L4]

1.2 For $u, w \in V$: $N(u) = N((u-w)+w) \le N(u-w) + N(w)$, so $N(u)-N(w) \le N(u-w)$; and $N(w-u) = N((-1)(u-w)) = |-1|N(u-w) = N(u-w)$, so the same argument with $u$ and $w$ exchanged gives $N(w)-N(u) \le N(u-w)$. Since $|N(u)-N(w)|$ is one of $N(u)-N(w)$ and $N(w)-N(u)$, the reverse triangle inequality follows, completing clause 1. [L1, L2, L10]

1.3 For every $j<n$: $x_j^{2} \le \sum_{k<n}x_k^{2}$, since every single term of a sum of nonnegative terms is at most the sum; taking nonnegative square roots and using $|x_j|^{2} = x_j^{2}$ gives $|x_j| \le \lVert x\rVert_2$. [L4, L7, L9, L10]

1.4 For every $j<n$: $|x_j| \le \sum_{k<n}|x_k| = \lVert x\rVert_1$, again because a single term is at most the sum. [L4, L7, L10]

1.5 $\sum_{k<n}|x_k| \le \sum_{k<n}\lVert x\rVert_\infty = \iota(n)\lVert x\rVert_\infty$, since $|x_k| \le \lVert x\rVert_\infty$ for every $k<n$ and a constant list sums to $\iota(n)$ times its value; so $\lVert x\rVert_1 \le \iota(n)\lVert x\rVert_\infty$. [L4, L6, L7, L11]

1.6 Instantiating [L8] at $a_k := |x_k|$ and $b_k := 1$ gives $\lVert x\rVert_1 = \bigl|\sum_{k<n}|x_k|\cdot 1\bigr| \le \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}|x_k|^{2}}\,\sqrt{\sum_{k<n}1} = \lVert x\rVert_2\sqrt{\iota(n)}$. [L4, L7, L8, L10]

1.7 The set $\{N(e_k) : k<n\}$ is a nonempty finite set of reals because $n \ge 1$, so $C = \max\{N(e_k) : k<n\}$ exists, belongs to the set, satisfies $N(e_k) \le C$ for every $k<n$, and is $\ge 0$ since every value of $N$ is. [L1, L5, L6]

1.8 $x = \sum_{i<n} x_i e_i$, the coordinate list of $x$ with respect to the ordered basis $e$ being $i \mapsto x(i) = x_i$. [L5]

2.1 $\lVert x\rVert_\infty$ is one of the numbers $|x_j|$ with $j<n$, so step 1.3 gives $\lVert x\rVert_\infty \le \lVert x\rVert_2$. [step 1.3, L6, L7]

2.2 $\sum_{k<n}x_k^{2} = \sum_{k<n}|x_k|\,|x_k| \le \sum_{k<n}|x_k|\,\lVert x\rVert_1 = \lVert x\rVert_1\sum_{k<n}|x_k| = \lVert x\rVert_1^{2}$, using step 1.4 termwise, monotonicity and scaling; taking nonnegative square roots gives $\lVert x\rVert_2 \le \lVert x\rVert_1$. [step 1.4, L4, L7, L9, L10]

2.3 Applying step 1.1 to the list $i \mapsto x_i e_i$ and then (N2): $N(x) = N\bigl(\sum_{i<n}x_ie_i\bigr) \le \sum_{i<n}N(x_ie_i) = \sum_{i<n}|x_i|\,N(e_i) \le \sum_{i<n}|x_i|\,C = C\lVert x\rVert_1$, the last inequality by monotonicity from step 1.7. This is clause 2. [step 1.1, step 1.7, step 1.8, L1, L4, L7]

3.1 Steps 2.1, 2.2, 1.5 and 1.6 are the four inequalities of clause 3; since $\iota(n) > 0$ and $\sqrt{\iota(n)} > 0$, they exhibit positive constants in both directions for each of the three pairs, so the three norms are pairwise equivalent. [step 1.5, step 1.6, step 2.1, step 2.2, L11, L9]

3.2 By step 1.2 applied on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, then step 2.3, then step 1.6: $\bigl|N(x)-N(y)\bigr| \le N(x-y) \le C\lVert x-y\rVert_1 \le C\sqrt{\iota(n)}\;\lVert x-y\rVert_2$. [step 1.2, step 1.6, step 2.3, L4]

4.1 Since $\lVert x-y\rVert_2 = d_2(x,y)$ and $\bigl|N(x)-N(y)\bigr| = d_{\mathbb{R}}(N(x),N(y))$, step 3.2 says exactly that $N$ is Lipschitz with the nonnegative constant $C\sqrt{\iota(n)}$, hence uniformly continuous and continuous; this is clause 4, and with steps 1.2, 2.3 and 3.1 all four clauses are proved. [step 1.2, step 2.3, step 3.1, step 3.2, L7, L12] ∎

## Remarks

- **Clause 2 is the half of norm equivalence that costs no compactness.** It gives an upper bound for an arbitrary norm in terms of $\lVert\cdot\rVert_1$, and hence in terms of $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ by clause 3, by a computation with the standard basis alone. The matching **lower** bound is where compactness of the unit sphere enters, and that is [[thm-all-norms-on-rn-are-equivalent]].

- **The constants of clause 3 are best possible, and the companion page shows it.** Nothing here claims sharpness; the attaining vectors are exhibited on the companion page for $\mathbb{R}^{2}$.

- **Clause 1 is stated for a general norm on purpose.** It is used below for the Euclidean norm on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ inside [[thm-steinitz-polygonal-confinement]] and for an arbitrary $N$ in clause 2, and it is the only statement on this page that needs no hypothesis on the dimension at all.

## Statement

For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and all $a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n \in \mathbb{R}$, the
set $\{a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ has a maximum and a minimum ([[def-max-min]]).

What is proved below is exactly the displayed statement, by induction on $n$.

The usual reading, that *every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has a
maximum and a minimum*, follows once one identifies the nonempty finite subsets
of $\mathbb{R}$ with the sets listable as $\{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$. That
identification is recorded as a stipulation in the Given below, because this page
has no definition of finiteness to prove it against. **It is discharged, not
merely assumed**: [[lem-finite-subsets-listable]] proves that the two
descriptions of a nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ agree. That lemma is
recorded in `justified_by` rather than in `deps`, since it is about the sets this
lemma quantifies over and therefore depends on this one. This is what licenses
the notation
$\max\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ and $\min\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ for finite sets of
**real** numbers from this page onwards.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Real numbers $a_0, a_1, a_2, \dots$; for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write $F_n := \{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$, so that $F_{n+1} = F_n \cup \{a_{n+1}\}$. A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and finite exactly when it equals $F_n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and some choice of $a_0, \dots, a_n$.

[A1] $P(n)$ denotes the statement: for all $a_0, \dots, a_n \in \mathbb{R}$, the set $F_n$ has a maximum and a minimum.

[L1] Maximum and minimum: $m = \max X$ means $m \in X$ and $x \le m$ for all $x \in X$; $m = \min X$ means $m \in X$ and $m \le x$ for all $x \in X$; each is unique when it exists ([[def-max-min]]).

[L2] Induction principle: if $P(0)$ holds and $P(n)$ implies $P(n+1)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $P(n)$ holds for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, where $n + 1$ denotes the successor $\sigma(n)$ ([[thm-induction-principle]], [[def-nat-addition]]).

[L3] The order on $\mathbb{R}$ is reflexive, total and transitive: $a \le a$; for all $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds, so at least one of $a \le b$ and $b \le a$ holds; and $a \le b$ with $b \le c$ gives $a \le c$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case: $F_0 = \{a_0\}$, and $a_0 \in F_0$ with $a_0 \le a_0$ by reflexivity, so $a_0$ is both a maximum and a minimum of $F_0$; hence $P(0)$ holds. [base, A1, L1, L3]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume $P(n)$, that is, for all reals $a_0, \dots, a_n$ the set $F_n$ has a maximum and a minimum. [ih, A1]

2.1 Let $a_0, \dots, a_{n+1} \in \mathbb{R}$ be arbitrary; by the inductive hypothesis the set $F_n$ has a maximum $M$ and a minimum $m$, and $F_{n+1} = F_n \cup \{a_{n+1}\}$. [step 1.2, L1]

3.1 By totality at least one of $a_{n+1} \le M$ and $M \le a_{n+1}$ holds. If $a_{n+1} \le M$, then $M \in F_n \subseteq F_{n+1}$, every element of $F_n$ is $\le M$ because $M = \max F_n$, and $a_{n+1} \le M$ as well, so $M$ is a maximum of $F_{n+1}$. If $M \le a_{n+1}$, then $a_{n+1} \in F_{n+1}$, every $x \in F_n$ satisfies $x \le M \le a_{n+1}$ hence $x \le a_{n+1}$ by transitivity, and $a_{n+1} \le a_{n+1}$, so $a_{n+1}$ is a maximum of $F_{n+1}$. Either way $F_{n+1}$ has a maximum. [step 2.1, L1, L3]

3.2 Dually, at least one of $m \le a_{n+1}$ and $a_{n+1} \le m$ holds. If $m \le a_{n+1}$, then $m \in F_{n+1}$ and every element of $F_{n+1}$ is $\ge m$, so $m$ is a minimum of $F_{n+1}$. If $a_{n+1} \le m$, then $a_{n+1} \in F_{n+1}$ and every $x \in F_n$ satisfies $a_{n+1} \le m \le x$ hence $a_{n+1} \le x$ by transitivity, so $a_{n+1}$ is a minimum of $F_{n+1}$. Either way $F_{n+1}$ has a minimum. [step 2.1, L1, L3]

4.1 Since $a_0, \dots, a_{n+1}$ were arbitrary, $F_{n+1}$ has a maximum and a minimum for every such list, that is, $P(n)$ implies $P(n+1)$. [step 3.1, step 3.2, A1]

5.1 The base case and the inductive step give $P(n)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ by the induction principle; since a nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is exactly a set of the form $F_n$, every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has both a maximum and a minimum. [step 1.1, step 4.1, given, L2, discharge-induction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the stipulation is discharged.** Finiteness itself is defined later, in [[def-countable]], as equinumerosity with a von Neumann natural; with that definition in hand [[lem-finite-subsets-listable]] proves that a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and finite exactly when it is listable as $\{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$, which is the Given below. So nothing on this page rests on an assumption that is never paid for; it is paid for later, and the payment is recorded in `justified_by`.
- **Only the total order is used, never completeness.** The base case needs reflexivity, the inductive step needs totality and transitivity, and the induction itself runs over $\mathbb{N}$. The same induction works in any totally ordered field; what is recorded here is its specialisation to $\mathbb{R}$.
- Nonemptiness is essential: $\emptyset$ is finite and has no maximum ([[def-max-min]]). Finiteness is essential too: $\{x \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < x < 1\}$ is bounded and has no maximum ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Combined with claim 1 of [[lem-max-is-sup]], this says every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has a supremum, and that the supremum is attained, because it equals the maximum. The infimum half is *not* part of [[lem-max-is-sup]], which speaks only of maxima and suprema; it follows from the minimum proved here together with the reflection identity $\inf X = -\sup(-X)$ ([[lem-reflection]], [[thm-infimum-property]]).

## Statement

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]) and let $(x_k)$ be a
sequence in $X$ converging to $p \in X$ ([[def-metric-convergence]]). Then
$(x_k)$ is Cauchy in $(X,d)$ ([[def-cauchy-in-metric]]).

The converse fails, and that failure is the subject of this page
([[fs-cauchy-implies-convergent-in-every-metric-space]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A metric space $(X,d)$, a sequence $(x_k)$ in $X$, a point $p \in X$ with $x_k \to p$, and a real $\varepsilon > 0$.

[A1] Convergence: for every real $\eta > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $d(x_k,p) < \eta$ for all $k \ge K$ ([[def-metric-convergence]], [[def-real-limit]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[A2] Cauchyness is established by producing, for every real $\varepsilon > 0$, an index $K$ with $d(x_m,x_n) < \varepsilon$ for all $m,n \ge K$ ([[def-cauchy-in-metric]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L1] Triangle inequality (M3) and symmetry (M2) of a metric ([[def-metric-space]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The real $\varepsilon/2$ is positive, so [A1] applied with $\eta = \varepsilon/2$ supplies $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $d(x_k, p) < \varepsilon/2$ for every $k \ge K$. [A1, algebra]

1.2 For all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ one has $d(x_m, x_n) \le d(x_m, p) + d(p, x_n)$. [L1]

2.1 Hence for all $m, n \ge K$: $d(x_m,x_n) \le d(x_m,p) + d(p,x_n) < \varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, algebra]

3.1 Since $\varepsilon > 0$ was an arbitrary real, $(x_k)$ is Cauchy in $(X,d)$. [step 2.1, A2] ∎

## Remarks

- **The proof spends the triangle inequality and symmetry, but not separation.** Symmetry rewrites $d(p,x_n)$ as the bounded quantity $d(x_n,p)$ in step 2.1. The separation axiom (M1) is not used, so the same argument shows that a sequence converging in a pseudometric space ([[def-metric-space]]) is Cauchy for the pseudometric.
- **Halving is the whole idea.** The Cauchy condition compares two terms of the sequence, and a limit compares one term with the limit; routing $m$ and $n$ through $p$ costs two applications of the convergence hypothesis, so each is run at half the target. Every proof on this page that produces a Cauchy sequence out of a convergent one repeats this step.

## Statement

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]) and let $(x_k)$ be a
sequence in $X$ ([[def-metric-convergence]]). If $x_k \to p$ and $x_k \to q$,
then $p = q$.

So a convergent sequence in a metric space has exactly one limit, and the
notation $\lim_k x_k$ is unambiguous.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A metric space $(X,d)$, a sequence $(x_k)$ in $X$, and points $p, q \in X$ with $x_k \to p$ and $x_k \to q$.

[A1] Convergence: $x_k \to p$ means that for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $d(x_k,p) < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$ ([[def-metric-convergence]], [[def-real-limit]]); and $d(x,y) \ge 0$ for all $x, y \in X$, so in particular $d(x_k,p) \ge 0$ and its absolute value is itself ([[lem-metric-nonnegativity]], [[def-abs-value]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L1] Density of the rationals: strictly between any two reals lies a rational, so below any real $\eta > 0$ there is a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L2] Halving. For a real $c > 0$ set $2 := 1 + 1$ and $c/2 := c \cdot 2^{-1}$. Then $2 > 0$, so $2 \ne 0$ and $2^{-1} > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]]); hence $c/2 > 0$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]); and $c/2 + c/2 = c(2^{-1} + 2^{-1}) = c(2 \cdot 2^{-1}) = c$ ([[def-field]]).

[L3] Separation (M1) and the triangle inequality (M3) of $d$, together with symmetry (M2) ([[def-metric-space]]).

[L4] Trichotomy of the order of $\mathbb{R}$, and transitivity: $a < b$ and $b \le a$ cannot both hold ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] Adding two inequalities: $a < b$ and $c < d$ give $a + c < b + d$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $p \ne q$. [assume-contra]

2.1 By (M1) $d(p,q) \ne 0$, and $d(p,q) \ge 0$, so $c := d(p,q) > 0$ by trichotomy; put $\eta := c/2$, a positive real with $\eta + \eta = c$. [step 1.1, A1, L2, L3, L4]

3.1 Fix a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, and use the convergence hypotheses at $\varepsilon$ to fix $K_1, K_2 \in \mathbb{N}$ with $d(x_k,p) < \varepsilon$ for $k \ge K_1$ and $d(x_k,q) < \varepsilon$ for $k \ge K_2$. [step 2.1, A1, L1, choose]

4.1 Let $m$ be any natural with $m \ge K_1$ and $m \ge K_2$, for instance $m := K_1 + K_2$; then $d(x_m,p) < \varepsilon$ and $d(x_m,q) < \varepsilon$. [step 3.1, choose]

5.1 By symmetry and the triangle inequality, $c = d(p,q) \le d(p,x_m) + d(x_m,q) = d(x_m,p) + d(x_m,q) < \varepsilon + \varepsilon < \eta + \eta = c$. [step 4.1, step 2.1, L3, L5]

6.1 Step 5.1 asserts $c < c$, which trichotomy forbids; the supposition of step 1.1 is therefore untenable and $p = q$. [step 5.1, L4, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where each axiom is spent.** Separation (M1) is what turns $p \ne q$ into $d(p,q) > 0$, and it is the only axiom that distinguishes a metric from a pseudometric ([[def-metric-space]]). In a pseudometric space with $d(p,q) = 0$ and $p \ne q$, the constant sequence $x_k = p$ converges to both, so the lemma is false there and this is exactly the step that fails.
- **The same argument proves more**, namely that a metric space is Hausdorff: the balls $B(p, c/2)$ and $B(q, c/2)$ are disjoint. That is recorded separately as [[thm-metric-hausdorff-separation]], and uniqueness of limits follows from it as well.
- **Instantiating at a rational is not cosmetic.** [[def-real-limit]] quantifies over rational $\varepsilon$, so a convergence hypothesis may only be applied at a rational; step 3.1 passes from the real $\eta$ to a rational below it using [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]], which is the sanctioned move.

## Statement

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$. A von Neumann natural is the set of its
predecessors, $n = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]), so it can be
used directly as an index set. Define

$$\mathbb{R}^n := \{\, x : x \text{ is a function } n \to \mathbb{R} \,\},$$

and write $x_k$ for $x(k)$, $k < n$. Two elements of $\mathbb{R}^n$ are equal
exactly when they agree at every $k < n$, functions being equal when they have
the same values. For $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ put

$$d_1(x,y) := \sum_{k<n} |x_k - y_k|, \qquad d_2(x,y) := \sqrt{\ \sum_{k<n} (x_k - y_k)^2\ }, \qquad d_\infty(x,y) := \max\{\, |x_k - y_k| : k < n \,\}.$$

All three are well defined: the finite sums are those of [[def-finite-sum]]; the
sum of squares is nonnegative ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[lem-of-square-positive]])
so it has a unique nonnegative square root ([[thm-of-square-roots]]); and
$\{|x_k - y_k| : k < n\}$ is a nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$, because
$n \ge 1$, so it has a maximum ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

**Then $d_1$, $d_2$ and $d_\infty$ are metrics on $\mathbb{R}^n$**
([[def-metric-space]]).

**Why $n \ge 1$.** For $n = 0$ the set $\mathbb{R}^0$ has exactly one element,
the empty function, and $d_1$ and $d_2$ are the empty sum $0$ and its root; but
$d_\infty$ would be the maximum of the empty set, which does not exist. The
hypothesis $n \ge 1$ is therefore not decoration, and it is carried by every
statement about $d_\infty$ in this library.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural $n \ge 1$; elements $x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}^n$; and the lists $a_k := x_k - y_k$, $b_k := y_k - z_k$ for $k < n$, so that $a_k + b_k = x_k - z_k$. Write $A := \sum_{k<n} a_k^2$, $C := \sum_{k<n} b_k^2$ and $B := \sum_{k<n} a_k b_k$.

[L1] Laws of finite sums ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[def-finite-sum]]): additivity, scaling, monotonicity; a sum of nonnegative terms is nonnegative, every single term is at most the sum, and a sum of nonnegative terms that vanishes has every term $0$.

[L2] Absolute value ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]]): $|u| \ge 0$; $|u| = 0$ if and only if $u = 0$; $|-u| = |u|$; and $u \le |u|$.

[L3] Two-term triangle inequality: $|u + v| \le |u| + |v|$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L4] Minkowski's inequality at the rational exponent $p = 1$ ([[thm-minkowski-finite]]): $\sum_{k<n}|a_k + b_k| \le \sum_{k<n}|a_k| + \sum_{k<n}|b_k|$.

[L5] Cauchy-Schwarz in root form ([[thm-cauchy-schwarz-finite]]): $\big|\sum_{k<n} a_k b_k\big| \le \sqrt{\sum_{k<n} a_k^2}\ \sqrt{\sum_{k<n} b_k^2}$.

[L6] Square roots ([[thm-of-square-roots]]): every $c \ge 0$ has a unique $\sqrt{c} \ge 0$ with $(\sqrt{c})^2 = c$; in particular $\sqrt{c} = 0$ if and only if $c = 0$.

[L7] Squares ([[lem-of-square-positive]], [[def-integer-power]]): $u^2 \ge 0$ always, and $u^2 = 0$ only for $u = 0$; and monotonicity of squaring on the nonnegatives, $s \le t \iff s^2 \le t^2$ for $s, t \ge 0$ ([[lem-of-square-monotone]]).

[L8] Maximum of a nonempty finite set of reals: it exists, it belongs to the set, and it is an upper bound of the set ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L9] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: inequalities may be added and a constant added to both sides, in the strict form of [[lem-of-add-order]] and, together with the case of equality settled by totality ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]), in the nonstrict form used below.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Separation for $d_1$: $d_1(x,y) = \sum_{k<n}|a_k|$ is a sum of nonnegative terms, so it vanishes exactly when every $|a_k|$ vanishes, that is exactly when $x_k = y_k$ for all $k < n$, that is exactly when $x = y$. [L1, L2]

1.2 Separation for $d_2$: $d_2(x,y) = \sqrt{A}$ vanishes exactly when $A = 0$; $A$ is a sum of nonnegative terms, so $A = 0$ exactly when $a_k^2 = 0$ for every $k < n$, which happens exactly when every $a_k = 0$, that is exactly when $x = y$. [L1, L6, L7]

1.3 Separation for $d_\infty$: the maximum $d_\infty(x,y)$ belongs to $\{|a_k| : k < n\}$ and bounds it above, so it is $0$ exactly when every $|a_k| = 0$, that is exactly when $x = y$. [L2, L8]

1.4 Symmetry for all three: $|y_k - x_k| = |-(x_k - y_k)| = |x_k - y_k|$ and $(y_k - x_k)^2 = (x_k - y_k)^2$ for every $k < n$, so the three defining expressions are unchanged when $x$ and $y$ are exchanged. [L2, L7]

1.5 Triangle inequality for $d_1$: applying [L4] to the lists $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ gives $d_1(x,z) = \sum_{k<n}|a_k + b_k| \le \sum_{k<n}|a_k| + \sum_{k<n}|b_k| = d_1(x,y) + d_1(y,z)$. [L4]

1.6 Expanding with additivity and scaling: $\sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k)^2 = \sum_{k<n}\big(a_k^2 + 2a_kb_k + b_k^2\big) = A + 2B + C$. [L1, algebra]

1.7 By [L5] and $B \le |B|$: $B \le \sqrt{A}\,\sqrt{C}$, and $A = (\sqrt{A})^2$, $C = (\sqrt{C})^2$ with $\sqrt{A}, \sqrt{C} \ge 0$. [L2, L5, L6]

1.8 Triangle inequality for $d_\infty$: for each $k < n$, $|a_k + b_k| \le |a_k| + |b_k| \le d_\infty(x,y) + d_\infty(y,z)$ because the two maxima bound their sets; so $d_\infty(x,y) + d_\infty(y,z)$ is an upper bound of $\{|a_k + b_k| : k < n\}$, and the maximum $d_\infty(x,z)$ of that set is one of its elements, whence $d_\infty(x,z) \le d_\infty(x,y) + d_\infty(y,z)$. [L3, L8, L9]

2.1 Combining steps 1.6 and 1.7: $\sum_{k<n}(a_k+b_k)^2 = A + 2B + C \le (\sqrt{A})^2 + 2\sqrt{A}\sqrt{C} + (\sqrt{C})^2 = \big(\sqrt{A} + \sqrt{C}\big)^2$. [step 1.6, step 1.7, L9, algebra]

3.1 Both $d_2(x,z) = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}(a_k+b_k)^2}$ and $\sqrt{A} + \sqrt{C}$ are nonnegative, and by step 2.1 the square of the first is at most the square of the second, so monotonicity of squaring on the nonnegatives gives $d_2(x,z) \le \sqrt{A} + \sqrt{C} = d_2(x,y) + d_2(y,z)$. [step 2.1, L6, L7]

4.1 Each of $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_\infty$ satisfies (M1) by steps 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3, satisfies (M2) by step 1.4, and satisfies (M3) by steps 1.5, 3.1 and 1.8 respectively; hence all three are metrics on $\mathbb{R}^n$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.8, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **$\mathbb{R}^n$ is defined ZFC-natively here**, as the set of functions from
  the von Neumann natural $n$ to $\mathbb{R}$, precisely so that its coordinates
  are indexed by $k < n$ and the finite-sum machinery of [[def-finite-sum]],
  [[thm-minkowski-finite]] and [[thm-cauchy-schwarz-finite]], all of which sum
  over $k < n$, applies without any reindexing.
- **No rational power appears anywhere above.** The triangle inequality for
  $d_2$ is obtained from Cauchy-Schwarz and the existence of square roots, not
  from Minkowski at $p = 2$, so this lemma does not depend on the theory of
  rational exponents. Minkowski is used only at $p = 1$, where its statement is
  the termwise sum of the two-term triangle inequality.
- **The three metrics are Lipschitz equivalent, with explicit constants,** and
  in particular have the same topology; that computation is on the companion
  page and is not needed here.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b \in F$.

1. If $a > 0$ then $a^{-1} > 0$.
2. If $0 < a < b$ then $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b \in F$.

[L1] $x > 0 \iff x \in P$; $x < 0 \iff -x \in P$; and for $x \neq 0$ exactly one of $x \in P$, $-x \in P$ holds ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Sign rules: a product of a positive and a negative is negative, a product of two positives is positive, and for $c > 0$ one has $a < b \iff ac < bc$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

[L3] $0 < 1$; in particular $1 \neq 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L4] $P$ is closed under addition, so $<$ is transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a > 0$, so $a \neq 0$ and its inverse $a^{-1}$ exists with $a \cdot a^{-1} = 1$; moreover $a^{-1} \neq 0$, since $a^{-1}$ has $a$ as its inverse while $0$ is non-invertible ($1 \neq 0$ by L3). [assume-hyp, L1, L3]

2.1 By trichotomy $a^{-1} \in P$ or $-a^{-1} \in P$; if $-a^{-1} \in P$, then $a > 0$ and $a^{-1} < 0$ give $a \cdot a^{-1} < 0$ by the sign rules, i.e. $1 < 0$, contradicting $0 < 1$; hence $a^{-1} \in P$, i.e. $a^{-1} > 0$, proving claim 1. [step 1.1, L2, L3, L1]

3.1 Assume $0 < a < b$; then $0 < b$ by transitivity, so by claim 1 both $a^{-1} > 0$ and $b^{-1} > 0$, and the sign rules give $a^{-1} b^{-1} > 0$. [assume-hyp, step 2.1, L4, L2, L1]

4.1 Multiplying $a < b$ by the positive $a^{-1} b^{-1}$ via the sign rules gives $a (a^{-1} b^{-1}) < b (a^{-1} b^{-1})$; since $a a^{-1} = 1$ and $b b^{-1} = 1$, this simplifies to $b^{-1} < a^{-1}$. [step 3.1, L2, algebra]

5.1 Together with $b^{-1} > 0$ from step 3.1, we conclude $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$, proving claim 2. [step 3.1, step 4.1] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field, with field structure as in [[def-field]], and for
$n \ge 1$ let $n \cdot 1_F$ denote the canonical natural number
$\underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$, defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$
and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$. Then for every $n \ge 1$:

- $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$;
- the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$;
- $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ and $(mn) \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F)$ for all $m, n \ge 1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ whose canonical naturals are defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, with $0 \cdot 1_F = 0$.

[L1] $0 < 1_F$ in every ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] The order is compatible with addition and positives are closed under addition: $a < b$ implies $a + c < b + c$, and $a > 0$, $b > 0$ imply $a + b > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 1$: by definition $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, and $1_F > 0$. [L1, base]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: assume $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for some fixed $n \ge 1$. [ih]

1.3 By the recursion, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F - n \cdot 1_F = 1_F > 0$, so $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$. [given, L1]

1.4 Additive identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ by the recursion, and if $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ then $(m+n+1) \cdot 1_F = (m+n) \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + (n+1) \cdot 1_F$. [given, algebra]

2.1 Inductive step: $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ is a sum of two positives, by the hypothesis and $1_F > 0$, hence $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Iterating 1.3, for $m < n$ one has $m \cdot 1_F < n \cdot 1_F$, so $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing and therefore injective on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$. [step 1.3, L2]

2.3 Multiplicative identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m \cdot 1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(1 \cdot 1_F)$, and the step $(m(n+1)) \cdot 1_F = (mn + m) \cdot 1_F = (mn) \cdot 1_F + m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F) + (m \cdot 1_F)(1_F) = (m \cdot 1_F)((n+1) \cdot 1_F)$ uses 1.4 and distributivity. [step 1.4, algebra]

3.1 By induction on 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for every $n \ge 1$; with the strict increase 2.2 and the identities 1.4, 2.3, every claim holds. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 1.4, step 2.3, discharge-induction] ∎

3. **The dictionary.** For $n \ge 1$ and all $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$,
   $$\lVert x-y\rVert_1 = d_1(x,y), \qquad \lVert x-y\rVert_2 = d_2(x,y), \qquad \lVert x-y\rVert_\infty = d_\infty(x,y),$$
   where $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_\infty$ are the metrics of the published
   [[lem-metrics-on-rn]]. So the metric induced by each of these three norms
   ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]) **is** the correspondingly named published
   metric, not merely one equivalent to it.

**Consequence, used repeatedly below and stated once here.** By clause 3 at
$p = 2$, the metric space $(\mathbb{R}^{n}, d_2)$ of the published metric-spaces
page and the metric space underlying the normed space
$(\mathbb{R}^{n}, \lVert\cdot\rVert_2)$ of this page are the same object. Hence
completeness ([[thm-euclidean-space-complete]] clause 2), Heine-Borel
([[thm-heine-borel-rn]] clause 2) and the compactness equivalences
([[thm-metric-compactness-equivalences]]) are statements about this page's normed
space, **with their hypothesis $n \ge 1$ inherited unchanged and not weakened**.
Nothing below cites any of those three theorems for $n = 0$.

**Why this lemma exists.** Without it the library would hold a norm-induced
metric on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and a separately published metric on the same set with
no recorded relation, and every later citation would have to guess which was
meant. The proof of clause 3 is a comparison of two written expressions; the
value is that the comparison is made and recorded.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural number $n$, a rational $p \ge 1$, vectors $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ and a real $\lambda$; write $S(x) := \sum_{k<n}|x_k|^{p}$, so that $\lVert x\rVert_p = S(x)^{1/p}$ ([[def-p-norms-on-rn]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[A1] For clauses 2 and 3, $n \ge 1$, so that $\{|x_k| : k<n\}$ is a nonempty finite set of reals ([[def-p-norms-on-rn]], [[lem-metrics-on-rn]]).

[L1] Rational powers ([[def-rational-power]], [[lem-rational-power-laws]]): for $a, b \ge 0$ and rationals $r, s > 0$ one has $a^{r} \ge 0$, $(ab)^{r} = a^{r}b^{r}$, $0^{r} = 0$, and $a^{r} > 0$ when $a > 0$; and for $a > 0$, $(a^{r})^{s} = a^{rs}$ and $a^{1} = a$.

[L2] Monotonicity in the base ([[lem-rational-power-monotone]] clause 2): for a rational $r > 0$ and reals $0 \le a < b$ one has $a^{r} < b^{r}$; hence $a \le b$ implies $a^{r} \le b^{r}$, the case $a = b$ being trivial, and $a^{r} = 0$ only for $a = 0$.

[L3] Laws of finite sums ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[def-finite-sum]]): additivity, scaling, monotonicity; a sum of nonnegative terms is nonnegative, each single term is at most such a sum, and a sum of nonnegative terms that vanishes has every term $0$.

[L4] Minkowski's inequality for finite sums at rational $p \ge 1$ ([[thm-minkowski-finite]]): $\bigl(\sum_{k<n}|a_k+b_k|^{p}\bigr)^{1/p} \le \bigl(\sum_{k<n}|a_k|^{p}\bigr)^{1/p} + \bigl(\sum_{k<n}|b_k|^{p}\bigr)^{1/p}$.

[L5] Absolute value ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]], [[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]): $|t| \ge 0$; $|t| = 0$ exactly when $t = 0$; $|st| = |s|\,|t|$; $|s+t| \le |s|+|t|$; and $|t|^{2} = t^{2}$.

[L6] Maxima ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]): a nonempty finite set of reals has a maximum, the maximum belongs to the set and bounds it above, and a set with an upper bound belonging to it has that element as its maximum.

[L7] Order arithmetic: multiplying an inequality by a nonnegative real preserves it ([[lem-of-sign-rules]] in its strict form, together with the case of equality settled by totality), and $\le$ is transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L8] The norm axioms (N1), (N2), (N3) ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]); $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ agrees with the Euclidean norm of [[def-euclidean-inner-product]], and is a norm by [[thm-cauchy-schwarz-and-the-euclidean-norm]]; square roots are the rational power at exponent $1/2$ ([[thm-of-square-roots]], [[def-p-norms-on-rn]]).

[L9] The published metrics on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n \ge 1$ are $d_1(x,y) = \sum_{k<n}|x_k-y_k|$, $d_2(x,y) = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}(x_k-y_k)^{2}}$ and $d_\infty(x,y) = \max\{|x_k-y_k| : k<n\}$, and each is a metric ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]], [[def-metric-space]], [[def-metric-topology]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Every term $|x_k|^{p}$ is nonnegative, so $S(x) \ge 0$ and $\lVert x\rVert_p = S(x)^{1/p}$ is defined and nonnegative. [L1, L3]

1.2 $S(x) = 0$ holds exactly when $|x_k|^{p} = 0$ for every $k<n$, a vanishing sum of nonnegative terms having every term $0$; and $|x_k|^{p} = 0$ exactly when $|x_k| = 0$, that is exactly when $x_k = 0$. [L1, L2, L3, L5]

1.3 For every $k<n$, $|(\lambda x)_k|^{p} = \bigl(|\lambda|\,|x_k|\bigr)^{p} = |\lambda|^{p}|x_k|^{p}$, so $S(\lambda x) = |\lambda|^{p}S(x)$ by scaling of finite sums. [L1, L3, L5]

1.4 Instantiating [L4] at $a_k := x_k$ and $b_k := y_k$, and using $(x+y)_k = x_k+y_k$, gives $\lVert x+y\rVert_p \le \lVert x\rVert_p + \lVert y\rVert_p$, which is axiom (N3) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$. [L4, L8]

1.5 Under [A1] the set $\{|x_k| : k<n\}$ is nonempty and finite, so $\lVert x\rVert_\infty$ exists, is one of the $|x_k|$, and satisfies $|x_k| \le \lVert x\rVert_\infty$ for every $k<n$; in particular $\lVert x\rVert_\infty \ge 0$. [A1, L5, L6]

1.6 Under [A1], $\lVert x-y\rVert_1 = \sum_{k<n}|x_k-y_k|$ by the case $p=1$ of the definition, and that is the written expression for $d_1(x,y)$. [L1, L9]

1.7 Under [A1], $\lVert x-y\rVert_2 = \bigl(\sum_{k<n}|x_k-y_k|^{2}\bigr)^{1/2} = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}(x_k-y_k)^{2}}$, using $|t|^{2} = t^{2}$ and the identification of the exponent $1/2$ with the nonnegative square root, and that is the written expression for $d_2(x,y)$. [L5, L8, L9]

1.8 Under [A1], $\lVert x-y\rVert_\infty = \max\{|x_k-y_k| : k<n\}$ by definition, and that is the written expression for $d_\infty(x,y)$. [L9]

2.1 $\lVert x\rVert_p = 0$ holds exactly when $S(x) = 0$, since $S(x) > 0$ would give $S(x)^{1/p} > 0$ and $0^{1/p} = 0$. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.2 Under [A1]: $\lVert x\rVert_\infty = 0$ forces $|x_k| \le 0$ and $|x_k| \ge 0$ for every $k<n$, hence $x = 0$; and $\lVert 0\rVert_\infty = 0$. This is (N1) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$. [step 1.5, L5, L8]

2.3 Under [A1]: for every $k<n$, $|(\lambda x)_k| = |\lambda|\,|x_k| \le |\lambda|\,\lVert x\rVert_\infty$, and choosing $j<n$ with $|x_j| = \lVert x\rVert_\infty$ gives $|(\lambda x)_j| = |\lambda|\,\lVert x\rVert_\infty$; so $|\lambda|\lVert x\rVert_\infty$ belongs to the set and bounds it above, whence $\lVert \lambda x\rVert_\infty = |\lambda|\lVert x\rVert_\infty$. This is (N2) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$. [step 1.5, L5, L6, L7]

2.4 Under [A1]: for every $k<n$, $|(x+y)_k| = |x_k+y_k| \le |x_k| + |y_k| \le \lVert x\rVert_\infty + \lVert y\rVert_\infty$; choosing $j<n$ with $|(x+y)_j| = \lVert x+y\rVert_\infty$ gives $\lVert x+y\rVert_\infty \le \lVert x\rVert_\infty + \lVert y\rVert_\infty$, which is (N3) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$. [step 1.5, L5, L6, L7]

3.1 By steps 2.1 and 1.2, $\lVert x\rVert_p = 0$ exactly when $x_k = 0$ for every $k<n$, that is exactly when $x = 0$; this is axiom (N1) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$. [step 2.1, step 1.2, L8]

3.2 Steps 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 are (N1), (N2) and (N3) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ under [A1], so clause 2 holds. [step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, A1, L8]

4.1 If $\lambda = 0$ then $\lambda x = 0$ and both sides of (N2) are $0$ by step 3.1; if $\lambda \ne 0$ then $|\lambda| > 0$, and step 1.3 with the power laws gives $\lVert \lambda x\rVert_p = \bigl(|\lambda|^{p}S(x)\bigr)^{1/p} = \bigl(|\lambda|^{p}\bigr)^{1/p}S(x)^{1/p} = |\lambda|^{p\cdot(1/p)}\lVert x\rVert_p = |\lambda|\,\lVert x\rVert_p$; this is axiom (N2). [step 1.3, step 3.1, L1, L5, L8]

5.1 Steps 3.1, 4.1 and 1.4 are (N1), (N2) and (N3) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$, so clause 1 holds. [step 1.4, step 3.1, step 4.1, L8]

6.1 Steps 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8 give clause 3, and with steps 5.1 and 3.2 all three clauses are proved; in particular the metric induced by $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n \ge 1$ is the published $d_2$, which is the consequence recorded in the Statement. [step 5.1, step 3.2, step 1.6, step 1.7, step 1.8, L9] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the consequence does and does not license.** Because the two metric spaces are literally the same, a published theorem about $(\mathbb{R}^{n}, d_2)$ may be quoted here verbatim. It may **not** be quoted with a weaker hypothesis: [[thm-euclidean-space-complete]], [[thm-heine-borel-rn]] and [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] are all stated for $n \ge 1$ only, because $d_\infty$ is a maximum over an empty index set at $n = 0$, and every item on this page that uses one of them carries $n \ge 1$ in its own statement.

- **Clause 1 holds at $n = 0$ and clause 2 does not apply there.** At $n = 0$ every $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$ is the zero function on the one-element space $\mathbb{R}^{0}$, which is the unique norm on the zero space ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]); $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ is not defined there at all.

- **The route to (N3) differs between the two families, and that is not an accident.** For $\lVert\cdot\rVert_p$ the triangle inequality is Minkowski's inequality, a genuine theorem about rational powers; for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ it is the elementary argument of step 2.4, that a maximum of sums is at most the sum of the maxima. The second argument is the one that needs a nonempty index set.

## Statement

Define $d_{\mathbb{R}} : \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ by
$d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) := |x - y|$ ([[def-abs-value]]). Then:

1. $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ is a metric on $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-metric-space]]); it is
   called the **usual metric** of $\mathbb{R}$.
2. For $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and $r > 0$ the open ball is the bounded open interval
   ([[def-interval]], [[def-metric-ball]])
   $$B(x,r) = (x-r,\ x+r),$$
   and the closed ball is $\bar B(x,r) = [x-r,\ x+r]$.
3. Consequently $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is open in the metric topology of
   $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-metric-topology]]) exactly when for every $x \in U$
   there is $r > 0$ with $(x-r, x+r) \subseteq U$. This topology is called the
   **usual topology** of $\mathbb{R}$.
4. $(\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$ is not a bounded metric space
   ([[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]): no ball contains $\mathbb{R}$, so
   $\operatorname{diam}(\mathbb{R})$ is not defined.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The complete ordered field $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]), and the function $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) = |x-y|$; points $x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}$ and a real $r > 0$.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| \ge 0$; $|u| = 0$ if and only if $u = 0$; $|-u| = |u|$; and for $c > 0$ one has $|u| < c$ if and only if $-c < u < c$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Triangle inequality in an ordered field: $|u + v| \le |u| + |v|$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L3] Intervals: $(a,b) = \{t : a < t < b\}$ and $[a,b] = \{t : a \le t \le b\}$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L4] Archimedean property: for every $w \in \mathbb{R}$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $w < n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); and $n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L5] Adding a constant to an inequality, in strict and nonstrict form: the strict form is [[lem-of-add-order]] and the nonstrict form is that together with the case of equality, the order being total ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L6] Trichotomy: for reals $a,b$ exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Separation (M1): $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) = |x-y| = 0$ holds if and only if $x - y = 0$, that is if and only if $x = y$. [L1]

1.2 Symmetry (M2): $d_{\mathbb{R}}(y,x) = |y-x| = |-(x-y)| = |x-y| = d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y)$. [L1]

1.3 Triangle inequality (M3): $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,z) = |x - z| = |(x-y) + (y-z)| \le |x-y| + |y-z| = d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) + d_{\mathbb{R}}(y,z)$. [L2]

1.4 For $y \in \mathbb{R}$ and $r > 0$: $y \in B(x,r)$ means $|x - y| < r$, which by [L1] holds if and only if $-r < x - y < r$, and adding $y - r$ respectively $y + r$ to the two halves shows this is equivalent to $x - r < y < x + r$. [L1, L5]

1.5 For $y \in \mathbb{R}$ and $r > 0$: $y \in \bar B(x,r)$ means $|x-y| \le r$, which by the same equivalence read with $\le$ in place of $<$ holds if and only if $x - r \le y \le x + r$. [L1, L5]

1.6 Let $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ and $r > 0$ be arbitrary, and use [L4] to fix a natural $n \ge 1$ with $x_0 + r < n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$; write $w := n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$. [L4, choose]

2.1 By steps 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 the function $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ satisfies (M1), (M2) and (M3), so it is a metric on $\mathbb{R}$, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3]

2.2 By step 1.4 and [L3] the set $B(x,r)$ has exactly the elements of $(x-r,x+r)$, and by step 1.5 and [L3] the set $\bar B(x,r)$ has exactly the elements of $[x-r,x+r]$; this is claim 2. [step 1.4, step 1.5, L3]

2.3 Since $r > 0$ we have $x_0 < x_0 + r < w$, so $w - x_0 > r > 0$ and hence $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x_0, w) = |x_0 - w| = |-(w - x_0)| = w - x_0 > r$; therefore $w \notin B(x_0,r)$. [step 1.6, L1, L5, L6]

3.1 Substituting claim 2 into the definition of open in the metric topology gives claim 3: $U$ is open exactly when every $x \in U$ admits $r > 0$ with $(x-r,x+r) = B(x,r) \subseteq U$. [step 2.2]

4.1 Since $x_0$ and $r$ were arbitrary, step 2.3 exhibits for every ball $B(x_0,r)$ a real not in it, so no ball contains $\mathbb{R}$; hence $\mathbb{R}$ is not a bounded subset of itself and $\operatorname{diam}(\mathbb{R})$ is not defined, which is claim 4. [step 2.1, step 2.3] ∎

## Remarks

- **This is the metric every later ceiling rests on.** Every real-line example on the companion page, and every subspace of $\mathbb{R}$ used there, takes its metric from $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ through the subspace construction of [[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]].
- **Unboundedness needs no Archimedean input, and no completeness either.** No ordered field is bounded under $d(u,v) = |u-v|$, and the reason is a single element rather than any cofinality property: given a centre $c$ and a radius $r > 0$, the element $c + r + 1$ satisfies $d(c,\, c + r + 1) = |{-(r+1)}| = r + 1 > r$, because $1 > 0$ and $r + 1 > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]]); so it lies outside $B(c,r)$ and no ball contains the field. Step 1.6 above chooses its witness with [[thm-of-archimedean]] instead, which is a convenience and not a necessity: it delivers a witness that is a canonical natural, and claim 4 needs no such thing. Claim 4 therefore holds verbatim in every ordered field with this $d$, Archimedean or not. Note also that a radius is an element of $\mathbb{R}$, so "a ball of infinite radius" is not something that can be written here.
- **The claim that $\operatorname{diam}(\mathbb{R})$ is "not defined" is a claim about the conventions of this development** ([[rem-sup-conventions]], [[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]): suprema here are real numbers and the extended real line, which is introduced on a later page, is not used for them, so an unbounded set has no diameter at all rather than a diameter $+\infty$.

## Statement

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]), let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $F^{n}$ be the
function space on the von Neumann natural $n = \{0, \dots, n-1\}$, with the
pointwise operations ([[def-function-space]], [[def-natural-numbers]],
[[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]). For $i < n$ define the **standard unit vector**
$e_i \in F^{n}$ by

$$e_i(i) = 1_F, \qquad e_i(j) = 0_F \ \text{ for } j < n \text{ with } j \ne i .$$

Then:

1. **Finite sums in a function space are pointwise.** For every set $X$, every
   $p \in \mathbb{N}$, every list $u : p \to F^{X}$ and every $j \in X$,
   $$\Bigl(\sum_{k<p} u_k\Bigr)(j) \;=\; \sum_{k<p} u_k(j),$$
   the right-hand sum being taken in $(F,+,0_F)$. (Stated here for an arbitrary
   $X$ because the companion page needs it at $X = \mathbb{N}$.)
2. $e : n \to F^{n}$ is an ordered basis of $F^{n}$ ([[def-linear-basis]]); in
   particular $e$ is injective and its image $e[n] = \{\, e_i : i < n \,\}$ is a
   basis of $F^{n}$ with $e[n] \approx n$ ([[def-equinumerous]]);
3. for every $\lambda : n \to F$ and every $j < n$,
   $\bigl(\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i e_i\bigr)(j) = \lambda_j$; equivalently the
   coordinate list of $x \in F^{n}$ with respect to the ordered basis $e$
   ([[thm-unique-coordinates-with-respect-to-an-ordered-basis]]) is
   $i \mapsto x(i)$;
4. $F^{n}$ is finite-dimensional over $F$ with $\dim_F F^{n} = n$
   ([[def-dimension]]);
5. at $n = 0$ this reads: $F^{0}$ has exactly one element, the empty function,
   so $F^{0}$ is the zero space, the empty list is its ordered basis,
   $\varnothing$ is its basis and $\dim_F F^{0} = 0$.

Every index runs from $0$, so the coordinates of an element of $F^{n}$ are
$x_0, \dots, x_{n-1}$ and no statement above is restricted to $n \ge 1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A field $F$, a natural number $n$, the vector space $F^{n}$ with pointwise operations, and the vectors $e_i$ for $i < n$.

[L1] $F^{X}$ is a vector space over $F$ with $(x+y)(j) = x(j)+y(j)$, $(\lambda x)(j) = \lambda\,x(j)$ and zero the constant function at $0_F$; two elements are equal exactly when they agree at every point; and $F^{0}$ has exactly one element, the empty function, which is $0_{F^{0}}$ ([[def-function-space]], [[def-vector-space]]).

[L2] Finite sums: $\sum_{k<0}u_k$ is the zero vector and $\sum_{k<\sigma(p)}u_k = \bigl(\sum_{k<p}u_k\bigr) + u_p$, in any vector space ([[def-monoid-finite-product]], [[def-linear-combination-and-span]]).

[L3] $F$ is a vector space over itself, with the field addition and multiplication ([[lem-restriction-of-scalars]], claim 1), so the finite sums of $\mathbb{N}$-indexed lists of scalars are available in $(F,+,0_F)$ and satisfy (F1) and (F3); in particular a list of scalars vanishing off a single index sums to its value at that index ([[def-sum-of-linear-subspaces]]).

[L4] In $F$: $\lambda 1_F = \lambda$ and $\lambda 0_F = 0_F$ for every $\lambda \in F$ ([[def-field]], [[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]]).

[L5] A list $v : n \to V$ is an ordered basis of $V$ if and only if every $x \in V$ is $\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i v_i$ for exactly one $\lambda : n \to F$; an ordered basis is injective and its image is a basis with $v[n] \approx n$ ([[thm-unique-coordinates-with-respect-to-an-ordered-basis]], [[def-linear-basis]], [[def-linear-independence]], [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L6] $\dim_F V$ is the unique $p \in \mathbb{N}$ with a basis $B \approx p$, defined when $V$ has a finite basis ([[def-dimension]], [[def-countable]]).

[L7] Induction on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Claim 1, that a finite sum in $F^{X}$ is computed pointwise: for every $p \in \mathbb{N}$, every list $u : p \to F^{X}$ and every $j \in X$, $\bigl(\sum_{k<p}u_k\bigr)(j) = \sum_{k<p}u_k(j)$, the right-hand sum being taken in $(F,+,0_F)$. By induction on $p$: at $p = 0$ the left side is the value at $j$ of the constant function $0_F$ and the right side is the empty sum $0_F$; and if it holds at $p$, then $\bigl(\sum_{k<\sigma(p)}u_k\bigr)(j) = \bigl(\sum_{k<p}u_k + u_p\bigr)(j) = \bigl(\sum_{k<p}u_k\bigr)(j) + u_p(j) = \sum_{k<p}u_k(j) + u_p(j) = \sum_{k<\sigma(p)}u_k(j)$, using pointwise addition and the recursion. [L1, L2, L3, L7]

2.1 Evaluating a combination of the $e_i$. Let $\lambda : n \to F$ and $j < n$. By step 1.1 and pointwise scalar multiplication, $\bigl(\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i e_i\bigr)(j) = \sum_{i<n}(\lambda_i e_i)(j) = \sum_{i<n}\lambda_i\, e_i(j)$. The list of scalars $i \mapsto \lambda_i\,e_i(j)$ takes the value $\lambda_i 0_F = 0_F$ at every $i \ne j$ and the value $\lambda_j 1_F = \lambda_j$ at $i = j$, so it vanishes off the single index $j$ and therefore sums to $\lambda_j$. Hence $\bigl(\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i e_i\bigr)(j) = \lambda_j$ for every $j < n$. [step 1.1, L1, L3, L4]

3.1 Existence and uniqueness of coordinates. Given $x \in F^{n}$, put $\lambda_i := x(i)$; by step 2.1 the vectors $\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i e_i$ and $x$ agree at every $j < n$, hence are equal. And if $\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i e_i = \sum_{i<n}\mu_i e_i$, then evaluating both sides at $j$ and using step 2.1 gives $\lambda_j = \mu_j$ for every $j < n$. So every $x \in F^{n}$ is $\sum_{i<n}\lambda_i e_i$ for exactly one $\lambda : n \to F$. [step 2.1, L1]

4.1 Claims 2 and 3. Step 2.1 is claim 3, and by the coordinate characterisation of an ordered basis, step 3.1 says exactly that $e$ is an ordered basis of $F^{n}$; hence $e$ is injective, $e[n]$ is a basis of $F^{n}$, and $e[n] \approx n$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L5]

5.1 Claims 4 and 5. By step 4.1 the space $F^{n}$ has a basis with $n$ elements, so it is finite-dimensional and $\dim_F F^{n} = n$. At $n = 0$ the space $F^{0}$ has exactly one element, the empty function, which is its zero vector, so $F^{0}$ is the zero space; the list $e$ is then the empty list, its image is $\varnothing$, and $\dim_F F^{0} = 0$. [step 4.1, L1, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- **The indices start at $0$ because a natural number is the set of its predecessors.** $F^{n}$ is the function space $F^{X}$ at $X = n = \{0,\dots,n-1\}$ ([[def-function-space]], [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]), so an element of $F^{n}$ is a function on $\{0,\dots,n-1\}$ and there is no $e_n$. Reading the standard basis off a $1$-indexed source would put a vector outside the space at one end and lose one at the other.

- **Step 1.1 is not a triviality to be skipped.** That a finite sum of functions is the pointwise finite sum is a statement about the recursion defining [[def-monoid-finite-product]] in two different monoids, and it is proved by induction. Every evaluation argument on this page and on the companion page rests on it.

- **This is the concrete counterweight to [[cor-every-vector-space-has-a-basis]].** Here a basis is written down and no choice principle is used anywhere; there a basis is produced by Zorn's lemma and none is exhibited. The companion page carries both extremes for infinite-dimensional spaces as well: an explicit infinite basis for the eventually zero families, and a basis of $\mathbb{R}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ that no argument exhibits.

## Statement

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$. Then any two norms on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are
equivalent ([[def-equivalent-norms]], [[def-norm-and-normed-space]]).

More precisely, for every norm $N$ on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ there are reals
$c > 0$ and $C' > 0$ with

$$c\,\lVert x\rVert_2 \;\le\; N(x) \;\le\; C'\,\lVert x\rVert_2 \qquad \text{for every } x \in \mathbb{R}^{n},$$

and the general statement follows because equivalence of norms is an equivalence
relation.

**Consequently all the metric notions on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are norm independent**
for $n \ge 1$: any two norms give the same open sets, the same convergent
sequences with the same limits, the same Cauchy sequences and the same uniformly
continuous maps ([[def-equivalent-norms]]).

**The hypothesis $n \ge 1$ is used twice in the proof and both uses are marked**:
once so that the constant $C$ of
[[lem-every-norm-on-rn-is-continuous-for-the-euclidean-metric]] exists, and once
so that the Euclidean unit sphere is **nonempty**, which is what the extreme
value theorem needs. At $n = 0$ the conclusion is true but vacuous, the zero
space carrying exactly one norm ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]), and it is not
obtained from the argument below.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural $n \ge 1$, the space $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with the norms of [[def-p-norms-on-rn]] and the published metric $d_2$ ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]], [[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]]), and a norm $N$ on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$; write $S := \{\, x \in \mathbb{R}^{n} : \lVert x\rVert_2 = 1 \,\}$.

[L1] For $n \ge 1$: $C := \max\{N(e_k) : k<n\}$ exists with $C \ge 0$, $N(x) \le C\lVert x\rVert_1$, $\lVert x\rVert_1 \le \sqrt{\iota(n)}\lVert x\rVert_2$, and $N$ is continuous as a map $(\mathbb{R}^{n}, d_2) \to (\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$ ([[lem-every-norm-on-rn-is-continuous-for-the-euclidean-metric]] clauses 2, 3, 4).

[L2] Equivalence of norms is an equivalence relation, and $c M \le N \le C M$ with $c, C > 0$ is what it means ([[def-equivalent-norms]]).

[L3] Heine-Borel in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n \ge 1$: a subset of $(\mathbb{R}^{n},d_2)$ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded ([[thm-heine-borel-rn]] clause 2, [[def-metric-compactness]], [[def-metric-topology]], [[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]).

[L4] Extreme value theorem: a continuous real-valued function on a **nonempty** compact metric space attains a least value ([[thm-extreme-value-metric]]).

[L5] Continuity characterisations: a map of metric spaces continuous at every point has closed preimages of closed sets ([[thm-metric-continuity-characterisations]], clause (c)).

[L6] Balls, openness and boundedness ([[def-metric-ball]], [[def-metric-topology]], [[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]): $U$ is open when every point of $U$ has a ball inside $U$; $A$ is bounded when $A = \emptyset$ or $A \subseteq B(x_0,r)$ for some $x_0$ and real $r>0$.

[L7] The norm axioms (N1) and (N2), and nonnegativity of a norm ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]).

[L8] The standard basis vector $e_0 \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ exists for $n \ge 1$, with $e_0(0) = 1$ and $e_0(j) = 0$ for $0 \ne j < n$ ([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]]); hence $\lVert e_0\rVert_2 = \sqrt{1} = 1$ ([[def-p-norms-on-rn]], [[thm-of-square-roots]]).

[L9] Inverses: $u > 0$ gives $u^{-1} > 0$, and trichotomy of the order of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L10] Continuity at a point in the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ form, and the metric subspace $(A, d_A)$ with $d_A$ the restriction of $d$ ([[def-metric-continuity]], [[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]], [[def-metric-compactness]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The singleton $\{1\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is closed: if $y \ne 1$ then $r := |y-1| > 0$ and the ball $B(y,r)$ omits $1$, so the complement of $\{1\}$ is open. [L6, L9]

1.2 $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ is itself a norm on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, so by [L1] applied to it, $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2 : (\mathbb{R}^{n},d_2) \to (\mathbb{R},d_{\mathbb{R}})$ is continuous. [L1, L7]

1.3 $S \subseteq B(0,2)$, since $x \in S$ gives $d_2(x,0) = \lVert x\rVert_2 = 1 < 2$; so $S$ is bounded. [L6, L7]

1.4 $e_0 \in S$, because $\lVert e_0\rVert_2 = 1$; this is where $n \ge 1$ is used, since for $n = 0$ there is no index $0 < n$ and no such vector. So $S \ne \emptyset$. [L8]

1.5 For every $a \in S$ and every real $\varepsilon > 0$, a $\delta > 0$ witnessing continuity of $N$ at $a$ as a map on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ also witnesses it for the restriction $N|_S$ on the metric subspace $(S, d_S)$, because $d_S$ is the restriction of $d_2$ and the condition is quantified over fewer points; so $N|_S$ is continuous. [L1, L10]

1.6 Put $C' := C\sqrt{\iota(n)} + 1$, a real $> 0$. By [L1], $N(x) \le C\lVert x\rVert_1 \le C\sqrt{\iota(n)}\lVert x\rVert_2 \le C'\lVert x\rVert_2$, the last step because $\lVert x\rVert_2 \ge 0$. [L1, L7]

2.1 $S$ is the preimage of $\{1\}$ under the continuous $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$, hence closed in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L5]

3.1 $S$ is a compact subset of $(\mathbb{R}^{n},d_2)$, being closed and bounded. [step 1.3, step 2.1, L3]

4.1 By the extreme value theorem applied to the nonempty compact metric space $(S,d_S)$ and the continuous $N|_S$, there is $x_{\min} \in S$ with $N(x_{\min}) \le N(x)$ for every $x \in S$; put $c := N(x_{\min})$. [step 1.4, step 1.5, step 3.1, L4]

5.1 $c > 0$: from $x_{\min} \in S$ we get $\lVert x_{\min}\rVert_2 = 1 \ne 0$, so $x_{\min} \ne 0$ by (N1) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$, so $N(x_{\min}) \ne 0$ by (N1) for $N$, and $N(x_{\min}) \ge 0$; trichotomy leaves $c > 0$. [step 4.1, L7, L9]

5.2 Let $x \ne 0$. Then $\lVert x\rVert_2 > 0$ by (N1) and nonnegativity, so $t := 1/\lVert x\rVert_2 > 0$ and $u := t\,x$ satisfies $\lVert u\rVert_2 = |t|\,\lVert x\rVert_2 = 1$ by (N2); hence $u \in S$ and $c \le N(u) = |t|\,N(x) = N(x)/\lVert x\rVert_2$, that is $c\,\lVert x\rVert_2 \le N(x)$. [step 4.1, L7, L9]

6.1 For $x = 0$ both $c\lVert x\rVert_2$ and $N(x)$ are $0$ by (N1), so $c\lVert x\rVert_2 \le N(x)$ holds for every $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$. [step 5.2, L7]

7.1 Steps 5.1, 6.1 and 1.6 give $c\lVert x\rVert_2 \le N(x) \le C'\lVert x\rVert_2$ with $c, C' > 0$, so every norm $N$ on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is equivalent to $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$. [step 5.1, step 6.1, step 1.6, L2]

8.1 Given two norms $M$ and $N$ on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, each is equivalent to $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ by step 7.1, so $M$ is equivalent to $N$ by symmetry and transitivity of the relation. [step 7.1, L2] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the proof spends, and where it stops.** The only nonelementary ingredients are compactness of the Euclidean unit sphere, obtained from [[thm-heine-borel-rn]], and the extreme value theorem [[thm-extreme-value-metric]]. Heine-Borel in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is proved by bisection and uses no choice principle, and the extreme value theorem is a theorem of ZF ([[rem-compactness-choice-ledger-metric]]), so this theorem costs no choice either.

- **The sphere is where the argument is finite-dimensional.** The step that fails outside $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is step 3.1: closed and bounded gives compact by [[thm-heine-borel-rn]], a theorem about $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for a natural $n$ and about nothing else. The companion page exhibits a real vector space carrying two inequivalent norms, and the same space with a closed bounded set that is not compact. **This remark is a statement about this proof and about that witness; no claim is made here about normed spaces in general, a theory this library has not built.**

- **The constants are not canonical.** Nothing in the statement fixes $c$ or $C'$, and the proof produces one admissible pair, not the best one. Sharp constants for the three named norms on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ are computed on the companion page.

## Statement

1. $(\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$ with the usual metric $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) = |x-y|$
   ([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]) is a complete metric space
   ([[def-complete-metric-space]]).
2. Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$ and let $d_2$ be the Euclidean metric on
   $\mathbb{R}^n$ ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]]). Then $(\mathbb{R}^n, d_2)$ is complete.

**The hypothesis $n \ge 1$ is inherited and is not decoration.**
[[lem-metrics-on-rn]] defines $\mathbb{R}^n$ and its three metrics only for
$n \ge 1$, because at $n = 0$ the metric $d_\infty$ would be a maximum over the
empty index set. Every statement about $\mathbb{R}^n$ in this library carries the
hypothesis, and this one does too.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural $n \ge 1$; $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the set of functions $n \to \mathbb{R}$ with $d_2(x,y) = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}(x_k-y_k)^2}$; a real $\varepsilon > 0$.

[A1] Cauchy criterion in $\mathbb{R}$: every Cauchy sequence of reals converges to a real ([[thm-cauchy-criterion-via-lub]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L1] The usual metric of $\mathbb{R}$ is $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) = |x-y|$ ([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]).

[L2] Convergence in a metric space: $x_k \to p$ in $(X,d)$ means $d(x_k,p) \to 0$ in $\mathbb{R}$; Cauchyness means $d(x_m,x_n) < \varepsilon$ for $m,n$ beyond an index ([[def-metric-convergence]], [[def-cauchy-in-metric]], [[def-metric-space]]).

[L3] $d_2$ is a metric on $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n \ge 1$, its defining sum is a finite sum, and the sum of squares is nonnegative with a unique nonnegative square root ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]], [[def-finite-sum]], [[thm-of-square-roots]]).

[L4] Finite sums of nonnegative terms dominate each term and are monotone, and $\sum_{k<n} \lambda = n\lambda$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], claims 2 and 4).

[L5] For $a, b \ge 0$: $a \le b \iff a^2 \le b^2$ and $a < b \iff a^2 < b^2$ ([[lem-of-square-monotone]]); and $|t|^2 = t^2$ for every real $t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L6] A nonempty finite set of naturals has a maximum, and every nonempty set of naturals has a least element ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]], [[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L7] $n \ge 1$ gives $0 < 1/n \le 1$ and $0 < \varepsilon/(2n)$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

[L8] Limits of real sequences are unique, which is what licenses writing $\lim_k x_k$ for a sequence already known to converge ([[lem-limit-unique]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L1] a sequence $(x_k)$ of reals is Cauchy in $(\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$ exactly when $|x_m - x_n| < \varepsilon$ for all $m,n$ beyond an index and every rational $\varepsilon > 0$, which is verbatim the Cauchy condition of [[def-real-limit]]; and $x_k \to p$ in $(\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$ exactly when $|x_k - p| \to 0$, which is verbatim convergence to $p$ there. [L1, L2]

1.2 Let $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $j < n$. The terms $(x_k - y_k)^2$ are nonnegative, so $(x_j - y_j)^2 \le \sum_{k<n}(x_k-y_k)^2 = d_2(x,y)^2$; both $|x_j - y_j|$ and $d_2(x,y)$ are nonnegative and $|x_j-y_j|^2 = (x_j-y_j)^2$, so $|x_j - y_j| \le d_2(x,y)$. [L3, L4, L5]

1.3 Let $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ satisfy $|x_j - y_j| < \varepsilon/(2n)$ for every $j < n$. Then $(x_j-y_j)^2 \le (\varepsilon/(2n))^2$ for every $j < n$, so $d_2(x,y)^2 \le n \cdot \varepsilon^2/(4n^2) = \varepsilon^2/(4n) \le \varepsilon^2/4 < \varepsilon^2$, and therefore $d_2(x,y) < \varepsilon$. [L3, L4, L5, L7]

2.1 Claim 1: let $(x_k)$ be a Cauchy sequence in $(\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$. By step 1.1 it is a Cauchy sequence of reals, so by [A1] it converges to some $x \in \mathbb{R}$, and by step 1.1 again $x_k \to x$ in $(\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$. Hence every Cauchy sequence in $(\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$ converges in it. [step 1.1, A1, L2]

2.2 Now let $(x^{(k)})$ be a Cauchy sequence in $(\mathbb{R}^n, d_2)$ and fix $j < n$. By step 1.2, $|x^{(m)}_j - x^{(l)}_j| \le d_2(x^{(m)}, x^{(l)})$ for all $m, l$, so the real sequence $(x^{(k)}_j)_{k}$ is Cauchy, and by [A1] it converges; its limit is unique, so the notation $y_j := \lim_{k} x^{(k)}_j$ denotes a single real. [step 1.2, A1, L2, L8]

3.1 The assignment $j \mapsto y_j$ is a function $n \to \mathbb{R}$, hence an element $y \in \mathbb{R}^n$; no choice is used, because $y_j$ is the unique limit of the $j$-th coordinate sequence. [step 2.2, L3, construct]

3.2 For each $j < n$ let $K_j$ be the least natural such that $|x^{(k)}_j - y_j| < \varepsilon/(2n)$ for all $k \ge K_j$, which exists because the coordinate sequence converges to $y_j$ and every nonempty set of naturals has a least element; and put $K := \max\{K_j : j < n\}$, a maximum of a nonempty finite set of naturals since $n \ge 1$. [step 2.2, L6, L7, choose]

4.1 For every $k \ge K$ and every $j < n$ we have $k \ge K_j$, hence $|x^{(k)}_j - y_j| < \varepsilon/(2n)$, and therefore $d_2(x^{(k)}, y) < \varepsilon$ by step 1.3. [step 1.3, step 3.1, step 3.2]

5.1 Since $\varepsilon > 0$ was an arbitrary real, $x^{(k)} \to y$ in $(\mathbb{R}^n, d_2)$ with $y \in \mathbb{R}^n$; so every Cauchy sequence in $(\mathbb{R}^n, d_2)$ converges in it, which with step 2.1 gives claims 1 and 2. [step 2.1, step 4.1, L2] ∎

## Remarks

- **The proof is the Cauchy criterion plus two inequalities.** Step 1.2 says a coordinate difference is at most the Euclidean distance, which turns a Cauchy sequence of points into $n$ Cauchy sequences of reals; step 1.3 says that coordinates uniformly below $\varepsilon/(2n)$ force the Euclidean distance below $\varepsilon$, which turns $n$ convergent coordinate sequences back into one convergent sequence of points. Nothing else about $\mathbb{R}^n$ is used, and in particular the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is not needed here.
- **The same two inequalities hold for $d_1$ and $d_\infty$**, with the same proof of completeness. For $d_1(x,y) = \sum_{k<n}|x_k-y_k|$: each term is at most the sum ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]), so $|x_j-y_j| \le d_1(x,y)$; and $|x_j-y_j| < \varepsilon/(2n)$ for all $j < n$ gives $d_1(x,y) \le n\varepsilon/(2n) = \varepsilon/2 < \varepsilon$. For $d_\infty(x,y) = \max\{|x_k-y_k| : k<n\}$: the maximum dominates each entry and is one of them ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]), so $|x_j-y_j| \le d_\infty(x,y)$, and entries all below $\varepsilon/2$ make the maximum at most $\varepsilon/2$. Substituting either pair of inequalities for steps 1.2 and 1.3 leaves the rest of the proof unchanged, so $(\mathbb{R}^n, d_1)$ and $(\mathbb{R}^n, d_\infty)$ are complete as well. Nothing later on this page uses that.
- **No choice is spent.** The limit point $y$ is assembled coordinatewise in step 3.1 from limits that are unique, and the finitely many indices $K_j$ of step 3.2 are made canonical by taking the least one. This matters because completeness proofs elsewhere on this page do spend $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$, and the contrast is worth keeping visible.
- **Where the least-upper-bound property is.** Entirely inside [[thm-cauchy-criterion-via-lub]]. This theorem is a transfer result: it moves completeness from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$ and adds no new content about the reals.

## Statement

Every nonempty subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ has a least element: there is $\ell \in S$ with $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A nonempty subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. Define $T = \{\, n \in \mathbb{N} : \text{every } m \text{ with } m \le n \text{ satisfies } m \notin S \,\}$ (informally, no element of $S$ is $\le n$).

[L1] Induction principle: a subset of $\mathbb{N}$ that contains $0$ and is closed under $\sigma$ equals $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L2] $m < n \iff \sigma(m) \le n$; consequently no $k$ satisfies $n < k < \sigma(n)$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]).

[L3] Exactly one of $s < n$, $s = n$, $n < s$ holds ([[lem-nat-trichotomy]]); and $n < s \iff \sigma(n) \le s$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]).

[L4] $\sigma$ is injective (Peano axiom P2) ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]).

[L5] $\sigma(a) + i = \sigma(a + i)$ for all $a, i$ (the left successor law, [[lem-nat-add-successor-left]]).

[L6] $0 + k = k$ for all $k$ ([[lem-nat-add-identity]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose $S$ is nonempty but has no least element. [assume-contra]

1.2 If $m < \sigma(n)$ then $m \le n$: by [L2] applied to $m$ and $\sigma(n)$ we get $\sigma(m) \le \sigma(n)$, say $\sigma(m) + i = \sigma(n)$; then $\sigma(m + i) = \sigma(m) + i = \sigma(n)$ [L5], so $m + i = n$ by injectivity [L4], hence $m \le n$. [L2, L4, L5]

2.1 First, $0 \in T$: if $0 \in S$ then $0 \le s$ for all $s \in S$, since $0 + s = s$ [L6], making $0$ a least element, contrary to the assumption; hence $0 \notin S$; moreover $m \le 0$ forces $m = 0$, because $m \ne 0$ would give $0 < m$ (as $0 + m = m$ [L6] with $m \ne 0$) while $m \le 0$ gives $m < 0$, and [L3] admits at most one of these; so every $m \le 0$ lies outside $S$. [step 1.1, L3, L6, given]

2.2 Next, $T$ is closed under $\sigma$: assume $n \in T$; if $\sigma(n) \in S$ then no $s \in S$ satisfies $s < \sigma(n)$ (else $s \le n$ by step 1.2, so $s \notin S$ because $n \in T$, a contradiction), hence $\sigma(n) \le s$ for all $s \in S$ by [L3], making $\sigma(n)$ a least element, contrary to the assumption; therefore $\sigma(n) \notin S$, and any $m$ with $m \le \sigma(n)$ satisfies $m = \sigma(n)$ or $m \ne \sigma(n)$; in the second case $m \le \sigma(n)$ together with $m \ne \sigma(n)$ gives $m < \sigma(n)$ by the definition of the strict order, hence $m \le n$ by step 1.2 and $m \notin S$ because $n \in T$, while in the first case $m = \sigma(n) \notin S$; so every $m \le \sigma(n)$ lies outside $S$, giving $\sigma(n) \in T$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L3]

3.1 By the induction principle [L1], from $0 \in T$ and closure under $\sigma$, $T = \mathbb{N}$; then for every $n$, taking $m = n \le n$ shows $n \notin S$, so $S = \varnothing$, contradicting nonemptiness; therefore $S$ has a least element. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L1, discharge-contradiction] ∎
