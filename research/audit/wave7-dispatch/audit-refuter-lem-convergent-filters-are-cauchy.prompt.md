You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as a
read-only adversarial proof-refuter for the published-page audit. You are
tool-less: you cannot open a file, run a command, browse, edit, or delegate.
Everything you may rely on is reproduced in the `This dispatch` section. Return
evidence only; Audit-Alpha alone adjudicates and edits.

## Triage — the standing rule (verbatim, binding on you)

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct
  citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

## Adversarial standard

Read the target's title, Statement/Definition/Example/Statement refuted, Facts &
Assumptions, every numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks.
Try to falsify the public claim and every load-bearing inference.

1. Compare every cited fact with the supplied source text before alleging that
   it is weak. Check domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, direction, conclusion,
   and whether the source licenses the exact use.
2. Check that the title and public statement assert no more than the proof
   establishes, and that every proof step uses only available premises.
3. Check both directions of biconditionals, uniqueness/existence claims,
   induction and limiting arguments, empty/zero/endpoint/degenerate cases,
   extended-real conventions, index shifts, and hidden division or choice.
4. Re-read Remarks as skeptically as a numbered step. A false mathematical
   remark is a defect even when the proof is sound.
5. When the target is marked `ai-generated`, actively search for a
   counterexample to its claim, witness, or refutation rather than merely
   checking prose consistency.
6. Treat a false public claim, logically invalid proof, missing necessary
   hypothesis, circularity, or materially inaccurate load-bearing citation as
   fatal. Do not inflate an expository omission or a gap closable within thirty
   seconds into a defect.

## Output format

Reply with exactly this structure and no preamble:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

If `DEFECTS`, give one block per finding:

```text
FINDING 1
  location: [exact title, section, fact label, or numbered step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [the exact mathematical assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, missing hypothesis, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]
```

Then always end with:

```text
BOUNDARY: [specific boundary/counterexample checks and their disposition]
SOURCES:  [confirm every supplied cited item used by the target was inspected]
CHECKED:  [confirm the title, public claim, every numbered step, and Remarks were read]

## Statement

Every filter converging in the induced topology of a uniform space is Cauchy.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A filter $\mathcal F$ converging to $x$ in a uniform space.

[L1] Filter convergence means that every neighbourhood of the limit belongs to the filter ([[def-filter-convergence-and-cluster-point]]).

[L2] Entourage balls form neighbourhood bases, and every entourage has a symmetric square root ([[thm-uniformity-induces-a-topology]], [[def-uniform-space-by-entourages]], [[lem-symmetric-entourages-form-a-base]]).

[L3] A Cauchy filter has an $E$-small member for every entourage $E$ ([[def-cauchy-filter-in-a-uniform-space]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $E$ be an entourage and choose a symmetric entourage $D$ with $D\circ D\subseteq E$. [L2, choose]

1.2 The neighbourhood $D[x]$ belongs to $\mathcal F$ by convergence. [L1, L2]

2.1 Since $D$ is symmetric, $D[x]\times D[x]\subseteq D^{-1}\circ D=D\circ D\subseteq E$, so $D[x]$ is $E$-small. [step 1.1, step 1.2]

3.1 As $E$ was arbitrary, $\mathcal F$ is Cauchy by [L3]. [step 2.1, L3] ∎

## Definition

Let $\mathcal F$ be a filter on a topological space $X$ and let $p\in X$.

- $\mathcal F$ **converges to $p$**, written $\mathcal F\to p$, if every neighbourhood of $p$ belongs to $\mathcal F$.
- $p$ is a **cluster point** of $\mathcal F$ if $N\cap A\ne\varnothing$ for every neighbourhood $N$ of $p$ and every $A\in\mathcal F$.

The second condition says precisely that the neighbourhood filter at $p$ and $\mathcal F$ have no disjoint members.

## Definition

Let $X$ be a set and write $\Delta_X=\{(x,x):x\in X\}$ for its diagonal ([[def-the-diagonal-of-a-space]]). For $E\subseteq X\times X$, put $E[x]:=\{y\in X:(x,y)\in E\}$, $E^{-1}:=\{(y,x):(x,y)\in E\}$, and $E\circ F:=\{(x,z):\text{some }y\text{ has }(x,y)\in E,(y,z)\in F\}$.

A **uniformity** on $X$ is a filter $\mathcal U$ on $X\times X$ ([[def-filter]]) such that:

- every $E\in\mathcal U$ contains $\Delta_X$;
- $E\in\mathcal U$ implies $E^{-1}\in\mathcal U$;
- for every $E\in\mathcal U$ there is $D\in\mathcal U$ with $D\circ D\subseteq E$.

Its members are **entourages**. A **uniform space** is a set equipped with a uniformity. The induced topology and its neighbourhoods are constructed in [[thm-uniformity-induces-a-topology]].

## Statement

If $\mathcal U$ is a uniformity on $X$, then its symmetric entourages form a filter base: for every $E\in\mathcal U$ there is a symmetric $D\in\mathcal U$ with $D\subseteq E$. More generally, for every entourage $E$ and every integer $n\ge 1$, there is a symmetric entourage $D$ whose $n$-fold composite satisfies $D^{\circ n}\subseteq E$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A uniformity $\mathcal U$ on $X$, an entourage $E\in\mathcal U$, and an integer $n\ge 1$.

[A1] A uniformity is a filter whose members are closed under inverse and admit square roots ([[def-uniform-space-by-entourages]]).

[L1] A nonempty, proper family that refines every pair of its members is a filter base ([[def-filter-base]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Choose $R\in\mathcal U$ with $R\circ R\subseteq E$, and put $S:=R\cap R^{-1}$. [A1, choose]

1.2 Put $E_0:=E$. By finitely iterating the square-root axiom, choose entourages $E_1,\ldots,E_n$ such that $E_{k+1}\circ E_{k+1}\subseteq E_k$ for $0\le k<n$, and put $D:=E_n\cap E_n^{-1}$. [A1, choose]

2.1 The set $S$ is an entourage, since $R,R^{-1}\in\mathcal U$ and a filter is closed under intersections; also $S=S^{-1}$ and $S\subseteq R\circ R\subseteq E$, because every entourage contains the diagonal. [step 1.1, A1]

2.2 The entourage $D$ is symmetric and $D\subseteq E_n$. Induction on $k$ gives $D^{\circ 2^k}\subseteq E_{n-k}$ for $0\le k\le n$, hence $D^{\circ 2^n}\subseteq E$. Since every entourage contains the diagonal and $n\le 2^n$, one may insert diagonal factors to obtain $D^{\circ n}\subseteq D^{\circ 2^n}\subseteq E$. [step 1.2, A1, algebra]

3.1 Thus symmetric entourages refine every entourage; their intersections are symmetric entourages and none is empty because each contains the diagonal, so they form a filter base by [L1]. [step 2.1, L1]

4.1 Therefore symmetric entourages form a base and admit the asserted finite-composite control. [step 3.1, step 2.2] ∎

## Statement

For a uniformity $\mathcal U$ on $X$, call $O\subseteq X$ open when every $x\in O$ has an entourage $E$ with $E[x]\subseteq O$. These open sets form a topology on $X$. Its neighbourhood filter at $x$ has $\{E[x]:E\in\mathcal U\}$ as a base.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A uniform space $(X,\mathcal U)$.

[A1] Entourages contain the diagonal, are closed under finite intersection, and have symmetric square roots ([[def-uniform-space-by-entourages]], [[lem-symmetric-entourages-form-a-base]]).

[L1] A topology contains $\varnothing,X$, is closed under arbitrary unions, and under binary intersections ([[def-topological-space]]).

[L2] A neighbourhood base at $x$ refines every neighbourhood of $x$ ([[def-neighbourhood-top]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The sets $\varnothing$ and $X$ are open: the first has no points to test, and for $x\in X$ every entourage ball is contained in $X$. [A1]

1.2 An arbitrary union of open sets is open, because a point in the union lies in one member and retains that member's entourage ball. [A1]

1.3 If $x\in O\cap P$, choose entourage balls $E[x]\subseteq O$ and $F[x]\subseteq P$; then $(E\cap F)[x]\subseteq O\cap P$, so binary intersections are open. [A1]

2.1 By steps 1.1 to 1.3, the open sets form a topology by [L1]. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, L1]

3.1 Let $E$ be an entourage and define $$ O_E=\{y\in E[x]:F[y]\subseteq E[x]\text{ for some }F\in\mathcal U\}. $$ This set is open. Indeed, given $y\in O_E$, choose $F$ as displayed and then a symmetric $G$ with $G\circ G\subseteq F$. If $z\in G[y]$, symmetry gives $G[z]\subseteq(G\circ G)[y]\subseteq F[y]\subseteq E[x]$, so $z\in O_E$; hence $G[y]\subseteq O_E$. Now choose a symmetric $D$ with $D\circ D\subseteq E$. If $y\in D[x]$, then $D[y]\subseteq E[x]$, so $y\in O_E$. Thus $x\in D[x]\subseteq O_E\subseteq E[x]$, proving that $E[x]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$. [A1, step 2.1]

4.1 Conversely, if $N$ is a neighbourhood of $x$, it contains an open set $O$ with $x\in O$; the definition of the topology supplies an entourage $E$ with $E[x]\subseteq O\subseteq N$. Thus the entourage balls refine every neighbourhood, and by step 3.1 they are themselves neighbourhoods. They form a neighbourhood base by [L2]. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L2] ∎
