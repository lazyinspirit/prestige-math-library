You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as a
read-only adversarial proof-refuter for the published-page audit. You are
tool-less: you cannot open a file, run a command, browse, edit, or delegate.
Everything you may rely on is reproduced in the `This dispatch` section. Return
evidence only; Audit-Alpha alone adjudicates and edits.

## Triage — the standing rule (verbatim, binding on you)

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct
  citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

## Adversarial standard

Read the target's title, Statement/Definition/Example/Statement refuted, Facts &
Assumptions, every numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks.
Try to falsify the public claim and every load-bearing inference.

1. Compare every cited fact with the supplied source text before alleging that
   it is weak. Check domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, direction, conclusion,
   and whether the source licenses the exact use.
2. Check that the title and public statement assert no more than the proof
   establishes, and that every proof step uses only available premises.
3. Check both directions of biconditionals, uniqueness/existence claims,
   induction and limiting arguments, empty/zero/endpoint/degenerate cases,
   extended-real conventions, index shifts, and hidden division or choice.
4. Re-read Remarks as skeptically as a numbered step. A false mathematical
   remark is a defect even when the proof is sound.
5. When the target is marked `ai-generated`, actively search for a
   counterexample to its claim, witness, or refutation rather than merely
   checking prose consistency.
6. Treat a false public claim, logically invalid proof, missing necessary
   hypothesis, circularity, or materially inaccurate load-bearing citation as
   fatal. Do not inflate an expository omission or a gap closable within thirty
   seconds into a defect.

## Output format

Reply with exactly this structure and no preamble:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

If `DEFECTS`, give one block per finding:

  location: [exact title, section, fact label, or numbered step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [the exact mathematical assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, missing hypothesis, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]

## Statement refuted

**Refuted claim:** the converse of [[thm-stolz-cesaro]]. That is: if $(b_k)$ is
strictly increasing with range not bounded above and the quotients $a_k/b_k$
converge, then the difference quotients
$(a_{k+1}-a_k)/(b_{k+1}-b_k)$ converge too.

The witness is $a_k = s_k$, the alternating sequence of
[[lem-alternating-sequence]] usually written $(-1)^k$, and $b_k = k$. Then
$b_0 = 0$, so the quotient $a_k/b_k$ is formed for $k \ge 1$ only, exactly as
[[thm-stolz-cesaro]] is stated; and there

$$\frac{a_k}{b_k} = \frac{s_k}{k}, \qquad \Big|\frac{a_k}{b_k}\Big| = \frac1k \longrightarrow 0,$$

while the difference quotient is

$$\frac{a_{k+1}-a_k}{b_{k+1}-b_k} \;=\; s_{k+1} - s_k \;=\; -2 s_k,$$

which takes the value $-2$ at even $k$ and $2$ at odd $k$ and does not converge.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The alternating sequence $(s_k)$ with $s_0 = 1$ and $s_{\sigma(k)} = -s_k$; the sequences $a_k := s_k$ and $b_k := k \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$; and the difference quotients $d_k := (a_{k+1}-a_k)(b_{k+1}-b_k)^{-1}$.

[L1] The alternating sequence: $|s_k| = 1$ for every $k$, $s_{k+1} = -s_k$, $s_{e_j} = 1$ and $s_{o_j} = -1$ along the even and odd index maps ([[lem-alternating-sequence]]).

[L2] $(s_k)$ is bounded and does not converge ([[fs-bounded-implies-convergent]]).

[L3] The canonical naturals of $\mathbb{R}$ are positive for $k \ge 1$ and strictly increasing ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]), and no real bounds them all ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); strict monotonicity and boundedness of real sequences ([[def-monotone-sequence]], [[def-bounded-set]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L4] Convergence of real sequences and uniqueness of limits ([[def-real-limit]], [[lem-limit-unique]]); convergence depends only on a tail ([[lem-limit-of-tail]]); the reciprocal Archimedean property ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]]).

[L5] Algebra of limits, in particular that a scalar multiple of a convergent sequence converges ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]]).

[L6] Order arithmetic: $|u| \ge 0$ and $|uv| = |u||v|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]); a positive element is invertible with positive inverse and reciprocation reverses the order ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]); the order is total and transitive ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L7] The hypotheses and conclusion of Stolz-Cesaro in the $\infty/\infty$ form ([[thm-stolz-cesaro]]).

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $(b_k)$ is strictly increasing, its range is not bounded above, $b_0 = 0$ and $b_k > 0$ for $k \ge 1$; so the hypotheses of [[thm-stolz-cesaro]] on $(b_k)$ hold with $K_0 = 1$. [L3, L7]

1.2 $|s_k| = 1$ for every $k$, and $(s_k)$ does not converge. [L1, L2]

2.1 The tail quotients $q_j := a_{j+1}/b_{j+1} = s_{j+1}(j+1)^{-1}$ satisfy $|q_j| = (j+1)^{-1}$; given a real $\varepsilon > 0$ and a natural $m \ge 1$ with $1/m < \varepsilon$, every $j \ge m$ has $|q_j - 0| = (j+1)^{-1} < \varepsilon$, so $q_j \to 0$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L4, L6]

2.2 $b_{k+1} - b_k = 1$ for every $k$, so $d_k = a_{k+1} - a_k = s_{k+1} - s_k = -s_k - s_k = -2s_k$, which is $-2$ when $k$ is even and $2$ when $k$ is odd. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1, L3]

3.1 $(d_k)$ does not converge: were $d_k \to M$, then $s_k = (-1/2)\,d_k$ would converge to $-M/2$ by the scalar-multiple rule, contradicting step 1.2. [step 1.2, step 2.2, L5]

4.1 So $(b_k)$ is strictly increasing and unbounded, the quotients $a_k/b_k$ converge to $0$ over the indices $k \ge 1$, and the difference quotients do not converge: the converse of Stolz-Cesaro is false. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L7] ∎

## Remarks

- **The implication is genuinely one-way, and the reason is averaging.** The
  conclusion of [[thm-stolz-cesaro]] is obtained by summing the difference
  quotients against the weights $b_{k+1}-b_k$ and dividing by $b_n$, which is a
  weighted average. An average can converge while what is averaged oscillates,
  and here it does: the quotients $a_k/b_k$ are damped by the growing
  denominator, and no information about $d_k$ survives.

- **The same phenomenon, in the summability language.** With $b_k = k$ the
  weights are equal, so this is the Cesaro situation of
  [[fs-cesaro-converse]] and [[ex-cesaro-means-of-alternating]] in another
  costume; the divergent object is the same alternating sequence.

- **The index range is not a technicality.** $b_0 = 0$, so $a_0/b_0$ does not
  denote anything, and the quotient sequence exists only from $k = 1$. That is
  why [[thm-stolz-cesaro]] is stated for the tail, and why the convergence
  asserted above is asserted over $k \ge 1$.

## Statement

Let $F$ be a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and let
$\varepsilon \in F$ with $\varepsilon > 0$. Then there is a natural number
$n \ge 1$ such that

$$\frac{1}{n \cdot 1_F} < \varepsilon ,$$

where $n \cdot 1_F$ is the canonical natural of $F$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]]) and
$1/(n \cdot 1_F)$ is its multiplicative inverse ([[def-field]]). As is standard
we abbreviate $n \cdot 1_F$ to $n$ and write the conclusion $1/n < \varepsilon$.

This is the **reciprocal form** of the Archimedean property.
[[thm-of-archimedean]] on its own delivers only the assertion that the canonical
naturals are cofinal, $x < n \cdot 1_F$; the form actually used in analysis, that
the reciprocals of the naturals get below every positive bound, is the statement
above, and it is recorded separately so that no proof has to reconstruct the
inversion step in passing.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $F$ and an element $\varepsilon \in F$ with $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] Archimedean property: for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Inverses and order: if $a > 0$ then $a^{-1} > 0$, and if $0 < a < b$ then $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Field arithmetic: an element $a$ with $a > 0$ is nonzero by trichotomy, hence has a multiplicative inverse $a^{-1}$, and $(a^{-1})^{-1} = a$ ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Since $\varepsilon > 0$, trichotomy gives $\varepsilon \ne 0$, so $\varepsilon^{-1}$ exists, and $\varepsilon^{-1} > 0$. [given, L2, L3]

2.1 Apply [L1] to $x = \varepsilon^{-1}$: fix a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $\varepsilon^{-1} < n \cdot 1_F$. [step 1.1, L1, choose]

3.1 Chaining the two displayed inequalities gives $0 < \varepsilon^{-1} < n \cdot 1_F$; in particular $n \cdot 1_F > 0$, so $n \cdot 1_F \ne 0$ and $1/(n \cdot 1_F)$ is defined. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L3]

4.1 Apply the second claim of [L2] with $a = \varepsilon^{-1}$ and $b = n \cdot 1_F$: $0 < (n \cdot 1_F)^{-1} < (\varepsilon^{-1})^{-1}$. [step 3.1, L2]

5.1 By [L3], $(\varepsilon^{-1})^{-1} = \varepsilon$, so the natural number $n \ge 1$ fixed in step 2.1 satisfies $1/(n \cdot 1_F) < \varepsilon$, which is the assertion. [step 4.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Monotonicity gives the eventual form for free.** If $m \ge n \ge 1$ then
  $m \cdot 1_F \ge n \cdot 1_F > 0$, because $k \mapsto k \cdot 1_F$ is strictly
  increasing on the naturals $\ge 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]), and so
  $1/(m \cdot 1_F) \le 1/(n \cdot 1_F) < \varepsilon$ by [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]
  again. So the corollary yields not merely one index but a threshold: every
  $m \ge n$ satisfies $1/m < \varepsilon$. That one extra line is what a
  convergence proof needs, and it is left to the caller rather than folded into
  the statement, because the caller usually has a threshold of its own to combine
  it with.

- **Completeness is used only through [[thm-of-archimedean]].** Nothing here
  needs the least-upper-bound property directly. The corollary therefore holds
  verbatim in any Archimedean ordered field, in particular in $\mathbb{Q}$, and
  it fails in a non-Archimedean ordered field, where an infinitesimal
  $\varepsilon > 0$ is below every $1/n$ by construction.

- The equivalence is exact: the reciprocal form implies the cofinal form back
  again, since given $x > 0$ one applies it to $\varepsilon = 1/x$. The two are
  the same property written on the two sides of the inversion, and only the
  direction proved above is used in this library.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ denotes the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a subset of it.

The notions **upper bound** and **bounded above** are already fixed by
[[def-complete-ordered-field]] and are only recalled here, never redefined:
$u \in \mathbb{R}$ is an *upper bound* of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$, and
$S$ is *bounded above* if it has at least one upper bound. The dual notions are:

- $\ell \in \mathbb{R}$ is a **lower bound** of $S$ if $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.
- $S$ is **bounded below** if it has at least one lower bound.
- $S$ is **bounded** if it is both bounded above and bounded below, that is, if
  there are $\ell, u \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\ell \le s \le u$ for every $s \in S$.

## Remarks

- A bound is an element of $\mathbb{R}$ and is not required to lie in $S$. A
  bound that does lie in $S$ is a maximum or a minimum ([[def-max-min]]), and
  that is a strictly stronger condition ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Bounds come in half-lines: if $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$ then so is every
  $\ell'' \le \ell$, and if $u$ is an upper bound then so is every $u'' \ge u$.
  Consequently a set that has one bound of a given kind has infinitely many, and
  the interesting question is whether the collection of them has a best element,
  which is what a supremum ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) or an infimum
  ([[def-infimum]]) is.
- Bounded above and bounded below are independent conditions. The set
  $A = \{\, n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} : n \ge 1 \,\}$ of canonical naturals of
  $\mathbb{R}$ is bounded below by $0$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]) and is not
  bounded above ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); its reflection $-A$ is bounded above
  and not bounded below ([[lem-reflection]]).
- The empty set is bounded, and vacuously so: every real number is both an upper
  bound and a lower bound of $\emptyset$, since the defining condition quantifies
  over no elements. Having bounds is therefore much weaker than having a least
  upper bound or a greatest lower bound ([[fs-every-set-has-sup]]).

## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq F$.

- $u \in F$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$; $S$ is
  **bounded above** if it has an upper bound.
- $u \in F$ is a **least upper bound** (or **supremum**, $\sup S$) of $S$ if $u$
  is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le u'$ for every upper bound $u'$ of $S$.

$F$ is a **complete ordered field** (equivalently, $F$ has the
**least-upper-bound property**, or is **Dedekind complete**) if every nonempty
$S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$.

## Remarks

- A least upper bound, if it exists, is unique (two least upper bounds are each
  $\le$ the other, so equal by antisymmetry of the order).
- Applying the property to $\{-s : s \in S\}$ yields the dual **greatest lower
  bound** (infimum) property, so the two are equivalent.
- The Dedekind-cut reals have this property by construction
  ([[thm-dedekind-complete]]); the Cauchy-sequence reals acquire it via
  [[cor-cauchy-reals-lub-complete]]. This definition is the target for the
  uniqueness theorem [[thm-uniqueness-complete-ordered-field]].

## Definition

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]), with $\mathbb{R}$ ordered
as in [[def-real-order]] and [[def-complete-ordered-field]], and with
$\mathbb{N}$ ordered as in [[def-nat-order]]. The sequence is:

- **nondecreasing** when $x_j \le x_k$ for all $j \le k$;
- **increasing** (or *strictly increasing*) when $x_j < x_k$ for all $j < k$;
- **nonincreasing** when $x_j \ge x_k$ for all $j \le k$;
- **decreasing** (or *strictly decreasing*) when $x_j > x_k$ for all $j < k$;
- **monotone** when it is nondecreasing or nonincreasing;
- **strictly monotone** when it is increasing or decreasing;
- **eventually monotone** when some tail $x^{(K)}$ ([[def-sequence]]) is
  monotone, that is when there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that the restriction of
  the comparison to indices $\ge K$ is one-signed.

An increasing sequence is nondecreasing and a decreasing sequence is
nonincreasing, since $j \le k$ means $j < k$ or $j = k$ and the second case gives
equality. A sequence that is both nondecreasing and nonincreasing is constant.

**Consecutive comparisons suffice, and that is an induction.** The four
conditions above quantify over *all* pairs of indices, but what one checks in
practice, and what a recursive construction delivers, is the comparison of
consecutive terms. The two agree:

> $(x_k)$ is nondecreasing **if and only if** $x_k \le x_{\sigma(k)}$ for every
> $k \in \mathbb{N}$, and $(x_k)$ is increasing **if and only if**
> $x_k < x_{\sigma(k)}$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$; likewise, with the
> inequalities reversed, for nonincreasing and decreasing.

The forward implications are the instances $j = k$, $k = \sigma(k)$ of the
definitions, using $k < \sigma(k)$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]). For the converse,
suppose $x_i \le x_{\sigma(i)}$ for every $i$ and fix $k$; we show by induction
on $k$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]) that $x_j \le x_k$ for every $j \le k$. For
$k = 0$: $j \le 0$ forces $j = 0$, and $x_0 \le x_0$. Assume the statement for
$k$ and let $j \le \sigma(k)$. If $j = \sigma(k)$ then $x_j \le x_{\sigma(k)}$ by
reflexivity. Otherwise $j < \sigma(k)$, and then $j \le k$: were $k < j$ we would
have $k < j < \sigma(k)$, which [[lem-nat-discrete]] excludes, so $j \le k$ by
totality of the order on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]). The induction
hypothesis gives $x_j \le x_k$, and $x_k \le x_{\sigma(k)}$ by assumption, so
$x_j \le x_{\sigma(k)}$ by transitivity. This completes the induction. The three
remaining equivalences are the same argument with $\le$ replaced by $<$,
$\ge$ or $>$, transitivity of the strict order being used in the same place.

**Boundedness of a monotone sequence is one-sided.** A nondecreasing sequence is
bounded below by its first term $x_0$, and a nonincreasing sequence is bounded
above by $x_0$, both immediately from the definition with $j = 0$. So for a
nondecreasing sequence the only substantive question is whether it is bounded
above, and for a nonincreasing sequence whether it is bounded below. The range of
$(x_k)$ is the set $\{x_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$ ([[def-sequence]]), and it is
bounded above, bounded below or bounded in the sense of [[def-bounded-set]]
exactly when the sequence is.

## Remarks

- **The naming is the one that keeps "increasing" strict.** Some texts use
  *increasing* for what is called *nondecreasing* here and *strictly increasing*
  for what is called *increasing*. This library follows the convention in which
  the unqualified word is strict, and always writes *nondecreasing* when
  equality is allowed, so that no statement on this page depends on which
  convention a reader arrives with. Where a proof needs the weak form it says
  *nondecreasing*, and where it needs the strict form it says *increasing*.

- **Eventual monotonicity is exactly monotonicity of a tail**, and by
  [[lem-limit-of-tail]] a sequence and its tails converge to the same limits and
  are Cauchy together. So every convergence statement about monotone sequences on
  this page extends verbatim to eventually monotone sequences, with the limit
  unchanged; only statements about specific terms, such as the identification of
  the limit as the supremum of the *whole* range, need the hypothesis at every
  index. The monotone convergence theorem is a case in point: an eventually
  nondecreasing bounded sequence converges, but to the supremum of the range of
  the monotone tail, which may be smaller than the supremum of the whole range.

- **Monotone is strictly weaker than strictly monotone, and neither is generic.**
  A constant sequence is monotone and not strictly monotone; the sequence with
  terms $1$ and $-1$ alternating ([[lem-alternating-sequence]]) is not monotone
  and not eventually monotone, since every tail contains both values infinitely
  often. That sequence is bounded, so boundedness alone gives neither form of
  monotonicity; what it does give is a monotone *subsequence*
  ([[lem-peak-monotone-subsequence]]), and that is the route to
  Bolzano-Weierstrass.

## Definition

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ ([[def-field]]) together with a subset
$P \subseteq F$, the set of **positive** elements (the *positive cone*),
satisfying:

- **(O1) Trichotomy.** For each $x \in F$, exactly one of the following holds:
  $x \in P$, or $x = 0$, or $-x \in P$.
- **(O2) Closure.** If $x, y \in P$ then $x + y \in P$ and $x \cdot y \in P$.

We write $x > 0$ for $x \in P$ (read "$x$ is positive"), and define the order by

$$a < b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; b - a \in P, \qquad a \le b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; a < b \text{ or } a = b.$$

Thus $a > b$ means $b < a$, and $a \ge b$ means $b \le a$. An element $x$ with
$-x \in P$ (equivalently $x < 0$) is called **negative**.

## Remarks

- By trichotomy applied to $b - a$, for any $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$,
  $a = b$, $a > b$ holds; this makes $\le$ a total order.
- (O2) says the positives are closed under addition and multiplication: sums and
  products of positives are positive.
- The rationals ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and both constructions of the reals
  ([[thm-reals-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-dedekind-ordered-field]]) are ordered
  fields, so every fact proved here from (O1)-(O2) holds in each of them.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]],
[[def-real-numbers]]) with its order and absolute value ([[def-real-order]]), and
$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers with its order ([[def-natural-numbers]],
[[def-nat-order]]).

A **sequence of reals** is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$. We write
$x_k$ for the value $x(k)$, call it the **$k$-th term**, and write $(x_k)$, or
$(x_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$, for the function itself. The **range** of $(x_k)$ is
the subset $\{\, x_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals and let $P$ be a property of indices.

- $(x_k)$ is **bounded** if there is $M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for
  every $k \in \mathbb{N}$; it is **unbounded** otherwise.
- $P$ holds **eventually** if there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $P(k)$ holds
  for every $k \ge K$.
- $P$ holds **frequently** if for every $K \in \mathbb{N}$ there is some
  $k \ge K$ for which $P(k)$ holds.
- For $K \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$K$-th tail** of $(x_k)$ is the sequence
  $x^{(K)}$ defined by $x^{(K)}_j := x_{j + K}$ for $j \in \mathbb{N}$; it is
  again a sequence of reals.
- A function $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is **strictly increasing** if
  $n_j < n_k$ whenever $j < k$. For such an $n$, the **subsequence** of $(x_k)$
  along $n$ is the composite $x \circ n$, written $(x_{n_k})_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$;
  it is again a sequence of reals.

**Convergence and Cauchyness are not defined here.** They are already fixed, for
sequences of reals, by the published [[def-real-limit]]: $(x_k)$ *converges* to
$x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is
$K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$, and $(x_k)$
is *Cauchy* when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$
with $|x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$. This page builds the
toolkit for those two notions and does not restate them. A sequence
**converges** if it converges to some real, and **diverges** if it does not.

## Remarks

- **Identification of $\mathbb{Q}$ with its image.** The map $q \mapsto \hat q$
  is an embedding of ordered fields ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and as is
  standard we write $q$ for $\hat q$, so that a rational may be compared with a
  real without further comment. [[def-real-limit]] is stated with the hat; every
  rational $\varepsilon$ occurring on this page is its image under this
  embedding.

- **Rational and real $\varepsilon$ agree.** [[def-real-limit]] tests convergence
  against every *rational* $\varepsilon > 0$, and its own remark records that
  this loses nothing. Spelled out: suppose that for every rational
  $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all
  $k \ge K$, and let $\eta > 0$ be an arbitrary *real*. Since $0 < \eta$,
  density of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) supplies a
  rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, and the index $K$
  belonging to that $\varepsilon$ satisfies $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon < \eta$ for
  all $k \ge K$. The converse implication is immediate, since every positive
  rational is a positive real. So the two formulations define the same relation,
  and the same two lines apply verbatim to the Cauchy condition and to any
  condition of the shape "for every $\varepsilon > 0$, eventually
  $\cdots < \varepsilon$". Proofs on this page therefore run the test with a real
  $\varepsilon$ wherever that is more convenient, and say so by citing this
  remark; nothing is smuggled in.

- **Constant sequences converge.** For $c \in \mathbb{R}$ the constant sequence
  $x_k := c$ converges to $c$, because $|x_k - c| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ for
  every $\varepsilon > 0$ and every $k$; it is bounded by $|c|$.

- **Eventually and frequently are dual.** $P$ holds frequently exactly when
  $\lnot P$ does not hold eventually, and $P$ holds eventually exactly when
  $\lnot P$ does not hold frequently. So the two quantifier patterns are
  negations of one another applied to the complementary property, and there is no
  third pattern hiding between them.

- **A sequence is not its range.** $(x_k)$ is a function, not a set, and the
  range does not determine the function: the sequence $x_0 = 0$, $x_k = 1$ for
  $k \ge 1$ and the sequence $y_0 = y_1 = 0$, $y_k = 1$ for $k \ge 2$ have the
  same range $\{0, 1\}$, yet they differ at $k = 1$, so they are different
  sequences. Order and repetition are part of the data and the range forgets
  both. Boundedness, on the other hand, depends only on the range.

- **Indexing.** Sequences here start at $k = 0$ because $\mathbb{N}$ contains
  $0$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]). Texts that index from $1$ describe the same
  objects up to a shift, and the shift changes nothing about convergence, by
  [[lem-limit-of-tail]].

## Example

Let $(s_k)$ be the alternating sequence of [[lem-alternating-sequence]], the
unique sequence of reals with $s_0 = 1$ and $s_{\sigma(k)} = -s_k$, usually
written $s_k = (-1)^k$. Its Cesaro means ([[def-cesaro-mean]]) are

$$\sigma_n \;=\; \frac{s_0 + \dots + s_n}{n+1} \;=\; \begin{cases} \dfrac{1}{n+1} & n \text{ even},\\[4pt] 0 & n \text{ odd},\end{cases}$$

so the first few values are

$$\sigma_0 = 1,\quad \sigma_1 = 0,\quad \sigma_2 = \tfrac13,\quad \sigma_3 = 0,\quad \sigma_4 = \tfrac15,\quad \sigma_5 = 0,\ \dots$$

and $\lim_n \sigma_n = 0$, while $(s_k)$ does not converge at all. So $(s_k)$ is
$(C,1)$-summable to $0$ and divergent: it is the standard witness that
$(C,1)$-summability is strictly weaker than convergence, and the one used in
[[fs-cesaro-converse]].

The value $0$ is the one an average ought to give, since the sequence spends
half its indices at $1$ and half at $-1$; the classical way to say this is that
the series $1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + \dots$ has Cesaro sum $\tfrac12$, that being the
Cesaro limit of its partial sums rather than of its terms.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The alternating sequence $(s_k)$ with $s_0 = 1$ and $s_{\sigma(k)} = -s_k$, its partial sums $S_n = \sum_{k<n} s_k$, and its Cesaro means $\sigma_n = (n+1)^{-1}S_{n+1}$.

[L1] The alternating sequence and its index maps $e$ (even indices) and $o$ (odd indices), with $\mathbb{N}$ the disjoint union of their ranges and $s_{e_j} = 1$, $s_{o_j} = -1$ ([[lem-alternating-sequence]]).

[L2] Its partial sums satisfy $S_{e_j} = 0$ and $S_{o_j} = 1$, and consequently $|\sigma_n| \le (n+1)^{-1}$ and $\sigma_n \to 0$; this is proved in [[fs-cesaro-converse]], steps 2.1, 3.1, 4.1 and 5.1 there.

[L3] $(s_k)$ is bounded and does not converge ([[fs-bounded-implies-convergent]]).

[L4] The Cesaro means and $(C,1)$-summability ([[def-cesaro-mean]], [[def-finite-sum]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L5] Convergence of a real sequence ([[def-real-limit]]); the reciprocal Archimedean property ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]]).

[L6] Order arithmetic: $(n+1)\cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} > 0$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]) hence invertible with positive inverse, and reciprocation reverses the order ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]); $|u| = u$ for $u \ge 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]); the order is total ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Verification

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $S_m = 0$ when $m$ is even and $S_m = 1$ when $m$ is odd, since $\mathbb{N}$ is the disjoint union of the ranges of $e$ and $o$ and $S_{e_j} = 0$, $S_{o_j} = 1$. [L1, L2]

1.2 $(s_k)$ does not converge. [L3]

2.1 Hence $\sigma_n = (n+1)^{-1}S_{n+1}$ equals $(n+1)^{-1}$ when $n$ is even, because $n+1$ is then odd, and equals $0$ when $n$ is odd; in particular $\sigma_0 = 1$, $\sigma_1 = 0$, $\sigma_2 = 1/3$, $\sigma_3 = 0$, $\sigma_4 = 1/5$ and $\sigma_5 = 0$. [step 1.1, L4, L6]

2.2 $|\sigma_n| \le (n+1)^{-1}$ for every $n$, and given a real $\varepsilon > 0$ a natural $m \ge 1$ with $1/m < \varepsilon$ gives $|\sigma_n| \le (n+1)^{-1} < \varepsilon$ for all $n \ge m$; so $\lim_n \sigma_n = 0$. [step 1.1, L2, L5, L6]

3.1 $(s_k)$ is therefore $(C,1)$-summable to $0$ and divergent. [step 1.2, step 2.1, step 2.2, L4] ∎

## Remarks

- **The means converge but are not monotone**, and they are not even eventually
  of one shape: they alternate between $0$ and a positive value shrinking like
  $1/(n+1)$. Convergence of a Cesaro transform therefore carries no monotonicity
  information, which is another way of seeing that the transform loses the
  oscillation rather than damping it.

- **Where the $1/2$ comes from.** The classical assertion "$1 - 1 + 1 - 1 +
  \dots = 1/2$" is about the *partial sums* $S_m$, which are $0, 1, 0, 1,
  \dots$; their Cesaro means tend to $1/2$. This library has no theory of series
  yet, so nothing above asserts it; the sequence averaged here is $(s_k)$
  itself, whose means tend to $0$.

- **This is not a failure of the Cesaro matrix.** That matrix is regular
  ([[cor-cesaro-matrix-is-regular]]): it never changes a limit that exists. What
  it does here is assign a value where no limit exists, which is exactly what a
  summability method is for.

## Statement

**False claim:** every bounded sequence of reals converges
([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]).

The implication in the opposite direction is true and is
[[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]]: every convergent sequence is bounded. The
claim above asserts the converse. It is refuted by the alternating sequence
$(s_k)$ and the index map defined by $n_0 = 0$ and
$n_{\sigma(j)} = \sigma(\sigma(n_j))$: the refutation proves that $n$ is
strictly increasing, $s_{n_j} = 1$ for every $j$, and $(s_k)$ does not
converge.

The sequence usually written $x_k = (-1)^k$ is introduced here by recursion
([[thm-recursion]]), as the unique $(s_k)$ with $s_0 = 1$ and
$s_{\sigma(k)} = -s_k$. That is the same sequence under a different presentation,
and it is chosen because the three inductions of the refutation read straight off
those two recursion equations, whereas the power notation would first have to be
unwound into them.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** By the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) applied to the set $\mathbb{R}$, the element $1$ and the function $u \mapsto -u$, there is a unique sequence $(s_k)$ of reals with $s_0 = 1$ and $s_{\sigma(k)} = -s_k$ for every $k$. Applied to the set $\mathbb{N}$, the element $0$ and the function $i \mapsto \sigma(\sigma(i))$, it gives a unique $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ with $n_0 = 0$ and $n_{\sigma(j)} = \sigma(\sigma(n_j))$; applied to $\mathbb{N}$, the element $\sigma(0) = 1$ and the same function, it gives a unique $m : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ with $m_0 = \sigma(0)$ and $m_{\sigma(j)} = \sigma(\sigma(m_j))$ ([[def-natural-numbers]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L1] For any set $A$, any $a \in A$ and any $f : A \to A$ there is a unique $g : \mathbb{N} \to A$ with $g(0) = a$ and $g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n))$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-recursion]]); and if $P(0)$ holds and $P(n)$ implies $P(\sigma(n))$ for every $n$, then $P(n)$ holds for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L2] Absolute value and field arithmetic: $|-u| = |u|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]); $|1| = 1$, because $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]) and $|v| = v$ whenever $v \ge 0$ by the definition of the absolute value ([[def-real-order]], [[def-abs-value]]); and $-(-u) = u$ ([[def-field]]).

[L3] Order in $\mathbb{R}$: $0 < 1$, sums of positives are positive, and adding a constant preserves the order, so $1 - (-1) = 1 + 1 > 0$ and hence $-1 < 1$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L4] Order on $\mathbb{N}$: $i < \sigma(i)$ for every $i$, because $\sigma(i) = i + 1$ and $\sigma(i) \ne i$; and the order is transitive ([[def-nat-order]], [[def-nat-addition]], [[lem-nat-successor-neq-self]], [[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

[L5] If $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ satisfies $n_i < n_{\sigma(i)}$ for every $i \in \mathbb{N}$, then $n$ is strictly increasing (claim 1 of [[lem-index-map-grows]]).

[L6] Convergence, and the fact that a constant sequence converges to its value ([[def-real-limit]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L7] Divergence test: a sequence with two subsequences converging to different limits does not converge ([[lem-subsequence-inherits-limit]]).

[L8] $(x_k)$ is bounded if there is $M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-sequence]]).

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By induction, $|s_k| = 1$ for every $k$: the base case is $|s_0| = |1| = 1$, and if $|s_k| = 1$ then $|s_{\sigma(k)}| = |-s_k| = |s_k| = 1$. Hence $|s_k| \le 1$ for every $k$, so $(s_k)$ is bounded. [L1, L2, L8]

1.2 By induction, $s_{n_j} = 1$ for every $j$: the base case is $s_{n_0} = s_0 = 1$, and if $s_{n_j} = 1$ then $s_{n_{\sigma(j)}} = s_{\sigma(\sigma(n_j))} = -s_{\sigma(n_j)} = -(-s_{n_j}) = s_{n_j} = 1$. [L1, L2]

1.3 By induction, $s_{m_j} = -1$ for every $j$: the base case is $s_{m_0} = s_{\sigma(0)} = -s_0 = -1$, and if $s_{m_j} = -1$ then $s_{m_{\sigma(j)}} = s_{\sigma(\sigma(m_j))} = -(-s_{m_j}) = s_{m_j} = -1$. [L1, L2]

1.4 Both $n$ and $m$ are strictly increasing: for every $j$ we have $n_j < \sigma(n_j) < \sigma(\sigma(n_j)) = n_{\sigma(j)}$ by [L4], and likewise $m_j < m_{\sigma(j)}$, so [L5] applies to each. [L1, L4, L5]

1.5 The reals $1$ and $-1$ are distinct, since $1 - (-1) = 1 + 1 > 0$. [L3]

2.1 By step 1.4 the maps $n$ and $m$ define subsequences $(s_{n_j})_j$ and $(s_{m_j})_j$ of $(s_k)$; by steps 1.2 and 1.3 these are the constant sequences $1$ and $-1$, so they converge to $1$ and to $-1$ respectively, and by step 1.5 those two limits differ. [step 1.2, step 1.3, step 1.4, step 1.5, L6, L8]

3.1 By the divergence test, $(s_k)$ does not converge. [step 2.1, L7]

4.1 So $(s_k)$ is a bounded sequence of reals that does not converge, by steps 1.1 and 3.1; the claim that every bounded sequence converges is therefore false. [step 1.1, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- The refutation is self-contained: the witness is constructed by recursion, its boundedness and its two subsequential limits are each proved by induction, and the failure of convergence comes from the divergence test of [[lem-subsequence-inherits-limit]] together with uniqueness of limits ([[lem-limit-unique]]).

- **What is true in this direction** is the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem: every bounded sequence of reals has a convergent *subsequence*. That is a genuine theorem and it needs the least-upper-bound property. It is **not available at this point in the reading order**: it is the subject of the next page of this track, *Monotone Sequences, Bolzano-Weierstrass, and Cauchy Completeness*, where it is proved. It is named here only to say what the correct statement is; nothing above uses it, and no item available here may be cited for it. The false claim above is what one gets by deleting the word "subsequence" from it.

- The error is tempting because boundedness feels like "no room to escape". It is not: boundedness forbids running away, but it does not forbid oscillating forever, and oscillation is exactly what $(s_k)$ does.

- The same witness refutes [[fs-subsequence-convergence-implies-convergence]], and it is the sequence referred to in the remarks of [[lem-limit-abs]].

## Statement

**False claim:** if the Cesaro means $(\sigma_n)$ of a sequence $(x_k)$ of reals
converge ([[def-cesaro-mean]]), then $(x_k)$ converges.

The implication in the opposite direction is true and is
[[thm-cesaro-mean-theorem]]. The claim above asserts its converse, and it is
refuted below by the alternating sequence $s_k = (-1)^k$, whose Cesaro means
converge to $0$ while the sequence itself does not converge at all.

That is the whole reason Cesaro summability is worth defining: it is a strictly
larger notion than convergence, consistent with it where both apply.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The alternating sequence $(s_k)$ of [[lem-alternating-sequence]], the unique sequence of reals with $s_0 = 1$ and $s_{\sigma(k)} = -s_k$, together with the index maps $e$ and $o$ of that lemma; and its partial sums $S_n := \sum_{k<n} s_k$ ([[def-finite-sum]]), and its Cesaro means $\sigma_n = (n+1)^{-1}S_{n+1}$ ([[def-cesaro-mean]]).

[L1] The alternating sequence: $e$ and $o$ are the unique maps with $e_0 = 0$, $e_{\sigma(j)} = \sigma(\sigma(e_j))$, $o_0 = \sigma(0)$, $o_{\sigma(j)} = \sigma(\sigma(o_j))$; both are strictly increasing; $\mathbb{N}$ is the disjoint union of their ranges; $(s_k)$ is the unique sequence with $s_0 = 1$ and $s_{\sigma(k)} = -s_k$; $|s_k| = 1$, $s_{e_j} = 1$ and $s_{o_j} = -1$ ([[lem-alternating-sequence]]).

[L2] Finite sums: $\sum_{k<0} s_k = 0$ and $\sum_{k<n+1} s_k = \sum_{k<n} s_k + s_n$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L3] Induction principle ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L4] Cesaro means: $\sigma_n = (n+1)^{-1}\sum_{k=0}^{n}x_k$, and $\sum_{k=0}^{n} = \sum_{k<n+1}$ ([[def-cesaro-mean]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[L5] The alternating sequence does not converge: it is bounded and divergent, which is the refutation of [[fs-bounded-implies-convergent]], carried out there for the very same sequence, the one determined by $s_0 = 1$ and $s_{\sigma(k)} = -s_k$, which [[lem-alternating-sequence]] shows is unique.

[L6] Reciprocal Archimedean property ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]]); convergence of a real sequence ([[def-real-limit]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L7] Order arithmetic: $(n+1)\cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} > 0$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]) hence invertible with positive inverse, and reciprocation reverses the order ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]); $|u| = u$ for $u \ge 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]); the order is total and transitive ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By induction on $j$, $o_j = \sigma(e_j)$ and $e_{\sigma(j)} = \sigma(o_j)$: at $j = 0$ one has $o_0 = \sigma(0) = \sigma(e_0)$, and $e_{\sigma(j)} = \sigma(\sigma(e_j)) = \sigma(o_j)$ follows from the first identity at $j$, while $o_{\sigma(j)} = \sigma(\sigma(o_j)) = \sigma(e_{\sigma(j)})$ carries the first identity to $\sigma(j)$. [L1, L3]

1.2 The partial sums satisfy $S_0 = 0$ and $S_{\sigma(n)} = S_n + s_n$, and $\sigma_n = (n+1)^{-1}S_{\sigma(n)}$. [L2, L4, L7]

1.3 $(s_k)$ does not converge. [L5]

2.1 By induction on $j$: $S_{e_j} = 0$ and $S_{o_j} = 1$. At $j = 0$: $S_{e_0} = S_0 = 0$ and $S_{o_0} = S_{\sigma(0)} = S_0 + s_0 = 1$. For the step, $S_{e_{\sigma(j)}} = S_{\sigma(o_j)} = S_{o_j} + s_{o_j} = 1 + (-1) = 0$ and $S_{o_{\sigma(j)}} = S_{\sigma(e_{\sigma(j)})} = S_{e_{\sigma(j)}} + s_{e_{\sigma(j)}} = 0 + 1 = 1$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1, L3]

3.1 Every natural number is $e_j$ for exactly one $j$ or $o_j$ for exactly one $j$, so $S_m \in \{0,1\}$ for every $m$; in particular $0 \le S_{\sigma(n)} \le 1$ for every $n$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L1]

4.1 Hence $0 \le \sigma_n = (n+1)^{-1}S_{\sigma(n)} \le (n+1)^{-1}$ and so $|\sigma_n| \le (n+1)^{-1}$ for every $n$. [step 1.2, step 3.1, L7]

5.1 Given a real $\varepsilon > 0$, choose $m \ge 1$ with $1/m < \varepsilon$; for every $n \ge m$ one has $n+1 > m$ and therefore $|\sigma_n - 0| \le (n+1)^{-1} < 1/m < \varepsilon$. So $(\sigma_n)$ converges to $0$, that is, $(s_k)$ is $(C,1)$-summable to $0$. [step 4.1, L4, L6, L7]

6.1 So $(s_k)$ has convergent Cesaro means and does not converge, and the claim is false. [step 1.3, step 5.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **What averaging destroys.** The Cesaro mean of the first $n+1$ terms of an
  alternating sequence is either $0$ or $1/(n+1)$, because the terms cancel in
  pairs and at most one is left over. The oscillation is real and is not damped
  by any tail condition; it is simply invisible to the average. So the transform
  loses information, and no regular summability method can be expected to
  recover a limit that does not exist ([[cor-cesaro-matrix-is-regular]]).

- **The worked computation** of the means, with the values displayed, is
  [[ex-cesaro-means-of-alternating]].

- **A correct converse needs an extra hypothesis.** The classical one is
  Tauberian: if the Cesaro means converge and in addition $k(x_k - x_{k-1})$ is
  bounded, then $(x_k)$ converges. No such theorem is proved in this library,
  and none may be cited from it; the statement is mentioned only to say what the
  repaired claim would look like.

- **The failure is not caused by unboundedness.** The witness is bounded, with
  $|s_k| = 1$ at every index. It is the same sequence that refutes the claim
  that bounded sequences converge ([[fs-bounded-implies-convergent]]), and for
  the same underlying reason: boundedness forbids escaping, not oscillating.

## Statement

Let $\sigma$ be the successor on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]). There are
functions $e, o : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ and a sequence $(s_k)$ of reals
([[def-sequence]]) with the following properties.

1. **The index maps.** $e$ is the unique function with
   $e_0 = 0$ and $e_{\sigma(j)} = \sigma(\sigma(e_j))$, and $o$ the unique
   function with $o_0 = \sigma(0)$ and $o_{\sigma(j)} = \sigma(\sigma(o_j))$.
   Both are **strictly increasing**.
2. **The partition.** $\mathbb{N}$ is the **disjoint union** of the ranges of $e$
   and of $o$: every natural number is $e_i$ for exactly one $i$ or $o_i$ for
   exactly one $i$, and never both.
3. **The alternating sequence.** $(s_k)$ is the **unique** sequence of reals with
   $$s_0 = 1, \qquad s_{\sigma(k)} = -s_k \quad (k \in \mathbb{N}).$$
4. **Its values.** $|s_k| = 1$ for every $k$, so $(s_k)$ is bounded; and
   $$s_{e_j} = 1, \qquad s_{o_j} = -1 \qquad (j \in \mathbb{N}),$$
   that is $s \circ e$ is constantly $1$ and $s \circ o$ constantly $-1$.

This is the sequence usually written $s_k = (-1)^k$, with $e_j = 2j$ and
$o_j = 2j+1$, presented by the recursions that its proofs actually use. It is
collected here once because three separate items on this page and its companion
need an alternating or interleaved witness, and rebuilding the recursion inside
each of them is what this lemma exists to prevent.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** By the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) applied to the set $\mathbb{R}$, the element $1$ and the function $u \mapsto -u$, the unique sequence $(s_k)$ of reals with $s_0 = 1$ and $s_{\sigma(k)} = -s_k$; applied to the set $\mathbb{N}$, the element $0$ and the function $i \mapsto \sigma(\sigma(i))$, the unique $e : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ with $e_0 = 0$ and $e_{\sigma(j)} = \sigma(\sigma(e_j))$; and applied to $\mathbb{N}$, the element $\sigma(0)$ and the same function, the unique $o : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ with $o_0 = \sigma(0)$ and $o_{\sigma(j)} = \sigma(\sigma(o_j))$ ([[def-natural-numbers]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L1] Recursion theorem, including its uniqueness clause ([[thm-recursion]]).

[L2] Induction principle ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L3] Order on $\mathbb{N}$: $i < \sigma(i)$ for every $i$, since $\sigma(i) = i + 1$ gives $i \le \sigma(i)$ and $\sigma(i) \ne i$; and the order is transitive and total ([[def-nat-order]], [[def-nat-addition]], [[lem-nat-successor-neq-self]], [[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

[L4] Consecutive comparisons suffice: if $n_i < n_{\sigma(i)}$ for every $i$ then $n$ is strictly increasing ([[lem-index-map-grows]]).

[L5] Absolute value and field arithmetic: $|-u| = |u|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]); $|v| = v$ whenever $v \ge 0$ ([[def-abs-value]], [[def-real-order]]); and $-(-u) = u$ ([[def-field]]).

[L6] Order in $\mathbb{R}$: $0 < 1$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]), sums of positives are positive and adding a constant preserves the order ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]), so $1 - (-1) = 1 + 1 > 0$ and hence $-1 < 1$; in particular $1 \ne -1$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case for claim 4: $|s_0| = |1| = 1$, since $1 > 0$ makes $|1| = 1$. [given, L5, L6, base]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume $|s_k| = 1$. [ih]

1.3 Both index maps satisfy consecutive strict comparisons: $e_j < \sigma(e_j) < \sigma(\sigma(e_j)) = e_{\sigma(j)}$, and likewise $o_j < o_{\sigma(j)}$, so $e$ and $o$ are strictly increasing and claim 1 holds, its uniqueness part being the uniqueness clause of the recursion theorem. [given, L1, L3, L4]

1.4 By induction, $s_{e_j} = 1$ for every $j$: the base case is $s_{e_0} = s_0 = 1$, and if $s_{e_j} = 1$ then $s_{e_{\sigma(j)}} = s_{\sigma(\sigma(e_j))} = -s_{\sigma(e_j)} = -(-s_{e_j}) = s_{e_j} = 1$. [given, L1, L2, L5]

1.5 By induction, $s_{o_j} = -1$ for every $j$: the base case is $s_{o_0} = s_{\sigma(0)} = -s_0 = -1$, and if $s_{o_j} = -1$ then $s_{o_{\sigma(j)}} = s_{\sigma(\sigma(o_j))} = -(-s_{o_j}) = s_{o_j} = -1$. [given, L1, L2, L5]

1.6 By induction on $n$, every natural number satisfies: either $n = e_i$ and $\sigma(n) = o_i$ for some $i$, or $n = o_i$ and $\sigma(n) = e_{\sigma(i)}$ for some $i$. The base case is $0 = e_0$ with $\sigma(0) = o_0$. For the successor step, if $n = e_i$ and $\sigma(n) = o_i$ then $\sigma(n) = o_i$ and $\sigma(\sigma(n)) = \sigma(\sigma(e_i)) = e_{\sigma(i)}$, which is the second alternative at $\sigma(n)$; and if $n = o_i$ and $\sigma(n) = e_{\sigma(i)}$ then $\sigma(n) = e_{\sigma(i)}$ and $\sigma(\sigma(n)) = \sigma(\sigma(o_i)) = o_{\sigma(i)}$, which is the first alternative at $\sigma(n)$. [given, L1, L2]

1.7 The sequence $(s_k)$ is the unique sequence of reals with $s_0 = 1$ and $s_{\sigma(k)} = -s_k$, by the uniqueness clause of the recursion theorem: this is claim 3. [given, L1]

2.1 Successor step for claim 4: $|s_{\sigma(k)}| = |-s_k| = |s_k| = 1$. [step 1.2, L5]

2.2 In particular every natural number lies in the range of $e$ or in the range of $o$, since each alternative of step 1.6 exhibits $n$ as such a value. [step 1.6]

2.3 The two ranges are disjoint: if $e_i = o_j$ for some $i, j$ then $1 = s_{e_i} = s_{o_j} = -1$, contradicting $1 \ne -1$. [step 1.4, step 1.5, L6]

2.4 Each of $e$ and $o$ is injective, being strictly increasing, so a natural number in the range of $e$ is $e_i$ for exactly one $i$, and likewise for $o$. [step 1.3, L3]

3.1 By the induction principle, $|s_k| = 1$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$; hence $|s_k| \le 1$ at every index and $(s_k)$ is bounded. Together with steps 1.4 and 1.5 this is claim 4. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 1.4, step 1.5, L2]

4.1 Claim 2 follows: by step 2.2 every natural is in one of the two ranges, by step 2.3 not in both, and by step 2.4 the index realising it is unique. Claims 1, 2, 3 and 4 are therefore all established. [step 2.2, step 2.3, step 3.1, step 2.4, step 1.3, step 1.7, discharge-induction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the recursion rather than $(-1)^k$.** Written as a power, every one of the
  four claims would have to be unwound into the two recursion equations before it
  could be proved; written as a recursion, each is a two-line induction. The
  identification with $(-1)^k$ is available ([[def-integer-power]]) and is used
  nowhere.

- **The parity statement is genuinely proved, not assumed.** Claim 2 is where the
  work is: the covering half is the interleaved induction of step 1.6, which
  tracks $n$ and $\sigma(n)$ together because neither alone is preserved by the
  successor, and the disjointness half is settled by the *sequence*, since
  $s$ takes the value $1$ on one range and $-1$ on the other and $1 \ne -1$.
  Using the sequence to separate the two ranges is shorter than any direct parity
  argument and needs no arithmetic on $\mathbb{N}$ beyond the successor.

- **What consumes this lemma.** [[fs-convergent-subsequence-implies-bounded]]
  interleaves a constant sequence with an unbounded one along $e$ and $o$;
  [[ex-two-subsequential-limits]] multiplies $s$ by a null perturbation to get a
  sequence with exactly two subsequential limits; and
  [[cex-unbounded-with-convergent-subsequence]] is the witness for the first of
  those. The same sequence, built inline, refutes
  [[fs-bounded-implies-convergent]] on the previous page; that item predates this
  lemma and is left as it stands.

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]), let $x \in \mathbb{R}$,
and for $K \in \mathbb{N}$ let $x^{(K)}$ denote the $K$-th tail, $x^{(K)}_j =
x_{j+K}$. The following are equivalent ([[def-real-limit]]):

1. $(x_k)$ converges to $x$;
2. every tail $x^{(K)}$ converges to $x$;
3. some tail $x^{(K)}$ converges to $x$.

The same three statements with "converges to $x$" replaced by "is Cauchy" are
likewise equivalent. Consequently, if two sequences agree from some index on,
then either both converge to $x$ or neither does, and either both are Cauchy or
neither is.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals, a real $x$, and for each $K \in \mathbb{N}$ the $K$-th tail $x^{(K)}$ defined by $x^{(K)}_j := x_{j+K}$ ([[def-sequence]]).

[L1] Convergence and the Cauchy condition: $(z_k)$ converges to $z$ when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $N$ with $|z_k - z| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge N$, and $(z_k)$ is Cauchy when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $N$ with $|z_k - z_l| < \varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge N$ ([[def-real-limit]]).

[L2] Index arithmetic, first half: $j \ge N$ implies $j + K \ge N + K$, and $N + K \ge N$ ([[def-nat-order]], [[lem-nat-order-add-compatible]]).

[L3] Index arithmetic, second half: every $k \ge N + K$ has the form $k = j + K$ with $j \ge N$. Indeed $N + K \le k$ gives $i$ with $(N+K) + i = k$; put $j := N + i$, so that $j \ge N$ and $j + K = (N+i) + K = N + (i + K) = N + (K + i) = (N+K) + i = k$ ([[def-nat-order]], [[lem-nat-add-associative]], [[lem-nat-add-commutative]]).

[L4] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is reflexive and transitive, so $k \ge N + K \ge N$ gives $k \ge N$; and $j + 0 = j$ for every $j$ ([[thm-nat-linear-order]], [[def-nat-order]], [[def-nat-addition]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 (1) implies (2). Assume $(x_k)$ converges to $x$, let $K \in \mathbb{N}$ be arbitrary and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be rational; take $N$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge N$. For every $j \ge N$ we have $j + K \ge N + K \ge N$, hence $|x^{(K)}_j - x| = |x_{j+K} - x| < \varepsilon$; so $x^{(K)}$ converges to $x$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2, L4]

1.2 (2) implies (3), in both families. The $0$-th tail satisfies $x^{(0)}_j = x_{j+0} = x_j$, so $(x_k)$ is itself one of its own tails; statement (2) quantifies over all tails, so applying it to this one already yields (3). [given, L4]

1.3 (3) implies (1). Assume $x^{(K)}$ converges to $x$ for some fixed $K$, and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be rational; take $N$ with $|x^{(K)}_j - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $j \ge N$. Every $k \ge N + K$ is of the form $j + K$ with $j \ge N$, so $|x_k - x| = |x^{(K)}_j - x| < \varepsilon$; taking $N + K$ as the threshold shows $(x_k)$ converges to $x$. [assume-hyp, L1, L3]

1.4 The Cauchy version of (1) implies (2). Assume $(x_k)$ is Cauchy, fix $K$ and a rational $\varepsilon > 0$, and take $N$ with $|x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge N$. For $i, j \ge N$ both $i + K \ge N$ and $j + K \ge N$, so $|x^{(K)}_i - x^{(K)}_j| = |x_{i+K} - x_{j+K}| < \varepsilon$; so $x^{(K)}$ is Cauchy. [assume-hyp, L1, L2, L4]

1.5 The Cauchy version of (3) implies (1). Assume $x^{(K)}$ is Cauchy and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be rational; take $N$ with $|x^{(K)}_i - x^{(K)}_j| < \varepsilon$ for all $i, j \ge N$. Any $k, l \ge N + K$ are of the form $i + K$ and $j + K$ with $i, j \ge N$, so $|x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon$; so $(x_k)$ is Cauchy. [assume-hyp, L1, L3]

2.1 In each of the two families the cycle (1) implies (2) implies (3) implies (1) is closed, so within each family the three statements are equivalent. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, step 1.4, step 1.5]

3.1 If $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ agree from index $K$ on, then $x^{(K)} = y^{(K)}$ as functions, so by the established equivalence $(x_k)$ converges to $x$ exactly when $y^{(K)}$ does, exactly when $(y_k)$ does, and the same chain applies to the Cauchy condition. [step 2.1, given] ∎

## Remarks

- This is the lemma that makes the word "eventually" usable. Once it is known that finitely many initial terms are irrelevant, a hypothesis of the form "$P(k)$ for all $k$" can everywhere be weakened to "$P(k)$ eventually" ([[def-sequence]]) at the cost of passing to a tail.

- It also settles the bookkeeping question of where the indexing starts. A text that writes $(x_k)_{k \ge 1}$ is describing the first tail of a sequence in the sense used here, and the two have the same limits and the same Cauchy status.

- Boundedness, by contrast, is *not* a tail property in the same trivial way: a tail of a bounded sequence is bounded, and a sequence with a bounded tail is bounded only because the finitely many omitted terms can be absorbed into the bound, which is exactly the argument of [[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]].

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]) and let $x, y \in
\mathbb{R}$. If $(x_k)$ converges to $x$ and $(x_k)$ converges to $y$
([[def-real-limit]]), then $x = y$. A sequence therefore has at most one limit,
and when a limit exists it may be denoted $\lim_{k} x_k$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals and reals $x, y$ such that $(x_k)$ converges to $x$ and $(x_k)$ converges to $y$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L1] Convergence: $(x_k)$ converges to $z$ when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_k - z| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$ ([[def-real-limit]]).

[L2] Triangle inequality: $|a + b| \le |a| + |b|$ in any ordered field, in particular in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Absolute value: $|u| \ge 0$, and $|u| = 0$ if and only if $u = 0$, and $|-u| = |u|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L4] Small rationals: for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$. Either route gives this: density of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) applied to the pair $0 < \eta$; or the Archimedean property ([[thm-of-archimedean]]) applied to $1/\eta$, which yields a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/\eta < n$ and hence $0 < 1/n < \eta$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

[L5] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$. Trichotomy, so $u \ne 0$ together with $|u| \ge 0$ and $|u| \ne 0$ forces $|u| > 0$; transitivity and irreflexivity of $<$; and, since $u \le v$ means $u < v$ or $u = v$, the mixed form $u \le v < w \Rightarrow u < w$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]). Adding two strict inequalities: $a < b$ and $c < d$ give $a + c < b + d$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]). Multiplying by a positive: for $c > 0$, $a < b$ gives $ac < bc$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]). Halving a positive: $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]), so $2 := 1 + 1 > 0$ because the positives are closed under addition ([[def-ordered-field]]), hence $2^{-1} > 0$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]) and $\eta/2 = \eta \cdot 2^{-1} > 0$ whenever $\eta > 0$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

[L6] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total, so any two indices $K_1, K_2$ admit an index $k$ with $k \ge K_1$ and $k \ge K_2$ ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $x \ne y$. [assume-contra]

2.1 Then $x - y \ne 0$, so $|x - y| \ne 0$ while $|x - y| \ge 0$; by trichotomy $|x - y| > 0$, and hence $|x - y|/2 > 0$. [step 1.1, L3, L5]

3.1 Choose a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < |x - y|/2$; multiplying that inequality by $2 > 0$ and using $(|x - y|/2) \cdot 2 = |x - y|$ gives $2\varepsilon < |x - y|$. [step 2.1, L4, L5, algebra, choose]

4.1 Since $(x_k)$ converges to $x$ there is $K_1$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K_1$, and since $(x_k)$ converges to $y$ there is $K_2$ with $|x_k - y| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K_2$. [step 3.1, L1]

5.1 Fix an index $k$ with $k \ge K_1$ and $k \ge K_2$; then $|x - y| = |(x - x_k) + (x_k - y)| \le |x - x_k| + |x_k - y| = |x_k - x| + |x_k - y|$, while adding the two strict inequalities of step 4.1 gives $|x_k - x| + |x_k - y| < \varepsilon + \varepsilon = 2\varepsilon$; composing the non-strict inequality with the strict one yields $|x - y| < 2\varepsilon$. [step 4.1, L2, L3, L5, L6]

6.1 Combining, $2\varepsilon < |x - y| < 2\varepsilon$, so $2\varepsilon < 2\varepsilon$, which contradicts irreflexivity of the strict order. [step 3.1, step 5.1, L5]

7.1 The assumption $x \ne y$ is therefore untenable, so $x = y$: a sequence of reals has at most one limit. [step 6.1, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- Uniqueness is what licenses the notation $\lim_{k} x_k$ and the phrase *the* limit. Without it the symbol would not denote. This library writes $\lim_k x_k$ only for sequences already known to converge, exactly as it writes $\sup S$ only for sets already known to have a supremum ([[rem-sup-conventions]]).

- The proof uses only that $\mathbb{R}$ is an ordered field in which arbitrarily small positive rationals exist, that is, an Archimedean ordered field ([[thm-of-archimedean]]). Completeness is not needed: limits are unique in $\mathbb{Q}$ too, where many sequences fail to have one.

- The hypothesis is genuinely about a single sequence having two limits. Two *different* sequences may of course share a limit, and a sequence with no limit at all is not excluded by anything here.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| = u$ if $u \ge 0$, and $|u| = -u$ if $u < 0$ ([[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Ordered-field order: trichotomy holds (for each $u$ exactly one of $u > 0$, $u = 0$, $u < 0$), $a < b$ means $b - a$ is positive, and sums and products of positives are positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Signs in products: $(-a)b = -(ab)$ and $(-a)(-b) = ab$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] Sign rules: a product of two elements of the same sign is positive, and a product of two elements of opposite sign is negative ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Case $x > 0$: by [L1] $|x| = x > 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; since $-x < 0$ we get $|-x| = -(-x) = x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -x < 0 < x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case pos, L1, L2, algebra]

1.2 Case $x = 0$: then $|x| = |0| = 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ holds with $|x| = 0$ and $x = 0$, while $|-x| = |0| = |x|$ and $-|x| = 0 \le 0 \le 0 = |x|$. [assume-case zero, L1]

1.3 Case $x < 0$: by [L1] $|x| = -x$, and [L2] gives $-x > 0$, so $|x| > 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; here $|-x| = -x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -(-x) = x \le x$ while $x < 0 < -x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case neg, L1, L2, algebra]

1.4 Case $x = 0$ or $y = 0$: then $xy = 0$, so $|xy| = 0$, and one of $|x|, |y|$ is $0$, whence $|x|\,|y| = 0 = |xy|$. [assume-case zerofactor, L1]

1.5 Case $x, y$ have the same sign (both positive or both negative): by [L4] $xy > 0$, so $|xy| = xy$, while $|x|\,|y| = xy$ by [L3] (for $x, y < 0$ this is $(-x)(-y) = xy$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case same, L1, L3, L4]

1.6 Case $x, y$ have opposite signs (one positive, one negative): by [L4] $xy < 0$, so $|xy| = -(xy)$, while $|x|\,|y| = -(xy)$ by [L3] (namely $x(-y)$ or $(-x)y$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case opposite, L1, L3, L4]

2.1 By trichotomy [L2] each $x$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.1-1.3, and in each we verified $|x| \ge 0$, that $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$, that $|-x| = |x|$, and that $-|x| \le x \le |x|$; hence all four hold for every $x$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, cases-exhaustive]

2.2 By trichotomy [L2] each pair $x, y$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.4-1.6, and in each $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$ for all $x, y$. [step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6, cases-exhaustive]

3.1 Let $c > 0$: if $|x| < c$ then $-c < -|x| \le x \le |x| < c$ by [step 2.1] and [L2], so $-c < x < c$; conversely if $-c < x < c$ then both $x < c$ and $-x < c$, and since $|x|$ equals $x$ or $-x$ by [L1], we get $|x| < c$, so $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$. [step 2.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b \in F$.

1. If $a > 0$ then $a^{-1} > 0$.
2. If $0 < a < b$ then $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b \in F$.

[L1] $x > 0 \iff x \in P$; $x < 0 \iff -x \in P$; and for $x \neq 0$ exactly one of $x \in P$, $-x \in P$ holds ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Sign rules: a product of a positive and a negative is negative, a product of two positives is positive, and for $c > 0$ one has $a < b \iff ac < bc$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

[L3] $0 < 1$; in particular $1 \neq 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L4] $P$ is closed under addition, so $<$ is transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a > 0$, so $a \neq 0$ and its inverse $a^{-1}$ exists with $a \cdot a^{-1} = 1$; moreover $a^{-1} \neq 0$, since $a^{-1}$ has $a$ as its inverse while $0$ is non-invertible ($1 \neq 0$ by L3). [assume-hyp, L1, L3]

2.1 By trichotomy $a^{-1} \in P$ or $-a^{-1} \in P$; if $-a^{-1} \in P$, then $a > 0$ and $a^{-1} < 0$ give $a \cdot a^{-1} < 0$ by the sign rules, i.e. $1 < 0$, contradicting $0 < 1$; hence $a^{-1} \in P$, i.e. $a^{-1} > 0$, proving claim 1. [step 1.1, L2, L3, L1]

3.1 Assume $0 < a < b$; then $0 < b$ by transitivity, so by claim 1 both $a^{-1} > 0$ and $b^{-1} > 0$, and the sign rules give $a^{-1} b^{-1} > 0$. [assume-hyp, step 2.1, L4, L2, L1]

4.1 Multiplying $a < b$ by the positive $a^{-1} b^{-1}$ via the sign rules gives $a (a^{-1} b^{-1}) < b (a^{-1} b^{-1})$; since $a a^{-1} = 1$ and $b b^{-1} = 1$, this simplifies to $b^{-1} < a^{-1}$. [step 3.1, L2, algebra]

5.1 Together with $b^{-1} > 0$ from step 3.1, we conclude $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$, proving claim 2. [step 3.1, step 4.1] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field, with field structure as in [[def-field]], and for
$n \ge 1$ let $n \cdot 1_F$ denote the canonical natural number
$\underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$, defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$
and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$. Then for every $n \ge 1$:

- $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$;
- the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$;
- $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ and $(mn) \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F)$ for all $m, n \ge 1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ whose canonical naturals are defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, with $0 \cdot 1_F = 0$.

[L1] $0 < 1_F$ in every ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] The order is compatible with addition and positives are closed under addition: $a < b$ implies $a + c < b + c$, and $a > 0$, $b > 0$ imply $a + b > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 1$: by definition $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, and $1_F > 0$. [L1, base]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: assume $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for some fixed $n \ge 1$. [ih]

1.3 By the recursion, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F - n \cdot 1_F = 1_F > 0$, so $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$. [given, L1]

1.4 Additive identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ by the recursion, and if $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ then $(m+n+1) \cdot 1_F = (m+n) \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + (n+1) \cdot 1_F$. [given, algebra]

2.1 Inductive step: $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ is a sum of two positives, by the hypothesis and $1_F > 0$, hence $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Iterating 1.3, for $m < n$ one has $m \cdot 1_F < n \cdot 1_F$, so $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing and therefore injective on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$. [step 1.3, L2]

2.3 Multiplicative identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m \cdot 1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(1 \cdot 1_F)$, and the step $(m(n+1)) \cdot 1_F = (mn + m) \cdot 1_F = (mn) \cdot 1_F + m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F) + (m \cdot 1_F)(1_F) = (m \cdot 1_F)((n+1) \cdot 1_F)$ uses 1.4 and distributivity. [step 1.4, algebra]

3.1 By induction on 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for every $n \ge 1$; with the strict increase 2.2 and the identities 1.4, 2.3, every claim holds. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 1.4, step 2.3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ be sequences of reals ([[def-sequence]]) converging to
$x$ and $y$ respectively ([[def-real-limit]]), and let $c \in \mathbb{R}$. Then

$$x_k + y_k \to x + y, \qquad c\,x_k \to c\,x, \qquad x_k - y_k \to x - y, \qquad x_k y_k \to x y,$$

and if in addition $y \ne 0$ and $y_k \ne 0$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, then

$$\frac{1}{y_k} \to \frac{1}{y} \qquad \text{and} \qquad \frac{x_k}{y_k} \to \frac{x}{y}.$$

The quotient case rests on an eventual lower bound for $|y_k|$, proved below
rather than assumed: $|y_k| > |y|/2$ for all sufficiently large $k$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $(x_k)$, $(y_k)$ of reals with $(x_k)$ converging to $x$ and $(y_k)$ converging to $y$, and a real $c$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]). For the last two claims we assume in addition $y \ne 0$ and $y_k \ne 0$ for every $k$.

[L1] Convergence, quantified over rational $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-real-limit]]).

[L2] Absolute value and the triangle inequality: $|uv| = |u|\,|v|$, $|u| \ge 0$, $|u| = 0$ if and only if $u = 0$, $|-u| = |u|$, and $|a + b| \le |a| + |b|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L3] Real versus rational $\varepsilon$: for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, by density ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) or by the Archimedean property ([[thm-of-archimedean]]) applied to $1/\eta$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]); consequently the convergence test of [[def-real-limit]] may equivalently be run with real $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-sequence]]).

[L4] Convergent sequences are bounded ([[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]]), and a constant sequence $(c)$ is bounded by $|c|$ ([[def-sequence]]).

[L5] A null sequence times a bounded sequence is null ([[lem-null-times-bounded]]).

[L6] Reverse triangle inequality: $\bigl||u| - |v|\bigr| \le |u - v|$, hence $|u| \ge |v| - |v - u|$ ([[cor-of-reverse-triangle]]).

[L7] Inverses and order: $a > 0$ implies $a^{-1} > 0$; $0 < a < b$ implies $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$; $(u^{-1})^{-1} = u$ for $u \ne 0$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-field]]).

[L8] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: adding a constant and adding inequalities preserve the order, multiplying a strict inequality by a positive factor preserves it, and $\le$ and $<$ compose transitively; trichotomy holds, and since $u \ge 0$ means $u > 0$ or $u = 0$, an element with $u \ge 0$ and $u \ne 0$ satisfies $u > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]). Moreover $2 = 1 + 1 > 0$ and $2$ is invertible: $0 < 1$ in any ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]) and the positives are closed under addition, so $2 > 0$ and in particular $2 \ne 0$ ([[def-ordered-field]]), whence $2^{-1}$ exists ([[def-field]]).

[L9] Rational arithmetic: $\varepsilon/2$ is a rational $> 0$ whenever $\varepsilon$ is, and $\varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$ ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]); the order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total, so finitely many thresholds admit a common index ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Reduction to null sequences: for any sequence $(z_k)$ of reals and any real $z$, the statements "$(z_k)$ converges to $z$" and "$(z_k - z)$ converges to $0$" are literally the same condition, because $|(z_k - z) - 0| = |z_k - z|$ for every $k$. [L1, L2]

1.2 Sum rule, in general form. Let $(u_k) \to u$ and $(v_k) \to v$ be any convergent sequences of reals and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be rational; take $K_1$ with $|u_k - u| < \varepsilon/2$ for $k \ge K_1$ and $K_2$ with $|v_k - v| < \varepsilon/2$ for $k \ge K_2$, and let $K$ be an index at least as large as both. For $k \ge K$, $|(u_k + v_k) - (u + v)| = |(u_k - u) + (v_k - v)| \le |u_k - u| + |v_k - v| < \varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$; hence $u_k + v_k \to u + v$, and in particular $x_k + y_k \to x + y$. [L1, L2, L8, L9, algebra]

1.3 Boundedness: every convergent sequence of reals is bounded, and every constant sequence $(d)$ is bounded by $|d|$. [L4]

1.4 Quotient preparation. Assume $y \ne 0$ and $y_k \ne 0$ for every $k$. Then $|y| > 0$ by [L2], so $|y|/2 > 0$; running the convergence test of $(y_k)$ with the real number $|y|/2$ as tolerance, which [L3] licenses, produces $K_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|y_k - y| < |y|/2$ for all $k \ge K_0$. [L1, L2, L3, L7, L8, choose]

2.1 Scalar rule, in general form. Let $(u_k) \to u$ and let $d \in \mathbb{R}$. By step 1.1 the sequence $(u_k - u)$ is null and by step 1.3 the constant sequence $(d)$ is bounded, so $(d(u_k - u)) = (d u_k - d u)$ is null by [L5]; by step 1.1 again, $d u_k \to d u$, and in particular $c x_k \to c x$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, L5, algebra]

2.2 Product rule, in general form. Let $(u_k) \to u$ and $(v_k) \to v$, and write $u_k v_k - u v = u_k(v_k - v) + v(u_k - u)$. By step 1.1 both $(v_k - v)$ and $(u_k - u)$ are null; by step 1.3 both $(u_k)$ and the constant sequence $(v)$ are bounded; so both $(u_k(v_k - v))$ and $(v(u_k - u))$ are null by [L5], and their sum is null by step 1.2 applied with both limits equal to $0$. By step 1.1, $u_k v_k \to u v$, and in particular $x_k y_k \to x y$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, L5, algebra]

2.3 Eventual lower bound. For every $k \ge K_0$, the reverse triangle inequality gives $|y_k| \ge |y| - |y - y_k| = |y| - |y_k - y| > |y| - |y|/2 = |y|/2 > 0$; so $|y_k| > |y|/2$ for all $k \ge K_0$, and in particular $|y_k| \ne 0$ there. [step 1.4, L2, L6, L8]

3.1 Difference rule. Applying step 2.1 to the sequence $(y_k)$ with $d = -1$ gives $-y_k \to -y$; the sum rule of step 1.2 applied to $(x_k)$ and $(-y_k)$ then gives $x_k - y_k = x_k + (-y_k) \to x + (-y) = x - y$. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L8, algebra]

3.2 Reciprocal estimate. For $k \ge K_0$ we have $y_k \ne 0$ and $|y_k| > |y|/2 > 0$, so [L7] applied to $0 < |y|/2 < |y_k|$ gives $0 < |y_k|^{-1} < 2/|y|$, and therefore $\left|\dfrac{1}{y_k} - \dfrac{1}{y}\right| = \dfrac{|y - y_k|}{|y_k|\,|y|} \le \dfrac{2}{|y|^2}\,|y_k - y|$. [step 2.3, L2, L7, L8, algebra]

4.1 Reciprocal rule. Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real and put $\eta := \varepsilon |y|^2/2$, a real $> 0$; by [L3] there is $K_1$ with $|y_k - y| < \eta$ for all $k \ge K_1$. For every $k$ at least as large as both $K_0$ and $K_1$, step 3.2 gives $\left|\dfrac{1}{y_k} - \dfrac{1}{y}\right| \le \dfrac{2}{|y|^2}|y_k - y| < \dfrac{2}{|y|^2}\,\eta = \varepsilon$; hence $1/y_k \to 1/y$. [step 3.2, L1, L3, L7, L8, L9, algebra]

5.1 Quotient rule. By step 4.1 the sequence $(1/y_k)$ converges to $1/y$, so the product rule of step 2.2 applied to $(x_k)$ and $(1/y_k)$ gives $x_k/y_k = x_k \cdot (1/y_k) \to x \cdot (1/y) = x/y$. [step 2.2, step 4.1, algebra]

6.1 All the claims are established: the sum rule in step 1.2, the scalar rule in step 2.1, the difference rule in step 3.1, the product rule in step 2.2, and the reciprocal and quotient rules in steps 4.1 and 5.1. [step 1.2, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, step 4.1, step 5.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The quotient case is where proofs usually cheat.** The estimate $|1/y_k - 1/y| = |y - y_k| / (|y_k||y|)$ is worthless until $|y_k|$ is known to stay away from $0$: without a lower bound the denominator can be arbitrarily small and the fraction arbitrarily large, even while $|y - y_k|$ shrinks. Step 2.3 supplies that bound, $|y_k| > |y|/2$ for $k \ge K_0$, and it is proved from the reverse triangle inequality, not assumed.

- The hypothesis $y_k \ne 0$ for every $k$ is only there so that $1/y_k$ is defined for every index. It is not needed for the limit: step 2.3 shows $|y_k| > |y|/2 > 0$ from $K_0$ on, so a sequence with $y \ne 0$ has at most finitely many zero terms, and by [[lem-limit-of-tail]] one may pass to the $K_0$-th tail and read the conclusion there.

- The hypothesis $y \ne 0$ cannot be dropped. With $x_k = 1$ and $y_k = 1/(k+1)$, both sequences converge: the first is constant ([[def-sequence]]) and the second is null ([[fs-limit-preserves-strict-inequality]]), so $y = 0$. Yet $x_k/y_k = k+1$, and no real $M$ bounds every $k+1$, by the Archimedean property ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); so the quotient sequence is unbounded, hence not convergent by [[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]].

- Nothing in the proof uses completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ beyond the Archimedean property invoked in [L3], so the same rules hold verbatim for sequences of rationals.

## Statement

Every complete ordered field $F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) is Archimedean:
for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$,
where $n \cdot 1_F$ is the canonical natural of the ordered field $F$
([[def-ordered-field]]). Equivalently, the canonical naturals are cofinal in $F$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $F$; write $A = \{\, n \cdot 1_F : n \ge 1 \,\}$ for the set of its canonical naturals.

[L1] Least-upper-bound property: every nonempty $S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound $\sup S \in F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Each canonical natural satisfies $n \cdot 1_F > 0$, one has $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L3] $0 < 1_F$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $F$ is not Archimedean: there is some $x \in F$ with $n \cdot 1_F \le x$ for all $n \ge 1$, that is, $x$ is an upper bound of $A$. [assume-contra]

2.1 The set $A$ is nonempty, since $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F \in A$, and it is bounded above by $x$. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 By the least-upper-bound property, $A$ has a least upper bound $s = \sup A \in F$. [step 2.1, L1]

4.1 Since $1_F > 0$, we have $s - 1_F < s$; as $s$ is the least upper bound, $s - 1_F$ is not an upper bound of $A$. [step 3.1, L3]

5.1 Hence there is some $m \ge 1$ with $m \cdot 1_F > s - 1_F$. [step 4.1]

6.1 Adding $1_F$ to both sides, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F > s$. [step 5.1, L2]

7.1 But $(m+1) \cdot 1_F \in A$, so $(m+1) \cdot 1_F \le s$ because $s$ is an upper bound of $A$, contradicting 6.1. [step 6.1, step 3.1, L2]

8.1 The assumption is therefore untenable, so $F$ is Archimedean. [step 7.1, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Statement

Let $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ be sequences of reals ([[def-sequence]]) such that
$(b_k)$ is strictly increasing ([[def-monotone-sequence]]) and its range is not
bounded above ([[def-bounded-set]]). Then $b_{k+1} - b_k > 0$ for every $k$, so
the **difference quotient**

$$d_k \;:=\; \frac{a_{k+1} - a_k}{b_{k+1} - b_k}$$

is defined for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$. Suppose $(d_k)$ converges.

Then there is $K_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ with $b_k > 0$ for every $k \ge K_0$, so that
$q_j := a_{j + K_0} / b_{j + K_0}$ is a sequence of reals; that sequence
converges, and

$$\lim_j q_j \;=\; \lim_k d_k .$$

Both limits are asserted to exist: the right-hand one by hypothesis, the
left-hand one as part of the conclusion. If moreover $b_k \ne 0$ for every $k$,
so that $(a_k/b_k)$ is itself a sequence of reals, then it converges and
$\lim_k a_k/b_k = \lim_k d_k$, because convergence depends only on a tail
([[lem-limit-of-tail]]).

**Why the statement is about a tail.** Nothing forbids $b_0 = 0$, and the two
standard applications on the companion examples page have exactly that,
$b_k = k$ in one and $b_n = n^{p+1}$ in the other. Writing the conclusion for
the whole sequence would
be writing a quotient that does not denote at $k = 0$.

The notation is licensed by uniqueness of limits of real sequences
([[lem-limit-unique]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $(a_k)$, $(b_k)$ of reals with $(b_k)$ strictly increasing and with range not bounded above, and the difference quotients $d_k = (a_{k+1}-a_k)/(b_{k+1}-b_k)$, assumed to converge; write $L := \lim_k d_k$.

[L1] Sequences, tails and strict monotonicity: $(b_k)$ strictly increasing means $b_j < b_k$ for $j < k$, so $b_{k+1} - b_k > 0$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-monotone-sequence]]).

[L2] Not bounded above: no real is $\ge$ every element of the range ([[def-bounded-set]]).

[L3] A nondecreasing sequence whose range is not bounded above diverges to $+\infty$, that is, for every real $M$ there is $K$ with $b_k > M$ for all $k \ge K$ ([[lem-monotone-unbounded-diverges]], [[def-divergence-to-infinity]]).

[L4] Finite sums ([[def-finite-sum]]) and their laws: telescoping $\sum_{k<n}(c_{k+1}-c_k) = c_n - c_0$, splitting, additivity, scaling and monotonicity in the terms ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L5] Triangle inequalities: $\big|\sum_{k<n} u_k\big| \le \sum_{k<n}|u_k|$ ([[lem-triangle-inequality-finite]]) and $|u+v| \le |u|+|v|$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]); also $|uv| = |u||v|$ and $|u| = u$ for $u \ge 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L6] Convergence: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ beyond which the terms are within $\varepsilon$ of the limit, the rational and real formulations agreeing ([[def-real-limit]], [[def-sequence]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]); limits are unique ([[lem-limit-unique]]).

[L7] For a sequence of strictly positive reals, converging to $0$ is equivalent to the reciprocal sequence diverging to $+\infty$ ([[lem-reciprocal-of-null-diverges]]).

[L8] Convergence depends only on the tail ([[lem-limit-of-tail]]).

[L9] Algebra of limits: a scalar multiple of a convergent sequence converges to the scalar multiple of the limit ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]]).

[L10] Order arithmetic: $a > 0$ gives $a^{-1} > 0$ and $0 < a < b$ gives $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]); for $c > 0$, $a < b$ if and only if $ac < bc$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]); adding a constant preserves the order and inequalities add ([[lem-of-add-order]]); the order is total and transitive ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]); and of two indices one is the larger ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $(b_k)$ is nondecreasing and its range is not bounded above, so it diverges to $+\infty$; taking $M = 0$ gives $K_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ with $b_k > 0$ for every $k \ge K_0$, and then $q_j := a_{j+K_0}/b_{j+K_0}$ is a well-defined sequence of reals. [L1, L2, L3, L10]

1.2 For every $k$ one has $b_{k+1} - b_k > 0$, so each $d_k$ is defined and $a_{k+1} - a_k = d_k (b_{k+1} - b_k)$. [L1, L10]

2.1 For all $K < n$: telescoping gives $a_n - a_K = \sum_{k=K}^{n-1}(a_{k+1}-a_k) = \sum_{k=K}^{n-1} d_k (b_{k+1}-b_k)$ and $b_n - b_K = \sum_{k=K}^{n-1}(b_{k+1}-b_k)$, hence $a_n - a_K - L(b_n - b_K) = \sum_{k=K}^{n-1}(d_k - L)(b_{k+1}-b_k)$. [step 1.2, L4]

2.2 Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real; choose $K \ge K_0$ with $|d_k - L| < \varepsilon/2$ for every $k \ge K$. [step 1.1, L6, L10, choose]

3.1 For every $n > K$: $|a_n - a_K - L(b_n-b_K)| \le \sum_{k=K}^{n-1}|d_k - L|\,(b_{k+1}-b_k) \le (\varepsilon/2)(b_n - b_K)$, and $b_K > 0$ with $b_n > b_K$ gives $0 < b_n - b_K < b_n$, so dividing by $b_n > 0$ yields $\big|\,a_n/b_n - L - (a_K - Lb_K)/b_n\,\big| < \varepsilon/2$ and therefore $|a_n/b_n - L| < \varepsilon/2 + |a_K - Lb_K|\,/\,b_n$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L4, L5, L10]

3.2 The sequence $j \mapsto 1/b_{j+K_0}$ has strictly positive terms and its reciprocal $j \mapsto b_{j+K_0}$ diverges to $+\infty$, so it converges to $0$; multiplying by the constant $|a_K - Lb_K|$, the sequence $j \mapsto |a_K - Lb_K|/b_{j+K_0}$ converges to $0$. [step 1.1, step 2.2, L3, L7, L9]

4.1 So there is $N \ge K$ with $|a_K - Lb_K|/b_n < \varepsilon/2$ for every $n \ge N$, and then $|a_n/b_n - L| < \varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$ for every $n \ge N$; equivalently $|q_j - L| < \varepsilon$ for every $j \ge N - K_0$. [step 3.1, step 3.2, L6, L10]

5.1 As $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary, $(q_j)$ converges to $L$, so $\lim_j q_j$ exists and equals $L = \lim_k d_k$; and if $b_k \ne 0$ for every $k$ then $(a_k/b_k)$ is a sequence of reals whose $K_0$-th tail is $(q_j)$, so it too converges to $L$. [step 4.1, L6, L8] ∎

## Remarks

- **This is a discrete l'Hopital rule**, and the shape of the proof says why:
  the increments of $a$ are compared with the increments of $b$, the comparison
  is summed by telescoping, and the fixed head $a_K - Lb_K$ is washed out by the
  divergence of $b_n$. The head is exactly the constant of integration.

- **Strict increase is used twice**, once so that $b_{k+1}-b_k \ne 0$ and the
  quotients $d_k$ exist, and once so that $b_n - b_K > 0$ and the sum estimate
  keeps its sign. Unboundedness is used twice as well, once to reach positive
  $b_k$ and once to kill the head.

- **There is no converse**, not even under the same hypotheses:
  [[cex-stolz-cesaro-converse-fails]] exhibits $a_k$ and $b_k$ for which
  $a_k/b_k$ converges while $(d_k)$ oscillates between two values.

- **The Cesaro mean theorem is the special case** $a_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} x_k$,
  $b_n = n+1$: then $d_n = x_{n+1}$, and the conclusion reads
  $\sigma_n \to \lim_k x_k$. That deduction is not carried out here, because
  [[thm-cesaro-mean-theorem]] is proved directly and earlier; the observation is
  recorded so the reader can see the two results are one.
