You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as a
read-only adversarial proof-refuter for the published-page audit. You are
tool-less: you cannot open a file, run a command, browse, edit, or delegate.
Everything you may rely on is reproduced in the `This dispatch` section. Return
evidence only; Audit-Alpha alone adjudicates and edits.

## Triage — the standing rule (verbatim, binding on you)

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct
  citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

## Adversarial standard

Read the target's title, Statement/Definition/Example/Statement refuted, Facts &
Assumptions, every numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks.
Try to falsify the public claim and every load-bearing inference.

1. Compare every cited fact with the supplied source text before alleging that
   it is weak. Check domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, direction, conclusion,
   and whether the source licenses the exact use.
2. Check that the title and public statement assert no more than the proof
   establishes, and that every proof step uses only available premises.
3. Check both directions of biconditionals, uniqueness/existence claims,
   induction and limiting arguments, empty/zero/endpoint/degenerate cases,
   extended-real conventions, index shifts, and hidden division or choice.
4. Re-read Remarks as skeptically as a numbered step. A false mathematical
   remark is a defect even when the proof is sound.
5. When the target is marked `ai-generated`, actively search for a
   counterexample to its claim, witness, or refutation rather than merely
   checking prose consistency.
6. Treat a false public claim, logically invalid proof, missing necessary
   hypothesis, circularity, or materially inaccurate load-bearing citation as
   fatal. Do not inflate an expository omission or a gap closable within thirty
   seconds into a defect.

## Output format

Reply with exactly this structure and no preamble:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

If `DEFECTS`, give one block per finding:

```text
FINDING 1
  location: [exact title, section, fact label, or numbered step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [the exact mathematical assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, missing hypothesis, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]
```

Then always end with:

```text
BOUNDARY: [specific boundary/counterexample checks and their disposition]
SOURCES:  [confirm every supplied cited item used by the target was inspected]
CHECKED:  [confirm the title, public claim, every numbered step, and Remarks were read]

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field with the Bolzano-Weierstrass property (BW) of
[[def-completeness-properties]]. Then $F$ is Archimedean
([[def-archimedean-field]]).

Consequently (BW) needs no Archimedean hypothesis attached to it, in contrast
with the nested interval property and with Cauchy completeness, which do
([[fs-nested-intervals-implies-lub]], [[fs-cauchy-complete-implies-lub]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with (BW).

[L1] The property (BW): every bounded sequence in $F$ has a subsequence converging in $F$ ([[def-completeness-properties]]).

[L2] Sequences in an ordered field: a sequence is a function $\mathbb{N} \to F$; it is bounded when $|x_k| \le M$ for every $k$ and some $M \in F$; a subsequence is taken along a strictly increasing $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$; convergence and Cauchyness in $F$ are as fixed there ([[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Archimedean property: $F$ is Archimedean when for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$, where $0 \cdot 1_F = 0$ and $(n+1)\cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ ([[def-archimedean-field]]).

[L4] Canonical naturals: $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for $n \ge 1$, the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing on $\{1,2,3,\dots\}$, and $(m+n)\cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L5] Absolute value: $|u| = u$ whenever $u \ge 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L6] A sequence converging in $F$ is Cauchy in $F$ (clause 3 of [[lem-of-sequence-basics]]).

[L7] Order arithmetic: $0 < 1_F$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]); the order is total, so the failure of $x < y$ is $y \le x$; adding a constant preserves the order ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[def-ordered-field]]). Here [[lem-of-add-order]] states the STRICT forms and only those; the nonstrict forms used below are those together with the equality cases, which trichotomy settles, the order being total ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L8] Discreteness of $\mathbb{N}$: $m < p$ if and only if $m + 1 \le p$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose $F$ has (BW) and is not Archimedean; then there is $x \in F$ such that $x < n \cdot 1_F$ fails for every natural $n$, that is, $n \cdot 1_F \le x$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. [L3, L7, assume-contra]

1.2 Let $(y_k)$ be the sequence in $F$ given by $y_k := k \cdot 1_F$, so that $y_0 = 0$, $y_{k+1} = y_k + 1_F$, and $y_k \ge 0$ for every $k$. [L2, L3, L4]

2.1 $(y_k)$ is bounded: $|y_k| = y_k \le x$ for every $k$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L2, L5]

3.1 By (BW) there is a strictly increasing $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ and an $L \in F$ with $y_{n_j} \to L$ in $F$. [step 2.1, L1, L2]

4.1 The subsequence $(y_{n_j})$ is therefore Cauchy in $F$, so, $1_F$ being positive, there is $J \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|y_{n_j} - y_{n_i}| < 1_F$ for all $i, j \ge J$. [step 3.1, L2, L6, L7]

5.1 But $n_J < n_{J+1}$ gives $n_J + 1 \le n_{J+1}$ and hence $y_{n_{J+1}} \ge y_{n_J + 1} = y_{n_J} + 1_F$, so $y_{n_{J+1}} - y_{n_J} \ge 1_F > 0$ and $|y_{n_{J+1}} - y_{n_J}| \ge 1_F$, contradicting step 4.1. [step 1.2, step 4.1, L4, L5, L7, L8]

6.1 The assumption of step 1.1 is therefore untenable, and an ordered field with (BW) is Archimedean. [step 5.1, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **The witness sequence is the obstruction itself.** In a non-Archimedean field
  the canonical naturals are bounded, so they form a bounded sequence; and no
  subsequence of them can converge, because consecutive terms of any
  subsequence stay at distance at least $1_F$. That is the whole argument, and
  it shows that (BW) fails in every non-Archimedean ordered field, for instance
  in $\mathbb{R}(t)$ ([[cex-ordered-field-not-archimedean]]) and in
  $\mathbb{R}((t^{-1}))$ ([[lem-laurent-non-archimedean]]).

- Note which direction is being used: the sequence is bounded and has no
  convergent subsequence, so (BW) is contradicted. Nothing here says that
  $(y_k)$ fails to be Cauchy for some other reason; it is Cauchy along no
  subsequence at all.

## Statement refuted

**Refuted claim:** every ordered field is Archimedean, that is, in every ordered
field $F$ each $x \in F$ satisfies $x < n \cdot 1_F$ for some natural number $n$.

The witness is $\mathbb{R}(t)$, the field of rational functions over $\mathbb{R}$,
ordered so that $f > 0$ exactly when $f(x) > 0$ for all sufficiently large real
$x$. In this ordered field the element $t$ exceeds every canonical natural
number, so the naturals are not cofinal.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $\mathbb{R}(t)$, the field of fractions of the polynomial ring $\mathbb{R}[t]$, and the set $P = \{f \in \mathbb{R}(t) : f \ne 0 \text{ and } f(x) > 0 \text{ for all sufficiently large real } x\}$.

[L1] An ordered field is a field with a positive cone $P$ satisfying trichotomy (for each nonzero $x$, exactly one of $x \in P$, $-x \in P$) and closure of $P$ under addition and multiplication; then $a < b$ means $b - a \in P$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] An ordered field $F$ is Archimedean when for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$, equivalently the canonical naturals $n \cdot 1_F$ are cofinal ([[def-archimedean-field]]).

[L3] Every complete ordered field is Archimedean ([[thm-of-archimedean]]).

[L4] $\mathbb{R}$ is a totally ordered field ([[thm-reals-ordered-field]]).

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $f=p/q\ne0$, where $p(x)=a_mx^m+\cdots+a_0$ and $q(x)=b_nx^n+\cdots+b_0$ have nonzero leading coefficients. For $x>1$, dividing by the leading terms gives $p(x)=a_mx^m(1+\sum_{i<m}(a_i/a_m)x^{i-m})$ and the analogous formula for $q$. If $x$ is larger than $1$ plus the sums of the absolute values of the lower coefficient ratios, then both lower-term sums have absolute value less than $1$. Thus $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ eventually have the signs of $a_m$ and $b_n$, respectively, and $f(x)$ has the constant nonzero eventual sign of $a_m/b_n$. Hence exactly one of $f\in P$ and $-f\in P$ holds. [given, L4, algebra]

1.2 If $f, g \in P$ then $f(x) > 0$ and $g(x) > 0$ for all large $x$, so $(f + g)(x) > 0$ and $(fg)(x) > 0$ for all large $x$, giving $f + g \in P$ and $fg \in P$. [given, algebra]

1.3 For each natural number $n$ the rational function $t - n \cdot 1 = t - n$ satisfies $(t - n)(x) = x - n > 0$ for all $x > n$, so $t - n \in P$. [given, algebra]

2.1 By the trichotomy of step 1.1 and the closure of step 1.2, $P$ is a positive cone, so $\mathbb{R}(t)$ is an ordered field. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1]

2.2 By step 1.3, $t - n \cdot 1 \in P$ for every natural $n$, which by [L1] means $n \cdot 1 < t$ for every natural $n$. [step 1.3, L1]

3.1 In the ordered field $\mathbb{R}(t)$ the element $t$ satisfies $n \cdot 1 < t$ for every natural $n$ (step 2.2), so no natural $n$ has $t < n \cdot 1$; the canonical naturals are not cofinal and $\mathbb{R}(t)$ is not Archimedean, refuting the claim that every ordered field is Archimedean. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L2]

4.1 This is consistent with [L3], whose contrapositive states that a non-Archimedean ordered field cannot be complete: $\mathbb{R}(t)$ is an ordered field that is not complete. [step 3.1, L3] ∎

## Statement

In any ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, the multiplicative identity
satisfies $0 < 1$; that is, $1 \in P$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$ and multiplicative identity $1$ ([[def-field]]).

[L1] In any field $1 \neq 0$ ([[def-field]]).

[L2] For every $x \neq 0$ the square satisfies $x^2 > 0$ ([[lem-of-square-positive]]).

[L3] The identity axiom gives $1 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1^2$ ([[def-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By the field axioms $1 \neq 0$, and $1 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1^2$. [L1, L3]

2.1 Since $1 \neq 0$, applying the square lemma with $x = 1$ gives $1^2 > 0$. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 Because $1 = 1^2$, it follows that $1 > 0$, i.e. $0 < 1$. [step 2.1, step 1.1, L3] ∎

## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]). For a natural number
$n \ge 1$, write $n \cdot 1_F := \underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$ for the
$n$-fold sum of the multiplicative identity, and $0 \cdot 1_F := 0$. These are
the **canonical natural numbers** of $F$.

$F$ is **Archimedean** if for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n$ with

$$x < n \cdot 1_F.$$

Equivalently, the canonical naturals $(n \cdot 1_F)_{n \ge 1}$ are **cofinal**:
no single element of $F$ is an upper bound for all of them.

## Remarks

- Equivalently (applying the definition to $1/\varepsilon$): for every
  $\varepsilon > 0$ in $F$ there is $n$ with $1/(n \cdot 1_F) < \varepsilon$, so
  the canonical fractions $1/n$ are arbitrarily small.
- That the canonical naturals are well-defined, positive, and strictly
  increasing is [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]. Every complete ordered field is
  Archimedean ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); an ordered field need not be
  ([[cex-ordered-field-not-archimedean]]).

## Definition

Throughout, $F$ is an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with its order and
its absolute value. Sequences in $F$, and the notions of convergence in $F$,
Cauchyness in $F$, boundedness, nondecreasing and nonincreasing, subsequence,
closed interval $[a,b]_F$, nesting, and lengths tending to $0$ in $F$, are the
ones fixed once and for all in [[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]]. They are
not restated here and they are never read in $\mathbb{R}$: every $\varepsilon$
below ranges over the positive elements of $F$ itself.

A sequence $(x_k)$ in $F$ is **bounded above** when there is $B \in F$ with
$x_k \le B$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, and a subset $S \subseteq F$ is bounded
above when there is $B \in F$ with $s \le B$ for every $s \in S$
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-upper-bound]]).

The following are five properties that $F$ may or may not have.

- **(LUB), the least-upper-bound property.** Every nonempty $S \subseteq F$ that
  is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$. This is exactly the condition
  that makes $F$ a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), and
  the two names are used interchangeably here.

- **(MCT), the monotone convergence property.** Every nondecreasing sequence in
  $F$ that is bounded above converges in $F$.

- **(NIP), the nested interval property.** For every nested sequence
  $(I_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of closed intervals $I_k = [a_k, b_k]_F$ of $F$
  whose lengths tend to $0$ in $F$, the intersection

  $$\bigcap_{k \in \mathbb{N}} I_k$$

  is nonempty.

- **(BW), the Bolzano-Weierstrass property.** Every bounded sequence in $F$ has
  a subsequence that converges in $F$.

- **(CC), Cauchy completeness.** Every Cauchy sequence in $F$ converges in $F$.

Alongside these we use the **Archimedean property (ARCH)** of
[[def-archimedean-field]]: for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n$
with $x < n \cdot 1_F$.

## Remarks

- **(NIP) is stated in the shrinking form because that is the form both
  satisfied by the formal Laurent series field and used by the bisection
  theorem.** The field $\mathbb{R}((t^{-1}))$ is Cauchy complete without having
  least upper bounds ([[thm-laurent-cauchy-complete]],
  [[cor-laurent-not-lub-complete]]), and it satisfies shrinking (NIP)
  ([[cor-laurent-nested-intervals]]). The same shrinking condition is exactly
  what the bisection argument of
  [[lem-nested-intervals-and-archimedean-imply-bw]] produces.

- **"Lengths tend to $0$" is read in $F$.** For a non-Archimedean $F$ this is
  strictly stronger than the same words read in $\mathbb{R}$ through some
  identification of the rational scalars, and the difference is not academic:
  the remarks of [[cor-laurent-nested-intervals]] exhibit intervals in
  $\mathbb{R}((t^{-1}))$ whose lengths are the real constants $2/(n+1)$, which
  tend to $0$ in the ordinary real sense and do not tend to $0$ in the order of
  that field.

- **Boundedness of a sequence is two-sided, boundedness above is not.**
  [[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]] calls $(x_k)$ bounded when
  $|x_k| \le M$ for every $k$, which is the hypothesis of (BW); (MCT) asks only
  for the one-sided bound $x_k \le B$, which for a nondecreasing sequence is the
  only side in question, since $x_0 \le x_k$ always.

- **(MCT) is stated for nondecreasing sequences only.** The nonincreasing case
  is not a separate assumption: if $(x_k)$ is nonincreasing and bounded below by
  $b$ then $(-x_k)$ is nondecreasing and bounded above by $-b$, and $x_k \to L$
  exactly when $-x_k \to -L$, because $|(-x_k) - (-L)| = |x_k - L|$. That
  reduction is used in the proof of [[lem-mct-implies-lub]].

- **Nothing here presumes that any of the five holds.** They are predicates on
  an ordered field, and the point of the page they open is that in the presence
  of (ARCH) they are all the same predicate ([[thm-completeness-equivalences]]),
  while without it two of them are strictly weaker
  ([[fs-nested-intervals-implies-lub]], [[fs-cauchy-complete-implies-lub]]).

- **(CC) is this library's third rendering of "Cauchy complete", and for $\mathbb{R}$ all three agree.** [[def-cauchy-in-metric]] and [[def-complete-metric-space]] read Cauchyness and completeness in a metric space, and the case $n = 1$ of [[thm-euclidean-space-complete]] proves $(\mathbb{R}, |x-y|)$ complete; [[def-real-limit]] reads both notions for real sequences, with $\varepsilon$ ranging over the positive rationals; the present definition reads them in an ordered field $F$. For $F = \mathbb{R}$ under the metric $d(x,y) = |x-y|$ of [[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]] the three unfold to the same quantified statement: below every positive real lies a positive rational ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), so the two ranges of $\varepsilon$ pick out the same Cauchy sequences and the same convergent ones. So "$\mathbb{R}$ satisfies (CC)" is a statement this library has already proved twice, as [[thm-cauchy-criterion-via-lub]] and as the case $n = 1$ of [[thm-euclidean-space-complete]]. The parallel stops at $\mathbb{R}$. The absolute value of an ordered field takes its values in $F$, while a metric is required to take its values in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-metric-space]]), so for a non-Archimedean $F$ the map $(x,y) \mapsto |x-y|$ is not a metric in this library's sense and the metric development says nothing about it. That is why [[lem-of-sequence-basics]] had to be proved from the order axioms alone, although its Cauchy clauses reappear for metric spaces as [[lem-metric-convergent-implies-cauchy]], [[lem-metric-cauchy-bounded]] and [[lem-metric-cauchy-with-convergent-subsequence]]. Neither development generalises the other; they meet exactly at $\mathbb{R}$.

## Definition

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ ([[def-field]]) together with a subset
$P \subseteq F$, the set of **positive** elements (the *positive cone*),
satisfying:

- **(O1) Trichotomy.** For each $x \in F$, exactly one of the following holds:
  $x \in P$, or $x = 0$, or $-x \in P$.
- **(O2) Closure.** If $x, y \in P$ then $x + y \in P$ and $x \cdot y \in P$.

We write $x > 0$ for $x \in P$ (read "$x$ is positive"), and define the order by

$$a < b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; b - a \in P, \qquad a \le b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; a < b \text{ or } a = b.$$

Thus $a > b$ means $b < a$, and $a \ge b$ means $b \le a$. An element $x$ with
$-x \in P$ (equivalently $x < 0$) is called **negative**.

## Remarks

- By trichotomy applied to $b - a$, for any $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$,
  $a = b$, $a > b$ holds; this makes $\le$ a total order.
- (O2) says the positives are closed under addition and multiplication: sums and
  products of positives are positive.
- The rationals ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and both constructions of the reals
  ([[thm-reals-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-dedekind-ordered-field]]) are ordered
  fields, so every fact proved here from (O1)-(O2) holds in each of them.

## Definition

Throughout, $F$ is an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with its order and
its absolute value $|\cdot|$ ([[def-abs-value]]), and $\mathbb{N}$ is the set of
natural numbers with its order ([[def-natural-numbers]], [[def-nat-order]]).

A **sequence in $F$** is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to F$. We write $x_k$ for
$x(k)$ and $(x_k)$, or $(x_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$, for the function itself.

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence in $F$.

- $(x_k)$ is **bounded** when there is $M \in F$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for every
  $k \in \mathbb{N}$.
- $(x_k)$ **converges to** $L \in F$ when

  $$\text{for every } \varepsilon \in F \text{ with } \varepsilon > 0 \text{ there is } N \in \mathbb{N} \text{ such that } |x_k - L| < \varepsilon \text{ for all } k \ge N.$$

  We then write $x_k \to L$ *in $F$*. The sequence is **convergent in $F$** when
  it converges to some $L \in F$, and **divergent in $F$** otherwise.
- $(x_k)$ is **Cauchy in $F$** when

  $$\text{for every } \varepsilon \in F \text{ with } \varepsilon > 0 \text{ there is } N \in \mathbb{N} \text{ such that } |x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon \text{ for all } k, l \ge N.$$

- $(x_k)$ is **nondecreasing** when $x_j \le x_k$ for all $j \le k$,
  **increasing** when $x_j < x_k$ for all $j < k$, **nonincreasing** when
  $x_j \ge x_k$ for all $j \le k$, **decreasing** when $x_j > x_k$ for all
  $j < k$, and **monotone** when it is nondecreasing or nonincreasing.
- For a strictly increasing $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$, the **subsequence**
  of $(x_k)$ along $n$ is the composite $(x_{n_j})_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$. An
  element $L \in F$ is a **subsequential limit** of $(x_k)$ when some
  subsequence of $(x_k)$ converges to $L$ in $F$.

**Closed intervals and nesting.** For $a, b \in F$ with $a \le b$, the **closed
interval** with endpoints $a$ and $b$ is

$$[a,b]_F \;:=\; \{\, x \in F : a \le x \le b \,\},$$

and its **length** is $b - a \ge 0$. A sequence $(I_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of
closed intervals $I_k = [a_k, b_k]_F$ is **nested** when $I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k$
for every $k$. Its **lengths tend to $0$ in $F$** when the sequence
$(b_k - a_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges to $0$ in the sense above, that is,
when for every $\varepsilon > 0$ in $F$ there is $N \in \mathbb{N}$ with
$b_k - a_k < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge N$ (the absolute value may be dropped
because each length is $\ge 0$).

## Remarks

- **The thresholds range over $F$, and that is not a stylistic choice.** In an
  Archimedean ordered field one may equivalently test $\varepsilon$ over the
  canonical rationals, and that is what the $\mathbb{R}$-specific
  [[def-real-limit]] does; the two agree there, as the remark on rational and
  real $\varepsilon$ in [[def-sequence]] records. In a general $F$ they do
  **not** agree, because the canonical rationals need not be cofinal below the
  positive elements. A concrete failure lives on this page: in
  $\mathbb{R}((t^{-1}))$ every positive rational constant exceeds $t^{-1}$
  (clause 4 of [[lem-laurent-non-archimedean]], since a nonzero constant is
  nonzero at index $0$), so the sequence taking the value $0$ at even indices
  and $t^{-1}$ at odd indices would satisfy the Cauchy condition read with
  rational thresholds only, while failing it at $\varepsilon = t^{-2}$, where
  consecutive terms differ by $t^{-1} > t^{-2}$; and it has no limit at all,
  since a convergent sequence is Cauchy by the triangle inequality. Every
  definition above therefore
  quantifies over $\varepsilon \in F$, and no proof in this library may
  substitute a rational threshold in a field that has not been shown to be
  Archimedean.

- **These are the $\mathbb{R}$-notions with $\mathbb{R}$ replaced by $F$, and
  nothing more.** Sequence, tail, subsequence and boundedness are
  [[def-sequence]]; monotonicity is [[def-monotone-sequence]]; subsequential
  limits are [[def-subsequential-limit]]; convergence and Cauchyness are
  [[def-real-limit]]; closed intervals are the form $[a,b]$ of
  [[def-interval]]. Only the field in which the inequalities are read has
  changed.

- **Transfer of theorems is not automatic, and citing an $\mathbb{R}$-item for a
  general $F$ is a citation error.** A result proved about sequences of reals is
  a statement about $\mathbb{R}$. Many such proofs use only the ordered-field
  axioms and go through for any $F$ verbatim, and many others use completeness
  or the Archimedean property and do not. Which is which has to be settled by
  reading the proof; until an item is stated for a general ordered field, it may
  not be cited for one.

- **Limits are unique in any ordered field.** If $x_k \to L$ and $x_k \to L'$
  in $F$ with $L \ne L'$, put $\varepsilon := |L - L'|/2$, which is positive
  because $|L-L'| > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]) and $2 = 1 + 1 > 0$. Choose $N$
  beyond which both $|x_k - L| < \varepsilon$ and $|x_k - L'| < \varepsilon$
  hold, and take any $k \ge N$: the triangle inequality
  ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]], proved for an arbitrary ordered field) gives
  $|L - L'| \le |L - x_k| + |x_k - L'| < 2\varepsilon = |L - L'|$, which is
  impossible. So the limit, when it exists, is unique, and the notation
  $\lim_k x_k$ is unambiguous. No completeness and no Archimedean hypothesis is
  used.

- **Indexing starts at $0$**, as everywhere in this library, because
  $0 \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]). A nested sequence of intervals
  therefore begins with $I_0$, and a statement about "the first $N$ terms" means
  the indices $0, \dots, N-1$.

## Statement

**False claim:** every ordered field in which every Cauchy sequence converges,
that is, every ordered field with (CC) as in [[def-completeness-properties]],
has the least-upper-bound property (LUB).

This is clause 4 of [[thm-completeness-equivalences]] with its Archimedean
hypothesis deleted. The witness is again the formal Laurent series field
$K = \mathbb{R}((t^{-1}))$: every Cauchy sequence in $K$ converges in $K$, and
$K$ has no least upper bound for the set of its own canonical naturals.

**This is the sharpest of the failures on this page**, because "complete" is the
word most often used loosely for both properties at once. In $\mathbb{R}$ they
coincide; in an ordered field they do not, and the difference is exactly the
Archimedean property.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The formal Laurent series field $K = \mathbb{R}((t^{-1}))$.

[L1] $K$ is an ordered field ([[thm-laurent-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Every sequence in $K$ that is Cauchy in $K$ converges in $K$ ([[thm-laurent-cauchy-complete]]); Cauchyness and convergence in an ordered field are as in [[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]], and that is exactly (CC) ([[def-completeness-properties]]).

[L3] $K$ is not a complete ordered field: the set $A = \{\, n \cdot 1_K : n \in \mathbb{N}\,\}$ is nonempty and bounded above by $t$ and has no least upper bound in $K$ ([[cor-laurent-not-lub-complete]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L4] $K$ is not Archimedean, since $n \cdot 1_K < t$ for every natural $n$ ([[lem-laurent-non-archimedean]], [[def-archimedean-field]]).

[L5] For an ordered field, the Archimedean property together with (CC) does imply (LUB) ([[thm-completeness-equivalences]], clause 4 implies clause 1).

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $K$ is an ordered field. [L1]

1.2 $K$ has (CC): every Cauchy sequence in $K$ converges in $K$. [L2]

1.3 $K$ does not have (LUB), the set of its canonical naturals being nonempty, bounded above and without a least upper bound. [L3]

2.1 So $K$ is an ordered field with (CC) and without (LUB), and the claim is false. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3]

3.1 What fails in $K$ is precisely the hypothesis that the claim deleted: $K$ is not Archimedean, and with that hypothesis restored the implication is true. [step 1.1, L4, L5] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the thresholds are read is what makes this possible.** Cauchyness in
  $K$ is tested against every positive element of $K$, including the
  infinitesimals ([[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]]), so the condition is
  much stronger in $K$ than the same words read with rational thresholds. It is
  strong enough that only sequences whose coefficients freeze can satisfy it,
  and those all converge. Meanwhile the canonical naturals, which are what (LUB)
  fails on, are not Cauchy at all, so (CC) never gets a chance to see them.

- **The three properties $K$ has and the three it lacks.** It has (CC) and (NIP)
  in the shrinking form ([[cor-laurent-nested-intervals]]) and it is an ordered
  field; it lacks (LUB), and hence also (BW) and (MCT), each of which would force
  it to be Archimedean ([[lem-bw-implies-archimedean]],
  [[lem-mct-implies-archimedean]]).

- **A reader who wants a single sentence:** Cauchy completeness says the field
  has no holes that a sequence can point at; the least-upper-bound property says
  it has no holes at all. In a non-Archimedean field a sequence indexed by
  $\mathbb{N}$ is too short to point at the holes.

## Statement

**False claim:** every ordered field with the nested interval property (NIP) of
[[def-completeness-properties]] has the least-upper-bound property (LUB).

This is clause 2 of [[thm-completeness-equivalences]] with its Archimedean
hypothesis deleted, and the deletion is exactly what makes it false. The witness
is the formal Laurent series field $K = \mathbb{R}((t^{-1}))$, which satisfies
(NIP) and has no least upper bound for the set of its own canonical naturals.

Note that the false claim is being refuted in the *shrinking* form of (NIP),
which is the weaker hypothesis and therefore makes the implication stronger.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The formal Laurent series field $K = \mathbb{R}((t^{-1}))$.

[L1] $K$ is an ordered field ([[thm-laurent-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Every nested sequence of closed intervals of $K$ whose lengths tend to $0$ in $K$ has exactly one point in its intersection ([[cor-laurent-nested-intervals]]); intervals, nesting and lengths tending to $0$ in an ordered field are as in [[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]], and (NIP) asks exactly that such an intersection be nonempty ([[def-completeness-properties]]).

[L3] $K$ is not a complete ordered field: the set $A = \{\, n \cdot 1_K : n \in \mathbb{N}\,\}$ is nonempty and bounded above by $t$ and has no least upper bound in $K$ ([[cor-laurent-not-lub-complete]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L4] $K$ is not Archimedean, since $n \cdot 1_K < t$ for every natural $n$ ([[lem-laurent-non-archimedean]], [[def-archimedean-field]]).

[L5] For an ordered field, the Archimedean property together with (NIP) does imply (LUB) ([[thm-completeness-equivalences]], clause 2 implies clause 1).

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $K$ is an ordered field. [L1]

1.2 $K$ has (NIP): any nested sequence of closed intervals of $K$ whose lengths tend to $0$ in $K$ has a point in its intersection, indeed exactly one. [L2]

1.3 $K$ does not have (LUB), the set of its canonical naturals being nonempty, bounded above and without a least upper bound. [L3]

2.1 So $K$ is an ordered field with (NIP) and without (LUB), and the claim is false. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3]

3.1 What fails in $K$ is precisely the hypothesis that the claim deleted: $K$ is not Archimedean, and with that hypothesis restored the implication is true. [step 1.1, L4, L5] ∎

## Remarks

- **The failure is not an accident of one field.** By [[lem-lub-implies-nested-intervals]] every field with (LUB) is Archimedean, so any witness at all must be non-Archimedean; and in a non-Archimedean field the shrinking hypothesis in (NIP) is a severe restriction, because a length that tends to $0$ in the order of the field must get below every infinitesimal. That is why checking shrinking (NIP) in $K$ is substantive, and why $K$ can satisfy (NIP) while failing (LUB) at all.

- **$\mathbb{R}(t)$ will not do as a witness**, although it is the library's other non-Archimedean ordered field ([[cex-ordered-field-not-archimedean]]). Nothing in this library establishes any nested interval property for it, and the page that built $K$ says why a new field was constructed rather than reusing that one.

- **The companion failure** is [[fs-cauchy-complete-implies-lub]], refuted by the same field. Together they are the exact content of the Archimedean hypotheses in clauses 2 and 4 of [[thm-completeness-equivalences]].

## Statement

Let $K = \mathbb{R}((t^{-1}))$ be the ordered field of
[[thm-laurent-ordered-field]], and identify a natural number with its image in
$\mathbb{Z}$ when it is used as an index. Then:

1. $n \cdot 1_K < t$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$; consequently $K$ is **not**
   Archimedean ([[def-archimedean-field]]).
2. $0_K < t^{-(k+1)} < t^{-k}$ for every $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.
3. **(Countable cofinality.)** For every $\varepsilon \in K$ with
   $\varepsilon > 0_K$ there is $k \in \mathbb{N}$ with
   $0_K < t^{-k} < \varepsilon$; indeed every integer $k > v(\varepsilon)$
   works.
4. **(The monomials measure the valuation.)** For $h \in K$ and $k \in
   \mathbb{Z}$: if $h(j) = 0$ for every $j \le k$ then $|h| < t^{-k}$; and
   conversely, if $|h| < t^{-k}$ then $h(j) = 0$ for every $j < k$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $K$ with its valuation $v$, leading coefficient $\operatorname{lc}$, monomials $t^{-a}$ and constants $\iota(c)$.

[L1] For nonzero $h \in K$, $h(k) = 0$ for $k < v(h)$ and $h(v(h)) = \operatorname{lc}(h) \ne 0$; $t^{-a}$ is $1$ at index $a$ and $0$ elsewhere, so $t^{-a} \ne 0_K$ with $v(t^{-a}) = a$ and $\operatorname{lc}(t^{-a}) = 1$; and $t = t^{-(-1)}$ ([[def-formal-laurent-series]]).

[L2] $K$ is an ordered field in which $f < g$ holds exactly when $g - f \ne 0_K$ and $\operatorname{lc}(g-f) > 0$; for $f \ne 0_K$ one has $|f| \ne 0_K$, $v(|f|) = v(f)$ and $\operatorname{lc}(|f|) > 0$; and $n \cdot 1_K = \iota(n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}})$, which for $n \ge 1$ is nonzero with $v = 0$ ([[thm-laurent-ordered-field]], [[def-abs-value]]).

[L3] For nonzero $f, g \in K$: $-f \ne 0_K$ with $v(-f) = v(f)$; and if $v(f) < v(g)$ then $f + g \ne 0_K$ with $\operatorname{lc}(f+g) = \operatorname{lc}(f)$ ([[lem-laurent-valuation]]).

[L4] An ordered field $F$ is Archimedean when for every $x \in F$ there is a natural $n$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$; and in an ordered field exactly one of $x < y$, $x = y$, $y < x$ holds ([[def-archimedean-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] The order on $\mathbb{Z}$ is total, and every integer $\ge 0$ is the image of a unique natural number; so for every $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ there is a natural $k$ whose image exceeds $m$ ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]], [[def-int-order]], [[lem-nat-embeds-int]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For every $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ the monomial $t^{-k}$ is nonzero with $\operatorname{lc}(t^{-k}) = 1 > 0$, so $t^{-k} > 0_K$ by [L2]; and since $v(t^{-k}) = k < k+1 = v(-t^{-(k+1)})$ by [L1] and [L3], the difference $t^{-k} - t^{-(k+1)}$ is nonzero with leading coefficient $\operatorname{lc}(t^{-k}) = 1 > 0$, so $t^{-(k+1)} < t^{-k}$. [L1, L2, L3]

1.2 Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. If $n = 0$ then $t - n \cdot 1_K = t$, which is nonzero with $\operatorname{lc}(t) = 1 > 0$. If $n \ge 1$ then $n \cdot 1_K$ is nonzero with $v(n \cdot 1_K) = 0$, so $-(n\cdot 1_K)$ is nonzero with valuation $0$ by [L3], while $v(t) = -1 < 0$; hence $t - n\cdot 1_K$ is nonzero with leading coefficient $\operatorname{lc}(t) = 1 > 0$ by [L3]. In both cases $n \cdot 1_K < t$ by [L2]. [L1, L2, L3]

1.3 Conversely, let $h \in K$ and $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $|h| < t^{-k}$, and suppose $h \ne 0_K$ with $v(h) < k$. Then $v(|h|) = v(h) < k = v(t^{-k})$ and $\operatorname{lc}(|h|) > 0$ by [L2], so $|h| - t^{-k}$ is nonzero with leading coefficient $\operatorname{lc}(|h|) > 0$ by [L3], giving $t^{-k} < |h|$ and contradicting $|h| < t^{-k}$ by the trichotomy of [L4]. Hence $h = 0_K$ or $v(h) \ge k$, and in either case $h(j) = 0$ for every $j < k$ by [L1]. [L1, L2, L3, L4]

2.1 Let $h \in K$ and $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $h(j) = 0$ for every $j \le k$. If $h = 0_K$ then $|h| = 0_K < t^{-k}$ by [step 1.1]. Otherwise $h \ne 0_K$ with $v(h) > k$, so $|h| \ne 0_K$ with $v(|h|) = v(h) > k = v(t^{-k})$ by [L1] and [L2]; then $t^{-k} - |h|$ is nonzero with leading coefficient $\operatorname{lc}(t^{-k}) = 1 > 0$ by [L3], so $|h| < t^{-k}$ by [L2]. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L3]

2.2 Let $\varepsilon \in K$ with $\varepsilon > 0_K$, so $\varepsilon \ne 0_K$ and $\operatorname{lc}(\varepsilon) > 0$ by [L2]; put $m := v(\varepsilon)$ and use [L5] to fix a natural $k$ with $k > m$. Then $v(\varepsilon) = m < k = v(t^{-k}) = v(-t^{-k})$ by [L1] and [L3], so $\varepsilon - t^{-k}$ is nonzero with leading coefficient $\operatorname{lc}(\varepsilon) > 0$, that is $t^{-k} < \varepsilon$; and $t^{-k} > 0_K$ by [step 1.1]. The same computation applies to every integer $k > m$. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L3, L5]

2.3 By [step 1.2], $n \cdot 1_K < t$ for every natural $n$; by the trichotomy of [L4] no natural $n$ can then satisfy $t < n \cdot 1_K$, so the defining condition of [L4] fails at $x = t$ and $K$ is not Archimedean. [step 1.2, L4]

3.1 Clause 1 is [step 1.2] with [step 2.3], clause 2 is [step 1.1], clause 3 is [step 2.2], and clause 4 is [step 2.1] together with [step 1.3]. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 1.3, step 2.2, step 2.3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why clause 3 is the pivotal one.** The valuation takes its values in
  $\mathbb{Z}$, which has countable cofinality, and clause 3 is the translation
  of that fact into the order of $K$: a *countable* family, the monomials
  $t^{-k}$ with $k \in \mathbb{N}$, already gets below every positive element.
  This is what makes the sequential Cauchy condition in $K$ testable against
  countably many thresholds, and it is the reason a sequence indexed by
  $\mathbb{N}$ suffices to reach a limit in [[thm-laurent-cauchy-complete]].
  Nothing like it would hold if the exponents were allowed to range over a
  group of uncountable cofinality.

- **Non-Archimedean here is a statement about $t$, not about the constants.**
  The canonical naturals of $K$ are the constant series
  $n \cdot 1_K = \iota(n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}})$ (clause 3 of
  [[thm-laurent-ordered-field]]), all of valuation $0$, and what bounds them
  above is $t$, of valuation $-1$. The computation in step 1.2 uses nothing
  about $t$ beyond that: every *positive* element of negative valuation exceeds
  every canonical natural, because a strict inequality between valuations
  decides the comparison outright, whatever the coefficients are.

## Statement

For all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$: $m < n \iff \sigma(m) \le n$ ([[def-nat-order]]). Consequently there is no $k$ with $n < k < \sigma(n)$: the successor $\sigma(n)$ is the immediate successor of $n$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The order $m \le n \iff \exists j\ (m + j = n)$, with $m < n$ meaning $m \le n$ and $m \ne n$ ([[def-nat-order]]), and addition with $m + 0 = m$, $m + \sigma(n) = \sigma(m + n)$ ([[def-nat-addition]]).

[L1] Every nonzero natural is a successor: $j \ne 0 \Rightarrow j = \sigma(i)$ ([[lem-nat-nonzero-is-successor]]).

[L2] $\sigma(m) + i = \sigma(m + i)$ (the left successor law, [[lem-nat-add-successor-left]]) and $m + \sigma(i) = \sigma(m + i)$ (the addition recursion).

[L3] Cancellation: $x + k = y + k \Rightarrow x = y$ ([[lem-nat-add-cancellative]]).

[L4] $\sigma(x) \ne 0$ for every $x$ (Peano axiom P1) ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]).

[L5] Addition is commutative: $x + y = y + x$ ([[lem-nat-add-commutative]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Forward: if $m < n$ then $m \le n$ and $m \ne n$, so $m + j = n$ for some $j$, with $j \ne 0$ since $j = 0$ would give $m = n$; then $j = \sigma(i)$ [L1] and $n = m + \sigma(i) = \sigma(m + i) = \sigma(m) + i$ [L2], hence $\sigma(m) \le n$. [given, L1, L2]

1.2 Backward: if $\sigma(m) \le n$ then $\sigma(m) + i = n$, so $n = \sigma(m) + i = \sigma(m + i) = m + \sigma(i)$ [L2], hence $m \le n$; and $m \ne n$, since $m = n$ would give $m + \sigma(i) = m = m + 0$, so $\sigma(i) + m = 0 + m$ by [L5] and $\sigma(i) = 0$ by [L3], contradicting [L4]; therefore $m < n$. [given, L2, L3, L4, L5]

2.1 No $k$ satisfies $n < k < \sigma(n)$: if $n < k$ then $\sigma(n) \le k$ by the equivalence, so $k \ge \sigma(n)$, contradicting $k < \sigma(n)$; thus $\sigma(n)$ is the immediate successor. [step 1.1, step 1.2] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$, with
$|x|$ the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]). Then

$$|x| \ge 0; \quad |x| = 0 \iff x = 0; \quad -|x| \le x \le |x|; \quad |-x| = |x|; \quad |xy| = |x|\,|y|;$$

and, for every $c > 0$, one has $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and elements $x, y \in F$.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| = u$ if $u \ge 0$, and $|u| = -u$ if $u < 0$ ([[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Ordered-field order: trichotomy holds (for each $u$ exactly one of $u > 0$, $u = 0$, $u < 0$), $a < b$ means $b - a$ is positive, and sums and products of positives are positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Signs in products: $(-a)b = -(ab)$ and $(-a)(-b) = ab$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] Sign rules: a product of two elements of the same sign is positive, and a product of two elements of opposite sign is negative ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Case $x > 0$: by [L1] $|x| = x > 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; since $-x < 0$ we get $|-x| = -(-x) = x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -x < 0 < x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case pos, L1, L2, algebra]

1.2 Case $x = 0$: then $|x| = |0| = 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ holds with $|x| = 0$ and $x = 0$, while $|-x| = |0| = |x|$ and $-|x| = 0 \le 0 \le 0 = |x|$. [assume-case zero, L1]

1.3 Case $x < 0$: by [L1] $|x| = -x$, and [L2] gives $-x > 0$, so $|x| > 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; here $|-x| = -x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -(-x) = x \le x$ while $x < 0 < -x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case neg, L1, L2, algebra]

1.4 Case $x = 0$ or $y = 0$: then $xy = 0$, so $|xy| = 0$, and one of $|x|, |y|$ is $0$, whence $|x|\,|y| = 0 = |xy|$. [assume-case zerofactor, L1]

1.5 Case $x, y$ have the same sign (both positive or both negative): by [L4] $xy > 0$, so $|xy| = xy$, while $|x|\,|y| = xy$ by [L3] (for $x, y < 0$ this is $(-x)(-y) = xy$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case same, L1, L3, L4]

1.6 Case $x, y$ have opposite signs (one positive, one negative): by [L4] $xy < 0$, so $|xy| = -(xy)$, while $|x|\,|y| = -(xy)$ by [L3] (namely $x(-y)$ or $(-x)y$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case opposite, L1, L3, L4]

2.1 By trichotomy [L2] each $x$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.1-1.3, and in each we verified $|x| \ge 0$, that $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$, that $|-x| = |x|$, and that $-|x| \le x \le |x|$; hence all four hold for every $x$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, cases-exhaustive]

2.2 By trichotomy [L2] each pair $x, y$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.4-1.6, and in each $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$ for all $x, y$. [step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6, cases-exhaustive]

3.1 Let $c > 0$: if $|x| < c$ then $-c < -|x| \le x \le |x| < c$ by [step 2.1] and [L2], so $-c < x < c$; conversely if $-c < x < c$ then both $x < c$ and $-x < c$, and since $|x|$ equals $x$ or $-x$ by [L1], we get $|x| < c$, so $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$. [step 2.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b, c, d \in F$.

1. **Translation invariance.** If $a < b$ then $a + c < b + c$.
2. **Adding inequalities.** If $a < b$ and $c < d$ then $a + c < b + d$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b, c, d \in F$.

[L1] For $x, y \in F$, the relation $x < y$ means $y - x \in P$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] $P$ is closed under addition: if $u, v \in P$ then $u + v \in P$ (axiom O2 of [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a < b$; by the definition of the order this means $b - a \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.2 For every $c \in F$ the field identities give $(b + c) - (a + c) = b - a$. [algebra]

1.3 Assume moreover $c < d$; by the definition of the order this means $d - c \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.4 The field identities give $(b + d) - (a + c) = (b - a) + (d - c)$. [algebra]

2.1 Hence $(b + c) - (a + c) = b - a \in P$, which is exactly $a + c < b + c$, proving claim 1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1]

2.2 Since $b - a \in P$ and $d - c \in P$, closure under addition gives $(b - a) + (d - c) \in P$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, L2]

3.1 Therefore $(b + d) - (a + c) = (b - a) + (d - c) \in P$, which is exactly $a + c < b + d$, proving claim 2. [step 1.4, step 2.2, L1] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field, with field structure as in [[def-field]], and for
$n \ge 1$ let $n \cdot 1_F$ denote the canonical natural number
$\underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$, defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$
and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$. Then for every $n \ge 1$:

- $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$;
- the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$;
- $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ and $(mn) \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F)$ for all $m, n \ge 1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ whose canonical naturals are defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, with $0 \cdot 1_F = 0$.

[L1] $0 < 1_F$ in every ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] The order is compatible with addition and positives are closed under addition: $a < b$ implies $a + c < b + c$, and $a > 0$, $b > 0$ imply $a + b > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 1$: by definition $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, and $1_F > 0$. [L1, base]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: assume $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for some fixed $n \ge 1$. [ih]

1.3 By the recursion, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F - n \cdot 1_F = 1_F > 0$, so $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$. [given, L1]

1.4 Additive identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ by the recursion, and if $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ then $(m+n+1) \cdot 1_F = (m+n) \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + (n+1) \cdot 1_F$. [given, algebra]

2.1 Inductive step: $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ is a sum of two positives, by the hypothesis and $1_F > 0$, hence $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Iterating 1.3, for $m < n$ one has $m \cdot 1_F < n \cdot 1_F$, so $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing and therefore injective on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$. [step 1.3, L2]

2.3 Multiplicative identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m \cdot 1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(1 \cdot 1_F)$, and the step $(m(n+1)) \cdot 1_F = (mn + m) \cdot 1_F = (mn) \cdot 1_F + m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F) + (m \cdot 1_F)(1_F) = (m \cdot 1_F)((n+1) \cdot 1_F)$ uses 1.4 and distributivity. [step 1.4, algebra]

3.1 By induction on 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for every $n \ge 1$; with the strict increase 2.2 and the identities 1.4, 2.3, every claim holds. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 1.4, step 2.3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $(x_k)$, $(y_k)$ be
sequences in $F$, with convergence in $F$, Cauchyness in $F$, boundedness and
subsequences as in [[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]]. Then:

1. **Limits are unique.** If $x_k \to L$ and $x_k \to L'$ in $F$, then $L = L'$.
   A convergent sequence therefore has exactly one limit in $F$ and the notation
   $\lim_k x_k$ denotes it unambiguously. This is the licence under which the
   remaining clauses are written as equations between limits, and it is not new
   here: [[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]] already establishes it, in an
   arbitrary ordered field and with no completeness or Archimedean hypothesis.
   It is restated as clause 1 so that this lemma is self-contained as the
   citation target of the whole abstract chain on this page.
2. **Limits preserve non-strict inequalities.** If $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ both
   converge in $F$ and $x_k \le y_k$ for every $k$, then

   $$\lim_k x_k \;\le\; \lim_k y_k .$$

3. **Convergent implies Cauchy.** If $(x_k)$ converges in $F$, it is Cauchy in
   $F$.
4. **Cauchy implies bounded.** If $(x_k)$ is Cauchy in $F$, it is bounded.
5. **A Cauchy sequence with a convergent subsequence converges.** If $(x_k)$ is
   Cauchy in $F$ and some subsequence $(x_{n_j})$ converges in $F$, then $(x_k)$
   converges in $F$ as well, and

   $$\lim_k x_k \;=\; \lim_j x_{n_j} .$$

   Both sides are asserted to exist: the right-hand side by hypothesis, the
   left-hand side as part of the conclusion.

**Why this is a separate item.** Each of the five is proved in this library for
sequences of *reals*, and none of those proofs may be cited here.
[[rem-sequence-conventions]] is explicit about it: a theorem about sequences of
reals is a theorem about $\mathbb{R}$, and the fact that its argument would
transfer to an arbitrary ordered field is a statement about the argument, not a
licence to cite the result. The five are collected here, proved from the ordered
field axioms alone, so that the completeness equivalences of this page have one
place to cite instead of five inline reconstructions.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and sequences $(x_k)$, $(y_k)$ in $F$. Each of the five claims is proved under its own stated hypotheses; nothing is assumed of $(x_k)$ or $(y_k)$ outside the claim being proved.

[L1] Sequences in an ordered field: $(x_k)$ converges to $L$ in $F$ when for every $\varepsilon > 0$ in $F$ there is $N \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_k - L| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge N$; $(x_k)$ is Cauchy in $F$ when for every $\varepsilon > 0$ in $F$ there is $N \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge N$; $(x_k)$ is bounded when there is $M \in F$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for every $k$; and a subsequence of $(x_k)$ is a sequence $(x_{n_j})_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ for a strictly increasing $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Triangle inequality: $|u + v| \le |u| + |v|$ for $u, v \in F$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L3] Absolute value: $|u| \ge 0$; $|u| = 0$ if and only if $u = 0$; $|-u| = |u|$; and $u \le |u|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L4] Order in $F$: exactly one of $u < v$, $u = v$, $v < u$ holds, so the order is total, and both $<$ and $\le$ are transitive; adding a constant preserves the strict order and two strict inequalities may be added ([[lem-of-add-order]]); the nonstrict forms of those two, used below, are the strict forms together with the equality cases, which trichotomy settles ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] Halving: $0 < 1_F$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]), so $2 \cdot 1_F = 1_F + 1_F > 0$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]) and $2 \cdot 1_F$ is nonzero, hence invertible with $(2 \cdot 1_F)^{-1} > 0$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]). Writing $\varepsilon/2$ for $\varepsilon \cdot (2 \cdot 1_F)^{-1}$, an $\varepsilon > 0$ gives $\varepsilon/2 > 0$ and $\varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L6] Induction principle on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L7] Growth of an index map: a strictly increasing $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ satisfies $n_j \ge j$ for every $j$ ([[lem-index-map-grows]]).

[L8] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total and transitive, so of any two indices one is $\ge$ the other, and every index $k$ satisfies $k \le N$ or $k \ge N$ ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 If $d \in F$ satisfies $d < \varepsilon$ for every $\varepsilon > 0$ in $F$, then $d \le 0$: were $d > 0$, the instance $\varepsilon = d$ would give $d < d$, which trichotomy forbids, so $d > 0$ fails and totality leaves $d \le 0$. [L4, algebra]

1.2 For every $\varepsilon > 0$ in $F$ one has $\varepsilon/2 > 0$ and $\varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$. [L5]

1.3 **Claim 1.** Assume $x_k \to L$ and $x_k \to L'$, and let $\varepsilon > 0$ in $F$ be arbitrary; choose $N_1$ with $|x_k - L| < \varepsilon/2$ for $k \ge N_1$, choose $N_2$ with $|x_k - L'| < \varepsilon/2$ for $k \ge N_2$, and let $N$ be whichever of $N_1, N_2$ is the larger. [L1, L8, choose]

1.4 **Claim 2.** Assume $x_k \to L$, $y_k \to M$ and $x_k \le y_k$ for every $k$, and let $\varepsilon > 0$ in $F$ be arbitrary; choose $N_1$ with $|x_k - L| < \varepsilon/2$ for $k \ge N_1$, choose $N_2$ with $|y_k - M| < \varepsilon/2$ for $k \ge N_2$, and let $N$ be the larger of the two. [L1, L8, choose]

1.5 **Claim 3.** Assume $x_k \to L$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ in $F$ be arbitrary; choose $N$ with $|x_k - L| < \varepsilon/2$ for all $k \ge N$. [L1, choose]

1.6 **Claim 4.** For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there is $B \in F$ with $|x_j| \le B$ for all $j \le n$, by induction on $n$: for $n = 0$ take $B = |x_0|$; and given such a $B$ for $n$, totality of the order on $F$ gives either $|x_{n+1}| \le B$, in which case the same $B$ serves for $n + 1$, or $B < |x_{n+1}|$, in which case $|x_{n+1}|$ serves for $n+1$ by transitivity. [L1, L4, L6]

1.7 **Claim 4, continued.** Assume $(x_k)$ is Cauchy; since $1_F > 0$, choose $N$ with $|x_k - x_l| < 1_F$ for all $k, l \ge N$, so that for $k \ge N$ one has $|x_k| = |(x_k - x_N) + x_N| \le |x_k - x_N| + |x_N| < 1_F + |x_N|$. [L1, L2, L4, L5, choose]

1.8 **Claim 5.** Assume $(x_k)$ is Cauchy and $x_{n_j} \to L$ along a strictly increasing $n$, and let $\varepsilon > 0$ in $F$ be arbitrary; choose $N_1$ with $|x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon/2$ for $k, l \ge N_1$, choose $N_2$ with $|x_{n_j} - L| < \varepsilon/2$ for $j \ge N_2$, and let $N$ be the larger of the two, so that $n_N \ge N \ge N_1$ and $N \ge N_2$. [L1, L7, L8, choose]

2.1 For every $k \ge N$ in the situation of step 1.3: $|L - L'| = |(L - x_k) + (x_k - L')| \le |L - x_k| + |x_k - L'| = |x_k - L| + |x_k - L'| < \varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$. [step 1.2, step 1.3, L2, L3, L4]

2.2 For every $k \ge N$ in the situation of step 1.4: $L - M = (L - x_k) + (x_k - y_k) + (y_k - M)$, where $L - x_k \le |L - x_k| < \varepsilon/2$ and $y_k - M \le |y_k - M| < \varepsilon/2$ and $x_k - y_k \le 0$; adding, $L - M < \varepsilon$. [step 1.2, step 1.4, L3, L4]

2.3 For all $k, l \ge N$ in the situation of step 1.5: $|x_k - x_l| = |(x_k - L) + (L - x_l)| \le |x_k - L| + |x_l - L| < \varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$. [step 1.2, step 1.5, L2, L3, L4]

2.4 In the situation of steps 1.6 and 1.7, let $B$ be a bound for $|x_j|$ over $j \le N$ and set $M := B + 1_F + |x_N|$; then $B \ge |x_0| \ge 0$ and $1_F + |x_N| > 0$, so $M \ge B$ and $M \ge 1_F + |x_N|$, whence $|x_k| \le B \le M$ for $k \le N$ and $|x_k| < 1_F + |x_N| \le M$ for $k \ge N$; as every index satisfies $k \le N$ or $k \ge N$, $(x_k)$ is bounded. [step 1.6, step 1.7, L1, L3, L4, L8]

2.5 For every $k \ge N$ in the situation of step 1.8: $|x_k - L| = |(x_k - x_{n_N}) + (x_{n_N} - L)| \le |x_k - x_{n_N}| + |x_{n_N} - L| < \varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$, the first summand being covered because $k \ge N \ge N_1$ and $n_N \ge N_1$. [step 1.2, step 1.8, L2, L4]

3.1 By step 2.1 the element $|L - L'|$ is below every $\varepsilon > 0$, so $|L - L'| \le 0$; with $|L - L'| \ge 0$ this forces $|L - L'| = 0$ and hence $L = L'$, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L3, L4]

3.2 By step 2.2 the element $L - M$ is below every $\varepsilon > 0$, so $L - M \le 0$, that is $L \le M$, which is claim 2. [step 1.1, step 2.2, L4]

3.3 Step 2.3 produced, for an arbitrary $\varepsilon > 0$, an $N$ beyond which all pairs are within $\varepsilon$, so $(x_k)$ is Cauchy in $F$, which is claim 3. [step 2.3, L1]

4.1 Step 2.5 produced, for an arbitrary $\varepsilon > 0$, an $N$ beyond which $|x_k - L| < \varepsilon$, so $(x_k)$ converges in $F$ with $x_k \to L$; since also $x_{n_j} \to L$, step 3.1 identifies both limits as $L$ and gives $\lim_k x_k = \lim_j x_{n_j}$, which is claim 5. [step 2.5, step 3.1, L1]

5.1 Claims 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are steps 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 2.4 and 4.1 respectively, so all five hold. [step 2.4, step 3.1, step 3.2, step 3.3, step 4.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Nothing above uses the Archimedean property, and nothing above uses
  completeness.** The five claims hold in every ordered field, including
  $\mathbb{R}(t)$ and $\mathbb{R}((t^{-1}))$. That is what makes them safe to
  use on both sides of every implication proved on this page.

- **Claim 2 is genuinely non-strict.** From $x_k < y_k$ at every index one gets
  only $L \le M$: the sequences $x_k = 0$ and $y_k = \varepsilon/(k+1)$ in an
  Archimedean $F$ have $x_k < y_k$ and equal limits. The real-number version of
  this warning is recorded at [[lem-limit-preserves-order]].

- **There is deliberately no arithmetic clause here.** Nothing above lets one
  add, multiply or divide two limits in a general ordered field, and no item in
  this library does: [[thm-algebra-of-limits]] is stated for sequences of reals,
  and by the rule recalled above it may not be cited for a general $F$. No proof
  on this page needs such a clause; every abstract argument here works with the
  defining $\varepsilon$ and $N$ directly, or with clauses 1 to 5.

- **Claim 4 avoids any appeal to a maximum of a finite set.** The library's
  finite-maximum lemma [[lem-finite-set-has-max]] is stated for $\mathbb{R}$,
  so it is unavailable here for the same reason the other four real-valued
  lemmas are; step 1.6 replaces it by an induction that uses nothing but
  totality of the order of $F$.
