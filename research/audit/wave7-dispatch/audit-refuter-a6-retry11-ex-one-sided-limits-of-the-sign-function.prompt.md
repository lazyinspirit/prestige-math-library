You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as a
read-only adversarial proof-refuter for the published-page audit. You are
tool-less: you cannot open a file, run a command, browse, edit, or delegate.
Everything you may rely on is reproduced in the `This dispatch` section. Return
evidence only; Audit-Alpha alone adjudicates and edits.

## Triage — the standing rule (verbatim, binding on you)

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct
  citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

## Adversarial standard

Read the target's title, Statement/Definition/Example/Statement refuted, Facts &
Assumptions, every numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks.
Try to falsify the public claim and every load-bearing inference.

1. Compare every cited fact with the supplied source text before alleging that
   it is weak. Check domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, direction, conclusion,
   and whether the source licenses the exact use.
2. Check that the title and public statement assert no more than the proof
   establishes, and that every proof step uses only available premises.
3. Check both directions of biconditionals, uniqueness/existence claims,
   induction and limiting arguments, empty/zero/endpoint/degenerate cases,
   extended-real conventions, index shifts, and hidden division or choice.
4. Re-read Remarks as skeptically as a numbered step. A false mathematical
   remark is a defect even when the proof is sound.
5. When the target is marked `ai-generated`, actively search for a
   counterexample to its claim, witness, or refutation rather than merely
   checking prose consistency.
6. Treat a false public claim, logically invalid proof, missing necessary
   hypothesis, circularity, or materially inaccurate load-bearing citation as
   fatal. Do not inflate an expository omission or a gap closable within thirty
   seconds into a defect.

## Output format

Reply with exactly this structure and no preamble:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

If `DEFECTS`, give one block per finding:

```text

  location: [exact title, section, fact label, or numbered step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [the exact mathematical assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, missing hypothesis, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]
```

Then always end with:

```text

## Example

Define $\operatorname{sgn} : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ by

$$\operatorname{sgn}(x) := \begin{cases} 1 & x > 0, \\ 0 & x = 0, \\ -1 & x < 0. \end{cases}$$

Then $0$ is a limit point of both $(0,\infty)$ and $(-\infty,0)$, both one-sided
limits at $0$ exist ([[def-one-sided-limits]]),

$$\lim_{x \to 0^{+}} \operatorname{sgn}(x) = 1, \qquad \lim_{x \to 0^{-}} \operatorname{sgn}(x) = -1 ,$$

and $\operatorname{sgn}$ has **no** limit at $0$.

This is the standard illustration of
[[thm-two-sided-limit-iff-both-one-sided]]: the two one-sided limits both exist,
so nothing is missing on either side, yet they disagree, and disagreement is
exactly what the theorem converts into the failure of the two-sided limit. Note
also that the value $\operatorname{sgn}(0) = 0$ is equal to neither one-sided
limit, and is irrelevant to all three assertions ([[def-function-limit]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The function $\operatorname{sgn} : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ above, with $A := \mathbb{R}$, $c := 0$, $A^{+} = \mathbb{R} \cap (0,\infty) = (0,\infty)$ and $A^{-} = \mathbb{R} \cap (-\infty,0) = (-\infty,0)$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L1] The limit condition ([[def-function-limit]]): $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = P$ means that for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x$ in the domain with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|f(x) - P| < \varepsilon$.

[L2] One-sided limits are the limits at $c$ of the restrictions of $f$ to $A^{-}$ and $A^{+}$, and are well posed exactly when $c$ is a limit point of the set in question ([[def-one-sided-limits]]).

[L3] Limit point and neighbourhoods ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L4] Absolute value: $|0| = 0$; $|u| \ge 0$; $|u| = u$ for $u \ge 0$ and $|u| = -u$ for $u \le 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L5] Order in $\mathbb{R}$: trichotomy, so every real satisfies exactly one of $x > 0$, $x = 0$, $x < 0$; $0 < 1$ and hence $2 > 0$, $\varepsilon/2 > 0$ and $\varepsilon/2 < \varepsilon$ for $\varepsilon > 0$; and $1 - (-1) = 1 + 1 > 0$, so $-1 < 1$ and in particular $1 \ne -1$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L6] Two-sided versus one-sided: if $c$ is a limit point of both $A^{-}$ and $A^{+}$ and $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$, then $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) = L$ and $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x) = L$ ([[thm-two-sided-limit-iff-both-one-sided]]).

[L7] At a limit point of its domain a function has at most one limit ([[lem-function-limit-unique]]); applied to the restrictions, each one-sided limit is a single real.

## Verification

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $\operatorname{sgn}$ is a well-defined function on $\mathbb{R}$: by trichotomy every real satisfies exactly one of the three defining conditions. [L5]

1.2 $0$ is a limit point of $A^{+} = (0,\infty)$ and of $A^{-} = (-\infty,0)$: given a real $\varepsilon > 0$, the real $\varepsilon/2$ is positive, hence lies in $A^{+}$, and satisfies $0 < |\varepsilon/2 - 0| = \varepsilon/2 < \varepsilon$; and $-\varepsilon/2$ is negative, hence lies in $A^{-}$, and satisfies $0 < |-\varepsilon/2 - 0| = \varepsilon/2 < \varepsilon$. [L3, L4, L5]

1.3 The reals $1$ and $-1$ are distinct, since $1 - (-1) = 1 + 1 > 0$. [L5]

2.1 $\lim_{x \to 0^{+}} \operatorname{sgn}(x) = 1$: by [L2] this is the limit at $0$ of the restriction of $\operatorname{sgn}$ to $A^{+}$, which is well posed by step 1.2. Given a real $\varepsilon > 0$, any $\delta > 0$ serves, since every $x \in A^{+}$ has $x > 0$, hence $\operatorname{sgn}(x) = 1$ and $|\operatorname{sgn}(x) - 1| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1, L2, L4]

2.2 $\lim_{x \to 0^{-}} \operatorname{sgn}(x) = -1$: identically, every $x \in A^{-}$ has $x < 0$, hence $\operatorname{sgn}(x) = -1$ and $|\operatorname{sgn}(x) - (-1)| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ for every $\varepsilon > 0$ and every $\delta > 0$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1, L2, L4]

3.1 Suppose $\operatorname{sgn}$ had a limit at $0$, say $\lim_{x \to 0} \operatorname{sgn}(x) = L$. Since $0$ is a limit point of both $A^{-}$ and $A^{+}$ by step 1.2, [L6] gives $\lim_{x \to 0^{-}} \operatorname{sgn}(x) = L$ and $\lim_{x \to 0^{+}} \operatorname{sgn}(x) = L$; each one-sided limit is single valued by [L7], so steps 2.1 and 2.2 force $L = 1$ and $L = -1$, contradicting step 1.3. Hence $\operatorname{sgn}$ has no limit at $0$. [step 1.3, step 2.1, step 2.2, L6, L7] ∎

## Remarks

- **The failure is not about the value at $0$.** Redefining $\operatorname{sgn}(0)$ to be $1$, or $-1$, or anything else changes nothing: [[def-function-limit]] never evaluates the function at the point, and the two one-sided limits are computed on sets that exclude $0$ ([[def-one-sided-limits]]). This is a genuine jump, not a removable defect of the kind [[fs-limit-equals-value]] exhibits.

- **Away from $0$ the function is locally constant**, so it has a limit at every other point of $\mathbb{R}$, equal to its value there: for $c > 0$ take $\delta$ to be $c$ itself, and every $x$ with $0 < |x - c| < c$ has $x > 0$ and $\operatorname{sgn}(x) = 1 = \operatorname{sgn}(c)$; symmetrically for $c < 0$. So the single point $0$ carries the whole phenomenon.

- **Contrast with the two other failures on this page.** Here both one-sided limits exist and differ; for $\psi(1/x)$ at $0$ ([[cex-psi-of-one-over-x-has-no-limit-at-zero]]) the failure is already one-sided, both witnessing sequences there having positive terms; and for the indicator of $\mathbb{Q}$ ([[cex-dirichlet-has-no-limit-anywhere]]) the failure occurs at every point at once.

Drop the requirement and the implication can be satisfied\n   vacuously by *every* real $L$ at once, which is exactly what\n   [[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]] records. At a point of $A$\n   that is not a limit point of $A$ — an isolated point — the symbol\n   $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x)$ is therefore **not defined** in this library.\n\n2. **$c \\in A$ is not required.** A limit point of $A$ need not belong to $A$\n   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and the definition never evaluates $f$ at $c$. This\n   is what allows a limit to be taken at a point where the function is not\n   defined at all, as at $0$ for $x \\mapsto x\\,\\psi(1/x)$.\n\n3. **The value $f(c)$, when it exists, is irrelevant.** The hypothesis\n   $0 < |x - c|$ excludes $x = c$ from the quantifier, so changing $f$ at the\n   single point $c$ changes nothing. Equality of the limit with the value is an\n   extra condition, not a consequence: [[fs-limit-equals-value]].\n\n**The notation presumes uniqueness.** Writing $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = L$ treats\nthe left-hand side as a name for a single real number, which is legitimate only\nbecause at a limit point at most one $L$ can satisfy the displayed condition.\nThat obligation is discharged by [[lem-function-limit-unique]], recorded in this\nitem's `justified_by`.

## Statement refuted

Write $\mathbb{Q}$ for the canonical copy of the rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$
([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), $X := \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$ for the
irrationals, and let

$$\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}} : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad \mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(x) := \begin{cases} 1 & x \in \mathbb{Q}, \\ 0 & x \in X. \end{cases}$$

**Refuted claim:** there is a point $c \in \mathbb{R}$ at which
$\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ has a limit ([[def-function-limit]]).

The refutation fixes an arbitrary real $c$ and produces two sequences tending to
$c$, one of rationals and one of irrationals, both avoiding $c$; the image
sequences are constantly $1$ and constantly $0$, and
[[cor-sequential-criterion-for-nonexistence]] applies. Since $c$ was arbitrary,
the function has a limit nowhere.

**Where the choice principle enters, and where it does not.** Producing the two
sequences is a use of [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]], whose
left-to-right direction spends countable choice, and that cost is inherited here
and recorded by that item. The criterion applied afterwards is the choice-free
one ([[cor-sequential-criterion-for-nonexistence]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The canonical copy $\mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ of the rationals, the irrationals $X = \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$, the function $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ above, and an arbitrary real $c$.

[L1] Density: $\mathbb{Q}$ and $X$ are both dense in $\mathbb{R}$, that is, each has closure $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]); and the closure of a set $S$ is exactly the set of points every neighbourhood of which meets $S$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L2] Sequential characterisation of the closure: $x$ lies in the closure of $S$ if and only if there is a sequence with all terms in $S$ converging to $x$ ([[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]], [[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]). The direction used below, from the closure to a sequence, is the one that spends countable choice, as that item records.

[L3] Neighbourhoods: $N_{\rho}(u) = \{\, y : |y - u| < \rho \,\}$ for real $\rho > 0$, so $N_{\varepsilon/2}(c + \varepsilon/2) = \{\, y : c < y < c + \varepsilon \,\}$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L4] Nonexistence criterion: if two sequences with all terms in $A \setminus \{c\}$ converge to $c$ while the image sequences converge to distinct reals, then the function has no limit at $c$ ([[cor-sequential-criterion-for-nonexistence]]).

[L5] Every real is a limit point of $\mathbb{R}$, punctured neighbourhoods being never empty ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L6] A constant sequence converges to its value ([[def-real-limit]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L7] Absolute value and order: $|u| \ge 0$ and $|u| = u$ for $u \ge 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]); $0 < 1$, so $2 > 0$, $\varepsilon/2 > 0$ and $\varepsilon/2 < \varepsilon$ for $\varepsilon > 0$; trichotomy and totality ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $c \in \mathbb{R}$ be arbitrary. Then $c$ is a limit point of $\mathbb{R}$, the domain of $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$, so the question of a limit at $c$ is well posed. [L5]

1.2 Let $S$ be either $\mathbb{Q}$ or $X$, and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real. Applying [L1] at the real $c + \varepsilon/2$ with the radius $\varepsilon/2 > 0$, the neighbourhood $N_{\varepsilon/2}(c + \varepsilon/2)$ meets $S$; and by [L3] every $y$ in that neighbourhood satisfies $c < y < c + \varepsilon$, hence $y \ne c$ and $0 < |y - c| < \varepsilon$. So every neighbourhood of $c$ meets $S \setminus \{c\}$. [L1, L3, L7]

2.1 By [L1] again, step 1.2 says exactly that $c$ lies in the closure of $\mathbb{Q} \setminus \{c\}$ and in the closure of $X \setminus \{c\}$. Hence [L2] supplies a sequence $(q_k)$ with all terms in $\mathbb{Q} \setminus \{c\}$ converging to $c$, and a sequence $(u_k)$ with all terms in $X \setminus \{c\}$ converging to $c$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, choose]

3.1 Every term of $(q_k)$ lies in $\mathbb{Q}$, so $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(q_k) = 1$ for every $k$ and the image sequence is the constant sequence $1$, converging to $1$; every term of $(u_k)$ lies in $X$, so $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(u_k) = 0$ for every $k$ and that image sequence converges to $0$. The reals $1$ and $0$ are distinct. [step 2.1, L6, L7]

4.1 Both sequences have all their terms in $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{c\}$ and converge to $c$, while their image sequences converge to distinct reals; by [L4] the function $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ has no limit at $c$. Since $c \in \mathbb{R}$ was arbitrary, it has a limit at no point of $\mathbb{R}$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 3.1, L4] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the sets are punctured before the sequences are drawn.** [[cor-sequential-criterion-for-nonexistence]] requires all terms to lie in $A \setminus \{c\}$, since a sequence allowed to take the value $c$ would report on $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(c)$, which the limit ignores ([[def-function-limit]]). Step 1.2 therefore verifies density of $\mathbb{Q} \setminus \{c\}$ and of $X \setminus \{c\}$ directly, by placing the auxiliary neighbourhood strictly to the right of $c$.

- **The two densities are not proved the same way.** $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense because it is built to approximate; $X$ is dense because a countable set cannot exhaust an interval. Both are claims 1 and 2 of [[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]], and this item uses them only through the neighbourhood formulation of [L1].

- **The failure is as total as possible.** Not merely does the limit fail at some points: it fails at every point of $\mathbb{R}$, while the function is bounded throughout, taking only the values $0$ and $1$. Multiplying by $x$ leaves exactly one point where a limit survives, which is [[ex-x-times-dirichlet-has-a-limit-only-at-zero]].

## Statement refuted

**Refuted claim:** the function

$$\Phi : \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\} \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad \Phi(x) := \psi(1/x) ,$$

with $\psi$ the distance to the integers ([[ex-distance-to-the-integers]]), has a
limit at $0$ ([[def-function-limit]]).

$\Phi$ is bounded — $0 \le \Phi(x) \le 1/2$ for every $x \ne 0$, by claim 2 of
[[ex-distance-to-the-integers]] — and $0$ is a limit point of its domain, so
every hypothesis that might plausibly deliver a limit except the limit itself is
present. Boundedness near a point is therefore **not** sufficient for a limit to
exist, and the converse of [[lem-limit-implies-local-boundedness]] fails.

The refutation exhibits two sequences of positive reals tending to $0$ along
which $\Phi$ is constantly $0$ and constantly $1/2$, and applies
[[cor-sequential-criterion-for-nonexistence]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The function $\Phi(x) = \psi(1/x)$ on $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$, and the sequences $x_k := 1/(k+1)$ and $y_k := 2/(2k+1)$ for $k \in \mathbb{N}$. Sequences are functions on $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-natural-numbers]]), so the first terms are $x_0 = 1$ and $y_0 = 2$; the denominators $k+1$ and $2k+1$ are canonical naturals $\ge 1$, never $0$, which is why the sequences are written this way and not as $1/k$.

[L1] The function $\psi$ vanishes exactly on $\mathbb{Z}$, satisfies $\psi(m + 1/2) = 1/2$ for every $m \in \mathbb{Z}$, and takes values in $[0,1/2]$ ([[ex-distance-to-the-integers]], claims 2, 3 and 4).

[L2] Nonexistence criterion: if two sequences with all terms in $A \setminus \{c\}$ converge to $c$ while the image sequences converge to distinct reals, then $f$ has no limit at $c$ ([[cor-sequential-criterion-for-nonexistence]]).

[L3] Sequential convergence, and the fact that a constant sequence converges to its value ([[def-real-limit]], [[def-sequence]]). Testing against every positive real rather than every positive rational defines the same relation ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]], remarks of [[def-sequence]]).

[L4] Reciprocal Archimedean property: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]]); canonical naturals are positive and strictly increasing in the index ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]); and $0 < a < b$ gives $0 < 1/b < 1/a$, with the non-strict form following by adjoining equality ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

[L5] Limit point and neighbourhoods ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L6] Absolute value ([[lem-of-abs-value]]); order and field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 > 0$ and $1/2 > 0$ with $1/2 \ne 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L7] Integers in $\mathbb{R}$: every canonical natural is an integer, and $\mathbb{Z}$ is closed under adding $1$ ([[def-integers]], [[lem-nat-embeds-int]], [[lem-int-embeds-rat]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]], [[thm-int-comm-ring]]).

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $0$ is a limit point of $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$: given a real $\varepsilon > 0$, the real $\varepsilon/2$ is positive, hence lies in $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$, and $0 < |\varepsilon/2 - 0| = \varepsilon/2 < \varepsilon$. [L5, L6]

1.2 For every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ the terms $x_k = 1/(k+1)$ and $y_k = 2/(2k+1)$ are defined and positive, since $k + 1 \ge 1 > 0$ and $2k + 1 \ge 1 > 0$; in particular $x_k \ne 0$ and $y_k \ne 0$, so both sequences have all their terms in $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$, which equals $(\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}) \setminus \{0\}$. [L4, L6, L7]

1.3 The reals $0$ and $1/2$ are distinct, since $1/2 > 0$. [L6]

2.1 $x_k \to 0$: given a real $\varepsilon > 0$, [L4] supplies a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$; every $k \ge n$ has $k + 1 > n \ge 1$, hence $|x_k - 0| = 1/(k+1) < 1/n < \varepsilon$. [step 1.2, L3, L4, L6]

2.2 $y_k \to 0$: for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ we have $2k + 1 \ge k + 1$, since their difference is $k \ge 0$, so $0 < y_k = 2/(2k+1) \le 2/(k+1)$. Given a real $\varepsilon > 0$, [L4] supplies a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon/2$; every $k \ge n$ has $k + 1 > n$, hence $|y_k - 0| \le 2/(k+1) < 2/n < \varepsilon$. [step 1.2, L3, L4, L6]

2.3 $\Phi(x_k) = 0$ for every $k$: $1/x_k = k + 1$, a canonical natural and hence an integer by [L7], so $\psi(1/x_k) = 0$ by [L1]. The image sequence is therefore the constant sequence $0$ and converges to $0$. [step 1.2, L1, L3, L7]

2.4 $\Phi(y_k) = 1/2$ for every $k$: $1/y_k = (2k+1)/2 = k + 1/2$ with $k$ an integer by [L7], so $\psi(1/y_k) = 1/2$ by [L1]. The image sequence is therefore the constant sequence $1/2$ and converges to $1/2$. [step 1.2, L1, L3, L6, L7]

3.1 So $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ have all their terms in $(\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}) \setminus \{0\}$ and both converge to $0$, which is a limit point of $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$, while the image sequences converge to the distinct reals $0$ and $1/2$. By [L2], $\Phi$ has no limit at $0$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, L2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Both witnessing sequences have positive terms**, so what is refuted is already the existence of the *right-hand* limit $\lim_{x \to 0^{+}} \Phi(x)$ ([[def-one-sided-limits]]), and the two-sided failure follows. The contrast with the sign function on this page is exact: there both one-sided limits exist and merely disagree.

- **Why $1/(k+1)$ and $2/(2k+1)$.** They are the sequences whose reciprocals are $k+1$ and $k + 1/2$, that is, the integers and the half-integers, which are precisely the two sets on which claims 3 and 4 of [[ex-distance-to-the-integers]] evaluate $\psi$ exactly. Writing $1/k$ instead would be undefined at the index $k = 0$, since $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$ ([[def-sequence]]).

- **Multiplying by $x$ repairs it.** The function $x \mapsto x\,\psi(1/x)$ does have a limit at $0$, namely $0$, by the squeeze theorem ([[ex-x-times-psi-tends-to-zero]]). The oscillation is unchanged; what changes is that its amplitude is forced to $0$.

- **The classical form of this counterexample** uses $\sin(1/x)$ in place of $\psi(1/x)$; [[rem-classical-oscillator-is-sine-of-one-over-x]] records why this library cannot yet write it.

## Statement

In any ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, the multiplicative identity
satisfies $0 < 1$; that is, $1 \in P$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$ and multiplicative identity $1$ ([[def-field]]).

[L1] In any field $1 \neq 0$ ([[def-field]]).

[L2] For every $x \neq 0$ the square satisfies $x^2 > 0$ ([[lem-of-square-positive]]).

[L3] The identity axiom gives $1 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1^2$ ([[def-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By the field axioms $1 \neq 0$, and $1 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1^2$. [L1, L3]

2.1 Since $1 \neq 0$, applying the square lemma with $x = 1$ gives $1^2 > 0$. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 Because $1 = 1^2$, it follows that $1 > 0$, i.e. $0 < 1$. [step 2.1, step 1.1, L3] ∎

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) with its order and absolute value
([[def-real-order]]).

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$, let $c \in \mathbb{R}$
be a **limit point** of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and let $L \in \mathbb{R}$.
We say that **$f(x)$ tends to $L$ as $x$ tends to $c$**, and write

$$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L ,$$

when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ 0 < |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - L| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

where $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ range over the **positive reals**.

In the language of neighbourhoods ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]) the condition reads:
for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ with

$$f\bigl(A \cap N^{*}_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \;\subseteq\; N_{\varepsilon}(L),$$

$N^{*}_{\delta}(c) = \{\, y : 0 < |y - c| < \delta \,\}$ being the punctured
$\delta$-neighbourhood of $c$ and $N_{\varepsilon}(L) = (L - \varepsilon,\ L +
\varepsilon)$ the open interval of [[def-interval]]. The two forms agree because
$|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ says exactly $f(x) \in N_\varepsilon(L)$, and
$0 < |x - c| < \delta$ says exactly $x \in N^{*}_\delta(c)$.

**Three features of this definition are load bearing, not decoration.**

1. **$c$ is required to be a limit point of $A$.** By [[def-limit-point-r]] that
   says every punctured neighbourhood of $c$ meets $A$, so for every $\delta > 0$
   the set $A \cap N^{*}_\delta(c)$ over which the implication quantifies is
   nonempty. Drop the requirement and the implication can be satisfied
   vacuously by *every* real $L$ at once, which is exactly what
   [[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]] records. At a point of $A$
   that is not a limit point of $A$ — an isolated point — the symbol
   $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ is therefore **not defined** in this library.

2. **$c \in A$ is not required.** A limit point of $A$ need not belong to $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and the definition never evaluates $f$ at $c$. This
   is what allows a limit to be taken at a point where the function is not
   defined at all, as at $0$ for $x \mapsto x\,\psi(1/x)$.

3. **The value $f(c)$, when it exists, is irrelevant.** The hypothesis
   $0 < |x - c|$ excludes $x = c$ from the quantifier, so changing $f$ at the
   single point $c$ changes nothing. Equality of the limit with the value is an
   extra condition, not a consequence: [[fs-limit-equals-value]].

**The notation presumes uniqueness.** Writing $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$ treats
the left-hand side as a name for a single real number, which is legitimate only
because at a limit point at most one $L$ can satisfy the displayed condition.
That obligation is discharged by [[lem-function-limit-unique]], recorded in this
item's `justified_by`. As with $\sup S$ ([[rem-sup-conventions]]) and
$\lim_k x_k$ ([[lem-limit-unique]]), the symbol is written only for a function
already known to have a limit at $c$.

**Real and rational $\varepsilon$ define the same relation.** Above,
$\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ range over the positive reals. Restricting either
quantifier to the positive rationals gives the same relation: every positive
rational is a positive real, and below every positive real lies a positive
rational ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), so an $\varepsilon$-condition verified for
all positive rationals is verified for an arbitrary positive real $\eta$ by
running it at a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, and a
$\delta$ produced as a real may be shrunk to a rational one below it. This is
the passage sanctioned in the remarks of [[def-sequence]], and it is what lets
this definition be compared with [[def-real-limit]], whose $\varepsilon$ is
rational, in [[thm-sequential-criterion-for-function-limits]].

## Remarks

- **Terminology.** *Limit point* here is a property of the set $A$ and the point
  $c$, in the sense of [[def-limit-point-r]]; it has nothing to do with
  subsequential limits ([[def-subsequential-limit]]), and the distinction is the
  one that item records.

- **Why the punctured condition, and not $|x - c| < \delta$.** With the
  unpunctured condition the definition would force $f$ to be defined at $c$ and
  would force $|f(c) - L| < \varepsilon$ for every $\varepsilon$, that is,
  $L = f(c)$. The resulting notion is continuity at $c$, a strictly stronger
  condition, and conflating the two is the error catalogued in
  [[fs-limit-equals-value]].

- **One-sided and infinite variants.** Restricting the domain to one side of $c$
  gives the one-sided limits of [[def-one-sided-limits]]; replacing the
  conditions on $x$ or on $f(x)$ by unboundedness conditions gives the limits at
  and to infinity of [[def-limits-at-infinity]]. Both are built on this
  definition rather than beside it.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]] and closure as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]].

- $x$ is an **adherent point** of $A$ when $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne
  \varnothing$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$.
- $x$ is a **limit point** (or *accumulation point*) of $A$ when
  $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every real
  $\varepsilon > 0$: every punctured neighbourhood of $x$ meets $A$.
- $x$ is an **isolated point** of $A$ when $x \in A$ and there is a real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$.
- The **derived set** of $A$ is
  $$A' \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \text{ is a limit point of } A \,\}.$$
- $A$ is **dense in $\mathbb{R}$** when $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$.

**A limit point is an adherent point**, since $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq
N_\varepsilon(x)$; and an element of $A$ is an adherent point of $A$, since
$x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). So the adherent
points of $A$ are exactly the points of $A \cup A'$, a statement proved as part
of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

**Limit point and isolated point are exact opposites inside $A$.** For
$x \in A$: $x$ is an isolated point of $A$ exactly when it is not a limit point
of $A$. Indeed $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$ says precisely that
$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, because $x$ itself always lies in
$N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ when $x \in A$; so the existence of an $\varepsilon$
witnessing isolation is the negation of the condition defining a limit point.
A point of $A$ is therefore either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$, and
never both.

**A limit point need not belong to the set, and a point of the set need not be a
limit point.** Both possibilities occur, and the two examples that matter later
are $0$, which is a limit point of $\{\, 1/k : k \ge 1 \,\}$ without belonging
to it, and $0$ again, which belongs to $\{0\} \cup [1,2]$ as an isolated point.

## Remarks

- **Terminology: *limit point* here is about a set, never about a sequence.**
  This library reserves *subsequential limit* for the sequential notion
  ([[def-subsequential-limit]]), and the two are genuinely different: the
  constant sequence $x_k = 0$ has $0$ as a subsequential limit, while its set of
  values $\{0\}$ has no limit point at all. The distinction is the one
  [[def-subsequential-limit]] records under "Terminology", and it is respected
  throughout this page.

- **Density is defined through the closure, not through intervals.** Saying
  $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$ is equivalent to saying that every nonempty open
  subset of $\mathbb{R}$ meets $A$, and also to saying that every neighbourhood
  of every real meets $A$; the equivalences follow from
  [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] and are used in that form in
  [[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]].

- **The derived set need not be comparable with the set.** It can be strictly
  larger, as for $\mathbb{Q}$: every punctured neighbourhood of any real
  contains a rational, since density supplies one strictly between $x$ and
  $x + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]), so the derived set of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is all of $\mathbb{R}$. It can be strictly smaller, as for
  $\{0\}$, whose derived set is empty; and it can be neither, as for
  $\{0\} \cup (1,2)$, whose derived set is $[1,2]$, a set containing points
  outside the original and omitting the point $0$ of it. A closed set satisfying
  $A \subseteq A'$ is called perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]).

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]) and its absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]).

Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ with
$\varepsilon > 0$. The **$\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\},$$

and the **punctured $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \;=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}.$$

The two descriptions of $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ agree because $|y - x| = 0$ holds
exactly when $y = x$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**A neighbourhood is an open interval.** For every $x$ and every
$\varepsilon > 0$,

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;=\; (x - \varepsilon,\ x + \varepsilon),$$

the interval of [[def-interval]]. Indeed [[lem-of-abs-value]] gives, for
$\varepsilon > 0$, the equivalence $|y - x| < \varepsilon \iff -\varepsilon <
y - x < \varepsilon$, and adding $x$ throughout turns the right-hand side into
$x - \varepsilon < y < x + \varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**The centre lies in its own neighbourhoods.** $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, since
$|x - x| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**Punctured neighbourhoods are never empty.** The element
$y := x + \varepsilon/2$ satisfies $|y - x| = \varepsilon/2$, which is
$> 0$ and $< \varepsilon$, so $y \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$
([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

**Monotonicity in the radius.** If $0 < \delta \le \varepsilon$ then
$N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, because $|y - x| < \delta \le
\varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**Nesting at an interior point.** If $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and
$0 < \delta \le \varepsilon - |y - x|$, then

$$N_\delta(y) \;\subseteq\; N_\varepsilon(x).$$

Indeed for $z \in N_\delta(y)$ the triangle inequality
([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]) gives
$|z - x| = |(z - y) + (y - x)| \le |z - y| + |y - x| < \delta + |y - x| \le
\varepsilon$. Note that $\varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ precisely because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, so such a $\delta$ always exists.

## Remarks

- **The radius is a real number, not a rational.** Nothing on this page tests a
  condition against rational radii only. That convention belongs to
  [[def-real-limit]], where the quantifier is over rational $\varepsilon$ and
  the passage between the rational and the real form is the sanctioned remark of
  [[def-sequence]]. Here $\varepsilon$ ranges over the positive reals
  throughout, and every statement above is proved for an arbitrary positive
  real.

- **Why the punctured version is separated out.** A limit point of a set is a
  point every punctured neighbourhood of which meets the set
  ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and deleting the centre is exactly what stops a point
  of the set from qualifying automatically. The unpunctured condition defines
  the weaker notion of an adherent point, and the difference between the two is
  precisely an isolated point.

- **Nesting is the workhorse.** Almost every openness verification on this page
  has the shape "given $y$ in the set, shrink the radius by the distance
  already travelled", which is the nesting property above. It is recorded here
  once so that no later proof has to redo the triangle inequality in passing.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in
\mathbb{R}$. Put

$$A^{-} := A \cap (-\infty, c), \qquad A^{+} := A \cap (c, \infty)$$

([[def-interval]]), and write $f^{-} := f|_{A^{-}}$ and $f^{+} := f|_{A^{+}}$
for the restrictions of $f$ to those sets.

**Right limit.** Suppose $c$ is a limit point of $A^{+}$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]).
For $L \in \mathbb{R}$ we write

$$\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x) = L \quad :\Longleftrightarrow \quad \lim_{x \to c} f^{+}(x) = L$$

in the sense of [[def-function-limit]]. Written out: for every real
$\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that

$$|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon \qquad \text{for every } x \in A \text{ with } c < x < c + \delta .$$

**Left limit.** Suppose $c$ is a limit point of $A^{-}$. For $L \in \mathbb{R}$
we write $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) = L$ when $\lim_{x \to c} f^{-}(x) = L$; written
out, for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ with
$|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ for every $x \in A$ with $c - \delta < x < c$.

**The written-out forms agree with the definitions.** For $x \in A^{+}$ the two
conditions $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ and $c < x < c + \delta$ are the same: $x > c$
gives $x - c > 0$, so $|x - c| = x - c$ and $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ reads
$0 < x - c < \delta$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]). Symmetrically on the left, where
$x < c$ gives $|x - c| = c - x$.

**Well-posedness is inherited, not reproved.** A one-sided limit *is* a limit,
namely the limit of a restriction, so:

- **Uniqueness.** At most one $L$ can occur, by [[lem-function-limit-unique]]
  applied to $f^{+}$ on the domain $A^{+}$ (respectively to $f^{-}$ on
  $A^{-}$), which is legitimate exactly because $c$ was required to be a limit
  point of that set. This is what makes the notation $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$
  denote a single real.
- **Locality and restriction.** Both claims of [[lem-limit-is-local]] apply
  verbatim to $f^{+}$ and $f^{-}$.

**When the symbols are defined.** If $c$ is not a limit point of $A^{+}$ — for
instance if $A$ contains no point to the right of $c$, or only points bounded
away from $c$ on that side — then $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$ is **not defined**
here, for the reason given in [[def-function-limit]]: the
$\varepsilon$-$\delta$ condition would be satisfied vacuously by every real at
once. The same applies on the left.

## Remarks

- **Neither one-sided limit requires $c \in A$, and neither looks at $f(c)$.**
  Both properties are inherited from [[def-function-limit]], since $c \notin
  A^{-} \cup A^{+}$: the point $c$ belongs to neither $(-\infty, c)$ nor
  $(c, \infty)$.

- **The two one-sided limits and the two-sided limit.** When $c$ is a limit
  point of both $A^{-}$ and $A^{+}$, the two-sided limit exists exactly when
  both one-sided limits exist and agree, and then all three coincide:
  [[thm-two-sided-limit-iff-both-one-sided]]. When $c$ is a limit point of only
  one of the two sets, that one-sided limit and the two-sided limit are the same
  condition, again by claim 2 of [[lem-limit-is-local]] together with the
  observation that $A$ and that one side have the same points in a small enough
  punctured neighbourhood of $c$.

- **Notation.** Some texts write $f(c+)$ and $f(c-)$ for these values. This
  library writes only $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$ and $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x)$,
  because the shorter notation looks like an evaluation of $f$ and these
  quantities are not values of $f$: they are defined without reference to
  $f(c)$, which may not even exist.

## Definition

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ ([[def-field]]) together with a subset
$P \subseteq F$, the set of **positive** elements (the *positive cone*),
satisfying:

- **(O1) Trichotomy.** For each $x \in F$, exactly one of the following holds:
  $x \in P$, or $x = 0$, or $-x \in P$.
- **(O2) Closure.** If $x, y \in P$ then $x + y \in P$ and $x \cdot y \in P$.

We write $x > 0$ for $x \in P$ (read "$x$ is positive"), and define the order by

$$a < b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; b - a \in P, \qquad a \le b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; a < b \text{ or } a = b.$$

Thus $a > b$ means $b < a$, and $a \ge b$ means $b \le a$. An element $x$ with
$-x \in P$ (equivalently $x < 0$) is called **negative**.

## Remarks

- By trichotomy applied to $b - a$, for any $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$,
  $a = b$, $a > b$ holds; this makes $\le$ a total order.
- (O2) says the positives are closed under addition and multiplication: sums and
  products of positives are positive.
- The rationals ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and both constructions of the reals
  ([[thm-reals-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-dedekind-ordered-field]]) are ordered
  fields, so every fact proved here from (O1)-(O2) holds in each of them.

## Statement

**False claim:** if $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, if $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$, if
$c \in A$ is a limit point of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]) and if the limit of $f$
at $c$ exists ([[def-function-limit]]), then

$$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c) .$$

Both sides of the asserted equation are defined under the stated hypotheses: the
left because the limit is assumed to exist and is single valued
([[lem-function-limit-unique]]), the right because $c \in A$. The claim is that
they always agree, and that is false.

**Why it is tempting.** The condition $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ is imposed on
points $x$ arbitrarily close to $c$, and it feels as though $x = c$ were the
limiting case of that. It is not: [[def-function-limit]] quantifies over
$0 < |x - c| < \delta$, and the strict inequality on the left removes $x = c$
from the quantifier entirely. Changing the value of $f$ at the single point $c$
therefore changes nothing on the left-hand side and everything on the right.

**What is true.** The equation above is not a theorem but a *condition*, and it
is the condition the next page of this track takes as the definition of
continuity at $c$. This library states it as a hypothesis and never as a
consequence; hypothesis (i) of [[thm-composition-of-function-limits]] is exactly
this condition for the outer function.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The set $A := \mathbb{R}$, the point $c := 0$, and the function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x) := 0$ for $x \ne 0$ and $f(0) := 1$.

[L1] The limit condition: $\lim_{x \to c} h(x) = L$ means that for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x$ in the domain of $h$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|h(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ ([[def-function-limit]]).

[L2] Limit point: $c$ is a limit point of $S$ when every punctured neighbourhood $N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c)$ meets $S$; and punctured neighbourhoods in $\mathbb{R}$ are never empty ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] Absolute value: $|0| = 0$, and $|u| \ge 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L4] Order in $\mathbb{R}$: trichotomy, so every real either equals $0$ or does not, and never both; and $0 < 1$, so $1 \ne 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The point $c = 0$ lies in $A = \mathbb{R}$ and is a limit point of $\mathbb{R}$: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the punctured neighbourhood $N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(0)$ is nonempty and is contained in $\mathbb{R}$, so it meets $\mathbb{R}$. [L2]

1.2 $f$ is a well-defined function on $\mathbb{R}$, since by trichotomy every real either equals $0$ or does not, exclusively; and the reals $0$ and $1$ are distinct. [L4]

2.1 The limit of $f$ at $0$ exists and equals $0$: given an arbitrary real $\varepsilon > 0$, take $\delta := 1 > 0$; every $x \in \mathbb{R}$ with $0 < |x - 0| < 1$ has $|x| \ne 0$, hence $x \ne 0$, hence $f(x) = 0$ and $|f(x) - 0| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1, L3, L4]

3.1 Yet $f(0) = 1$, and $1 \ne 0 = \lim_{x \to 0} f(x)$. So at the point $c = 0$ of the domain, which is a limit point of the domain, the limit exists and differs from the value: the claim is false. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L4] ∎

## Remarks

- **The witness is the smallest possible one.** It differs from a constant function at exactly one point, and the limit cannot see that point. Any function agreeing with a constant off $c$ and taking a different value at $c$ would serve equally well; the companion page works this witness out in full, computes its one-sided limits, and shows that redefining the single value repairs the equality.

- **Where the false claim does hold.** Under the extra hypothesis that $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$ — which is what continuity at $c$ will mean — it holds trivially, and that is the only sense in which it is ever true. It is emphatically not a consequence of the limit existing.

- **The consequence for composition.** Because $f(c)$ is invisible to the limit, substituting an inner function that takes the value $c$ is not licensed by the limits alone; that is the content of [[fs-naive-composition-of-limits]], whose witness is built from this one.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$, let $c$ be a limit
point of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]) and let $L, L' \in \mathbb{R}$. If

$$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L \qquad \text{and} \qquad \lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L'$$

([[def-function-limit]]), then $L = L'$.

A function therefore has **at most one** limit at a limit point of its domain,
which is what licenses the notation $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ for a single real
number. This lemma is recorded in the `justified_by` field of
[[def-function-limit]] for exactly that reason.

**The hypothesis that $c$ is a limit point is not removable.** At an isolated
point of the domain the same $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula is satisfied
vacuously by every real at once, which is the content of
[[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$, a limit point $c$ of $A$, and reals $L, L'$ with $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$ and $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L'$ ([[def-function-limit]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L1] The limit condition: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$, and likewise with $L'$ in place of $L$ ([[def-function-limit]]).

[L2] Limit point: for every real $\delta > 0$ there is $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] Triangle inequality: $|u + v| \le |u| + |v|$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L4] Absolute value: $|u| \ge 0$; $|u| = 0$ if and only if $u = 0$; and $|-u| = |u|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L5] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: trichotomy, so $u \ne 0$ together with $|u| \ge 0$ and $|u| \ne 0$ forces $|u| > 0$, and $t < t$ is impossible; adding two strict inequalities ([[lem-of-add-order]]); $0 < 1$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]), hence $2 := 1 + 1 > 0$ and $2^{-1} > 0$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]), so $\eta/2 > 0$ and $(\eta/2) \cdot 2 = \eta$ whenever $\eta > 0$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]]); and of two positive reals the smaller is positive, the order being total.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $L \ne L'$. [assume-contra]

2.1 Then $L - L' \ne 0$, so $|L - L'| \ne 0$ while $|L - L'| \ge 0$, and trichotomy gives $|L - L'| > 0$; hence $\varepsilon := |L - L'|/2 > 0$ and $2\varepsilon = |L - L'|$. [step 1.1, L4, L5]

3.1 Applying [L1] twice with this $\varepsilon$, fix reals $\delta_1 > 0$ and $\delta_2 > 0$ such that every $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta_1$ has $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ and every $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta_2$ has $|f(x) - L'| < \varepsilon$; put $\delta$ to be the smaller of $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$, so $\delta > 0$. [step 2.1, L1, L5, choose]

4.1 Since $c$ is a limit point of $A$, fix $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$. [step 3.1, L2, choose]

5.1 That $x$ satisfies $0 < |x - c| < \delta_1$ and $0 < |x - c| < \delta_2$, hence both $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ and $|f(x) - L'| < \varepsilon$. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L1]

6.1 Therefore $|L - L'| = |(L - f(x)) + (f(x) - L')| \le |L - f(x)| + |f(x) - L'| = |f(x) - L| + |f(x) - L'| < \varepsilon + \varepsilon = 2\varepsilon = |L - L'|$. [step 5.1, L3, L4, L5]

7.1 So $|L - L'| < |L - L'|$, which trichotomy forbids; the assumption $L \ne L'$ is untenable, and hence $L = L'$. [step 6.1, L5, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where each hypothesis is spent.** The limit conditions are used only in step 5.1, and the limit-point hypothesis only in step 4.1, to produce a *single* point $x$ of the domain near $c$ at which both estimates can be read. Without such a point the two estimates never meet and nothing forces $L = L'$; that is the whole mechanism, and it is the reason [[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]] is false.

- **The sequential analogue** is [[lem-limit-unique]], proved by the same two-estimates-at-one-index argument. Neither statement uses any choice principle.

- **One-sided limits inherit this.** By [[def-one-sided-limits]] a one-sided limit is the limit of a restriction of $f$, so applying this lemma to that restriction gives uniqueness there too; nothing has to be reproved.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$, with
$|x|$ the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]). Then

$$|x| \ge 0; \quad |x| = 0 \iff x = 0; \quad -|x| \le x \le |x|; \quad |-x| = |x|; \quad |xy| = |x|\,|y|;$$

and, for every $c > 0$, one has $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and elements $x, y \in F$.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| = u$ if $u \ge 0$, and $|u| = -u$ if $u < 0$ ([[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Ordered-field order: trichotomy holds (for each $u$ exactly one of $u > 0$, $u = 0$, $u < 0$), $a < b$ means $b - a$ is positive, and sums and products of positives are positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Signs in products: $(-a)b = -(ab)$ and $(-a)(-b) = ab$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] Sign rules: a product of two elements of the same sign is positive, and a product of two elements of opposite sign is negative ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Case $x > 0$: by [L1] $|x| = x > 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; since $-x < 0$ we get $|-x| = -(-x) = x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -x < 0 < x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case pos, L1, L2, algebra]

1.2 Case $x = 0$: then $|x| = |0| = 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ holds with $|x| = 0$ and $x = 0$, while $|-x| = |0| = |x|$ and $-|x| = 0 \le 0 \le 0 = |x|$. [assume-case zero, L1]

1.3 Case $x < 0$: by [L1] $|x| = -x$, and [L2] gives $-x > 0$, so $|x| > 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; here $|-x| = -x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -(-x) = x \le x$ while $x < 0 < -x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case neg, L1, L2, algebra]

1.4 Case $x = 0$ or $y = 0$: then $xy = 0$, so $|xy| = 0$, and one of $|x|, |y|$ is $0$, whence $|x|\,|y| = 0 = |xy|$. [assume-case zerofactor, L1]

1.5 Case $x, y$ have the same sign (both positive or both negative): by [L4] $xy > 0$, so $|xy| = xy$, while $|x|\,|y| = xy$ by [L3] (for $x, y < 0$ this is $(-x)(-y) = xy$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case same, L1, L3, L4]

1.6 Case $x, y$ have opposite signs (one positive, one negative): by [L4] $xy < 0$, so $|xy| = -(xy)$, while $|x|\,|y| = -(xy)$ by [L3] (namely $x(-y)$ or $(-x)y$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case opposite, L1, L3, L4]

2.1 By trichotomy [L2] each $x$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.1-1.3, and in each we verified $|x| \ge 0$, that $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$, that $|-x| = |x|$, and that $-|x| \le x \le |x|$; hence all four hold for every $x$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, cases-exhaustive]

2.2 By trichotomy [L2] each pair $x, y$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.4-1.6, and in each $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$ for all $x, y$. [step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6, cases-exhaustive]

3.1 Let $c > 0$: if $|x| < c$ then $-c < -|x| \le x \le |x| < c$ by [step 2.1] and [L2], so $-c < x < c$; conversely if $-c < x < c$ then both $x < c$ and $-x < c$, and since $|x|$ equals $x$ or $-x$ by [L1], we get $|x| < c$, so $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$. [step 2.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b, c, d \in F$.

1. **Translation invariance.** If $a < b$ then $a + c < b + c$.
2. **Adding inequalities.** If $a < b$ and $c < d$ then $a + c < b + d$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b, c, d \in F$.

[L1] For $x, y \in F$, the relation $x < y$ means $y - x \in P$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] $P$ is closed under addition: if $u, v \in P$ then $u + v \in P$ (axiom O2 of [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a < b$; by the definition of the order this means $b - a \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.2 For every $c \in F$ the field identities give $(b + c) - (a + c) = b - a$. [algebra]

1.3 Assume moreover $c < d$; by the definition of the order this means $d - c \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.4 The field identities give $(b + d) - (a + c) = (b - a) + (d - c)$. [algebra]

2.1 Hence $(b + c) - (a + c) = b - a \in P$, which is exactly $a + c < b + c$, proving claim 1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1]

2.2 Since $b - a \in P$ and $d - c \in P$, closure under addition gives $(b - a) + (d - c) \in P$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, L2]

3.1 Therefore $(b + d) - (a + c) = (b - a) + (d - c) \in P$, which is exactly $a + c < b + d$, proving claim 2. [step 1.4, step 2.2, L1] ∎

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in
\mathbb{R}$ be a limit point of **both** $A^{-} = A \cap (-\infty, c)$ and
$A^{+} = A \cap (c, \infty)$ ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-interval]]), so that
both one-sided limits at $c$ are well posed ([[def-one-sided-limits]]). Then $c$
is a limit point of $A$, and for every $L \in \mathbb{R}$:

$$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) = L \ \text{ and } \ \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x) = L$$

([[def-function-limit]]). Consequently the limit of $f$ at $c$ **exists** if and
only if both one-sided limits exist and are equal, and in that case

$$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) \;=\; \lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) \;=\; \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x) .$$

**The hypothesis on both sides is what makes the statement an equivalence.** If
$c$ is a limit point of only one of the two sets — as $1$ is for
$\{0\} \cup [1,2]$ — then the one-sided limit on that side and the two-sided
limit are the same condition, and the symbol on the other side is not defined at
all ([[def-one-sided-limits]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $c$ that is a limit point of both $A^{-} = A \cap (-\infty, c)$ and $A^{+} = A \cap (c, \infty)$, and a real $L$ ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-interval]], [[def-one-sided-limits]]).

[L1] The limit condition ([[def-function-limit]]): $\lim_{x \to c} h(x) = L$ means that for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x$ in the domain of $h$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|h(x) - L| < \varepsilon$.

[L2] Limit point: $c$ is a limit point of $S$ when for every real $\delta > 0$ there is $x \in S$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] Intervals: $A^{-} = \{\, x \in A : x < c \,\}$ and $A^{+} = \{\, x \in A : x > c \,\}$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L4] Absolute value and order: $|x - c| = 0$ exactly when $x = c$; the order is total, so every $x \ne c$ satisfies $x < c$ or $x > c$; and $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ is equivalent to $c - \delta < x < c$ for $x < c$ and to $c < x < c + \delta$ for $x > c$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]]). Of two positive reals the smaller is positive.

[L5] Restriction: if $B \subseteq A$ has $c$ as a limit point and $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$, then $\lim_{x \to c} f|_B(x) = L$ (claim 2 of [[lem-limit-is-local]]).

[L6] One-sided limits are by definition the limits of the restrictions $f|_{A^{-}}$ and $f|_{A^{+}}$ at $c$ ([[def-one-sided-limits]]).

[L7] At a limit point of its domain a function has at most one limit ([[lem-function-limit-unique]]); applied to $f|_{A^{-}}$ and to $f|_{A^{+}}$ it makes each one-sided limit a single real, and applied to $f$ it does the same for the two-sided limit.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $c$ is a limit point of $A$: it is one of $A^{+}$ by hypothesis, and $A^{+} \subseteq A$, so every point of $A^{+}$ found in a punctured neighbourhood of $c$ is a point of $A$ there. [L2, L3]

1.2 For $x \in A$ the condition $0 < |x - c|$ says exactly $x \ne c$, and then $x < c$ or $x > c$, that is $x \in A^{-}$ or $x \in A^{+}$; moreover for $x \in A^{-}$ the condition $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ reads $c - \delta < x < c$ and for $x \in A^{+}$ it reads $c < x < c + \delta$. [L3, L4]

2.1 Suppose $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$. Both $A^{-}$ and $A^{+}$ are subsets of $A$ having $c$ as a limit point, so [L5] gives $\lim_{x \to c} f|_{A^{-}}(x) = L$ and $\lim_{x \to c} f|_{A^{+}}(x) = L$, which by [L6] is exactly $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) = L$ and $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x) = L$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L5, L6]

2.2 Suppose conversely that both one-sided limits equal $L$, and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real. By [L6] and [L1] fix reals $\delta_1, \delta_2 > 0$ such that every $x \in A^{-}$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta_1$ and every $x \in A^{+}$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta_2$ satisfies $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$; let $\delta$ be the smaller of the two. Every $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ lies in $A^{-}$ or in $A^{+}$ by step 1.2, and in either case $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$. As $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary, $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$. [step 1.2, L1, L4, L6, choose]

3.1 The displayed equivalence is steps 2.1 and 2.2. For the consequence: if the limit of $f$ at $c$ exists, say with value $L$, then step 2.1 gives that both one-sided limits exist with the same value $L$, so they agree; and if both one-sided limits exist and are equal, to the common value $L$, then step 2.2 gives that the limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and equals $L$. Each of the three symbols denotes a single real by [L7], so the three are equal. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L7] ∎

## Remarks

- **The two directions are not symmetric in difficulty.** From the two-sided limit to the one-sided ones is pure restriction, [[lem-limit-is-local]]; the converse has to glue two estimates, and the gluing is legitimate precisely because every point of $A$ other than $c$ lies strictly on one side of $c$, which is the totality of the order.

- **The typical failure** is a function whose two one-sided limits exist and differ: the sign function at $0$, on the companion page. Then the two-sided limit cannot exist, since by step 2.1 it would force both one-sided values to equal it.

- **A function may also have no two-sided limit for a different reason**, namely that a one-sided limit fails to exist rather than that the two disagree. The theorem covers that case too, since its right-hand side asserts the existence of both one-sided values, so its failure on one side alone already blocks the two-sided limit. The companion page exhibits both patterns.
