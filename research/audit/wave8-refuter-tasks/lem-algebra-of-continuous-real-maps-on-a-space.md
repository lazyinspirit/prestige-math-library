## Statement

Let $f,g:X\to\mathbb R$ be continuous maps from a topological space. Then
$f+g$, $fg$, $|f|$, $\max(f,g)$, and $\min(f,g)$ are continuous. On the open
cozero set $\operatorname{coz}(g)$, the quotient $f/g$ is continuous. The same
holds for every finite sum, product, maximum, or minimum of continuous
real-valued maps.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A topological space $X$ and continuous maps $f,g:X\to\mathbb R$.

[L1] A map into a product is continuous exactly when its coordinate maps are continuous, compositions of continuous maps are continuous, and a map whose range lies in a subspace is continuous into that subspace exactly when it is continuous into the ambient space ([[thm-product-universal-property]], [[thm-continuity-characterisations-top]], [[def-subspace-topology-top]]).

[L2] The usual metric on $\mathbb R$ is $d(s,t)=|s-t|$ ([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]).

[F1] $\operatorname{coz}(g)=\{x:g(x)\ne0\}$ is open for continuous $g$ ([[def-zero-sets-and-cozero-sets]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Addition is continuous at $(a,b)$ because $|s-a|,|t-b|<\varepsilon/2$ gives $|(s+t)-(a+b)|<\varepsilon$. Multiplication is continuous there: after requiring $|t-b|<1$, one has $$|st-ab|\le |s-a||t|+|a||t-b| < |s-a|(|b|+1)+|a||t-b|,$$ which is less than $\varepsilon$ when both coordinate errors are smaller than $\varepsilon/(2(|a|+|b|+1))$. These coordinate conditions describe product neighbourhoods, so both operations are continuous. [L2]

2.1 The reverse triangle inequality $\big||s|-|t|\big|\le |s-t|$ makes absolute value continuous. Consequently $$\max\{s,t\}=\frac{s+t+|s-t|}{2},\qquad \min\{s,t\}=\frac{s+t-|s-t|}{2}$$ are continuous by step 1.1 and composition. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.2 Reciprocal is continuous at $b\ne0$: if $|t-b|<|b|/2$, then $|t|>|b|/2$ and $$\left|\frac1t-\frac1b\right| =\frac{|t-b|}{|t||b|}<\frac{2|t-b|}{|b|^2}.$$ Thus division $(s,t)\mapsto s/t$ is the product of $s$ and $1/t$ and is continuous on $\mathbb R\times(\mathbb R\setminus\{0\})$; moreover $\operatorname{coz}(g)$ is open by [F1]. [step 1.1, L1, F1, L2]

3.1 The map $(f,g):X\to\mathbb R^2$ is continuous by [L1], so composing it with the operations of steps 1.1 and 2.1 gives continuity of $f+g$, $fg$, $\max(f,g)$, and $\min(f,g)$; composing $f$ with absolute value gives continuity of $|f|$. [L1, step 1.1, step 2.1]

3.2 Restricting $f$ and $g$ to $\operatorname{coz}(g)$ and composing their product map with division gives continuity of $f/g$ there. [L1, step 2.2]

4.1 Iterating the binary operations of step 3.1 proves the finite assertions. [step 3.1] ∎

## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be topological spaces
([[def-topological-space]]), let $f : X \to Y$ be a function and let $x \in X$.
Neighbourhoods are as in [[def-neighbourhood-top]].

$f$ is **continuous at $x$** if for every neighbourhood $V$ of $f(x)$ in $Y$ the
preimage $f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ in $X$.

$f$ is **continuous** if it is continuous at every point of $X$.

**The same condition with open sets only.** $f$ is continuous at $x$ if and only
if for every open $V \subseteq Y$ with $f(x) \in V$ there is an open
$U \subseteq X$ with $x \in U$ and $f[U] \subseteq V$. Indeed, if $f$ is
continuous at $x$ and $V$ is such an open set, then $V$ is a neighbourhood of
$f(x)$, so $f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ and contains an open $U \ni x$,
which satisfies $f[U] \subseteq V$. Conversely, given the displayed condition and
a neighbourhood $V$ of $f(x)$, fix open $V_0$ with $f(x) \in V_0 \subseteq V$ and
then open $U \ni x$ with $f[U] \subseteq V_0$; then $x \in U \subseteq f^{-1}[V_0] \subseteq f^{-1}[V]$,
so $f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$. Both forms are used below and are the
same statement written twice.

**Preimage, not image.** $f^{-1}[V] = \{\, x \in X : f(x) \in V \,\}$
is the preimage in the sense of [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]] and is
defined for every function, invertible or not; no inverse function is being
asserted to exist. Continuity is a condition on preimages throughout, and the
corresponding conditions on images define the *open* and *closed* maps of a later
item, which are different notions.

## Remarks

- **This is the metric definition when both topologies are metric topologies.**
  For metric spaces, $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ continuity at $a$
  ([[def-metric-continuity]]) says that every ball around $f(a)$ has a ball
  around $a$ mapped into it, and the balls around a point are a neighbourhood
  base there; the identification is carried out where metrizable spaces are
  defined later on this page. Nothing about a metric survives in the definition
  above: continuity is a relation between two topologies and a function, and it
  is meaningless to ask whether a function between bare sets is continuous.

- **Continuity depends on both topologies, and coarsening the target or refining
  the source only helps.** If $f$ is continuous and $\mathcal{T}_X$ is replaced
  by a finer topology, or $\mathcal{T}_Y$ by a coarser one, $f$ remains
  continuous, since each condition to be verified is weakened and each
  neighbourhood available in the source is still available. In particular every
  map out of a discrete space and every map into an indiscrete space is
  continuous ([[def-standard-topologies]]).

- **Continuity at a point is strictly weaker than continuity.** A function may be
  continuous at exactly one point, and the definition above is deliberately local
  so that the sequential criteria proved later can be stated pointwise.

## Definition

**The product set.** Let $I$ be a set and let $X_i$ be a set for each $i \in I$.
The **product** is

$$\prod_{i \in I} X_i \;:=\; \Big\{\, x : x \text{ is a function with domain } I \text{ and } x(i) \in X_i \text{ for every } i \in I \,\Big\},$$

and we write $x_i := x(i)$, the $i$-th **coordinate** of $x$. Two elements of the
product are equal exactly when they agree at every index, functions being equal
when they have the same domain and the same values. For $j \in I$ the $j$-th
**projection** is

$$\pi_j : \prod_{i \in I} X_i \to X_j, \qquad \pi_j(x) := x_j .$$

**Notation for a finite product.** For $I = n$ a natural number, which is the set
$\{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ of its predecessors, an element of $\prod_{k<n} X_k$ is a
function on $n$ and we write it $(x_0, \dots, x_{n-1})$. In particular $I = 2$
gives the **binary product**, written $X \times Y$ for $\prod_{i<2} X_i$ with
$X_0 = X$ and $X_1 = Y$, whose elements are written $(u,v)$ for the function
$0 \mapsto u$, $1 \mapsto v$. This is the only meaning the symbol $X \times Y$
carries on this page.

**Two facts about when the product is nonempty, stated because they are used and
because they cost something.** If some $X_{i_0}$ is empty then the product is
empty, since no function can take a value in $X_{i_0}$. Conversely, suppose every
$X_i$ is nonempty.

- For $I = n$ a natural number, the product is nonempty, and this is a theorem of
  ZF: [[lem-finite-choice]] applied to the function $i \mapsto X_i$ on $n$
  supplies a choice function $g$ for the family of values, and
  $x(i) := g(X_i)$ defines a member of $\prod_{k<n} X_k$.
- For an arbitrary $I$ the assertion "$\prod_{i \in I} X_i \ne \varnothing$
  whenever every $X_i$ is nonempty" **is** the Axiom of Choice: it is the
  formulation recorded in [[def-axiom-of-choice]], and the choice function of
  [[def-choice-function]] is exactly a point of the product of a family by
  itself. Every use of it below is flagged at the step that spends it.

**The box topology.** Now let each $X_i$ carry a topology $\mathcal{T}_i$
([[def-topological-space]]). Put

$$\mathcal{R} \;:=\; \Big\{\, \prod_{i \in I} U_i \;:\; U_i \in \mathcal{T}_i \text{ for every } i \in I \,\Big\},$$

the family of **boxes**. $\mathcal{R}$ is a basis for a topology
([[thm-basis-criterion]]): it contains $\prod_i X_i$, so it covers the product,
and it is closed under binary intersections, since

$$\Big(\prod_i U_i\Big) \cap \Big(\prod_i V_i\Big) = \prod_i (U_i \cap V_i)$$

and each $U_i \cap V_i$ is open by (T3). The topology it generates is the **box
topology** $\mathcal{T}^{\square}$, and $\mathcal{R}$ is a basis for it
([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]).

**The product topology.** The **product topology** $\mathcal{T}^{\Pi}$ on
$\prod_i X_i$ is the initial topology of the family of projections
$(\pi_i)_{i \in I}$ ([[def-initial-and-final-topology]]): the topology generated
by the subbasis

$$\mathcal{G} \;:=\; \{\, \pi_i^{-1}[U] : i \in I,\ U \in \mathcal{T}_i \,\}, \qquad \pi_i^{-1}[U] = \prod_{j \in I} W_j \ \text{ with } W_i = U \text{ and } W_j = X_j \text{ for } j \ne i .$$

By [[thm-basis-criterion]] the finite intersections of members of $\mathcal{G}$
form a basis for $\mathcal{T}^{\Pi}$, and those finite intersections are exactly
the boxes with all but finitely many factors unrestricted:

$$\mathcal{R}^{\Pi} \;=\; \Big\{\, \prod_{i \in I} U_i \;:\; U_i \in \mathcal{T}_i \text{ for every } i, \text{ and } U_i = X_i \text{ for all but finitely many } i \,\Big\}.$$

Indeed the intersection of $\pi_{i_1}^{-1}[U_1], \dots, \pi_{i_n}^{-1}[U_n]$ is
the box whose factor at $i$ is the intersection of those $U_m$ with $i_m = i$ and
is $X_i$ when no $i_m$ equals $i$; and the intersection of no members is the
whole product, the box with every factor $X_i$. Conversely a box with
$U_i = X_i$ off a finite set is such an intersection. Members of
$\mathcal{R}^{\Pi}$ are called **basic product-open** sets, and members of
$\mathcal{R}$ **boxes**. So $\mathcal{R}^{\Pi} \subseteq \mathcal{R}$, with
equality when $I$ is a natural number.

**The empty product.** For $I = \varnothing$ there is exactly one function with
domain $\varnothing$, the empty function, so $\prod_{i \in \varnothing} X_i$ is a
one-point set. A one-point set carries exactly one topology, namely
$\{\varnothing, \{\varnothing\}\}$, since a topology must contain the empty set
and the whole set and there is nothing else to contain
([[def-topological-space]]); so the box topology and the product topology agree
there, and both equal the discrete topology and the indiscrete topology
([[def-standard-topologies]]), which coincide on a one-point set. There are no
projections to speak of, and the initial topology of the empty family is indeed
the indiscrete one ([[def-initial-and-final-topology]]).

**Convention.** Unless the box topology is named explicitly, $\prod_i X_i$ always
carries the product topology in this library. That is not a matter of taste: the
product topology is the one with the characteristic property of the next item,
and the box topology has no such property.

## Remarks

- **Where the two topologies actually differ.** The box topology is finer than
  the product topology by construction, since $\mathcal{R}^{\Pi} \subseteq
  \mathcal{R}$. They agree whenever $I$ is finite; and, assuming the Axiom of Choice, for a
  family of **nonempty** spaces they differ for infinite $I$ as soon as infinitely
  many factors have a nonempty proper open subset. Nonemptiness is not decoration: if one factor is
  empty then the product is empty and carries exactly one topology, so the two
  agree however the other factors are chosen. Both statements are proved two items
  below, with that hypothesis, and the failure is recorded on this page as a false
  statement.

- **The product set is a set of functions, and that is not a technicality.** The
  factors are indexed by an arbitrary set, so there is no "list" to write down;
  writing $x = (x_i)_{i \in I}$ is notation for the function $x$. The finite case
  recovers the familiar tuple, and the identification of $\prod_{k<n}\mathbb{R}$
  with the $\mathbb{R}^n$ of [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] is literal, that item defining
  $\mathbb{R}^n$ as the set of functions $n \to \mathbb{R}$.

- **The projections carry no hypothesis.** They are defined for every product,
  including the empty one and products with an empty factor; what does need a
  hypothesis is their *surjectivity*, which is the point at which choice enters
  and which is stated separately in the next item.

## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]) and let
$S \subseteq X$. The **subspace topology** (also *relative topology*) on $S$ is

$$\mathcal{T}_S := \{\, U \cap S : U \in \mathcal{T} \,\},$$

the family of **traces** on $S$ of the open sets of $X$. The pair
$(S, \mathcal{T}_S)$ is a **subspace** of $X$. A subset of $S$ that lies in
$\mathcal{T}_S$ is said to be **open in $S$**, and *relatively open* where the
ambient space needs emphasis.

**$\mathcal{T}_S$ is a topology, and this is discharged here.** (T1):
$\varnothing = \varnothing \cap S$ and $S = X \cap S$ are traces. (T2): if
$\mathcal{S}' \subseteq \mathcal{T}_S$, choose for each member a set of
$\mathcal{T}$ tracing to it — no choice principle is needed, since
$U' := \bigcup \{\, U \in \mathcal{T} : U \cap S \subseteq W \,\}$ is a canonical
such set for $W \in \mathcal{T}_S$, being open by (T2) in $X$ and satisfying
$U' \cap S = W$ — and then
$\bigcup_i (U_i \cap S) = (\bigcup_i U_i) \cap S \in \mathcal{T}_S$ by (T2) in
$X$. (T3): $(U \cap S) \cap (V \cap S) = (U \cap V) \cap S \in \mathcal{T}_S$ by
(T3) in $X$.

**Closed sets of a subspace are the traces of the closed sets.** A set
$C \subseteq S$ is closed in $S$ if and only if $C = F \cap S$ for some closed
$F \subseteq X$. Indeed $S \setminus (U \cap S) = (X \setminus U) \cap S$ and
$S \setminus (F \cap S) = (X \setminus F) \cap S$, so complementation inside $S$
matches complementation inside $X$ under tracing.

**Bases and subbases trace as well.** If $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for
$\mathcal{T}$ ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]) then
$\mathcal{B}_S := \{\, B \cap S : B \in \mathcal{B} \,\}$ is a basis for
$\mathcal{T}_S$: its members are open in $S$, and for $W = U \cap S$ open in $S$
and $x \in W$ there is $B \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B \subseteq U$, whence
$x \in B \cap S \subseteq W$. The same computation with a subbasis $\mathcal{S}$
shows that $\{\, S_0 \cap S : S_0 \in \mathcal{S} \,\}$ is a subbasis for
$\mathcal{T}_S$, since tracing commutes with finite intersections and with
unions.

**The inclusion is continuous.** The inclusion map $\iota : S \to X$,
$\iota(s) = s$, satisfies $\iota^{-1}[U] = U \cap S$ for every $U \subseteq X$,
so preimages of open sets are open and $\iota$ is continuous
([[thm-continuity-characterisations-top]], clause (b)). Moreover
$\mathcal{T}_S$ is the **coarsest** topology on $S$ making $\iota$ continuous: any
topology on $S$ for which $\iota$ is continuous must contain every
$\iota^{-1}[U] = U \cap S$, hence contain $\mathcal{T}_S$.

**Characteristic property of a map into a subspace.** Let $(Z, \mathcal{T}_Z)$ be
a topological space and let $g : Z \to S$ be a function. Then

$$g \text{ is continuous as a map } Z \to (S,\mathcal{T}_S) \iff \iota \circ g \text{ is continuous as a map } Z \to (X,\mathcal{T}) .$$

*Proof.* For $U \in \mathcal{T}$ one has
$(\iota \circ g)^{-1}[U] = g^{-1}[\iota^{-1}[U]] = g^{-1}[U \cap S]$. If $g$ is
continuous then each $g^{-1}[U \cap S]$ is open, so $\iota \circ g$ is continuous;
conversely if $\iota \circ g$ is continuous then for any $W = U \cap S$ open in
$S$ the set $g^{-1}[W] = (\iota \circ g)^{-1}[U]$ is open, so $g$ is continuous.
Both directions use only clause (b) of [[thm-continuity-characterisations-top]].

**Restriction of a continuous map.** If $f : X \to Y$ is continuous and
$S \subseteq X$, then $f|_S : S \to Y$ is continuous, since
$(f|_S)^{-1}[V] = f^{-1}[V] \cap S$ is open in $S$ for every open $V \subseteq Y$
([[def-continuous-map-top]], [[thm-continuity-characterisations-top]]).

**When relative and ambient agree.** If $S$ is open in $X$ then a subset of $S$
is open in $S$ if and only if it is open in $X$: a trace $U \cap S$ is then an
intersection of two open sets of $X$, and conversely an open subset of $X$
contained in $S$ is its own trace. The same statement with "closed" throughout
holds when $S$ is closed in $X$. Both are used in the pasting lemma of the next
item, and both fail without the hypothesis: $S$ itself is always open and closed
in $S$, and need be neither in $X$.

## Remarks

- **The subspace topology is what makes a subset a space.** Before it, a statement
  such as "the restriction of $f$ to $C$ is continuous" has no meaning, because
  $C$ carries no topology. Every restriction below is taken with respect to the
  subspace topology and with no other convention available.

- **Openness and closedness are not absolute.** $[0,1)$ is open in $[0,2)$ and is
  neither open nor closed in $\mathbb{R}$; the interval $(0,1)$ is closed in
  itself. A sentence of the form "$A$ is open" is incomplete unless the space is
  named, and this library names it whenever more than one is in play.

- **Transitivity.** If $S \subseteq T \subseteq X$ then the subspace topology $S$
  inherits from $(T, \mathcal{T}_T)$ is the subspace topology it inherits from
  $X$, since $(U \cap T) \cap S = U \cap S$ for $U \in \mathcal{T}$. So no
  ambiguity arises from the route by which a subset is reached.

## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]) and let
$\mathbb{R}$ carry its usual topology, the metric topology of
$d_{\mathbb{R}}(s,t) = |s-t|$ ([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]],
[[def-metrizable-space]]). For a continuous $f : X \to \mathbb{R}$
([[def-continuous-map-top]]) put

$$Z(f) \;:=\; f^{-1}[\{0\}] \;=\; \{\, x \in X : f(x) = 0 \,\}, \qquad \operatorname{coz}(f) \;:=\; X \setminus Z(f) \;=\; \{\, x \in X : f(x) \ne 0 \,\} .$$

$Z(f)$ is the **zero set** of $f$ and $\operatorname{coz}(f)$ its **cozero set**.
A subset of $X$ is *a zero set of $X$* when it is $Z(f)$ for some continuous
$f : X \to \mathbb{R}$, and *a cozero set of $X$* when it is the complement of
one. Where the target is written $[0,1]$ ([[def-interval]]) with its subspace
topology ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]), a continuous map $X \to [0,1]$ is the
same thing as a continuous map $X \to \mathbb{R}$ with all values in $[0,1]$, by
the characteristic property of a map into a subspace recorded in
[[def-subspace-topology-top]]; so nothing below depends on which of the two
targets is written.

**Every zero set is closed and every cozero set is open.** $\{0\}$ is closed in
$\mathbb{R}$: its complement $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$ is open, since a point
$t \ne 0$ has the bounded open interval $(t - |t|,\ t + |t|)$ around it inside
$\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$ ([[def-interval]], [[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]],
claim 3). The preimage of a closed set under a continuous map is closed
([[thm-continuity-characterisations-top]], clause (c)).

**Every zero set is a $G_\delta$ and every cozero set an $F_\sigma$**
([[def-g-delta-and-f-sigma-in-a-topological-space]]). Writing $\iota$ for the
canonical natural of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-canonical-natural]]), so that $1/(n+1)$
abbreviates the inverse of $\iota(n+1)$, put

$$V_n \;:=\; f^{-1}\big[\,(-1/(n+1),\ 1/(n+1))\,\big] \qquad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Each $V_n$ is open, being the preimage of an open interval
([[thm-continuity-characterisations-top]], clause (b)). Clearly
$Z(f) \subseteq \bigcap_n V_n$. Conversely, if $f(x) \ne 0$ then
$\varepsilon := |f(x)| > 0$, and [[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]] gives a natural
$k \ge 1$ with $1/k < \varepsilon$; since $k \ne 0$ it is a successor,
$k = n+1$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[lem-nat-nonzero-is-successor]]), so
$|f(x)| > 1/(n+1)$ and $x \notin V_n$. Hence $Z(f) = \bigcap_{n} V_n$ is a
$G_\delta$, and $\operatorname{coz}(f)$ is an $F_\sigma$ by complementation.

**Both extremes occur.** The constant maps are continuous, since the preimage of
any set under a constant map is $\varnothing$ or $X$
([[thm-continuity-characterisations-top]], clause (b)); so $X = Z(0)$ and
$\varnothing = Z(1)$ are zero sets of every space, where $0$ and $1$ denote the
corresponding constant maps.

## Remarks

- **A closed set need not be a zero set, and no witness for that is exhibited
  here.** The zero sets of $X$ are exactly the closed sets that a continuous
  real-valued function can see, and a space may have very few continuous
  real-valued functions: in the indiscrete topology on a set with at least two
  points, every continuous map to $\mathbb{R}$ is constant, because a nonconstant
  one would pull back two disjoint intervals to two disjoint nonempty open sets.
  So the only zero sets there are $\varnothing$ and $X$ — which in that space is
  also all of the closed sets and all of the $G_\delta$ sets, the only open sets
  being $\varnothing$ and $X$. That space therefore illustrates the scarcity of
  continuous functions without separating the two classes; a space with a closed
  set that is not a zero set is not constructed on this page.

- **Where zero sets are used on this page.** They are the vocabulary of complete
  regularity: the defining function separating a point from a closed set $C$
  places $C$ inside a zero set and the point in the corresponding cozero set.
  They also give the sharp form of the metric case, where *every* closed set is a
  zero set.

- **The name.** $\operatorname{coz}$ is the standard notation in the theory of
  rings of continuous functions, where the zero sets of $X$ are the closed sets
  the ring can detect; nothing of that theory is used here.

## Statement

Define $d_{\mathbb{R}} : \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ by
$d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) := |x - y|$ ([[def-abs-value]]). Then:

1. $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ is a metric on $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-metric-space]]); it is
   called the **usual metric** of $\mathbb{R}$.
2. For $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and $r > 0$ the open ball is the bounded open interval
   ([[def-interval]], [[def-metric-ball]])
   $$B(x,r) = (x-r,\ x+r),$$
   and the closed ball is $\bar B(x,r) = [x-r,\ x+r]$.
3. Consequently $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is open in the metric topology of
   $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-metric-topology]]) exactly when for every $x \in U$
   there is $r > 0$ with $(x-r, x+r) \subseteq U$. This topology is called the
   **usual topology** of $\mathbb{R}$.
4. $(\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$ is not a bounded metric space
   ([[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]): no ball contains $\mathbb{R}$, so
   $\operatorname{diam}(\mathbb{R})$ is not defined.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The complete ordered field $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]), and the function $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) = |x-y|$; points $x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}$ and a real $r > 0$.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| \ge 0$; $|u| = 0$ if and only if $u = 0$; $|-u| = |u|$; and for $c > 0$ one has $|u| < c$ if and only if $-c < u < c$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Triangle inequality in an ordered field: $|u + v| \le |u| + |v|$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L3] Intervals: $(a,b) = \{t : a < t < b\}$ and $[a,b] = \{t : a \le t \le b\}$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L4] Archimedean property: for every $w \in \mathbb{R}$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $w < n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); and $n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L5] Adding a constant to an inequality, in strict and nonstrict form: the strict form is [[lem-of-add-order]] and the nonstrict form is that together with the case of equality, the order being total ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L6] Trichotomy: for reals $a,b$ exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Separation (M1): $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) = |x-y| = 0$ holds if and only if $x - y = 0$, that is if and only if $x = y$. [L1]

1.2 Symmetry (M2): $d_{\mathbb{R}}(y,x) = |y-x| = |-(x-y)| = |x-y| = d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y)$. [L1]

1.3 Triangle inequality (M3): $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,z) = |x - z| = |(x-y) + (y-z)| \le |x-y| + |y-z| = d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) + d_{\mathbb{R}}(y,z)$. [L2]

1.4 For $y \in \mathbb{R}$ and $r > 0$: $y \in B(x,r)$ means $|x - y| < r$, which by [L1] holds if and only if $-r < x - y < r$, and adding $y - r$ respectively $y + r$ to the two halves shows this is equivalent to $x - r < y < x + r$. [L1, L5]

1.5 For $y \in \mathbb{R}$ and $r > 0$: $y \in \bar B(x,r)$ means $|x-y| \le r$, which by the same equivalence read with $\le$ in place of $<$ holds if and only if $x - r \le y \le x + r$. [L1, L5]

1.6 Let $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ and $r > 0$ be arbitrary, and use [L4] to fix a natural $n \ge 1$ with $x_0 + r < n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$; write $w := n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$. [L4, choose]

2.1 By steps 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 the function $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ satisfies (M1), (M2) and (M3), so it is a metric on $\mathbb{R}$, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3]

2.2 By step 1.4 and [L3] the set $B(x,r)$ has exactly the elements of $(x-r,x+r)$, and by step 1.5 and [L3] the set $\bar B(x,r)$ has exactly the elements of $[x-r,x+r]$; this is claim 2. [step 1.4, step 1.5, L3]

2.3 Since $r > 0$ we have $x_0 < x_0 + r < w$, so $w - x_0 > r > 0$ and hence $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x_0, w) = |x_0 - w| = |-(w - x_0)| = w - x_0 > r$; therefore $w \notin B(x_0,r)$. [step 1.6, L1, L5, L6]

3.1 Substituting claim 2 into the definition of open in the metric topology gives claim 3: $U$ is open exactly when every $x \in U$ admits $r > 0$ with $(x-r,x+r) = B(x,r) \subseteq U$. [step 2.2]

4.1 Since $x_0$ and $r$ were arbitrary, step 2.3 exhibits for every ball $B(x_0,r)$ a real not in it, so no ball contains $\mathbb{R}$; hence $\mathbb{R}$ is not a bounded subset of itself and $\operatorname{diam}(\mathbb{R})$ is not defined, which is claim 4. [step 2.1, step 2.3] ∎

## Remarks

- **This is the metric every later ceiling rests on.** Every real-line example on the companion page, and every subspace of $\mathbb{R}$ used there, takes its metric from $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ through the subspace construction of [[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]].
- **Unboundedness needs no Archimedean input, and no completeness either.** No ordered field is bounded under $d(u,v) = |u-v|$, and the reason is a single element rather than any cofinality property: given a centre $c$ and a radius $r > 0$, the element $c + r + 1$ satisfies $d(c,\, c + r + 1) = |{-(r+1)}| = r + 1 > r$, because $1 > 0$ and $r + 1 > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]]); so it lies outside $B(c,r)$ and no ball contains the field. Step 1.6 above chooses its witness with [[thm-of-archimedean]] instead, which is a convenience and not a necessity: it delivers a witness that is a canonical natural, and claim 4 needs no such thing. Claim 4 therefore holds verbatim in every ordered field with this $d$, Archimedean or not. Note also that a radius is an element of $\mathbb{R}$, so "a ball of infinite radius" is not something that can be written here.
- **The claim that $\operatorname{diam}(\mathbb{R})$ is "not defined" is a claim about the conventions of this development** ([[rem-sup-conventions]], [[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]): suprema here are real numbers and the extended real line, which is introduced on a later page, is not used for them, so an unbounded set has no diameter at all rather than a diameter $+\infty$.

## Statement

Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be topological spaces, let
$f : X \to Y$ be a function, and let $\mathcal{S}$ be a subbasis for
$\mathcal{T}_Y$ ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]). The following five conditions
are equivalent.

- **(a)** $f$ is continuous at every point of $X$ ([[def-continuous-map-top]]).
- **(b)** $f^{-1}[V]$ is open in $X$ for every open $V \subseteq Y$.
- **(c)** $f^{-1}[F]$ is closed in $X$ for every closed $F \subseteq Y$.
- **(d)** $f^{-1}[S]$ is open in $X$ for every $S \in \mathcal{S}$.
- **(e)** $f[\overline{A}] \subseteq \overline{f[A]}$ for every $A \subseteq X$,
  closures being taken in $X$ and in $Y$ respectively
  ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

Condition (d) is what makes continuity checkable against a generating family
rather than against every open set, and it holds for a *basis* as well, a basis
being in particular a subbasis for the topology it generates.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Topological spaces $(X,\mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y,\mathcal{T}_Y)$, a function $f : X \to Y$, a subbasis $\mathcal{S}$ for $\mathcal{T}_Y$, subsets $A \subseteq X$ and $V, F \subseteq Y$. Preimages satisfy $f^{-1}[Y \setminus W] = X \setminus f^{-1}[W]$, $f^{-1}[\bigcup_i W_i] = \bigcup_i f^{-1}[W_i]$ and $f^{-1}[\bigcap_i W_i] = \bigcap_i f^{-1}[W_i]$ for every family, with $f^{-1}[Y] = X$ for the empty intersection.

[A1] $f$ is continuous at $x$ when for every open $V \ni f(x)$ there is an open $U \ni x$ with $f[U] \subseteq V$ ([[def-continuous-map-top]]).

[A2] A set is closed exactly when its complement is open; a set is open exactly when it is a union of open sets containing each of its points ([[def-topological-space]]).

[L1] The topology generated by $\mathcal{S}$ has as a basis the family $\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S}}$ of intersections of finitely many members of $\mathcal{S}$, the empty intersection being $Y$; every open set is a union of members of $\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S}}$ ([[thm-basis-criterion]], [[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]).

[L2] $x \in \overline{A}$ if and only if every open set containing $x$ meets $A$ ([[thm-closure-characterisation-top]], clause (c)).

[L3] $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed superset of $A$, and $A$ is closed exactly when $A = \overline{A}$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 (a) implies (b): let $V \subseteq Y$ be open and let $x \in f^{-1}[V]$, so $f(x) \in V$; continuity at $x$ gives an open $U \ni x$ with $f[U] \subseteq V$, that is $U \subseteq f^{-1}[V]$. As $x$ was arbitrary, $f^{-1}[V]$ is a union of open sets, hence open. [A1, A2]

1.2 (b) implies (a): let $x \in X$ and let $V$ be open with $f(x) \in V$; then $U := f^{-1}[V]$ is open, contains $x$, and satisfies $f[U] \subseteq V$. [A1]

1.3 (b) and (c) are equivalent: $F \subseteq Y$ is closed exactly when $Y \setminus F$ is open, and $f^{-1}[Y \setminus F] = X \setminus f^{-1}[F]$, so $f^{-1}[F]$ is closed exactly when $f^{-1}[Y \setminus F]$ is open; as $F$ ranges over the closed sets, $Y \setminus F$ ranges over the open sets. [given, A2]

1.4 (b) implies (d): every $S \in \mathcal{S}$ is open, $\mathcal{S}$ being contained in the topology it generates. [L1]

1.5 (d) implies (b): let $V \subseteq Y$ be open; by [L1] $V$ is a union of sets of the form $S_1 \cap \dots \cap S_n$ with $n \ge 0$ and $S_i \in \mathcal{S}$, and $f^{-1}$ turns unions into unions and intersections into intersections, with $f^{-1}[Y] = X$ for $n = 0$; so $f^{-1}[V]$ is a union of finite intersections of the open sets $f^{-1}[S_i]$ together with $X$, hence open. [given, L1, A2]

1.6 (e) implies (c): let $F \subseteq Y$ be closed and put $A := f^{-1}[F]$; then $f[A] \subseteq F$, so $f[\overline{A}] \subseteq \overline{f[A]} \subseteq \overline{F} = F$ by (e), monotonicity of the closure and [L3]; hence $\overline{A} \subseteq f^{-1}[F] = A$, and with $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ this gives $A = \overline{A}$, so $A$ is closed. [L3]

2.1 (b) implies (e): let $A \subseteq X$ and $x \in \overline{A}$, and let $V$ be open with $f(x) \in V$; then $f^{-1}[V]$ is open and contains $x$, so it meets $A$ by [L2], say at $a$; then $f(a) \in V \cap f[A]$, so $V$ meets $f[A]$. As $V$ was arbitrary, $f(x) \in \overline{f[A]}$ by [L2]. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 Steps 1.1 and 1.2 make (a) and (b) equivalent; step 1.3 makes (b) and (c) equivalent; steps 1.4 and 1.5 make (b) and (d) equivalent; step 2.1 gives (b) implies (e) and step 1.6 gives (e) implies (c), which closes the cycle through (c) and (b). Hence all five conditions are equivalent. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, step 1.4, step 1.5, step 2.1, step 1.6] ∎

## Remarks

- **Only (a) is pointwise.** Conditions (b) to (e) are global, and none of them has a pointwise version that is equivalent to continuity at a single point: the preimage of an open set containing $f(x)$ can fail to be open while still being a neighbourhood of $x$, which is exactly what continuity at $x$ asserts.

- **The inclusion in (e) may be strict for a continuous map.** For the inclusion of $(0,1)$ into $\mathbb{R}$ and $A = (0,1)$, the image of the closure is $(0,1)$ while the closure of the image is $[0,1]$. Equality for all $A$ is a strictly stronger condition, equivalent to $f$ being a closed map, and closed maps are defined three items below. Note that no map into a **discrete** space can witness strictness: there every subset is closed, so $f[\overline{A}] = f[A] = \overline{f[A]}$ always.

- **What the theorem does not say.** It says nothing about images of open sets: a continuous map need not carry open sets to open sets, and the failure is exactly what separates a continuous bijection from a homeomorphism. That separation is recorded on this page as a false statement with an explicit two-point witness.

## Statement

Let $(X_i, \mathcal{T}_i)_{i \in I}$ be topological spaces and let
$P := \prod_{i \in I} X_i$ carry the product topology, with projections $\pi_j$
([[def-product-topology]]). Then:

1. **The projections are continuous**, and the product topology is the coarsest
   topology on $P$ making all of them continuous.
2. **Characteristic property.** For every space $Z$ and every function
   $h : Z \to P$,
   $$h \text{ is continuous } \iff \pi_i \circ h \text{ is continuous for every } i \in I .$$
   The functions $\pi_i \circ h$ are the **components** of $h$, and every family
   of functions $h_i : Z \to X_i$ arises from exactly one $h$, namely
   $h(z)(i) := h_i(z)$.
3. **The projections are open maps** ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]), for
   the product topology and for the box topology alike. They need not be closed;
   that failure is recorded on this page as a false statement.
4. **Surjectivity.** If every $X_i$ is nonempty then every $\pi_j$ is surjective.
   For $I$ a natural number this is a theorem of ZF ([[lem-finite-choice]]); for
   an arbitrary $I$ it is the Axiom of Choice ([[def-axiom-of-choice]]), and this
   is the only place in the item where a choice principle is used.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Topological spaces $(X_i,\mathcal{T}_i)_{i \in I}$, the product $P = \prod_{i \in I} X_i$ with the product topology and the projections $\pi_j(x) = x_j$, a space $Z$ and a function $h : Z \to P$, and an index $j \in I$.

[A1] The product topology on $P$ is the initial topology of $(\pi_i)_{i \in I}$, and a basis for it is the family of boxes $\prod_i U_i$ with every $U_i$ open and $U_i = X_i$ for all but finitely many $i$; a basis for the box topology is the family of all boxes $\prod_i U_i$ with every $U_i$ open ([[def-product-topology]], [[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]).

[A2] $f$ is an open map when $f[U]$ is open in the target for every open $U$ in the source ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]).

[L1] For a topology given as an initial topology of a family $(f_i)$: each $f_i$ is continuous, the topology is the coarsest with that property, and a map $h$ into it is continuous exactly when every $f_i \circ h$ is ([[thm-initial-and-final-characteristic-properties]], claims 1 and 2; [[def-initial-and-final-topology]], [[def-continuous-map-top]]).

[L2] If $F$ is a function with domain a natural number $n$ whose values are nonempty sets, then the family of its values has a choice function ([[lem-finite-choice]], [[def-choice-function]]).

[L3] If every member of a family of sets is nonempty then the product of the family is nonempty; this is the Axiom of Choice ([[def-axiom-of-choice]], [[def-choice-function]]).

[L4] The image of a union is the union of the images, and an arbitrary union of open sets is open ([[def-topological-space]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [A1] the product topology is an initial topology, so [L1] gives claim 1 and claim 2 at once, the defining family being $(\pi_i)_{i \in I}$. [A1, L1]

1.2 For a family of functions $h_i : Z \to X_i$ the assignment $h(z)(i) := h_i(z)$ defines a function $Z \to P$, since $h(z)$ has domain $I$ and $h(z)(i) = h_i(z) \in X_i$; it satisfies $\pi_i \circ h = h_i$, and any $h'$ with $\pi_i \circ h' = h_i$ for every $i$ satisfies $h'(z)(i) = h_i(z) = h(z)(i)$ for all $z$ and $i$, hence $h' = h$. [given]

1.3 Let $B = \prod_i U_i$ be a box with every $U_i$ open. If $B = \varnothing$ then $\pi_j[B] = \varnothing$. If $B \ne \varnothing$, fix $b \in B$; then $\pi_j[B] = U_j$, since $\pi_j[B] \subseteq U_j$ by definition, and for $u \in U_j$ the function $y$ with $y_j := u$ and $y_i := b_i$ for $i \ne j$ lies in $B$ and has $\pi_j(y) = u$. [A1, choose]

1.4 Assume every $X_i$ is nonempty and $I$ is a natural number $n$. By [L2] applied to $i \mapsto X_i$ there is a choice function $g$ for the family of values, and $x(i) := g(X_i)$ defines a point of $P$; so $P \ne \varnothing$. [L2]

1.5 Assume every $X_i$ is nonempty and $I$ is arbitrary. By [L3] the product $P$ is nonempty. [L3]

2.1 Both the box topology and the product topology have a basis consisting of boxes, by [A1], and the image of a union of basic sets is the union of their images; so by step 1.3 the image under $\pi_j$ of any open set of either topology is a union of sets each of which is $\varnothing$ or an open $U_j \subseteq X_j$, hence open. This is claim 3. [step 1.3, A1, A2, L4]

2.2 Assume every $X_i$ is nonempty and let $t \in X_j$. By step 1.4 when $I$ is a natural number, and by step 1.5 in general, there is a point $p \in P$; the function $y$ with $y_j := t$ and $y_i := p_i$ for $i \ne j$ then lies in $P$ and satisfies $\pi_j(y) = t$. So $\pi_j$ is surjective, which is claim 4. [step 1.4, step 1.5]

3.1 Step 1.1 gives claims 1 and 2, step 1.2 gives the bijection between maps into $P$ and families of component maps, step 2.1 gives claim 3 and step 2.2 gives claim 4. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.1, step 2.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Exactly where choice is spent, and where it is not.** Openness of the
  projections (claim 3) is choice free: step 1.3 uses a *single* point of the box
  in question, which is given by the assumption that the box is nonempty, and
  builds the required preimage from it by changing one coordinate. Surjectivity
  (claim 4) is different, because there the point has to be produced from nothing
  but nonemptiness of the factors, and for an infinite index set that is the
  Axiom of Choice itself.

- **The characteristic property is what makes the product topology the right
  one.** The box topology has no analogue of claim 2: a map into a box-topologised
  product may have all components continuous and fail to be continuous, and the
  companion page exhibits the diagonal of $\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}$ doing exactly
  that.

- **Openness does not survive to closedness.** A projection is always open and is
  in general not closed, and the standard witness, the hyperbola in
  $\mathbb{R}^2$, is worked in the false statement on this page. There is no
  asymmetry of taste here: images of open boxes are computed coordinatewise,
  while a closed set of the product need not be a union of closed boxes at all.
