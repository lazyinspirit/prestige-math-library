## Statement

Write $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the image of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$
under the canonical embedding $q \mapsto \hat q$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), the
set usually written $\mathbb{Q}$ once the identification is made, and put
$X := \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the irrationals. Then:

1. $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is an $F_\sigma$ set ([[def-f-sigma-g-delta]]) and is
   meager ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]]);
2. $X$ is a $G_\delta$ set and is residual;
3. $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is **not** a $G_\delta$ set, and $X$ is **not** an
   $F_\sigma$ set.

Claims 1 and 2 are bookkeeping. Claim 3 is the substance and is exactly where
[[thm-baire-category-r]] is spent: no argument from the algebra of open and
closed sets alone can reach it, since $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and $X$ are
interchanged by complementation while $F_\sigma$ and $G_\delta$ are, so any such
argument would prove the same thing about both sets and about neither.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The complete ordered field $\mathbb{R}$, the set $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ of rationals and its complement $X = \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$.

[L1] $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-rationals-countable]], [[def-equinumerous]]), $q \mapsto \hat q$ is injective with image $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and a composition of bijections is a bijection ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]); an at most countable family may be presented as a sequence indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ ([[def-countable]]).

[L2] $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]); a set is dense when its closure is $\mathbb{R}$, equivalently when every $N_\varepsilon(x)$ meets it ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]); the closure operator is monotone, so a superset of a dense set is dense ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]).

[L3] $U$ is open when every point of it has a neighbourhood inside it, and $F$ is closed when $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open; $N_\varepsilon(x) = (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon)$ and $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L4] A closed set is nowhere dense exactly when its interior is empty; a meager set is a union of a sequence of nowhere dense sets; residual means the complement is meager ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]]).

[L5] $A$ is $F_\sigma$ when it is the union of a sequence of closed sets and $G_\delta$ when it is the intersection of a sequence of open sets; $A$ is $F_\sigma$ if and only if $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ is $G_\delta$ ([[def-f-sigma-g-delta]]).

[L6] A countable intersection of dense open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ is dense ([[thm-baire-category-r]]).

[L7] There is a bijection $J : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-n-cross-n-countable]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 For $c \in \mathbb{R}$ the singleton $\{c\}$ is closed and nowhere dense: its complement is open, since $x \ne c$ gives $N_{|x-c|}(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus \{c\}$ by [L3]; and its interior is empty, since for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the point $c + \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$ lies in $N_\varepsilon(c)$ and differs from $c$, so no neighbourhood is contained in $\{c\}$, whence $\{c\}$ is a closed set with empty interior and [L4] applies. [L3, L4]

1.2 By [L1] fix a bijection $\beta : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$ and put $e := \iota \circ \beta$ with $\iota(q) = \hat q$, a bijection from $\mathbb{N}$ onto $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$. [L1, choose]

2.1 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \{e(n)\}$, since $e$ is onto $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$; the sets $\{e(n)\}$ are closed and nowhere dense by step 1.1, so $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is $F_\sigma$ by [L5] and meager by [L4]. This is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L4, L5]

3.1 Put $W_n := \mathbb{R} \setminus \{e(n)\}$, an open set by step 1.1 and [L3]. A real $x$ lies in $\bigcap_n W_n$ exactly when $x \ne e(n)$ for every $n$, that is, exactly when $x \notin \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, so $X = \bigcap_n W_n$ and $X$ is $G_\delta$ by [L5]; and $\mathbb{R} \setminus X = \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is meager by step 2.1, so $X$ is residual by [L4]. This is claim 2. Each $W_n$ is also dense, since every $N_\varepsilon(x)$ contains two distinct points and so meets $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{e(n)\}$, by [L2] and [L3]. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.1, L2, L3, L4, L5]

4.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is $G_\delta$, and by [L5] fix a sequence $(V_n)$ of open sets with $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} = \bigcap_n V_n$. Each $V_n$ contains $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, which is dense by [L2], so each $V_n$ is dense by [L2]; and each $W_n$ of step 3.1 is open and dense. [assume-contra, step 3.1, L2, L5, choose]

5.1 By [L7] fix a bijection $J : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ and define a sequence $(D_j)$ by $D_{J(m,n)} := V_n$ when $m = 0$ and $D_{J(m,n)} := W_n$ when $m \ne 0$; this is total because $J$ is a bijection, and every $D_j$ is open and dense by step 4.1. Moreover $\bigcap_j D_j = \big(\bigcap_n V_n\big) \cap \big(\bigcap_n W_n\big) = \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \cap X = \varnothing$, since every $V_n$ and every $W_n$ occurs among the $D_j$ and every $D_j$ is one of them. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L7]

6.1 By [L6] the set $\bigcap_j D_j$ is dense, hence nonempty by [L2] and [L3], contradicting step 5.1. The assumption of step 4.1 is therefore untenable: $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is not $G_\delta$; and $X$ is not $F_\sigma$, since $\mathbb{R} \setminus X = \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ would then be $G_\delta$ by [L5]. This is claim 3. [step 4.1, step 5.1, L2, L3, L5, L6, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the two halves of the argument part company.** Claim 1 is a listing argument and would work equally in $\mathbb{Q}$ or in any countable space; claim 3 uses the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ through [[thm-nested-interval-property]], inside [[thm-baire-category-r]]. Indeed $\mathbb{Q}$ is a $G_\delta$ subset of itself, being the whole space, so no argument that ignores the ambient completeness can possibly give claim 3.

- **The irrationals are also uncountable** ([[cor-irrationals-uncountable]]), by a different and much cheaper argument that needs only the countability of $\mathbb{Q}$ and the uncountability of $\mathbb{R}$. Uncountability and being residual are independent properties: $\mathbb{Q}$ is meager and countable, the Cantor set is meager and uncountable ([[thm-cantor-set-properties]]), and $X$ is residual and uncountable.

- **The named witness for claim 3** is [[cex-irrationals-are-not-f-sigma]], and the false statement it refutes is [[fs-q-is-g-delta]]; the refutation is carried out here.

- **Meagre and measure zero are not the same smallness.** $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is both, but the two notions diverge as soon as one leaves the countable case: [[cex-meager-set-of-full-measure]] writes $\mathbb{R}$ as a meager set together with a set of measure zero, and the set of measure zero there is residual. So being residual, which is what claim 2 gives for $X$, carries no information at all about size in measure.

## Statement refuted

**Refuted claim:** $\mathbb{Q}$ is a $G_\delta$ subset of $\mathbb{R}$
([[fs-q-is-g-delta]]); equivalently, by complementation
([[def-f-sigma-g-delta]]), the irrationals are $F_\sigma$.

The witness is the set $X := \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ of
irrationals ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]). It **is** $G_\delta$, being
$\bigcap_n (\mathbb{R} \setminus \{e(n)\})$ for any enumeration $e$ of the
rationals, and it **is** residual, its complement being a countable union of
singletons; but it is **not** $F_\sigma$, and that is the failure of the refuted
claim. The refutation is carried out in full in
[[cor-q-is-meager-and-not-g-delta]]; this item records the witness and the three
properties that make it the right one.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The set $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ of rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$ and its complement $X = \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$.

[A1] The refuted claim: $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is $G_\delta$, equivalently $X$ is $F_\sigma$.

[L1] $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is $F_\sigma$ and meager, $X$ is $G_\delta$ and residual, and $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is not $G_\delta$ ([[cor-q-is-meager-and-not-g-delta]], claims 1, 2, 3).

[L2] $A$ is $F_\sigma$ if and only if $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ is $G_\delta$ ([[def-f-sigma-g-delta]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $X$ is $G_\delta$ and residual, by claim 2 of [L1]. [L1]

1.2 $X$ is not $F_\sigma$: were it $F_\sigma$, its complement $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ would be $G_\delta$ by [L2], which claim 3 of [L1] forbids. [L1, L2]

2.1 So $X$ is a residual $G_\delta$ set that is not $F_\sigma$, and it witnesses the failure of [A1] in both of the equivalent formulations. [step 1.1, step 1.2, A1, L2] ∎

## Remarks

- **The asymmetry is real and is not a defect of the definitions.** The two classes $F_\sigma$ and $G_\delta$ are exchanged by complementation, but a *particular* set need not lie in both: $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is $F_\sigma$ and not $G_\delta$, and $X$ is $G_\delta$ and not $F_\sigma$. A set lying in both classes is a genuinely stronger condition, satisfied for instance by every open set and every closed set.

- **What forces it is the Baire category theorem**, through the fact that $\mathbb{R}$ is not meager ([[thm-baire-category-r]]) while $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is. Both are dense; the rationals are countable and the irrationals are uncountable. No cardinality or density argument distinguishes them in the required way; the distinction is one of category.

- **$X$ is large in both senses.** It is residual, so it is large in category; and it is not null. For if it were, then, $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ being null ([[lem-countable-sets-are-null]]), one could interleave a cover of each with slack $\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$ and obtain a cover of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \cup X = \mathbb{R}$ of total length at most $\varepsilon$, which [[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]] forbids already for $[0,1]$. Interleaving two covers needs no choice principle, unlike the countably infinite case ([[thm-countable-union-of-null-is-null]]).

## Statement refuted

**Refuted claim:** meagreness and measure zero are comparable notions of
smallness, so that a set small in one sense is small, or at least not
co-small, in the other.

The witness is a decomposition $\mathbb{R} = (\mathbb{R} \setminus G) \cup G$ in
which $\mathbb{R} \setminus G$ is meager ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]]) and $G$
has measure zero ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]). So $\mathbb{R}$, which
by [[thm-baire-category-r]] is not meager, splits into two pieces each of which
is negligible, one in the sense of category and one in the sense of measure. In
particular $G$ is residual and null at the same time, and its complement is
meager and, being the complement of a null set, in no sense small in measure.

The set is
$$G := \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} U_n, \qquad U_n := \bigcup_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \big(e(k) - 2^{-k-n-2},\ e(k) + 2^{-k-n-2}\big),$$
where $e : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is a bijection onto the
rationals ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A bijection $e : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ onto the rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$, the sets $U_n$ and $G$ displayed above.

[A1] The refuted claim: a meager set and a set of measure zero cannot together exhaust $\mathbb{R}$, meagreness and nullity being comparable notions of smallness.

[L1] $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ and $q \mapsto \hat q$ is injective onto $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, so a bijection $e$ exists; $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-rationals-countable]], [[def-equinumerous]], [[def-countable]], [[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]], [[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L2] $(c,d)$ is an open interval of length $d - c$ and is an open set; an arbitrary union of open sets is open; the complement of an open set is closed ([[def-interval]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]).

[L3] A set is dense exactly when every $N_\varepsilon(x)$ meets it; a closed set is nowhere dense exactly when its interior is empty; a meager set is a union of a sequence of nowhere dense sets ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-nowhere-dense-meager]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]).

[L4] $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}2^{-k} = 2$, powers satisfy $2^{-k-n-1} = 2^{-n-1}2^{-k}$, finite sums scale, and $2^{-n} \to 0$ ([[thm-geometric-series]], [[def-series]], [[def-integer-power]], [[lem-power-laws]], [[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]], [[lem-geometric-sequence-null]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L5] Nullity: $A$ is null when for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a sequence of closed intervals covering $A$ with all partial total lengths at most $\varepsilon$; every at most countable set is null ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]], [[lem-countable-sets-are-null]]).

[L6] $\mathbb{R}$ is not a union of a sequence of nowhere dense sets ([[thm-baire-category-r]]).

[L7] $G$ is an intersection of a sequence of open sets, so it is $G_\delta$ ([[def-f-sigma-g-delta]]).

[L8] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 > 0$ and $2^{-k-n-2} > 0$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve an inequality ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Fix $e$ by [L1]. Each $U_n$ is an open set, being a union of open intervals by [L2], and each contains $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, since $e(k)$ lies in the $k$-th interval by [L8]. Hence each $U_n$ is dense by [L1] and [L3], a superset of a dense set being dense. [given, L1, L2, L3, L8, choose]

2.1 **$G$ is null.** Let the real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given and use [L4] to fix $n$ with $2^{-n} \le \varepsilon$. The closed intervals $I_k := [\,e(k) - 2^{-k-n-2},\ e(k) + 2^{-k-n-2}\,]$ cover $U_n$, hence cover $G \subseteq U_n$, and each has length $2^{-k-n-1} = 2^{-n-1}2^{-k}$ by [L2], [L4] and [L8]; so every partial total length is $\sum_{k<i}2^{-n-1}2^{-k} = 2^{-n-1}\sum_{k<i}2^{-k} \le 2^{-n-1} \cdot 2 = 2^{-n} \le \varepsilon$ by [L4]. By [L5] the set $G$ has measure zero. [step 1.1, L4, L5, L8]

2.2 **$\mathbb{R} \setminus G$ is meager.** By De Morgan $\mathbb{R} \setminus G = \bigcup_n (\mathbb{R} \setminus U_n)$, and each $\mathbb{R} \setminus U_n$ is closed by [L2]. Its interior is empty: if $N_\delta(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus U_n$ for some real $\delta > 0$, then $N_\delta(x)$ would miss $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \subseteq U_n$, contradicting the density of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ given by [L1] and [L3]. So each $\mathbb{R} \setminus U_n$ is nowhere dense by [L3], and $\mathbb{R} \setminus G$ is meager. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L3]

3.1 So $\mathbb{R} = (\mathbb{R} \setminus G) \cup G$ with the first piece meager and the second null, which is the failure of [A1]. Moreover $G$ is residual, its complement being meager, and $G \ne \varnothing$: were $G$ empty, $\mathbb{R} = \mathbb{R} \setminus G$ would be meager, contradicting [L6]. Thus $G$ is a residual, $G_\delta$ set of measure zero by [L7], and $\mathbb{R} \setminus G$ is a meager set whose complement is null. [step 2.1, step 2.2, A1, L3, L6, L7] ∎

## Remarks

- **Both pieces are as small as their notion allows, and they are complementary.**
  $G$ is null and residual; $\mathbb{R} \setminus G$ is meager and its complement
  is null. So no implication holds between "meager" and "null" in either
  direction, and neither can be strengthened to a statement about the complement.
  This is the standard duality between measure and category, and $G$ is the
  standard witness for it.

- **$G$ contains all the irrationals that are well approximable by rationals.**
  Membership in $U_n$ says that some rational $e(k)$ lies within
  $2^{-k-n-2}$ of the point, so $G$ is a set of points approximable by rationals
  at every accuracy of that shape. Nothing on this page needs that reading; it is
  recorded because it is what makes the example natural rather than contrived.

- **Baire is used only once, and only for nonemptiness.** Steps 2.1 and 2.2 are
  independent of [[thm-baire-category-r]]; it enters in step 3.1 to rule out
  $G = \varnothing$, which would make the decomposition vacuous. That is also the
  precise sense in which the example needs the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The individual $U_n$ are open, dense and of small total cover length**, which
  is [[ex-q-covered-by-intervals-of-small-total-length]] with
  $\varepsilon = 2^{-n}$; the example is that construction iterated and
  intersected.

## Statement

Let $\mathbb{R}$ be a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and
let $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$ be the canonical embedding
([[lem-of-q-embeds]]); write $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} = \iota[\mathbb{Q}]$ for the
copy of the rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$, the set usually written $\mathbb{Q}$
once the identification is made. Then the set of **irrationals**

$$\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$$

is uncountable ([[def-countable]]).

**Only the union of two sets is used, and that needs no choice whatsoever.** If
the irrationals were at most countable, then $\mathbb{R}$ would be the union of
the two at most countable sets $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and
$\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, and countability of a two-set
union is proved by interleaving two given enumerations. The countable union
theorem, which does spend $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$, is **not** invoked here and is
not needed; see the remarks below.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $\mathbb{R}$, the canonical embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$, the subset $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} = \iota[\mathbb{Q}]$ and its complement $X = \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, so that $\mathbb{R} = \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \cup X$.

[L1] $\iota$ is injective ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), hence a bijection of $\mathbb{Q}$ onto $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$; $\approx$ is transitive ([[def-equinumerous]], [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L2] $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$, so $\mathbb{Q}$ is at most countable ([[thm-rationals-countable]]).

[L3] A nonempty set is at most countable if and only if some surjection $\mathbb{N} \to$ it exists ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]]); uncountable means not at most countable ([[def-countable]]).

[L4] There is a bijection $\beta : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-n-cross-n-countable]]).

[L5] $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable ([[thm-r-uncountable]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $X = \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is at most countable. [assume-contra]

1.2 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \approx \mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ by [L1] and [L2], so $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is at most countable, and it is nonempty since $\iota(0) \in \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$. [L1, L2]

1.3 Fix the bijection $\beta : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ of [L4]. [L4]

2.1 If $X = \varnothing$ then $\mathbb{R} = \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, which is at most countable by step 1.2. [step 1.2, given]

2.2 Otherwise $X \ne \varnothing$, and since $X$ is at most countable by assumption and $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is nonempty and at most countable by step 1.2, [L3] provides surjections $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and $g : \mathbb{N} \to X$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L3]

3.1 Define $u : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ by $u(0,k) = f(k)$ and $u(n,k) = g(k)$ for $n \ne 0$. Every element of $\mathbb{R}$ lies in $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ or in $X$, hence is $f(k)$ or $g(k)$ for some $k$, so $u$ is surjective onto $\mathbb{R}$. The two surjections were obtained one after the other, not selected simultaneously from an infinite family, so no choice principle is used. [step 2.2, given]

4.1 Hence $u \circ \beta : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a surjection and $\mathbb{R} \ne \varnothing$, so $\mathbb{R}$ is at most countable by [L3]. [step 1.3, step 3.1, L3]

5.1 In either case $\mathbb{R}$ is at most countable, by step 2.1 in the first and step 4.1 in the second; this contradicts [L5]. Therefore $X = \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is uncountable. [step 2.1, step 4.1, L3, L5, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- The same argument shows that removing any at most countable set from $\mathbb{R}$ leaves an uncountable set. In particular the algebraic numbers, once they are available, can be removed to show transcendental numbers exist, which is how Cantor's 1874 paper presented the result: an existence proof for transcendentals with no example constructed.

- The corollary is a statement about the *set* of irrationals only. It says nothing about any individual irrational, and it does not exhibit one; the library exhibits $\sqrt{2}$ separately ([[ex-sqrt-two-exists]], [[fs-sqrt2-rational]]).

- Keeping the two-set union separate from the countable union is not pedantry. The countable case genuinely needs $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ ([[thm-countable-union-of-countable]]) and is unprovable in ZF conditionally on the consistency of ZF, which is the honest form of [[fs-countable-union-theorem-of-zf]] and rests on an external independence result quoted there rather than proved; whereas this corollary, like [[thm-r-uncountable]] itself, is outright a theorem of ZF.

## Definition

Recall that a natural number is a von Neumann natural
([[def-natural-numbers]]): $0 = \varnothing$ and $\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$, so
that

$$n = \{\, m \in \mathbb{N} : m < n \,\} = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$$

is itself the set of its predecessors. Here $<$ is the order of
[[def-nat-order]], which is defined additively, so the displayed identity is a
theorem and not a convention: it is [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]], proved
immediately above. Let $A$ be a set, and let $\approx$ be equinumerosity
([[def-equinumerous]]).

- $A$ is **finite** if $A \approx n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
- $A$ is **countably infinite** if $A \approx \mathbb{N}$.
- $A$ is **at most countable** if it is finite or countably infinite.
- $A$ is **uncountable** if it is not at most countable.

## Remarks

- **Convention: in this library "countable" alone always means "at most
  countable"**, so a finite set is countable. This is the convention of Halmos
  and of Tao, and it is the one that makes the theorems on this page read
  cleanly: subsets, products and unions of countable sets are countable, with no
  finite/infinite case split in the statement. The competing convention, used by
  Rudin among others, reserves "countable" for "countably infinite" and says
  "at most countable" for the disjunction. Under that convention every statement
  below still holds after replacing "countable" with "at most countable", but
  several would become false as literally written. Where the distinction
  matters, the long forms "countably infinite" and "at most countable" are used
  in full, and "uncountable" always means "not at most countable", on which the
  two conventions agree.

- **The three classes are exhaustive by construction**: every set is finite,
  countably infinite, or uncountable, since "uncountable" is defined as the
  negation of the disjunction. That they are also mutually exclusive, that is,
  that no set is both finite and countably infinite, is a genuine theorem
  amounting to $\mathbb{N} \not\approx n$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and it is
  proved immediately above as claim 4 of [[lem-pigeonhole]]. So a countably
  infinite set is never finite, and "$A$ is infinite", meaning not finite, is
  implied by $A \approx \mathbb{N}$. The same lemma pins down finiteness itself:
  by its claim 3 a finite set is equinumerous with exactly one natural number, so
  the number of elements of a finite set is well defined, and by its claim 5 no
  finite set is equinumerous with a proper subset of itself.

- **What the exclusivity is and is not used for below.** Nothing on this page
  needs it in order to run: the infinitude of $\mathbb{Q}$, for instance, is
  obtained by exhibiting a bijection $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ directly
  ([[thm-rationals-countable]]) rather than by ruling out finiteness. It is used
  where the two notions of infinity are compared
  ([[fs-infinite-has-countable-subset-in-zf]]) and where the continuum hypothesis
  is instantiated at $\mathbb{N}$ ([[rem-continuum-hypothesis]]), both of which
  need $\mathbb{N}$ to be infinite as a fact rather than as a convention.

- **$0$ and the empty set.** $0 = \varnothing$, and $A \approx 0$ holds exactly
  when $A = \varnothing$, so the empty set is finite. This matters in the proofs
  below, where the empty case is always separated out: a surjection
  $\mathbb{N} \to A$ cannot exist when $A = \varnothing$, which is why
  [[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]] assumes $A$ nonempty.

- **Countability is a property of a set alone**, not of a set with structure. In
  particular $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable while carrying a dense order, and
  $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable; neither statement says anything on its own about
  the order or the arithmetic those sets carry.

## Definition

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]] for the
terminology).

- $A$ and $B$ are **equinumerous**, written $A \approx B$, if there exists a
  bijection $f : A \to B$.
- $A$ is **dominated by** $B$, written $A \preceq B$, if there exists an
  injection $f : A \to B$.
- $A \prec B$ abbreviates: $A \preceq B$ and not $A \approx B$.

## Remarks

- **$\approx$ behaves like an equivalence relation.** It is reflexive
  ($\mathrm{id}_A$ is a bijection), symmetric (the inverse of a bijection is a
  bijection) and transitive (a composition of bijections is a bijection). The
  careful statement is that these three properties hold for all sets, and that
  $\approx$ restricted to any *set* of sets is an equivalence relation on that
  set. It is not a relation on "the set of all sets", which does not exist; the
  reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity statements are schemas about arbitrary
  sets, which is all any argument below uses.

- **$\preceq$ is reflexive and transitive**, for the same reasons, and
  $A \approx B$ implies both $A \preceq B$ and $B \preceq A$. The converse, that
  $A \preceq B$ and $B \preceq A$ together give $A \approx B$, is a theorem and
  not a triviality: it is [[thm-schroder-bernstein]], and it is proved without
  any use of choice.

- **Subsets.** $A \subseteq B$ implies $A \preceq B$, since the inclusion map is
  injective. The reverse fails badly for infinite sets: the successor map
  $\sigma$ is a bijection $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, being
  injective and never zero ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]) and hitting every
  nonzero natural ([[lem-nat-nonzero-is-successor]]), so
  $\mathbb{N} \approx \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$ and a proper subset can be
  equinumerous with the whole.

- $\approx$ is the library's substitute for "has the same number of elements",
  stated without introducing cardinal numbers. Everything on this page is phrased
  with $\approx$, $\preceq$ and $\prec$ alone, so no theory of cardinals is
  presupposed.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with open and closed sets as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

- $A$ is an **$F_\sigma$ set** when there is a sequence $(F_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$
  of closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ with
  $$A \;=\; \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} F_n .$$
- $A$ is a **$G_\delta$ set** when there is a sequence $(V_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$
  of open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ with
  $$A \;=\; \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} V_n .$$

The letters are the traditional ones: $F$ for *fermé* with $\sigma$ for *somme*,
$G$ for *Gebiet* with $\delta$ for *Durchschnitt*.

**The two classes are exchanged by complementation.** $A$ is $F_\sigma$ if and
only if $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ is $G_\delta$. If $A = \bigcup_n F_n$ with each
$F_n$ closed, then $\mathbb{R} \setminus A = \bigcap_n (\mathbb{R} \setminus F_n)$
by De Morgan, and each $\mathbb{R} \setminus F_n$ is open by the definition of
closedness ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]); the converse is the same computation
read backwards, using that the complement of an open set is closed, which is
again [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

**Every closed set is $F_\sigma$ and every open set is $G_\delta$**, by the
constant sequence $F_n := A$, respectively $V_n := A$. As with
[[def-nowhere-dense-meager]], an at most countable family ([[def-countable]]) may
always be presented as a sequence: a finite list $F_0, \dots, F_m$ of closed sets
is extended by $F_n := F_m$ for $n > m$, and a finite list of open sets likewise,
so nothing is lost by indexing over $\mathbb{N}$.

## Remarks

- **The classes are genuinely larger than the closed and the open sets.**
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is $F_\sigma$ and is neither open nor closed, and the irrationals
  are $G_\delta$ and neither open nor closed; both computations are in
  [[cor-q-is-meager-and-not-g-delta]]. That $\mathbb{Q}$ is not also $G_\delta$
  is the first genuinely hard fact about these classes and needs the Baire
  category theorem ([[thm-baire-category-r]]).

- **Why the algebra of open sets is not enough.** [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]
  gives that a *finite* intersection of open sets is open and a *finite* union of
  closed sets is closed. The definitions above are exactly what one gets by
  relaxing "finite" to "countable" once, and the point of the whole notion is
  that the relaxation is proper: a countable intersection of open sets need not
  be open, which is [[cex-intersection-of-shrinking-intervals-not-open]].

- **Nothing here is a measure-theoretic notion.** $F_\sigma$ and $G_\delta$ are
  defined from the topology of $\mathbb{R}$ alone and are used on this page to
  say precisely how far $\mathbb{Q}$ and its complement sit from being closed or
  open. They cut across [[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]] completely:
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is $F_\sigma$ and has measure zero
  ([[lem-countable-sets-are-null]]), while the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set is
  closed, hence $F_\sigma$, and does not
  ([[thm-fat-cantor-set-has-positive-measure]]).

## Definition

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets and let $f : A \to B$ be a function ([[def-function]]).

- $f$ is **injective** (one-to-one) if $f(x) = f(y)$ implies $x = y$, for all
  $x, y \in A$.
- $f$ is **surjective** (onto) if for every $b \in B$ there is some $x \in A$
  with $f(x) = b$; equivalently, the image $f[A] := \{ f(x) : x \in A \}$ equals
  $B$.
- $f$ is **bijective** if it is both injective and surjective.

For $S \subseteq A$ we write $f[S] = \{ f(x) : x \in S \}$ for the image of $S$,
and for $T \subseteq B$ we write $f^{-1}[T] = \{ x \in A : f(x) \in T \}$ for the
preimage of $T$; these are the image and preimage of a set under $f$ read as a
relation ([[def-image-and-preimage-under-a-relation]]).

## Remarks

- **Composition.** If $f : A \to B$ and $g : B \to C$ are both injective then so
  is $g \circ f$, since $g(f(x)) = g(f(y))$ forces $f(x) = f(y)$ and then
  $x = y$; if both are surjective then so is $g \circ f$, since any $c \in C$ is
  $g(b)$ for some $b \in B$ and that $b$ is $f(a)$ for some $a \in A$. Hence a
  composition of bijections is a bijection. These verifications, together with the
  two partial converses, are
  [[prop-composition-preserves-injectivity-surjectivity-and-bijectivity]].

- **Inverses.** $f : A \to B$ is bijective exactly when there is a function
  $f^{-1} : B \to A$ with $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ for all $x \in A$ and
  $f(f^{-1}(b)) = b$ for all $b \in B$; that two-sided inverse is unique, and it
  is itself a bijection. Injectivity alone gives a bijection from $A$ onto the
  image $f[A]$, and hence an inverse defined on $f[A]$ only. No choice principle
  is involved: the value $f^{-1}(b)$ is the *unique* $x$ with $f(x) = b$, so it
  is determined rather than selected. The full statement, with the uniqueness of the
  two-sided inverse, is
  [[thm-a-function-is-a-bijection-exactly-when-it-has-a-two-sided-inverse]]; the
  corresponding statement for an arbitrary surjection is not available at this point
  in the reading order, because a right inverse for every surjection is equivalent
  to the Axiom of Choice.

- **What this item does and does not do.** A function $A \to B$ is a set of ordered
  pairs, single valued and total on $A$ ([[def-function]]); ordered pairs, Cartesian
  products, images and preimages are fixed by [[def-ordered-pair]],
  [[def-cartesian-product]] and [[def-image-and-preimage-under-a-relation]]. This
  item only fixes the three adjectives and the notation used for them. Nothing here
  is proved.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with open and closed sets as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

- The **interior** of $A$ is the union of all open subsets of $A$:
  $$A^{\circ} \;:=\; \bigcup \{\, U \subseteq \mathbb{R} : U \text{ open and } U \subseteq A \,\}.$$
- The **closure** of $A$ is the intersection of all closed supersets of $A$:
  $$\overline{A} \;:=\; \bigcap \{\, F \subseteq \mathbb{R} : F \text{ closed and } A \subseteq F \,\}.$$
- The **boundary** of $A$ is $\partial A := \overline{A} \setminus A^{\circ}$.
- The **exterior** of $A$ is $\operatorname{ext} A := (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)^{\circ}$.

**Both operators are well defined and deliver what their names claim.** The
family whose union defines $A^{\circ}$ always contains $\varnothing$, and the
family whose intersection defines $\overline{A}$ always contains $\mathbb{R}$,
so the second family is nonempty and both expressions denote subsets of
$\mathbb{R}$ without appeal to any convention about empty unions or
intersections. Moreover:

- $A^{\circ}$ is **open**, being a union of open sets
  ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], claim 1), and $A^{\circ} \subseteq A$, since
  every set in the family is a subset of $A$. It is therefore the **largest**
  open subset of $A$: any open $U \subseteq A$ is a member of the family and so
  $U \subseteq A^{\circ}$.
- $\overline{A}$ is **closed**, being an intersection of a nonempty family of
  closed sets ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], claim 3), and $A \subseteq
  \overline{A}$, since every set in the family contains $A$. It is therefore the
  **smallest** closed superset of $A$: any closed $F \supseteq A$ is a member of
  the family and so $\overline{A} \subseteq F$.

**Pointwise description of the interior.** For $x \in \mathbb{R}$,

$$x \in A^{\circ} \iff \text{there is } \varepsilon > 0 \text{ with } N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A .$$

If $x \in A^{\circ}$ then, $A^{\circ}$ being open and containing $x$, there is
$\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A^{\circ} \subseteq A$.
Conversely if $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A$ then $N_\varepsilon(x)$ is an open
subset of $A$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) containing $x$, hence
$x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A^{\circ}$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

The corresponding pointwise description of the closure is not a definitional
matter and is proved separately, as [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

## Remarks

- **The four sets partition nothing by themselves, but three of them do.** For
  every $A$ the three sets $A^{\circ}$, $\partial A$ and $\operatorname{ext} A$
  are pairwise disjoint with union $\mathbb{R}$. This is not proved here and is
  not used on this page; what is used is only the definitions above and the
  characterisations of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

- **Interior and closure are dual.** Complementation exchanges the two families
  above, since $U$ is open exactly when $\mathbb{R} \setminus U$ is closed, so
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus A^{\circ} = \overline{\mathbb{R} \setminus A}$ and
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A} = (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)^{\circ} =
  \operatorname{ext} A$. The second identity is the reason the exterior is
  usually described as "the complement of the closure".

- **$A$ is open exactly when $A = A^{\circ}$, and closed exactly when
  $A = \overline{A}$.** For the first: $A^{\circ} \subseteq A$ always, and
  $A \subseteq A^{\circ}$ holds exactly when $A$ is one of the open subsets of
  $A$, that is, exactly when $A$ is open. The closure half is the same argument
  read the other way, and it is recorded as a claim of
  [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] because the rest of that theorem needs it.

- **Boundary points may or may not belong to the set.** $\partial (0,1) =
  \partial [0,1] = \{0,1\}$, and the two boundary points lie outside the first
  set and inside the second; the boundary sees only the way the set meets its
  complement, not which side the edge is assigned to.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]] and closure as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]].

- $x$ is an **adherent point** of $A$ when $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne
  \varnothing$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$.
- $x$ is a **limit point** (or *accumulation point*) of $A$ when
  $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every real
  $\varepsilon > 0$: every punctured neighbourhood of $x$ meets $A$.
- $x$ is an **isolated point** of $A$ when $x \in A$ and there is a real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$.
- The **derived set** of $A$ is
  $$A' \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \text{ is a limit point of } A \,\}.$$
- $A$ is **dense in $\mathbb{R}$** when $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$.

**A limit point is an adherent point**, since $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq
N_\varepsilon(x)$; and an element of $A$ is an adherent point of $A$, since
$x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). So the adherent
points of $A$ are exactly the points of $A \cup A'$, a statement proved as part
of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

**Limit point and isolated point are exact opposites inside $A$.** For
$x \in A$: $x$ is an isolated point of $A$ exactly when it is not a limit point
of $A$. Indeed $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$ says precisely that
$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, because $x$ itself always lies in
$N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ when $x \in A$; so the existence of an $\varepsilon$
witnessing isolation is the negation of the condition defining a limit point.
A point of $A$ is therefore either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$, and
never both.

**A limit point need not belong to the set, and a point of the set need not be a
limit point.** Both possibilities occur, and the two examples that matter later
are $0$, which is a limit point of $\{\, 1/k : k \ge 1 \,\}$ without belonging
to it, and $0$ again, which belongs to $\{0\} \cup [1,2]$ as an isolated point.

## Remarks

- **Terminology: *limit point* here is about a set, never about a sequence.**
  This library reserves *subsequential limit* for the sequential notion
  ([[def-subsequential-limit]]), and the two are genuinely different: the
  constant sequence $x_k = 0$ has $0$ as a subsequential limit, while its set of
  values $\{0\}$ has no limit point at all. The distinction is the one
  [[def-subsequential-limit]] records under "Terminology", and it is respected
  throughout this page.

- **Density is defined through the closure, not through intervals.** Saying
  $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$ is equivalent to saying that every nonempty open
  subset of $\mathbb{R}$ meets $A$, and also to saying that every neighbourhood
  of every real meets $A$; the equivalences follow from
  [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] and are used in that form in
  [[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]].

- **The derived set need not be comparable with the set.** It can be strictly
  larger, as for $\mathbb{Q}$: every punctured neighbourhood of any real
  contains a rational, since density supplies one strictly between $x$ and
  $x + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]), so the derived set of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is all of $\mathbb{R}$. It can be strictly smaller, as for
  $\{0\}$, whose derived set is empty; and it can be neither, as for
  $\{0\} \cup (1,2)$, whose derived set is $[1,2]$, a set containing points
  outside the original and omitting the point $0$ of it. A closed set satisfying
  $A \subseteq A'$ is called perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]).

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]) and its absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]).

Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ with
$\varepsilon > 0$. The **$\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\},$$

and the **punctured $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \;=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}.$$

The two descriptions of $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ agree because $|y - x| = 0$ holds
exactly when $y = x$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**A neighbourhood is an open interval.** For every $x$ and every
$\varepsilon > 0$,

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;=\; (x - \varepsilon,\ x + \varepsilon),$$

the interval of [[def-interval]]. Indeed [[lem-of-abs-value]] gives, for
$\varepsilon > 0$, the equivalence $|y - x| < \varepsilon \iff -\varepsilon <
y - x < \varepsilon$, and adding $x$ throughout turns the right-hand side into
$x - \varepsilon < y < x + \varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**The centre lies in its own neighbourhoods.** $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, since
$|x - x| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**Punctured neighbourhoods are never empty.** The element
$y := x + \varepsilon/2$ satisfies $|y - x| = \varepsilon/2$, which is
$> 0$ and $< \varepsilon$, so $y \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$
([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

**Monotonicity in the radius.** If $0 < \delta \le \varepsilon$ then
$N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, because $|y - x| < \delta \le
\varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**Nesting at an interior point.** If $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and
$0 < \delta \le \varepsilon - |y - x|$, then

$$N_\delta(y) \;\subseteq\; N_\varepsilon(x).$$

Indeed for $z \in N_\delta(y)$ the triangle inequality
([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]) gives
$|z - x| = |(z - y) + (y - x)| \le |z - y| + |y - x| < \delta + |y - x| \le
\varepsilon$. Note that $\varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ precisely because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, so such a $\delta$ always exists.

## Remarks

- **The radius is a real number, not a rational.** Nothing on this page tests a
  condition against rational radii only. That convention belongs to
  [[def-real-limit]], where the quantifier is over rational $\varepsilon$ and
  the passage between the rational and the real form is the sanctioned remark of
  [[def-sequence]]. Here $\varepsilon$ ranges over the positive reals
  throughout, and every statement above is proved for an arbitrary positive
  real.

- **Why the punctured version is separated out.** A limit point of a set is a
  point every punctured neighbourhood of which meets the set
  ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and deleting the centre is exactly what stops a point
  of the set from qualifying automatically. The unpunctured condition defines
  the weaker notion of an adherent point, and the difference between the two is
  precisely an isolated point.

- **Nesting is the workhorse.** Almost every openness verification on this page
  has the shape "given $y$ in the set, shrink the radius by the distance
  already travelled", which is the nesting property above. It is recorded here
  once so that no later proof has to redo the triangle inequality in passing.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with interior $A^{\circ}$ and closure
$\overline{A}$ as in [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]].

- $A$ is **nowhere dense** when the interior of its closure is empty:
  $$\big(\overline{A}\big)^{\circ} \;=\; \varnothing .$$
- $A$ is **meager**, or **of the first category**, when there is a sequence
  $(A_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of nowhere dense subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ with
  $$A \;=\; \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n .$$
- $A$ is **of the second category** when it is not meager.
- $A$ is **residual** (also *comeager*) when $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ is meager.

**Why a sequence, and why that is the same as "an at most countable union".**
Sequences here are indexed by $\mathbb{N}$, which contains $0$. A finite family
$A_0, \dots, A_m$ of nowhere dense sets is turned into a sequence by setting
$A_n := \varnothing$ for $n > m$, and $\varnothing$ is nowhere dense because
$\overline{\varnothing} = \varnothing$ has empty interior; the empty family is
handled the same way and gives $A = \varnothing$. So "a union of an at most
countable family of nowhere dense sets" ([[def-countable]]) and the displayed
condition define the same class, and the sequence form is used below because it
carries an explicit index and needs no case split.

**Nowhere dense means exactly that the complement of the closure is dense.**
For $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$,

$$\big(\overline{A}\big)^{\circ} = \varnothing \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A} \text{ is dense in } \mathbb{R} .$$

Indeed, by the pointwise description of the interior
([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]), $(\overline{A})^{\circ} = \varnothing$
says that no $x \in \mathbb{R}$ admits a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with
$N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq \overline{A}$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), that is,
that every $N_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $\mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A}$. By
claim 1 of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] that says precisely that every
$x \in \mathbb{R}$ is adherent to $\mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A}$, that is,
$\overline{\mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A}} = \mathbb{R}$, which is density
([[def-limit-point-r]]).

**A closed set is nowhere dense exactly when its interior is empty**, since a
closed set equals its own closure (claim 4 of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]],
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]). This is the form in which nowhere density is
verified nearly every time below. (The phrase *almost everywhere* is avoided
throughout this pair: it is a measure-theoretic term, and the only measure notion
defined here is measure zero.)

**Both classes are closed downwards.** If $B \subseteq A$ then
$\overline{B} \subseteq \overline{A}$ and hence
$(\overline{B})^{\circ} \subseteq (\overline{A})^{\circ}$
([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]), so a subset of a nowhere dense set is
nowhere dense. If $B \subseteq A = \bigcup_n A_n$ with each $A_n$ nowhere dense,
then $B = \bigcup_n (A_n \cap B)$ and each $A_n \cap B$ is nowhere dense by the
previous sentence, so a subset of a meager set is meager.

**A union of two meager sets is meager.** Let $M = \bigcup_n A_n$ and
$M' = \bigcup_n B_n$ with all $A_n$ and all $B_n$ nowhere dense; fixing one
witnessing sequence for $M$ and one for $M'$ is two instantiations of an
existential statement, not a choice principle. Let
$J : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ be a bijection
([[thm-n-cross-n-countable]]) and define a sequence $(C_j)_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ by

$$C_{J(m,n)} \;:=\; \begin{cases} A_n & m = 0, \\ B_n & m \ne 0. \end{cases}$$

This is a total definition because $J$ is a bijection, every $C_j$ is nowhere
dense, and $\bigcup_j C_j = M \cup M'$, since $A_n = C_{J(0,n)}$ and
$B_n = C_{J(1,n)}$ and every $C_j$ is one of the $A_n$ or one of the $B_n$.

## Remarks

- **The countably infinite version of the last observation is a different
  statement.** To show that $\bigcup_i M_i$ is meager for a sequence $(M_i)$ of
  meager sets one must select a witnessing sequence of nowhere dense sets for
  every $i$ at once, which is an application of countable choice
  ([[def-countable-choice]]); the two-set case above avoids it because two
  selections are two instantiations. Nothing on this page uses the countably
  infinite version, and every meager set met below is presented together with an
  explicit witnessing sequence.

- **Nowhere dense is strictly stronger than having empty interior.**
  $\mathbb{Q}$ has empty interior, since no neighbourhood consists of rationals
  alone, yet $\overline{\mathbb{Q}} = \mathbb{R}$ has interior $\mathbb{R}$, so
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is not nowhere dense. It is nevertheless meager, being a union of
  singletons; that computation is [[cor-q-is-meager-and-not-g-delta]].

- **First category, second category and residual are not a trichotomy.** A set
  is meager or of the second category, and those two are exhaustive and
  exclusive by definition. Residual is a separate condition on the complement: a
  residual set is of the second category once $\mathbb{R}$ is known not to be
  meager in itself ([[thm-baire-category-r]]), but before that theorem nothing
  rules out a set that is both meager and residual.

- **Category is a notion of topological smallness, and it is independent of
  smallness in the sense of measure.** Neither of the two implications between
  "nowhere dense" and "measure zero" ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]])
  holds, and $\mathbb{R}$ itself splits into a meager set and a set of measure
  zero; the three items settling this are
  [[fs-nowhere-dense-implies-measure-zero]],
  [[fs-measure-zero-implies-nowhere-dense]] and
  [[cex-meager-set-of-full-measure]].

## Definition

Let $U, F \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]].

- $U$ is **open** when for every $x \in U$ there is a real $\varepsilon > 0$
  with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$.
- $F$ is **closed** when its complement $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open.
- A set is **clopen** when it is both open and closed.

The whole of the topology of $\mathbb{R}$ developed on this page rests on this
one definition: closedness is *defined* as openness of the complement, and every
other description of a closed set on this page is a theorem
([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]]).

**$\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen.** The condition defining openness
quantifies over the elements of the set, so it holds vacuously for
$\varnothing$; and for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ one has $N_1(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$,
so $\mathbb{R}$ is open. Since each of the two is the complement of the other,
each is also closed.

**Every neighbourhood is open.** Let $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and put
$\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x|$, which is $> 0$ because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$. The nesting property of [[def-neighbourhood-r]] gives
$N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$. So every point of $N_\varepsilon(x)$
has a neighbourhood inside it.

**The four open forms of [[def-interval]] are open sets.** Let $a, b \in
\mathbb{R}$.

- $(a,b)$: for $x$ with $a < x < b$, both $x - a > 0$ and $b - x > 0$, so
  $\delta := \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ is a positive real (the minimum of a
  two-element set of reals exists, [[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).
  If $|y - x| < \delta$ then $y > x - \delta \ge x - (x - a) = a$ and
  $y < x + \delta \le x + (b - x) = b$, so $y \in (a,b)$; hence
  $N_\delta(x) \subseteq (a,b)$.
- $(a,\infty)$: for $x > a$ take $\delta := x - a > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y > x - \delta = a$.
- $(-\infty,b)$: for $x < b$ take $\delta := b - x > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y < x + \delta = b$.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: already treated above.

**The four closed forms of [[def-interval]] are closed sets.** In each case the
complement is shown open directly.

- $[a,b]$: if $x \notin [a,b]$ then $x < a$ or $x > b$ by trichotomy
  ([[def-ordered-field]]). If $x < a$, take $\delta := a - x > 0$; every
  $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has $y < x + \delta = a$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. If
  $x > b$, take $\delta := x - b > 0$; every $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has
  $y > x - \delta = b$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. So
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus [a,b]$ is open.
- $[a,\infty)$: its complement is $(-\infty,a)$, which is open by the previous
  paragraph.
- $(-\infty,b]$: its complement is $(b,\infty)$, which is open.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: its complement is $\varnothing$, which is
  open.

## Remarks

- **Open and closed are not opposites, and not exhaustive.** A set may be
  neither: the half-open interval $[0,1)$ is neither open nor closed
  ([[fs-every-set-is-open-or-closed]]). A set may be both: $\varnothing$ and
  $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen. The words are inherited from the interval terminology
  of [[def-interval]], and the agreement between the two usages is exactly the
  two lists verified above: an interval called open there is an open set here,
  and an interval called closed there is a closed set here.

- **A clopen set is a disconnection waiting to happen.** If $A$ is clopen and
  both $A$ and $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ are nonempty, then each of the two is
  its own closure, so the two are separated in the sense of
  [[def-connected-r]] and $\mathbb{R} = A \cup (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)$ is a
  disconnection. Since $\mathbb{R}$ is order-convex it is connected
  ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]]), so no such $A$ exists:
  $\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are the only clopen subsets of $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The half-open forms are the ones the two lists omit**, and deliberately so:
  $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ with $a < b$ are neither open nor closed as subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The radius depends on the point.** Openness asks for *some* $\varepsilon$
  at each point, and that $\varepsilon$ may shrink to nothing as the point
  approaches the edge of the set, as the computation for $(a,b)$ shows: there
  $\delta = \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ tends to $0$ as $x$ tends to either endpoint.
  Asking instead for a single $\varepsilon$ that works simultaneously at every
  point of the set is a strictly stronger condition, and it is not what is
  defined here; nothing on this page uses it.

## Statement

**False claim:** $\mathbb{Q}$, that is the set $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ of
rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), is a $G_\delta$ set
([[def-f-sigma-g-delta]]): there is a sequence $(V_n)$ of open subsets of
$\mathbb{R}$ with $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} = \bigcap_n V_n$.

The claim looks plausible by symmetry. $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is $F_\sigma$,
being a countable union of singletons; the irrationals are $G_\delta$, being a
countable intersection of complements of singletons; and the two classes are
exchanged by complementation. So one expects each set to belong to both classes.
It does not: the symmetry between the two *classes* says nothing about a single
set, and the obstruction is the Baire category theorem.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The set $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ of rationals.

[A1] The false claim: $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is a $G_\delta$ subset of $\mathbb{R}$.

[L1] $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is $F_\sigma$ and meager, the irrationals are $G_\delta$ and residual, and $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is **not** $G_\delta$ ([[cor-q-is-meager-and-not-g-delta]], claims 1, 2 and 3).

[L2] $A$ is $G_\delta$ when it is the intersection of a sequence of open sets ([[def-f-sigma-g-delta]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L3] A countable intersection of dense open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ is dense; in particular it is nonempty ([[thm-baire-category-r]]).

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By claim 3 of [L1], $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is not a $G_\delta$ subset of $\mathbb{R}$, which is the direct negation of [A1]. [A1, L1, L2]

1.2 The reason, recorded here so that the refutation is not merely a pointer: were $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} = \bigcap_n V_n$ with each $V_n$ open, every $V_n$ would contain the dense set $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and so be dense; adjoining the dense open sets $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{q\}$, one for each rational $q$, would produce an at most countable family of dense open sets whose intersection is $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ minus every rational, that is $\varnothing$, contradicting [L3]. [L1, L2, L3]

2.1 So [A1] is false, and the refutation is carried out in full in [L1]. [step 1.1, step 1.2, A1] ∎

## Remarks

- **What is true about $\mathbb{Q}$.** It is $F_\sigma$, meager, of measure zero,
  dense, and countable. What fails is only the $G_\delta$ property, and its
  failure is a genuine theorem about $\mathbb{R}$, resting on completeness through
  [[thm-nested-interval-property]] inside [[thm-baire-category-r]]. Inside
  $\mathbb{Q}$ itself the corresponding claim is true and trivial, $\mathbb{Q}$
  being the whole space there.

- **The dual false statement is not recorded separately**, because it is the same
  statement: the irrationals fail to be $F_\sigma$ exactly because
  $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ fails to be $G_\delta$
  ([[def-f-sigma-g-delta]]). The witness is
  [[cex-irrationals-are-not-f-sigma]].

- **Context, not a result of this library.** In classical analysis the set of
  points at which a real function is continuous is always $G_\delta$, and it is
  the false statement above that then rules out a function continuous at every
  rational and at no irrational. That classical result is not proved here, and
  continuity is not available at this point in the reading order; the connection
  is recorded as orientation and nothing on this page depends on it.

## Statement

Write $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the image of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$
under the canonical embedding $q \mapsto \hat q$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), the
set usually written $\mathbb{Q}$ once the identification is made, and put
$X := \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the irrationals. Then:

1. $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$, that is,
   $\overline{\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}} = \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]);
2. $X$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$;
3. every nonempty open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable
   ([[def-countable]]).

Claim 2 is not a symmetry of claim 1: the rationals are dense because they are
*constructed* to approximate, whereas the irrationals are dense because there are
too many points in any interval for a countable set to exhaust it, which is why
claim 3 is proved alongside and used for it.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The canonical embedding $q \mapsto \hat q$ of $\mathbb{Q}$ into $\mathbb{R}$, its image $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, and the complement $X = \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$.

[L1] $\overline{A}$ is the set of points every neighbourhood of which meets $A$; $A$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ when $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L2] $N_\varepsilon(x) = (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon)$ for real $\varepsilon > 0$, and $x - \varepsilon < x + \varepsilon$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L3] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L4] Strictly between any two reals lies an element of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, and $q \mapsto \hat q$ is injective ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L5] $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-rationals-countable]]); an injection is a bijection onto its image, and $\approx$ is symmetric and transitive ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]], [[def-equinumerous]]).

[L6] Every subset of an at most countable set is at most countable, and uncountable means not at most countable ([[lem-subset-of-countable]], [[def-countable]]).

[L7] For $a < b$ the interval $(a,b)$ is uncountable ([[cor-interval-uncountable]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is dense: let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real; by [L2] one has $x - \varepsilon < x + \varepsilon$, so [L4] supplies $\hat q$ with $x - \varepsilon < \hat q < x + \varepsilon$, that is $\hat q \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$. Every real is therefore an adherent point of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and claim 1 follows from [L1]. [L1, L2, L4]

1.2 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is at most countable: the embedding is an injection of $\mathbb{Q}$ with image $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, hence a bijection onto it, so $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \approx \mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$. [L4, L5]

1.3 For all reals $a < b$ the interval $(a,b)$ is uncountable. [L7]

2.1 For all reals $a < b$ the interval $(a,b)$ contains an irrational: if it did not, then $(a,b) \subseteq \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, so $(a,b)$ would be a subset of an at most countable set by step 1.2 and hence at most countable by [L6], contradicting step 1.3. So some $z \in (a,b)$ lies in $X$. [step 1.2, step 1.3, L6]

2.2 Every nonempty open $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is uncountable: fix $x \in U$ and, by [L3], a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; by [L2] the set $N_\varepsilon(x)$ is the interval $(x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon)$ with $x - \varepsilon < x + \varepsilon$, hence uncountable by step 1.3. Were $U$ at most countable, its subset $N_\varepsilon(x)$ would be at most countable by [L6], which it is not; so $U$ is uncountable, which is claim 3. [step 1.3, L2, L3, L6, choose]

3.1 $X$ is dense: let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real; applying step 2.1 with $a = x - \varepsilon$ and $b = x + \varepsilon$ gives $z \in (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon) \cap X$, which is $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap X$ by [L2]. Every real is therefore an adherent point of $X$, so $\overline{X} = \mathbb{R}$ by [L1], which is claim 2. [step 2.1, L1, L2]

4.1 Claims 1, 2 and 3 are steps 1.1, 3.1 and 2.2, so both $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and its complement are dense in $\mathbb{R}$ and every nonempty open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable. [step 1.1, step 2.2, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Two dense sets can be disjoint.** $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and $X$ partition
  $\mathbb{R}$ and both are dense, so density says nothing about size: one of
  them is countable and the other is not
  ([[cor-irrationals-uncountable]]). What density does say is that neither has
  interior: a set whose complement is dense has empty interior, which is the
  computation carried out for $\mathbb{Q}$ in
  [[ex-closure-interior-boundary-of-q]].

- **Claim 3 is a statement about open sets, not about intervals.** It follows
  from the uncountability of intervals ([[cor-interval-uncountable]]) only
  because openness supplies an interval inside the set at each of its points.
  A nonempty set with empty interior can perfectly well be countable, as
  $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ shows.

- **An explicit irrational is not produced here.** Step 2.1 is a counting
  argument and exhibits nothing. The library does exhibit one separately,
  $\sqrt 2$ ([[thm-of-square-roots]], [[fs-sqrt2-rational]]), and an explicit
  irrational in a given interval $(a,b)$ can be built from it as
  $q_1 + (q_2 - q_1)/\sqrt 2$ for suitable rationals $q_1 < q_2$ in the
  interval; that route is longer and is not the one taken above.

## Statement

The map $q \mapsto \hat q$ ([[def-real-numbers]]) is an embedding of ordered
fields. Every real is approximated by rationals: for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and
rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ with
$|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$. Consequently, strictly between any two
reals lies a rational.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real $x = [(a_n)]$ and a rational $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] The orders of $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}$; ordered-field arithmetic ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Field arithmetic in $\mathbb{Q}$: $\varepsilon/2, \delta/4$ are positive rationals, and every nonzero rational $q$ has a reciprocal $1/q$ with $q \cdot (1/q) = 1$ ([[thm-rat-field]]).

[L3] Cauchy definition ([[def-rational-cauchy-sequence]]).

[L4] Real positivity via eventual rational lower bounds ([[def-real-order]]).

[L5] $\mathbb{R} = \mathcal{C}/\mathcal{N}$ is a field ([[thm-reals-field]]), and $0_{\mathbb{R}} = \hat 0$, $1_{\mathbb{R}} = \hat 1$ are the classes of the constant sequences ([[def-real-numbers]]). A multiplicative inverse there is unique: if $ab = 1_{\mathbb{R}} = ac$ then $b = b(ac) = (ba)c = c$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Embedding: constant sequences are Cauchy; $\hat q = \hat r$ iff the constant $q - r$ is null iff $q = r$; operations match termwise; and $q < r$ gives the constant lower bound $r - q > 0$, so $\hat q < \hat r$ and order is preserved and reflected. [L1, L4]

1.2 Fix $N$ with $|a_m - a_n| < \varepsilon/2$ for all $m, n \ge N$, and set $q = a_N$. [L3, L2]

2.1 The difference $\hat q - x$ has representative $(a_N - a_n)$ with $|a_N - a_n| < \varepsilon/2$ for $n \ge N$; hence both $\hat\varepsilon - (x - \hat q)$ and $\hat\varepsilon - (\hat q - x)$ have representatives eventually $> \varepsilon/2$, so both are positive: $|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$. [step 1.2, L4, L1]

2.2 Inverses: let $q$ be a nonzero rational. Then $\hat q \ne \hat 0 = 0_{\mathbb{R}}$ by the injectivity of step 1.1, and $1/q$ exists in $\mathbb{Q}$ by [L2]; since the operations match termwise (step 1.1), $\hat q \cdot \widehat{1/q} = \widehat{q \cdot (1/q)} = \hat 1 = 1_{\mathbb{R}}$. Inverses in $\mathbb{R}$ are unique by [L5], so $(\hat q)^{-1} = \widehat{1/q}$: the embedding preserves reciprocals. [step 1.1, L2, L5]

3.1 Density: let $x < y$; pick $\delta > 0$ rational and $N$ with the representative of $y - x$ eventually $> \delta$; set $\varepsilon = \delta/4$ and pick $q$ with $|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$; then $q' = q + 2\varepsilon$ satisfies $\hat q' - x \ge -\hat\varepsilon + 2\hat\varepsilon = \hat\varepsilon > 0$ and $y - \hat q' \ge \hat\delta - \hat\varepsilon - 2\hat\varepsilon = \hat\delta/4 > 0$, so $x < \hat q' < y$. [step 2.1, L4, L1, L2]

4.1 The rationals embed as an ordered subfield — injectively, preserving the order in both directions, the ring operations, and reciprocals — and they approximate every real arbitrarily well and separate any two reals. [step 1.1, step 2.2, step 3.1] ∎

## Statement

Let $(U_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, each
open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) and dense ([[def-limit-point-r]]). Then

$$\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} U_n \quad \text{is dense in } \mathbb{R}.$$

Consequently, if $(A_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence of nowhere dense
subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]]), then
$\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n \ne \mathbb{R}$: no meager subset of
$\mathbb{R}$ exhausts $\mathbb{R}$, so $\mathbb{R}$ is of the second category in
itself.

**The selection is canonical, and the proof spends no choice principle.** The
textbook argument picks a nested interval at every stage in terms of the one
before it, which is the axiom of dependent choice ([[def-dependent-choice]]). The construction below
instead fixes one enumeration $e$ of the rationals ([[thm-rationals-countable]],
[[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) and, at every stage, takes the interval whose two
rational endpoints have **least index** among those meeting the requirements.
The requirements are met by some rational-endpoint interval, which is what the
refinement claim of the proof establishes, and the least such index is
determined by [[thm-well-ordering-principle]]; so the whole recursion is a
single application of [[thm-recursion]] to one total map. This is the device of
[[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]], transplanted from perfect sets to dense open
sets. What it does **not** settle is the strength of the theorem for general
complete metric spaces, which is recorded separately in
[[rem-baire-in-r-is-choice-free]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(U_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of dense open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$. Write $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the image of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ under $q \mapsto \hat q$. A pair $(p,q) \in \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \times \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is called **good** when $p < q$, and $G$ denotes the set of good pairs.

[A1] Each $U_n$ is open and dense in $\mathbb{R}$.

[L1] $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is dense when $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$, and $\overline{A}$ is exactly the set of points every neighbourhood of which meets $A$; so $A$ is dense if and only if $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and every real $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L2] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; $N_\varepsilon(x) = (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon)$; every open interval $(p,q)$ is an open set, and $[p,q]$ is a closed bounded interval, nonempty when $p \le q$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L3] The intersection of two open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ is open, and the complement of a closed set is open ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L4] $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-rationals-countable]], [[def-equinumerous]]); $q \mapsto \hat q$ is injective with image $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, and strictly between any two reals lies an element of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]); a composition of bijections is a bijection ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L5] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L6] Recursion: for a set $Y$, an element $y_0 \in Y$ and a function $T : Y \to Y$ there is $h : \mathbb{N} \to Y$ with $h(0) = y_0$ and $h(\sigma(k)) = T(h(k))$ ([[thm-recursion]]).

[L7] Nested interval property: for nonempty closed bounded intervals $I_k = [a_k,b_k]$ with $I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k$, the intersection $\bigcap_k I_k$ is nonempty ([[thm-nested-interval-property]]).

[L8] $A$ is nowhere dense exactly when $\mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A}$ is dense; $\overline{A}$ is a closed set containing $A$ ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]]).

[L9] An at most countable family may always be presented as a sequence indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ ([[def-countable]], [[def-nowhere-dense-meager]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 Fix $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ and a real $\varepsilon_0 > 0$; by [L1] it suffices to produce a point of $\bigcap_n U_n$ lying in $N_{\varepsilon_0}(x_0)$, since $x_0$ and $\varepsilon_0$ are then arbitrary. [given, L1, suffices: one point in each neighbourhood]

1.2 By [L4] fix a bijection $\beta : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$ and put $e := \iota \circ \beta$, where $\iota(q) = \hat q$, so that $e$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N}$ onto $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$. [L4, choose]

1.3 Recall the terminology of the Given: a pair $(p,q)$ of elements of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is good when $p < q$, and $G$ is the set of good pairs. [given, construct]

2.1 **Refinement claim.** For every good $(p,q)$ and every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there is a good $(p',q')$ with $[p',q'] \subseteq (p,q) \cap U_n$. To see it, note first that $(p,q)$ is nonempty, since [L4] supplies an element of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ strictly between $p$ and $q$, and that $(p,q)$ is open by [L2]; fix $y_1 \in (p,q)$ and, by [L2], a real $\rho_1 > 0$ with $N_{\rho_1}(y_1) \subseteq (p,q)$. Since $U_n$ is dense, [A1] and [L1] give $y \in N_{\rho_1}(y_1) \cap U_n$, so $y \in (p,q) \cap U_n$, and that set is open by [A1], [L2] and [L3], so there is a real $\rho > 0$ with $N_\rho(y) \subseteq (p,q) \cap U_n$. By [L4] fix $p', q' \in \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ with $y - \rho < p' < y < q' < y + \rho$. Then $p' < q'$, so $(p',q')$ is good, and every $t \in [p',q']$ satisfies $y - \rho < p' \le t \le q' < y + \rho$, whence $|t - y| < \rho$ and $t \in N_\rho(y)$; thus $[p',q'] \subseteq N_\rho(y) \subseteq (p,q) \cap U_n$. [step 1.3, A1, L1, L2, L3, L4, choose]

3.1 **Successor rule.** For $(k, (p,q)) \in \mathbb{N} \times G$ let $m$ be the least natural for which some natural $j$ makes $(e(m), e(j))$ good with $[e(m), e(j)] \subseteq (p,q) \cap U_k$, and let $j$ be the least natural with that property for that $m$; put $T(k,(p,q)) := (\sigma(k), (e(m), e(j)))$. The set of eligible $m$ is nonempty by step 2.1 applied with $n = k$, since $e$ is onto $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ by step 1.2, so both minima exist by [L5] and $T : \mathbb{N} \times G \to \mathbb{N} \times G$ is a total function defined without any selection. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L4, L5, construct]

4.1 **The recursion.** By [L4] fix $p_0, q_0 \in \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ with $x_0 - \varepsilon_0 < p_0 < x_0 < q_0 < x_0 + \varepsilon_0$; then $(p_0,q_0)$ is good and, as in step 2.1, $[p_0,q_0] \subseteq N_{\varepsilon_0}(x_0)$ by [L2]. Apply [L6] with $Y = \mathbb{N} \times G$, seed $(0,(p_0,q_0))$ and map $T$ to get $h : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times G$ with $h(0) = (0,(p_0,q_0))$ and $h(\sigma(k)) = T(h(k))$; an induction on $k$ shows that the first coordinate of $h(k)$ is $k$, so write $h(k) = (k,(p_k,q_k))$, every $(p_k,q_k)$ being good. [step 1.1, step 1.3, step 3.1, L2, L4, L6, construct]

5.1 Write $I_k := [p_k, q_k]$, a nonempty closed bounded interval by [L2]. The rule of step 3.1 gives, for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, that $I_{k+1} \subseteq (p_k,q_k) \cap U_k \subseteq I_k$; in particular the family $(I_k)$ is nested and $I_{k+1} \subseteq U_k$. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L2]

6.1 By [L7] applied to the nested family $(I_k)$ of nonempty closed bounded intervals, $\bigcap_{k} I_k \ne \varnothing$; fix $x$ in it. [step 5.1, L7, choose]

7.1 For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ one has $x \in I_{n+1} \subseteq U_n$ by steps 5.1 and 6.1, so $x \in \bigcap_n U_n$; and $x \in I_0 \subseteq N_{\varepsilon_0}(x_0)$ by steps 4.1 and 6.1. So $N_{\varepsilon_0}(x_0)$ meets $\bigcap_n U_n$. [step 4.1, step 5.1, step 6.1]

8.1 Since $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ and the real $\varepsilon_0 > 0$ were arbitrary, every neighbourhood of every point of $\mathbb{R}$ meets $\bigcap_n U_n$, so that set is dense by [L1]. [step 1.1, step 7.1, L1]

9.1 For the consequence, let $(A_n)$ be a sequence of nowhere dense sets and put $U_n := \mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A_n}$, which is open by [L3] and [L8] and dense by [L8]; by step 8.1 the set $\bigcap_n U_n$ is dense, hence nonempty, and any $x$ in it lies outside every $\overline{A_n}$ and so outside every $A_n$, giving $x \notin \bigcup_n A_n$ and therefore $\bigcup_n A_n \ne \mathbb{R}$. By [L9] the same conclusion covers a union of an at most countable family of nowhere dense sets, so no meager set is all of $\mathbb{R}$. [step 8.1, L1, L3, L8, L9, discharge-construct] ∎

## Remarks

- **What "dense" is doing at each end.** Density of the $U_n$ is used exactly once, in the refinement claim, to find a point of $U_n$ inside a given open interval; openness is used exactly once, immediately after, to fit a whole closed interval with rational endpoints around that point. Neither hypothesis can be dropped. Without openness the conclusion fails: the family consisting of $\mathbb{Q}$ together with all the sets $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{q\}$ for $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ is an at most countable family of dense sets, all but the first of them open, and its intersection is empty. Without density it fails too, for the constant sequence $U_n := (0,1)$ has intersection $(0,1)$, which is not dense in $\mathbb{R}$.

- **Only nonemptiness of the nested intersection is used.** The construction does not force the interval lengths to $0$ and does not need to: claim 1 of [[thm-nested-interval-property]] already produces a point, and one point is all the argument wants. That is why no Archimedean step appears anywhere above.

- **The consequence is the form used downstream.** Applying it to the sequence of singletons $\{x_n\}$ of a supposed enumeration of $\mathbb{R}$ reproves that $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable ([[ex-baire-reproves-r-uncountable]]); applying it to a supposed presentation of $\mathbb{Q}$ as a $G_\delta$ set is what shows that no such presentation exists ([[cor-q-is-meager-and-not-g-delta]]).

- **Category is not measure.** The intersection produced above is dense but may be very small in the sense of [[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]; indeed $\mathbb{R}$ decomposes as a meager set together with a set of measure zero ([[cex-meager-set-of-full-measure]]), so this theorem says nothing whatever about size in measure.

## Statement

Let $C$ be the Cantor set ([[def-cantor-set]]). Then:

1. $C$ is closed and bounded, hence compact
   ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]]);
2. $C$ has content zero, and therefore measure zero
   ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]);
3. $C$ is perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]);
4. $C$ is uncountable ([[def-countable]]);
5. $C$ contains no interval with two distinct endpoints, and is nowhere dense
   ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]]);
6. every nonempty connected subset of $C$ ([[def-connected-r]]) is a single
   point.

Claim 6 is what the phrase "totally disconnected" names elsewhere; that phrase
is **not** used here, because no definition of total disconnectedness exists at
this point in the reading order. What is proved is exactly the displayed
statement, and it is obtained from claim 5 through
[[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The sets $C_n$ and $C$ of [[def-cantor-set]], and the map $\Phi$ and the set $D$ of $\{0,2\}$-valued sequences of [[thm-cantor-set-ternary-description]].

[L1] $C_0 = [0,1]$, $C_{n+1} = \tfrac13 C_n \cup (\tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C_n)$, $C = \bigcap_n C_n \subseteq C_m$ for every $m$, every $C_n \subseteq [0,1]$, $0 \in C$, and $3^{-n} = (3^{-1})^n$ ([[def-cantor-set]], [[def-interval]], [[def-integer-power]], [[lem-power-laws]]).

[L2] $\Phi$ is a bijection from $D$ onto $C$, $\Phi(a) = \sum_{k \ge 0} a_k 3^{-k-1}$, and convergent series add and scale termwise ([[thm-cantor-set-ternary-description]], [[lem-series-linearity]], [[def-series]]).

[L3] $[c,d]$ is a closed set and a bounded interval, $(c,d)$ is open, $N_\varepsilon(x) = (x-\varepsilon, x+\varepsilon)$, and every open set contains a neighbourhood of each of its points ([[def-interval]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L4] Finite unions of closed sets are closed, and an intersection of a nonempty family of closed sets is closed ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]).

[L5] A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is compact exactly when it is closed and bounded ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L6] Content zero and measure zero as in [[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]; a set of content zero is null ([[lem-content-zero-implies-null]]); no null set contains an interval $[u,v]$ with $u < v$ ([[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]]).

[L7] $P$ is perfect when it is closed and no point of it is isolated in it ([[def-perfect-set-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]); every nonempty perfect subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable ([[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]], [[def-countable]]).

[L8] A set is nowhere dense exactly when the interior of its closure is empty, and a closed set equals its closure ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]]).

[L9] A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is connected exactly when it is order-convex ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]], [[def-connected-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L10] $|r|^k \to 0$ for $|r| < 1$ ([[lem-geometric-sequence-null]]); convergence to $0$ is tested against rational $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-real-limit]]); $|z| \ge 0$, $|z| = z$ for $z \ge 0$, and $|uv| = |u||v|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L11] Induction on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]); finite sums split, scale and are monotone in their terms ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L12] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 > 0$, $3 > 0$, $3^{-1} > 0$ and $0 < 2 \cdot 3^{-1} < 1$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve an inequality; the order is total and transitive ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **$C$ is compact, claim 1.** First, for $\lambda \ne 0$ and $c \in \mathbb{R}$ the set $\lambda S + c := \{\lambda s + c : s \in S\}$ is closed whenever $S$ is: if $x \notin \lambda S + c$ then $(x - c)\lambda^{-1} \notin S$, so by [L3] there is a real $\eta > 0$ with $N_\eta((x-c)\lambda^{-1}) \cap S = \varnothing$, and every $z$ with $|z - x| < |\lambda|\eta$ satisfies $|(z-c)\lambda^{-1} - (x-c)\lambda^{-1}| = |z-x| \cdot |\lambda|^{-1} < \eta$ by [L10] and [L12], hence $(z-c)\lambda^{-1} \notin S$ and $z \notin \lambda S + c$. Now every $C_n$ is closed, by induction on $n$ ([L11]): $C_0 = [0,1]$ is closed by [L3], and $C_{n+1}$ is the union of the two closed sets $\tfrac13 C_n$ and $\tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C_n$, hence closed by [L4]. So $C = \bigcap_n C_n$ is closed by [L4], and $C \subseteq [0,1]$ is bounded by [L1] and [L3]; by [L5] it is compact. [L1, L3, L4, L5, L10, L11, L12]

1.2 **$C$ has content zero and measure zero, claim 2.** By induction on $n$ ([L11]) the following holds for every $n$: there are $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and reals $u_0 \le v_0, \dots, u_m \le v_m$ with $C_n \subseteq \bigcup_{j \le m}[u_j,v_j]$ and $\sum_{j \le m}(v_j - u_j) = (2 \cdot 3^{-1})^{n}$. At $n = 0$ take the single interval $[0,1]$, of total length $1 = (2 \cdot 3^{-1})^0$ by [L1]. Given such a list at $n$, define $2m + 2$ intervals by $[u_j 3^{-1},\, v_j 3^{-1}]$ for $j \le m$ and $[2 \cdot 3^{-1} + u_{j-m-1}3^{-1},\, 2 \cdot 3^{-1} + v_{j-m-1}3^{-1}]$ for $m < j \le 2m+1$; they cover $\tfrac13 C_n$ and $\tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C_n$ respectively, hence cover $C_{n+1}$, and their total length is $3^{-1}(2 \cdot 3^{-1})^{n} + 3^{-1}(2 \cdot 3^{-1})^{n} = (2 \cdot 3^{-1})^{n+1}$ by [L11] and [L12]. Since $0 < 2 \cdot 3^{-1} < 1$ by [L12], [L10] gives, for every real $\varepsilon > 0$, an $n$ with $(2 \cdot 3^{-1})^{n} \le \varepsilon$; as $C \subseteq C_n$ by [L1], the corresponding finite list covers $C$ with total length at most $\varepsilon$. So $C$ has content zero by [L6], and hence measure zero by [L6]. [L1, L6, L10, L11, L12]

2.1 **$C$ is perfect, claim 3.** $C$ is closed by step 1.1. Let $x \in C$ and let the real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. By [L2] write $x = \Phi(a)$ with $a \in D$. By [L10] and [L12] fix $k \in \mathbb{N}$ with $2 \cdot 3^{-k-1} < \varepsilon$, and define $b \in D$ by $b_j := a_j$ for $j \ne k$ and $b_k := 2 - a_k$, so $b_k \in \{0,2\}$ and $b \ne a$. Then $\Phi(b) \in C$ and $\Phi(b) \ne \Phi(a)$ by [L2], while $\Phi(b) - \Phi(a) = \sum_{j \ge 0}(b_j - a_j)3^{-j-1} = (b_k - a_k)3^{-k-1}$ by [L2], all other terms being $0$, so $|\Phi(b) - x| = 2 \cdot 3^{-k-1} < \varepsilon$ by [L10]. Thus $N_\varepsilon(x)$ contains a point of $C$ other than $x$, for every $\varepsilon$, so $x$ is not isolated in $C$; by [L7] $C$ is perfect. [step 1.1, L2, L7, L10, L12]

2.2 **$C$ contains no nondegenerate interval and is nowhere dense, claim 5.** By step 1.2 the set $C$ is null, so by [L6] it contains no $[u,v]$ with $u < v$; in particular it contains no interval of any of the four bounded forms with distinct endpoints, since such an interval contains a closed one with distinct endpoints by [L6] and [L12]. Its interior is therefore empty: if $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq C$ for some real $\varepsilon > 0$, then $[x - \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1},\, x + \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}] \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq C$ by [L3] and [L12], an interval with distinct endpoints. Since $C$ is closed by step 1.1, it equals its closure, so [L8] gives that $C$ is nowhere dense. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L3, L6, L8, L12]

3.1 **$C$ is uncountable, claim 4.** $C$ is nonempty, since $0 \in C$ by [L1], and perfect by step 2.1, so [L7] applies. [step 2.1, L1, L7]

3.2 **Connected subsets, claim 6.** Let $E \subseteq C$ be connected and nonempty. By [L9] $E$ is order-convex, so if $u, v \in E$ with $u < v$ then $[u,v] \subseteq E \subseteq C$, contradicting step 2.2. Hence no two distinct elements of $E$ exist, and $E$, being nonempty, is a single point. [step 2.2, L9, L12]

4.1 Claims 1 to 6 are steps 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 3.1, 2.2 and 3.2 respectively, so all six hold. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, step 3.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Two independent proofs of uncountability.** The route above is [[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]] applied to a nonempty perfect set. The other is claim 3 of [[thm-cantor-set-ternary-description]]: $C$ is in bijection with $\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$, which is in bijection with the power set of $\mathbb{N}$, uncountable by [[thm-cantor-powerset]]. The two arguments share nothing, and the second is the one that makes the *size* of $C$ evident: $C$ is in bijection with the power set of $\mathbb{N}$, while having content zero. **It is deliberately not said here that $C$ has as many points as $\mathbb{R}$.** That would require a bijection between $\mathbb{R}$ and the power set of $\mathbb{N}$, and no such bijection is constructed anywhere at this point in the reading order; the two uncountability results available here are separate facts, one proved by the diagonal argument on power sets and one by nested intervals.

- **Claim 2 and claim 4 together are the point of the whole construction.** A set of measure zero may be uncountable, so nullity is not a cardinality condition; and a nowhere dense set need not be null, so it is not a category condition either ([[fs-nowhere-dense-implies-measure-zero]], [[thm-fat-cantor-set-has-positive-measure]]).

- **Why claim 5 is proved through measure and not by inspection.** The intervals making up $C_n$ have length $3^{-n}$, and one can see directly that a long interval cannot fit inside $C$. Doing that rigorously means keeping track of the $2^n$ component intervals of $C_n$ and their gaps; going through [[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]] uses the estimate already made in step 1.2 and needs no such bookkeeping.

- **Every point of $C$ is a limit of other points of $C$, and the witnesses are explicit**: change one ternary digit far out, as step 2.1 does. This is also what shows $C$ has no isolated points without any appeal to the structure of its complement.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with closure $\overline{A}$ as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]] and derived set $A'$ as in
[[def-limit-point-r]]. Write

$$E \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing \text{ for every real } \varepsilon > 0 \,\}$$

for the set of adherent points of $A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). Then:

1. $\overline{A} = E$.
2. $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$.
3. $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed superset of $A$: it is closed, it
   contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed $F$ with $A \subseteq F$.
4. $A$ is closed if and only if $A = \overline{A}$, if and only if
   $A' \subseteq A$.

Claim 3 is the content of the definition of $\overline{A}$ and is restated here
so that the four descriptions stand together; claims 1, 2 and 4 are the ones
that carry work.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, and the set $E$ of adherent points of $A$ as displayed in the Statement.

[L1] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; $F$ is closed when $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L2] $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$; $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) = N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$; and if $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ then $\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ and $N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] $\overline{A}$ is the intersection of the nonempty family of closed supersets of $A$; it is closed, it contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed superset of $A$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]).

[L4] $x$ is an adherent point of $A$ when every $N_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $A$, a limit point when every $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $A$, and $A'$ is the set of limit points ([[def-limit-point-r]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $A \subseteq E$: for $x \in A$ and any $\varepsilon > 0$ one has $x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$, so that intersection is nonempty. [L2, L4]

1.2 Let $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus E$; by the definition of $E$ there is a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$. [L4, choose]

1.3 Let $F$ be closed with $A \subseteq F$, and let $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus F$; since $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open there is a real $\eta > 0$ with $N_\eta(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus F$. [L1, choose]

2.1 For every $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ the radius $\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x|$ is positive and $N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, so $N_\delta(y) \cap A = \varnothing$ and $y \notin E$; hence $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$, and since $x$ was an arbitrary point of $\mathbb{R} \setminus E$ that set is open, that is, $E$ is closed. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L4]

2.2 From $N_\eta(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus F \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus A$ we get $N_\eta(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, so $x \notin E$; hence $\mathbb{R} \setminus F \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$, that is, $E \subseteq F$, for every closed $F \supseteq A$. [step 1.3, L4]

3.1 By steps 1.1 and 2.1 the set $E$ is a closed superset of $A$, so $\overline{A} \subseteq E$ by the leastness in [L3]; and $\overline{A}$ is itself a closed superset of $A$ by [L3], so step 2.2 applied to $F = \overline{A}$ gives $E \subseteq \overline{A}$. Hence $\overline{A} = E$, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, L3]

4.1 $E = A \cup A'$: if $x \in E$ and $x \notin A$ then for every $\varepsilon > 0$ some $a \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ exists, and $a \ne x$ because $x \notin A$, so $a \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ and $x \in A'$; conversely $A \subseteq E$ by step 1.1, and $A' \subseteq E$ because $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$. Combining with step 3.1 gives $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$, which is claim 2. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L2, L4]

5.1 Claim 4: if $A$ is closed then $A$ is a closed superset of itself, so $\overline{A} \subseteq A$ by [L3], while $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ by [L3], whence $A = \overline{A}$; conversely if $A = \overline{A}$ then $A$ is closed because $\overline{A}$ is. Finally $A = \overline{A}$ says $A = A \cup A'$ by step 4.1, and $A = A \cup A'$ holds exactly when $A' \subseteq A$. [step 4.1, L3]

6.1 Claim 3 is [L3] restated, and claims 1, 2 and 4 are steps 3.1, 4.1 and 5.1, so all four hold. [step 3.1, step 4.1, step 5.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Which claim does the work in practice.** Claim 1 is the one used almost
  everywhere below: to show a point lies in $\overline{A}$ one exhibits, for each
  $\varepsilon > 0$, a point of $A$ within $\varepsilon$ of it. Claim 2 is what
  separates the two ways a point can be adherent, by membership or by
  accumulation, and it is what makes the notion of an isolated point visible.

- **No special property of $\mathbb{R}$ is used.** The argument uses the
  definitions of open, closed, neighbourhood and closure, and the order enters
  only through the nesting property of neighbourhoods; neither the
  least-upper-bound property nor the Archimedean property appears at any step.
  The results of this page that do use them are flagged in
  [[rem-r-native-topology-scope]].

- **The sequential form is a separate theorem and costs more.** Replacing
  "every neighbourhood meets $A$" by "some sequence in $A$ converges to $x$" is
  [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]], and the passage from the
  first to the second spends the axiom of countable choice, since it selects one
  point of $A$ from each of infinitely many neighbourhoods. The characterisation
  proved above is choice free.

## Statement

$\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-equinumerous]]): the
plane of pairs of naturals is countably infinite ([[def-countable]]).

The bijection is exhibited, not merely asserted to exist. Define $2^m$ by
recursion on $m$ ([[thm-recursion]]) by $2^0 = 1$ and $2^{\sigma(m)} = 2^m + 2^m$,
and set

$$J(m,n) = 2^m \cdot \sigma(n + n), \qquad \text{that is} \qquad J(m,n) = 2^m(2n+1).$$

Then $J$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ onto
$\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, and $\sigma$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N}$ onto
$\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, so $\sigma^{-1} \circ J$ is a bijection
$\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$. What makes $J$ bijective is the
decomposition of a nonzero natural into a power of two times an odd number,
existence and uniqueness both.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Addition and multiplication on $\mathbb{N}$ with $m + 0 = m$, $m + \sigma(k) = \sigma(m + k)$, $m \cdot 0 = 0$ and $m \cdot \sigma(k) = m \cdot k + m$ ([[def-nat-addition]], [[def-nat-multiplication]]); $1 := \sigma(0)$. Call $k \in \mathbb{N}$ **even** if $k = j + j$ for some $j$ and **odd** if $k = \sigma(j + j)$ for some $j$.

[L1] Recursion: for a set $X$, $x_0 \in X$ and $F : X \to X$ there is $h : \mathbb{N} \to X$ with $h(0) = x_0$ and $h(\sigma(m)) = F(h(m))$ ([[thm-recursion]]).

[L2] Peano: $\sigma(k) \ne 0$ and $\sigma$ is injective ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]); every nonzero natural is a successor ([[lem-nat-nonzero-is-successor]]).

[L3] Arithmetic laws: $+$ and $\cdot$ are commutative and associative, $1 \cdot n = n = n \cdot 1$, $0 + n = n$, $a(b + c) = ab + ac$ and $\sigma(a) + n = \sigma(a + n)$ ([[lem-nat-add-commutative]], [[lem-nat-add-associative]], [[lem-nat-add-identity]], [[lem-nat-mult-commutative]], [[lem-nat-mult-associative]], [[lem-nat-mult-identity]], [[lem-nat-mult-distributive]], [[lem-nat-add-successor-left]]).

[L4] Order laws: exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds ([[lem-nat-trichotomy]]); $\le$ is reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive and total ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]), so $<$ is transitive and mixes with $\le$, in the sense that each of $a < b < c$, $a \le b < c$ and $a < b \le c$ gives $a < c$: transitivity of $\le$ gives $a \le c$ in every case, while $a = c$ would force $b = c$ or $a = b$ by antisymmetry, contradicting whichever of the two hypotheses is strict; and $<$ is irreflexive, because $a < a$ would demand $a \ne a$ ([[def-nat-order]]); $a \le b \iff a + k \le b + k$ and $a < b \iff a + k < b + k$ ([[lem-nat-order-add-compatible]]); $a < b \iff \sigma(a) \le b$, so $a < \sigma(a)$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]); and $a \le b$ means $a + c = b$ for some $c$ ([[def-nat-order]]), where moreover $a < b$ holds exactly when that $c$ is nonzero, since $c = 0$ gives $b = a$, while $c \ne 0$ with $a = b$ would give $c + a = a + c = a = 0 + a$ and hence $c = 0$ by additive cancellation ([[lem-nat-add-cancellative]], [[lem-nat-add-commutative]], [[lem-nat-add-identity]]).

[L5] Cancellation: $a \cdot k = b \cdot k$ with $k \ne 0$ gives $a = b$ ([[lem-nat-mult-cancellative]]); and $a \cdot b = 0$ forces $a = 0$ or $b = 0$ ([[lem-nat-no-zero-divisors]]).

[L6] Induction ([[thm-induction-principle]]) and strong induction ([[thm-strong-induction]]).

[L7] Bijections, injections, surjections, composition and inverses ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]); $A \approx B$ means a bijection $A \to B$ exists ([[def-equinumerous]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Apply [L1] with $X = \mathbb{N}$, $x_0 = 1$ and $F(x) = x + x$: this defines $m \mapsto 2^m$ with $2^0 = 1$ and $2^{\sigma(m)} = 2^m + 2^m$ for all $m$. [L1, construct]

1.2 Every natural is even or odd: by induction, $0 = 0 + 0$ is even; and if $k = j + j$ is even then $\sigma(k) = \sigma(j + j)$ is odd, while if $k = \sigma(j + j)$ is odd then $\sigma(k) = \sigma(\sigma(j+j)) = \sigma(\sigma(j) + j) = \sigma(j) + \sigma(j)$ is even, using $\sigma(j) + j = \sigma(j + j)$ and $x + \sigma(y) = \sigma(x + y)$. [L3, L6, given]

1.3 No natural is both even and odd, that is $j + j \ne \sigma(i + i)$ for all $i, j$: if $j \le i$ then $j + j \le i + j = j + i \le i + i < \sigma(i + i)$; if $i < j$ then $\sigma(i) \le j$, so $\sigma(i+i) < \sigma(\sigma(i+i)) = \sigma(\sigma(i) + i) = \sigma(i) + \sigma(i) \le j + j$; in both cases the two sides differ by irreflexivity of $<$. [L3, L4, given]

1.4 $\sigma$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N}$ onto $\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$: it is injective by [L2], its values are nonzero by [L2], and every nonzero natural is a value of $\sigma$ by [L2]. [L2, L7]

2.1 $2^m \ne 0$ for every $m$: by induction, $2^0 = \sigma(0) \ne 0$; and if $2^m \ne 0$ then $2^m = \sigma(a)$ for some $a$ by [L2], so $2^{\sigma(m)} = 2^m + 2^m = 2^m + \sigma(a) = \sigma(2^m + a) \ne 0$. [step 1.1, L2, L6, given]

2.2 $2^{m + d} = 2^m \cdot 2^d$ for all $m, d$: by induction on $d$, at $d = 0$ both sides are $2^m$ since $m + 0 = m$ and $2^m \cdot 1 = 2^m$; and if $2^{m+d} = 2^m \cdot 2^d$ then $2^{m + \sigma(d)} = 2^{\sigma(m+d)} = 2^{m+d} + 2^{m+d} = 2^m 2^d + 2^m 2^d = 2^m (2^d + 2^d) = 2^m \cdot 2^{\sigma(d)}$. [step 1.1, L3, L6, given]

3.1 Define $J : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ by $J(m,n) = 2^m \cdot \sigma(n+n)$. Its values are nonzero: $2^m \ne 0$ by step 2.1 and $\sigma(n+n) \ne 0$ by [L2], so $J(m,n) \ne 0$ by [L5]. Thus $J$ maps into $\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L2, L5, construct]

4.1 $J$ is injective. Suppose $2^m \sigma(n+n) = 2^{m'} \sigma(n'+n')$; by [L4] we may assume $m \le m'$, the other case being symmetric, and write $m' = m + d$. By step 2.2 the right side is $2^m (2^d \sigma(n'+n'))$, so cancelling the nonzero factor $2^m$ with [L5] and [L3] gives $\sigma(n+n) = 2^d \cdot \sigma(n'+n')$. If $d \ne 0$ then $d = \sigma(e)$ by [L2] and $2^d = 2^e + 2^e$, so the right side equals $w + w$ with $w = 2^e \sigma(n'+n')$, by [L3]; that would make $\sigma(n+n)$ both odd and even, contradicting step 1.3. Hence $d = 0$ and $m' = m$, and then $\sigma(n+n) = \sigma(n'+n')$ gives $n + n = n' + n'$ by injectivity of $\sigma$, whence $n = n'$ because $n < n'$ would force $n + n < n' + n = n + n' < n' + n'$ by [L4] and [L3], and symmetrically for $n' < n$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, L2, L3, L4, L5]

4.2 $J$ is surjective onto $\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$: by strong induction [L6] we show every $k$ is $0$ or a value of $J$. Let $k \ne 0$ and assume the claim for all $j < k$. By step 1.2, $k$ is odd or even. If $k = \sigma(j+j)$ then $k = 1 \cdot \sigma(j+j) = 2^0 \sigma(j+j) = J(0,j)$ by [L3]. If $k = j + j$ then $j \ne 0$, since $j = 0$ would give $k = 0$; also $j < j + j = k$ by [L4], because $j + j = k$ with $j \ne 0$; so the hypothesis at $j$ and $j \ne 0$ give $j = 2^m \sigma(n+n)$ for some $m, n$, and then $k = j + j = 2^m \sigma(n+n) + 2^m \sigma(n+n) = (2^m + 2^m) \sigma(n+n) = 2^{\sigma(m)} \sigma(n+n) = J(\sigma(m), n)$ by [L3] and step 1.1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 3.1, L3, L4, L6]

5.1 Therefore $J$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ onto $\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, and composing with the inverse of the bijection $\sigma$ of step 1.4 yields the bijection $\sigma^{-1} \circ J : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$; hence $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \approx \mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ is countably infinite. [step 1.4, step 4.1, step 4.2, L7] ∎

## Remarks

- Written out, $\sigma^{-1}(J(m,n)) = 2^m(2n+1) - 1$, the standard bijection. The detour through $\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$ avoids subtraction, which the naturals do not have as a total operation.

- The proof is a proof of unique factorisation into a power of two times an odd number: step 4.2 is existence and step 4.1 is uniqueness. Nothing weaker would do, and no appeal to a picture of the diagonal enumeration is made anywhere. Nothing here uses any choice principle.

- The Cantor pairing polynomial $(m,n) \mapsto \tfrac{(m+n)(m+n+1)}{2} + n$ is an alternative bijection. It is not used because halving is not available in $\mathbb{N}$ without first developing division with remainder, whereas doubling, which is all $2^m$ needs, is immediate from addition.

## Statement

For each $k \in \mathbb{N}$ let $I_k = [a_k, b_k]$ be a closed bounded interval
with $a_k \le b_k$ ([[def-interval]]), and suppose the family is **nested**:

$$I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k \qquad (k \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Write $\ell_k = b_k - a_k \ge 0$ for the length of $I_k$. Then:

1. $\displaystyle\bigcap_{k \in \mathbb{N}} I_k$ is **nonempty**. More precisely,
   with $a = \sup\{a_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$ and
   $b = \inf\{b_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$, both of which exist, one has $a \le b$
   and $$\bigcap_{k \in \mathbb{N}} I_k = [a, b].$$
2. $\displaystyle\bigcap_{k \in \mathbb{N}} I_k$ is a **single point** if and only
   if $\ell_k \to 0$ ([[def-real-limit]]).

Every hypothesis is load bearing. Dropping closedness makes the intersection
empty; dropping boundedness does the same; and dropping nonemptiness of the
individual intervals is vacuously fatal.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Closed bounded intervals $I_k = [a_k, b_k]$ with $a_k \le b_k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and $I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k$ for every $k$; the sequences $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ of reals ([[def-sequence]]); their ranges $A = \{a_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$ and $B = \{b_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$, both nonempty; and $\ell_k = b_k - a_k$.

[L1] Closed bounded intervals: $[a,b] = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : a \le x \le b\}$; it is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, it is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$, it has two distinct elements $a$ and $b$ when $a < b$, and its length is $b - a$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L2] Least-upper-bound property and uniqueness: a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ bounded above has a unique supremum; the supremum is an upper bound and is $\le$ every upper bound ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L3] Greatest-lower-bound property and uniqueness: a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ bounded below has a unique infimum; the infimum is a lower bound and is $\ge$ every lower bound ([[thm-infimum-property]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L4] Monotone sequences, and the fact that consecutive comparisons suffice: $x_k \le x_{k+1}$ for all $k$ makes $(x_k)$ nondecreasing, and $x_{k+1} \le x_k$ for all $k$ makes it nonincreasing ([[def-monotone-sequence]]).

[L5] Monotone convergence: a nondecreasing sequence whose range is bounded above converges to the supremum of its range, and a nonincreasing sequence whose range is bounded below converges to the infimum ([[thm-monotone-convergence]]).

[L6] Algebra of limits: if $u_k \to u$ and $v_k \to v$ then $u_k - v_k \to u - v$ ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]]).

[L7] A sequence of reals has at most one limit ([[lem-limit-unique]]).

[L8] Bounded above and bounded below, for a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-bounded-set]]).

[L9] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total and transitive, so any two indices $k, l$ admit an index $m$ with $k \le m$ and $l \le m$, namely the larger of the two ([[def-nat-order]], [[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Nestedness read on the endpoints: since $a_{k+1} \le b_{k+1}$, both $a_{k+1}$ and $b_{k+1}$ lie in $I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k$, so $a_k \le a_{k+1}$ and $b_{k+1} \le b_k$ for every $k$. [given, L1]

2.1 Hence $(a_k)$ is nondecreasing and $(b_k)$ is nonincreasing. [step 1.1, L4]

3.1 For all indices $k$ and $l$: choosing $m$ with $k \le m$ and $l \le m$ gives $a_k \le a_m \le b_m \le b_l$, so $a_k \le b_l$. [step 2.1, given, L9]

4.1 Every $b_l$ is therefore an upper bound of $A$ and every $a_k$ a lower bound of $B$; both sets are nonempty, so $a := \sup A$ and $b := \inf B$ exist and are unique. [step 3.1, L2, L3, L8]

5.1 $a \le b$: each $b_l$ is an upper bound of $A$, so $a \le b_l$ for every $l$ by leastness of the supremum; thus $a$ is a lower bound of $B$, and $a \le b$ by greatestness of the infimum. [step 4.1, L2, L3]

5.2 By monotone convergence, $a_k \to a$ and $b_k \to b$. [step 2.1, step 4.1, L5]

5.3 The intersection is exactly $[a,b]$: a real $x$ lies in every $I_k$ exactly when $a_k \le x \le b_k$ for every $k$, that is exactly when $x$ is an upper bound of $A$ and a lower bound of $B$, and by leastness of $a$ and greatestness of $b$ that holds exactly when $a \le x \le b$. [step 4.1, L1, L2, L3]

6.1 $\ell_k = b_k - a_k \to b - a$ by the algebra of limits. [step 5.2, L6]

6.2 Since $a \le b$, the interval $[a,b]$ is nonempty, so the intersection is nonempty; together with step 5.3 this is claim 1. [step 5.1, step 5.3, L1]

7.1 If $\ell_k \to 0$ then $b - a = 0$ by uniqueness of limits, so $a = b$ and the intersection is $[a,a] = \{a\}$, a single point. [step 5.3, step 6.1, L1, L7]

7.2 Conversely, if the intersection is a single point then $a = b$: it equals $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, and $a < b$ would give the two distinct elements $a$ and $b$. Hence $b - a = 0$ and $\ell_k \to 0$ by step 6.1. [step 5.1, step 5.3, step 6.1, L1]

8.1 Claim 1 is step 6.2 and claim 2 is the pair of implications in steps 7.1 and 7.2, so a nested sequence of nonempty closed bounded intervals has nonempty intersection, equal to $[a,b]$, and that intersection is a single point exactly when the lengths tend to $0$. [step 6.2, step 7.1, step 7.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **No Archimedean input is needed.** The lengths are handled entirely by the
  algebra of limits and the uniqueness of limits: $\ell_k$ always converges, to
  $b - a$, and the two directions of claim 2 are then the two directions of
  "$b - a = 0$". A proof that instead argues "if $b - a > 0$ then some $\ell_k$
  is smaller" does need the Archimedean property
  ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]]), and it is avoidable, so it is avoided.

- **Nestedness gives more than it is usually stated to give.** The intersection
  is not merely nonempty; it is the closed interval $[a,b]$, and $a$ and $b$ are
  the limits of the endpoint sequences. The single-point case is exactly the case
  in which those two limits agree, and that is what makes the nested interval
  property usable as a *construction* of a real number, as in
  [[ex-nested-intervals-single-point]].

- **This is one of the standard equivalents of completeness.** Nested intervals
  together with the Archimedean property imply the least-upper-bound property, so
  the implication proved here is not reversible for free: it is half of an
  equivalence whose other half needs the Archimedean hypothesis separately.
  [[rem-completeness-routes]] records where this library stands on those routes.

- **The witnesses for the two deleted hypotheses** are
  [[cex-nested-open-intervals-empty]], which keeps boundedness and drops
  closedness, and [[cex-nested-unbounded-closed-empty]], which keeps closedness
  and drops boundedness. Neither is used above; each shows that the corresponding
  hypothesis cannot be removed.

## Statement

$\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-equinumerous]]): the rationals are
countably infinite ([[def-countable]]).

**No choice principle is used.** The one place where a reader expects a choice,
"pick a representative $a/b$ of each rational", is exactly where
[[lem-rat-positive-denominator]] applies: every rational *has* a representative
with positive denominator, so the map $(a,b) \mapsto [(a,b)]$ defined on
$\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ is already **surjective** onto $\mathbb{Q}$,
and countability follows from a surjection without ever selecting a
representative. The same device handles $\mathbb{Z}$, which is a surjective image
of $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ by construction ([[def-integers]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $\mathbb{Z} = (\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N})/\sim$ with quotient map $(a,b) \mapsto [(a,b)]$ ([[def-integers]]), and $\mathbb{Q}$ the set of classes $[(a,b)]$ of pairs of integers with $b \ne 0$ ([[def-rationals]]). Write $\mathbb{Z}_{>0} = \{\, b \in \mathbb{Z} : b > 0 \,\}$ ([[def-int-order]]).

[L1] Finite, countably infinite, at most countable, uncountable ([[def-countable]]).

[L2] Bijections, injections, surjections, composition; $\approx$ and $\preceq$ ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]], [[def-equinumerous]]).

[L3] A nonempty $X$ is at most countable iff there is a surjection $\mathbb{N} \to X$; and from such a surjection $s$ the map $x \mapsto \min\{\, k : s(k) = x \,\}$ is an injection $X \to \mathbb{N}$ ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]]).

[L4] There is a bijection $\beta : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-n-cross-n-countable]]).

[L5] A product of two at most countable sets is at most countable ([[thm-product-of-countable]]); a subset of an at most countable set is at most countable ([[lem-subset-of-countable]]).

[L6] Every rational is $[(a,b)]$ for some integers $a$ and $b$ with $b > 0$ ([[lem-rat-positive-denominator]]).

[L7] $\mathbb{N}$ embeds injectively in $\mathbb{Z}$ by $n \mapsto [(n,0)]$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]) and $\mathbb{Z}$ embeds injectively in $\mathbb{Q}$ by $k \mapsto [(k,1)]$ ([[lem-int-embeds-rat]]).

[L8] $\preceq$ in both directions gives $\approx$ ([[thm-schroder-bernstein]]).

[L9] The relation of [[def-int-order]] is a total order on $\mathbb{Z}$ compatible with the ring structure ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), and $\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \ne \varnothing$: on representatives $0 < [(a,b)]$ holds exactly when $b < a$ in $\mathbb{N}$ ([[def-int-order]]), and $0 < 1$ in $\mathbb{N}$, since $1 = \sigma(0) \ne 0$ ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]) while $0 < n$ for every nonzero natural $n$ (claim 4 of [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]); so the integer $[(1,0)]$ is positive.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The quotient map $\pi : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$, $\pi(a,b) = [(a,b)]$, is surjective, since every integer is by definition such a class; hence $\pi \circ \beta : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ is a surjection, and $\mathbb{Z} \ne \varnothing$, so $\mathbb{Z}$ is at most countable by [L3]. [given, L2, L3, L4]

1.2 The composite $\iota : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$, $n \mapsto [([(n,0)],1)]$, of the two embeddings of [L7] is injective, so $\mathbb{N} \preceq \mathbb{Q}$. [L2, L7]

2.1 $\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ is a subset of $\mathbb{Z}$, hence at most countable by [L5], and it is nonempty by [L9]; therefore $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ is at most countable by [L5] and nonempty, so [L3] provides a surjection $u : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$. [step 1.1, L3, L5, L9]

3.1 The map $\rho : \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_{>0} \to \mathbb{Q}$, $\rho(a,b) = [(a,b)]$, is well defined because $b > 0$ gives $b \ne 0$, and it is surjective by [L6]; hence $\rho \circ u : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$ is a surjection, $\mathbb{Q}$ is at most countable, and [L3] turns that surjection into an injection $j : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{N}$, so $\mathbb{Q} \preceq \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.1, given, L2, L3, L6]

4.1 From $\mathbb{N} \preceq \mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{Q} \preceq \mathbb{N}$, the Schröder-Bernstein theorem [L8] yields a bijection $\mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{N}$; hence $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ is countably infinite. [step 1.2, step 3.1, L1, L8] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why Schröder-Bernstein rather than a count.** The usual last line is "countable, and infinite because $\mathbb{N}$ injects into it". Turning that into a proof requires knowing that a set containing an injective copy of $\mathbb{N}$ is not finite, which is the pigeonhole principle, [[lem-pigeonhole]], proved earlier on this page. That route is now available, but it is a detour: [[thm-schroder-bernstein]] gets the bijection directly from the two injections already in hand, and it is choice free, so nothing is lost.

- **Lowest terms are not needed and are not available.** A frequent presentation injects $\mathbb{Q}$ into $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{N}$ by sending each rational to its representative in lowest terms. That map needs greatest common divisors, which this library has not developed. Working with a surjection instead of an injection avoids the issue entirely: repetitions in an enumeration are harmless ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]]).

- The proof shows in passing that $\mathbb{Z} \approx \mathbb{N}$, by the same two-injection argument applied to [L7] and step 1.1, and that $\mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{Q}^3$ and so on are countable ([[thm-product-of-countable]]). The contrast with [[thm-r-uncountable]] is the point of the page: adding all limits of rational approximations to $\mathbb{Q}$ changes the size of the set, not merely its arithmetic.
