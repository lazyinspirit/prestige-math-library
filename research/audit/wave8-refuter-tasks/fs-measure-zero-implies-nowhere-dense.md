## Statement

**False claim:** every subset of $\mathbb{R}$ of measure zero
([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]) is nowhere dense
([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]]).

The claim confuses two different smallness conditions. Measure zero constrains
the total length of a cover; nowhere density constrains the *closure*. A set may
be covered by intervals of total length below any $\varepsilon$ and still have
every real as an adherent point, and $\mathbb{Q}$ does exactly that.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The set $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ of rationals, that is the image of $\mathbb{Q}$ under the canonical embedding ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[A1] The false claim: every subset of $\mathbb{R}$ of measure zero is nowhere dense.

[L1] $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$, so $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is at most countable ([[thm-rationals-countable]], [[def-countable]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L2] Every at most countable subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has measure zero ([[lem-countable-sets-are-null]]).

[L3] $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$, that is $\overline{\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}} = \mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L4] A set is nowhere dense when the interior of its closure is empty; the interior of an open set is itself, and $\mathbb{R}$ is open ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ has measure zero, being at most countable by [L1] and hence null by [L2]. [L1, L2]

1.2 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is not nowhere dense: its closure is $\mathbb{R}$ by [L3], and the interior of $\mathbb{R}$ is $\mathbb{R}$ itself by [L4], since $\mathbb{R}$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$; so the interior of the closure is $\mathbb{R} \ne \varnothing$. [L3, L4]

2.1 So $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ of measure zero that is not nowhere dense, and the claim [A1] fails at it; the claim is therefore false. [step 1.1, step 1.2, A1] ∎

## Remarks

- **$\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is nonetheless meager**, being a union of countably
  many singletons, each of which *is* nowhere dense
  ([[cor-q-is-meager-and-not-g-delta]]). So the failure above is not a failure of
  topological smallness in every sense: it is exactly the failure of the
  one-step condition. Meagreness is the countable-union closure of nowhere
  density, and it is the notion under which $\mathbb{Q}$ is small.

- **The converse implication is also false**, and needs an uncountable witness:
  the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set is nowhere dense and not null
  ([[fs-nowhere-dense-implies-measure-zero]]).

- **The named witness** is [[cex-dense-set-of-measure-zero]].

## Statement refuted

**Refuted claim:** every subset of $\mathbb{R}$ of measure zero is nowhere dense
([[fs-measure-zero-implies-nowhere-dense]]).

The witness is $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, the set of rationals inside
$\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]). It is at most countable, hence null
([[lem-countable-sets-are-null]]), and it is dense, so its closure is
$\mathbb{R}$ and the interior of that closure is $\mathbb{R}$, as far from empty
as possible. The refutation is carried out in full in
[[fs-measure-zero-implies-nowhere-dense]]; this item records the witness and the
explicit cover.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The set $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ of rationals.

[A1] The refuted claim: every subset of $\mathbb{R}$ of measure zero is nowhere dense.

[L1] $\mathbb{Q}$ is countably infinite, so $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is at most countable and therefore null ([[thm-rationals-countable]], [[def-countable]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]], [[lem-countable-sets-are-null]], [[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

[L2] $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is dense: $\overline{\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}} = \mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]).

[L3] Nowhere dense means the interior of the closure is empty; $\mathbb{R}$ is open, so its interior is itself ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ has measure zero, by [L1]. [L1]

1.2 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is not nowhere dense: its closure is $\mathbb{R}$ by [L2] and the interior of $\mathbb{R}$ is $\mathbb{R}$ by [L3], which is not empty. [L2, L3]

2.1 So $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ witnesses the failure of [A1]. [step 1.1, step 1.2, A1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The cover is explicit and startling.** For every $\varepsilon > 0$ the rationals are covered by open intervals of total length exactly $\varepsilon$ ([[ex-q-covered-by-intervals-of-small-total-length]]), although their union is dense because it contains $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$.

- **$\mathbb{Q}$ is small in the other sense too, one level up.** It is meager, being a countable union of singletons ([[cor-q-is-meager-and-not-g-delta]]); what fails is only nowhere density itself. So the counterexample separates "nowhere dense" from "meager", not category from measure.

- **The complementary witness** is the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set, nowhere dense and not null ([[cex-nowhere-dense-with-positive-measure]]).

## Statement

Write $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the image of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$
under the canonical embedding $q \mapsto \hat q$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), the
set usually written $\mathbb{Q}$ once the identification is made, and put
$X := \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the irrationals. Then:

1. $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is an $F_\sigma$ set ([[def-f-sigma-g-delta]]) and is
   meager ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]]);
2. $X$ is a $G_\delta$ set and is residual;
3. $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is **not** a $G_\delta$ set, and $X$ is **not** an
   $F_\sigma$ set.

Claims 1 and 2 are bookkeeping. Claim 3 is the substance and is exactly where
[[thm-baire-category-r]] is spent: no argument from the algebra of open and
closed sets alone can reach it, since $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and $X$ are
interchanged by complementation while $F_\sigma$ and $G_\delta$ are, so any such
argument would prove the same thing about both sets and about neither.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The complete ordered field $\mathbb{R}$, the set $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ of rationals and its complement $X = \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$.

[L1] $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-rationals-countable]], [[def-equinumerous]]), $q \mapsto \hat q$ is injective with image $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and a composition of bijections is a bijection ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]); an at most countable family may be presented as a sequence indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ ([[def-countable]]).

[L2] $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]); a set is dense when its closure is $\mathbb{R}$, equivalently when every $N_\varepsilon(x)$ meets it ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]); the closure operator is monotone, so a superset of a dense set is dense ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]).

[L3] $U$ is open when every point of it has a neighbourhood inside it, and $F$ is closed when $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open; $N_\varepsilon(x) = (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon)$ and $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L4] A closed set is nowhere dense exactly when its interior is empty; a meager set is a union of a sequence of nowhere dense sets; residual means the complement is meager ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]]).

[L5] $A$ is $F_\sigma$ when it is the union of a sequence of closed sets and $G_\delta$ when it is the intersection of a sequence of open sets; $A$ is $F_\sigma$ if and only if $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ is $G_\delta$ ([[def-f-sigma-g-delta]]).

[L6] A countable intersection of dense open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ is dense ([[thm-baire-category-r]]).

[L7] There is a bijection $J : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-n-cross-n-countable]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 For $c \in \mathbb{R}$ the singleton $\{c\}$ is closed and nowhere dense: its complement is open, since $x \ne c$ gives $N_{|x-c|}(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus \{c\}$ by [L3]; and its interior is empty, since for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the point $c + \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$ lies in $N_\varepsilon(c)$ and differs from $c$, so no neighbourhood is contained in $\{c\}$, whence $\{c\}$ is a closed set with empty interior and [L4] applies. [L3, L4]

1.2 By [L1] fix a bijection $\beta : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$ and put $e := \iota \circ \beta$ with $\iota(q) = \hat q$, a bijection from $\mathbb{N}$ onto $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$. [L1, choose]

2.1 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \{e(n)\}$, since $e$ is onto $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$; the sets $\{e(n)\}$ are closed and nowhere dense by step 1.1, so $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is $F_\sigma$ by [L5] and meager by [L4]. This is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L4, L5]

3.1 Put $W_n := \mathbb{R} \setminus \{e(n)\}$, an open set by step 1.1 and [L3]. A real $x$ lies in $\bigcap_n W_n$ exactly when $x \ne e(n)$ for every $n$, that is, exactly when $x \notin \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, so $X = \bigcap_n W_n$ and $X$ is $G_\delta$ by [L5]; and $\mathbb{R} \setminus X = \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is meager by step 2.1, so $X$ is residual by [L4]. This is claim 2. Each $W_n$ is also dense, since every $N_\varepsilon(x)$ contains two distinct points and so meets $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{e(n)\}$, by [L2] and [L3]. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.1, L2, L3, L4, L5]

4.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is $G_\delta$, and by [L5] fix a sequence $(V_n)$ of open sets with $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} = \bigcap_n V_n$. Each $V_n$ contains $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, which is dense by [L2], so each $V_n$ is dense by [L2]; and each $W_n$ of step 3.1 is open and dense. [assume-contra, step 3.1, L2, L5, choose]

5.1 By [L7] fix a bijection $J : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ and define a sequence $(D_j)$ by $D_{J(m,n)} := V_n$ when $m = 0$ and $D_{J(m,n)} := W_n$ when $m \ne 0$; this is total because $J$ is a bijection, and every $D_j$ is open and dense by step 4.1. Moreover $\bigcap_j D_j = \big(\bigcap_n V_n\big) \cap \big(\bigcap_n W_n\big) = \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \cap X = \varnothing$, since every $V_n$ and every $W_n$ occurs among the $D_j$ and every $D_j$ is one of them. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L7]

6.1 By [L6] the set $\bigcap_j D_j$ is dense, hence nonempty by [L2] and [L3], contradicting step 5.1. The assumption of step 4.1 is therefore untenable: $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is not $G_\delta$; and $X$ is not $F_\sigma$, since $\mathbb{R} \setminus X = \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ would then be $G_\delta$ by [L5]. This is claim 3. [step 4.1, step 5.1, L2, L3, L5, L6, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the two halves of the argument part company.** Claim 1 is a listing argument and would work equally in $\mathbb{Q}$ or in any countable space; claim 3 uses the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ through [[thm-nested-interval-property]], inside [[thm-baire-category-r]]. Indeed $\mathbb{Q}$ is a $G_\delta$ subset of itself, being the whole space, so no argument that ignores the ambient completeness can possibly give claim 3.

- **The irrationals are also uncountable** ([[cor-irrationals-uncountable]]), by a different and much cheaper argument that needs only the countability of $\mathbb{Q}$ and the uncountability of $\mathbb{R}$. Uncountability and being residual are independent properties: $\mathbb{Q}$ is meager and countable, the Cantor set is meager and uncountable ([[thm-cantor-set-properties]]), and $X$ is residual and uncountable.

- **The named witness for claim 3** is [[cex-irrationals-are-not-f-sigma]], and the false statement it refutes is [[fs-q-is-g-delta]]; the refutation is carried out here.

- **Meagre and measure zero are not the same smallness.** $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is both, but the two notions diverge as soon as one leaves the countable case: [[cex-meager-set-of-full-measure]] writes $\mathbb{R}$ as a meager set together with a set of measure zero, and the set of measure zero there is residual. So being residual, which is what claim 2 gives for $X$, carries no information at all about size in measure.

## Definition

Recall that a natural number is a von Neumann natural
([[def-natural-numbers]]): $0 = \varnothing$ and $\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$, so
that

$$n = \{\, m \in \mathbb{N} : m < n \,\} = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$$

is itself the set of its predecessors. Here $<$ is the order of
[[def-nat-order]], which is defined additively, so the displayed identity is a
theorem and not a convention: it is [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]], proved
immediately above. Let $A$ be a set, and let $\approx$ be equinumerosity
([[def-equinumerous]]).

- $A$ is **finite** if $A \approx n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
- $A$ is **countably infinite** if $A \approx \mathbb{N}$.
- $A$ is **at most countable** if it is finite or countably infinite.
- $A$ is **uncountable** if it is not at most countable.

## Remarks

- **Convention: in this library "countable" alone always means "at most
  countable"**, so a finite set is countable. This is the convention of Halmos
  and of Tao, and it is the one that makes the theorems on this page read
  cleanly: subsets, products and unions of countable sets are countable, with no
  finite/infinite case split in the statement. The competing convention, used by
  Rudin among others, reserves "countable" for "countably infinite" and says
  "at most countable" for the disjunction. Under that convention every statement
  below still holds after replacing "countable" with "at most countable", but
  several would become false as literally written. Where the distinction
  matters, the long forms "countably infinite" and "at most countable" are used
  in full, and "uncountable" always means "not at most countable", on which the
  two conventions agree.

- **The three classes are exhaustive by construction**: every set is finite,
  countably infinite, or uncountable, since "uncountable" is defined as the
  negation of the disjunction. That they are also mutually exclusive, that is,
  that no set is both finite and countably infinite, is a genuine theorem
  amounting to $\mathbb{N} \not\approx n$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and it is
  proved immediately above as claim 4 of [[lem-pigeonhole]]. So a countably
  infinite set is never finite, and "$A$ is infinite", meaning not finite, is
  implied by $A \approx \mathbb{N}$. The same lemma pins down finiteness itself:
  by its claim 3 a finite set is equinumerous with exactly one natural number, so
  the number of elements of a finite set is well defined, and by its claim 5 no
  finite set is equinumerous with a proper subset of itself.

- **What the exclusivity is and is not used for below.** Nothing on this page
  needs it in order to run: the infinitude of $\mathbb{Q}$, for instance, is
  obtained by exhibiting a bijection $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ directly
  ([[thm-rationals-countable]]) rather than by ruling out finiteness. It is used
  where the two notions of infinity are compared
  ([[fs-infinite-has-countable-subset-in-zf]]) and where the continuum hypothesis
  is instantiated at $\mathbb{N}$ ([[rem-continuum-hypothesis]]), both of which
  need $\mathbb{N}$ to be infinite as a fact rather than as a convention.

- **$0$ and the empty set.** $0 = \varnothing$, and $A \approx 0$ holds exactly
  when $A = \varnothing$, so the empty set is finite. This matters in the proofs
  below, where the empty case is always separated out: a surjection
  $\mathbb{N} \to A$ cannot exist when $A = \varnothing$, which is why
  [[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]] assumes $A$ nonempty.

- **Countability is a property of a set alone**, not of a set with structure. In
  particular $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable while carrying a dense order, and
  $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable; neither statement says anything on its own about
  the order or the arithmetic those sets carry.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with open and closed sets as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

- The **interior** of $A$ is the union of all open subsets of $A$:
  $$A^{\circ} \;:=\; \bigcup \{\, U \subseteq \mathbb{R} : U \text{ open and } U \subseteq A \,\}.$$
- The **closure** of $A$ is the intersection of all closed supersets of $A$:
  $$\overline{A} \;:=\; \bigcap \{\, F \subseteq \mathbb{R} : F \text{ closed and } A \subseteq F \,\}.$$
- The **boundary** of $A$ is $\partial A := \overline{A} \setminus A^{\circ}$.
- The **exterior** of $A$ is $\operatorname{ext} A := (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)^{\circ}$.

**Both operators are well defined and deliver what their names claim.** The
family whose union defines $A^{\circ}$ always contains $\varnothing$, and the
family whose intersection defines $\overline{A}$ always contains $\mathbb{R}$,
so the second family is nonempty and both expressions denote subsets of
$\mathbb{R}$ without appeal to any convention about empty unions or
intersections. Moreover:

- $A^{\circ}$ is **open**, being a union of open sets
  ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], claim 1), and $A^{\circ} \subseteq A$, since
  every set in the family is a subset of $A$. It is therefore the **largest**
  open subset of $A$: any open $U \subseteq A$ is a member of the family and so
  $U \subseteq A^{\circ}$.
- $\overline{A}$ is **closed**, being an intersection of a nonempty family of
  closed sets ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], claim 3), and $A \subseteq
  \overline{A}$, since every set in the family contains $A$. It is therefore the
  **smallest** closed superset of $A$: any closed $F \supseteq A$ is a member of
  the family and so $\overline{A} \subseteq F$.

**Pointwise description of the interior.** For $x \in \mathbb{R}$,

$$x \in A^{\circ} \iff \text{there is } \varepsilon > 0 \text{ with } N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A .$$

If $x \in A^{\circ}$ then, $A^{\circ}$ being open and containing $x$, there is
$\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A^{\circ} \subseteq A$.
Conversely if $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A$ then $N_\varepsilon(x)$ is an open
subset of $A$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) containing $x$, hence
$x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A^{\circ}$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

The corresponding pointwise description of the closure is not a definitional
matter and is proved separately, as [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

## Remarks

- **The four sets partition nothing by themselves, but three of them do.** For
  every $A$ the three sets $A^{\circ}$, $\partial A$ and $\operatorname{ext} A$
  are pairwise disjoint with union $\mathbb{R}$. This is not proved here and is
  not used on this page; what is used is only the definitions above and the
  characterisations of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

- **Interior and closure are dual.** Complementation exchanges the two families
  above, since $U$ is open exactly when $\mathbb{R} \setminus U$ is closed, so
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus A^{\circ} = \overline{\mathbb{R} \setminus A}$ and
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A} = (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)^{\circ} =
  \operatorname{ext} A$. The second identity is the reason the exterior is
  usually described as "the complement of the closure".

- **$A$ is open exactly when $A = A^{\circ}$, and closed exactly when
  $A = \overline{A}$.** For the first: $A^{\circ} \subseteq A$ always, and
  $A \subseteq A^{\circ}$ holds exactly when $A$ is one of the open subsets of
  $A$, that is, exactly when $A$ is open. The closure half is the same argument
  read the other way, and it is recorded as a claim of
  [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] because the rest of that theorem needs it.

- **Boundary points may or may not belong to the set.** $\partial (0,1) =
  \partial [0,1] = \{0,1\}$, and the two boundary points lie outside the first
  set and inside the second; the boundary sees only the way the set meets its
  complement, not which side the edge is assigned to.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]] and closure as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]].

- $x$ is an **adherent point** of $A$ when $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne
  \varnothing$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$.
- $x$ is a **limit point** (or *accumulation point*) of $A$ when
  $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every real
  $\varepsilon > 0$: every punctured neighbourhood of $x$ meets $A$.
- $x$ is an **isolated point** of $A$ when $x \in A$ and there is a real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$.
- The **derived set** of $A$ is
  $$A' \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \text{ is a limit point of } A \,\}.$$
- $A$ is **dense in $\mathbb{R}$** when $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$.

**A limit point is an adherent point**, since $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq
N_\varepsilon(x)$; and an element of $A$ is an adherent point of $A$, since
$x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). So the adherent
points of $A$ are exactly the points of $A \cup A'$, a statement proved as part
of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

**Limit point and isolated point are exact opposites inside $A$.** For
$x \in A$: $x$ is an isolated point of $A$ exactly when it is not a limit point
of $A$. Indeed $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$ says precisely that
$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, because $x$ itself always lies in
$N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ when $x \in A$; so the existence of an $\varepsilon$
witnessing isolation is the negation of the condition defining a limit point.
A point of $A$ is therefore either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$, and
never both.

**A limit point need not belong to the set, and a point of the set need not be a
limit point.** Both possibilities occur, and the two examples that matter later
are $0$, which is a limit point of $\{\, 1/k : k \ge 1 \,\}$ without belonging
to it, and $0$ again, which belongs to $\{0\} \cup [1,2]$ as an isolated point.

## Remarks

- **Terminology: *limit point* here is about a set, never about a sequence.**
  This library reserves *subsequential limit* for the sequential notion
  ([[def-subsequential-limit]]), and the two are genuinely different: the
  constant sequence $x_k = 0$ has $0$ as a subsequential limit, while its set of
  values $\{0\}$ has no limit point at all. The distinction is the one
  [[def-subsequential-limit]] records under "Terminology", and it is respected
  throughout this page.

- **Density is defined through the closure, not through intervals.** Saying
  $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$ is equivalent to saying that every nonempty open
  subset of $\mathbb{R}$ meets $A$, and also to saying that every neighbourhood
  of every real meets $A$; the equivalences follow from
  [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] and are used in that form in
  [[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]].

- **The derived set need not be comparable with the set.** It can be strictly
  larger, as for $\mathbb{Q}$: every punctured neighbourhood of any real
  contains a rational, since density supplies one strictly between $x$ and
  $x + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]), so the derived set of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is all of $\mathbb{R}$. It can be strictly smaller, as for
  $\{0\}$, whose derived set is empty; and it can be neither, as for
  $\{0\} \cup (1,2)$, whose derived set is $[1,2]$, a set containing points
  outside the original and omitting the point $0$ of it. A closed set satisfying
  $A \subseteq A'$ is called perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]).

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), intervals and their lengths are as in
[[def-interval]], and a *sequence* is a function on $\mathbb{N}$, which contains
$0$. Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

- $A$ has **measure zero**, equivalently $A$ is **null**, when for every real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ there are sequences $(a_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ and
  $(b_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of reals with $a_k \le b_k$ for every $k$, such
  that
  $$A \subseteq \bigcup_{k \in \mathbb{N}} [a_k, b_k] \qquad \text{and} \qquad \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (b_k - a_k) \text{ converges with sum } \le \varepsilon .$$
- $A$ has **content zero** when for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there are
  $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and reals $a_0 \le b_0, \dots, a_n \le b_n$ with
  $$A \subseteq \bigcup_{j \le n} [a_j, b_j] \qquad \text{and} \qquad \sum_{j=0}^{n} (b_j - a_j) \le \varepsilon .$$

The number $b_k - a_k \ge 0$ is the length of $[a_k,b_k]$ ([[def-interval]]), and
the sums are the series and the finite sums of [[def-series]] and
[[def-finite-sum]].

**Working form: only the partial sums have to be checked.** All the terms
$b_k - a_k$ are $\ge 0$, so by claim 2 of
[[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]] the series converges exactly when
its partial sums are bounded above, and its sum is then their supremum.
Consequently, for a fixed $\varepsilon > 0$,

$$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(b_k - a_k) \text{ converges with sum} \le \varepsilon \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \sum_{k<n} (b_k - a_k) \le \varepsilon \ \text{ for every } n \in \mathbb{N},$$

since a supremum is $\le \varepsilon$ exactly when $\varepsilon$ is an upper
bound of the set it is the supremum of ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]). Every
verification of nullity below checks the right-hand condition.

**Closed intervals lose nothing.** A bounded interval with endpoints
$a \le b$ is contained in $[a,b]$ and has the same length ([[def-interval]]), so
a cover by intervals of any of the four bounded forms yields a cover by closed
intervals with the same lengths. The definition is therefore stated with closed
intervals once and for all. Covers by *open* intervals are a genuinely different
demand, and passing to one costs a little extra length: the enlargement
$[a_k,b_k] \subseteq (a_k - \delta_k,\ b_k + \delta_k)$ is carried out where it is
needed, in [[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]] and in
[[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]].

**Both notions are inherited by subsets.** If $B \subseteq A$ and $A$ is null,
then any cover of $A$ covers $B$, so $B$ is null; the same sentence with finite
covers shows a subset of a set of content zero has content zero.

**A finite cover is a countable cover, so content zero implies measure zero.**
Padding the list $[a_0,b_0], \dots, [a_n,b_n]$ with the degenerate intervals
$[0,0]$ for $k > n$ leaves the total length unchanged, by the splitting law for
finite sums ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]). This is recorded as a lemma with its
proof, [[lem-content-zero-implies-null]], because it is cited on its own.

## Remarks

- **The two notions genuinely differ.** $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$ is null and does
  not have content zero ([[cex-null-set-not-of-content-zero]]), so the two
  quantifier patterns, "a sequence of intervals" and "a finite list of
  intervals", are not interchangeable. They do agree for compact sets
  ([[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]]), and the compact case is the only one in
  which content zero is used anywhere on this pair of pages. Nothing is claimed
  about what later pages will do with it.

- **Why "content" and not "measure" for the finite version.** The finite-cover
  notion is the vanishing of the Jordan outer content, and the countable-cover
  notion is the vanishing of the Lebesgue outer measure. Neither outer quantity
  is defined in this library, and no item here assigns a nonzero size to any set:
  every statement is of the shape "can, or cannot, be covered by intervals of
  total length below such and such a bound". That is a deliberate restriction of
  scope at this point in the reading order, not a claim that the general notions
  are unavailable in mathematics.

- **Measure zero is not vacuous and not universal.** No interval with two
  distinct endpoints is null ([[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]]), while
  every at most countable set is ([[lem-countable-sets-are-null]]) and so is the
  uncountable Cantor set ([[thm-cantor-set-properties]]). The three facts
  together are what make the notion worth having.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with interior $A^{\circ}$ and closure
$\overline{A}$ as in [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]].

- $A$ is **nowhere dense** when the interior of its closure is empty:
  $$\big(\overline{A}\big)^{\circ} \;=\; \varnothing .$$
- $A$ is **meager**, or **of the first category**, when there is a sequence
  $(A_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of nowhere dense subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ with
  $$A \;=\; \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n .$$
- $A$ is **of the second category** when it is not meager.
- $A$ is **residual** (also *comeager*) when $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ is meager.

**Why a sequence, and why that is the same as "an at most countable union".**
Sequences here are indexed by $\mathbb{N}$, which contains $0$. A finite family
$A_0, \dots, A_m$ of nowhere dense sets is turned into a sequence by setting
$A_n := \varnothing$ for $n > m$, and $\varnothing$ is nowhere dense because
$\overline{\varnothing} = \varnothing$ has empty interior; the empty family is
handled the same way and gives $A = \varnothing$. So "a union of an at most
countable family of nowhere dense sets" ([[def-countable]]) and the displayed
condition define the same class, and the sequence form is used below because it
carries an explicit index and needs no case split.

**Nowhere dense means exactly that the complement of the closure is dense.**
For $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$,

$$\big(\overline{A}\big)^{\circ} = \varnothing \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A} \text{ is dense in } \mathbb{R} .$$

Indeed, by the pointwise description of the interior
([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]), $(\overline{A})^{\circ} = \varnothing$
says that no $x \in \mathbb{R}$ admits a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with
$N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq \overline{A}$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), that is,
that every $N_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $\mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A}$. By
claim 1 of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] that says precisely that every
$x \in \mathbb{R}$ is adherent to $\mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A}$, that is,
$\overline{\mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A}} = \mathbb{R}$, which is density
([[def-limit-point-r]]).

**A closed set is nowhere dense exactly when its interior is empty**, since a
closed set equals its own closure (claim 4 of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]],
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]). This is the form in which nowhere density is
verified nearly every time below. (The phrase *almost everywhere* is avoided
throughout this pair: it is a measure-theoretic term, and the only measure notion
defined here is measure zero.)

**Both classes are closed downwards.** If $B \subseteq A$ then
$\overline{B} \subseteq \overline{A}$ and hence
$(\overline{B})^{\circ} \subseteq (\overline{A})^{\circ}$
([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]), so a subset of a nowhere dense set is
nowhere dense. If $B \subseteq A = \bigcup_n A_n$ with each $A_n$ nowhere dense,
then $B = \bigcup_n (A_n \cap B)$ and each $A_n \cap B$ is nowhere dense by the
previous sentence, so a subset of a meager set is meager.

**A union of two meager sets is meager.** Let $M = \bigcup_n A_n$ and
$M' = \bigcup_n B_n$ with all $A_n$ and all $B_n$ nowhere dense; fixing one
witnessing sequence for $M$ and one for $M'$ is two instantiations of an
existential statement, not a choice principle. Let
$J : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ be a bijection
([[thm-n-cross-n-countable]]) and define a sequence $(C_j)_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ by

$$C_{J(m,n)} \;:=\; \begin{cases} A_n & m = 0, \\ B_n & m \ne 0. \end{cases}$$

This is a total definition because $J$ is a bijection, every $C_j$ is nowhere
dense, and $\bigcup_j C_j = M \cup M'$, since $A_n = C_{J(0,n)}$ and
$B_n = C_{J(1,n)}$ and every $C_j$ is one of the $A_n$ or one of the $B_n$.

## Remarks

- **The countably infinite version of the last observation is a different
  statement.** To show that $\bigcup_i M_i$ is meager for a sequence $(M_i)$ of
  meager sets one must select a witnessing sequence of nowhere dense sets for
  every $i$ at once, which is an application of countable choice
  ([[def-countable-choice]]); the two-set case above avoids it because two
  selections are two instantiations. Nothing on this page uses the countably
  infinite version, and every meager set met below is presented together with an
  explicit witnessing sequence.

- **Nowhere dense is strictly stronger than having empty interior.**
  $\mathbb{Q}$ has empty interior, since no neighbourhood consists of rationals
  alone, yet $\overline{\mathbb{Q}} = \mathbb{R}$ has interior $\mathbb{R}$, so
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is not nowhere dense. It is nevertheless meager, being a union of
  singletons; that computation is [[cor-q-is-meager-and-not-g-delta]].

- **First category, second category and residual are not a trichotomy.** A set
  is meager or of the second category, and those two are exhaustive and
  exclusive by definition. Residual is a separate condition on the complement: a
  residual set is of the second category once $\mathbb{R}$ is known not to be
  meager in itself ([[thm-baire-category-r]]), but before that theorem nothing
  rules out a set that is both meager and residual.

- **Category is a notion of topological smallness, and it is independent of
  smallness in the sense of measure.** Neither of the two implications between
  "nowhere dense" and "measure zero" ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]])
  holds, and $\mathbb{R}$ itself splits into a meager set and a set of measure
  zero; the three items settling this are
  [[fs-nowhere-dense-implies-measure-zero]],
  [[fs-measure-zero-implies-nowhere-dense]] and
  [[cex-meager-set-of-full-measure]].

## Definition

Let $U, F \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]].

- $U$ is **open** when for every $x \in U$ there is a real $\varepsilon > 0$
  with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$.
- $F$ is **closed** when its complement $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open.
- A set is **clopen** when it is both open and closed.

The whole of the topology of $\mathbb{R}$ developed on this page rests on this
one definition: closedness is *defined* as openness of the complement, and every
other description of a closed set on this page is a theorem
([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]]).

**$\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen.** The condition defining openness
quantifies over the elements of the set, so it holds vacuously for
$\varnothing$; and for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ one has $N_1(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$,
so $\mathbb{R}$ is open. Since each of the two is the complement of the other,
each is also closed.

**Every neighbourhood is open.** Let $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and put
$\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x|$, which is $> 0$ because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$. The nesting property of [[def-neighbourhood-r]] gives
$N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$. So every point of $N_\varepsilon(x)$
has a neighbourhood inside it.

**The four open forms of [[def-interval]] are open sets.** Let $a, b \in
\mathbb{R}$.

- $(a,b)$: for $x$ with $a < x < b$, both $x - a > 0$ and $b - x > 0$, so
  $\delta := \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ is a positive real (the minimum of a
  two-element set of reals exists, [[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).
  If $|y - x| < \delta$ then $y > x - \delta \ge x - (x - a) = a$ and
  $y < x + \delta \le x + (b - x) = b$, so $y \in (a,b)$; hence
  $N_\delta(x) \subseteq (a,b)$.
- $(a,\infty)$: for $x > a$ take $\delta := x - a > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y > x - \delta = a$.
- $(-\infty,b)$: for $x < b$ take $\delta := b - x > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y < x + \delta = b$.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: already treated above.

**The four closed forms of [[def-interval]] are closed sets.** In each case the
complement is shown open directly.

- $[a,b]$: if $x \notin [a,b]$ then $x < a$ or $x > b$ by trichotomy
  ([[def-ordered-field]]). If $x < a$, take $\delta := a - x > 0$; every
  $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has $y < x + \delta = a$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. If
  $x > b$, take $\delta := x - b > 0$; every $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has
  $y > x - \delta = b$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. So
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus [a,b]$ is open.
- $[a,\infty)$: its complement is $(-\infty,a)$, which is open by the previous
  paragraph.
- $(-\infty,b]$: its complement is $(b,\infty)$, which is open.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: its complement is $\varnothing$, which is
  open.

## Remarks

- **Open and closed are not opposites, and not exhaustive.** A set may be
  neither: the half-open interval $[0,1)$ is neither open nor closed
  ([[fs-every-set-is-open-or-closed]]). A set may be both: $\varnothing$ and
  $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen. The words are inherited from the interval terminology
  of [[def-interval]], and the agreement between the two usages is exactly the
  two lists verified above: an interval called open there is an open set here,
  and an interval called closed there is a closed set here.

- **A clopen set is a disconnection waiting to happen.** If $A$ is clopen and
  both $A$ and $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ are nonempty, then each of the two is
  its own closure, so the two are separated in the sense of
  [[def-connected-r]] and $\mathbb{R} = A \cup (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)$ is a
  disconnection. Since $\mathbb{R}$ is order-convex it is connected
  ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]]), so no such $A$ exists:
  $\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are the only clopen subsets of $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The half-open forms are the ones the two lists omit**, and deliberately so:
  $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ with $a < b$ are neither open nor closed as subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The radius depends on the point.** Openness asks for *some* $\varepsilon$
  at each point, and that $\varepsilon$ may shrink to nothing as the point
  approaches the edge of the set, as the computation for $(a,b)$ shows: there
  $\delta = \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ tends to $0$ as $x$ tends to either endpoint.
  Asking instead for a single $\varepsilon$ that works simultaneously at every
  point of the set is a strictly stronger condition, and it is not what is
  defined here; nothing on this page uses it.

## Statement

**False claim:** every nowhere dense subset of $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]]) has measure zero
([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

The claim is tempting because a nowhere dense set is topologically thin: its
closure contains no interval at all, so it is "full of holes" everywhere. The
error is to read that as a statement about total length. Holes may be plentiful
and short at the same time, and the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set is built precisely
so that they are.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The Smith-Volterra-Cantor set $S$ of [[def-fat-cantor-set]].

[A1] The false claim: every nowhere dense subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has measure zero.

[L1] $S$ is nowhere dense ([[thm-fat-cantor-set-has-positive-measure]], claim 3).

[L2] If sequences $(a_k)$, $(b_k)$ with $a_k \le b_k$ cover $S$ and all their partial total lengths are at most $M$, then $M \ge 2^{-1}$; in particular $S$ does not have measure zero ([[thm-fat-cantor-set-has-positive-measure]], claim 4).

[L3] A set is null when for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ it has a cover by a sequence of closed intervals with all partial total lengths at most $\varepsilon$ ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The set $S$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ and is nowhere dense, by [L1]. [L1]

1.2 $S$ does not have measure zero: a cover witnessing nullity at $\varepsilon := 4^{-1}$ would have all partial total lengths at most $4^{-1}$, and [L2] then forces $4^{-1} \ge 2^{-1}$, which is false. [L2, L3]

2.1 So $S$ is a nowhere dense subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that does not have measure zero, and the claim [A1] fails at $S$; the claim is therefore false. [step 1.1, step 1.2, A1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The converse implication is also false**, and for a completely different
  reason: $\mathbb{Q}$ has measure zero and is not nowhere dense
  ([[fs-measure-zero-implies-nowhere-dense]]). So neither of the two notions of
  smallness implies the other, and the two failures are witnessed by sets of
  different cardinality, $S$ being uncountable and $\mathbb{Q}$ countable.

- **What is true.** A nowhere dense set contains no interval of positive length,

## Statement

Every at most countable set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-countable]]) has
measure zero ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

The cover is explicit: the $k$-th point of a listing of $A$ is put inside an
interval of length $\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-k-1}$, and the lengths sum to
$\varepsilon$ by [[thm-geometric-series]]. **No choice principle is used**: a
listing of $A$ is a single object, fixed once ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]]),
and everything after that is a formula in $k$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An at most countable set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a real $\varepsilon > 0$. Throughout, $\theta := 2^{-1}$.

[L1] $A$ is null when for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there are sequences $(a_k)$, $(b_k)$ with $a_k \le b_k$, $A \subseteq \bigcup_k [a_k,b_k]$, and $\sum_{k<n}(b_k - a_k) \le \varepsilon$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

[L2] $[c,d] = \{\, x : c \le x \le d \,\}$ has length $d - c$ when $c \le d$, and $[c,c] = \{c\}$ has length $0$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L3] A nonempty at most countable set admits a surjection $s : \mathbb{N} \to A$ ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]], [[def-countable]]).

[L4] Powers and the geometric series: $\theta^0 = 1$, $\theta^{k+1} = \theta^k\theta$, $\theta^k > 0$, and $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\theta^k = 2$ for $\theta = 2^{-1}$; a series of nonnegative terms has all its partial sums at most its sum ([[def-integer-power]], [[thm-geometric-series]], [[def-series]], [[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]]).

[L5] Finite sums: scaling by a constant, and $\sum_{k<n} 0 = 0$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L6] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 > 0$, $4 > 0$ and $t \cdot 4^{-1} > 0$ for $t > 0$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve an inequality ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let the real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. If $A = \varnothing$, the constant sequences $a_k := 0$ and $b_k := 0$ satisfy $A \subseteq \bigcup_k [0,0]$ vacuously and $\sum_{k<n}(b_k - a_k) = 0 \le \varepsilon$ for every $n$ by [L5], so the condition of [L1] holds at this $\varepsilon$. Assume from now on that $A \ne \varnothing$ and, by [L3], fix a surjection $s : \mathbb{N} \to A$. [given, L1, L2, L3, L5, choose]

2.1 Put $\delta_k := \varepsilon \cdot 4^{-1} \cdot \theta^{k}$, a positive real by [L4] and [L6], and $a_k := s(k) - \delta_k$, $b_k := s(k) + \delta_k$; then $a_k \le b_k$ and $s(k) \in [a_k,b_k]$ by [L6], so $A = \{\, s(k) : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\} \subseteq \bigcup_k [a_k, b_k]$ by step 1.1. The length of $[a_k,b_k]$ is $b_k - a_k = 2\delta_k = \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} \cdot \theta^{k}$ by [L2] and [L6]. [step 1.1, L2, L4, L6]

3.1 For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $\sum_{k<n}(b_k - a_k) = \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} \sum_{k<n}\theta^{k} \le \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} \cdot 2 = \varepsilon$, using scaling from [L5] and the bound on the partial sums of the geometric series from [L4]. [step 2.1, L4, L5, L6]

4.1 So for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the sequences of step 2.1 cover $A$ with all partial total lengths at most $\varepsilon$, which by [L1] is exactly the statement that $A$ has measure zero; the empty case was settled in step 1.1. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 3.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Indexing.** Sequences here start at $k = 0$, and the first interval has
  length $\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$, not $\varepsilon$. The total is
  $\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} \sum_{k \ge 0} 2^{-k} = \varepsilon$ exactly, so the
  cover is as tight as the definition allows and nothing is wasted at the first
  index.

- **Repetitions are harmless.** A surjection $s$ may repeat values, and a finite
  set is covered by infinitely many intervals, most of them redundant. This is
  why the listing form of countability ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]])
  is the convenient one: no injectivity and no case split between the finite and
  the countably infinite case is needed.

- **The converse fails badly.** The Cantor set is uncountable and null
  ([[thm-cantor-set-properties]]), so "null" is very far from "countable"; and
  the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set is uncountable and not null
  ([[thm-fat-cantor-set-has-positive-measure]]), so cardinality decides nothing
  either way.

- **Density decides nothing either.** $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable, hence null, and
  is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[cex-dense-set-of-measure-zero]]); a null set may
  therefore meet every interval.

## Statement

Write $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the image of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$
under the canonical embedding $q \mapsto \hat q$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), the
set usually written $\mathbb{Q}$ once the identification is made, and put
$X := \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the irrationals. Then:

1. $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$, that is,
   $\overline{\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}} = \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]);
2. $X$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$;
3. every nonempty open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable
   ([[def-countable]]).

Claim 2 is not a symmetry of claim 1: the rationals are dense because they are
*constructed* to approximate, whereas the irrationals are dense because there are
too many points in any interval for a countable set to exhaust it, which is why
claim 3 is proved alongside and used for it.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The canonical embedding $q \mapsto \hat q$ of $\mathbb{Q}$ into $\mathbb{R}$, its image $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, and the complement $X = \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$.

[L1] $\overline{A}$ is the set of points every neighbourhood of which meets $A$; $A$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ when $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L2] $N_\varepsilon(x) = (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon)$ for real $\varepsilon > 0$, and $x - \varepsilon < x + \varepsilon$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L3] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L4] Strictly between any two reals lies an element of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, and $q \mapsto \hat q$ is injective ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L5] $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-rationals-countable]]); an injection is a bijection onto its image, and $\approx$ is symmetric and transitive ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]], [[def-equinumerous]]).

[L6] Every subset of an at most countable set is at most countable, and uncountable means not at most countable ([[lem-subset-of-countable]], [[def-countable]]).

[L7] For $a < b$ the interval $(a,b)$ is uncountable ([[cor-interval-uncountable]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is dense: let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real; by [L2] one has $x - \varepsilon < x + \varepsilon$, so [L4] supplies $\hat q$ with $x - \varepsilon < \hat q < x + \varepsilon$, that is $\hat q \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$. Every real is therefore an adherent point of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and claim 1 follows from [L1]. [L1, L2, L4]

1.2 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is at most countable: the embedding is an injection of $\mathbb{Q}$ with image $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, hence a bijection onto it, so $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \approx \mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$. [L4, L5]

1.3 For all reals $a < b$ the interval $(a,b)$ is uncountable. [L7]

2.1 For all reals $a < b$ the interval $(a,b)$ contains an irrational: if it did not, then $(a,b) \subseteq \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, so $(a,b)$ would be a subset of an at most countable set by step 1.2 and hence at most countable by [L6], contradicting step 1.3. So some $z \in (a,b)$ lies in $X$. [step 1.2, step 1.3, L6]

2.2 Every nonempty open $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is uncountable: fix $x \in U$ and, by [L3], a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; by [L2] the set $N_\varepsilon(x)$ is the interval $(x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon)$ with $x - \varepsilon < x + \varepsilon$, hence uncountable by step 1.3. Were $U$ at most countable, its subset $N_\varepsilon(x)$ would be at most countable by [L6], which it is not; so $U$ is uncountable, which is claim 3. [step 1.3, L2, L3, L6, choose]

3.1 $X$ is dense: let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real; applying step 2.1 with $a = x - \varepsilon$ and $b = x + \varepsilon$ gives $z \in (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon) \cap X$, which is $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap X$ by [L2]. Every real is therefore an adherent point of $X$, so $\overline{X} = \mathbb{R}$ by [L1], which is claim 2. [step 2.1, L1, L2]

4.1 Claims 1, 2 and 3 are steps 1.1, 3.1 and 2.2, so both $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and its complement are dense in $\mathbb{R}$ and every nonempty open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable. [step 1.1, step 2.2, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Two dense sets can be disjoint.** $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and $X$ partition
  $\mathbb{R}$ and both are dense, so density says nothing about size: one of
  them is countable and the other is not
  ([[cor-irrationals-uncountable]]). What density does say is that neither has
  interior: a set whose complement is dense has empty interior, which is the
  computation carried out for $\mathbb{Q}$ in
  [[ex-closure-interior-boundary-of-q]].

- **Claim 3 is a statement about open sets, not about intervals.** It follows
  from the uncountability of intervals ([[cor-interval-uncountable]]) only
  because openness supplies an interval inside the set at each of its points.
  A nonempty set with empty interior can perfectly well be countable, as
  $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ shows.

- **An explicit irrational is not produced here.** Step 2.1 is a counting
  argument and exhibits nothing. The library does exhibit one separately,
  $\sqrt 2$ ([[thm-of-square-roots]], [[fs-sqrt2-rational]]), and an explicit
  irrational in a given interval $(a,b)$ can be built from it as
  $q_1 + (q_2 - q_1)/\sqrt 2$ for suitable rationals $q_1 < q_2$ in the
  interval; that route is longer and is not the one taken above.

## Statement

The map $q \mapsto \hat q$ ([[def-real-numbers]]) is an embedding of ordered
fields. Every real is approximated by rationals: for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and
rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ with
$|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$. Consequently, strictly between any two
reals lies a rational.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real $x = [(a_n)]$ and a rational $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] The orders of $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}$; ordered-field arithmetic ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Field arithmetic in $\mathbb{Q}$: $\varepsilon/2, \delta/4$ are positive rationals, and every nonzero rational $q$ has a reciprocal $1/q$ with $q \cdot (1/q) = 1$ ([[thm-rat-field]]).

[L3] Cauchy definition ([[def-rational-cauchy-sequence]]).

[L4] Real positivity via eventual rational lower bounds ([[def-real-order]]).

[L5] $\mathbb{R} = \mathcal{C}/\mathcal{N}$ is a field ([[thm-reals-field]]), and $0_{\mathbb{R}} = \hat 0$, $1_{\mathbb{R}} = \hat 1$ are the classes of the constant sequences ([[def-real-numbers]]). A multiplicative inverse there is unique: if $ab = 1_{\mathbb{R}} = ac$ then $b = b(ac) = (ba)c = c$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Embedding: constant sequences are Cauchy; $\hat q = \hat r$ iff the constant $q - r$ is null iff $q = r$; operations match termwise; and $q < r$ gives the constant lower bound $r - q > 0$, so $\hat q < \hat r$ and order is preserved and reflected. [L1, L4]

1.2 Fix $N$ with $|a_m - a_n| < \varepsilon/2$ for all $m, n \ge N$, and set $q = a_N$. [L3, L2]

2.1 The difference $\hat q - x$ has representative $(a_N - a_n)$ with $|a_N - a_n| < \varepsilon/2$ for $n \ge N$; hence both $\hat\varepsilon - (x - \hat q)$ and $\hat\varepsilon - (\hat q - x)$ have representatives eventually $> \varepsilon/2$, so both are positive: $|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$. [step 1.2, L4, L1]

2.2 Inverses: let $q$ be a nonzero rational. Then $\hat q \ne \hat 0 = 0_{\mathbb{R}}$ by the injectivity of step 1.1, and $1/q$ exists in $\mathbb{Q}$ by [L2]; since the operations match termwise (step 1.1), $\hat q \cdot \widehat{1/q} = \widehat{q \cdot (1/q)} = \hat 1 = 1_{\mathbb{R}}$. Inverses in $\mathbb{R}$ are unique by [L5], so $(\hat q)^{-1} = \widehat{1/q}$: the embedding preserves reciprocals. [step 1.1, L2, L5]

3.1 Density: let $x < y$; pick $\delta > 0$ rational and $N$ with the representative of $y - x$ eventually $> \delta$; set $\varepsilon = \delta/4$ and pick $q$ with $|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$; then $q' = q + 2\varepsilon$ satisfies $\hat q' - x \ge -\hat\varepsilon + 2\hat\varepsilon = \hat\varepsilon > 0$ and $y - \hat q' \ge \hat\delta - \hat\varepsilon - 2\hat\varepsilon = \hat\delta/4 > 0$, so $x < \hat q' < y$. [step 2.1, L4, L1, L2]

4.1 The rationals embed as an ordered subfield — injectively, preserving the order in both directions, the ring operations, and reciprocals — and they approximate every real arbitrarily well and separate any two reals. [step 1.1, step 2.2, step 3.1] ∎

## Statement

$\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-equinumerous]]): the rationals are
countably infinite ([[def-countable]]).

**No choice principle is used.** The one place where a reader expects a choice,
"pick a representative $a/b$ of each rational", is exactly where
[[lem-rat-positive-denominator]] applies: every rational *has* a representative
with positive denominator, so the map $(a,b) \mapsto [(a,b)]$ defined on
$\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ is already **surjective** onto $\mathbb{Q}$,
and countability follows from a surjection without ever selecting a
representative. The same device handles $\mathbb{Z}$, which is a surjective image
of $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ by construction ([[def-integers]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $\mathbb{Z} = (\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N})/\sim$ with quotient map $(a,b) \mapsto [(a,b)]$ ([[def-integers]]), and $\mathbb{Q}$ the set of classes $[(a,b)]$ of pairs of integers with $b \ne 0$ ([[def-rationals]]). Write $\mathbb{Z}_{>0} = \{\, b \in \mathbb{Z} : b > 0 \,\}$ ([[def-int-order]]).

[L1] Finite, countably infinite, at most countable, uncountable ([[def-countable]]).

[L2] Bijections, injections, surjections, composition; $\approx$ and $\preceq$ ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]], [[def-equinumerous]]).

[L3] A nonempty $X$ is at most countable iff there is a surjection $\mathbb{N} \to X$; and from such a surjection $s$ the map $x \mapsto \min\{\, k : s(k) = x \,\}$ is an injection $X \to \mathbb{N}$ ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]]).

[L4] There is a bijection $\beta : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-n-cross-n-countable]]).

[L5] A product of two at most countable sets is at most countable ([[thm-product-of-countable]]); a subset of an at most countable set is at most countable ([[lem-subset-of-countable]]).

[L6] Every rational is $[(a,b)]$ for some integers $a$ and $b$ with $b > 0$ ([[lem-rat-positive-denominator]]).

[L7] $\mathbb{N}$ embeds injectively in $\mathbb{Z}$ by $n \mapsto [(n,0)]$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]) and $\mathbb{Z}$ embeds injectively in $\mathbb{Q}$ by $k \mapsto [(k,1)]$ ([[lem-int-embeds-rat]]).

[L8] $\preceq$ in both directions gives $\approx$ ([[thm-schroder-bernstein]]).

[L9] The relation of [[def-int-order]] is a total order on $\mathbb{Z}$ compatible with the ring structure ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), and $\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \ne \varnothing$: on representatives $0 < [(a,b)]$ holds exactly when $b < a$ in $\mathbb{N}$ ([[def-int-order]]), and $0 < 1$ in $\mathbb{N}$, since $1 = \sigma(0) \ne 0$ ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]) while $0 < n$ for every nonzero natural $n$ (claim 4 of [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]); so the integer $[(1,0)]$ is positive.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The quotient map $\pi : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$, $\pi(a,b) = [(a,b)]$, is surjective, since every integer is by definition such a class; hence $\pi \circ \beta : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ is a surjection, and $\mathbb{Z} \ne \varnothing$, so $\mathbb{Z}$ is at most countable by [L3]. [given, L2, L3, L4]

1.2 The composite $\iota : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$, $n \mapsto [([(n,0)],1)]$, of the two embeddings of [L7] is injective, so $\mathbb{N} \preceq \mathbb{Q}$. [L2, L7]

2.1 $\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ is a subset of $\mathbb{Z}$, hence at most countable by [L5], and it is nonempty by [L9]; therefore $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ is at most countable by [L5] and nonempty, so [L3] provides a surjection $u : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$. [step 1.1, L3, L5, L9]

3.1 The map $\rho : \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_{>0} \to \mathbb{Q}$, $\rho(a,b) = [(a,b)]$, is well defined because $b > 0$ gives $b \ne 0$, and it is surjective by [L6]; hence $\rho \circ u : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$ is a surjection, $\mathbb{Q}$ is at most countable, and [L3] turns that surjection into an injection $j : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{N}$, so $\mathbb{Q} \preceq \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.1, given, L2, L3, L6]

4.1 From $\mathbb{N} \preceq \mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{Q} \preceq \mathbb{N}$, the Schröder-Bernstein theorem [L8] yields a bijection $\mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{N}$; hence $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ is countably infinite. [step 1.2, step 3.1, L1, L8] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why Schröder-Bernstein rather than a count.** The usual last line is "countable, and infinite because $\mathbb{N}$ injects into it". Turning that into a proof requires knowing that a set containing an injective copy of $\mathbb{N}$ is not finite, which is the pigeonhole principle, [[lem-pigeonhole]], proved earlier on this page. That route is now available, but it is a detour: [[thm-schroder-bernstein]] gets the bijection directly from the two injections already in hand, and it is choice free, so nothing is lost.

- **Lowest terms are not needed and are not available.** A frequent presentation injects $\mathbb{Q}$ into $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{N}$ by sending each rational to its representative in lowest terms. That map needs greatest common divisors, which this library has not developed. Working with a surjection instead of an injection avoids the issue entirely: repetitions in an enumeration are harmless ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]]).

- The proof shows in passing that $\mathbb{Z} \approx \mathbb{N}$, by the same two-injection argument applied to [L7] and step 1.1, and that $\mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{Q}^3$ and so on are countable ([[thm-product-of-countable]]). The contrast with [[thm-r-uncountable]] is the point of the page: adding all limits of rational approximations to $\mathbb{Q}$ changes the size of the set, not merely its arithmetic.
