## Example

By [[thm-cantor-set-ternary-description]] a real $x$ lies in the Cantor set $C$
exactly when

$$x \;=\; \Phi(a) \;=\; \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k 3^{-k-1} \qquad \text{for some sequence } a \text{ with every } a_k \in \{0,2\},$$

and that sequence is then unique. The membership test is therefore: *$x$ has a
ternary expansion using only the digits $0$ and $2$.* Six points are worked out
here.

| $x$ | digit sequence $\Phi^{-1}(x)$ |
|---|---|
| $0$ | $0,0,0,0,\dots$ |
| $1$ | $2,2,2,2,\dots$ |
| $1/3$ | $0,2,2,2,\dots$ |
| $2/3$ | $2,0,0,0,\dots$ |
| $1/9$ | $0,0,2,2,2,\dots$ |
| $1/4$ | $0,2,0,2,0,2,\dots$ |

The last line is the interesting one: the digits of $1/4$ alternate for ever, so
$1/4$ lies in $C$ without being an endpoint of any interval removed in the
construction ([[cex-cantor-point-that-is-not-an-endpoint]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The Cantor set $C$, the set $D$ of $\{0,2\}$-valued sequences and the bijection $\Phi : D \to C$ of [[thm-cantor-set-ternary-description]]. Write $\sigma a$ for the shifted sequence $(\sigma a)_k = a_{k+1}$.

[L1] $\Phi$ is a bijection from $D$ onto $C$ with $\Phi(a) = \sum_{k \ge 0} a_k 3^{-k-1}$, and the series converges for every $a \in D$ ([[thm-cantor-set-ternary-description]], [[def-series]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L2] $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} r^{k} = 1/(1-r)$ for $|r| < 1$; in particular $\sum_{k \ge 0} 3^{-k} = 3 \cdot 2^{-1}$ and hence $\sum_{k \ge m} 2 \cdot 3^{-k-1} = 3^{-m}$; convergent series add and scale termwise, and the tail of a convergent series is again convergent with $\sum_{k \ge 0} t_k = t_0 + \sum_{k \ge 1} t_k$ ([[thm-geometric-series]], [[lem-series-linearity]], [[def-series]], [[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]], [[def-integer-power]], [[lem-power-laws]]).

[L4] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $3 > 0$, $3^{-1} > 0$, $8 > 0$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve an inequality; the order is total and transitive ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Verification

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **The shift identity.** For $a \in D$, $\Phi(a) = a_0 \cdot 3^{-1} + 3^{-1}\Phi(\sigma a)$: by [L2] the series splits as $\Phi(a) = a_0 3^{-1} + \sum_{k \ge 1} a_k 3^{-k-1}$, and $\sum_{k \ge 1}a_k 3^{-k-1} = \sum_{j \ge 0} a_{j+1} 3^{-j-2} = 3^{-1}\sum_{j \ge 0}a_{j+1}3^{-j-1} = 3^{-1}\Phi(\sigma a)$ by [L2] and [L4]. [given, L1, L2, L4]

1.2 **The constant and eventually constant sequences.** By [L2], $\Phi(0,0,0,\dots) = 0$ and $\Phi(2,2,2,\dots) = \sum_{k \ge 0}2 \cdot 3^{-k-1} = 3^{0} = 1$. Likewise $\Phi(0,2,2,2,\dots) = 0 + \sum_{k \ge 1}2\cdot3^{-k-1} = 3^{-1} = 1/3$, $\Phi(2,0,0,\dots) = 2 \cdot 3^{-1} = 2/3$, and $\Phi(0,0,2,2,2,\dots) = \sum_{k \ge 2}2 \cdot 3^{-k-1} = 3^{-2} = 1/9$. [L1, L2]

2.1 **The alternating sequence gives $1/4$.** Let $a$ be the sequence with $a_k = 0$ for even $k$ and $a_k = 2$ for odd $k$, so $a \in D$ and $\sigma(\sigma a) = a$. Applying step 1.1 twice, $\Phi(a) = 0 \cdot 3^{-1} + 3^{-1}\Phi(\sigma a)$ and $\Phi(\sigma a) = 2 \cdot 3^{-1} + 3^{-1}\Phi(a)$, so $\Phi(a) = 3^{-1}\big(2 \cdot 3^{-1} + 3^{-1}\Phi(a)\big) = 2 \cdot 9^{-1} + 9^{-1}\Phi(a)$; hence $(1 - 9^{-1})\Phi(a) = 2 \cdot 9^{-1}$, that is $8 \cdot 9^{-1}\Phi(a) = 2 \cdot 9^{-1}$ and $\Phi(a) = 2 \cdot 8^{-1} = 1/4$, by [L4]. [step 1.1, L4]

3.1 So all six points of the table lie in $C$ by [L1], with the digit sequences shown, and the sequences are the only ones representing them because $\Phi$ is injective by [L1]. The point $1/4$ has a digit sequence that is not eventually constant, since it takes both values $0$ and $2$ at arbitrarily large indices. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The digit $1$ is what the test forbids.** $1/3$ has the ternary expansion $0.1000\dots$ as well as $0.0222\dots$, and it is the second that witnesses $1/3 \in C$; the test asks for the *existence* of an expansion with digits in $\{0,2\}$, not for every expansion to have that form. By contrast $1/2$ is not in $C$ at all, since $C \subseteq C_1 = [0,\tfrac13] \cup [\tfrac23,1]$ ([[def-cantor-set]]) while $\tfrac13 < \tfrac12 < \tfrac23$.

- **The construction and the digits match stage by stage.** $C_1$ keeps the points whose first digit can be taken $0$ or $2$, $C_2$ those whose first two digits can be, and so on; that correspondence is the content of [[thm-cantor-set-ternary-description]] and is what makes the table computable without ever drawing the intervals.

- **$1/4$ is not special.** Every point of $C$ whose digit sequence is not eventually constant fails to be an endpoint, and those points are the vast majority: the eventually constant sequences are at most countable while $C$ is not ([[thm-cantor-set-properties]]).

## Statement refuted

**Refuted claim:** the Cantor set $C$ consists of the endpoints of the removed
intervals and is therefore at most countable
([[fs-cantor-set-countable]]).

The witness is $x_0 := 1/4$. It lies in $C$, its ternary digit sequence being the
alternating sequence $(0,2,0,2,\dots)$ ([[ex-cantor-set-in-ternary]]), and it is
the endpoint of no interval removed in the construction. Here, as everywhere on
this page, *$u$ is an endpoint of a removed interval* means that $u \in C$ and
there is $v \ne u$ with the open interval between $u$ and $v$ disjoint from $C$;
that is exactly what "the interval between them was removed" says in the
vocabulary available. What is shown below is that $C$ meets every interval
$(x_0, x_0 + \delta)$ and every interval $(x_0 - \delta, x_0)$, for every real
$\delta > 0$, so no such $v$ exists on either side.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The Cantor set $C$, the set $D$ of $\{0,2\}$-valued sequences and the bijection $\Phi : D \to C$ of [[thm-cantor-set-ternary-description]]; the alternating sequence $a \in D$, with $a_j = 0$ for even $j$ and $a_j = 2$ for odd $j$; and $x_0 := \Phi(a)$.

[A1] The refuted claim: every point of $C$ is an endpoint of a removed interval, so $C$ is at most countable.

[L1] $\Phi$ is a bijection from $D$ onto $C$ with $\Phi(b) = \sum_{j \ge 0}b_j 3^{-j-1}$, and $x_0 = \Phi(a) = 1/4$ ([[thm-cantor-set-ternary-description]], [[ex-cantor-set-in-ternary]], [[def-cantor-set]]).

[L2] Geometric tails: $\sum_{j \ge m}2 \cdot 3^{-j-1} = 3^{-m}$; a series of nonnegative terms has nonnegative sum and all partial sums at most the sum; convergent series add and scale termwise; and a series splits as $\sum_{j \ge 0} t_j = \sum_{j<m} t_j + \sum_{j \ge m} t_j$ ([[thm-geometric-series]], [[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]], [[lem-series-linearity]], [[def-series]], [[def-integer-power]], [[lem-power-laws]]).

[L3] $3^{-n} \to 0$, and convergence to $0$ is tested against rational $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[lem-geometric-sequence-null]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L4] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $3 > 0$ and $3^{-1} > 0$ and $2 \cdot 3^{-1} < 1$; $3^{-p} \le 3^{-q}$ whenever $q \le p$, by induction from $0 < 3^{-1} < 1$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve an inequality ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-interval]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L1] the point $x_0 = 1/4$ lies in $C$ and has digit sequence $a$, with $a_{2m} = 0$ and $a_{2m+1} = 2$ for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$. By [L2], for every $m$ one may split $\Phi(a) = \sum_{j<2m}a_j3^{-j-1} + \sum_{j \ge 2m}a_j3^{-j-1}$, and every tail $\sum_{j \ge p}a_j3^{-j-1}$ lies between $0$ and $3^{-p}$. [given, L1, L2]

2.1 **Points of $C$ immediately above $x_0$.** For $m \in \mathbb{N}$ let $b \in D$ agree with $a$ at every index $< 2m$, have $b_{2m} = 2$, and have $b_j = 0$ for $j > 2m$. Writing $P := \sum_{j<2m}a_j3^{-j-1}$, step 1.1 and [L2] give $\Phi(b) = P + 2 \cdot 3^{-2m-1}$ and $\Phi(a) = P + 0 + T$ with $0 \le T \le 3^{-2m-1}$, so $\Phi(b) - x_0 = 2 \cdot 3^{-2m-1} - T$ lies between $3^{-2m-1}$ and $2 \cdot 3^{-2m-1}$; in particular $\Phi(b) > x_0$ and $\Phi(b) - x_0 \le 2 \cdot 3^{-2m-1} < 3^{-2m} \le 3^{-m}$ by [L4]. And $\Phi(b) \in C$ by [L1]. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L4]

2.2 **Points of $C$ immediately below $x_0$.** For $m \in \mathbb{N}$ let $d \in D$ agree with $a$ at every index $< 2m+1$, have $d_{2m+1} = 0$, and have $d_j = 2$ for $j > 2m+1$. Writing $Q := \sum_{j<2m+1}a_j3^{-j-1}$, step 1.1 and [L2] give $\Phi(d) = Q + 0 + 3^{-2m-2}$ and $\Phi(a) = Q + 2 \cdot 3^{-2m-2} + T'$ with $0 \le T' \le 3^{-2m-2}$, so $x_0 - \Phi(d) = 3^{-2m-2} + T'$ lies between $3^{-2m-2}$ and $2 \cdot 3^{-2m-2}$; in particular $\Phi(d) < x_0$ and $x_0 - \Phi(d) < 3^{-2m-1} \le 3^{-m}$ by [L4]. And $\Phi(d) \in C$ by [L1]. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L4]

3.1 Let the real $\delta > 0$ be given; by [L3] fix $m$ with $3^{-m} < \delta$. Steps 2.1 and 2.2 then produce points of $C$ in $(x_0,\ x_0 + \delta)$ and in $(x_0 - \delta,\ x_0)$. Consequently, for every $v > x_0$ the interval $(x_0, v)$ meets $C$, and for every $u < x_0$ the interval $(u, x_0)$ meets $C$; so there is no $v \ne x_0$ with the open interval between $x_0$ and $v$ disjoint from $C$, and $x_0$ is the endpoint of no removed interval. Since $x_0 \in C$, the claim [A1] fails at $x_0$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, A1, L1, L3, L4] ∎

## Remarks

- **The digits diagnose it.** By the argument of
  [[thm-cantor-function-properties]] the two endpoints of a gap have digit
  sequences that are eventually $2$ and eventually $0$ respectively; the digits of
  $1/4$ alternate for ever, so it can be neither. The proof above avoids that
  route and exhibits the approximating points directly, which is what makes it
  self-contained.

- **How many such points there are.** The eventually constant sequences form an
  at most countable set, while $C$ is uncountable
  ([[thm-cantor-set-properties]]); so the endpoints are a vanishing part of $C$
  and the refuted claim fails not marginally but completely.

- **$1/4$ is also where the Cantor function takes the value $1/3$**
  ([[ex-cantor-function-values]]), and it is the one value in that example whose
  computation needs the whole infinite digit sequence rather than a finite
  initial segment.

## Statement

In any ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, the multiplicative identity
satisfies $0 < 1$; that is, $1 \in P$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$ and multiplicative identity $1$ ([[def-field]]).

[L1] In any field $1 \neq 0$ ([[def-field]]).

[L2] For every $x \neq 0$ the square satisfies $x^2 > 0$ ([[lem-of-square-positive]]).

[L3] The identity axiom gives $1 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1^2$ ([[def-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By the field axioms $1 \neq 0$, and $1 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1^2$. [L1, L3]

2.1 Since $1 \neq 0$, applying the square lemma with $x = 1$ gives $1^2 > 0$. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 Because $1 = 1^2$, it follows that $1 > 0$, i.e. $0 < 1$. [step 2.1, step 1.1, L3] ∎

## Definition

For $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ write

$$\tfrac{1}{3} S \;:=\; \{\, x \cdot 3^{-1} : x \in S \,\}, \qquad \tfrac{2}{3} + \tfrac{1}{3} S \;:=\; \{\, 2 \cdot 3^{-1} + x \cdot 3^{-1} : x \in S \,\},$$

and let $F : \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}) \to \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})$ be

$$F(S) \;:=\; \tfrac{1}{3} S \ \cup \ \big(\tfrac{2}{3} + \tfrac{1}{3} S\big).$$

By the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]), applied to the set
$\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})$, the starting element $[0,1]$ ([[def-interval]]) and
the function $F$, there is a unique family $(C_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of subsets
of $\mathbb{R}$ with

$$C_0 = [0,1], \qquad C_{n+1} = F(C_n) = \tfrac{1}{3}C_n \cup \big(\tfrac{2}{3} + \tfrac{1}{3}C_n\big) \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

The **Cantor middle-thirds set** is

$$C \;:=\; \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} C_n .$$

**The first step really is the removal of the open middle third.** Directly from
the clauses,

$$C_1 \;=\; \tfrac{1}{3}[0,1] \cup \big(\tfrac{2}{3} + \tfrac{1}{3}[0,1]\big) \;=\; [0, \tfrac13] \cup [\tfrac23, 1] \;=\; [0,1] \setminus (\tfrac13, \tfrac23),$$

the middle equality because $x \mapsto x \cdot 3^{-1}$ is an order isomorphism of
$\mathbb{R}$ onto itself with inverse $x \mapsto 3x$ ([[def-ordered-field]],
[[lem-of-sign-rules]]), and the last because $0 \le x \le 1$ splits, by
totality of the order, into $x \le \tfrac13$, $\tfrac13 < x < \tfrac23$ and
$x \ge \tfrac23$. The recursion then performs the same operation inside each of
the two scaled copies, which is what "removing the open middle thirds" names.

**Every $C_n$ lies in $[0,1]$**, by induction on $n$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]):
$C_0 = [0,1]$; and if $C_n \subseteq [0,1]$ then $\tfrac13 C_n \subseteq [0,\tfrac13]$
and $\tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C_n \subseteq [\tfrac23, 1]$, so
$C_{n+1} \subseteq [0,1]$ ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]]). The same
computation shows that **the two halves of $C_{n+1}$ are disjoint**, the first
lying in $[0,\tfrac13]$ and the second in $[\tfrac23,1]$, and $\tfrac13 < \tfrac23$
([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

**The family is nested**, $C_{n+1} \subseteq C_n$ for every $n$, again by
induction. For $n = 0$ this is $C_1 = [0,\tfrac13] \cup [\tfrac23,1] \subseteq
[0,1]$. And $F$ is monotone, in the sense that $S \subseteq T$ implies
$F(S) \subseteq F(T)$, directly from the displayed description of $F$; so
$C_{n+1} \subseteq C_n$ gives $C_{n+2} = F(C_{n+1}) \subseteq F(C_n) = C_{n+1}$.
Consequently $C = \bigcap_n C_n \subseteq C_m$ for every $m$, and
$\bigcap_n C_{n+1} = \bigcap_n C_n = C$.

**Powers.** Here $3^{-n}$ means $(3^{-1})^n$, the integer power of
[[def-integer-power]], so that $3^{0} = 1$, $3^{-(n+1)} \cdot 3 = 3^{-n}$ and
$3^{-n} > 0$ for every $n$ ([[lem-power-laws]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Remarks

- **Why the self-similar recursion rather than a description by digits.** The
  clause $C_{n+1} = F(C_n)$ is a single application of [[thm-recursion]] to one
  explicitly given function on $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})$, so nothing is selected
  at any stage and no listing of the $2^n$ intervals making up $C_n$ has to be
  constructed. Every structural property below is then proved by induction on
  $n$ through $F$. The description by ternary digits is a theorem about $C$, not
  its definition, and it is [[thm-cantor-set-ternary-description]].

- **$C$ is not empty.** $0 \in C_n$ for every $n$, by induction:
  $0 \in [0,1]$, and $0 \in C_n$ gives $0 = 0 \cdot 3^{-1} \in \tfrac13 C_n
  \subseteq C_{n+1}$. Likewise $1 \in C$, since $1 \in C_n$ gives
  $1 = \tfrac23 + 1 \cdot \tfrac13 \in C_{n+1}$. So $C$ contains at least the two
  endpoints; that it is in fact uncountable is
  [[thm-cantor-set-properties]].

- **The construction with a different proportion.** Replacing "middle third" by
  an interval of length $4^{-n}$ removed at stage $n$ produces a set that is
  closed, has empty interior and is *not* of measure zero
  ([[def-fat-cantor-set]]). So none of the qualitative properties of $C$ proved
  on this page is a consequence of its being nowhere dense, and the two
  constructions are kept apart deliberately.

## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq F$.

- $u \in F$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$; $S$ is
  **bounded above** if it has an upper bound.
- $u \in F$ is a **least upper bound** (or **supremum**, $\sup S$) of $S$ if $u$
  is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le u'$ for every upper bound $u'$ of $S$.

$F$ is a **complete ordered field** (equivalently, $F$ has the
**least-upper-bound property**, or is **Dedekind complete**) if every nonempty
$S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$.

## Remarks

- A least upper bound, if it exists, is unique (two least upper bounds are each
  $\le$ the other, so equal by antisymmetry of the order).
- Applying the property to $\{-s : s \in S\}$ yields the dual **greatest lower
  bound** (infimum) property, so the two are equivalent.
- The Dedekind-cut reals have this property by construction
  ([[thm-dedekind-complete]]); the Cauchy-sequence reals acquire it via
  [[cor-cauchy-reals-lub-complete]]. This definition is the target for the
  uniqueness theorem [[thm-uniqueness-complete-ordered-field]].

## Definition

Let $a \in \mathbb{R}$, where $\mathbb{R}$ is the ambient ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]).

**Natural exponents.** By the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) applied to
the set $\mathbb{R}$, the starting element $1$ and the function
$f(x) = x \cdot a$, there is a unique function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$,
written $n \mapsto a^n$, with

$$a^0 = 1, \qquad a^{n+1} = a^n \cdot a \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Thus $a^1 = a$, $a^2 = a \cdot a$, and so on. Note that this is defined for
**every** $a$, including $a = 0$.

**Negative exponents.** If $a \ne 0$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, set

$$a^{-n} := (a^n)^{-1}.$$

**Why that is legitimate.** The right-hand side presupposes that $a^n$ is
invertible, that is, that $a^n \ne 0$. This is a proof obligation and not an
observation, and it is discharged by claim 2 of [[lem-power-laws]]: for $a \ne 0$
in a field, $a^n \ne 0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, proved there by induction on
$n$ from the fact that a field has no zero divisors ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]).
That lemma is a statement *about* the operation introduced here, so it depends on
this definition and is recorded in this item's `justified_by` rather than in its
`deps` (SCHEMA §3). Given $a^n \ne 0$, the value $(a^n)^{-1}$ is a single
well-determined element, because multiplicative inverses in a field are unique
([[lem-of-inverse-unique]]).

**Integer exponents.** Every integer $m$ ([[def-integers]]) is either
$\iota(n)$ or $-\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$, where $\iota$ is the
embedding $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]],
[[def-int-operations]]). This too is a citation and not a slogan: the order on
$\mathbb{Z}$ is total ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), so $m \ge 0$ or $m < 0$; the
image of $\iota$ is exactly the set of nonnegative integers, and each of them is
$\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]); and if $m < 0$ then
$-m > 0$, by compatibility of the order with addition ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]),
so $-m = \iota(n)$ and $m = -\iota(n)$, with $n$ unique because $\iota$ is
injective. The two clauses above therefore define $a^m$ for every
$m \in \mathbb{Z}$ whenever $a \ne 0$, and for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$ for
arbitrary $a$. The clauses are consistent where they overlap: the only overlap is
$m = 0$, where $-\iota(0) = \iota(0)$ and $(a^0)^{-1} = 1^{-1} = 1 = a^0$.

## Remarks

- **The convention $0^0 = 1$ is adopted here**, and it is not a matter of taste
  but of agreement with the recursion above: $a^0 = 1$ is the starting value for
  every $a$, exactly as the empty product is $1$ ([[def-finite-sum]]). This is
  the convention that makes the empty product, the binomial theorem, and
  polynomial notation $\sum_k c_k x^k$ work at $x = 0$ without an exception. The
  competing convention "$0^0$ undefined" belongs to contexts where $x^y$ is
  studied as a function of two *real* variables and one wants continuity, which
  is unavailable and irrelevant here: the exponent in $a^m$ is an integer, never
  a real.
- $0^n = 0$ for every $n \ge 1$, since $0^{n} = 0^{n-1} \cdot 0 = 0$, a product
  with a zero factor ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]); and
  $0^{-n}$ is not defined for $n \ge 1$, since $0$ has no inverse.
- The exponent is an integer and stays an integer. Rational exponents are a
  separate construction resting on the existence of roots
  ([[thm-nth-roots-exist]], [[def-rational-power]]), and real exponents do not
  exist in this library yet ([[rem-real-exponents-deferred]]).
- The laws $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$ are
  proved, not assumed, in [[lem-power-laws]]; the order behaviour of $a \mapsto a^n$
  is [[lem-power-monotone]].

## Definition

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ ([[def-field]]) together with a subset
$P \subseteq F$, the set of **positive** elements (the *positive cone*),
satisfying:

- **(O1) Trichotomy.** For each $x \in F$, exactly one of the following holds:
  $x \in P$, or $x = 0$, or $-x \in P$.
- **(O2) Closure.** If $x, y \in P$ then $x + y \in P$ and $x \cdot y \in P$.

We write $x > 0$ for $x \in P$ (read "$x$ is positive"), and define the order by

$$a < b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; b - a \in P, \qquad a \le b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; a < b \text{ or } a = b.$$

Thus $a > b$ means $b < a$, and $a \ge b$ means $b \le a$. An element $x$ with
$-x \in P$ (equivalently $x < 0$) is called **negative**.

## Remarks

- By trichotomy applied to $b - a$, for any $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$,
  $a = b$, $a > b$ holds; this makes $\le$ a total order.
- (O2) says the positives are closed under addition and multiplication: sums and
  products of positives are positive.
- The rationals ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and both constructions of the reals
  ([[thm-reals-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-dedekind-ordered-field]]) are ordered
  fields, so every fact proved here from (O1)-(O2) holds in each of them.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]],
[[def-real-numbers]]) with its order and absolute value ([[def-real-order]]), and
$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers with its order ([[def-natural-numbers]],
[[def-nat-order]]).

A **sequence of reals** is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$. We write
$x_k$ for the value $x(k)$, call it the **$k$-th term**, and write $(x_k)$, or
$(x_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$, for the function itself. The **range** of $(x_k)$ is
the subset $\{\, x_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals and let $P$ be a property of indices.

- $(x_k)$ is **bounded** if there is $M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for
  every $k \in \mathbb{N}$; it is **unbounded** otherwise.
- $P$ holds **eventually** if there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $P(k)$ holds
  for every $k \ge K$.
- $P$ holds **frequently** if for every $K \in \mathbb{N}$ there is some
  $k \ge K$ for which $P(k)$ holds.
- For $K \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$K$-th tail** of $(x_k)$ is the sequence
  $x^{(K)}$ defined by $x^{(K)}_j := x_{j + K}$ for $j \in \mathbb{N}$; it is
  again a sequence of reals.
- A function $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is **strictly increasing** if
  $n_j < n_k$ whenever $j < k$. For such an $n$, the **subsequence** of $(x_k)$
  along $n$ is the composite $x \circ n$, written $(x_{n_k})_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$;
  it is again a sequence of reals.

**Convergence and Cauchyness are not defined here.** They are already fixed, for
sequences of reals, by the published [[def-real-limit]]: $(x_k)$ *converges* to
$x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is
$K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$, and $(x_k)$
is *Cauchy* when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$
with $|x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$. This page builds the
toolkit for those two notions and does not restate them. A sequence
**converges** if it converges to some real, and **diverges** if it does not.

## Remarks

- **Identification of $\mathbb{Q}$ with its image.** The map $q \mapsto \hat q$
  is an embedding of ordered fields ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and as is
  standard we write $q$ for $\hat q$, so that a rational may be compared with a
  real without further comment. [[def-real-limit]] is stated with the hat; every
  rational $\varepsilon$ occurring on this page is its image under this
  embedding.

- **Rational and real $\varepsilon$ agree.** [[def-real-limit]] tests convergence
  against every *rational* $\varepsilon > 0$, and its own remark records that
  this loses nothing. Spelled out: suppose that for every rational
  $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all
  $k \ge K$, and let $\eta > 0$ be an arbitrary *real*. Since $0 < \eta$,
  density of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) supplies a
  rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, and the index $K$
  belonging to that $\varepsilon$ satisfies $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon < \eta$ for
  all $k \ge K$. The converse implication is immediate, since every positive
  rational is a positive real. So the two formulations define the same relation,
  and the same two lines apply verbatim to the Cauchy condition and to any
  condition of the shape "for every $\varepsilon > 0$, eventually
  $\cdots < \varepsilon$". Proofs on this page therefore run the test with a real
  $\varepsilon$ wherever that is more convenient, and say so by citing this
  remark; nothing is smuggled in.

- **Constant sequences converge.** For $c \in \mathbb{R}$ the constant sequence
  $x_k := c$ converges to $c$, because $|x_k - c| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ for
  every $\varepsilon > 0$ and every $k$; it is bounded by $|c|$.

- **Eventually and frequently are dual.** $P$ holds frequently exactly when
  $\lnot P$ does not hold eventually, and $P$ holds eventually exactly when
  $\lnot P$ does not hold frequently. So the two quantifier patterns are
  negations of one another applied to the complementary property, and there is no
  third pattern hiding between them.

- **A sequence is not its range.** $(x_k)$ is a function, not a set, and the
  range does not determine the function: the sequence $x_0 = 0$, $x_k = 1$ for
  $k \ge 1$ and the sequence $y_0 = y_1 = 0$, $y_k = 1$ for $k \ge 2$ have the
  same range $\{0, 1\}$, yet they differ at $k = 1$, so they are different
  sequences. Order and repetition are part of the data and the range forgets
  both. Boundedness, on the other hand, depends only on the range.

- **Indexing.** Sequences here start at $k = 0$ because $\mathbb{N}$ contains
  $0$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]). Texts that index from $1$ describe the same
  objects up to a shift, and the shift changes nothing about convergence, by
  [[lem-limit-of-tail]].

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-real-numbers]]) and
a **sequence of reals** is a function $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$
([[def-sequence]]), written $(a_k)$; recall that $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$.

**Partial sums.** Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals. Its **sequence of partial
sums** is

$$s_n \;:=\; \sum_{k < n} a_k \qquad (n \in \mathbb{N}),$$

the finite sum of [[def-finite-sum]]. In particular $s_0 = 0$, the empty sum, and
$s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ for every $n$, those being exactly the two recursion clauses
that define the finite sum. Note that $s_n$ is the sum of the $n$ terms
$a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$, so the index $n$ counts terms rather than naming the last
one.

**Convergence, the sum, divergence.** The **series** of $(a_k)$, written
$\sum a_k$, **converges** when the sequence $(s_n)$ of partial sums converges
([[def-real-limit]]), and then the **sum of the series** is

$$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k \;:=\; \lim_{n} s_n .$$

The series **diverges** when $(s_n)$ does not converge. A convergent sequence of
reals has exactly one limit ([[lem-limit-unique]]), so the displayed symbol names
a single real number and nothing further has to be checked for it to be
well defined.

**Series with a general starting index.** Let $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $a$ be a
function on $\{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : k \ge m \,\}$, which we call a **family from
$m$** and write $(a_k)_{k \ge m}$. The series

$$\sum_{k \ge m} a_k$$

is by definition the series of the sequence $b_j := a_{j + m}$,
$j \in \mathbb{N}$, which is a genuine sequence of reals; it converges exactly
when that series converges, and its sum is then written
$\sum_{k = m}^{\infty} a_k$. Its partial sums are

$$\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k \;=\; \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j} \qquad (n \ge m),$$

in the notation of [[def-finite-sum]], the value at $n = m$ being the empty sum
$0$. A sequence on $\mathbb{N}$ is the case $m = 0$, and the two readings of
$\sum a_k$ agree there, since $b_j = a_j$.

**This clause is not a convenience.** Sequences in this library are functions on
$\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$ ([[def-sequence]]), while many of the
classical series are built from expressions that are undefined at the index $0$:
$1/k$, $1/k^{p}$ and $|a_k|^{1/k}$ all require $k \ge 1$. Writing such a series as
$\sum_{k \ge 1} a_k$ names an honest object, whereas writing it as a sequence on
$\mathbb{N}$ would require a value at an index where the defining expression has
none. Every statement on this page says which starting index it uses.

**Tail series.** For $N \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$N$-th tail series** of
$\sum a_k$ is $\sum_{k \ge N} a_k$, that is the series of the $N$-th tail
$a^{(N)}$ of [[def-sequence]], whose terms are $a^{(N)}_j = a_{j+N}$. The
$0$-th tail series is the series itself.

## Remarks

- **"Diverges" here means "does not converge", and nothing more.** A divergent
  series may have partial sums that run away to $+\infty$, or to $-\infty$, or
  that oscillate without settling anywhere. The three behaviours are not
  distinguished by the word, and no statement on this page uses "diverges" to
  mean "the partial sums are unbounded" unless it says so.

- **The symbol $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k$ is defined only for a convergent
  series.** It denotes a real number, not a formal object, and it is illegitimate
  to write it down before convergence has been established. Where a proof needs
  to speak of the series without knowing whether it converges, it speaks of
  $(a_k)$ and of $(s_n)$.

- **Two indices, doing different work.** The index $k$ runs over the terms and is
  bound; the index $n$ runs over the partial sums and is the variable in which the
  limit is taken. Confusing them is the commonest slip in the subject, and it is
  the reason the definition above fixes $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ rather than
  $\sum_{k \le n} a_k$: with this choice the recursion $s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ is
  the one supplied by [[def-finite-sum]], with no shift anywhere.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b, c, d \in F$.

1. **Translation invariance.** If $a < b$ then $a + c < b + c$.
2. **Adding inequalities.** If $a < b$ and $c < d$ then $a + c < b + d$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b, c, d \in F$.

[L1] For $x, y \in F$, the relation $x < y$ means $y - x \in P$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] $P$ is closed under addition: if $u, v \in P$ then $u + v \in P$ (axiom O2 of [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a < b$; by the definition of the order this means $b - a \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.2 For every $c \in F$ the field identities give $(b + c) - (a + c) = b - a$. [algebra]

1.3 Assume moreover $c < d$; by the definition of the order this means $d - c \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.4 The field identities give $(b + d) - (a + c) = (b - a) + (d - c)$. [algebra]

2.1 Hence $(b + c) - (a + c) = b - a \in P$, which is exactly $a + c < b + c$, proving claim 1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1]

2.2 Since $b - a \in P$ and $d - c \in P$, closure under addition gives $(b - a) + (d - c) \in P$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, L2]

3.1 Therefore $(b + d) - (a + c) = (b - a) + (d - c) \in P$, which is exactly $a + c < b + d$, proving claim 2. [step 1.4, step 2.2, L1] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b, c \in F$.

1. If $a > 0$ and $b > 0$ then $ab > 0$.
2. If $a > 0$ and $b < 0$ then $ab < 0$.
3. If $a < 0$ and $b < 0$ then $ab > 0$.
4. If $c > 0$ then $a < b \iff ac < bc$.
5. If $c < 0$ then $a < b \iff bc < ac$ (multiplication by a negative reverses order).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b, c \in F$.

[L1] For $x, y \in F$: $x < y \iff y - x \in P$; $x > 0 \iff x \in P$; $x < 0 \iff -x \in P$; and (trichotomy) for each $x$ exactly one of $x \in P$, $x = 0$, $-x \in P$ holds, so $0 \notin P$ and $x \in P \Rightarrow x \neq 0$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] $P$ is closed under multiplication: if $u, v \in P$ then $uv \in P$ (axiom O2 of [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] In any field, $(-u)v = -(uv)$ and $(-u)(-v) = uv$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] In any field, $0 \cdot u = 0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a > 0$ and $b > 0$, i.e. $a \in P$ and $b \in P$; closure gives $ab \in P$, so $ab > 0$, proving claim 1. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.2 Assume $a > 0$ and $b < 0$, i.e. $a \in P$ and $-b \in P$; closure gives $a(-b) \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.3 Assume $a < 0$ and $b < 0$, i.e. $-a \in P$ and $-b \in P$; closure gives $(-a)(-b) \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.4 Assume $c > 0$ and $a < b$, i.e. $c \in P$ and $b - a \in P$; closure gives $(b - a)c \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.5 Assume $c < 0$ and $a < b$, i.e. $-c \in P$ and $b - a \in P$; closure gives $(b - a)(-c) \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

2.1 Since $a(-b) = -(ab)$ by L3, step 1.2 gives $-(ab) \in P$, so $ab < 0$, proving claim 2. [step 1.2, L3, L1]

2.2 Since $(-a)(-b) = ab$ by L3, step 1.3 gives $ab \in P$, so $ab > 0$, proving claim 3. [step 1.3, L3, L1]

2.3 By distributivity $(b - a)c = bc - ac$, so step 1.4 gives $bc - ac \in P$, i.e. $ac < bc$: this is the forward direction of claim 4. [step 1.4, algebra, L1]

2.4 By L3 and distributivity $(b - a)(-c) = -((b - a)c) = -(bc - ac) = ac - bc$, so step 1.5 gives $ac - bc \in P$, i.e. $bc < ac$: this is the forward direction of claim 5. [step 1.5, L3, algebra, L1]

3.1 Conversely, assume $c > 0$ and $ac < bc$; by trichotomy exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds. If $a = b$ then $ac = bc$, contradicting $ac < bc$; if $b < a$ then the argument of step 2.3 applied to the pair $b < a$ gives $bc < ac$, so $bc - ac \in P$ (from $ac < bc$) while $ac - bc \in P$ (from $bc < ac$), putting the element $bc - ac$ and its negative $ac - bc$ both in $P$, which trichotomy forbids; hence $a < b$: this completes claim 4. [assume-hyp, step 2.3, L4, L1, algebra]

4.1 Conversely, assume $c < 0$ and $bc < ac$; by trichotomy exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds. If $a = b$ then $ac = bc$, contradicting $bc < ac$; if $b < a$ then the argument of step 2.4 applied to the pair $b < a$ gives $ac < bc$, so $ac - bc \in P$ (from $bc < ac$) while $bc - ac \in P$ (from $ac < bc$), putting the element $ac - bc$ and its negative $bc - ac$ both in $P$, which trichotomy forbids; hence $a < b$: this completes claim 5.

## Statement

Let $a, b$ be elements of a field ([[def-field]]) and let integer powers be as in
[[def-integer-power]].

1. For all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$: $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$.
2. If $a \ne 0$ then $a^n \ne 0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and $a^{-m} = (a^m)^{-1}$ for every $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ ([[def-int-operations]]).
3. If $a \ne 0$ and $b \ne 0$ then all three identities of claim 1 hold for all $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Elements $a, b$ of a field $F$, naturals $m, n, p, q, k$ and integers ranged over by $m, n$ in claims 2 and 3.

[L1] Definition of powers ([[def-integer-power]]): $a^0 = 1$ and $a^{n+1} = a^n a$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$; and $a^{-n} := (a^n)^{-1}$ for $a \ne 0$ and $n \ge 1$, the two clauses agreeing at $n = 0$.

[L2] Induction principle ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L3] Field arithmetic: multiplication is associative and commutative with identity $1$, and every nonzero element has an inverse ([[def-field]]); inverses are unique ([[lem-of-inverse-unique]], which states uniqueness and nothing further), and HENCE, for $x, y \ne 0$, $(xy)^{-1} = x^{-1} y^{-1}$ and $(x^{-1})^{-1} = x$, since $(xy)(x^{-1}y^{-1}) = 1$ and $x^{-1}x = 1$ exhibit inverses that uniqueness then identifies.

[L4] A field has no zero divisors: $xy = 0$ implies $x = 0$ or $y = 0$ ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]).

[L5] $\mathbb{Z}$ is a commutative ring in which every element is $\iota(k)$ or $-\iota(k)$ for a unique natural $k$ ([[thm-int-comm-ring]], [[lem-nat-embeds-int]], [[def-int-operations]]); we write $k$ for $\iota(k)$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base cases at $n = 0$ for the addition law, the product law and nonvanishing: $a^{m+0} = a^m = a^m \cdot 1 = a^m a^0$ for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$; $(ab)^0 = 1 = 1 \cdot 1 = a^0 b^0$; and if $a \ne 0$ then $a^0 = 1 \ne 0$. [base, L1, L3]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$ for all $m \in \mathbb{N}$, $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$, and $a^n \ne 0$ whenever $a \ne 0$. The iterated-power law $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ is deliberately NOT carried in this hypothesis: its successor step needs the addition law at the exponent pair $(mn, m)$, whose second entry is not the current stage, so that law must be finished first and the iterated law proved afterwards. [ih]

1.3 For $a \ne 0$ and every integer $j$, $a^{-j} = (a^j)^{-1}$: for $j \ge 0$ this is the definition together with the agreement of the two clauses at $j = 0$, and for $j = -k$ with $k \ge 1$ it reads $a^{k} = (a^{-k})^{-1}$, which holds because $a^{-k} = (a^k)^{-1}$ and $(x^{-1})^{-1} = x$ at $x = a^{k}$. That last substitution needs $a^{k} \ne 0$, which is NOT free here and must not be read off the definition, since the definition of the negative clause is what is being justified; it is instead a self-contained induction on $k$, from $a^{0} = 1 \ne 0$ and the fact that $a^{k+1} = a^{k}a$ is a product of two nonzero elements of a field, hence nonzero. [L1, L2, L3, L4, L5]

2.1 Successor step for the addition law, the product law and nonvanishing: $a^{m+(n+1)} = a^{(m+n)+1} = a^{m+n} a = (a^m a^n) a = a^m (a^n a) = a^m a^{n+1}$ for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$; $(ab)^{n+1} = (ab)^n (ab) = (a^n b^n)(ab) = (a^n a)(b^n b) = a^{n+1} b^{n+1}$; and if $a \ne 0$ then $a^{n+1} = a^n a$ is a product of two nonzero elements, hence nonzero. [step 1.2, L1, L3, L4]

3.1 By the induction principle, for all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$: $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$, and $a^n \ne 0$ whenever $a \ne 0$. The addition law is thereby available at EVERY pair of natural exponents, which is exactly what the iterated-power law needs. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L2]

4.1 The iterated-power law for natural exponents, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$, by a second induction on $n$ with $m \in \mathbb{N}$ fixed: at $n = 0$ both sides are $1$, since $(a^m)^0 = 1 = a^0 = a^{m \cdot 0}$; and if $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ then $(a^m)^{n+1} = (a^m)^n a^m = a^{mn} a^m = a^{mn+m} = a^{m(n+1)}$, where the third equality is the addition law of step 3.1 at the pair $(mn, m)$, legitimate precisely because that law is by now proved for all pairs of naturals. This completes claim 1. [step 3.1, L1, L2, L3]

4.2 For $a \ne 0$ and every integer $j$, $a^{j+1} = a^j a$: for $j \ge 0$ this is the recursion clause, and for $j = -k$ with $k \ge 1$ we compute $a^{-k} a = (a^k)^{-1} a = (a^{k-1} a)^{-1} a = (a^{k-1})^{-1} a^{-1} a = (a^{k-1})^{-1} = a^{-(k-1)} = a^{-k+1}$. [step 3.1, step 1.3, L1, L3]

4.3 For $a, b \ne 0$ the product law holds for all integers $n$: for $n \ge 0$ it is step 3.1, and for $n = -k$ with $k \ge 1$ we get $(ab)^{-k} = ((ab)^k)^{-1} = (a^k b^k)^{-1} = (a^k)^{-1}(b^k)^{-1} = a^{-k} b^{-k}$. [step 3.1, step 1.3, L3, L5]

5.1 For $a \ne 0$, every integer $j$ and every natural $k$, $a^{j+k} = a^j a^k$, by induction on $k$: the case $k = 0$ is $a^j = a^j \cdot 1$, and if $a^{j+k} = a^j a^k$ then $a^{j+k+1} = a^{j+k} a = a^j a^k a = a^j a^{k+1}$ by step 4.2 applied to the integer $j+k$ and by the recursion clause. [step 4.2, L1, L2, L3]

6.1 For $a \ne 0$ the addition law holds for all integers $m, n$: writing $n = k$ or $n = -k$ with $k \in \mathbb{N}$, the case $n = k$ is step 5.1, while for $n = -k$ step 5.1 applied to the integer $m - k$ gives $a^m = a^{(m-k)+k} = a^{m-k} a^k$, hence $a^{m-k} = a^m (a^k)^{-1} = a^m a^{-k}$. [step 5.1, step 1.3, L3, L5]

7.1 For $a \ne 0$ the iterated-power law holds for all integers $m, n$: for $n \ge 0$ induction on $n$ gives $(a^m)^{n+1} = (a^m)^n a^m = a^{mn} a^m = a^{mn+m} = a^{m(n+1)}$, the third equality by the integer addition law of step 6.1 at the pair $(mn, m)$, with base $(a^m)^0 = 1 = a^0$; and for $n = -q$ with $q \ge 1$, $(a^m)^{-q} = ((a^m)^q)^{-1} = (a^{mq})^{-1} = a^{-mq} = a^{m(-q)}$, using that $a^m \ne 0$ by step 3.1 and step 1.3. [step 6.1, step 3.1, step 1.3, L2, L3, L5]

8.1 Claims 1, 2 and 3 are therefore established: the addition, product and iterated-power laws for natural exponents together with nonvanishing by steps 3.1 and 4.1, the identity $a^{-m} = (a^m)^{-1}$ by step 1.3, and the three integer-exponent laws by steps 6.1, 4.3 and 7.1. [step 3.1, step 4.1, step 1.3, step 6.1, step 4.3, step 7.1, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ be sequences of reals whose series converge
([[def-series]]), and let $c \in \mathbb{R}$. Then:

1. $\sum (a_k + b_k)$ converges, with
   $\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k + \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} b_k$;
2. $\sum c\,a_k$ converges, with
   $\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c\,a_k = c \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k$.

Moreover, for $c \ne 0$ and an arbitrary sequence $(a_k)$, whose series is not
assumed to converge:

3. $\sum c\,a_k$ converges **if and only if** $\sum a_k$ converges. Equivalently,
   $\sum a_k$ diverges if and only if $\sum c\,a_k$ diverges.

Claim 3 is the form used whenever a comparison is made against a constant
multiple of a known series.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $(a_k)$, $(b_k)$ of reals and $c \in \mathbb{R}$, with partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $t_n = \sum_{k<n} b_k$ ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[L1] Additivity and scaling of finite sums: $\sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k$ and $\sum_{k<n} c\,a_k = c \sum_{k<n} a_k$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L2] Algebra of limits: if $x_n \to x$ and $y_n \to y$ then $x_n + y_n \to x + y$ and $c\,x_n \to c\,x$ ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The partial sums of $\sum (a_k + b_k)$ are $\sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) = s_n + t_n$, and those of $\sum c\,a_k$ are $\sum_{k<n} c\,a_k = c\,s_n$. [given, L1]

1.2 Assume $\sum a_k$ and $\sum b_k$ converge, say $s_n \to S$ and $t_n \to T$. [given]

2.1 Then $s_n + t_n \to S + T$, so $\sum(a_k + b_k)$ converges with sum $S + T$, which is claim 1. [step 1.2, step 1.1, L2]

2.2 Likewise $c\,s_n \to c\,S$, so $\sum c\,a_k$ converges with sum $c\,S$, which is claim 2. [step 1.2, step 1.1, L2]

3.1 For claim 3, let $c \ne 0$ and let $(a_k)$ be arbitrary. If $\sum a_k$ converges then $\sum c\,a_k$ converges by claim 2. [step 2.2]

3.2 Conversely, if $\sum c\,a_k$ converges then applying claim 2 to the sequence $(c\,a_k)$ and the scalar $1/c$, which exists since $c \ne 0$, shows that $\sum (1/c)(c\,a_k) = \sum a_k$ converges. [step 2.2, algebra]

4.1 The two implications are claim 3, and its contrapositive form is the statement about divergence. [step 3.1, step 3.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **There is no product rule here, and there is no rule for $\sum a_k b_k$.** The proof works because a finite sum is additive and homogeneous, and neither property has an analogue for products. Multiplying series is a genuinely harder question, requiring absolute convergence, and it is not treated on this page.

- **Claim 3 needs $c \ne 0$ and nothing else.** In particular it does not need either series to converge, which is what makes it usable in the divergence direction: scaling a divergent series by a nonzero constant leaves it divergent.

## Statement

Let $C$ be the Cantor set ([[def-cantor-set]]). Then:

1. $C$ is closed and bounded, hence compact
   ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]]);
2. $C$ has content zero, and therefore measure zero
   ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]);
3. $C$ is perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]);
4. $C$ is uncountable ([[def-countable]]);
5. $C$ contains no interval with two distinct endpoints, and is nowhere dense
   ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]]);
6. every nonempty connected subset of $C$ ([[def-connected-r]]) is a single
   point.

Claim 6 is what the phrase "totally disconnected" names elsewhere; that phrase
is **not** used here, because no definition of total disconnectedness exists at
this point in the reading order. What is proved is exactly the displayed
statement, and it is obtained from claim 5 through
[[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The sets $C_n$ and $C$ of [[def-cantor-set]], and the map $\Phi$ and the set $D$ of $\{0,2\}$-valued sequences of [[thm-cantor-set-ternary-description]].

[L1] $C_0 = [0,1]$, $C_{n+1} = \tfrac13 C_n \cup (\tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C_n)$, $C = \bigcap_n C_n \subseteq C_m$ for every $m$, every $C_n \subseteq [0,1]$, $0 \in C$, and $3^{-n} = (3^{-1})^n$ ([[def-cantor-set]], [[def-interval]], [[def-integer-power]], [[lem-power-laws]]).

[L2] $\Phi$ is a bijection from $D$ onto $C$, $\Phi(a) = \sum_{k \ge 0} a_k 3^{-k-1}$, and convergent series add and scale termwise ([[thm-cantor-set-ternary-description]], [[lem-series-linearity]], [[def-series]]).

[L3] $[c,d]$ is a closed set and a bounded interval, $(c,d)$ is open, $N_\varepsilon(x) = (x-\varepsilon, x+\varepsilon)$, and every open set contains a neighbourhood of each of its points ([[def-interval]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L4] Finite unions of closed sets are closed, and an intersection of a nonempty family of closed sets is closed ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]).

[L5] A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is compact exactly when it is closed and bounded ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L6] Content zero and measure zero as in [[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]; a set of content zero is null ([[lem-content-zero-implies-null]]); no null set contains an interval $[u,v]$ with $u < v$ ([[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]]).

[L7] $P$ is perfect when it is closed and no point of it is isolated in it ([[def-perfect-set-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]); every nonempty perfect subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable ([[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]], [[def-countable]]).

[L8] A set is nowhere dense exactly when the interior of its closure is empty, and a closed set equals its closure ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]]).

[L12] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 > 0$, $3 > 0$, $3^{-1} > 0$ and $0 < 2 \cdot 3^{-1} < 1$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve an inequality; the order is total and transitive ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **$C$ is compact, claim 1.** First, for $\lambda \ne 0$ and $c \in \mathbb{R}$ the set $\lambda S + c := \{\lambda s + c : s \in S\}$ is closed whenever $S$ is: if $x \notin \lambda S + c$ then $(x - c)\lambda^{-1} \notin S$, so by [L3] there is a real $\eta > 0$ with $N_\eta((x-c)\lambda^{-1}) \cap S = \varnothing$, and every $z$ with $|z - x| < |\lambda|\eta$ satisfies $|(z-c)\lambda^{-1} - (x-c)\lambda^{-1}| = |z-x| \cdot |\lambda|^{-1} < \eta$ by [L10] and [L12], hence $(z-c)\lambda^{-1} \notin S$ and $z \notin \lambda S + c$. Now every $C_n$ is closed, by induction on $n$ ([L11]): $C_0 = [0,1]$ is closed by [L3], and $C_{n+1}$ is the union of the two closed sets $\tfrac13 C_n$ and $\tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C_n$, hence closed by [L4]. So $C = \bigcap_n C_n$ is closed by [L4], and $C \subseteq [0,1]$ is bounded by [L1] and [L3]; by [L5] it is compact. [L1, L3, L4, L5, L10, L11, L12]

1.2 **$C$ has content zero and measure zero, claim 2.** By induction on $n$ ([L11]) the following holds for every $n$: there are $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and reals $u_0 \le v_0, \dots, u_m \le v_m$ with $C_n \subseteq \bigcup_{j \le m}[u_j,v_j]$ and $\sum_{j \le m}(v_j - u_j) = (2 \cdot 3^{-1})^{n}$. At $n = 0$ take the single interval $[0,1]$, of total length $1 = (2 \cdot 3^{-1})^0$ by [L1]. Given such a list at $n$, define $2m + 2$ intervals by $[u_j 3^{-1},\, v_j 3^{-1}]$ for $j \le m$ and $[2 \cdot 3^{-1} + u_{j-m-1}3^{-1},\, 2 \cdot 3^{-1} + v_{j-m-1}3^{-1}]$ for $m < j \le 2m+1$; they cover $\tfrac13 C_n$ and $\tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C_n$ respectively, hence cover $C_{n+1}$, and their total length is $3^{-1}(2 \cdot 3^{-1})^{n} + 3^{-1}(2 \cdot 3^{-1})^{n} = (2 \cdot 3^{-1})^{n+1}$ by [L11] and [L12]. Since $0 < 2 \cdot 3^{-1} < 1$ by [L12], [L10] gives, for every real $\varepsilon > 0$, an $n$ with $(2 \cdot 3^{-1})^{n} \le \varepsilon$; as $C \subseteq C_n$ by [L1], the corresponding finite list covers $C$ with total length at most $\varepsilon$. So $C$ has content zero by [L6], and hence measure zero by [L6]. [L1, L6, L10, L11, L12]

2.1 **$C$ is perfect, claim 3.** $C$ is closed by step 1.1. Let $x \in C$ and let the real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. By [L2] write $x = \Phi(a)$ with $a \in D$. By [L10] and [L12] fix $k \in \mathbb{N}$ with $2 \cdot 3^{-k-1} < \varepsilon$, and define $b \in D$ by $b_j := a_j$ for $j \ne k$ and $b_k := 2 - a_k$, so $b_k \in \{0,2\}$ and $b \ne a$. Then $\Phi(b) \in C$ and $\Phi(b) \ne \Phi(a)$ by [L2], while $\Phi(b) - \Phi(a) = \sum_{j \ge 0}(b_j - a_j)3^{-j-1} = (b_k - a_k)3^{-k-1}$ by [L2], all other terms being $0$, so $|\Phi(b) - x| = 2 \cdot 3^{-k-1} < \varepsilon$ by [L10]. Thus $N_\varepsilon(x)$ contains a point of $C$ other than $x$, for every $\varepsilon$, so $x$ is not isolated in $C$; by [L7] $C$ is perfect. [step 1.1, L2, L7, L10, L12]

2.2 **$C$ contains no nondegenerate interval and is nowhere dense, claim 5.** By step 1.2 the set $C$ is null, so by [L6] it contains no $[u,v]$ with $u < v$; in particular it contains no interval of any of the four bounded forms with distinct endpoints, since such an interval contains a closed one with distinct endpoints by [L6] and [L12]. Its interior is therefore empty: if $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq C$ for some real $\varepsilon > 0$, then $[x - \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1},\, x + \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}] \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq C$ by [L3] and [L12], an interval with distinct endpoints. Since $C$ is closed by step 1.1, it equals its closure, so [L8] gives that $C$ is nowhere dense. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L3, L6, L8, L12]

3.1 **$C$ is uncountable, claim 4.** $C$ is nonempty, since $0 \in C$ by [L1], and perfect by step 2.1, so [L7] applies. [step 2.1, L1, L7]

3.2 **Connected subsets, claim 6.** Let $E \subseteq C$ be connected and nonempty. By [L9] $E$ is order-convex, so if $u, v \in E$ with $u < v$ then $[u,v] \subseteq E \subseteq C$, contradicting step 2.2. Hence no two distinct elements of $E$ exist, and $E$, being nonempty, is a single point. [step 2.2, L9, L12]

4.1 Claims 1 to 6 are steps 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 3.1, 2.2 and 3.2 respectively, so all six hold. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, step 3.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Two independent proofs of uncountability.** The route above is [[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]] applied to a nonempty perfect set. The other is claim 3 of [[thm-cantor-set-ternary-description]]: $C$ is in bijection with $\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$, which is in bijection with the power set of $\mathbb{N}$, uncountable by [[thm-cantor-powerset]]. The two arguments share nothing, and the second is the one that makes the *size* of $C$ evident: $C$ is in bijection with the power set of $\mathbb{N}$, while having content zero. **It is deliberately not said here that $C$ has as many points as $\mathbb{R}$.** That would require a bijection between $\mathbb{R}$ and the power set of $\mathbb{N}$, and no such bijection is constructed anywhere at this point in the reading order; the two uncountability results available here are separate facts, one proved by the diagonal argument on power sets and one by nested intervals.

- **Claim 2 and claim 4 together are the point of the whole construction.** A set of measure zero may be uncountable, so nullity is not a cardinality condition; and a nowhere dense set need not be null, so it is not a category condition either ([[fs-nowhere-dense-implies-measure-zero]], [[thm-fat-cantor-set-has-positive-measure]]).

- **Why claim 5 is proved through measure and not by inspection.** The intervals making up $C_n$ have length $3^{-n}$, and one can see directly that a long interval cannot fit inside $C$. Doing that rigorously means keeping track of the $2^n$ component intervals of $C_n$ and their gaps; going through [[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]] uses the estimate already made in step 1.2 and needs no such bookkeeping.

- **Every point of $C$ is a limit of other points of $C$, and the witnesses are explicit**: change one ternary digit far out, as step 2.1 does. This is also what shows $C$ has no isolated points without any appeal to the structure of its complement.

## Statement

Let $D$ be the set of sequences $a : \mathbb{N} \to \{0,2\}$
([[def-sequence]]), the two values being the real numbers $0$ and $2$. For
$a \in D$ the series $\sum_{k \ge 0} a_k 3^{-k-1}$ converges ([[def-series]]);
write

$$\Phi(a) \;:=\; \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k 3^{-k-1} .$$

Then, with $C$ and $(C_n)$ as in [[def-cantor-set]]:

1. $\Phi(a) \in [0,1]$ for every $a \in D$, and $C = \{\, \Phi(a) : a \in D \,\}$;
2. $\Phi$ is injective, so $\Phi$ is a bijection from $D$ onto $C$
   ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]);
3. consequently $b \mapsto \Phi\big((2 b_k)_k\big)$ is a bijection from
   $\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$, the set of sequences with values in $\{0,1\}$, onto
   $C$;
4. $C = \tfrac13 C \cup \big(\tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C\big)$, and the two sets on the
   right are disjoint.

**On the indexing.** The digit $a_k$ carries the weight $3^{-k-1}$, so the
series starts at $k = 0$ with the term $a_0/3$; written with the classical
$1$-based index it reads $\sum_{k \ge 1} a_k 3^{-k}$, which is the form in the
title. Sequences in this library are functions on $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}$
contains $0$ ([[def-sequence]]), so the $0$-based form is the one used
throughout the proof.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The sets $C_n$ and $C$ of [[def-cantor-set]], the set $D$ of sequences with values in $\{0,2\}$, and for $a \in D$ the shifted sequence $\sigma a$ defined by $(\sigma a)_k := a_{k+1}$, which again lies in $D$.

[L1] The Cantor set: $C_0 = [0,1]$, $C_{n+1} = \tfrac13 C_n \cup (\tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C_n)$, $C = \bigcap_n C_n = \bigcap_n C_{n+1}$, every $C_n \subseteq [0,1]$, the two halves of $C_{n+1}$ lie in $[0,\tfrac13]$ and in $[\tfrac23,1]$ respectively and are disjoint, and $3^{-n}$ denotes $(3^{-1})^n$ ([[def-cantor-set]], [[def-interval]]).

[L2] Series: partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} t_k$, convergence of $(s_n)$, the sum as its limit, the tail clause $\sum_{k \ge m} t_k$ and the identity $\sum_{k<n+1} t_k = t_0 + \sum_{j<n} t_{j+1}$ ([[def-series]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L3] A series of nonnegative terms converges exactly when its partial sums are bounded above, its sum is then their supremum, every partial sum is at most the sum, and a convergent series of nonnegative terms has sum $\ge 0$ ([[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]]).

[L4] $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} 3^{-k} = 1/(1 - 3^{-1}) = 3 \cdot 2^{-1}$ ([[thm-geometric-series]], [[def-integer-power]], [[lem-power-laws]]).

[L5] Convergent series add and scale termwise ([[lem-series-linearity]]).

[L6] Recursion and induction on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-recursion]], [[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L7] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L8] $3^{-n} \to 0$ ([[lem-geometric-sequence-null]]); convergence is tested against rational $\varepsilon > 0$ and a convergent sequence has exactly one limit ([[def-real-limit]], [[lem-limit-unique]]); $|z| \ge 0$ and $|z| = z$ for $z \ge 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L9] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 > 0$ and $3 > 0$ and $3^{-1} > 0$, and $3^{-1} < 2 \cdot 3^{-1}$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve an inequality; the order is total and transitive ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **$\Phi$ is well defined and takes values in $[0,1]$.** For $a \in D$ every term $a_k 3^{-k-1}$ is $\ge 0$ by [L1] and [L9], and for every $n$ the partial sum satisfies $\sum_{k<n} a_k 3^{-k-1} \le \sum_{k<n} 2 \cdot 3^{-1} \cdot 3^{-k} = 2 \cdot 3^{-1} \sum_{k<n} 3^{-k} \le 2 \cdot 3^{-1} \cdot 3 \cdot 2^{-1} = 1$, by [L3], [L4] and [L9]. So by [L3] the series converges, its sum $\Phi(a)$ satisfies $0 \le \Phi(a) \le 1$, and $\Phi(a) \in [0,1]$ by [L1]. [given, L1, L3, L4, L9]

1.2 **Shift identity:** $\Phi(a) = a_0 \cdot 3^{-1} + 3^{-1}\Phi(\sigma a)$ for every $a \in D$. Indeed by [L2] the partial sums satisfy $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k 3^{-k-1} = a_0 3^{-1} + \sum_{j<n} a_{j+1} 3^{-j-2} = a_0 3^{-1} + 3^{-1}\sum_{j<n} a_{j+1}3^{-j-1}$, using $3^{-j-2} = 3^{-1}\cdot 3^{-j-1}$ from [L1] and [L9]; letting $n$ grow and using [L5] and [L2] gives the identity. [given, L1, L2, L5, L9]

1.3 **Self-similarity of $C$**, claim 4. If $y \in C$ then $y \in C_n$ for every $n$, so $y \cdot 3^{-1} \in \tfrac13 C_n \subseteq C_{n+1}$ and $2 \cdot 3^{-1} + y \cdot 3^{-1} \in \tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C_n \subseteq C_{n+1}$ for every $n$, whence both lie in $\bigcap_n C_{n+1} = C$ by [L1]; this gives the inclusion $\supseteq$. Conversely let $x \in C$, so $x \in C_{n+1}$ for every $n$. By [L1] the first half of $C_{n+1}$ lies in $[0,\tfrac13]$ and the second in $[\tfrac23,1]$, and $\tfrac13 < \tfrac23$ by [L9]. If $x \le \tfrac13$ then $x \notin [\tfrac23,1]$, so for every $n$ one has $x \in \tfrac13 C_n$, that is $3x \in C_n$; hence $3x \in C$ and $x \in \tfrac13 C$. If $x > \tfrac13$ then $x \notin [0,\tfrac13]$, so for every $n$ one has $x \in \tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C_n$, that is $3x - 2 \in C_n$; hence $3x - 2 \in C$ and $x \in \tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C$. Disjointness is [L1] and [L9], since $\tfrac13 C \subseteq [0,\tfrac13]$ and $\tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C \subseteq [\tfrac23,1]$. [L1, L9]

2.1 **$\Phi(a) \in C$ for every $a \in D$.** By induction on $n$ ([L6]) the statement "for every $a \in D$, $\Phi(a) \in C_n$" holds for every $n$: at $n = 0$ it is step 1.1 and [L1]; and if it holds at $n$, then for $a \in D$ the value $a_0$ is $0$ or $2$, so step 1.2 gives $\Phi(a) = 3^{-1}\Phi(\sigma a) \in \tfrac13 C_n$ in the first case and $\Phi(a) = 2 \cdot 3^{-1} + 3^{-1}\Phi(\sigma a) \in \tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C_n$ in the second, so $\Phi(a) \in C_{n+1}$ by [L1]. Hence $\Phi(a) \in \bigcap_n C_n = C$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1, L6]

2.2 **The digit recursion.** Fix $x \in C$ and let $T : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be $T(y) := 3y$ for $y \le 3^{-1}$ and $T(y) := 3y - 2$ for $y > 3^{-1}$, a definition by cases on the total order ([L9]) and so a genuine function. By [L6] there is $y : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with $y_0 = x$ and $y_{n+1} = T(y_n)$; put $a_n := 0$ when $y_n \le 3^{-1}$ and $a_n := 2$ otherwise, so that $a \in D$ and $y_{n+1} = 3 y_n - a_n$ for every $n$. Every $y_n$ lies in $C$, by induction on $n$: $y_0 = x \in C$; and if $y_n \in C$ then, by step 1.3, either $y_n \in \tfrac13 C \subseteq [0,\tfrac13]$ or $y_n \in \tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C \subseteq [\tfrac23,1]$, and these two cases are exactly $y_n \le \tfrac13$ and $y_n > \tfrac13$ by [L9]; in the first $y_n = z \cdot 3^{-1}$ with $z \in C$ and $y_{n+1} = 3y_n = z \in C$, in the second $y_n = 2 \cdot 3^{-1} + z \cdot 3^{-1}$ with $z \in C$ and $y_{n+1} = 3y_n - 2 = z \in C$. [step 1.3, L1, L6, L9]

2.3 **$\Phi$ is injective.** Let $a, b \in D$ with $a \ne b$; the set of $k$ with $a_k \ne b_k$ is a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$, so by [L7] it has a least element $k$, and by symmetry we may take $a_k = 0$ and $b_k = 2$. By [L5], $\Phi(b) - \Phi(a) = \sum_{j \ge 0}(b_j - a_j)3^{-j-1}$, and the terms with $j < k$ vanish, so by [L2] this equals $2 \cdot 3^{-k-1} + R$ with $R := \sum_{j \ge k+1}(b_j - a_j)3^{-j-1}$. Every $b_j - a_j$ is at least $-2$, so the series $\sum_{j \ge k+1}\big((b_j - a_j) + 2\big)3^{-j-1}$ has nonnegative terms and hence nonnegative sum by [L3], giving $R \ge -\sum_{j \ge k+1} 2 \cdot 3^{-j-1} = -2 \cdot 3^{-k-2} \cdot 3 \cdot 2^{-1} = -3^{-k-1}$ by [L2], [L4], [L5] and [L9]. Therefore $\Phi(b) - \Phi(a) \ge 2 \cdot 3^{-k-1} - 3^{-k-1} = 3^{-k-1} > 0$ and $\Phi(a) \ne \Phi(b)$. [step 1.1, L2, L3, L4, L5, L7, L9]

3.1 **The value is recovered from the digits.** With $x$, $(y_n)$ and $a$ as in step 2.2, put $s_n := \sum_{k<n} a_k 3^{-k-1}$. Then $x = s_n + 3^{-n} y_n$ for every $n$, by induction on $n$ ([L6]): at $n = 0$ both sides are $x$, since $s_0 = 0$ by [L2] and $3^{0} = 1$; and if $x = s_n + 3^{-n}y_n$ then $s_{n+1} + 3^{-n-1}y_{n+1} = s_n + a_n 3^{-n-1} + 3^{-n-1}(3y_n - a_n) = s_n + 3^{-n}y_n = x$, using [L1], [L2] and [L9]. [step 2.2, L1, L2, L6, L9]

4.1 **Hence $x = \Phi(a)$, so $C \subseteq \Phi[D]$.** Every $y_n$ lies in $C \subseteq [0,1]$ by step 2.2 and [L1], so $0 \le x - s_n = 3^{-n}y_n \le 3^{-n}$ by step 3.1 and [L9]. Given a rational $\varepsilon > 0$, [L8] supplies $N$ with $3^{-n} < \varepsilon$ for all $n \ge N$, and then $|s_n - x| = x - s_n \le 3^{-n} < \varepsilon$ by [L8]; so $s_n \to x$. But $s_n \to \Phi(a)$ by [L2], since $(s_n)$ is the sequence of partial sums of the series defining $\Phi(a)$, and limits are unique by [L8]; therefore $x = \Phi(a)$ with $a \in D$. [step 2.2, step 3.1, L1, L2, L8, L9]

5.1 By steps 2.1 and 4.1 the image of $D$ under $\Phi$ is exactly $C$, which with step 1.1 is claim 1; step 2.3 is claim 2, so $\Phi$ is a surjection from $D$ onto $C$ that is injective, that is, a bijection ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]); the map $b \mapsto (2b_k)_k$ is a bijection from $\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$ onto $D$, with inverse $a \mapsto (a_k \cdot 2^{-1})_k$ by [L9], and a composition of bijections is a bijection, which is claim 3; and step 1.3 is claim 4. [step 1.1, step 1.3, step 2.1, step 2.3, step 4.1, L9] ∎

## Remarks

- **The endpoints are the digit sequences that are eventually constant.** For
  instance $0 = \Phi(0,0,0,\dots)$, $1 = \Phi(2,2,2,\dots)$,
  $\tfrac13 = \Phi(0,2,2,2,\dots)$ and $\tfrac23 = \Phi(2,0,0,0,\dots)$, the
  first two by [[thm-geometric-series]] and the last two by the shift identity of
  step 1.2. That the eventually constant sequences do **not** exhaust $C$ is the
  content of [[cex-cantor-point-that-is-not-an-endpoint]], where $1/4$ is
  computed to be $\Phi(0,2,0,2,\dots)$.

- **No digit is ever $1$, and that is the whole point.** A real of $[0,1]$ with a
  ternary expansion using the digit $1$ at some place and not representable
  without it lies in one of the removed middle thirds. The theorem does not
  assert that every real has a ternary expansion, and it does not need to: the
  map $\Phi$ is constructed from the digits, and the converse direction extracts
  digits from a point of $C$ by the canonical recursion of step 2.2, never by
  invoking a general expansion theorem.

- **Where the choice-freeness lies.** The digit extraction is a definition by
  cases on a total order fed to [[thm-recursion]], so the whole passage from a
  point of $C$ to its digit sequence is a single function, not a sequence of
  selections. The same discipline governs [[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]] and
  [[thm-baire-category-r]].

- **Claim 3 is what makes $C$ uncountable.** $\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$ is in
  bijection with the power set of $\mathbb{N}$, which is uncountable by
  [[thm-cantor-powerset]]; that route and the perfect-set route are both recorded
  in [[thm-cantor-set-properties]].

## Statement

Let $r \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $r^k$ be the integer power ([[def-integer-power]]),
so that $r^0 = 1$ for every $r$, including $r = 0$.

1. If $|r| < 1$ then the series $\sum r^k$ converges ([[def-series]]) and
   $$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} r^{k} \;=\; \frac{1}{1-r} .$$
2. If $|r| \ge 1$ then $\sum r^k$ diverges.

The series starts at $k = 0$ and its first term is $r^0 = 1$; in particular
$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} 2^{-k} = 2$, while the series starting at $k = 1$ sums to
$1$. Which starting index is meant has to be said, and it is said here.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real number $r$, the integer powers $r^k$ ([[def-integer-power]]), and the partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} r^k$ of $\sum r^k$ ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[L1] Factorisation of a difference of powers: for $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and natural $n \ge 1$, $b^n - a^n = (b-a)\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a^k b^{\,n-1-k}$ ([[lem-power-difference-factorisation]]).

[L2] For $|r| < 1$ the sequence $(r^k)$ is null, that is $r^k \to 0$ ([[lem-geometric-sequence-null]]).

[L3] Algebra of limits: sums, differences and quotients of convergent sequences converge to the corresponding combination, the quotient rule requiring a nonzero limit and nonzero denominators ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L4] Absolute value: $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$, $|x| \ge 0$, and $|x| = 0$ exactly when $x = 0$; also $|1| = 1$, since $1 > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L5] Powers and order: $a^0 = 1$ for every $a$; if $a \ge 1$ and $n \ge 1$ then $a^n \ge a \ge 1$; and $1^n = 1$ for every $n$ ([[lem-power-monotone]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L6] The principle of induction ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L7] If a series converges then its terms tend to $0$ ([[lem-nth-term-test]]).

[L8] Notation of [[def-finite-sum]]: $\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x_k$ is $\sum_{k<n} x_k$, and the empty sum $\sum_{k<0} x_k$ is $0$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Assume $|r| < 1$. [assume-case lt]

1.2 Assume instead $|r| \ge 1$. [assume-case ge]

1.3 For every natural $n \ge 1$, applying [L1] with $b = 1$ and $a = r$ gives $1 - r^n = (1-r)\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} r^k \cdot 1^{\,n-1-k} = (1-r)\,s_n$, using $1^m = 1$ and the notation of [L8]. [L1, L5, L8]

1.4 At $n = 0$ the identity $1 - r^n = (1-r)s_n$ also holds, both sides being $0$ because $r^0 = 1$ and $s_0$ is the empty sum. [L5, L8]

2.1 In the case $|r| < 1$ we have $r \ne 1$, since $|1| = 1$ and $|r| < 1$; hence $1 - r \ne 0$. [step 1.1, L4, algebra]

2.2 In the case $|r| \ge 1$, an induction gives $|r^k| = |r|^k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$: at $k = 0$ both sides are $1$, and if $|r^k| = |r|^k$ then $|r^{k+1}| = |r^k \cdot r| = |r^k|\,|r| = |r|^k |r| = |r|^{k+1}$. [step 1.2, L4, L5, L6]

2.3 In the case $|r| \ge 1$ we get $|r|^k \ge 1$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$: at $k = 0$ this reads $1 \ge 1$, and for $k \ge 1$ it is the comparison $|r|^k \ge |r| \ge 1$. [step 1.2, L5]

3.1 In the case $|r| < 1$, dividing by $1 - r \ne 0$ gives $s_n = (1 - r^n)/(1-r)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.1, step 1.3, step 1.4, algebra]

3.2 In the case $|r| \ge 1$, combining the two previous steps gives $|r^k - 0| = |r^k| = |r|^k \ge 1$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.2, step 2.3]

4.1 In the case $|r| < 1$ the sequence $(r^n)$ is null, so $1 - r^n \to 1$ and therefore $s_n \to 1/(1-r)$, the denominator being the nonzero constant $1-r$; hence $\sum r^k$ converges with sum $1/(1-r)$, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 3.1, step 2.1, L2, L3]

4.2 In the case $|r| \ge 1$ the sequence $(r^k)$ does not converge to $0$, since the rational tolerance $\varepsilon = 1$ admits no index $K$ with $|r^k - 0| < 1$ for all $k \ge K$; so by the term test $\sum r^k$ diverges, which is claim 2. [step 3.2, L7]

5.1 The two cases $|r| < 1$ and $|r| \ge 1$ exhaust the possibilities, since the order on $\mathbb{R}$ is total, so claims 1 and 2 together cover every real $r$. [step 4.1, step 4.2, cases-exhaustive] ∎

## Remarks

- **The divergence half needs no separate treatment of $r = 1$ and $r = -1$.** Both are covered by $|r| \ge 1$, and the single reason is the same in every case: the terms have absolute value at least $1$, so they cannot tend to $0$. For $r = 1$ the partial sums are $s_n = n$ and run to $+\infty$; for $r = -1$ they oscillate between $0$ and $1$. The theorem says only that neither converges, which is all that "diverges" means here ([[def-series]]).

- **Why the identity is proved at $n = 0$ separately.** [[lem-power-difference-factorisation]] requires $n \ge 1$, since its right-hand side is a sum over $k < n$ of a term involving $b^{\,n-1-k}$, and $n-1$ is not a natural number at $n = 0$. The identity is still true at $n = 0$, but by inspection of two empty objects rather than by that lemma, and step 1.4 says so rather than letting the reader assume the citation covers it.

## Statement

Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals with $a_k \ge 0$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$,
let $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ be its partial sums and let
$S = \{\, s_n : n \in \mathbb{N} \,\}$ be the range of $(s_n)$ ([[def-series]]).
Then:

1. $(s_n)$ is nondecreasing ([[def-monotone-sequence]]) and $s_n \ge 0$ for every
   $n$;
2. $\sum a_k$ converges **if and only if** $S$ is bounded above
   ([[def-bounded-set]]), and in that case
   $$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k \;=\; \sup S ,$$
   so in particular $s_n \le \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k$ for every $n$;
3. if $S$ is not bounded above then $s_n \to +\infty$
   ([[def-divergence-to-infinity]]) and $\sum a_k$ diverges.

This is the theorem that makes the nonnegative theory work: for terms of one
sign, convergence is a boundedness question and no candidate limit is ever
needed. Every comparison test on this page is an application of it.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(a_k)$ of reals with $a_k \ge 0$ for every $k$, its partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$, and the range $S = \{s_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L1] The recursion clause of the finite sum: $s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ ([[def-finite-sum]]).

[L2] Consecutive comparisons suffice for monotonicity: $(x_k)$ is nondecreasing if and only if $x_k \le x_{k+1}$ for every $k$; and a nondecreasing sequence is bounded below by its first term ([[def-monotone-sequence]]).

[L3] Monotonicity of finite sums: if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L4] A monotone sequence converges if and only if it is bounded, that is if and only if there is $M$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for every $k$ ([[cor-monotone-converges-iff-bounded]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L5] A nondecreasing sequence bounded above converges to the supremum of its range, which exists by the least-upper-bound property ([[thm-monotone-convergence]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L6] A nondecreasing sequence whose range is not bounded above diverges to $+\infty$ ([[lem-monotone-unbounded-diverges]], [[def-divergence-to-infinity]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For every $n$, $s_{n+1} - s_n = a_n \ge 0$, so $s_n \le s_{n+1}$ and $(s_n)$ is nondecreasing. [given, L1, L2]

1.2 For every $n$, $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, all terms being nonnegative. [given, L3]

2.1 Claim 1 is steps 1.1 and 1.2 together. [step 1.1, step 1.2]

2.2 Since $s_n \ge 0$ we have $|s_n| = s_n$, so $(s_n)$ is bounded in the sense of [L4] if and only if $S$ is bounded above. [step 1.2, L4]

3.1 By [L4] applied to the monotone sequence $(s_n)$, the series converges if and only if $(s_n)$ is bounded, hence if and only if $S$ is bounded above. [step 1.1, step 2.2, L4]

4.1 If $S$ is bounded above then $(s_n)$ converges to $\sup S$, so $\sum a_k$ converges with sum $\sup S$; and since $\sup S$ is an upper bound of $S$, $s_n \le \sup S$ for every $n$. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L5]

4.2 If $S$ is not bounded above then $s_n \to +\infty$, and by step 3.1 the series diverges. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L6]

5.1 The equivalence and the identification of the sum as the supremum together make claim 2, and the divergence statement is claim 3. [step 3.1, step 4.1, step 4.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **"Bounded" and "bounded above" coincide here, and only here.** The equivalence used in step 2.2 rests on $s_n \ge 0$, which rests on every term being nonnegative. For a series with terms of both signs the partial sums can be bounded above and still fail to converge, so nothing in this theorem survives the loss of the sign hypothesis. That failure is exhibited by [[cex-comparison-needs-nonnegativity]] on the companion page.

- **Claim 3 is a strictly stronger statement than "diverges".** Divergence alone permits oscillation ([[def-series]]); for nonnegative terms it cannot occur, and the partial sums necessarily run to $+\infty$. This is what licenses the phrase "the series diverges to $+\infty$" for nonnegative terms, and it is what the Abel-Dini theorem later on this page uses.

- **This criterion is the monotone convergence property, worn differently.** The proof above is monotone convergence for $\mathbb{R}$ applied to the nondecreasing sequence of partial sums, and nothing is lost going back the other way. Given a nondecreasing sequence $(x_n)$ of reals, put $y_n := x_n - x_0 \ge 0$ and let $a_0 := 0$, $a_{k+1} := y_{k+1} - y_k \ge 0$; then $s_{n+1} = y_n$ ([[def-series]]), the partial sums are bounded exactly when $(x_n)$ is bounded above, and claim 1 returns the convergence of $(y_n)$ and so of $(x_n)$. Testing boundedness of partial sums is therefore not a device special to series. Read in the vocabulary of [[def-completeness-properties]] it is the property (MCT), which in an arbitrary ordered field already forces the Archimedean property on its own ([[lem-mct-implies-archimedean]]) and with it the least-upper-bound property ([[lem-mct-implies-lub]]). The translation just given is carried out in $\mathbb{R}$, since [[def-series]] is stated for sequences of reals and this library defines no series over a general ordered field.
