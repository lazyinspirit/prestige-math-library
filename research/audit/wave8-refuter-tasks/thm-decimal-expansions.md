## Statement

Let $b \in \mathbb{N}$ with $b \ge 2$ and write $\beta := \iota(b)$ for the
canonical natural of $b$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-canonical-natural]]), so that
$\beta > 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]); powers $\beta^{\,n}$ are integer
powers ([[def-integer-power]]). Call a sequence $(d_j)$ of natural numbers a
**digit sequence in base $b$** when $d_j < b$ for every $j$, and say it is
**terminal** when it is eventually constantly $b-1$, that is when there is $J$
with $d_j = b-1$ for every $j \ge J$. Then:

1. **Existence.** For every $x \in [0,1)$ ([[def-interval]]) there is a
   non-terminal digit sequence $(d_j)$ in base $b$ with
   $$\sum_{j \ge 0} \frac{\iota(d_j)}{\beta^{\,j+1}} \ \text{ convergent, of sum } \ x .$$
2. **Uniqueness.** If $(c_j)$ and $(c'_j)$ are non-terminal digit sequences in
   base $b$ whose series have the same sum, then $c_j = c'_j$ for every $j$.

So every real in $[0,1)$ has exactly one base-$b$ expansion once the terminal
sequences are excluded. The assignment $x \mapsto (d_j)$ is moreover a bijection
onto the non-terminal digit sequences: claim 2 makes it injective, and it is onto
because a non-terminal $(c_j)$ has $\iota(c_j) \le \beta - 1$ for every $j$ and
$\iota(c_j) < \beta - 1$ for infinitely many $j$, so its sum is strictly below the
sum $1$ of the all-$(b-1)$ series computed in step 8.1, hence lies in $[0,1)$ and
has $(c_j)$ as its expansion by claim 2. Excluding them is unavoidable: the terminal
sequences are exactly the ones producing a second expansion of a number that
already has one, as the companion examples page exhibits with
$0.999\dots = 1$ and $0.4999\dots = 0.5$.

**The construction uses no floor function.** The integer part of a real is not
available at this point in the reading order, so the digit at each stage is
produced by the finite case distinction "in which of the $b$ intervals
$[\,d/\beta,\ (d+1)/\beta\,)$ does the current residue lie", closed by the
well-ordering principle ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]), and the digits are
assembled by the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]).

**Indices run from $0$.** The digit $d_j$ carries the weight $\beta^{-(j+1)}$, so
that the first digit has weight $1/\beta$ and no denominator $\beta^{\,0} = 1$
ever occurs.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural number $b \ge 2$, $\beta = \iota(b)$, and a real $x \in [0,1)$.

[L1] The canonical natural: $\iota(0) = 0$, $\iota(n+1) = \iota(n) + 1$, $\iota$ is strictly increasing on $\mathbb{N}$, and $\iota(m+n) = \iota(m) + \iota(n)$ ([[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L2] Integer powers: $\beta^0 = 1$, $\beta^{n+1} = \beta^{\,n}\beta$, $(uv)^n = u^n v^n$, and $\beta^{\,n} > 0$ for $\beta > 0$ ([[def-integer-power]], [[lem-power-laws]]).

[L3] $[0,1) = \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : 0 \le y < 1 \,\}$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L4] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L5] The recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) and the principle of induction ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L6] Geometric series: for $|r| < 1$, $\sum r^k$ converges with sum $1/(1-r)$; and the terms of a convergent series tend to $0$ ([[thm-geometric-series]], [[lem-nth-term-test]]).

[L7] Order and inverses: $0 < u < v$ implies $0 < 1/v < 1/u$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

[L8] Finite sums: recursion, splitting, additivity, scaling and monotonicity; in particular every single term of a finite sum of nonnegative reals is at most that sum ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L9] Partial sums and sums of series; linearity of convergent series; and a series converges if and only if some tail series converges, the sum being the initial partial sum plus the tail sum ([[def-series]], [[lem-series-linearity]], [[lem-series-tail-invariance]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L10] For a series of nonnegative terms, every partial sum is at most the sum ([[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]]).

[L11] The squeeze theorem, the algebra of limits, and that limits preserve non-strict inequalities ([[thm-squeeze]], [[thm-algebra-of-limits]], [[lem-limit-preserves-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 $\beta = \iota(b) \ge \iota(2) = 1 + 1 > 1 > 0$, and an induction gives $\beta^{\,n} > 0$ for every $n$; also $0 < 1/\beta < 1$. [given, L1, L2, L5, L7]

1.2 For uniqueness, let $(c_j)$ and $(c'_j)$ be non-terminal digit sequences whose series have the same sum, and suppose they are not equal. By [L4] let $n$ be least with $c_n \ne c'_n$; interchanging the two sequences if necessary, assume $c_n < c'_n$, so $\iota(c'_n) - \iota(c_n) \ge 1$. [given, L1, L4, choose]

2.1 **The digit of a residue.** For every $r \in [0,1)$ there is exactly one natural $d < b$ with $\iota(d)/\beta \le r < \iota(d+1)/\beta$. For existence, the set $D := \{\, d \in \mathbb{N} : d \le b \text{ and } r < \iota(d)/\beta \,\}$ contains $b$, since $\iota(b)/\beta = 1 > r$; let $m := \min D$, which is not $0$ because $\iota(0)/\beta = 0 \le r$; put $d := m - 1$, so $d < b$, and minimality of $m$ says $d \notin D$, that is $\iota(d)/\beta \le r$, while $m \in D$ says $r < \iota(m)/\beta = \iota(d+1)/\beta$. For uniqueness, if $d < d'$ both worked then $r < \iota(d+1)/\beta \le \iota(d')/\beta \le r$, which the order forbids. Write $d(r)$ for this digit. [step 1.1, L1, L3, L4, construct]

2.2 Both series converge, by hypothesis, so by linearity $\sum_j \bigl(\iota(c'_j) - \iota(c_j)\bigr)/\beta^{\,j+1}$ converges with sum $0$; its first $n$ terms vanish, so by [L9] the tail from $n$ also has sum $0$, that is $0 = \bigl(\iota(c'_n)-\iota(c_n)\bigr)/\beta^{\,n+1} + \sum_{j > n}\bigl(\iota(c'_j)-\iota(c_j)\bigr)/\beta^{\,j+1}$. [given, step 1.2, L9]

3.1 **The residue map.** For $r \in [0,1)$ put $f(r) := \beta r - \iota(d(r))$. Multiplying $\iota(d(r))/\beta \le r < \iota(d(r)+1)/\beta = (\iota(d(r)) + 1)/\beta$ by $\beta > 0$ gives $\iota(d(r)) \le \beta r < \iota(d(r)) + 1$, so $0 \le f(r) < 1$; thus $f$ is a function from $[0,1)$ to $[0,1)$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L1, L3, construct]

3.2 Every difference satisfies $\iota(c'_j) - \iota(c_j) \ge -(\beta - 1)$, the digits lying in $\{0,\dots,b-1\}$, and $\sum_{j>n}(\beta-1)/\beta^{\,j+1} = \frac{\beta-1}{\beta^{\,n+2}}\cdot\frac{1}{1-1/\beta} = \frac{1}{\beta^{\,n+1}}$ by the geometric series; hence the tail in step 2.2 is at least $-1/\beta^{\,n+1}$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L6, L11]

4.1 By the recursion theorem applied to the set $[0,1)$, the element $x$ and the function $f$, there is a unique sequence $(r_n)$ in $[0,1)$ with $r_0 = x$ and $r_{n+1} = f(r_n)$; put $d_j := d(r_j)$, a natural number $< b$, so $(d_j)$ is a digit sequence in base $b$. [step 3.1, L5, construct]

4.2 Write $A$ for the first summand and $B$ for the tail in step 2.2, so $A + B = 0$ while $A \ge 1/\beta^{\,n+1}$ by step 1.2 and $B \ge -1/\beta^{\,n+1}$ by step 3.2; since the two lower bounds sum to $0$, both must be attained, that is $A = 1/\beta^{\,n+1}$ and $B = -1/\beta^{\,n+1}$; in particular $\sum_{j>n}\bigl(\iota(c'_j)-\iota(c_j) + (\beta-1)\bigr)/\beta^{\,j+1} = 0$, a convergent series of nonnegative terms with sum $0$, so every term is $0$ and $\iota(c'_j) - \iota(c_j) = -(\beta-1)$ for every $j > n$. [step 1.2, step 2.2, step 3.2, L8, L9, L10]

5.1 An induction gives $x = \sum_{j<n} \iota(d_j)/\beta^{\,j+1} + r_n/\beta^{\,n}$ for every $n$: at $n = 0$ the sum is empty and $r_0/\beta^0 = x$; and from $r_n = (\iota(d_n) + r_{n+1})/\beta$, which is step 3.1 rearranged, one gets $r_n/\beta^{\,n} = \iota(d_n)/\beta^{\,n+1} + r_{n+1}/\beta^{\,n+1}$. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L2, L5, L8]

5.2 Since $0 \le r_n < 1$ and $\beta^{\,n} > 0$, we have $0 \le r_n/\beta^{\,n} \le 1/\beta^{\,n} = (1/\beta)^n$; as $0 < 1/\beta < 1$ the series $\sum (1/\beta)^k$ converges, so $(1/\beta)^n \to 0$, and the squeeze gives $r_n/\beta^{\,n} \to 0$. [step 1.1, step 4.1, L2, L6, L7, L11]

5.3 That forces $c_j = b-1$ and $c'_j = 0$ for every $j > n$, since the difference of two digits attains $-(\beta-1)$ only at those values; so $(c_j)$ is terminal, contrary to hypothesis. Hence the two digit sequences agree, which is claim 2. [step 1.2, step 4.2, L1]

6.1 By step 5.1 the partial sums of $\sum_j \iota(d_j)/\beta^{\,j+1}$ equal $x - r_n/\beta^{\,n}$, which converges to $x$; so the series converges with sum $x$. [step 5.1, step 5.2, L9, L11]

7.1 Applying step 5.1 and step 6.1 to the residue $r_J$ in place of $x$, whose recursion produces the digits $d_{J+i}$, gives $r_J = \sum_{i \ge 0} \iota(d_{J+i})/\beta^{\,i+1}$ for every $J$. [step 4.1, step 6.1, L5]

8.1 The constructed sequence is not terminal: if $d_j = b-1$ for every $j \ge J$, then by step 7.1 and the geometric series, $r_J = \sum_{i\ge0} (\beta-1)/\beta^{\,i+1} = \frac{\beta-1}{\beta}\cdot\frac{1}{1 - 1/\beta} = 1$, contradicting $r_J < 1$; here $\iota(b-1) = \beta - 1$ by [L1]. With step 6.1 this proves claim 1. [step 6.1, step 7.1, L1, L2, L6, L9]

9.1 Claim 1 is step 6.1 with step 8.1 and claim 2 is step 5.3, so every $x \in [0,1)$ has exactly one non-terminal base-$b$ expansion. [step 6.1, step 8.1, step 5.3, discharge-construct] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where each tool is used, and the floor function is not among them.** The well-ordering principle appears once, in step 2.1, to pick out the digit from the finitely many candidates $0, \dots, b$; the recursion theorem appears once, in step 4.1, to turn the one-step residue map into a sequence. Everything else is the geometric series and the ordering of $\mathbb{R}$. The usual formula $d_n = \lfloor \beta r_n \rfloor$ would need the integer part of a real, which is developed later in the reading order.

- **The exclusion of terminal sequences is exactly one equivalence class.** Step 4.2 shows that two distinct expansions of the same number must differ by one at the first place where they differ and then be all $b-1$ against all $0$. So each real in $(0,1)$ whose expansion terminates in zeros has exactly two expansions and every other real exactly one; forbidding the all-$(b-1)$ tails picks one from each pair.

- **The hypothesis $x < 1$ is not a restriction on the theorem so much as on the notation.** The all-$(b-1)$ sequence sums to $1$, as step 8.1 computes, and $1$ is not in $[0,1)$; a base-$b$ expansion of a general nonnegative real is an integer part together with an expansion of the fractional part, and the integer part is not available here.

## Definition

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]) with additive identity $0_F$ and
multiplicative identity $1_F$. Define
$\iota : \mathbb{N} \to F$ by recursion on $\mathbb{N}$
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[thm-recursion]]):

$$\iota(0) \;:=\; 0_F, \qquad \iota(n+1) \;:=\; \iota(n) + 1_F .$$

$\iota(n)$ is the **canonical natural** of $n$ in $F$. It is also written
$n \cdot 1_F$, and for $n \ge 1$ it is $1_F$ added to itself $n$ times.

**Why the notation is needed at all.** A natural number in this library is a von
Neumann natural, that is a set ([[def-natural-numbers]]), and a set is not an
element of $F$. So $1/n$, $n^{\alpha}$ and $x/n$ are not expressions of $F$ when
$n$ is a natural: what they mean is $1/\iota(n)$, $\iota(n)^{\alpha}$ and
$x/\iota(n)$. The map $\iota$ is what carries a counting number into the field,
and writing it is the whole reason a reader meets $1/\iota(k+1)$ where an
informal text would write $1/(k+1)$.

## Remarks

- **Where the index shift comes from.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
  ([[def-natural-numbers]]) and $\iota(0) = 0_F$, so $1/\iota(k)$ is undefined at
  $k = 0$. A family of reciprocals indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ is therefore written
  over $\iota(k+1)$, which is why the harmonic and telescoping families of this
  library run over $k+1$ rather than over $k$. This is bookkeeping, not a
  restriction: the values are the usual ones.

- **This definition records notation; the arithmetic is proved elsewhere.** That
  $\iota$ is strictly increasing and positive on $n \ge 1$, and that it carries
  sums to sums and products to products, is [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], stated
  for an ordered field. That lemma introduces the same element by the equivalent
  recursion $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, which
  agrees with the definition above because $\iota(1) = \iota(0) + 1_F = 1_F$.
  Nothing here is new mathematics; the definition exists so that the notation has
  a home a reader can look up.

- **The symbol $\iota$ is used in this library for other canonical maps, and this
  definition does not govern them.** It also denotes the canonical field
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to F$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), the isometric
  embedding of a metric space into a completion ([[def-metric-completion]]), and
  an inclusion map $\iota : S \to X$ of a subspace. Each of those is introduced
  where it is used and means something different from the map defined here. What
  the four share is only that each is the canonical map of its situation.

- **Fields, not just ordered fields.** The recursion needs no order, so the
  definition is stated for a field; every use in this library is in an ordered
  field, and the order is what makes $\iota$ injective
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). In a field of positive characteristic $\iota$
  is not injective, which is one reason the injectivity is a lemma rather than
  part of the definition.

## Definition

Let $a \in \mathbb{R}$, where $\mathbb{R}$ is the ambient ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]).

**Natural exponents.** By the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) applied to
the set $\mathbb{R}$, the starting element $1$ and the function
$f(x) = x \cdot a$, there is a unique function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$,
written $n \mapsto a^n$, with

$$a^0 = 1, \qquad a^{n+1} = a^n \cdot a \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Thus $a^1 = a$, $a^2 = a \cdot a$, and so on. Note that this is defined for
**every** $a$, including $a = 0$.

**Negative exponents.** If $a \ne 0$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, set

$$a^{-n} := (a^n)^{-1}.$$

**Why that is legitimate.** The right-hand side presupposes that $a^n$ is
invertible, that is, that $a^n \ne 0$. This is a proof obligation and not an
observation, and it is discharged by claim 2 of [[lem-power-laws]]: for $a \ne 0$
in a field, $a^n \ne 0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, proved there by induction on
$n$ from the fact that a field has no zero divisors ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]).
That lemma is a statement *about* the operation introduced here, so it depends on
this definition and is recorded in this item's `justified_by` rather than in its
`deps` (SCHEMA §3). Given $a^n \ne 0$, the value $(a^n)^{-1}$ is a single
well-determined element, because multiplicative inverses in a field are unique
([[lem-of-inverse-unique]]).

**Integer exponents.** Every integer $m$ ([[def-integers]]) is either
$\iota(n)$ or $-\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$, where $\iota$ is the
embedding $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]],
[[def-int-operations]]). This too is a citation and not a slogan: the order on
$\mathbb{Z}$ is total ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), so $m \ge 0$ or $m < 0$; the
image of $\iota$ is exactly the set of nonnegative integers, and each of them is
$\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]); and if $m < 0$ then
$-m > 0$, by compatibility of the order with addition ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]),
so $-m = \iota(n)$ and $m = -\iota(n)$, with $n$ unique because $\iota$ is
injective. The two clauses above therefore define $a^m$ for every
$m \in \mathbb{Z}$ whenever $a \ne 0$, and for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$ for
arbitrary $a$. The clauses are consistent where they overlap: the only overlap is
$m = 0$, where $-\iota(0) = \iota(0)$ and $(a^0)^{-1} = 1^{-1} = 1 = a^0$.

## Remarks

- **The convention $0^0 = 1$ is adopted here**, and it is not a matter of taste
  but of agreement with the recursion above: $a^0 = 1$ is the starting value for
  every $a$, exactly as the empty product is $1$ ([[def-finite-sum]]). This is
  the convention that makes the empty product, the binomial theorem, and
  polynomial notation $\sum_k c_k x^k$ work at $x = 0$ without an exception. The
  competing convention "$0^0$ undefined" belongs to contexts where $x^y$ is
  studied as a function of two *real* variables and one wants continuity, which
  is unavailable and irrelevant here: the exponent in $a^m$ is an integer, never
  a real.
- $0^n = 0$ for every $n \ge 1$, since $0^{n} = 0^{n-1} \cdot 0 = 0$, a product
  with a zero factor ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]); and
  $0^{-n}$ is not defined for $n \ge 1$, since $0$ has no inverse.
- The exponent is an integer and stays an integer. Rational exponents are a
  separate construction resting on the existence of roots
  ([[thm-nth-roots-exist]], [[def-rational-power]]), and real exponents do not
  exist in this library yet ([[rem-real-exponents-deferred]]).
- The laws $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$ are
  proved, not assumed, in [[lem-power-laws]]; the order behaviour of $a \mapsto a^n$
  is [[lem-power-monotone]].

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-real-numbers]]) and
a **sequence of reals** is a function $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$
([[def-sequence]]), written $(a_k)$; recall that $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$.

**Partial sums.** Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals. Its **sequence of partial
sums** is

$$s_n \;:=\; \sum_{k < n} a_k \qquad (n \in \mathbb{N}),$$

the finite sum of [[def-finite-sum]]. In particular $s_0 = 0$, the empty sum, and
$s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ for every $n$, those being exactly the two recursion clauses
that define the finite sum. Note that $s_n$ is the sum of the $n$ terms
$a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$, so the index $n$ counts terms rather than naming the last
one.

**Convergence, the sum, divergence.** The **series** of $(a_k)$, written
$\sum a_k$, **converges** when the sequence $(s_n)$ of partial sums converges
([[def-real-limit]]), and then the **sum of the series** is

$$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k \;:=\; \lim_{n} s_n .$$

The series **diverges** when $(s_n)$ does not converge. A convergent sequence of
reals has exactly one limit ([[lem-limit-unique]]), so the displayed symbol names
a single real number and nothing further has to be checked for it to be
well defined.

**Series with a general starting index.** Let $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $a$ be a
function on $\{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : k \ge m \,\}$, which we call a **family from
$m$** and write $(a_k)_{k \ge m}$. The series

$$\sum_{k \ge m} a_k$$

is by definition the series of the sequence $b_j := a_{j + m}$,
$j \in \mathbb{N}$, which is a genuine sequence of reals; it converges exactly
when that series converges, and its sum is then written
$\sum_{k = m}^{\infty} a_k$. Its partial sums are

$$\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k \;=\; \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j} \qquad (n \ge m),$$

in the notation of [[def-finite-sum]], the value at $n = m$ being the empty sum
$0$. A sequence on $\mathbb{N}$ is the case $m = 0$, and the two readings of
$\sum a_k$ agree there, since $b_j = a_j$.

**This clause is not a convenience.** Sequences in this library are functions on
$\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$ ([[def-sequence]]), while many of the
classical series are built from expressions that are undefined at the index $0$:
$1/k$, $1/k^{p}$ and $|a_k|^{1/k}$ all require $k \ge 1$. Writing such a series as
$\sum_{k \ge 1} a_k$ names an honest object, whereas writing it as a sequence on
$\mathbb{N}$ would require a value at an index where the defining expression has
none. Every statement on this page says which starting index it uses.

**Tail series.** For $N \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$N$-th tail series** of
$\sum a_k$ is $\sum_{k \ge N} a_k$, that is the series of the $N$-th tail
$a^{(N)}$ of [[def-sequence]], whose terms are $a^{(N)}_j = a_{j+N}$. The
$0$-th tail series is the series itself.

## Remarks

- **"Diverges" here means "does not converge", and nothing more.** A divergent
  series may have partial sums that run away to $+\infty$, or to $-\infty$, or
  that oscillate without settling anywhere. The three behaviours are not
  distinguished by the word, and no statement on this page uses "diverges" to
  mean "the partial sums are unbounded" unless it says so.

- **The symbol $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k$ is defined only for a convergent
  series.** It denotes a real number, not a formal object, and it is illegitimate
  to write it down before convergence has been established. Where a proof needs
  to speak of the series without knowing whether it converges, it speaks of
  $(a_k)$ and of $(s_n)$.

- **Two indices, doing different work.** The index $k$ runs over the terms and is
  bound; the index $n$ runs over the partial sums and is the variable in which the
  limit is taken. Confusing them is the commonest slip in the subject, and it is
  the reason the definition above fixes $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ rather than
  $\sum_{k \le n} a_k$: with this choice the recursion $s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ is
  the one supplied by [[def-finite-sum]], with no shift anywhere.

## Statement

Let $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be sequences of reals, let
$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, and let $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, with finite sums and
finite products as in [[def-finite-sum]]. Then:

1. **Additivity.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k$.
2. **Scaling.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k$; in particular $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda = n\lambda$, where $n$ denotes the canonical natural $\iota(n) \in \mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).
3. **Splitting.** If $m \le n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k$, and $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n} a_k = \Big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k\Big)$.
4. **Monotonicity.** If $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$. In particular, if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, every single term satisfies $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$ for $j < n$, and $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ forces $a_k = 0$ for every $k < n$.
5. **Telescoping.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}\big(c_{k+1} - c_k\big) = c_n - c_0$.
6. **Products.** $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k) = \Big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\Big)$; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, and if $a_k > 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k > 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\lambda$, and naturals $m, n$. Write $\Sigma_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\Pi_n = \prod_{k<n} a_k$.

[L1] Recursion clauses ([[def-finite-sum]]): $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ and $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n$; $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1$ and $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) \cdot a_n$; and $\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k = \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j}$ for $m \le n$, likewise for products.

[L2] Field axioms: addition and multiplication are associative and commutative, $0$ and $1$ are the identities, $x - x = 0$, and multiplication distributes over addition ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]); and $0 \cdot x = 0$, which is not an axiom but a lemma ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

[L3] Induction principle: a property holding at $0$ and inherited by successors holds at every natural ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L4] Adding inequalities: $x \le y$ and $u \le v$ imply $x + u \le y + v$. [[lem-of-add-order]] states the STRICT forms and only those ($x < y \Rightarrow x + c < y + c$, and $x < y$ with $u < v$ giving $x + u < y + v$); the nonstrict form used throughout below is those two together with the cases $x = y$ and $u = v$, which are settled by trichotomy, the order being total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] The canonical embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a field homomorphism, so $\iota(0) = 0$ and $\iota(n+1) = \iota(n) + 1$, and $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L6] Sign rules: a product of two positives is positive ([[lem-of-sign-rules]], claim 1), and a product of two nonnegatives is nonnegative, since a factor equal to $0$ makes the product $0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]) and otherwise both factors are positive; and $1 > 0$, which is proved in [[cor-of-one-positive]] and stated by none of the items named above.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 0$: every claim holds at $n = 0$, since both sides of claim 1 are $0 = 0 + 0$, both sides of claim 2 are $0 = \lambda \cdot 0$ and $0 = \iota(0)\lambda$, claim 4 reads $0 \le 0$ with no term to bound and the hypothesis $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ giving nothing to prove, claim 5 reads $0 = c_0 - c_0$, and claim 6 reads $1 = 1 \cdot 1$ with $1 > 0$. [base, L1, L2, L5, L6]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for this $n$ and for all sequences $a, b, c$ and all $\lambda$. [ih]

1.3 Splitting, claim 3, by a separate induction on the number of trailing terms $d = n - m$ with $m$ fixed: for $d = 0$ the claim reads $\sum_{k<m} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + 0$ and $\prod_{k<m} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\big) \cdot 1$, which hold; and if $\sum_{k<m+d} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d} a_{m+j}$, then $\sum_{k<m+d+1} a_k = \sum_{k<m+d} a_k + a_{m+d} = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \big(\sum_{j<d} a_{m+j} + a_{m+d}\big) = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d+1} a_{m+j}$ by associativity, and identically for products with $1$ in place of $0$ and multiplication in place of addition, so induction on $d$ gives claim 3 for every $m \le n$. [L1, L2, L3]

2.1 Additivity at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k\big) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) + \big(\sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n\big) = \sum_{k<n+1} a_k + \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$, using the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of addition. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Scaling at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda a_k = \sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda\big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) = \lambda \sum_{k<n+1} a_k$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and distributivity; taking $a_k = 1$ for all $k$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda = \sum_{k<n} \lambda + \lambda = \iota(n)\lambda + \lambda = (\iota(n) + 1)\lambda = \iota(n+1)\lambda$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L5]

2.3 Monotonicity at $n+1$: assume $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n+1$; then $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$, so the hypothesis gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$, and adding the inequality $a_n \le b_n$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n \le \sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n = \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$. [step 1.2, L1, L4]

2.4 Telescoping at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(c_{k+1} - c_k) = \sum_{k<n}(c_{k+1} - c_k) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = (c_n - c_0) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = c_{n+1} - c_0$, by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and the field identities. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.5 Products at $n+1$: $\prod_{k<n+1}(a_k b_k) = \big(\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k)\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n+1} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n+1} b_k\big)$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of multiplication; and if every $a_k \ge 0$ for $k < n+1$ then $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) a_n$ is a product of two nonnegatives, hence nonnegative, with the same argument giving positivity from positivity since $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1 > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L6]

3.1 Consequences of monotonicity, completing claim 4: monotonicity itself holds at every $n$, by the induction principle applied to the base case of step 1.1 and the successor step 2.3, so it is available for an arbitrary $n$ in what follows; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then comparing with the zero sequence gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge \sum_{k<n} 0 = 0$; for $j < n$ splitting at $j$ and then at $j+1$ writes $\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<j} a_k + a_j + \sum_{k=j+1}^{n-1} a_k$ with the first and third summands $\ge 0$, so $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$; and if moreover $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ then $0 \le a_j \le 0$ for every $j < n$, so $a_j = 0$. [step 1.1, step 2.3, step 1.3, L3, L4, L2]

4.1 By the induction principle claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and claim 3 was proved in step 1.3 with its consequences in step 3.1, so all six laws hold. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, step 2.5, step 1.3, step 3.1, L3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ be sequences of reals ([[def-sequence]]) converging to
$x$ and $y$ respectively ([[def-real-limit]]). If $x_k \le y_k$ eventually, that
is for all $k$ from some index on, then

$$\lim_{k} x_k \;\le\; \lim_{k} y_k .$$

In particular, if $x_k \ge 0$ eventually then $\lim_k x_k \ge 0$, and if
$a \le x_k \le b$ eventually then $a \le \lim_k x_k \le b$.

The conclusion is **not** strict, and cannot be made strict; see the remarks
below and the false statement at the end of this page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $(x_k)$, $(y_k)$ of reals with $(x_k)$ converging to $x$, $(y_k)$ converging to $y$, and an index $K_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ with $x_k \le y_k$ for every $k \ge K_0$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]). Write $z_k := y_k - x_k$ and $z := y - x$.

[L1] Convergence, quantified over rational $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-real-limit]]).

[L2] Difference rule: $(z_k) = (y_k - x_k)$ converges to $y - x = z$ ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]]).

[L3] Small rationals: for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, by density ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) or by the Archimedean property ([[thm-of-archimedean]]) applied to $1/\eta$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

[L4] Absolute value: $|u| < c$ if and only if $-c < u < c$, for $c > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L5] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: adding a constant preserves $<$ and $\le$; $u \le v$ and $v < w$ give $u < w$; trichotomy, so exactly one of $z < 0$, $z = 0$, $z > 0$ holds and the negation of $z < 0$ is $z \ge 0$; $u \le v$ if and only if $v - u \ge 0$; and $u < u$ is impossible ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L6] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total, so any two indices admit a common upper bound ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

[L7] For $c \in \mathbb{R}$ the constant sequence $(c)$ converges to $c$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L8] A sequence of reals has at most one limit ([[lem-limit-unique]]), which is what licenses writing $\lim_k x_k$ and $\lim_k y_k$ for the limits named in the statement; without it those symbols would not denote.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 By [L2] the sequence $(z_k)$ converges to $z = y - x$, and by hypothesis $z_k = y_k - x_k \ge 0$ for every $k \ge K_0$. [given, L2, L5]

1.2 Suppose, for contradiction, that $z < 0$. [assume-contra]

2.1 Then $-z > 0$, so by [L3] we may choose a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < -z$. [step 1.2, L3, L5, choose]

3.1 Applying convergence of $(z_k)$ to this $\varepsilon$ gives $K_1 \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|z_k - z| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K_1$, hence $z_k - z < \varepsilon$ and so $z_k < z + \varepsilon$ for all such $k$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L1, L4, L5]

4.1 Fix an index $k$ with $k \ge K_0$ and $k \ge K_1$. Then $0 \le z_k < z + \varepsilon < z + (-z) = 0$, so $0 < 0$, which is impossible. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 3.1, L5, L6]

5.1 The assumption $z < 0$ is therefore untenable; by trichotomy $z \ge 0$, that is $y - x \ge 0$, that is $x \le y$; since $x$ and $y$ are the unique limits of $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ by [L8], that is exactly $\lim_k x_k \le \lim_k y_k$. Since $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ were an arbitrary pair satisfying the hypotheses, the conclusion applies to every such pair, and the two stated special cases are instances of it. Let $(w_k)$ be convergent. If $w_k \ge 0$ from some index on, apply the conclusion to the pair consisting of the constant sequence $0$, which converges to $0$ by [L7], and of $(w_k)$: it gives $0 \le \lim_k w_k$. If $a \le w_k \le b$ from some index on, apply it first to the constant sequence $a$ and $(w_k)$, then to $(w_k)$ and the constant sequence $b$: it gives $a \le \lim_k w_k$ and $\lim_k w_k \le b$. [step 4.1, L5, L7, L8, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- The two special cases are instances of the main claim, discharged in step 5.1 by taking one of the two sequences constant; that a constant sequence converges to its value ([[def-sequence]]) is the only extra ingredient they need.

- **The inequality does not become strict.** From $x_k < y_k$ for every $k$ one may conclude only $\lim x_k \le \lim y_k$; the witness $x_k = 0 < 1/(k+1) = y_k$ has equal limits ([[fs-limit-preserves-strict-inequality]]). Intuitively, the order relation $<$ is not preserved by passage to a limit because a strict gap may shrink to nothing, while $\le$ is preserved because it is closed under that shrinking.

- The proof routes through the single sequence $(z_k) = (y_k - x_k)$ and the difference rule of [[thm-algebra-of-limits]]. That is not an economy of writing only: it isolates the one thing being proved, namely that a sequence eventually $\ge 0$ cannot have a negative limit.

## Statement

Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals. If the series $\sum a_k$ converges
([[def-series]]) then the sequence $(a_k)$ converges ([[def-real-limit]]), with

$$\lim_{k} a_k \;=\; 0 .$$

Equivalently, in the contrapositive form in which the lemma is almost always
used: **if $(a_k)$ does not converge to $0$ then $\sum a_k$ diverges.**

The same statement holds for a series $\sum_{k \ge m} a_k$ with a general
starting index, with the conclusion that $(a_{j+m})_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges
to $0$: that series is by definition the series of the sequence
$b_j = a_{j+m}$ ([[def-series]]), so it is the statement above applied to $(b_j)$.

The converse is false; it is refuted by [[fs-nth-term-test-converse]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(a_k)$ of reals whose series converges, with partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[A1] $(s_n)$ converges to some real $S$ ([[def-series]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L1] The recursion clause of the finite sum: $s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[def-series]]).

[L2] Convergence depends only on the tail: if $(x_n)$ converges to $x$ then so does its $1$-st tail $(x_{n+1})_{n}$ ([[lem-limit-of-tail]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L3] Algebra of limits: if $x_n \to x$ and $y_n \to y$ then $x_n - y_n \to x - y$ ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The sequence $(s_{n+1})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is the $1$-st tail of $(s_n)$, and it converges to $S$. [A1, L2]

1.2 From the recursion clause, $a_n = s_{n+1} - s_n$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. [L1, algebra]

2.1 Hence $(a_n)$ is the difference of two sequences converging to $S$, so it converges to $S - S = 0$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, A1, L3]

3.1 That is the claim, and its contrapositive is the assertion that a series whose terms do not tend to $0$ diverges. [step 2.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **This is a necessary condition and never a sufficient one.** It rules a series out; it never rules one in. The harmonic series has terms tending to $0$ and diverges, which is exactly the content of [[fs-nth-term-test-converse]].

- **What the proof actually uses.** Only that the partial sums converge and that consecutive partial sums differ by a term. No sign hypothesis is placed on $(a_k)$, and none is available at this point on the page.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b \in F$.

1. If $a > 0$ then $a^{-1} > 0$.
2. If $0 < a < b$ then $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b \in F$.

[L1] $x > 0 \iff x \in P$; $x < 0 \iff -x \in P$; and for $x \neq 0$ exactly one of $x \in P$, $-x \in P$ holds ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Sign rules: a product of a positive and a negative is negative, a product of two positives is positive, and for $c > 0$ one has $a < b \iff ac < bc$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

[L3] $0 < 1$; in particular $1 \neq 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L4] $P$ is closed under addition, so $<$ is transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a > 0$, so $a \neq 0$ and its inverse $a^{-1}$ exists with $a \cdot a^{-1} = 1$; moreover $a^{-1} \neq 0$, since $a^{-1}$ has $a$ as its inverse while $0$ is non-invertible ($1 \neq 0$ by L3). [assume-hyp, L1, L3]

2.1 By trichotomy $a^{-1} \in P$ or $-a^{-1} \in P$; if $-a^{-1} \in P$, then $a > 0$ and $a^{-1} < 0$ give $a \cdot a^{-1} < 0$ by the sign rules, i.e. $1 < 0$, contradicting $0 < 1$; hence $a^{-1} \in P$, i.e. $a^{-1} > 0$, proving claim 1. [step 1.1, L2, L3, L1]

3.1 Assume $0 < a < b$; then $0 < b$ by transitivity, so by claim 1 both $a^{-1} > 0$ and $b^{-1} > 0$, and the sign rules give $a^{-1} b^{-1} > 0$. [assume-hyp, step 2.1, L4, L2, L1]

4.1 Multiplying $a < b$ by the positive $a^{-1} b^{-1}$ via the sign rules gives $a (a^{-1} b^{-1}) < b (a^{-1} b^{-1})$; since $a a^{-1} = 1$ and $b b^{-1} = 1$, this simplifies to $b^{-1} < a^{-1}$. [step 3.1, L2, algebra]

5.1 Together with $b^{-1} > 0$ from step 3.1, we conclude $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$, proving claim 2. [step 3.1, step 4.1] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field, with field structure as in [[def-field]], and for
$n \ge 1$ let $n \cdot 1_F$ denote the canonical natural number
$\underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$, defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$
and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$. Then for every $n \ge 1$:

- $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$;
- the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$;
- $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ and $(mn) \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F)$ for all $m, n \ge 1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ whose canonical naturals are defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, with $0 \cdot 1_F = 0$.

[L1] $0 < 1_F$ in every ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] The order is compatible with addition and positives are closed under addition: $a < b$ implies $a + c < b + c$, and $a > 0$, $b > 0$ imply $a + b > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 1$: by definition $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, and $1_F > 0$. [L1, base]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: assume $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for some fixed $n \ge 1$. [ih]

1.3 By the recursion, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F - n \cdot 1_F = 1_F > 0$, so $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$. [given, L1]

1.4 Additive identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ by the recursion, and if $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ then $(m+n+1) \cdot 1_F = (m+n) \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + (n+1) \cdot 1_F$. [given, algebra]

2.1 Inductive step: $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ is a sum of two positives, by the hypothesis and $1_F > 0$, hence $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Iterating 1.3, for $m < n$ one has $m \cdot 1_F < n \cdot 1_F$, so $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing and therefore injective on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$. [step 1.3, L2]

2.3 Multiplicative identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m \cdot 1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(1 \cdot 1_F)$, and the step $(m(n+1)) \cdot 1_F = (mn + m) \cdot 1_F = (mn) \cdot 1_F + m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F) + (m \cdot 1_F)(1_F) = (m \cdot 1_F)((n+1) \cdot 1_F)$ uses 1.4 and distributivity. [step 1.4, algebra]

## Statement

Let $a, b$ be elements of a field ([[def-field]]) and let integer powers be as in
[[def-integer-power]].

1. For all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$: $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$.
2. If $a \ne 0$ then $a^n \ne 0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and $a^{-m} = (a^m)^{-1}$ for every $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ ([[def-int-operations]]).
3. If $a \ne 0$ and $b \ne 0$ then all three identities of claim 1 hold for all $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Elements $a, b$ of a field $F$, naturals $m, n, p, q, k$ and integers ranged over by $m, n$ in claims 2 and 3.

[L1] Definition of powers ([[def-integer-power]]): $a^0 = 1$ and $a^{n+1} = a^n a$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$; and $a^{-n} := (a^n)^{-1}$ for $a \ne 0$ and $n \ge 1$, the two clauses agreeing at $n = 0$.

[L2] Induction principle ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L3] Field arithmetic: multiplication is associative and commutative with identity $1$, and every nonzero element has an inverse ([[def-field]]); inverses are unique ([[lem-of-inverse-unique]], which states uniqueness and nothing further), and HENCE, for $x, y \ne 0$, $(xy)^{-1} = x^{-1} y^{-1}$ and $(x^{-1})^{-1} = x$, since $(xy)(x^{-1}y^{-1}) = 1$ and $x^{-1}x = 1$ exhibit inverses that uniqueness then identifies.

[L4] A field has no zero divisors: $xy = 0$ implies $x = 0$ or $y = 0$ ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]).

[L5] $\mathbb{Z}$ is a commutative ring in which every element is $\iota(k)$ or $-\iota(k)$ for a unique natural $k$ ([[thm-int-comm-ring]], [[lem-nat-embeds-int]], [[def-int-operations]]); we write $k$ for $\iota(k)$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base cases at $n = 0$ for the addition law, the product law and nonvanishing: $a^{m+0} = a^m = a^m \cdot 1 = a^m a^0$ for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$; $(ab)^0 = 1 = 1 \cdot 1 = a^0 b^0$; and if $a \ne 0$ then $a^0 = 1 \ne 0$. [base, L1, L3]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$ for all $m \in \mathbb{N}$, $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$, and $a^n \ne 0$ whenever $a \ne 0$. The iterated-power law $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ is deliberately NOT carried in this hypothesis: its successor step needs the addition law at the exponent pair $(mn, m)$, whose second entry is not the current stage, so that law must be finished first and the iterated law proved afterwards. [ih]

1.3 For $a \ne 0$ and every integer $j$, $a^{-j} = (a^j)^{-1}$: for $j \ge 0$ this is the definition together with the agreement of the two clauses at $j = 0$, and for $j = -k$ with $k \ge 1$ it reads $a^{k} = (a^{-k})^{-1}$, which holds because $a^{-k} = (a^k)^{-1}$ and $(x^{-1})^{-1} = x$ at $x = a^{k}$. That last substitution needs $a^{k} \ne 0$, which is NOT free here and must not be read off the definition, since the definition of the negative clause is what is being justified; it is instead a self-contained induction on $k$, from $a^{0} = 1 \ne 0$ and the fact that $a^{k+1} = a^{k}a$ is a product of two nonzero elements of a field, hence nonzero. [L1, L2, L3, L4, L5]

2.1 Successor step for the addition law, the product law and nonvanishing: $a^{m+(n+1)} = a^{(m+n)+1} = a^{m+n} a = (a^m a^n) a = a^m (a^n a) = a^m a^{n+1}$ for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$; $(ab)^{n+1} = (ab)^n (ab) = (a^n b^n)(ab) = (a^n a)(b^n b) = a^{n+1} b^{n+1}$; and if $a \ne 0$ then $a^{n+1} = a^n a$ is a product of two nonzero elements, hence nonzero. [step 1.2, L1, L3, L4]

3.1 By the induction principle, for all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$: $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$, and $a^n \ne 0$ whenever $a \ne 0$. The addition law is thereby available at EVERY pair of natural exponents, which is exactly what the iterated-power law needs. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L2]

4.1 The iterated-power law for natural exponents, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$, by a second induction on $n$ with $m \in \mathbb{N}$ fixed: at $n = 0$ both sides are $1$, since $(a^m)^0 = 1 = a^0 = a^{m \cdot 0}$; and if $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ then $(a^m)^{n+1} = (a^m)^n a^m = a^{mn} a^m = a^{mn+m} = a^{m(n+1)}$, where the third equality is the addition law of step 3.1 at the pair $(mn, m)$, legitimate precisely because that law is by now proved for all pairs of naturals. This completes claim 1. [step 3.1, L1, L2, L3]

4.2 For $a \ne 0$ and every integer $j$, $a^{j+1} = a^j a$: for $j \ge 0$ this is the recursion clause, and for $j = -k$ with $k \ge 1$ we compute $a^{-k} a = (a^k)^{-1} a = (a^{k-1} a)^{-1} a = (a^{k-1})^{-1} a^{-1} a = (a^{k-1})^{-1} = a^{-(k-1)} = a^{-k+1}$. [step 3.1, step 1.3, L1, L3]

4.3 For $a, b \ne 0$ the product law holds for all integers $n$: for $n \ge 0$ it is step 3.1, and for $n = -k$ with $k \ge 1$ we get $(ab)^{-k} = ((ab)^k)^{-1} = (a^k b^k)^{-1} = (a^k)^{-1}(b^k)^{-1} = a^{-k} b^{-k}$. [step 3.1, step 1.3, L3, L5]

5.1 For $a \ne 0$, every integer $j$ and every natural $k$, $a^{j+k} = a^j a^k$, by induction on $k$: the case $k = 0$ is $a^j = a^j \cdot 1$, and if $a^{j+k} = a^j a^k$ then $a^{j+k+1} = a^{j+k} a = a^j a^k a = a^j a^{k+1}$ by step 4.2 applied to the integer $j+k$ and by the recursion clause. [step 4.2, L1, L2, L3]

6.1 For $a \ne 0$ the addition law holds for all integers $m, n$: writing $n = k$ or $n = -k$ with $k \in \mathbb{N}$, the case $n = k$ is step 5.1, while for $n = -k$ step 5.1 applied to the integer $m - k$ gives $a^m = a^{(m-k)+k} = a^{m-k} a^k$, hence $a^{m-k} = a^m (a^k)^{-1} = a^m a^{-k}$. [step 5.1, step 1.3, L3, L5]

7.1 For $a \ne 0$ the iterated-power law holds for all integers $m, n$: for $n \ge 0$ induction on $n$ gives $(a^m)^{n+1} = (a^m)^n a^m = a^{mn} a^m = a^{mn+m} = a^{m(n+1)}$, the third equality by the integer addition law of step 6.1 at the pair $(mn, m)$, with base $(a^m)^0 = 1 = a^0$; and for $n = -q$ with $q \ge 1$, $(a^m)^{-q} = ((a^m)^q)^{-1} = (a^{mq})^{-1} = a^{-mq} = a^{m(-q)}$, using that $a^m \ne 0$ by step 3.1 and step 1.3. [step 6.1, step 3.1, step 1.3, L2, L3, L5]

8.1 Claims 1, 2 and 3 are therefore established: the addition, product and iterated-power laws for natural exponents together with nonvanishing by steps 3.1 and 4.1, the identity $a^{-m} = (a^m)^{-1}$ by step 1.3, and the three integer-exponent laws by steps 6.1, 4.3 and 7.1. [step 3.1, step 4.1, step 1.3, step 6.1, step 4.3, step 7.1, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ be sequences of reals whose series converge
([[def-series]]), and let $c \in \mathbb{R}$. Then:

1. $\sum (a_k + b_k)$ converges, with
   $\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k + \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} b_k$;
2. $\sum c\,a_k$ converges, with
   $\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c\,a_k = c \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k$.

Moreover, for $c \ne 0$ and an arbitrary sequence $(a_k)$, whose series is not
assumed to converge:

3. $\sum c\,a_k$ converges **if and only if** $\sum a_k$ converges. Equivalently,
   $\sum a_k$ diverges if and only if $\sum c\,a_k$ diverges.

Claim 3 is the form used whenever a comparison is made against a constant
multiple of a known series.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $(a_k)$, $(b_k)$ of reals and $c \in \mathbb{R}$, with partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $t_n = \sum_{k<n} b_k$ ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[L1] Additivity and scaling of finite sums: $\sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k$ and $\sum_{k<n} c\,a_k = c \sum_{k<n} a_k$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L2] Algebra of limits: if $x_n \to x$ and $y_n \to y$ then $x_n + y_n \to x + y$ and $c\,x_n \to c\,x$ ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The partial sums of $\sum (a_k + b_k)$ are $\sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) = s_n + t_n$, and those of $\sum c\,a_k$ are $\sum_{k<n} c\,a_k = c\,s_n$. [given, L1]

1.2 Assume $\sum a_k$ and $\sum b_k$ converge, say $s_n \to S$ and $t_n \to T$. [given]

2.1 Then $s_n + t_n \to S + T$, so $\sum(a_k + b_k)$ converges with sum $S + T$, which is claim 1. [step 1.2, step 1.1, L2]

2.2 Likewise $c\,s_n \to c\,S$, so $\sum c\,a_k$ converges with sum $c\,S$, which is claim 2. [step 1.2, step 1.1, L2]

3.1 For claim 3, let $c \ne 0$ and let $(a_k)$ be arbitrary. If $\sum a_k$ converges then $\sum c\,a_k$ converges by claim 2. [step 2.2]

3.2 Conversely, if $\sum c\,a_k$ converges then applying claim 2 to the sequence $(c\,a_k)$ and the scalar $1/c$, which exists since $c \ne 0$, shows that $\sum (1/c)(c\,a_k) = \sum a_k$ converges. [step 2.2, algebra]

4.1 The two implications are claim 3, and its contrapositive form is the statement about divergence. [step 3.1, step 3.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **There is no product rule here, and there is no rule for $\sum a_k b_k$.** The proof works because a finite sum is additive and homogeneous, and neither property has an analogue for products. Multiplying series is a genuinely harder question, requiring absolute convergence, and it is not treated on this page.

- **Claim 3 needs $c \ne 0$ and nothing else.** In particular it does not need either series to converge, which is what makes it usable in the divergence direction: scaling a divergent series by a nonzero constant leaves it divergent.

## Statement

Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals with partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$, let
$N \in \mathbb{N}$, and let $t_j := \sum_{i<j} a_{N+i}$ be the partial sums of the
$N$-th tail series $\sum_{k \ge N} a_k$ ([[def-series]]). Then:

1. $t_j = s_{j+N} - s_N$ for every $j \in \mathbb{N}$;
2. $\sum a_k$ converges **if and only if** its $N$-th tail series converges, and
   in that case
   $$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k \;=\; s_N \;+\; \sum_{k=N}^{\infty} a_k ;$$
3. hence the following are equivalent: $\sum a_k$ converges; every tail series of
   $\sum a_k$ converges; some tail series of $\sum a_k$ converges.

In words: convergence of a series is a property of its terms from any index on,
and changing finitely many terms changes the sum but not the fact of convergence.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(a_k)$ of reals, a natural number $N$, the partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ and the partial sums $t_j = \sum_{i<j} a_{N+i}$ of the $N$-th tail series ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[L1] Splitting of finite sums: if $m \le n$ then $\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]), and $\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k$ is by definition $\sum_{i<n-m} a_{m+i}$ ([[def-finite-sum]]).

[L2] Convergence depends only on the tail: a sequence $(x_n)$ converges to $x$ if and only if its $N$-th tail $(x_{j+N})_{j}$ converges to $x$ ([[lem-limit-of-tail]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L3] Algebra of limits: if $x_j \to x$ and $y_j \to y$ then $x_j + y_j \to x + y$ and $x_j - y_j \to x - y$ ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]]).

[L4] A constant sequence $y_j = c$ converges to $c$, immediately from the definition of a limit ([[def-real-limit]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Fix $j \in \mathbb{N}$ and put $n := j + N$, so that $N \le n$ and $n - N = j$. [given]

1.2 The family $(s_{j+N})_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ is the $N$-th tail of the sequence $(s_n)$ of partial sums. [given, L2]

2.1 Splitting the partial sum $s_n$ at $N$ gives $s_n = \sum_{k<N} a_k + \sum_{k=N}^{n-1} a_k = s_N + \sum_{i<j} a_{N+i} = s_N + t_j$. [step 1.1, L1]

2.2 Suppose $\sum a_k$ converges, say $s_n \to S$; then the $N$-th tail $(s_{j+N})_j$ converges to $S$. [given, step 1.2, L2]

3.1 Claim 1 follows: $t_j = s_{j+N} - s_N$ for every $j \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.1, algebra]

4.1 The constant sequence with value $s_N$ converges to $s_N$, so $t_j = s_{j+N} - s_N \to S - s_N$, and the $N$-th tail series converges with sum $S - s_N$. [step 2.2, step 3.1, L3, L4]

4.2 Conversely, suppose the $N$-th tail series converges, say $t_j \to T$; then $s_{j+N} = s_N + t_j \to s_N + T$ by the same two rules. [step 3.1, L3, L4]

5.1 So the $N$-th tail of $(s_n)$ converges to $s_N + T$, hence $(s_n)$ itself converges to $s_N + T$ and $\sum a_k$ converges. [step 4.2, step 1.2, L2]

6.1 Claim 2 follows: the two convergences are equivalent, and when they hold the sums are related by $S = s_N + T$, which is the displayed identity. [step 4.1, step 5.1, algebra]

7.1 Claim 3 follows as well: if $\sum a_k$ converges then by claim 2 every tail series converges; every tail series converging trivially gives some tail series converging, the family of tails being indexed by all of $\mathbb{N}$; and if some tail series, say the $N$-th, converges then by claim 2 again $\sum a_k$ converges. [step 6.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the hypothesis-free character comes from.** Nothing here assumes the terms have a sign or that any series converges: claim 1 is an identity between finite sums, valid always, and claims 2 and 3 are read off from it by two standard limit rules. That is why the lemma may be used to move between a series and its tails inside proofs that have not yet decided the convergence question.

- **The sum does change.** Only the fact of convergence is tail invariant. The identity in claim 2 is the exact bookkeeping: discarding the first $N$ terms lowers the sum by $s_N$, and no more.

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ be sequences of reals ([[def-sequence]]) converging to
$x$ and $y$ respectively ([[def-real-limit]]), and let $c \in \mathbb{R}$. Then

$$x_k + y_k \to x + y, \qquad c\,x_k \to c\,x, \qquad x_k - y_k \to x - y, \qquad x_k y_k \to x y,$$

and if in addition $y \ne 0$ and $y_k \ne 0$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, then

$$\frac{1}{y_k} \to \frac{1}{y} \qquad \text{and} \qquad \frac{x_k}{y_k} \to \frac{x}{y}.$$

The quotient case rests on an eventual lower bound for $|y_k|$, proved below
rather than assumed: $|y_k| > |y|/2$ for all sufficiently large $k$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $(x_k)$, $(y_k)$ of reals with $(x_k)$ converging to $x$ and $(y_k)$ converging to $y$, and a real $c$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]). For the last two claims we assume in addition $y \ne 0$ and $y_k \ne 0$ for every $k$.

[L1] Convergence, quantified over rational $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-real-limit]]).

[L2] Absolute value and the triangle inequality: $|uv| = |u|\,|v|$, $|u| \ge 0$, $|u| = 0$ if and only if $u = 0$, $|-u| = |u|$, and $|a + b| \le |a| + |b|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L3] Real versus rational $\varepsilon$: for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, by density ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) or by the Archimedean property ([[thm-of-archimedean]]) applied to $1/\eta$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]); consequently the convergence test of [[def-real-limit]] may equivalently be run with real $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-sequence]]).

[L4] Convergent sequences are bounded ([[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]]), and a constant sequence $(c)$ is bounded by $|c|$ ([[def-sequence]]).

[L5] A null sequence times a bounded sequence is null ([[lem-null-times-bounded]]).

[L6] Reverse triangle inequality: $\bigl||u| - |v|\bigr| \le |u - v|$, hence $|u| \ge |v| - |v - u|$ ([[cor-of-reverse-triangle]]).

[L7] Inverses and order: $a > 0$ implies $a^{-1} > 0$; $0 < a < b$ implies $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$; $(u^{-1})^{-1} = u$ for $u \ne 0$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-field]]).

[L8] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: adding a constant and adding inequalities preserve the order, multiplying a strict inequality by a positive factor preserves it, and $\le$ and $<$ compose transitively; trichotomy holds, and since $u \ge 0$ means $u > 0$ or $u = 0$, an element with $u \ge 0$ and $u \ne 0$ satisfies $u > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]). Moreover $2 = 1 + 1 > 0$ and $2$ is invertible: $0 < 1$ in any ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]) and the positives are closed under addition, so $2 > 0$ and in particular $2 \ne 0$ ([[def-ordered-field]]), whence $2^{-1}$ exists ([[def-field]]).

[L9] Rational arithmetic: $\varepsilon/2$ is a rational $> 0$ whenever $\varepsilon$ is, and $\varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$ ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]); the order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total, so finitely many thresholds admit a common index ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Reduction to null sequences: for any sequence $(z_k)$ of reals and any real $z$, the statements "$(z_k)$ converges to $z$" and "$(z_k - z)$ converges to $0$" are literally the same condition, because $|(z_k - z) - 0| = |z_k - z|$ for every $k$. [L1, L2]

1.2 Sum rule, in general form. Let $(u_k) \to u$ and $(v_k) \to v$ be any convergent sequences of reals and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be rational; take $K_1$ with $|u_k - u| < \varepsilon/2$ for $k \ge K_1$ and $K_2$ with $|v_k - v| < \varepsilon/2$ for $k \ge K_2$, and let $K$ be an index at least as large as both. For $k \ge K$, $|(u_k + v_k) - (u + v)| = |(u_k - u) + (v_k - v)| \le |u_k - u| + |v_k - v| < \varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$; hence $u_k + v_k \to u + v$, and in particular $x_k + y_k \to x + y$. [L1, L2, L8, L9, algebra]

1.3 Boundedness: every convergent sequence of reals is bounded, and every constant sequence $(d)$ is bounded by $|d|$. [L4]

1.4 Quotient preparation. Assume $y \ne 0$ and $y_k \ne 0$ for every $k$. Then $|y| > 0$ by [L2], so $|y|/2 > 0$; running the convergence test of $(y_k)$ with the real number $|y|/2$ as tolerance, which [L3] licenses, produces $K_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|y_k - y| < |y|/2$ for all $k \ge K_0$. [L1, L2, L3, L7, L8, choose]

2.1 Scalar rule, in general form. Let $(u_k) \to u$ and let $d \in \mathbb{R}$. By step 1.1 the sequence $(u_k - u)$ is null and by step 1.3 the constant sequence $(d)$ is bounded, so $(d(u_k - u)) = (d u_k - d u)$ is null by [L5]; by step 1.1 again, $d u_k \to d u$, and in particular $c x_k \to c x$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, L5, algebra]

2.2 Product rule, in general form. Let $(u_k) \to u$ and $(v_k) \to v$, and write $u_k v_k - u v = u_k(v_k - v) + v(u_k - u)$. By step 1.1 both $(v_k - v)$ and $(u_k - u)$ are null; by step 1.3 both $(u_k)$ and the constant sequence $(v)$ are bounded; so both $(u_k(v_k - v))$ and $(v(u_k - u))$ are null by [L5], and their sum is null by step 1.2 applied with both limits equal to $0$. By step 1.1, $u_k v_k \to u v$, and in particular $x_k y_k \to x y$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, L5, algebra]

2.3 Eventual lower bound. For every $k \ge K_0$, the reverse triangle inequality gives $|y_k| \ge |y| - |y - y_k| = |y| - |y_k - y| > |y| - |y|/2 = |y|/2 > 0$; so $|y_k| > |y|/2$ for all $k \ge K_0$, and in particular $|y_k| \ne 0$ there. [step 1.4, L2, L6, L8]

3.1 Difference rule. Applying step 2.1 to the sequence $(y_k)$ with $d = -1$ gives $-y_k \to -y$; the sum rule of step 1.2 applied to $(x_k)$ and $(-y_k)$ then gives $x_k - y_k = x_k + (-y_k) \to x + (-y) = x - y$. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L8, algebra]

3.2 Reciprocal estimate. For $k \ge K_0$ we have $y_k \ne 0$ and $|y_k| > |y|/2 > 0$, so [L7] applied to $0 < |y|/2 < |y_k|$ gives $0 < |y_k|^{-1} < 2/|y|$, and therefore $\left|\dfrac{1}{y_k} - \dfrac{1}{y}\right| = \dfrac{|y - y_k|}{|y_k|\,|y|} \le \dfrac{2}{|y|^2}\,|y_k - y|$. [step 2.3, L2, L7, L8, algebra]

4.1 Reciprocal rule. Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real and put $\eta := \varepsilon |y|^2/2$, a real $> 0$; by [L3] there is $K_1$ with $|y_k - y| < \eta$ for all $k \ge K_1$. For every $k$ at least as large as both $K_0$ and $K_1$, step 3.2 gives $\left|\dfrac{1}{y_k} - \dfrac{1}{y}\right| \le \dfrac{2}{|y|^2}|y_k - y| < \dfrac{2}{|y|^2}\,\eta = \varepsilon$; hence $1/y_k \to 1/y$. [step 3.2, L1, L3, L7, L8, L9, algebra]

5.1 Quotient rule. By step 4.1 the sequence $(1/y_k)$ converges to $1/y$, so the product rule of step 2.2 applied to $(x_k)$ and $(1/y_k)$ gives $x_k/y_k = x_k \cdot (1/y_k) \to x \cdot (1/y) = x/y$. [step 2.2, step 4.1, algebra]

6.1 All the claims are established: the sum rule in step 1.2, the scalar rule in step 2.1, the difference rule in step 3.1, the product rule in step 2.2, and the reciprocal and quotient rules in steps 4.1 and 5.1. [step 1.2, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, step 4.1, step 5.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The quotient case is where proofs usually cheat.** The estimate $|1/y_k - 1/y| = |y - y_k| / (|y_k||y|)$ is worthless until $|y_k|$ is known to stay away from $0$: without a lower bound the denominator can be arbitrarily small and the fraction arbitrarily large, even while $|y - y_k|$ shrinks. Step 2.3 supplies that bound, $|y_k| > |y|/2$ for $k \ge K_0$, and it is proved from the reverse triangle inequality, not assumed.

- The hypothesis $y_k \ne 0$ for every $k$ is only there so that $1/y_k$ is defined for every index. It is not needed for the limit: step 2.3 shows $|y_k| > |y|/2 > 0$ from $K_0$ on, so a sequence with $y \ne 0$ has at most finitely many zero terms, and by [[lem-limit-of-tail]] one may pass to the $K_0$-th tail and read the conclusion there.

- The hypothesis $y \ne 0$ cannot be dropped. With $x_k = 1$ and $y_k = 1/(k+1)$, both sequences converge: the first is constant ([[def-sequence]]) and the second is null ([[fs-limit-preserves-strict-inequality]]), so $y = 0$. Yet $x_k/y_k = k+1$, and no real $M$ bounds every $k+1$, by the Archimedean property ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); so the quotient sequence is unbounded, hence not convergent by [[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]].

- Nothing in the proof uses completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ beyond the Archimedean property invoked in [L3], so the same rules hold verbatim for sequences of rationals.

## Statement

Let $r \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $r^k$ be the integer power ([[def-integer-power]]),
so that $r^0 = 1$ for every $r$, including $r = 0$.

1. If $|r| < 1$ then the series $\sum r^k$ converges ([[def-series]]) and
   $$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} r^{k} \;=\; \frac{1}{1-r} .$$
2. If $|r| \ge 1$ then $\sum r^k$ diverges.

The series starts at $k = 0$ and its first term is $r^0 = 1$; in particular
$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} 2^{-k} = 2$, while the series starting at $k = 1$ sums to
$1$. Which starting index is meant has to be said, and it is said here.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real number $r$, the integer powers $r^k$ ([[def-integer-power]]), and the partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} r^k$ of $\sum r^k$ ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[L1] Factorisation of a difference of powers: for $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and natural $n \ge 1$, $b^n - a^n = (b-a)\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a^k b^{\,n-1-k}$ ([[lem-power-difference-factorisation]]).

[L2] For $|r| < 1$ the sequence $(r^k)$ is null, that is $r^k \to 0$ ([[lem-geometric-sequence-null]]).

[L3] Algebra of limits: sums, differences and quotients of convergent sequences converge to the corresponding combination, the quotient rule requiring a nonzero limit and nonzero denominators ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L4] Absolute value: $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$, $|x| \ge 0$, and $|x| = 0$ exactly when $x = 0$; also $|1| = 1$, since $1 > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L5] Powers and order: $a^0 = 1$ for every $a$; if $a \ge 1$ and $n \ge 1$ then $a^n \ge a \ge 1$; and $1^n = 1$ for every $n$ ([[lem-power-monotone]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L6] The principle of induction ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L7] If a series converges then its terms tend to $0$ ([[lem-nth-term-test]]).

[L8] Notation of [[def-finite-sum]]: $\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x_k$ is $\sum_{k<n} x_k$, and the empty sum $\sum_{k<0} x_k$ is $0$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Assume $|r| < 1$. [assume-case lt]

1.2 Assume instead $|r| \ge 1$. [assume-case ge]

1.3 For every natural $n \ge 1$, applying [L1] with $b = 1$ and $a = r$ gives $1 - r^n = (1-r)\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} r^k \cdot 1^{\,n-1-k} = (1-r)\,s_n$, using $1^m = 1$ and the notation of [L8]. [L1, L5, L8]

1.4 At $n = 0$ the identity $1 - r^n = (1-r)s_n$ also holds, both sides being $0$ because $r^0 = 1$ and $s_0$ is the empty sum. [L5, L8]

2.1 In the case $|r| < 1$ we have $r \ne 1$, since $|1| = 1$ and $|r| < 1$; hence $1 - r \ne 0$. [step 1.1, L4, algebra]

2.2 In the case $|r| \ge 1$, an induction gives $|r^k| = |r|^k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$: at $k = 0$ both sides are $1$, and if $|r^k| = |r|^k$ then $|r^{k+1}| = |r^k \cdot r| = |r^k|\,|r| = |r|^k |r| = |r|^{k+1}$. [step 1.2, L4, L5, L6]

2.3 In the case $|r| \ge 1$ we get $|r|^k \ge 1$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$: at $k = 0$ this reads $1 \ge 1$, and for $k \ge 1$ it is the comparison $|r|^k \ge |r| \ge 1$. [step 1.2, L5]

3.1 In the case $|r| < 1$, dividing by $1 - r \ne 0$ gives $s_n = (1 - r^n)/(1-r)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.1, step 1.3, step 1.4, algebra]

3.2 In the case $|r| \ge 1$, combining the two previous steps gives $|r^k - 0| = |r^k| = |r|^k \ge 1$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.2, step 2.3]

4.1 In the case $|r| < 1$ the sequence $(r^n)$ is null, so $1 - r^n \to 1$ and therefore $s_n \to 1/(1-r)$, the denominator being the nonzero constant $1-r$; hence $\sum r^k$ converges with sum $1/(1-r)$, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 3.1, step 2.1, L2, L3]

4.2 In the case $|r| \ge 1$ the sequence $(r^k)$ does not converge to $0$, since the rational tolerance $\varepsilon = 1$ admits no index $K$ with $|r^k - 0| < 1$ for all $k \ge K$; so by the term test $\sum r^k$ diverges, which is claim 2. [step 3.2, L7]

5.1 The two cases $|r| < 1$ and $|r| \ge 1$ exhaust the possibilities, since the order on $\mathbb{R}$ is total, so claims 1 and 2 together cover every real $r$. [step 4.1, step 4.2, cases-exhaustive] ∎

## Remarks

- **The divergence half needs no separate treatment of $r = 1$ and $r = -1$.** Both are covered by $|r| \ge 1$, and the single reason is the same in every case: the terms have absolute value at least $1$, so they cannot tend to $0$. For $r = 1$ the partial sums are $s_n = n$ and run to $+\infty$; for $r = -1$ they oscillate between $0$ and $1$. The theorem says only that neither converges, which is all that "diverges" means here ([[def-series]]).

- **Why the identity is proved at $n = 0$ separately.** [[lem-power-difference-factorisation]] requires $n \ge 1$, since its right-hand side is a sum over $k < n$ of a term involving $b^{\,n-1-k}$, and $n-1$ is not a natural number at $n = 0$. The identity is still true at $n = 0$, but by inspection of two empty objects rather than by that lemma, and step 1.4 says so rather than letting the reader assume the citation covers it.

## Statement

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. If $0 \in S$ and $\sigma(n) \in S$ whenever $n \in S$, then $S = \mathbb{N}$. Equivalently (property form): if a property $P$ satisfies $P(0)$ and ($P(n) \Rightarrow P(\sigma(n))$) for all $n$, then $P(n)$ holds for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. This is the induction principle, the basis of proof by induction.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $\mathbb{N} = \omega$ is the smallest inductive set ([[def-inductive-set]], [[def-natural-numbers]], [[lem-omega-smallest-inductive]]); $0 = \varnothing$, $\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$.

[L1] $\omega$ is contained in every inductive set ([[lem-omega-smallest-inductive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Suppose $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ with $0 = \varnothing \in S$ and ($x \in S \Rightarrow \sigma(x) = x \cup \{x\} \in S$). [given]

2.1 Then $S$ contains $\varnothing$ and is closed under $x \mapsto x \cup \{x\}$, so $S$ is an inductive set. [step 1.1]

3.1 $\mathbb{N} = \omega \subseteq S$ because $\omega$ is a subset of every inductive set. [L1, step 2.1]

4.1 With $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ by hypothesis, $S = \mathbb{N}$. [step 3.1, given]

5.1 The property form is the set case with $S = \{n \in \mathbb{N} : P(n)\}$: $P(0)$ and $P(n) \Rightarrow P(\sigma(n))$ give $0 \in S$ and $\sigma$-closure, so $S = \mathbb{N}$, i.e. $P$ holds for all $n$; conversely the set form is the property form applied to $P(n) :\equiv n \in S$, so the two are equivalent.

## Statement

Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals with $a_k \ge 0$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$,
let $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ be its partial sums and let
$S = \{\, s_n : n \in \mathbb{N} \,\}$ be the range of $(s_n)$ ([[def-series]]).
Then:

1. $(s_n)$ is nondecreasing ([[def-monotone-sequence]]) and $s_n \ge 0$ for every
   $n$;
2. $\sum a_k$ converges **if and only if** $S$ is bounded above
   ([[def-bounded-set]]), and in that case
   $$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k \;=\; \sup S ,$$
   so in particular $s_n \le \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k$ for every $n$;
3. if $S$ is not bounded above then $s_n \to +\infty$
   ([[def-divergence-to-infinity]]) and $\sum a_k$ diverges.

This is the theorem that makes the nonnegative theory work: for terms of one
sign, convergence is a boundedness question and no candidate limit is ever
needed. Every comparison test on this page is an application of it.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(a_k)$ of reals with $a_k \ge 0$ for every $k$, its partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$, and the range $S = \{s_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L1] The recursion clause of the finite sum: $s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ ([[def-finite-sum]]).

[L2] Consecutive comparisons suffice for monotonicity: $(x_k)$ is nondecreasing if and only if $x_k \le x_{k+1}$ for every $k$; and a nondecreasing sequence is bounded below by its first term ([[def-monotone-sequence]]).

[L3] Monotonicity of finite sums: if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L4] A monotone sequence converges if and only if it is bounded, that is if and only if there is $M$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for every $k$ ([[cor-monotone-converges-iff-bounded]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L5] A nondecreasing sequence bounded above converges to the supremum of its range, which exists by the least-upper-bound property ([[thm-monotone-convergence]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L6] A nondecreasing sequence whose range is not bounded above diverges to $+\infty$ ([[lem-monotone-unbounded-diverges]], [[def-divergence-to-infinity]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For every $n$, $s_{n+1} - s_n = a_n \ge 0$, so $s_n \le s_{n+1}$ and $(s_n)$ is nondecreasing. [given, L1, L2]

1.2 For every $n$, $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, all terms being nonnegative. [given, L3]

2.1 Claim 1 is steps 1.1 and 1.2 together. [step 1.1, step 1.2]

2.2 Since $s_n \ge 0$ we have $|s_n| = s_n$, so $(s_n)$ is bounded in the sense of [L4] if and only if $S$ is bounded above. [step 1.2, L4]

3.1 By [L4] applied to the monotone sequence $(s_n)$, the series converges if and only if $(s_n)$ is bounded, hence if and only if $S$ is bounded above. [step 1.1, step 2.2, L4]

4.1 If $S$ is bounded above then $(s_n)$ converges to $\sup S$, so $\sum a_k$ converges with sum $\sup S$; and since $\sup S$ is an upper bound of $S$, $s_n \le \sup S$ for every $n$. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L5]

4.2 If $S$ is not bounded above then $s_n \to +\infty$, and by step 3.1 the series diverges. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L6]

5.1 The equivalence and the identification of the sum as the supremum together make claim 2, and the divergence statement is claim 3. [step 3.1, step 4.1, step 4.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **"Bounded" and "bounded above" coincide here, and only here.** The equivalence used in step 2.2 rests on $s_n \ge 0$, which rests on every term being nonnegative. For a series with terms of both signs the partial sums can be bounded above and still fail to converge, so nothing in this theorem survives the loss of the sign hypothesis. That failure is exhibited by [[cex-comparison-needs-nonnegativity]] on the companion page.

- **Claim 3 is a strictly stronger statement than "diverges".** Divergence alone permits oscillation ([[def-series]]); for nonnegative terms it cannot occur, and the partial sums necessarily run to $+\infty$. This is what licenses the phrase "the series diverges to $+\infty$" for nonnegative terms, and it is what the Abel-Dini theorem later on this page uses.

- **This criterion is the monotone convergence property, worn differently.** The proof above is monotone convergence for $\mathbb{R}$ applied to the nondecreasing sequence of partial sums, and nothing is lost going back the other way. Given a nondecreasing sequence $(x_n)$ of reals, put $y_n := x_n - x_0 \ge 0$ and let $a_0 := 0$, $a_{k+1} := y_{k+1} - y_k \ge 0$; then $s_{n+1} = y_n$ ([[def-series]]), the partial sums are bounded exactly when $(x_n)$ is bounded above, and claim 1 returns the convergence of $(y_n)$ and so of $(x_n)$. Testing boundedness of partial sums is therefore not a device special to series. Read in the vocabulary of [[def-completeness-properties]] it is the property (MCT), which in an arbitrary ordered field already forces the Archimedean property on its own ([[lem-mct-implies-archimedean]]) and with it the least-upper-bound property ([[lem-mct-implies-lub]]). The translation just given is carried out in $\mathbb{R}$, since [[def-series]] is stated for sequences of reals and this library defines no series over a general ordered field.

## Statement

Let $(N,0,\sigma)$ be a Peano system ([[def-peano-system]]), in particular the natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]). For any set $A$, any element $a \in A$, and any function $f : A \to A$, there is a unique function $g : N \to A$ such that $g(0) = a$ and $g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n))$ for all $n \in N$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** a Peano system $(N,0,\sigma)$, a set $A$, an element $a \in A$, and a function $f : A \to A$. Call a set $R \subseteq N \times A$ **closed** when $(0,a) \in R$ and, for all $n \in N$ and $x \in A$, $(n,x) \in R$ implies $(\sigma(n),f(x)) \in R$.

[L1] Induction holds in $N$: any $S \subseteq N$ with $0 \in S$ that is closed under $\sigma$ equals $N$ (axiom P3, [[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L2] In a Peano system $\sigma(n) \ne 0$ (P1) and $\sigma$ is injective (P2) ([[def-peano-system]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The set $N \times A$ is closed, so the collection of closed subsets of $N \times A$ is nonempty; let $g := \bigcap \{ R : R \subseteq N \times A \text{ closed} \}$, which is itself closed, since if every closed $R$ contains $(0,a)$ then so does $g$, and if $(n,x) \in g$ then $(n,x) \in R$ for each closed $R$, whence $(\sigma(n),f(x)) \in R$ for each such $R$, so $(\sigma(n),f(x)) \in g$. [given, construct]

2.1 Let $D = \{ n \in N : \exists x \in A,\ (n,x) \in g \}$; then $0 \in D$ since $(0,a) \in g$, and if $n \in D$ with $(n,x) \in g$ then $(\sigma(n),f(x)) \in g$ by closure, so $\sigma(n) \in D$; by induction $D = N$, hence $g$ relates every $n$ to at least one $x$. [L1, step 1.1]

2.2 Suppose $(0,b) \in g$ with $b \ne a$; then $g \setminus \{(0,b)\}$ still contains $(0,a)$ and is closed, since any generated pair $(\sigma(m),f(z))$ has $\sigma(m) \ne 0$ by P1 and so is never equal to $(0,b)$; this contradicts the minimality of $g$, so $a$ is the unique second coordinate paired with $0$. [L2, step 1.1]

3.1 Let $U = \{ n \in N : \text{there is exactly one } x \text{ with } (n,x) \in g \}$; then $0 \in U$ by step 2.2. [step 2.2]

4.1 Assume $n \in U$ with unique value $x$, so $(n,x) \in g$ and $(\sigma(n),f(x)) \in g$ by closure; if $(\sigma(n),c) \in g$ with $c \ne f(x)$, then $g \setminus \{(\sigma(n),c)\}$ contains $(0,a)$ because $\sigma(n) \ne 0$, and is closed, because a generated pair $(\sigma(m),f(z))$ with $(m,z) \in g \setminus \{(\sigma(n),c)\}$ can equal $(\sigma(n),c)$ only if $\sigma(m) = \sigma(n)$ and $f(z) = c$, but $\sigma(m) = \sigma(n)$ forces $m = n$ by injectivity, then $z = x$ by uniqueness at $n$, giving $f(z) = f(x) \ne c$, a contradiction; hence $g \setminus \{(\sigma(n),c)\}$ is closed and smaller than $g$, contradicting minimality, so $f(x)$ is the unique value at $\sigma(n)$ and $\sigma(n) \in U$. [L2, step 3.1, step 1.1]

5.1 By induction $U = N$, so together with the totality from step 2.1 the relation $g$ is a function $g : N \to A$; it satisfies $g(0) = a$, and closure with uniqueness gives $g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n))$ for all $n$. [L1, step 2.1, step 3.1, step 4.1]

6.1 If $h : N \to A$ also satisfies $h(0) = a$ and $h(\sigma(n)) = f(h(n))$, then the set $\{ n : g(n) = h(n) \}$ contains $0$ and is closed under $\sigma$, since $g(n) = h(n)$ implies $g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n)) = f(h(n)) = h(\sigma(n))$, so by induction it equals $N$, that is $h = g$. [L1, step 5.1] ∎

## Statement

Let $(a_k)$, $(x_k)$ and $(b_k)$ be sequences of reals ([[def-sequence]]) with

$$a_k \le x_k \le b_k \quad \text{eventually},$$

and suppose $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ both converge to the same real $L$
([[def-real-limit]]). Then $(x_k)$ converges to $L$.

The middle sequence is not assumed to converge; that is the point of the
theorem, and it is why the squeeze is a tool for *establishing* convergence
rather than for computing a limit already known to exist.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $(a_k)$, $(x_k)$, $(b_k)$ of reals, an index $K_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ with $a_k \le x_k \le b_k$ for every $k \ge K_0$, and a real $L$ such that $(a_k)$ converges to $L$ and $(b_k)$ converges to $L$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L1] Convergence, quantified over rational $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-real-limit]]).

[L2] Absolute value: for $c > 0$, $|u| < c$ if and only if $-c < u < c$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L3] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: adding a constant preserves $<$ and $\le$; $u < v \le w$ and $u \le v < w$ both give $u < w$; and $\le$ is transitive ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L4] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total and transitive, so three indices $K_0, K_1, K_2$ admit an index $K$ with $K \ge K_0$, $K \ge K_1$ and $K \ge K_2$, and then $k \ge K$ gives $k \ge K_0$, $k \ge K_1$, $k \ge K_2$ ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be rational. By convergence of $(a_k)$ there is $K_1$ with $|a_k - L| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K_1$, and by convergence of $(b_k)$ there is $K_2$ with $|b_k - L| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K_2$. [L1]

2.1 By [L2], $|a_k - L| < \varepsilon$ gives $-\varepsilon < a_k - L$, that is $L - \varepsilon < a_k$, for all $k \ge K_1$; and $|b_k - L| < \varepsilon$ gives $b_k - L < \varepsilon$, that is $b_k < L + \varepsilon$, for all $k \ge K_2$. [step 1.1, L2, L3]

3.1 Choose $K$ with $K \ge K_0$, $K \ge K_1$ and $K \ge K_2$. For every $k \ge K$ the hypothesis gives $a_k \le x_k \le b_k$, so $L - \varepsilon < a_k \le x_k \le b_k < L + \varepsilon$, hence $L - \varepsilon < x_k < L + \varepsilon$, hence $-\varepsilon < x_k - L < \varepsilon$, hence $|x_k - L| < \varepsilon$. [step 2.1, given, L2, L3, L4, choose]

4.1 The rational $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary, so for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is an index $K$ beyond which $|x_k - L| < \varepsilon$; that is, $(x_k)$ converges to $L$. [step 3.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- The proof is direct from the definition and does not route through [[lem-limit-preserves-order]]. It could not: that lemma assumes the middle sequence converges, which is what is being proved here.

- Both bounding sequences must have the **same** limit. With $a_k = -1$, $b_k = 1$ and any $(x_k)$ taking values in $[-1, 1]$ the hypothesis $a_k \le x_k \le b_k$ holds and nothing whatever follows, since a bounded sequence need not converge ([[fs-bounded-implies-convergent]]).

- The most common use is with $a_k = -c_k$ and $b_k = c_k$ for a null sequence $(c_k)$: if $|x_k| \le c_k$ eventually and $c_k \to 0$, then $x_k \to 0$. That special case also follows from [[lem-null-times-bounded]] whenever $x_k$ is presented as a product of a null sequence and a bounded one, but the squeeze needs no such presentation.

## Statement

Every nonempty subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ has a least element: there is $\ell \in S$ with $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A nonempty subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. Define $T = \{\, n \in \mathbb{N} : \text{every } m \text{ with } m \le n \text{ satisfies } m \notin S \,\}$ (informally, no element of $S$ is $\le n$).

[L1] Induction principle: a subset of $\mathbb{N}$ that contains $0$ and is closed under $\sigma$ equals $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L2] $m < n \iff \sigma(m) \le n$; consequently no $k$ satisfies $n < k < \sigma(n)$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]).

[L3] Exactly one of $s < n$, $s = n$, $n < s$ holds ([[lem-nat-trichotomy]]); and $n < s \iff \sigma(n) \le s$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]).

[L4] $\sigma$ is injective (Peano axiom P2) ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]).

[L5] $\sigma(a) + i = \sigma(a + i)$ for all $a, i$ (the left successor law, [[lem-nat-add-successor-left]]).

[L6] $0 + k = k$ for all $k$ ([[lem-nat-add-identity]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose $S$ is nonempty but has no least element. [assume-contra]

1.2 If $m < \sigma(n)$ then $m \le n$: by [L2] applied to $m$ and $\sigma(n)$ we get $\sigma(m) \le \sigma(n)$, say $\sigma(m) + i = \sigma(n)$; then $\sigma(m + i) = \sigma(m) + i = \sigma(n)$ [L5], so $m + i = n$ by injectivity [L4], hence $m \le n$. [L2, L4, L5]

2.1 First, $0 \in T$: if $0 \in S$ then $0 \le s$ for all $s \in S$, since $0 + s = s$ [L6], making $0$ a least element, contrary to the assumption; hence $0 \notin S$; moreover $m \le 0$ forces $m = 0$, because $m \ne 0$ would give $0 < m$ (as $0 + m = m$ [L6] with $m \ne 0$) while $m \le 0$ gives $m < 0$, and [L3] admits at most one of these; so every $m \le 0$ lies outside $S$. [step 1.1, L3, L6, given]

2.2 Next, $T$ is closed under $\sigma$: assume $n \in T$; if $\sigma(n) \in S$ then no $s \in S$ satisfies $s < \sigma(n)$ (else $s \le n$ by step 1.2, so $s \notin S$ because $n \in T$, a contradiction), hence $\sigma(n) \le s$ for all $s \in S$ by [L3], making $\sigma(n)$ a least element, contrary to the assumption; therefore $\sigma(n) \notin S$, and any $m$ with $m \le \sigma(n)$ satisfies $m = \sigma(n)$ or $m \ne \sigma(n)$; in the second case $m \le \sigma(n)$ together with $m \ne \sigma(n)$ gives $m < \sigma(n)$ by the definition of the strict order, hence $m \le n$ by step 1.2 and $m \notin S$ because $n \in T$, while in the first case $m = \sigma(n) \notin S$; so every $m \le \sigma(n)$ lies outside $S$, giving $\sigma(n) \in T$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L3]

3.1 By the induction principle [L1], from $0 \in T$ and closure under $\sigma$, $T = \mathbb{N}$; then for every $n$, taking $m = n \le n$ shows $n \notin S$, so $S = \varnothing$, contradicting nonemptiness; therefore $S$ has a least element. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L1, discharge-contradiction] ∎
