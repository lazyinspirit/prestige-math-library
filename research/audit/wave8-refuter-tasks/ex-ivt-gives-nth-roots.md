## Example

Let $a \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a \ge 0$ and let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$.
Put $M := a + 1$ and consider

$$f : [0, M] \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad f(x) := x^{n}$$

([[def-integer-power]], [[def-interval]]). Then $f$ is continuous on $[0,M]$,
$f(0) = 0 \le a \le M^{n} = f(M)$, and the intermediate value theorem
([[thm-intermediate-value]]) supplies $c \in [0,M]$ with

$$c^{n} = a .$$

Moreover $c$ is the **only** nonnegative real with this property, so
$c = a^{1/n}$ in the notation of [[thm-nth-roots-exist]].

**This is a second proof of an existing theorem, not a new one.**
[[thm-nth-roots-exist]] already proves existence and uniqueness of $n$-th roots,
by an argument that runs directly from the least-upper-bound property and the
factorisation of $b^{n} - a^{n}$; it is the item the rest of the library cites,
and no second identifier is minted for the same statement. What is recorded here
is that the intermediate value theorem gives the existence half in three lines
once continuity of $x \mapsto x^{n}$ is available, which is the standard modern
route and the reason the theorem is usually met in this form.

**No circularity.** [[thm-intermediate-value]] rests on
[[thm-nested-interval-property]], on the algebra of continuous functions and on
the sequential criterion, none of which uses $n$-th roots; and the uniqueness
half below is [[lem-power-monotone]], which is pure ordered-field arithmetic. So
this argument could have been the library's definition of $a^{1/n}$; it is not,
only because the roots were needed at order $16$, long before continuity
existed.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real $a \ge 0$, a natural $n \ge 1$, and $M := a + 1$; the function $f(x) = x^{n}$ on $[0,M]$.

[L1] Polynomial functions, in particular $x \mapsto x^{n}$, are continuous on every subset of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], [[def-continuity-real]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L2] Intermediate value theorem: for $u \le v$, a function continuous on $[u,v]$ takes every value between $f(u)$ and $f(v)$ ([[thm-intermediate-value]]).

[L3] Powers and order: $0^{n} = 0$ for $n \ge 1$; if $t \ge 1$ and $n \ge 1$ then $t^{n} \ge t$; and $x \mapsto x^{n}$ is strictly increasing on the nonnegative reals for $n \ge 1$, hence injective there ([[lem-power-monotone]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L4] Existence and uniqueness of $n$-th roots: for $a \ge 0$ and $n \ge 1$ there is a unique $s \ge 0$ with $s^{n} = a$, written $a^{1/n}$ ([[thm-nth-roots-exist]]).

[L5] Ordered-field arithmetic: $a \ge 0$ gives $M = a + 1 \ge 1 > 0$ and $M > a$; and $0 \le M$ ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Verification

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $M = a + 1 \ge 1 > 0$ by [L5], so $[0,M]$ is a nonempty closed bounded interval, and $f$ is continuous on it by [L1]. [L1, L5]

1.2 $f(0) = 0^{n} = 0 \le a$ by [L3] and the hypothesis $a \ge 0$; and $f(M) = M^{n} \ge M = a + 1 > a$ by [L3] and [L5]. So $f(0) \le a \le f(M)$. [L3, L5]

2.1 By [L2] applied on $[0,M]$ with the value $a$, there is $c \in [0,M]$ with $c^{n} = a$; in particular $c \ge 0$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L2, choose]

3.1 $c$ is the only nonnegative real with $c^{n} = a$: by [L3] the map $t \mapsto t^{n}$ is injective on the nonnegative reals, so two nonnegative solutions would coincide. Hence $c = a^{1/n}$ in the notation of [L4], and the existence half of [L4] has been re-proved from the intermediate value theorem. [step 2.1, L3, L4] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why $M = a + 1$ and not $M = a$.** For $0 \le a < 1$ the value $a^{n}$ is at most $a$, so $[0,a]$ need not reach $a$ at its right endpoint; adding $1$ makes $M \ge 1$, and then $M^{n} \ge M > a$ by [[lem-power-monotone]]. Taking $M := \max\{1, a\}$ works equally well and is the usual textbook choice; $a+1$ avoids naming a maximum.

- **The same argument through the image.** [[cor-continuous-image-of-an-interval-is-an-interval]] says $f\bigl[\,[0,M]\,\bigr]$ is a closed bounded interval containing $f(0) = 0$ and $f(M) = M^{n}$, hence containing $a$; that is the intermediate value theorem repackaged, and it is the form in which the statement generalises to other continuous increasing functions.

- **What this does not give.** The argument produces a root but no way to compute it, and no rate: it is a pure existence proof, exactly like the bisection that underlies [[thm-intermediate-value]]. The companion example [[ex-fixed-point-from-the-ivt]] identifies the same number, for $n = 2$ and $a = 2$, as the fixed point of $x \mapsto (x + 2/x)/2$ on $[1,2]$.

This is a proof obligation and not an observation, and it is discharged by claim 2 of [[lem-power-laws]]: for $a \\ne 0$ in a field, $a^n \\ne 0$ for every $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, proved there by induction on $n$ from the fact that a field has no zero divisors ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]). That lemma is a statement *about* the operation introduced here, so it depends on this definition and is recorded in this item's `justified_by` rather than in its `deps` (SCHEMA §3). Given $a^n \\ne 0$, the value $(a^n)^{-1}$ is a single well-determined element, because multiplicative inverses in a field are unique ([[lem-of-inverse-unique]]). **Integer exponents.** Every integer $m$ ([[def-integers]]) is either $\\iota(n)$ or $-\\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$, where $\\iota$ is the embedding $\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]], [[def-int-operations]]). This too is a citation and not a slogan: the order on $\\mathbb{Z}$ is total ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), so $m \\ge 0$ or $m < 0$; the image of $\\iota$ is exactly the set of nonnegative integers, and each of them is $\\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]); and if $m < 0$ then $-m > 0$, by compatibility of the order with addition ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), so $-m = \\iota(n)$ and $m = -\\iota(n)$, with $n$ unique because $\\iota$ is injective. The two clauses above therefore define $a^m$ for every $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ whenever $a \\ne 0$, and for every $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$ for arbitrary $a$. The clauses are consistent where they overlap: the only overlap is $m = 0$, where $-\\iota(0) = \\iota(0)$ and $(a^0)^{-1} = 1^{-1} = 1 = a^0$.",

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $A$
([[def-continuity-real]]) and let $I \subseteq A$ be order-convex
([[def-interval]]). Then:

1. $f[I]$ is order-convex, hence connected
   ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]], [[def-connected-r]]);
2. if $I = [a,b]$ with $a \le b$, then $f[I] = [m, M]$ where
   $m = \min f[I]$ and $M = \max f[I]$ ([[def-max-min]]) — a **closed bounded
   interval**, degenerate exactly when $f$ is constant on $[a,b]$.

**"Interval" means "order-convex" here.** As [[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]]
records, this library proves that the connected subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ are
exactly the order-convex ones, and does **not** prove that every order-convex
subset is one of the nine written forms of [[def-interval]]. Claim 1 is
therefore stated as order-convexity, which is what the intermediate value
theorem delivers; claim 2 identifies the written form in the one case where the
extreme value theorem supplies the endpoints.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ continuous on $A$, and an order-convex set $I \subseteq A$.

[L1] Intermediate value theorem: if $u \le v$ in $\mathbb{R}$, if $f$ is continuous on $[u,v]$ and if $w$ lies between $f(u)$ and $f(v)$ in either order, then $f(t) = w$ for some $t \in [u,v]$ ([[thm-intermediate-value]]).

[L2] Continuity passes to subsets of the domain: if $B \subseteq A$ then $f|_B$ is continuous on $B$, since the defining condition quantifies over fewer points ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L3] Order-convexity: $x, z \in S$ and $x \le w \le z$ imply $w \in S$; every closed bounded interval $[u,v]$ with $u \le v$ is order-convex and is a subset of any order-convex set containing $u$ and $v$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L4] Connectedness: a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is connected if and only if it is order-convex ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]], [[def-connected-r]]).

[L5] $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$ is nonempty, closed and bounded ([[def-interval]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-bounded-set]]), hence compact ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L6] Extreme value theorem: a continuous real function on a nonempty compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ attains a greatest and a least value on it ([[thm-extreme-value-r]], [[def-max-min]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Claim 1.** Let $u', v' \in f[I]$ and let $w$ satisfy $u' \le w \le v'$. Write $u' = f(p)$ and $v' = f(q)$ with $p, q \in I$, and let $[s,t]$ be the closed bounded interval with $\{s,t\} = \{p,q\}$ and $s \le t$; by [L3] and order-convexity of $I$ we have $[s,t] \subseteq I \subseteq A$. [L3, choose]

1.2 **Claim 2, the endpoints.** Suppose $I = [a,b]$ with $a \le b$. By [L5] the set $[a,b]$ is nonempty and compact, so by [L6] there are $q, p \in [a,b]$ with $f(q) \le f(x) \le f(p)$ for every $x \in [a,b]$; put $m := f(q)$ and $M := f(p)$, so $m = \min f[I]$ and $M = \max f[I]$ and $m \le M$. [L5, L6, choose]

2.1 By [L2] the restriction of $f$ to $[s,t]$ is continuous on $[s,t]$, and $w$ lies between $f(s)$ and $f(t)$ in one order or the other, since $\{f(s), f(t)\} = \{u', v'\}$ and $u' \le w \le v'$. By [L1] there is $c \in [s,t] \subseteq I$ with $f(c) = w$, so $w \in f[I]$. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

3.1 So $f[I]$ is order-convex, and by [L4] it is connected. This is claim 1. [step 2.1, L4]

4.1 **Claim 2, the two inclusions.** Every $z \in f[I]$ satisfies $m \le z \le M$ by step 1.2, so $f[I] \subseteq [m,M]$. Conversely, $m$ and $M$ lie in $f[I]$ and $f[I]$ is order-convex by step 3.1, so every $w$ with $m \le w \le M$ lies in $f[I]$; hence $[m,M] \subseteq f[I]$. Therefore $f[I] = [m,M]$, a closed bounded interval, and it is the single point $\{m\}$ exactly when $m = M$, that is exactly when $f$ is constant on $[a,b]$. [step 3.1, step 1.2, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **The two halves come from the two theorems.** Order-convexity of the image is the intermediate value theorem and needs nothing else; that the image of a *closed bounded* interval is again closed and bounded is the extreme value theorem, and it fails for other interval forms: the continuous image of $(0,1)$ under $x \mapsto 1/x$ is $(1,\infty)$, and under $x \mapsto x$ it is $(0,1)$, neither closed.

- **The converse of claim 1 is false.** A function whose image on every subinterval is order-convex need not be continuous; this is the intermediate value property without continuity, and the witness for it is not available at this point in the reading order. What *is* true, and is proved on this page, is that a function which is monotone and has an order-convex image is continuous ([[lem-monotone-with-interval-image-is-continuous]]).

- **Claim 2 is the shape the $n$-th-root example uses.** Applying it to $x \mapsto x^{n}$ on $[0, a+1]$ gives an interval containing $0$ and $(a+1)^{n} \ge a$, hence containing $a$; that is the second proof of the existence of $n$-th roots recorded in [[ex-ivt-gives-nth-roots]] on the companion page.

## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq F$.

- $u \in F$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$; $S$ is
  **bounded above** if it has an upper bound.
- $u \in F$ is a **least upper bound** (or **supremum**, $\sup S$) of $S$ if $u$
  is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le u'$ for every upper bound $u'$ of $S$.

$F$ is a **complete ordered field** (equivalently, $F$ has the
**least-upper-bound property**, or is **Dedekind complete**) if every nonempty
$S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$.

## Remarks

- A least upper bound, if it exists, is unique (two least upper bounds are each
  $\le$ the other, so equal by antisymmetry of the order).
- Applying the property to $\{-s : s \in S\}$ yields the dual **greatest lower
  bound** (infimum) property, so the two are equivalent.
- The Dedekind-cut reals have this property by construction
  ([[thm-dedekind-complete]]); the Cauchy-sequence reals acquire it via
  [[cor-cauchy-reals-lub-complete]]. This definition is the target for the
  uniqueness theorem [[thm-uniqueness-complete-ordered-field]].

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field with its order and
absolute value ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]), and
neighbourhoods are those of [[def-neighbourhood-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Then
$f$ is **continuous at $c$** when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

with $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ ranging over the **positive reals**. In the
language of neighbourhoods: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ with

$$f\bigl(A \cap N_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \;\subseteq\; N_{\varepsilon}\bigl(f(c)\bigr).$$

$f$ is **continuous on $A$** when it is continuous at every point of $A$.

**The point $c$ is required to lie in $A$, and the condition is unpunctured.**
Both differ from [[def-function-limit]], and deliberately. There the quantifier
runs over $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, which removes $x = c$; here $x = c$ is allowed,
and at $x = c$ the implication reads $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$, which is
automatic. So allowing $x = c$ costs nothing, and it is what lets the definition
be stated at every point of $A$, including the points where no limit exists.

**Three clauses, and all three are part of the definition.**

1. **At a limit point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is a limit point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]). Then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if the
   limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) \;=\; f(c)$$
   ([[def-function-limit]]). Indeed, for a given $\varepsilon > 0$ a $\delta$
   witnessing continuity witnesses the limit condition, because the limit
   condition quantifies over a subset of the points continuity quantifies over;
   and conversely a $\delta$ witnessing $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$ witnesses
   continuity, because the one point it omits, $x = c$, satisfies
   $|f(c) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ anyway.

2. **At an isolated point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is an isolated point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so that $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ for some real
   $\eta > 0$. Then **every** $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$: take
   $\delta := \eta$, so that the only $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ is $c$
   itself, and $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$.

3. **On a set.** Continuity on $A$ is continuity at each point of $A$, and
   nothing more. It is not a condition relating $f$ to points outside $A$.

Every point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$,
and never both ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so clauses 1 and 2 between them describe
continuity at every point of $A$.

**This is not the raw $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula of
[[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]].** That item records what goes
wrong when the *punctured* formula of [[def-function-limit]] is written down at
an arbitrary point of the domain: at an isolated point it is satisfied
vacuously by every real $L$ at once, so it defines nothing, and this library
therefore leaves $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ **undefined** at an isolated point.
Continuity at an isolated point is a different matter: the formula above is not
vacuous — it is a genuine condition on $f(c)$, satisfied because $f(c)$ is the
only value being compared with itself — and it names a single, well-defined
property. The limit is undefined there; the continuity is defined, and is
automatic. Clause 1 is the only place where the two notions meet, and it is
stated only where the limit exists as a notion.

**Where the distinction disappears.** If $A$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), then every $c \in A$ has some
$N_{\eta}(c) \subseteq A$, and a punctured neighbourhood is never empty
([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), so every point of $A$ is a limit point of $A$ and
clause 1 covers the whole of $A$. The same holds when $A$ is a nondegenerate
interval ([[def-interval]]). Isolated points are what force clause 2 to exist at
all, and they occur as soon as $A$ is allowed to be an arbitrary subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, as in $A = \{0\} \cup [1,2]$.

## Remarks

- **Continuity is local.** If $\eta > 0$ and $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agrees with
  $f$ on $A \cap N_{\eta}(c)$, then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if $g$
  is: any $\delta$ may be replaced by $\min\{\delta, \eta\}$, after which the
  condition only ever evaluates the two functions where they agree. So
  continuity at $c$ sees only an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of $c$, exactly
  as the limit does ([[lem-limit-is-local]]).

- **Continuity passes to subsets of the domain.** If $B \subseteq A$ and
  $c \in B$, then continuity of $f$ at $c$ gives continuity of the restriction
  $f|_B$ at $c$, with the same $\delta$: the condition on $f|_B$ quantifies over
  fewer points. The converse fails, and the standard witness is the indicator of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ restricted to $\mathbb{Q}$, which is constant and hence
  continuous, while the indicator itself is continuous nowhere
  ([[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]]).

- **The radius is a real number.** As in [[def-neighbourhood-r]], $\varepsilon$
  and $\delta$ range over the positive reals here. Restricting either quantifier
  to the positive rationals defines the same relation, by the passage recorded
  in [[def-function-limit]]: below every positive real lies a positive rational
  ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and a real $\delta$ may be shrunk to a rational
  one below it.

- **The word *continuous* is used for two things in this library, and they
  agree.** [[def-metric-continuity]] defines continuity of a map between metric
  spaces, and $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ carries the metric $d(x,y) = |x-y|$. The
  two notions coincide, and that is proved, not assumed:
  [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]] is the dictionary, and it is stated on
  this page precisely so that no later item has to guess.

## Definition

Let $a \in \mathbb{R}$, where $\mathbb{R}$ is the ambient ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]).

**Natural exponents.** By the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) applied to
the set $\mathbb{R}$, the starting element $1$ and the function
$f(x) = x \cdot a$, there is a unique function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$,
written $n \mapsto a^n$, with

$$a^0 = 1, \qquad a^{n+1} = a^n \cdot a \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Thus $a^1 = a$, $a^2 = a \cdot a$, and so on. Note that this is defined for
**every** $a$, including $a = 0$.

**Negative exponents.** If $a \ne 0$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, set

$$a^{-n} := (a^n)^{-1}.$$

**Why that is legitimate.** The right-hand side presupposes that $a^n$ is
invertible, that is, that $a^n \ne 0$. This is a proof obligation and not an
observation, and it is discharged by claim 2 of [[lem-power-laws]]: for $a \ne 0$
in a field, $a^n \ne 0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, proved there by induction on
$n$ from the fact that a field has no zero divisors ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]).
That lemma is a statement *about* the operation introduced here, so it depends on
this definition and is recorded in this item's `justified_by` rather than in its
`deps` (SCHEMA §3). Given $a^n \ne 0$, the value $(a^n)^{-1}$ is a single
well-determined element, because multiplicative inverses in a field are unique
([[lem-of-inverse-unique]]).

**Integer exponents.** Every integer $m$ ([[def-integers]]) is either
$\iota(n)$ or $-\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$, where $\iota$ is the
embedding $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]],
[[def-int-operations]]). This too is a citation and not a slogan: the order on
$\mathbb{Z}$ is total ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), so $m \ge 0$ or $m < 0$; the
image of $\iota$ is exactly the set of nonnegative integers, and each of them is
$\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]); and if $m < 0$ then
$-m > 0$, by compatibility of the order with addition ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]),
so $-m = \iota(n)$ and $m = -\iota(n)$, with $n$ unique because $\iota$ is
injective. The two clauses above therefore define $a^m$ for every
$m \in \mathbb{Z}$ whenever $a \ne 0$, and for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$ for
arbitrary $a$. The clauses are consistent where they overlap: the only overlap is
$m = 0$, where $-\iota(0) = \iota(0)$ and $(a^0)^{-1} = 1^{-1} = 1 = a^0$.

## Remarks

- **The convention $0^0 = 1$ is adopted here**, and it is not a matter of taste
  but of agreement with the recursion above: $a^0 = 1$ is the starting value for
  every $a$, exactly as the empty product is $1$ ([[def-finite-sum]]). This is
  the convention that makes the empty product, the binomial theorem, and
  polynomial notation $\sum_k c_k x^k$ work at $x = 0$ without an exception. The
  competing convention "$0^0$ undefined" belongs to contexts where $x^y$ is
  studied as a function of two *real* variables and one wants continuity, which
  is unavailable and irrelevant here: the exponent in $a^m$ is an integer, never
  a real.
- $0^n = 0$ for every $n \ge 1$, since $0^{n} = 0^{n-1} \cdot 0 = 0$, a product
  with a zero factor ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]); and
  $0^{-n}$ is not defined for $n \ge 1$, since $0$ has no inverse.
- The exponent is an integer and stays an integer. Rational exponents are a
  separate construction resting on the existence of roots
  ([[thm-nth-roots-exist]], [[def-rational-power]]), and real exponents do not
  exist in this library yet ([[rem-real-exponents-deferred]]).
- The laws $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$ are
  proved, not assumed, in [[lem-power-laws]]; the order behaviour of $a \mapsto a^n$
  is [[lem-power-monotone]].

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ ([[def-field]]) together with a subset
$P \subseteq F$, the set of **positive** elements (the *positive cone*),
satisfying:

- **(O1) Trichotomy.** For each $x \in F$, exactly one of the following holds:
  $x \in P$, or $x = 0$, or $-x \in P$.
- **(O2) Closure.** If $x, y \in P$ then $x + y \in P$ and $x \cdot y \in P$.

We write $x > 0$ for $x \in P$ (read "$x$ is positive"), and define the order by

$$a < b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; b - a \in P, \qquad a \le b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; a < b \text{ or } a = b.$$

Thus $a > b$ means $b < a$, and $a \ge b$ means $b \le a$. An element $x$ with
$-x \in P$ (equivalently $x < 0$) is called **negative**.

## Remarks

- By trichotomy applied to $b - a$, for any $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$,
  $a = b$, $a > b$ holds; this makes $\le$ a total order.
- (O2) says the positives are closed under addition and multiplication: sums and
  products of positives are positive.
- The rationals ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and both constructions of the reals
  ([[thm-reals-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-dedekind-ordered-field]]) are ordered
  fields, so every fact proved here from (O1)-(O2) holds in each of them.

## Example

Let

$$\varphi : [1,2] \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad \varphi(x) := \frac{1}{2}\Bigl(x + \frac{2}{x}\Bigr)$$

([[def-interval]]). Then:

1. $\varphi$ is continuous on $[1,2]$ ([[def-continuity-real]]);
2. $\varphi(x) \in [1,2]$ for every $x \in [1,2]$;
3. by [[thm-one-dimensional-fixed-point]], $\varphi$ has a fixed point in
   $[1,2]$; and
4. that fixed point is **unique** and equals $\sqrt{2} = 2^{1/2}$
   ([[thm-nth-roots-exist]]).

**What the example is for.** It is the smallest nontrivial instance of the
one-dimensional fixed point theorem in which the fixed point can be *named*, and
it shows that the theorem, which asserts existence only, may be combined with an
algebraic identity to pin the point down. The identity is elementary:
$\varphi(c) = c$ says $c + 2/c = 2c$, that is $c^{2} = 2$.

**No derivative is used, and none is available at this point in the reading
order.** The usual argument that $\varphi$ maps $[1,2]$ into itself computes the
minimum of $\varphi$ by differentiation; the two-line order estimate of step 1.2
below replaces it. The same map is treated as a contraction of $[1,2]$ in
[[ex-banach-fixed-point-for-square-roots]], where the Banach fixed point theorem
gives the same point together with an error bound after $n$ iterations; that
route needs completeness of the metric subspace, this one needs only the
intermediate value theorem.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The interval $[1,2]$ and the function $\varphi(x) = \tfrac{1}{2}(x + 2/x)$ on it.

[L1] Algebra of continuous functions: the identity and constants are continuous, sums and scalar multiples of continuous functions are continuous, and the reciprocal of a continuous nowhere-vanishing function is continuous ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L2] One-dimensional fixed point theorem: a continuous $\varphi : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ with $a \le b$ and $\varphi(x) \in [a,b]$ for all $x \in [a,b]$ has a fixed point in $[a,b]$ ([[thm-one-dimensional-fixed-point]], [[thm-intermediate-value]]).

[L3] Reciprocals and order: for $1 \le x \le 2$ one has $0 < x$, hence $1/2 \le 1/x \le 1$ and so $1 \le 2/x \le 2$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L4] Square roots: for $a \ge 0$ there is a unique $s \ge 0$ with $s^{2} = a$, written $a^{1/2} = \sqrt{a}$; and $t \mapsto t^{2}$ is strictly increasing on the nonnegative reals ([[thm-nth-roots-exist]], [[lem-power-monotone]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L5] Ordered-field arithmetic: $1 \le 2$; halving preserves order; and $1^{2} = 1 \le 2 \le 4 = 2^{2}$ ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-integer-power]]).

## Verification

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Claim 1.** On $[1,2]$ the identity is continuous and does not vanish, since $x \ge 1 > 0$; so $x \mapsto 2/x$ is continuous there by [L1], and $\varphi = \tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(\mathrm{id} + 2/\mathrm{id}\bigr)$ is continuous on $[1,2]$ as a scalar multiple of a sum of continuous functions. [L1, L3]

1.2 **Claim 2.** Let $x \in [1,2]$. By [L3] we have $1 \le 2/x \le 2$, and by hypothesis $1 \le x \le 2$; adding, $2 \le x + 2/x \le 4$, and halving gives $1 \le \varphi(x) \le 2$ by [L5]. So $\varphi(x) \in [1,2]$. [L3, L5]

2.1 **Claim 3.** By [L2], applied with $a := 1$, $b := 2$ and the map $\varphi$, which is continuous by step 1.1 and maps $[1,2]$ into itself by step 1.2, there is $c \in [1,2]$ with $\varphi(c) = c$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L2, choose]

3.1 **Every fixed point squares to $2$.** Let $c \in [1,2]$ satisfy $\varphi(c) = c$. Then $c \ge 1 > 0$, so multiplying $\tfrac{1}{2}(c + 2/c) = c$ by $2c$ gives $c^{2} + 2 = 2c^{2}$, that is $c^{2} = 2$. [step 2.1, L3, L5]

4.1 **Claim 4.** By [L4] there is exactly one nonnegative real whose square is $2$, namely $\sqrt{2}$; since every fixed point $c$ is $\ge 1 > 0$ and satisfies $c^{2} = 2$ by step 3.1, the fixed point is unique and equals $\sqrt{2}$. And $\sqrt{2}$ does lie in $[1,2]$: from $1^{2} = 1 \le 2 \le 4 = 2^{2}$ and the strict monotonicity of $t \mapsto t^{2}$ on the nonnegative reals ([L4], [L5]) one gets $1 \le \sqrt{2} \le 2$. [step 3.1, L4, L5] ∎

## Remarks

- **A sharper bound, from a square.** For $x > 0$ one has $\bigl(\sqrt{x} - \sqrt{2/x}\bigr)^{2} \ge 0$, and expanding gives $x + 2/x \ge 2\sqrt{2}$, so $\varphi(x) \ge \sqrt{2}$ for every $x > 0$. That is the same identity [[ex-banach-fixed-point-for-square-roots]] uses, and it shows that $\varphi$ maps $(0,\infty)$ into $[\sqrt{2}, \infty)$; the crude estimate of step 1.2 is all that claim 2 needs, and it avoids square roots entirely.

- **Existence and identification are separate steps.** [[thm-one-dimensional-fixed-point]] gives claim 3 with no information about where the point is; claim 4 is pure algebra and would be equally valid if no fixed point existed, since it only says *which* number a fixed point must be. It is the combination that names $\sqrt{2}$.

- **The interval matters.** On $[-2,-1]$ the same formula has the fixed point $-\sqrt{2}$, and on an interval straddling $0$ the map is not even defined. Choosing $[1,2]$ is what makes claim 2 true and isolates the positive root.

## Statement

Let $\mathbb{R}$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]), let
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $n \in \mathbb{N}$, with powers as in
[[def-integer-power]].

1. **Signs.** If $a \ge 0$ then $a^n \ge 0$, and if $a > 0$ then $a^n > 0$.
2. **Strict monotonicity in the base.** If $0 \le a < b$ and $n \ge 1$ then $a^n < b^n$. Consequently, for $a, b \ge 0$ and $n \ge 1$: $a < b \iff a^n < b^n$ and $a \le b \iff a^n \le b^n$, and $x \mapsto x^n$ is injective on $\{x \in \mathbb{R} : x \ge 0\}$.
3. **Comparison with the base.** If $a \ge 1$ and $n \ge 1$ then $a^n \ge a \ge 1$; if $a > 1$ and $n \ge 1$ then $a^n \ge a > 1$; and if $0 \le a \le 1$ then $a^n \le 1$.
4. **Monotonicity in the exponent.** If $a > 1$ then $a^m < a^n$ whenever $m < n$ in $\mathbb{N}$; if $a = 1$ then $a^n = 1$ for all $n$; and if $0 < a < 1$ then $a^m > a^n$ whenever $m < n$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $\mathbb{R}$, elements $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and naturals $m, n$.

[L1] Definition of powers ([[def-integer-power]]): $a^0 = 1$ and $a^{n+1} = a^n a$.

[L2] Induction principle ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L3] Sign and scaling rules: a product of positives is positive, and for $c > 0$, $x < y \iff cx < cy$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]); the positives are closed under addition and satisfy trichotomy ([[def-ordered-field]]); and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]], which is where that fact is proved: neither of the two items just named states it).

[L4] Multiplying inequalities of nonnegatives: if $0 \le x \le y$ and $0 \le u \le v$ then $xu \le yv$, and if $0 < x < y$ and $0 < u < v$ then $xu < yv$ ([[prop-of-multiply-inequalities]]).

[L5] Trichotomy and transitivity of the order: for $x, y$ exactly one of $x < y$, $x = y$, $y < x$ holds, and $<$ and $\le$ are transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L6] The order on the exponents: $m \le n$ holds exactly when $n = m + k$ for some natural $k$ ([[def-nat-order]]), and $m < n$ holds exactly when $m + 1 \le n$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]); combining the two, $m < n$ holds exactly when $n = m + d$ for some natural $d \ge 1$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 0$: $a^0 = 1 > 0$, so claim 1 holds; claim 2 is vacuous at $n = 0$; $a^0 = 1 \ge 1$ and $a^0 = 1 \le 1$, so claim 3 holds at $n = 0$ in the nonstrict readings. [base, L1, L3]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume, for all $a, b$: $a \ge 0 \Rightarrow a^n \ge 0$ and $a > 0 \Rightarrow a^n > 0$; and $0 \le a \le b \Rightarrow a^n \le b^n$, with $a^n < b^n$ when moreover $a < b$ and $n \ge 1$. [ih]

2.1 Signs at $n+1$: if $a \ge 0$ then $a^{n+1} = a^n a$ is a product of two nonnegatives, hence $\ge 0$, and if $a > 0$ it is a product of two positives, hence $> 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L3, L4]

3.1 Strict monotonicity at $n+1$, assuming $0 \le a < b$: then $b > 0$, and the hypothesis gives $0 \le a^n \le b^n$ with $b^n > 0$ by step 2.1; if $a = 0$ then $a^{n+1} = 0 < b^{n+1}$ since $b^{n+1} = b^n b > 0$; if $a > 0$ then $a^{n+1} = a^n a \le b^n a$ by multiplying $a^n \le b^n$ by $a > 0$, and $b^n a < b^n b$ by multiplying $a < b$ by $b^n > 0$, so $a^{n+1} < b^{n+1}$ by transitivity; and in either case $0 \le a \le b$ gives $a^{n+1} \le b^{n+1}$ by [L4]. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L1, L3, L4, L5]

4.1 By the induction principle, claims 1 and 2 hold for every $n$, in the form: $a \ge 0 \Rightarrow a^n \ge 0$; $a > 0 \Rightarrow a^n > 0$; and $0 \le a < b$ with $n \ge 1$ gives $a^n < b^n$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 3.1, L2]

5.1 The equivalences of claim 2 follow by trichotomy: for $a, b \ge 0$ and $n \ge 1$, if $a^n < b^n$ then neither $a = b$ (which would give $a^n = b^n$) nor $b < a$ (which would give $b^n < a^n$) is possible, so $a < b$; the $\le$ form is the negation of the $<$ form with $a$ and $b$ exchanged; and injectivity is the case $a^n = b^n$, where $a < b$ and $b < a$ are both excluded. [step 4.1, L5]

5.2 Claim 4: for $a > 1$ we have $a^{n+1} = a^n a > a^n \cdot 1 = a^n$, multiplying $1 < a$ by $a^n > 0$, so $a^n$ is strictly increasing in $n$, and hence $a^m < a^n$ whenever $m < n$: writing $n = m + d$ with $d \ge 1$ and inducting on $d$, the case $d = 1$ is that one-step inequality and the passage from $d$ to $d+1$ is $a^m < a^{m+d} < a^{m+d+1}$ by transitivity; for $a = 1$ an induction gives $1^n = 1$ for all $n$; and for $0 < a < 1$ we have $a^{n+1} = a^n a < a^n \cdot 1 = a^n$, so $a^n$ is strictly decreasing in $n$ and the same induction on the gap $d$ gives $a^m > a^n$ for $m < n$. [step 4.1, L1, L2, L3, L5, L6]

6.1 Claim 3: if $a \ge 1$ and $n \ge 1$ then applying step 4.1 to $1 \le a$ gives $1 = 1^n \le a^n$, and $a^n = a^{n-1} a \ge 1 \cdot a = a$ since $a^{n-1} \ge 1$ by the same argument and $a > 0$; if $a > 1$ the same computation gives $a^n \ge a > 1$; and if $0 \le a \le 1$ then $a^n \le 1^n = 1$. [step 4.1, step 5.1, L1, L3, L4]

7.1 All four claims are proved: signs and strict monotonicity in the base by the induction of steps 1.1 and 3.1, the order equivalences and injectivity by trichotomy, and the comparisons with the base and the behaviour in the exponent by steps 6.1 and 5.2. [step 4.1, step 5.1, step 6.1, step 5.2, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$, let
$\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Suppose $f$ and $g$ are continuous at
$c$ ([[def-continuity-real]]). Then:

1. $f + g$, $\alpha f$ and $fg$ are continuous at $c$;
2. $|f|$, the function $x \mapsto |f(x)|$, is continuous at $c$;
3. $\max\{f,g\}$ and $\min\{f,g\}$, defined pointwise by
   $x \mapsto \max\{f(x), g(x)\}$ and $x \mapsto \min\{f(x), g(x)\}$
   ([[def-max-min]]), are continuous at $c$;
4. if $g(c) \ne 0$ then, writing $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$, the
   point $c$ lies in $A_0$ and the quotient
   $(f/g)|_{A_0} : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$, $x \mapsto f(x)/g(x)$, is continuous at
   $c$ as a function on $A_0$.

Moreover, with no hypothesis at all:

5. every constant function $A \to \mathbb{R}$ and the identity
   $\mathrm{id} : A \to \mathbb{R}$, $x \mapsto x$, are continuous on $A$; hence
   so is $x \mapsto x^{n}$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$
   ([[def-integer-power]]), and hence so is every **polynomial function**
   $x \mapsto a_0 + a_1 x + \dots + a_n x^{n}$ with real coefficients.

Consequently, if $f$ and $g$ are continuous **on** $A$ then so are $f+g$,
$\alpha f$, $fg$, $|f|$, $\max\{f,g\}$ and $\min\{f,g\}$, and
$(f/g)|_{A_0}$ is continuous on $A_0$.

**Claim 4 is stated on $A_0$ because $f/g$ is not defined where $g$ vanishes**,
and $g$ may well vanish at points of $A$ far from $c$. The hypothesis is
$g(c) \ne 0$, not "$g$ nowhere zero"; what it buys is that $c$ itself lies in
the smaller domain, which is what makes continuity there mean anything.

**Nothing here is proved through a sequence.** Claims 1 and 4 are read off from
[[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]], which is itself proved from $\varepsilon$
and $\delta$, and claims 2, 3 and 5 are proved directly below. So no choice
principle is used anywhere in this item.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, functions $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\alpha$, a point $c \in A$ at which $f$ and $g$ are continuous, and, for claim 4, the hypothesis $g(c) \ne 0$ together with $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$.

[L1] Continuity at $c$: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L2] A point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$, and never both; at an isolated point of its domain every function is continuous; at a limit point $c$ of $A$, continuity of $f$ at $c$ is exactly the statement that the limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and equals $f(c)$ ([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-function-limit]]).

[L3] Algebra of function limits at a limit point $c$ of $A$: if the limits of $f$ and $g$ at $c$ exist with values $L$ and $M$, then the limits of $f+g$, $\alpha f$ and $fg$ at $c$ exist with values $L+M$, $\alpha L$ and $LM$; and if $M \ne 0$ then $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$, and the limit of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$ exists and equals $L/M$ ([[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]]).

[L4] Sign preservation: if the limit of $g$ at a limit point $c$ of $A$ exists and is nonzero, then $c$ is a limit point of $A_0 = \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$ ([[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]]).

[L5] Reverse triangle inequality: $\bigl||u| - |v|\bigr| \le |u - v|$ ([[cor-of-reverse-triangle]]); and $|u| \ge 0$, $|u| = 0$ exactly when $u = 0$, $|uv| = |u||v|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L6] Maximum and minimum of a two-element set of reals exist ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]), and for all reals $u, v$ one has $\max\{u,v\} = \tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(u + v + |u-v|\bigr)$ and $\min\{u,v\} = \tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(u + v - |u-v|\bigr)$.

[L7] Ordered-field arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: trichotomy and totality of the order, the field identities, and $0 < 1$ so that $2 \ne 0$ and $t/2$ is defined ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]).

[L8] Integer powers: $a^{0} = 1$ and $a^{n+1} = a^{n} \cdot a$ ([[def-integer-power]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Justification of the identity in [L6].** Let $u, v \in \mathbb{R}$. By totality either $u \ge v$ or $v \ge u$. If $u \ge v$ then $u - v \ge 0$, so $|u-v| = u-v$ and $\tfrac{1}{2}(u+v+|u-v|) = \tfrac{1}{2}(2u) = u = \max\{u,v\}$, while $\tfrac{1}{2}(u+v-|u-v|) = v = \min\{u,v\}$. If $v \ge u$ the same computation with the roles exchanged applies, since $|u-v| = v-u$ there. [L5, L6, L7]

1.2 **The isolated case.** Suppose $c$ is an isolated point of $A$, say $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ with $\eta > 0$ real. Then every function on $A$ is continuous at $c$ by [L2], which gives claims 1, 2 and 3 at once. For claim 4, assume $g(c) \ne 0$; then $c \in A_0$, and $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A_0 \subseteq N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ with $c$ in the left-hand side, so $c$ is an isolated point of $A_0$ and every function on $A_0$, in particular $(f/g)|_{A_0}$, is continuous at $c$. [L2]

1.3 **Claim 2, at any point of $A$.** Let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given and let $\delta > 0$ be as in [L1] for $f$ and this $\varepsilon$. For $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ the reverse triangle inequality gives $\bigl||f(x)| - |f(c)|\bigr| \le |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$. So $|f|$ is continuous at $c$, and no case distinction was needed. [L1, L5]

1.4 **Claim 5, constants and the identity.** If $f$ is constant then $|f(x) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$ for every $x \in A$ and every real $\varepsilon > 0$, so any $\delta > 0$ serves. For the identity, given a real $\varepsilon > 0$ take $\delta := \varepsilon$: every $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ has $|\mathrm{id}(x) - \mathrm{id}(c)| = |x - c| < \varepsilon$. Both are continuous at every point of $A$. [L1, L5, L7]

1.5 **The limit-point case, claim 1.** Suppose $c$ is a limit point of $A$. By [L2] the limits of $f$ and of $g$ at $c$ exist and equal $f(c)$ and $g(c)$. By [L3] the limits of $f+g$, $\alpha f$ and $fg$ at $c$ exist and equal $f(c)+g(c)$, $\alpha f(c)$ and $f(c)g(c)$, which are exactly the values of those three functions at $c$; by [L2] again, each of them is continuous at $c$. [L2, L3]

1.6 **The limit-point case, claim 4.** Suppose $c$ is a limit point of $A$ and $g(c) \ne 0$. Then $c \in A_0$, and by [L4] the point $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$. By [L3] the limit of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$ exists and equals $f(c)/g(c)$, which is the value of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$; by [L2] applied on the domain $A_0$, that function is continuous at $c$. [L2, L3, L4]

2.1 **Claims 1 and 4 in general.** By [L2] the point $c$ is either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$; step 1.2 settles the first case and steps 1.5 and 1.6 the second. So claims 1 and 4 hold as stated. [step 1.2, step 1.5, step 1.6, L2]

3.1 **Claim 3.** By claim 1 the function $f - g = f + (-1)g$ is continuous at $c$, by step 1.3 so is $|f-g|$, and by claim 1 again so are $f + g + |f-g|$ and its scalar multiple by $1/2$. By step 1.1 that scalar multiple is the function $x \mapsto \max\{f(x), g(x)\}$, so the maximum is continuous at $c$; the same argument with $-|f-g|$ gives the minimum. [step 1.1, step 1.3, step 2.1, L6, L7]

3.2 **Claim 5, powers and polynomials.** The map $x \mapsto x^{0}$ is the constant $1$ and $x \mapsto x^{1}$ is the identity, both continuous on $A$ by step 1.4; and if $x \mapsto x^{n}$ is continuous on $A$ then so is $x \mapsto x^{n+1} = x^{n} \cdot x$, being a product of two functions continuous on $A$ by step 2.1. By induction on $n$, $x \mapsto x^{n}$ is continuous on $A$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. A polynomial function $a_0 + a_1x + \dots + a_nx^{n}$ is obtained from these by finitely many scalar multiplications and additions, each of which preserves continuity by step 2.1. [step 1.4, step 2.1, L8]

4.1 Claims 1 to 5 are proved, all of them at an arbitrary point $c$ of $A$ and therefore, applied at every point, on the whole of $A$; and no sequence and no choice principle was used. [step 1.3, step 2.1, step 3.1, step 3.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the two-case shape, and why it is not an inconvenience.** Continuity is defined at every point of the domain, including isolated points, where no limit exists ([[def-continuity-real]]). The algebra of limits therefore cannot be applied blindly; but at an isolated point every function is continuous, so the case is settled before it is opened. Claims 2 and 5 are proved directly from $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ and need no case distinction at all.

- **Absolute value, maximum and minimum are not in [[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]]**, and the reason is that they are not needed there. They are needed here: the extreme value theorem and the one-dimensional fixed point theorem both build auxiliary functions out of maxima, minima and differences, and [[thm-compactness-is-necessary-for-evt-and-uniform-continuity]] builds its witnesses out of $|x - x_0|$ and quotients.

- **The converse of claim 2 is false**: $|f|$ may be continuous while $f$ is continuous nowhere. The function equal to $1$ on $\mathbb{Q}$ and to $-1$ elsewhere has constant absolute value; that it is nowhere continuous follows from the argument of [[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]] applied verbatim, since that argument uses only that the two values are distinct.

## Statement

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a \le b$, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be
continuous on the closed bounded interval $[a,b]$ ([[def-interval]],
[[def-continuity-real]]), and let $y \in \mathbb{R}$ satisfy

$$f(a) \le y \le f(b) \qquad \text{or} \qquad f(b) \le y \le f(a) .$$

Then there is $c \in [a,b]$ with $f(c) = y$.

**The construction is canonical, so no choice principle is used.** The bisection
below tests the left half first and takes the right half only when the left one
has been ruled out, so the passage from one interval to the next is a *function*
of that interval, and [[thm-recursion]] applies with nothing selected. This is
the same discipline the library uses wherever a sequence is built one term at a
time.

**Completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ is what does the work.** The bisection produces a
nested sequence of closed bounded intervals whose lengths tend to $0$, and it is
[[thm-nested-interval-property]] — hence the least-upper-bound property — that
supplies the point. Over an ordered field that is not complete the theorem
fails; the witness for that, stated for an arbitrary ordered field and worked
over $\mathbb{Q}$, is
[[cex-evt-and-ivt-fail-over-a-non-complete-field]], which states its own
$\varepsilon$-$\delta$ continuity inline and is not an instance of this page's
definition.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a \le b$, a function $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ continuous on $[a,b]$, and a real $y$ with $f(a) \le y \le f(b)$ or $f(b) \le y \le f(a)$.

[L1] Scalar multiples of continuous functions are continuous, so $(-1)f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L2] Recursion: for a set $X$, an element $x_0 \in X$ and a function $F : X \to X$ there is a unique $g : \mathbb{N} \to X$ with $g(0) = x_0$ and $g(k+1) = F(g(k))$ for every $k$ ([[thm-recursion]]).

[L3] Nested intervals: if $I_k = [a_k,b_k]$ with $a_k \le b_k$ and $I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, then $\bigcap_{k} I_k$ is nonempty, and it is a single point exactly when the lengths $b_k - a_k$ tend to $0$ ([[thm-nested-interval-property]], [[def-interval]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L4] Null geometric sequences: $|r| < 1$ implies $r^{k} \to 0$; and a constant multiple of a null sequence is null, while a constant sequence converges to that constant ([[lem-geometric-sequence-null]], [[thm-algebra-of-limits]], [[def-integer-power]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L5] Powers: $(2^{-1})^{k} = (2^{k})^{-1}$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[lem-power-laws]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L6] Sequential criterion, the choice-free direction: if $f$ is continuous at $c$ and $x_k \in [a,b]$ with $x_k \to c$, then $f(x_k) \to f(c)$ ([[thm-sequential-criterion-for-continuity]], [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L7] Limits preserve non-strict inequalities ([[lem-limit-preserves-order]]).

[L8] Order and field arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: trichotomy and totality, so exactly one of $f(m) \ge y$ and $f(m) < y$ holds; halving and the ordered-field identities ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]); and $|t| \le s$ whenever $-s \le t \le s$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 **Reduction.** It is enough to prove the theorem under the hypothesis $f(a) \le y \le f(b)$. Indeed, in the remaining case $f(b) \le y \le f(a)$, put $h := (-1)f$ and $z := -y$; then $h$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ by [L1] and $h(a) = -f(a) \le -y = z \le -f(b) = h(b)$, so a point $c \in [a,b]$ with $h(c) = z$ is a point with $f(c) = y$. [L1, L8, suffices: assume f(a) le y le f(b)]

1.2 **The bisection map.** Assume $f(a) \le y \le f(b)$ and put $$X \;:=\; \bigl\{\, (u,v) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \ : \ a \le u \le v \le b,\ f(u) \le y \le f(v) \,\bigr\},$$ so $(a,b) \in X$. For $(u,v) \in X$ write $m := (u+v)/2$, which satisfies $a \le u \le m \le v \le b$ and so lies in $[a,b]$, and define $$F(u,v) \;:=\; \begin{cases} (u,\ m) & \text{if } f(m) \ge y,\\ (m,\ v) & \text{if } f(m) < y. \end{cases}$$ By trichotomy exactly one clause applies, so $F$ is a function on $X$; and $F(u,v) \in X$ in both clauses, since in the first $f(u) \le y \le f(m)$ and in the second $f(m) \le y \le f(v)$. **The left half is tested first and the right half is taken only when the left is excluded, so nothing is selected.** [L8, construct]

2.1 **The nested sequence.** By [L2] applied to $X$, the element $(a,b)$ and the map $F$, there is a unique $g : \mathbb{N} \to X$ with $g(0) = (a,b)$ and $g(k+1) = F(g(k))$. Write $g(k) = (a_k,b_k)$ and $I_k := [a_k,b_k]$. Then for every $k$: $a \le a_k \le b_k \le b$ and $f(a_k) \le y \le f(b_k)$, because $g(k) \in X$; and $I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k$, since in either clause of the definition of $F$ the new endpoints lie in $[a_k,b_k]$ and the new interval is $[a_k,m_k]$ or $[m_k,b_k]$ with $m_k = (a_k+b_k)/2$. [step 1.2, L2, L8]

3.1 **The lengths.** In both clauses the new length is $m_k - a_k = (b_k - a_k)/2$ or $b_k - m_k = (b_k - a_k)/2$, so $b_{k+1} - a_{k+1} = (b_k - a_k)/2$; with $b_0 - a_0 = b - a$ an induction on $k$ gives $b_k - a_k = (b-a)\,(2^{-1})^{k}$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, that is $(b-a)/2^{k}$ by [L5]. Since $|2^{-1}| < 1$, [L4] gives $(2^{-1})^{k} \to 0$ and hence $b_k - a_k \to 0$. [step 2.1, L4, L5, L8]

4.1 **The point.** By [L3] applied to the nested family $(I_k)$, whose lengths tend to $0$ by step 3.1, the intersection $\bigcap_k I_k$ is a single point; call it $c$. Then $c \in I_0 = [a,b]$ and $a_k \le c \le b_k$ for every $k$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L3, construct]

5.1 **The endpoints converge to $c$.** Let a rational $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. By step 3.1 there is $K$ with $b_k - a_k < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$. For such $k$, from $a_k \le c \le b_k$ we get $-(b_k - a_k) \le a_k - c \le 0$ and $0 \le b_k - c \le b_k - a_k$, so $|a_k - c| \le b_k - a_k < \varepsilon$ and $|b_k - c| \le b_k - a_k < \varepsilon$ by [L8]. Hence $a_k \to c$ and $b_k \to c$. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L8]

6.1 **Passing to the limit.** The point $c$ lies in $[a,b]$, so $f$ is continuous at $c$, and [L6] applied to the two sequences of step 5.1 gives $f(a_k) \to f(c)$ and $f(b_k) \to f(c)$. [step 4.1, step 5.1, L6]

7.1 By step 2.1, $f(a_k) \le y$ for every $k$; the constant sequence with value $y$ converges to $y$ by [L4], so [L7] gives $f(c) \le y$. Likewise $y \le f(b_k)$ for every $k$ gives $y \le f(c)$. Hence $f(c) = y$. [step 2.1, step 6.1, L4, L7, L8]

8.1 A point $c \in [a,b]$ with $f(c) = y$ has therefore been constructed, under the reduction of step 1.1 and hence in both cases of the hypothesis. [step 1.1, step 4.1, step 7.1, discharge-construct: c is the unique point of the nested intersection] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the left half is tested first.** The bisection has to choose one of two halves at every stage, and if the rule were "choose a half in which the sign change persists" the construction would be a dependent choice, not a recursion. Testing $f(m) \ge y$ and taking the left half in that case makes the successor a function of its predecessor, so [[thm-recursion]] applies verbatim. The same device is used in [[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]] and in the bisection proof of Heine-Borel.

- **What the theorem does *not* say.** It does not say that $c$ is unique, and it does not say that the set of solutions is an interval; $f$ may take the value $y$ on a complicated set. It also does not say that a function with the intermediate value property is continuous — that converse is false, and the witness for it needs machinery that is not available at this point in the reading order.

- **Only the choice-free direction of the sequential criterion is used.** Step 6.1 turns a convergent sequence into a convergent image sequence, which is the implication proved in ZF ([[thm-sequential-criterion-for-continuity]]); the converse, which spends countable choice, is never invoked here.

## Statement

For each $k \in \mathbb{N}$ let $I_k = [a_k, b_k]$ be a closed bounded interval
with $a_k \le b_k$ ([[def-interval]]), and suppose the family is **nested**:

$$I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k \qquad (k \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Write $\ell_k = b_k - a_k \ge 0$ for the length of $I_k$. Then:

1. $\displaystyle\bigcap_{k \in \mathbb{N}} I_k$ is **nonempty**. More precisely,
   with $a = \sup\{a_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$ and
   $b = \inf\{b_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$, both of which exist, one has $a \le b$
   and $$\bigcap_{k \in \mathbb{N}} I_k = [a, b].$$
2. $\displaystyle\bigcap_{k \in \mathbb{N}} I_k$ is a **single point** if and only
   if $\ell_k \to 0$ ([[def-real-limit]]).

Every hypothesis is load bearing. Dropping closedness makes the intersection
empty; dropping boundedness does the same; and dropping nonemptiness of the
individual intervals is vacuously fatal.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Closed bounded intervals $I_k = [a_k, b_k]$ with $a_k \le b_k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and $I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k$ for every $k$; the sequences $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ of reals ([[def-sequence]]); their ranges $A = \{a_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$ and $B = \{b_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$, both nonempty; and $\ell_k = b_k - a_k$.

[L1] Closed bounded intervals: $[a,b] = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : a \le x \le b\}$; it is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, it is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$, it has two distinct elements $a$ and $b$ when $a < b$, and its length is $b - a$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L2] Least-upper-bound property and uniqueness: a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ bounded above has a unique supremum; the supremum is an upper bound and is $\le$ every upper bound ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L4] Monotone sequences, and the fact that consecutive comparisons suffice: $x_k \le x_{k+1}$ for all $k$ makes $(x_k)$ nondecreasing, and $x_{k+1} \le x_k$ for all $k$ makes it nonincreasing ([[def-monotone-sequence]]).

[L8] Bounded above and bounded below, for a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-bounded-set]]).

[L9] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total and transitive, so any two indices $k, l$ admit an index $m$ with $k \le m$ and $l \le m$, namely the larger of the two ([[def-nat-order]], [[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Nestedness read on the endpoints: since $a_{k+1} \le b_{k+1}$, both $a_{k+1}$ and $b_{k+1}$ lie in $I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k$, so $a_k \le a_{k+1}$ and $b_{k+1} \le b_k$ for every $k$. [given, L1]

2.1 Hence $(a_k)$ is nondecreasing and $(b_k)$ is nonincreasing. [step 1.1, L4]

3.1 For all indices $k$ and $l$: choosing $m$ with $k \le m$ and $l \le m$ gives $a_k \le a_m \le b_m \le b_l$, so $a_k \le b_l$. [step 2.1, given, L9]

4.1 Every $b_l$ is therefore an upper bound of $A$ and every $a_k$ a lower bound of $B$; both sets are nonempty, so $a := \sup A$ and $b := \inf B$ exist and are unique. [step 3.1, L2, L3, L8]

5.1 $a \le b$: each $b_l$ is an upper bound of $A$, so $a \le b_l$ for every $l$ by leastness of the supremum; thus $a$ is a lower bound of $B$, and $a \le b$ by greatestness of the infimum. [step 4.1, L2, L3]

5.2 By monotone convergence, $a_k \to a$ and $b_k \to b$. [step 2.1, step 4.1, L5]

5.3 The intersection is exactly $[a,b]$: a real $x$ lies in every $I_k$ exactly when $a_k \le x \le b_k$ for every $k$, that is exactly when $x$ is an upper bound of $A$ and a lower bound of $B$, and by leastness of $a$ and greatestness of $b$ that holds exactly when $a \le x \le b$. [step 4.1, L1, L2, L3]

6.1 $\ell_k = b_k - a_k \to b - a$ by the algebra of limits. [step 5.2, L6]

6.2 Since $a \le b$, the interval $[a,b]$ is nonempty, so the intersection is nonempty; together with step 5.3 this is claim 1. [step 5.1, step 5.3, L1]

7.1 If $\ell_k \to 0$ then $b - a = 0$ by uniqueness of limits, so $a = b$ and the intersection is $[a,a] = \{a\}$, a single point. [step 5.3, step 6.1, L1, L7]

7.2 Conversely, if the intersection is a single point then $a = b$: it equals $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, and $a < b$ would give the two distinct elements $a$ and $b$. Hence $b - a = 0$ and $\ell_k \to 0$ by step 6.1. [step 5.1, step 5.3, step 6.1, L1]

8.1 Claim 1 is step 6.2 and claim 2 is the pair of implications in steps 7.1 and 7.2, so a nested sequence of nonempty closed bounded intervals has nonempty intersection, equal to $[a,b]$, and that intersection is a single point exactly when the lengths tend to $0$. [step 6.2, step 7.1, step 7.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **No Archimedean input is needed.** The lengths are handled entirely by the
  algebra of limits and the uniqueness of limits: $\ell_k$ always converges, to
  $b - a$, and the two directions of claim 2 are then the two directions of
  "$b - a = 0$". A proof that instead argues "if $b - a > 0$ then some $\ell_k$
  is smaller" does need the Archimedean property
  ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]]), and it is avoidable, so it is avoided.

- **Nestedness gives more than it is usually stated to give.** The intersection
  is not merely nonempty; it is the closed interval $[a,b]$, and $a$ and $b$ are
  the limits of the endpoint sequences. The single-point case is exactly the case
  in which those two limits agree, and that is what makes the nested interval
  property usable as a *construction* of a real number, as in
  [[ex-nested-intervals-single-point]].

- **This is one of the standard equivalents of completeness.** Nested intervals
  together with the Archimedean property imply the least-upper-bound property, so
  the implication proved here is not reversible for free: it is half of an
  equivalence whose other half needs the Archimedean hypothesis separately.
  [[rem-completeness-routes]] records where this library stands on those routes.

- **The witnesses for the two deleted hypotheses** are
  [[cex-nested-open-intervals-empty]], which keeps boundedness and drops
  closedness, and [[cex-nested-unbounded-closed-empty]], which keeps closedness
  and drops boundedness. Neither is used above; each shows that the corresponding
  hypothesis cannot be removed.

## Statement

Let $\mathbb{R}$ be a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).
For every $a \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a \ge 0$ and every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with
$n \ge 1$ there is a **unique** $s \in \mathbb{R}$ with $s \ge 0$ and $s^n = a$
([[def-integer-power]]); we write

$$s = a^{1/n} = \sqrt[n]{a}.$$

Moreover $a^{1/n} > 0$ when $a > 0$, and $a^{1/1} = a$.

**This generalises the published [[thm-of-square-roots]], and the case $n = 2$ is
not new.** That theorem already produces the unique $\sqrt{a} \ge 0$ with
$(\sqrt{a})^2 = a$, and it is cited as such throughout the library; the notation
$a^{1/2}$ introduced here is the same number. What is new is the passage to
general $n$: the completed square that drives the $n = 2$ argument has no direct
analogue, and its place is taken by the factorisation of $b^n - a^n$ and the
resulting Lipschitz estimate ([[lem-power-difference-factorisation]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), that is, an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with the least-upper-bound property; an element $a \ge 0$; and a natural $n \ge 1$, with $\iota(n) \in \mathbb{R}$ written $n$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[lem-of-q-embeds]]).

[L1] Least-upper-bound property: every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above ([[def-bounded-set]]) has a least upper bound, and it is unique, so the notation $\sup S$ is legitimate ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L2] Epsilon characterisation of the supremum: if $S$ is nonempty and bounded above and $u = \sup S$, then for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $t \in S$ with $u - \varepsilon < t$ ([[lem-sup-epsilon]]).

[L3] Monotonicity of powers ([[lem-power-monotone]]): $x \mapsto x^n$ is strictly increasing on $\{x \ge 0\}$ for $n \ge 1$, hence injective there; $x \ge 0$ implies $x^n \ge 0$ and $x > 0$ implies $x^n > 0$; and $x \ge 1$ implies $x^n \ge x$.

[L4] Lipschitz estimate ([[lem-power-difference-factorisation]]): if $0 \le x \le y \le B$ and $n \ge 1$ then $0 \le y^n - x^n \le n B^{\,n-1}(y - x)$.

[L5] Order arithmetic: adding a constant preserves the order and for $c > 0$, $x < y \iff cx < cy$ ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]]), both stated there for the STRICT order alone, so where a $\le$ is added or scaled below the move is that statement together with the case of equality, settled by trichotomy ([[def-ordered-field]]); $1 > 0$, which is proved in [[cor-of-one-positive]] and stated by none of those three, hence $2 = 1 + 1 > 0$; and $0 < 2^{-1} < 1$, since $0 < 1 < 2$ gives $0 < 2^{-1} < 1^{-1} = 1$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]], claim 2).

[L6] Trichotomy: for $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$ exactly one of $x < y$, $x = y$, $y < x$ holds; consequently any two elements have a minimum ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L7] A product with a zero factor vanishes: $0 \cdot x = x \cdot 0 = 0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 If $a = 0$ then $s = 0$ satisfies $s \ge 0$ and $s^n = 0 = a$, since $0^n = 0^{n-1} \cdot 0 = 0$ for $n \ge 1$; so existence holds in that case and we assume $a > 0$ from here on. [given, L3, L7, algebra]

1.2 Uniqueness holds as soon as a root exists: if $u, v \ge 0$ satisfy $u^n = v^n$, then strict monotonicity of $x \mapsto x^n$ on the nonnegatives rules out both $u < v$ and $v < u$, so $u = v$ by trichotomy. [L3, L6]

1.3 Define $S = \{t \in \mathbb{R} : t \ge 0 \text{ and } t^n \le a\}$; then $0 \in S$, because $0 \ge 0$ and $0^n = 0 \le a$, so $S$ is nonempty. [given, L3, L7]

1.4 The element $M := 1 + a$ is an upper bound of $S$: since $a > 0$ and $1 > 0$ we have $M > 1$ and $M > a$, so any $t > M$ satisfies $t > 1$, whence $t^n \ge t > M > a$ and $t \notin S$. [given, L3, L5]

2.1 By the least-upper-bound property $s := \sup S$ exists in $\mathbb{R}$; moreover $s \ge 0$ because $0 \in S$, and $s \le M$ because $M$ is an upper bound and $s$ is the least one. [L1, step 1.3, step 1.4]

3.1 Put $B := M + 1 = a + 2$; then $B > M \ge 1 > 0$, so $B^{\,n-1} > 0$ and $n B^{\,n-1} > 0$, and every $x$ with $0 \le x \le M + 1$ satisfies $0 \le x \le B$. [step 2.1, L3, L5]

3.2 Assume, for contradiction, that $s^n \ne a$; by trichotomy either $s^n < a$ or $s^n > a$. [assume-contra, step 2.1, L6]

4.1 (Case $s^n < a$.) Put $\delta := \min\{1, (a - s^n)(n B^{\,n-1})^{-1}\}$, which is $> 0$ since $a - s^n > 0$ and $n B^{\,n-1} > 0$, and put $h := 2^{-1}\delta$, so that $0 < h < \delta \le 1$ and $h < (a - s^n)(nB^{\,n-1})^{-1}$; then $0 \le s \le s + h \le M + 1 = B$, so the Lipschitz estimate gives $(s+h)^n - s^n \le nB^{\,n-1} h < a - s^n$, hence $(s+h)^n < a$ and $s + h \in S$, while $s + h > s$ contradicts that $s$ is an upper bound of $S$. [assume-case low, step 3.2, step 2.1, step 3.1, L4, L5, L6, choose]

4.2 (Case $s^n > a$.) Here $s > 0$, since $s = 0$ would give $s^n = 0 \le a$; put $\delta := \min\{s, (s^n - a)(nB^{\,n-1})^{-1}\} > 0$ and $h := 2^{-1}\delta$, so that $0 < h < s$ and $h < (s^n - a)(nB^{\,n-1})^{-1}$; then $0 \le s - h \le s \le B$, so the Lipschitz estimate gives $s^n - (s-h)^n \le nB^{\,n-1}h < s^n - a$, hence $(s-h)^n > a$; applying the epsilon characterisation with $\varepsilon = h$ produces $t \in S$ with $t > s - h \ge 0$, whence $t^n > (s-h)^n > a$ by strict monotonicity, contradicting $t \in S$. [assume-case high, step 3.2, step 2.1, step 3.1, L2, L3, L4, L5, L6, L7, choose]

5.1 Both cases of the disjunction in step 3.2 are impossible, so the assumption fails and $s^n = a$; this $s$ is the unique nonnegative $n$-th root of $a$ by step 1.2, it satisfies $s > 0$ when $a > 0$ because $s = 0$ would force $a = s^n = 0$, and at $n = 1$ the element $a$ itself is a nonnegative solution of $s^1 = a$, so $a^{1/1} = a$; writing $a^{1/n} = \sqrt[n]{a}$ for it, the case $n = 2$ recovers the already published $\sqrt{a}$ of [[thm-of-square-roots]]. [step 4.1, step 4.2, step 3.2, step 1.2, step 1.1, L3, L7, cases, discharge-contradiction] ∎
