## Statement

Assume the Axiom of Choice and the Axiom of Dependent Choice. Every open cover
of a paracompact Hausdorff space admits a locally finite partition of unity
subordinate to it.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Choice, dependent choice, a paracompact Hausdorff space $X$, and an open cover $\mathcal U$.

[L1] There are locally finite covers $\{V_s\}$, $\{W_s\}$ and $U_s\in\mathcal U$ with $\overline{V_s}\subseteq W_s\subseteq\overline{W_s}\subseteq U_s$ ([[lem-paracompact-hausdorff-cover-shrinking]]).

[L2] Every paracompact Hausdorff space is normal ([[thm-paracompact-hausdorff-implies-normal]]).

[L3] Under dependent choice, Urysohn's lemma separates disjoint closed sets in a normal space by a continuous map into $[0,1]$ ([[thm-urysohn-lemma]], clause 1).

[L4] If $\{f_s:X\to[0,\infty)\}_{s\in S}$ is a continuous family with locally finite cozero family and everywhere-positive sum $f=\sum_sf_s$, then the functions $\varphi_s=f_s/f$ form a partition of unity, with the same cozero sets and supports as the corresponding $f_s$ ([[lem-normalizing-a-locally-finite-positive-family]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 Apply [L1] to obtain $V_s,W_s,U_s$ as stated. [L1, construct]

2.1 By [L2], $X$ is normal. For each $s$, the closed sets $\overline{V_s}$ and $X\setminus W_s$ are disjoint, so [L3] gives a continuous $f_s:X\to[0,1]$ equal to $1$ on $\overline{V_s}$ and $0$ on $X\setminus W_s$. [step 1.1, L2, L3, choose]

3.1 The cozero set of $f_s$ lies in $W_s$, while its support lies in $\overline{W_s}\subseteq U_s$; since $\{W_s\}$ is locally finite, so is the cozero family. [step 1.1, step 2.1]

3.2 Because $\{V_s\}$ covers $X$ and $f_s=1$ on $V_s$, the pointwise sum $\sum_sf_s$ is positive everywhere. [step 1.1, step 2.1]

4.1 By [L4], the normalized functions $\varphi_s=f_s/(\sum_tf_t)$ form a locally finite partition of unity; their supports equal those of $f_s$, so step 3.1 makes the partition subordinate to $\mathcal U$. [step 3.1, step 3.2, L4, discharge-construct] ∎

## Definition

The **Axiom of Choice** (AC) is the following statement.

> Every family of nonempty sets has a choice function
> ([[def-choice-function]]).

Written out: for every set $\mathcal{F}$ all of whose members are nonempty,
there exists a function $g$ with domain $\mathcal{F}$ satisfying $g(S) \in S$ for
all $S \in \mathcal{F}$.

An equivalent formulation is that a product of nonempty sets is nonempty: if
$X_i \ne \emptyset$ for every $i \in I$, then $\prod_{i \in I} X_i \ne \emptyset$.
Here $\prod_{i \in I} X_i$ is the set of functions $f$ with domain $I$ such that
$f(i) \in X_i$ for every $i \in I$; when a family of nonempty sets is indexed by
itself, such an $f$ is precisely a choice function for it.

## Remarks

- **This is an axiom, not a theorem, and it is deliberately not derived here.**
  **Assume ZF is consistent.** Then AC is independent of the axioms of
  Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory: Gödel (1938) showed that ZF, if consistent, cannot
  refute it ([[rem-godel-constructible-universe]]), and Cohen (1963) showed that
  ZF, if consistent, cannot prove it ([[rem-cohen-forcing-ac-independent]]). The
  consistency hypothesis is not decoration and cannot be dropped: an inconsistent
  ZF proves everything, AC included, so both halves of the independence would
  fail. Nor can the hypothesis be discharged inside ZF. Both directions also
  require machinery (the constructible universe and forcing) that this library
  does not yet contain, so both are recorded with references rather than proved.
  [[fs-zorn-provable-in-zf]] carries the same consistency assumption explicitly
  in its Given; [[rem-choice-ledger]] records the weaker choice principles.
- Being an axiom, AC carries no well-definedness obligation, which is why this
  item has no `justified_by`.
- The case of a family listed by a natural number, which is the finite case once
  finiteness is defined, is a theorem of ZF and needs no axiom
  ([[lem-finite-choice]]). AC is exactly the extension of that theorem to
  arbitrary index sets, and the gap between the two is not a matter of degree:
  [[ex-russells-socks]] exhibits the difference concretely.
- "ZFC" abbreviates ZF together with AC. A result that invokes AC should say so
  where it is stated, so that a reader can tell which theorems are choice-free;
  that bookkeeping is the purpose of [[rem-choice-ledger]].
  [[rem-choice-strengths]] carries the narrower question of what the ultrafilter
  lemma costs, and on cited authority, and under the hypothesis that ZF is
  consistent, places that principle strictly between ZF and AC.

## Definition

Let $X$ be a set and let $R \subseteq X \times X$ be a binary relation on $X$.
Call $R$ **entire on $X$** when

$$\text{for every } x \in X \text{ there is } y \in X \text{ with } x \mathbin{R} y .$$

The **Axiom of Dependent Choice**, written $\mathrm{DC}$, is the following
statement.

> For every nonempty set $X$, every relation $R$ entire on $X$, and every
> $a \in X$, there is a sequence $x : \mathbb{N} \to X$ ([[def-sequence]],
> [[def-natural-numbers]]) with
> $$x_0 = a \qquad \text{and} \qquad x_n \mathbin{R} x_{n+1} \ \text{ for every } n \in \mathbb{N}.$$

As everywhere in this library $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$, and the sequence is
indexed from $0$; the term $x_0$ is the prescribed starting point $a$ and every
later term is related to its predecessor.

**What DC adds to what came before.** [[def-choice-function]] and
[[def-axiom-of-choice]] select one element from each member of a family that is
fixed in advance, and [[def-countable-choice]] does the same for a family indexed
by $\mathbb{N}$. In both, the family is given before any selection is made. DC is
the principle needed when the $n$-th set to select from is not known until the
first $n$ selections have been made: here the admissible values of $x_{n+1}$ are
exactly the $R$-successors of $x_n$, so the family being chosen from is built
along the choosing. That is precisely the situation $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ does not
cover, and it is why a construction "pick $x_{n+1}$ depending on $x_n$, for every
$n$ at once" is not licensed by countable choice.

**The starting point may be dropped.** The formally weaker statement obtained by
deleting the clause $x_0 = a$ — for every nonempty $X$ and every entire $R$ there
is a sequence with $x_n \mathbin{R} x_{n+1}$ for all $n$ — is an immediate
consequence of the form above, since $X$ is nonempty and any of its elements may
be taken as $a$. The reverse derivation is standard and is not needed anywhere in
this library, so it is not carried out; every use below prescribes $x_0$.

**$R$ need not be an order and the terms need not be distinct.** What DC delivers
is a sequence, that is a function $\mathbb{N} \to X$, not a chain in the
order-theoretic sense ([[def-chain]]). The relation may be symmetric, and the
sequence may repeat a value or be constant; all that is asserted is
$x_n \mathbin{R} x_{n+1}$ at every index.

## Remarks

**Where DC sits among the choice principles.** It is a standard fact, proved in
the references and **not** in this library, that

$$\mathrm{AC} \;\Longrightarrow\; \mathrm{DC} \;\Longrightarrow\; \mathrm{AC}_\omega ,$$

and that neither implication reverses. The non-reversals are relative-consistency
results: what they establish is that ZF, if consistent, does not prove the
missing implications, never that those implications are false. This library
contains neither forcing nor permutation models and proves no independence
result, so all of that is quoted from the references and used nowhere.

**Nothing in this library proves DC, and nothing assumes it silently.** Like
[[def-axiom-of-choice]] and [[def-countable-choice]], DC is a statement that may
be assumed or not. Every theorem whose proof uses it says so in its own
statement, and the accounting for the compactness page is collected in
[[rem-compactness-choice-ledger-metric]].

**An upper bound, never a lower one.** When a later item records that its proof
uses DC, the claim made is that the argument given here is carried out in
$\mathrm{ZF} + \mathrm{DC}$. No item claims that DC is *necessary* for the
statement proved, because establishing necessity means separating the statement
from ZF, and that is an independence result of exactly the kind this library does
not prove.

## Statement

Let $\{f_s:X\to[0,\infty)\}_{s\in S}$ be continuous with locally finite cozero
family, and suppose $f:=\sum_s f_s$ is positive at every point. Then
$\varphi_s:=f_s/f$ form a partition of unity; their cozero sets and supports are
the same as those of the corresponding $f_s$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A locally finite nonnegative continuous family whose pointwise sum is everywhere positive.

[L1] The sum $f=\sum_s f_s$ is continuous ([[lem-locally-finite-sums-are-continuous]]).

[L2] A quotient of continuous real-valued maps is continuous on the cozero set of its denominator ([[lem-algebra-of-continuous-real-maps-on-a-space]]).

[F1] A family of continuous maps $X\to[0,1]$ is a partition of unity exactly when its cozero family is locally finite and its pointwise sum is one ([[def-partition-of-unity-subordinate-to-a-cover]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L1] the function $f$ is continuous, and the positivity hypothesis makes $\operatorname{coz}(f)=X$. [L1]

2.1 Therefore each $\varphi_s=f_s/f$ is continuous by [L2] and nonnegative. Since $f_s(x)\le f(x)$, it takes values in $[0,1]$, and positivity of $f$ gives $\operatorname{coz}(\varphi_s)=\operatorname{coz}(f_s)$. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 At every $x\in X$, local finiteness makes the sum finite and gives $\sum_s\varphi_s(x)=\sum_sf_s(x)/f(x)=f(x)/f(x)=1$. [step 2.1]

4.1 The cozero family is unchanged, hence locally finite, and equality of cozero sets also gives equality of supports. Thus [F1] says that $\{\varphi_s\}$ is a partition of unity. [step 2.1, step 3.1, F1] ∎

## Statement

Assume the Axiom of Choice. If $X$ is paracompact and Hausdorff and
$\mathcal U$ is an open cover, there are a set $S$, a map $s\mapsto U_s$ from
$S$ into $\mathcal U$, and locally finite open covers $\{V_s\}_{s\in S}$ and
$\{W_s\}_{s\in S}$ with
$$\overline{V_s}\subseteq W_s\subseteq\overline{W_s}\subseteq U_s\quad(s\in S).$$

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The Axiom of Choice, a paracompact Hausdorff space $X$, and an open cover $\mathcal U$.

[A1] Every family of nonempty sets has a choice function ([[def-axiom-of-choice]]).

[L1] The space is regular ([[lem-paracompact-hausdorff-is-regular]]).

[L3] In a regular space, $x\in O$ open gives an open $R$ with $x\in R\subseteq\overline R\subseteq O$ ([[lem-regularity-via-closed-neighbourhoods]], implication (a)$\Rightarrow$(b)).

[F1] Every open cover has a locally finite open refinement ([[def-paracompact-space]]).

[L2] Locally finite unions commute with closure ([[lem-locally-finite-unions-and-closures]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 We first prove a one-shrink construction for any open cover $\mathcal C$. Let $\mathcal R$ be the family of all open $R$ for which $\overline R\subseteq C$ for some $C\in\mathcal C$. By [L1] and [L3], $\mathcal R$ covers $X$. Take a locally finite open refining cover $\mathcal A$ of $\mathcal R$ by [F1], discard its empty members, and use [A1] to assign to each $A\in\mathcal A$ sets $R(A)\in\mathcal R$ and $C(A)\in\mathcal C$ with $$A\subseteq R(A)\subseteq\overline{R(A)}\subseteq C(A).$$ Then $\overline A\subseteq\overline{R(A)}\subseteq C(A)$. [A1, L1, L3, F1, construct]

2.1 Apply step 1.1 to $\mathcal U$. This gives a locally finite open cover $\{W_s\}_{s\in S}$ and assigned $U_s\in\mathcal U$ such that $\overline{W_s}\subseteq U_s$. [step 1.1]

3.1 Apply step 1.1 again, now to the cover $\{W_s:s\in S\}$. Obtain a locally finite open cover $\{A_t\}_{t\in T}$ and a map $t\mapsto s(t)$ such that $\overline{A_t}\subseteq W_{s(t)}$. For $s\in S$ put $$V_s:=\bigcup\{A_t:s(t)=s\}.$$ The family $\{V_s\}_{s\in S}$ is an open cover. It is locally finite because any neighbourhood meeting only finitely many $A_t$ meets only the corresponding finitely many grouped unions $V_s$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, construct]

4.1 Each subfamily $\{A_t:s(t)=s\}$ is locally finite, so [L2] gives $$\overline{V_s} =\bigcup_{s(t)=s}\overline{A_t}\subseteq W_s.$$ Together with step 2.1 this yields $\overline{V_s}\subseteq W_s\subseteq\overline{W_s}\subseteq U_s$ for every $s$, with both displayed families locally finite open covers. [L2, step 2.1, step 3.1, discharge-construct] ∎

## Remarks

The Axiom of Choice is used to retain the assignments to cover members through the two locally finite refinements. This is a sufficient hypothesis for this construction; no claim is made that it is the exact choice strength.

## Statement

Every paracompact Hausdorff topological space is normal. No choice principle is
used.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A paracompact Hausdorff space $X$ and disjoint closed subsets $E,F\subseteq X$.

[L1] The space $X$ is regular ([[lem-paracompact-hausdorff-is-regular]]).

[L2] A locally finite family commutes with closure under union ([[lem-locally-finite-unions-and-closures]]).

[F1] Paracompactness supplies a locally finite open refining cover ([[def-paracompact-space]]).

[F2] Normality is separation of disjoint closed sets by disjoint open sets ([[def-normal-and-t4-spaces]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For each $x\in E$, regularity supplies an open $U$ containing $x$ with $\overline U\cap F=\varnothing$; therefore the family of all such $U$, together with $X\setminus E$, is an open cover $\mathcal U$ of $X$. [L1, construct]

2.1 Take a locally finite open cover $\mathcal W$ refining $\mathcal U$, and set $H:=\bigcup\{W\in\mathcal W:W\cap E\ne\varnothing\}$. [F1, step 1.1, choose, construct]

3.1 The open set $H$ contains $E$, because a member of $\mathcal W$ containing a point of $E$ cannot lie inside $X\setminus E$. [step 1.1, step 2.1]

3.2 Every member $W$ used in $H$ lies in one of the eligible $U$ and so has $\overline W\cap F=\varnothing$; hence $\overline H=\bigcup\overline W$ is disjoint from $F$ by [L2]. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L2]

4.1 The open sets $H$ and $X\setminus\overline H$ contain $E$ and $F$ respectively and are disjoint, so [F2] proves normality. [step 3.1, step 3.2, F2] ∎

## Statement

**Assume the Axiom of Dependent Choice** ([[def-dependent-choice]]). Let
$(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space.

1. If $X$ is normal ([[def-normal-and-t4-spaces]]) and $A, B \subseteq X$ are
   disjoint closed sets, there is a continuous $f : X \to [0,1]$
   ([[def-continuous-map-top]], [[def-interval]]) with
   $A \subseteq f^{-1}(\{0\})$ and $B \subseteq f^{-1}(\{1\})$.
2. Conversely, if every pair of disjoint closed subsets of $X$ admits a
   continuous function into $[0,1]$ separating them in the sense of clause 1,
   then $X$ is normal. **This direction uses no choice principle.**

**Where the choice principle of clause 1 is spent, and why not less.** The
construction below builds, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, an assignment of an
open set to every dyadic rational of level $n$, extending the level-$(n-1)$
assignment; at each single level the finitely many new open sets are chosen at
once by [[lem-finite-choice]], a theorem of ZF, but stringing together
infinitely many such levels, each depending on the one before, is exactly the
situation dependent choice is for. The published
[[rem-urysohn-lemma-not-a-zf-theorem]] records, with its sources, that
$\mathrm{ZF}$ and even $\mathrm{ZF}$ together with the Axiom of Countable
Choice do not suffice, and that dependent choice does; nothing here claims
dependent choice is *necessary* for clause 1, only that the construction given
is carried out in $\mathrm{ZF} + \mathrm{DC}$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A topological space $(X,\mathcal{T})$ and dependent choice.

[A1] $\mathrm{DC}$: for every nonempty set $P$, every relation $R \subseteq P \times P$ entire on $P$ (every $p \in P$ has some $q \in P$ with $p \mathbin{R} q$), and every $a \in P$, there is a sequence $(p_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ with $p_0 = a$ and $p_k \mathbin{R} p_{k+1}$ for every $k$ ([[def-dependent-choice]]).

[L1] Shrinking: if $X$ is normal, $C \subseteq X$ is closed and $O \subseteq X$ is open with $C \subseteq O$, then there is open $W$ with $C \subseteq W \subseteq \overline{W} \subseteq O$ ([[lem-normality-via-shrinking]]).

[L2] Finite choice: a function $F$ with domain a natural number $n$, all of whose values are nonempty sets, admits a choice function for the family $F[n]$ of its values ([[lem-finite-choice]], [[def-choice-function]]), a theorem of ZF.

[L3] The dyadic rationals $D = \bigcup_{n} D_n$ of $[0,1]$ are an increasing union of finite levels; for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $D_{n+1} = D_n \cup \{\, t_j : 0 \le j < 2^n \,\}$, where $t_j$ is strictly between the $D_n$-consecutive pair $r_j := j/2^n$ and $s_j := (j+1)/2^n$, the $2^n$ points $t_j$ are pairwise distinct and disjoint from $D_n$, and every two elements of $D$ lie together in some common $D_n$ ([[def-the-dyadic-rationals-of-the-unit-interval]]).

[L4] Chaining: if $V_0, \dots, V_k$ ($k \ge 0$) are subsets of $X$ with $\overline{V_i} \subseteq V_{i+1}$ for every $i < k$, then $\overline{V_0} \subseteq V_k$, since $V_i \subseteq \overline{V_i} \subseteq V_{i+1}$ for each $i$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]) makes $\overline{V_0} \subseteq V_1 \subseteq V_2 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq V_k$ a chain of inclusions.

[L5] The generic construction: if $(U_r)_{r \in D}$ is a family of open subsets of $X$ with $\overline{U_r} \subseteq U_s$ whenever $r<s$ in $D$ and $U_1 = X$, then $g(x) := \inf(\{r \in D : x \in U_r\} \cup \{1\})$ is a continuous map $X \to [0,1]$ ([[lem-a-dyadic-scale-of-open-sets-defines-a-continuous-function]]).

[L6] The order rays $(-\infty,\tfrac12)$ and $(\tfrac12,\infty)$ are open in the usual topology of $\mathbb R$ ([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]], clause 3), so their traces $[0,\tfrac12)$ and $(\tfrac12,1]$ are open in the subspace topology of $[0,1]$ ([[def-subspace-topology-top]], [[def-interval]]). They are disjoint and contain $0$ and $1$, respectively.

[L7] Preimages of open sets under a continuous map are open ([[thm-continuity-characterisations-top]], clause (b), [[def-continuous-map-top]]).

[L8] $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ for every $A \subseteq X$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 Assume $X$ is normal and $A, B \subseteq X$ are disjoint closed sets (the hypothesis of clause 1). [assume-hyp]

1.2 Assume instead that every pair of disjoint closed subsets of $X$ admits a continuous function into $[0,1]$ separating them as in clause 1 (the hypothesis of clause 2). [assume-hyp]

2.1 Under step 1.1: $A \subseteq X \setminus B$, since $A \cap B = \varnothing$, and $X \setminus B$ is open since $B$ is closed; by [L1] applied to the closed set $A$ and the open set $X \setminus B$, fix open $\Phi_0(0)$ with $A \subseteq \Phi_0(0) \subseteq \overline{\Phi_0(0)} \subseteq X \setminus B$, and put $\Phi_0(1) := X \setminus B$, defining $\Phi_0 : D_0 \to \mathcal{T}$ on $D_0 = \{0,1\}$. [step 1.1, L1, choose, construct]

2.2 Under step 1.2: let $C, E \subseteq X$ be disjoint closed sets; fix a continuous $h : X \to [0,1]$ with $C \subseteq h^{-1}(\{0\})$ and $E \subseteq h^{-1}(\{1\})$. [step 1.2, choose]

3.1 Under step 1.1: $A \subseteq \Phi_0(0)$; $\overline{\Phi_0(0)} \subseteq \Phi_0(1)$; and $\Phi_0(1) = X \setminus B$. [step 2.1]

3.2 Under step 1.2, continuing: by [L6], $[0,\tfrac12)$ and $(\tfrac12,1]$ are open in $[0,1]$, disjoint, with $0 \in [0,\tfrac12)$ and $1 \in (\tfrac12,1]$; put $O_1 := h^{-1}(\,[0,\tfrac12)\,)$ and $O_2 := h^{-1}(\,(\tfrac12,1]\,)$, open in $X$ by [L7]. [step 2.2, L6, L7]

4.1 Under step 1.1: for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, call $\Phi : D_n \to \mathcal{T}$ **admissible at level $n$** when (i) $\overline{\Phi(r)} \subseteq \Phi(s)$ for every $r < s$ in $D_n$; (ii) $A \subseteq \Phi(0)$; (iii) $\Phi(1) = X \setminus B$. Put $P := \{\, (n,\Phi) : n \in \mathbb{N},\ \Phi \text{ admissible at level } n \,\}$, and for $(n,\Phi), (n',\Phi') \in P$ say $(n,\Phi) \mathbin{R} (n',\Phi')$ when $n' = n+1$ and $\Phi'|_{D_n} = \Phi$. By step 3.1, $(0,\Phi_0) \in P$. [step 3.1, construct]

4.2 Under step 1.2: $C \subseteq O_1$, since $h \equiv 0 \in [0,\tfrac12)$ on $C$; $E \subseteq O_2$, since $h \equiv 1 \in (\tfrac12,1]$ on $E$; and $O_1 \cap O_2 = h^{-1}\big(\,[0,\tfrac12) \cap (\tfrac12,1]\,\big) = h^{-1}(\varnothing) = \varnothing$. [step 2.2, step 3.2, L6]

5.1 Under step 1.1: let $(n,\Phi) \in P$. For each $j$ with $0 \le j < 2^n$, with $r_j, s_j, t_j$ as in [L3]: since $r_j < s_j$ in $D_n$, admissibility (i) gives $\overline{\Phi(r_j)} \subseteq \Phi(s_j)$, so by [L1] the set of open $W$ with $\overline{\Phi(r_j)} \subseteq W \subseteq \overline{W} \subseteq \Phi(s_j)$ is nonempty. [step 4.1, L1, L3]

5.2 Under step 1.2: since $C, E$ were an arbitrary disjoint closed pair, step 4.2 exhibits disjoint open supersets for every such pair, so $X$ is normal by [[def-normal-and-t4-spaces]]; this is clause 2, and no step of it used [A1]. [step 4.2]

6.1 Under step 1.1, continuing under step 5.1: by [L2] applied to the function assigning, to each $j < 2^n$, the nonempty set of open $W$ with $\overline{\Phi(r_j)} \subseteq W \subseteq \overline{W} \subseteq \Phi(s_j)$, fix a simultaneous choice, giving open $W_j$ with $\overline{\Phi(r_j)} \subseteq W_j \subseteq \overline{W_j} \subseteq \Phi(s_j)$ for every $0 \le j < 2^n$. [step 5.1, L2, choose]

7.1 Under step 1.1: define $\Phi' : D_{n+1} \to \mathcal{T}$ by $\Phi'|_{D_n} := \Phi$ and $\Phi'(t_j) := W_j$ for $0 \le j < 2^n$; this is well defined since $D_{n+1} = D_n \cup \{t_j : 0 \le j < 2^n\}$ with the $t_j$ pairwise distinct and disjoint from $D_n$ by [L3]. Then $(n,\Phi) \mathbin{R} (n+1,\Phi')$. [step 6.1, L3, construct]

8.1 Under step 1.1, with $\Phi, \Phi'$ as in step 7.1: for the $D_{n+1}$-consecutive pair $(r_j, t_j)$: $\overline{\Phi'(r_j)} = \overline{\Phi(r_j)} \subseteq W_j = \Phi'(t_j)$ by step 6.1; for the pair $(t_j, s_j)$: $\overline{\Phi'(t_j)} = \overline{W_j} \subseteq \Phi(s_j) = \Phi'(s_j)$ by step 6.1. [step 7.1, step 6.1]

9.1 Under step 1.1: for $x < y$ in $D_{n+1}$, the finitely many elements of $D_{n+1} \cap [x,y]$, listed increasingly as $x = u_0 < u_1 < \cdots < u_k = y$, are $D_{n+1}$-consecutive at each step $u_i < u_{i+1}$, and each such pair is one of the pairs of step 8.1 (every $D_{n+1}$-consecutive pair has at least one member among the new points $t_j$, since a new point was inserted into every $D_n$-consecutive gap); so $\overline{\Phi'(u_i)} \subseteq \Phi'(u_{i+1})$ at each step, and [L4] gives $\overline{\Phi'(x)} = \overline{\Phi'(u_0)} \subseteq \Phi'(u_k) = \Phi'(y)$. [step 8.1, L3, L4]

10.1 Under step 1.1: $A \subseteq \Phi'(0) = \Phi(0)$, since $0 \in D_n$ is unaffected by the extension; $\Phi'(1) = \Phi(1) = X \setminus B$, since $1 \in D_n$ is likewise unaffected; with step 9.1 this is admissibility of $\Phi'$ at level $n+1$, so $(n+1,\Phi') \in P$. [step 7.1, step 9.1, L3]

11.1 Under step 1.1: by steps 5.1, 6.1, 7.1 and 10.1, every $(n,\Phi) \in P$ has some $(n+1,\Phi') \in P$ with $(n,\Phi) \mathbin{R} (n+1,\Phi')$; so $R$ is entire on $P$. [step 7.1, step 10.1]

12.1 Under step 1.1: $P$ is nonempty by step 4.1 and $R$ is entire on $P$ by step 11.1; by [A1] applied with $a := (0,\Phi_0)$, there is a sequence $\big((m_k,\Psi_k)\big)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ with $(m_0,\Psi_0) = (0,\Phi_0)$ and $(m_k,\Psi_k) \mathbin{R} (m_{k+1},\Psi_{k+1})$ for every $k$. [step 4.1, step 11.1, A1, construct]

13.1 Under step 1.1: since $(n,\Phi) \mathbin{R} (n',\Phi')$ forces $n' = n+1$, and $m_0 = 0$, induction on $k$ gives $m_k = k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$; so each $\Psi_k : D_k \to \mathcal{T}$ is admissible at level $k$, and $\Psi_{k+1}|_{D_k} = \Psi_k$ for every $k$. [step 12.1]

14.1 Under step 1.1: for $r \in D$, fix $n$ with $r \in D_n$ [L3] and define $V_r := \Psi_n(r)$; by step 13.1, for $n \le n'$ with $r \in D_n$, $\Psi_{n'}(r) = \Psi_n(r)$ (chaining $\Psi_{n'}|_{D_n} = \Psi_n$ through the intermediate levels), so $V_r$ does not depend on the level $n$ chosen. [step 13.1, L3, construct]

15.1 Under step 1.1: for $r < s$ in $D$, fix $n$ with $r, s \in D_n$ [L3]; then $\overline{V_r} = \overline{\Psi_n(r)} \subseteq \Psi_n(s) = V_s$ by admissibility (i) of $\Psi_n$. Also $A \subseteq V_0$ and $V_1 = X \setminus B$, by admissibility (ii) and (iii) of $\Psi_n$ for any $n$. [step 14.1, step 13.1, L3]

16.1 Under step 1.1: define $U_r := V_r$ for $r \in D$ with $r < 1$, and $U_1 := X$. For $r < s$ in $D$: if $s < 1$, $\overline{U_r} = \overline{V_r} \subseteq V_s = U_s$ by step 15.1; if $s = 1$, $\overline{U_r} = \overline{V_r} \subseteq V_1 = X \setminus B \subseteq X = U_1$ by step 15.1. So $\overline{U_r} \subseteq U_s$ whenever $r < s$ in $D$, and $U_1 = X$. [step 15.1, construct]

17.1 Under step 1.1: by [L5] applied to $(U_r)_{r \in D}$ of step 16.1, $f(x) := \inf(\{r \in D : x \in U_r\} \cup \{1\})$ is a continuous map $X \to [0,1]$. [step 16.1, L5]

17.2 Under step 1.1: for $b \in B$ and $r \in D$ with $r < 1$: fix $n$ with $r \in D_n$ [L3]; since $1 \in D_n$ also, admissibility (i) of $\Psi_n$ applied to $r < 1$ gives $\overline{\Psi_n(r)} \subseteq \Psi_n(1) = X \setminus B$, that is $\overline{V_r} \subseteq X \setminus B$; since $V_r \subseteq \overline{V_r}$ by [L8] and $U_r = V_r$ by step 16.1, $U_r \cap B = \varnothing$, so $b \notin U_r$. [step 14.1, step 13.1, step 16.1, L3, L8]

18.1 Under step 1.1: for $a \in A$: $a \in V_0$ by step 15.1, and $U_0 = V_0$ by step 16.1 (as $0 < 1$), so $a \in U_0$ and $0 \in \{r \in D : a \in U_r\}$; hence $f(a) \le 0$, and $f(a) \ge 0$ since $f$ maps into $[0,1]$ by step 17.1, so $f(a) = 0$. [step 17.1, step 16.1, step 15.1]

18.2 Under step 1.1: for $b \in B$: by step 17.2, $b \notin U_r$ for every $r \in D$ with $r < 1$, and $b \in U_1 = X$ by step 16.1; so $\{r \in D : b \in U_r\} \cup \{1\} = \{1\}$, giving $f(b) = \inf\{1\} = 1$. [step 17.2, step 16.1]

19.1 Steps 17.1, 18.1 and 18.2 show that, under the hypothesis of step 1.1, $f$ is a continuous map $X \to [0,1]$ with $A \subseteq f^{-1}(\{0\})$ and $B \subseteq f^{-1}(\{1\})$, which is clause 1. [step 17.1, step 18.1, step 18.2]

20.1 Steps 19.1 and 5.2 establish clauses 1 and 2 respectively. [step 19.1, step 5.2, discharge-construct] ∎

## Remarks

- **The lemma is stated for a normal space, not a $T_4$ space.** $T_1$ is used nowhere above; it is needed only to turn a *point* into a closed set, which is the extra step the next corollary spends. The published [[rem-urysohn-lemma-not-a-zf-theorem]] states the classical $T_4$ form; the form proved here is the more general one, and the two are not in tension — the $T_4$ form follows by adding the $T_1$ hypothesis, which is not used in this proof at all.

- **Only clause 1 costs a choice principle**, and it is spent at exactly one place: the single application of dependent choice in step 12.1, which strings together the countably many admissible levels built one finite step at a time in steps 5.1–10.1. Every other existential instantiation above (steps 2.1, 2.2 and 6.1) draws from a single nonempty set or, in step 6.1, from a finite family of them via [[lem-finite-choice]], and neither costs anything beyond ZF.

- **Why the construction tracks $X \setminus B$ rather than $X$ at $r=1$.** Recording $\Phi_n(1) := X \setminus B$ throughout the recursion, rather than $X$, is what makes admissibility clause (i) alone carry the whole $B$-avoidance property: since $1 \in D_n$ for every $n$, clause (i) applied to any $r<1$ already gives $\overline{\Phi_n(r)} \subseteq \Phi_n(1) = X \setminus B$, with no separate bookkeeping. Only at the very end, in step 16.1, is the top value widened from $X \setminus B$ to $X$, which is exactly what [[lem-a-dyadic-scale-of-open-sets-defines-a-continuous-function]] requires.
