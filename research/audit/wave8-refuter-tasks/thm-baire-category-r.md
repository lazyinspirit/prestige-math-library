## Statement

Let $(U_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, each
open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) and dense ([[def-limit-point-r]]). Then

$$\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} U_n \quad \text{is dense in } \mathbb{R}.$$

Consequently, if $(A_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence of nowhere dense
subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]]), then
$\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n \ne \mathbb{R}$: no meager subset of
$\mathbb{R}$ exhausts $\mathbb{R}$, so $\mathbb{R}$ is of the second category in
itself.

**The selection is canonical, and the proof spends no choice principle.** The
textbook argument picks a nested interval at every stage in terms of the one
before it, which is the axiom of dependent choice ([[def-dependent-choice]]). The construction below
instead fixes one enumeration $e$ of the rationals ([[thm-rationals-countable]],
[[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) and, at every stage, takes the interval whose two
rational endpoints have **least index** among those meeting the requirements.
The requirements are met by some rational-endpoint interval, which is what the
refinement claim of the proof establishes, and the least such index is
determined by [[thm-well-ordering-principle]]; so the whole recursion is a
single application of [[thm-recursion]] to one total map. This is the device of
[[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]], transplanted from perfect sets to dense open
sets. What it does **not** settle is the strength of the theorem for general
complete metric spaces, which is recorded separately in
[[rem-baire-in-r-is-choice-free]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(U_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of dense open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$. Write $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the image of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ under $q \mapsto \hat q$. A pair $(p,q) \in \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \times \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is called **good** when $p < q$, and $G$ denotes the set of good pairs.

[A1] Each $U_n$ is open and dense in $\mathbb{R}$.

[L1] $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is dense when $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$, and $\overline{A}$ is exactly the set of points every neighbourhood of which meets $A$; so $A$ is dense if and only if $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and every real $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L2] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; $N_\varepsilon(x) = (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon)$; every open interval $(p,q)$ is an open set, and $[p,q]$ is a closed bounded interval, nonempty when $p \le q$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L3] The intersection of two open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ is open, and the complement of a closed set is open ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L4] $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-rationals-countable]], [[def-equinumerous]]); $q \mapsto \hat q$ is injective with image $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, and strictly between any two reals lies an element of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]); a composition of bijections is a bijection ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L5] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L6] Recursion: for a set $Y$, an element $y_0 \in Y$ and a function $T : Y \to Y$ there is $h : \mathbb{N} \to Y$ with $h(0) = y_0$ and $h(\sigma(k)) = T(h(k))$ ([[thm-recursion]]).

[L7] Nested interval property: for nonempty closed bounded intervals $I_k = [a_k,b_k]$ with $I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k$, the intersection $\bigcap_k I_k$ is nonempty ([[thm-nested-interval-property]]).

[L8] $A$ is nowhere dense exactly when $\mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A}$ is dense; $\overline{A}$ is a closed set containing $A$ ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]]).

[L9] An at most countable family may always be presented as a sequence indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ ([[def-countable]], [[def-nowhere-dense-meager]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 Fix $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ and a real $\varepsilon_0 > 0$; by [L1] it suffices to produce a point of $\bigcap_n U_n$ lying in $N_{\varepsilon_0}(x_0)$, since $x_0$ and $\varepsilon_0$ are then arbitrary. [given, L1, suffices: one point in each neighbourhood]

1.2 By [L4] fix a bijection $\beta : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$ and put $e := \iota \circ \beta$, where $\iota(q) = \hat q$, so that $e$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N}$ onto $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$. [L4, choose]

1.3 Recall the terminology of the Given: a pair $(p,q)$ of elements of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is good when $p < q$, and $G$ is the set of good pairs. [given, construct]

2.1 **Refinement claim.** For every good $(p,q)$ and every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there is a good $(p',q')$ with $[p',q'] \subseteq (p,q) \cap U_n$. To see it, note first that $(p,q)$ is nonempty, since [L4] supplies an element of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ strictly between $p$ and $q$, and that $(p,q)$ is open by [L2]; fix $y_1 \in (p,q)$ and, by [L2], a real $\rho_1 > 0$ with $N_{\rho_1}(y_1) \subseteq (p,q)$. Since $U_n$ is dense, [A1] and [L1] give $y \in N_{\rho_1}(y_1) \cap U_n$, so $y \in (p,q) \cap U_n$, and that set is open by [A1], [L2] and [L3], so there is a real $\rho > 0$ with $N_\rho(y) \subseteq (p,q) \cap U_n$. By [L4] fix $p', q' \in \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ with $y - \rho < p' < y < q' < y + \rho$. Then $p' < q'$, so $(p',q')$ is good, and every $t \in [p',q']$ satisfies $y - \rho < p' \le t \le q' < y + \rho$, whence $|t - y| < \rho$ and $t \in N_\rho(y)$; thus $[p',q'] \subseteq N_\rho(y) \subseteq (p,q) \cap U_n$. [step 1.3, A1, L1, L2, L3, L4, choose]

3.1 **Successor rule.** For $(k, (p,q)) \in \mathbb{N} \times G$ let $m$ be the least natural for which some natural $j$ makes $(e(m), e(j))$ good with $[e(m), e(j)] \subseteq (p,q) \cap U_k$, and let $j$ be the least natural with that property for that $m$; put $T(k,(p,q)) := (\sigma(k), (e(m), e(j)))$. The set of eligible $m$ is nonempty by step 2.1 applied with $n = k$, since $e$ is onto $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ by step 1.2, so both minima exist by [L5] and $T : \mathbb{N} \times G \to \mathbb{N} \times G$ is a total function defined without any selection. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L4, L5, construct]

4.1 **The recursion.** By [L4] fix $p_0, q_0 \in \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ with $x_0 - \varepsilon_0 < p_0 < x_0 < q_0 < x_0 + \varepsilon_0$; then $(p_0,q_0)$ is good and, as in step 2.1, $[p_0,q_0] \subseteq N_{\varepsilon_0}(x_0)$ by [L2]. Apply [L6] with $Y = \mathbb{N} \times G$, seed $(0,(p_0,q_0))$ and map $T$ to get $h : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times G$ with $h(0) = (0,(p_0,q_0))$ and $h(\sigma(k)) = T(h(k))$; an induction on $k$ shows that the first coordinate of $h(k)$ is $k$, so write $h(k) = (k,(p_k,q_k))$, every $(p_k,q_k)$ being good. [step 1.1, step 1.3, step 3.1, L2, L4, L6, construct]

5.1 Write $I_k := [p_k, q_k]$, a nonempty closed bounded interval by [L2]. The rule of step 3.1 gives, for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, that $I_{k+1} \subseteq (p_k,q_k) \cap U_k \subseteq I_k$; in particular the family $(I_k)$ is nested and $I_{k+1} \subseteq U_k$. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L2]

6.1 By [L7] applied to the nested family $(I_k)$ of nonempty closed bounded intervals, $\bigcap_{k} I_k \ne \varnothing$; fix $x$ in it. [step 5.1, L7, choose]

7.1 For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ one has $x \in I_{n+1} \subseteq U_n$ by steps 5.1 and 6.1, so $x \in \bigcap_n U_n$; and $x \in I_0 \subseteq N_{\varepsilon_0}(x_0)$ by steps 4.1 and 6.1. So $N_{\varepsilon_0}(x_0)$ meets $\bigcap_n U_n$. [step 4.1, step 5.1, step 6.1]

8.1 Since $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ and the real $\varepsilon_0 > 0$ were arbitrary, every neighbourhood of every point of $\mathbb{R}$ meets $\bigcap_n U_n$, so that set is dense by [L1]. [step 1.1, step 7.1, L1]

9.1 For the consequence, let $(A_n)$ be a sequence of nowhere dense sets and put $U_n := \mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A_n}$, which is open by [L3] and [L8] and dense by [L8]; by step 8.1 the set $\bigcap_n U_n$ is dense, hence nonempty, and any $x$ in it lies outside every $\overline{A_n}$ and so outside every $A_n$, giving $x \notin \bigcup_n A_n$ and therefore $\bigcup_n A_n \ne \mathbb{R}$. By [L9] the same conclusion covers a union of an at most countable family of nowhere dense sets, so no meager set is all of $\mathbb{R}$. [step 8.1, L1, L3, L8, L9, discharge-construct] ∎

## Remarks

- **What "dense" is doing at each end.** Density of the $U_n$ is used exactly once, in the refinement claim, to find a point of $U_n$ inside a given open interval; openness is used exactly once, immediately after, to fit a whole closed interval with rational endpoints around that point. Neither hypothesis can be dropped. Without openness the conclusion fails: the family consisting of $\mathbb{Q}$ together with all the sets $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{q\}$ for $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ is an at most countable family of dense sets, all but the first of them open, and its intersection is empty. Without density it fails too, for the constant sequence $U_n := (0,1)$ has intersection $(0,1)$, which is not dense in $\mathbb{R}$.

- **Only nonemptiness of the nested intersection is used.** The construction does not force the interval lengths to $0$ and does not need to: claim 1 of [[thm-nested-interval-property]] already produces a point, and one point is all the argument wants. That is why no Archimedean step appears anywhere above.

- **The consequence is the form used downstream.** Applying it to the sequence of singletons $\{x_n\}$ of a supposed enumeration of $\mathbb{R}$ reproves that $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable ([[ex-baire-reproves-r-uncountable]]); applying it to a supposed presentation of $\mathbb{Q}$ as a $G_\delta$ set is what shows that no such presentation exists ([[cor-q-is-meager-and-not-g-delta]]).

- **Category is not measure.** The intersection produced above is dense but may be very small in the sense of [[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]; indeed $\mathbb{R}$ decomposes as a meager set together with a set of measure zero ([[cex-meager-set-of-full-measure]]), so this theorem says nothing whatever about size in measure.

## Statement refuted

**Refuted claim:** meagreness and measure zero are comparable notions of
smallness, so that a set small in one sense is small, or at least not
co-small, in the other.

The witness is a decomposition $\mathbb{R} = (\mathbb{R} \setminus G) \cup G$ in
which $\mathbb{R} \setminus G$ is meager ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]]) and $G$
has measure zero ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]). So $\mathbb{R}$, which
by [[thm-baire-category-r]] is not meager, splits into two pieces each of which
is negligible, one in the sense of category and one in the sense of measure. In
particular $G$ is residual and null at the same time, and its complement is
meager and, being the complement of a null set, in no sense small in measure.

The set is
$$G := \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} U_n, \qquad U_n := \bigcup_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \big(e(k) - 2^{-k-n-2},\ e(k) + 2^{-k-n-2}\big),$$
where $e : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is a bijection onto the
rationals ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A bijection $e : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ onto the rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$, the sets $U_n$ and $G$ displayed above.

[A1] The refuted claim: a meager set and a set of measure zero cannot together exhaust $\mathbb{R}$, meagreness and nullity being comparable notions of smallness.

[L1] $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ and $q \mapsto \hat q$ is injective onto $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, so a bijection $e$ exists; $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-rationals-countable]], [[def-equinumerous]], [[def-countable]], [[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]], [[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L2] $(c,d)$ is an open interval of length $d - c$ and is an open set; an arbitrary union of open sets is open; the complement of an open set is closed ([[def-interval]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]).

[L3] A set is dense exactly when every $N_\varepsilon(x)$ meets it; a closed set is nowhere dense exactly when its interior is empty; a meager set is a union of a sequence of nowhere dense sets ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-nowhere-dense-meager]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]).

[L4] $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}2^{-k} = 2$, powers satisfy $2^{-k-n-1} = 2^{-n-1}2^{-k}$, finite sums scale, and $2^{-n} \to 0$ ([[thm-geometric-series]], [[def-series]], [[def-integer-power]], [[lem-power-laws]], [[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]], [[lem-geometric-sequence-null]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L5] Nullity: $A$ is null when for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a sequence of closed intervals covering $A$ with all partial total lengths at most $\varepsilon$; every at most countable set is null ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]], [[lem-countable-sets-are-null]]).

[L6] $\mathbb{R}$ is not a union of a sequence of nowhere dense sets ([[thm-baire-category-r]]).

[L7] $G$ is an intersection of a sequence of open sets, so it is $G_\delta$ ([[def-f-sigma-g-delta]]).

[L8] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 > 0$ and $2^{-k-n-2} > 0$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve an inequality ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Fix $e$ by [L1]. Each $U_n$ is an open set, being a union of open intervals by [L2], and each contains $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, since $e(k)$ lies in the $k$-th interval by [L8]. Hence each $U_n$ is dense by [L1] and [L3], a superset of a dense set being dense. [given, L1, L2, L3, L8, choose]

2.1 **$G$ is null.** Let the real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given and use [L4] to fix $n$ with $2^{-n} \le \varepsilon$. The closed intervals $I_k := [\,e(k) - 2^{-k-n-2},\ e(k) + 2^{-k-n-2}\,]$ cover $U_n$, hence cover $G \subseteq U_n$, and each has length $2^{-k-n-1} = 2^{-n-1}2^{-k}$ by [L2], [L4] and [L8]; so every partial total length is $\sum_{k<i}2^{-n-1}2^{-k} = 2^{-n-1}\sum_{k<i}2^{-k} \le 2^{-n-1} \cdot 2 = 2^{-n} \le \varepsilon$ by [L4]. By [L5] the set $G$ has measure zero. [step 1.1, L4, L5, L8]

2.2 **$\mathbb{R} \setminus G$ is meager.** By De Morgan $\mathbb{R} \setminus G = \bigcup_n (\mathbb{R} \setminus U_n)$, and each $\mathbb{R} \setminus U_n$ is closed by [L2]. Its interior is empty: if $N_\delta(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus U_n$ for some real $\delta > 0$, then $N_\delta(x)$ would miss $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \subseteq U_n$, contradicting the density of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ given by [L1] and [L3]. So each $\mathbb{R} \setminus U_n$ is nowhere dense by [L3], and $\mathbb{R} \setminus G$ is meager. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L3]

3.1 So $\mathbb{R} = (\mathbb{R} \setminus G) \cup G$ with the first piece meager and the second null, which is the failure of [A1]. Moreover $G$ is residual, its complement being meager, and $G \ne \varnothing$: were $G$ empty, $\mathbb{R} = \mathbb{R} \setminus G$ would be meager, contradicting [L6]. Thus $G$ is a residual, $G_\delta$ set of measure zero by [L7], and $\mathbb{R} \setminus G$ is a meager set whose complement is null. [step 2.1, step 2.2, A1, L3, L6, L7] ∎

## Remarks

- **Both pieces are as small as their notion allows, and they are complementary.**
  $G$ is null and residual; $\mathbb{R} \setminus G$ is meager and its complement
  is null. So no implication holds between "meager" and "null" in either
  direction, and neither can be strengthened to a statement about the complement.
  This is the standard duality between measure and category, and $G$ is the
  standard witness for it.

- **$G$ contains all the irrationals that are well approximable by rationals.**
  Membership in $U_n$ says that some rational $e(k)$ lies within
  $2^{-k-n-2}$ of the point, so $G$ is a set of points approximable by rationals
  at every accuracy of that shape. Nothing on this page needs that reading; it is
  recorded because it is what makes the example natural rather than contrived.

- **Baire is used only once, and only for nonemptiness.** Steps 2.1 and 2.2 are
  independent of [[thm-baire-category-r]]; it enters in step 3.1 to rule out
  $G = \varnothing$, which would make the decomposition vacuous. That is also the
  precise sense in which the example needs the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The individual $U_n$ are open, dense and of small total cover length**, which
  is [[ex-q-covered-by-intervals-of-small-total-length]] with
  $\varepsilon = 2^{-n}$; the example is that construction iterated and
  intersected.

## Statement

Write $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the image of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$
under the canonical embedding $q \mapsto \hat q$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), the
set usually written $\mathbb{Q}$ once the identification is made, and put
$X := \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the irrationals. Then:

1. $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is an $F_\sigma$ set ([[def-f-sigma-g-delta]]) and is
   meager ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]]);
2. $X$ is a $G_\delta$ set and is residual;
3. $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is **not** a $G_\delta$ set, and $X$ is **not** an
   $F_\sigma$ set.

Claims 1 and 2 are bookkeeping. Claim 3 is the substance and is exactly where
[[thm-baire-category-r]] is spent: no argument from the algebra of open and
closed sets alone can reach it, since $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and $X$ are
interchanged by complementation while $F_\sigma$ and $G_\delta$ are, so any such
argument would prove the same thing about both sets and about neither.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The complete ordered field $\mathbb{R}$, the set $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ of rationals and its complement $X = \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$.

[L1] $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-rationals-countable]], [[def-equinumerous]]), $q \mapsto \hat q$ is injective with image $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and a composition of bijections is a bijection ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]); an at most countable family may be presented as a sequence indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ ([[def-countable]]).

[L2] $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]); a set is dense when its closure is $\mathbb{R}$, equivalently when every $N_\varepsilon(x)$ meets it ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]); the closure operator is monotone, so a superset of a dense set is dense ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]).

[L3] $U$ is open when every point of it has a neighbourhood inside it, and $F$ is closed when $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open; $N_\varepsilon(x) = (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon)$ and $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L4] A closed set is nowhere dense exactly when its interior is empty; a meager set is a union of a sequence of nowhere dense sets; residual means the complement is meager ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]]).

[L5] $A$ is $F_\sigma$ when it is the union of a sequence of closed sets and $G_\delta$ when it is the intersection of a sequence of open sets; $A$ is $F_\sigma$ if and only if $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ is $G_\delta$ ([[def-f-sigma-g-delta]]).

[L6] A countable intersection of dense open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ is dense ([[thm-baire-category-r]]).

[L7] There is a bijection $J : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-n-cross-n-countable]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 For $c \in \mathbb{R}$ the singleton $\{c\}$ is closed and nowhere dense: its complement is open, since $x \ne c$ gives $N_{|x-c|}(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus \{c\}$ by [L3]; and its interior is empty, since for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the point $c + \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$ lies in $N_\varepsilon(c)$ and differs from $c$, so no neighbourhood is contained in $\{c\}$, whence $\{c\}$ is a closed set with empty interior and [L4] applies. [L3, L4]

1.2 By [L1] fix a bijection $\beta : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$ and put $e := \iota \circ \beta$ with $\iota(q) = \hat q$, a bijection from $\mathbb{N}$ onto $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$. [L1, choose]

2.1 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \{e(n)\}$, since $e$ is onto $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$; the sets $\{e(n)\}$ are closed and nowhere dense by step 1.1, so $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is $F_\sigma$ by [L5] and meager by [L4]. This is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L4, L5]

3.1 Put $W_n := \mathbb{R} \setminus \{e(n)\}$, an open set by step 1.1 and [L3]. A real $x$ lies in $\bigcap_n W_n$ exactly when $x \ne e(n)$ for every $n$, that is, exactly when $x \notin \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, so $X = \bigcap_n W_n$ and $X$ is $G_\delta$ by [L5]; and $\mathbb{R} \setminus X = \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is meager by step 2.1, so $X$ is residual by [L4]. This is claim 2. Each $W_n$ is also dense, since every $N_\varepsilon(x)$ contains two distinct points and so meets $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{e(n)\}$, by [L2] and [L3]. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.1, L2, L3, L4, L5]

4.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is $G_\delta$, and by [L5] fix a sequence $(V_n)$ of open sets with $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} = \bigcap_n V_n$. Each $V_n$ contains $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, which is dense by [L2], so each $V_n$ is dense by [L2]; and each $W_n$ of step 3.1 is open and dense. [assume-contra, step 3.1, L2, L5, choose]

5.1 By [L7] fix a bijection $J : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ and define a sequence $(D_j)$ by $D_{J(m,n)} := V_n$ when $m = 0$ and $D_{J(m,n)} := W_n$ when $m \ne 0$; this is total because $J$ is a bijection, and every $D_j$ is open and dense by step 4.1. Moreover $\bigcap_j D_j = \big(\bigcap_n V_n\big) \cap \big(\bigcap_n W_n\big) = \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \cap X = \varnothing$, since every $V_n$ and every $W_n$ occurs among the $D_j$ and every $D_j$ is one of them. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L7]

6.1 By [L6] the set $\bigcap_j D_j$ is dense, hence nonempty by [L2] and [L3], contradicting step 5.1. The assumption of step 4.1 is therefore untenable: $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is not $G_\delta$; and $X$ is not $F_\sigma$, since $\mathbb{R} \setminus X = \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ would then be $G_\delta$ by [L5]. This is claim 3. [step 4.1, step 5.1, L2, L3, L5, L6, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the two halves of the argument part company.** Claim 1 is a listing argument and would work equally in $\mathbb{Q}$ or in any countable space; claim 3 uses the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ through [[thm-nested-interval-property]], inside [[thm-baire-category-r]]. Indeed $\mathbb{Q}$ is a $G_\delta$ subset of itself, being the whole space, so no argument that ignores the ambient completeness can possibly give claim 3.

- **The irrationals are also uncountable** ([[cor-irrationals-uncountable]]), by a different and much cheaper argument that needs only the countability of $\mathbb{Q}$ and the uncountability of $\mathbb{R}$. Uncountability and being residual are independent properties: $\mathbb{Q}$ is meager and countable, the Cantor set is meager and uncountable ([[thm-cantor-set-properties]]), and $X$ is residual and uncountable.

- **The named witness for claim 3** is [[cex-irrationals-are-not-f-sigma]], and the false statement it refutes is [[fs-q-is-g-delta]]; the refutation is carried out here.

- **Meagre and measure zero are not the same smallness.** $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is both, but the two notions diverge as soon as one leaves the countable case: [[cex-meager-set-of-full-measure]] writes $\mathbb{R}$ as a meager set together with a set of measure zero, and the set of measure zero there is residual. So being residual, which is what claim 2 gives for $X$, carries no information at all about size in measure.

## Definition

Recall that a natural number is a von Neumann natural
([[def-natural-numbers]]): $0 = \varnothing$ and $\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$, so
that

$$n = \{\, m \in \mathbb{N} : m < n \,\} = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$$

is itself the set of its predecessors. Here $<$ is the order of
[[def-nat-order]], which is defined additively, so the displayed identity is a
theorem and not a convention: it is [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]], proved
immediately above. Let $A$ be a set, and let $\approx$ be equinumerosity
([[def-equinumerous]]).

- $A$ is **finite** if $A \approx n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
- $A$ is **countably infinite** if $A \approx \mathbb{N}$.
- $A$ is **at most countable** if it is finite or countably infinite.
- $A$ is **uncountable** if it is not at most countable.

## Remarks

- **Convention: in this library "countable" alone always means "at most
  countable"**, so a finite set is countable. This is the convention of Halmos
  and of Tao, and it is the one that makes the theorems on this page read
  cleanly: subsets, products and unions of countable sets are countable, with no
  finite/infinite case split in the statement. The competing convention, used by
  Rudin among others, reserves "countable" for "countably infinite" and says
  "at most countable" for the disjunction. Under that convention every statement
  below still holds after replacing "countable" with "at most countable", but
  several would become false as literally written. Where the distinction
  matters, the long forms "countably infinite" and "at most countable" are used
  in full, and "uncountable" always means "not at most countable", on which the
  two conventions agree.

- **The three classes are exhaustive by construction**: every set is finite,
  countably infinite, or uncountable, since "uncountable" is defined as the
  negation of the disjunction. That they are also mutually exclusive, that is,
  that no set is both finite and countably infinite, is a genuine theorem
  amounting to $\mathbb{N} \not\approx n$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and it is
  proved immediately above as claim 4 of [[lem-pigeonhole]]. So a countably
  infinite set is never finite, and "$A$ is infinite", meaning not finite, is
  implied by $A \approx \mathbb{N}$. The same lemma pins down finiteness itself:
  by its claim 3 a finite set is equinumerous with exactly one natural number, so
  the number of elements of a finite set is well defined, and by its claim 5 no
  finite set is equinumerous with a proper subset of itself.

- **What the exclusivity is and is not used for below.** Nothing on this page
  needs it in order to run: the infinitude of $\mathbb{Q}$, for instance, is
  obtained by exhibiting a bijection $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ directly
  ([[thm-rationals-countable]]) rather than by ruling out finiteness. It is used
  where the two notions of infinity are compared
  ([[fs-infinite-has-countable-subset-in-zf]]) and where the continuum hypothesis
  is instantiated at $\mathbb{N}$ ([[rem-continuum-hypothesis]]), both of which
  need $\mathbb{N}$ to be infinite as a fact rather than as a convention.

- **$0$ and the empty set.** $0 = \varnothing$, and $A \approx 0$ holds exactly
  when $A = \varnothing$, so the empty set is finite. This matters in the proofs
  below, where the empty case is always separated out: a surjection
  $\mathbb{N} \to A$ cannot exist when $A = \varnothing$, which is why
  [[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]] assumes $A$ nonempty.

- **Countability is a property of a set alone**, not of a set with structure. In
  particular $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable while carrying a dense order, and
  $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable; neither statement says anything on its own about
  the order or the arithmetic those sets carry.

## Definition

Let $X$ be a set and let $R \subseteq X \times X$ be a binary relation on $X$.
Call $R$ **entire on $X$** when

$$\text{for every } x \in X \text{ there is } y \in X \text{ with } x \mathbin{R} y .$$

The **Axiom of Dependent Choice**, written $\mathrm{DC}$, is the following
statement.

> For every nonempty set $X$, every relation $R$ entire on $X$, and every
> $a \in X$, there is a sequence $x : \mathbb{N} \to X$ ([[def-sequence]],
> [[def-natural-numbers]]) with
> $$x_0 = a \qquad \text{and} \qquad x_n \mathbin{R} x_{n+1} \ \text{ for every } n \in \mathbb{N}.$$

As everywhere in this library $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$, and the sequence is
indexed from $0$; the term $x_0$ is the prescribed starting point $a$ and every
later term is related to its predecessor.

**What DC adds to what came before.** [[def-choice-function]] and
[[def-axiom-of-choice]] select one element from each member of a family that is
fixed in advance, and [[def-countable-choice]] does the same for a family indexed
by $\mathbb{N}$. In both, the family is given before any selection is made. DC is
the principle needed when the $n$-th set to select from is not known until the
first $n$ selections have been made: here the admissible values of $x_{n+1}$ are
exactly the $R$-successors of $x_n$, so the family being chosen from is built
along the choosing. That is precisely the situation $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ does not
cover, and it is why a construction "pick $x_{n+1}$ depending on $x_n$, for every
$n$ at once" is not licensed by countable choice.

**The starting point may be dropped.** The formally weaker statement obtained by
deleting the clause $x_0 = a$ — for every nonempty $X$ and every entire $R$ there
is a sequence with $x_n \mathbin{R} x_{n+1}$ for all $n$ — is an immediate
consequence of the form above, since $X$ is nonempty and any of its elements may
be taken as $a$. The reverse derivation is standard and is not needed anywhere in
this library, so it is not carried out; every use below prescribes $x_0$.

**$R$ need not be an order and the terms need not be distinct.** What DC delivers
is a sequence, that is a function $\mathbb{N} \to X$, not a chain in the
order-theoretic sense ([[def-chain]]). The relation may be symmetric, and the
sequence may repeat a value or be constant; all that is asserted is
$x_n \mathbin{R} x_{n+1}$ at every index.

## Remarks

**Where DC sits among the choice principles.** It is a standard fact, proved in
the references and **not** in this library, that

$$\mathrm{AC} \;\Longrightarrow\; \mathrm{DC} \;\Longrightarrow\; \mathrm{AC}_\omega ,$$

and that neither implication reverses. The non-reversals are relative-consistency
results: what they establish is that ZF, if consistent, does not prove the
missing implications, never that those implications are false. This library
contains neither forcing nor permutation models and proves no independence
result, so all of that is quoted from the references and used nowhere.

**Nothing in this library proves DC, and nothing assumes it silently.** Like
[[def-axiom-of-choice]] and [[def-countable-choice]], DC is a statement that may
be assumed or not. Every theorem whose proof uses it says so in its own
statement, and the accounting for the compactness page is collected in
[[rem-compactness-choice-ledger-metric]].

**An upper bound, never a lower one.** When a later item records that its proof
uses DC, the claim made is that the argument given here is carried out in
$\mathrm{ZF} + \mathrm{DC}$. No item claims that DC is *necessary* for the
statement proved, because establishing necessity means separating the statement
from ZF, and that is an independence result of exactly the kind this library does
not prove.

## Definition

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]] for the
terminology).

- $A$ and $B$ are **equinumerous**, written $A \approx B$, if there exists a
  bijection $f : A \to B$.
- $A$ is **dominated by** $B$, written $A \preceq B$, if there exists an
  injection $f : A \to B$.
- $A \prec B$ abbreviates: $A \preceq B$ and not $A \approx B$.

## Remarks

- **$\approx$ behaves like an equivalence relation.** It is reflexive
  ($\mathrm{id}_A$ is a bijection), symmetric (the inverse of a bijection is a
  bijection) and transitive (a composition of bijections is a bijection). The
  careful statement is that these three properties hold for all sets, and that
  $\approx$ restricted to any *set* of sets is an equivalence relation on that
  set. It is not a relation on "the set of all sets", which does not exist; the
  reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity statements are schemas about arbitrary
  sets, which is all any argument below uses.

- **$\preceq$ is reflexive and transitive**, for the same reasons, and
  $A \approx B$ implies both $A \preceq B$ and $B \preceq A$. The converse, that
  $A \preceq B$ and $B \preceq A$ together give $A \approx B$, is a theorem and
  not a triviality: it is [[thm-schroder-bernstein]], and it is proved without
  any use of choice.

- **Subsets.** $A \subseteq B$ implies $A \preceq B$, since the inclusion map is
  injective. The reverse fails badly for infinite sets: the successor map
  $\sigma$ is a bijection $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, being
  injective and never zero ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]) and hitting every
  nonzero natural ([[lem-nat-nonzero-is-successor]]), so
  $\mathbb{N} \approx \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$ and a proper subset can be
  equinumerous with the whole.

- $\approx$ is the library's substitute for "has the same number of elements",
  stated without introducing cardinal numbers. Everything on this page is phrased
  with $\approx$, $\preceq$ and $\prec$ alone, so no theory of cardinals is
  presupposed.

## Definition

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets and let $f : A \to B$ be a function ([[def-function]]).

- $f$ is **injective** (one-to-one) if $f(x) = f(y)$ implies $x = y$, for all
  $x, y \in A$.
- $f$ is **surjective** (onto) if for every $b \in B$ there is some $x \in A$
  with $f(x) = b$; equivalently, the image $f[A] := \{ f(x) : x \in A \}$ equals
  $B$.
- $f$ is **bijective** if it is both injective and surjective.

For $S \subseteq A$ we write $f[S] = \{ f(x) : x \in S \}$ for the image of $S$,
and for $T \subseteq B$ we write $f^{-1}[T] = \{ x \in A : f(x) \in T \}$ for the
preimage of $T$; these are the image and preimage of a set under $f$ read as a
relation ([[def-image-and-preimage-under-a-relation]]).

## Remarks

- **Composition.** If $f : A \to B$ and $g : B \to C$ are both injective then so
  is $g \circ f$, since $g(f(x)) = g(f(y))$ forces $f(x) = f(y)$ and then
  $x = y$; if both are surjective then so is $g \circ f$, since any $c \in C$ is
  $g(b)$ for some $b \in B$ and that $b$ is $f(a)$ for some $a \in A$. Hence a
  composition of bijections is a bijection. These verifications, together with the
  two partial converses, are
  [[prop-composition-preserves-injectivity-surjectivity-and-bijectivity]].

- **Inverses.** $f : A \to B$ is bijective exactly when there is a function
  $f^{-1} : B \to A$ with $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ for all $x \in A$ and
  $f(f^{-1}(b)) = b$ for all $b \in B$; that two-sided inverse is unique, and it
  is itself a bijection. Injectivity alone gives a bijection from $A$ onto the
  image $f[A]$, and hence an inverse defined on $f[A]$ only. No choice principle
  is involved: the value $f^{-1}(b)$ is the *unique* $x$ with $f(x) = b$, so it
  is determined rather than selected. The full statement, with the uniqueness of the
  two-sided inverse, is
  [[thm-a-function-is-a-bijection-exactly-when-it-has-a-two-sided-inverse]]; the
  corresponding statement for an arbitrary surjection is not available at this point
  in the reading order, because a right inverse for every surjection is equivalent
  to the Axiom of Choice.

- **What this item does and does not do.** A function $A \to B$ is a set of ordered
  pairs, single valued and total on $A$ ([[def-function]]); ordered pairs, Cartesian
  products, images and preimages are fixed by [[def-ordered-pair]],
  [[def-cartesian-product]] and [[def-image-and-preimage-under-a-relation]]. This
  item only fixes the three adjectives and the notation used for them. Nothing here
  is proved.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with open and closed sets as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

- The **interior** of $A$ is the union of all open subsets of $A$:
  $$A^{\circ} \;:=\; \bigcup \{\, U \subseteq \mathbb{R} : U \text{ open and } U \subseteq A \,\}.$$
- The **closure** of $A$ is the intersection of all closed supersets of $A$:
  $$\overline{A} \;:=\; \bigcap \{\, F \subseteq \mathbb{R} : F \text{ closed and } A \subseteq F \,\}.$$
- The **boundary** of $A$ is $\partial A := \overline{A} \setminus A^{\circ}$.
- The **exterior** of $A$ is $\operatorname{ext} A := (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)^{\circ}$.

**Both operators are well defined and deliver what their names claim.** The
family whose union defines $A^{\circ}$ always contains $\varnothing$, and the
family whose intersection defines $\overline{A}$ always contains $\mathbb{R}$,
so the second family is nonempty and both expressions denote subsets of
$\mathbb{R}$ without appeal to any convention about empty unions or
intersections. Moreover:

- $A^{\circ}$ is **open**, being a union of open sets
  ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], claim 1), and $A^{\circ} \subseteq A$, since
  every set in the family is a subset of $A$. It is therefore the **largest**
  open subset of $A$: any open $U \subseteq A$ is a member of the family and so
  $U \subseteq A^{\circ}$.
- $\overline{A}$ is **closed**, being an intersection of a nonempty family of
  closed sets ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], claim 3), and $A \subseteq
  \overline{A}$, since every set in the family contains $A$. It is therefore the
  **smallest** closed superset of $A$: any closed $F \supseteq A$ is a member of
  the family and so $\overline{A} \subseteq F$.

**Pointwise description of the interior.** For $x \in \mathbb{R}$,

$$x \in A^{\circ} \iff \text{there is } \varepsilon > 0 \text{ with } N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A .$$

If $x \in A^{\circ}$ then, $A^{\circ}$ being open and containing $x$, there is
$\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A^{\circ} \subseteq A$.
Conversely if $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A$ then $N_\varepsilon(x)$ is an open
subset of $A$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) containing $x$, hence
$x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A^{\circ}$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

The corresponding pointwise description of the closure is not a definitional
matter and is proved separately, as [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

## Remarks

- **The four sets partition nothing by themselves, but three of them do.** For
  every $A$ the three sets $A^{\circ}$, $\partial A$ and $\operatorname{ext} A$
  are pairwise disjoint with union $\mathbb{R}$. This is not proved here and is
  not used on this page; what is used is only the definitions above and the
  characterisations of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

- **Interior and closure are dual.** Complementation exchanges the two families
  above, since $U$ is open exactly when $\mathbb{R} \setminus U$ is closed, so
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus A^{\circ} = \overline{\mathbb{R} \setminus A}$ and
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A} = (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)^{\circ} =
  \operatorname{ext} A$. The second identity is the reason the exterior is
  usually described as "the complement of the closure".

- **$A$ is open exactly when $A = A^{\circ}$, and closed exactly when
  $A = \overline{A}$.** For the first: $A^{\circ} \subseteq A$ always, and
  $A \subseteq A^{\circ}$ holds exactly when $A$ is one of the open subsets of
  $A$, that is, exactly when $A$ is open. The closure half is the same argument
  read the other way, and it is recorded as a claim of
  [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] because the rest of that theorem needs it.

- **Boundary points may or may not belong to the set.** $\partial (0,1) =
  \partial [0,1] = \{0,1\}$, and the two boundary points lie outside the first
  set and inside the second; the boundary sees only the way the set meets its
  complement, not which side the edge is assigned to.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]] and closure as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]].

- $x$ is an **adherent point** of $A$ when $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne
  \varnothing$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$.
- $x$ is a **limit point** (or *accumulation point*) of $A$ when
  $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every real
  $\varepsilon > 0$: every punctured neighbourhood of $x$ meets $A$.
- $x$ is an **isolated point** of $A$ when $x \in A$ and there is a real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$.
- The **derived set** of $A$ is
  $$A' \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \text{ is a limit point of } A \,\}.$$
- $A$ is **dense in $\mathbb{R}$** when $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$.

**A limit point is an adherent point**, since $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq
N_\varepsilon(x)$; and an element of $A$ is an adherent point of $A$, since
$x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). So the adherent
points of $A$ are exactly the points of $A \cup A'$, a statement proved as part
of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

**Limit point and isolated point are exact opposites inside $A$.** For
$x \in A$: $x$ is an isolated point of $A$ exactly when it is not a limit point
of $A$. Indeed $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$ says precisely that
$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, because $x$ itself always lies in
$N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ when $x \in A$; so the existence of an $\varepsilon$
witnessing isolation is the negation of the condition defining a limit point.
A point of $A$ is therefore either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$, and
never both.

**A limit point need not belong to the set, and a point of the set need not be a
limit point.** Both possibilities occur, and the two examples that matter later
are $0$, which is a limit point of $\{\, 1/k : k \ge 1 \,\}$ without belonging
to it, and $0$ again, which belongs to $\{0\} \cup [1,2]$ as an isolated point.

## Remarks

- **Terminology: *limit point* here is about a set, never about a sequence.**
  This library reserves *subsequential limit* for the sequential notion
  ([[def-subsequential-limit]]), and the two are genuinely different: the
  constant sequence $x_k = 0$ has $0$ as a subsequential limit, while its set of
  values $\{0\}$ has no limit point at all. The distinction is the one
  [[def-subsequential-limit]] records under "Terminology", and it is respected
  throughout this page.

- **Density is defined through the closure, not through intervals.** Saying
  $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$ is equivalent to saying that every nonempty open
  subset of $\mathbb{R}$ meets $A$, and also to saying that every neighbourhood
  of every real meets $A$; the equivalences follow from
  [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] and are used in that form in
  [[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]].

- **The derived set need not be comparable with the set.** It can be strictly
  larger, as for $\mathbb{Q}$: every punctured neighbourhood of any real
  contains a rational, since density supplies one strictly between $x$ and
  $x + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]), so the derived set of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is all of $\mathbb{R}$. It can be strictly smaller, as for
  $\{0\}$, whose derived set is empty; and it can be neither, as for
  $\{0\} \cup (1,2)$, whose derived set is $[1,2]$, a set containing points
  outside the original and omitting the point $0$ of it. A closed set satisfying
  $A \subseteq A'$ is called perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]).

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), intervals and their lengths are as in
[[def-interval]], and a *sequence* is a function on $\mathbb{N}$, which contains
$0$. Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

- $A$ has **measure zero**, equivalently $A$ is **null**, when for every real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ there are sequences $(a_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ and
  $(b_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of reals with $a_k \le b_k$ for every $k$, such
  that
  $$A \subseteq \bigcup_{k \in \mathbb{N}} [a_k, b_k] \qquad \text{and} \qquad \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (b_k - a_k) \text{ converges with sum } \le \varepsilon .$$
- $A$ has **content zero** when for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there are
  $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and reals $a_0 \le b_0, \dots, a_n \le b_n$ with
  $$A \subseteq \bigcup_{j \le n} [a_j, b_j] \qquad \text{and} \qquad \sum_{j=0}^{n} (b_j - a_j) \le \varepsilon .$$

The number $b_k - a_k \ge 0$ is the length of $[a_k,b_k]$ ([[def-interval]]), and
the sums are the series and the finite sums of [[def-series]] and
[[def-finite-sum]].

**Working form: only the partial sums have to be checked.** All the terms
$b_k - a_k$ are $\ge 0$, so by claim 2 of
[[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]] the series converges exactly when
its partial sums are bounded above, and its sum is then their supremum.
Consequently, for a fixed $\varepsilon > 0$,

$$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(b_k - a_k) \text{ converges with sum} \le \varepsilon \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \sum_{k<n} (b_k - a_k) \le \varepsilon \ \text{ for every } n \in \mathbb{N},$$

since a supremum is $\le \varepsilon$ exactly when $\varepsilon$ is an upper
bound of the set it is the supremum of ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]). Every
verification of nullity below checks the right-hand condition.

**Closed intervals lose nothing.** A bounded interval with endpoints
$a \le b$ is contained in $[a,b]$ and has the same length ([[def-interval]]), so
a cover by intervals of any of the four bounded forms yields a cover by closed
intervals with the same lengths. The definition is therefore stated with closed
intervals once and for all. Covers by *open* intervals are a genuinely different
demand, and passing to one costs a little extra length: the enlargement
$[a_k,b_k] \subseteq (a_k - \delta_k,\ b_k + \delta_k)$ is carried out where it is
needed, in [[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]] and in
[[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]].

**Both notions are inherited by subsets.** If $B \subseteq A$ and $A$ is null,
then any cover of $A$ covers $B$, so $B$ is null; the same sentence with finite
covers shows a subset of a set of content zero has content zero.

**A finite cover is a countable cover, so content zero implies measure zero.**
Padding the list $[a_0,b_0], \dots, [a_n,b_n]$ with the degenerate intervals
$[0,0]$ for $k > n$ leaves the total length unchanged, by the splitting law for
finite sums ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]). This is recorded as a lemma with its
proof, [[lem-content-zero-implies-null]], because it is cited on its own.

## Remarks

- **The two notions genuinely differ.** $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$ is null and does
  not have content zero ([[cex-null-set-not-of-content-zero]]), so the two
  quantifier patterns, "a sequence of intervals" and "a finite list of
  intervals", are not interchangeable. They do agree for compact sets
  ([[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]]), and the compact case is the only one in
  which content zero is used anywhere on this pair of pages. Nothing is claimed
  about what later pages will do with it.

- **Why "content" and not "measure" for the finite version.** The finite-cover
  notion is the vanishing of the Jordan outer content, and the countable-cover
  notion is the vanishing of the Lebesgue outer measure. Neither outer quantity
  is defined in this library, and no item here assigns a nonzero size to any set:
  every statement is of the shape "can, or cannot, be covered by intervals of
  total length below such and such a bound". That is a deliberate restriction of
  scope at this point in the reading order, not a claim that the general notions
  are unavailable in mathematics.

- **Measure zero is not vacuous and not universal.** No interval with two
  distinct endpoints is null ([[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]]), while
  every at most countable set is ([[lem-countable-sets-are-null]]) and so is the
  uncountable Cantor set ([[thm-cantor-set-properties]]). The three facts
  together are what make the notion worth having.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]) and its absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]).

Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ with
$\varepsilon > 0$. The **$\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\},$$

and the **punctured $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \;=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}.$$

The two descriptions of $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ agree because $|y - x| = 0$ holds
exactly when $y = x$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**A neighbourhood is an open interval.** For every $x$ and every
$\varepsilon > 0$,

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;=\; (x - \varepsilon,\ x + \varepsilon),$$

the interval of [[def-interval]]. Indeed [[lem-of-abs-value]] gives, for
$\varepsilon > 0$, the equivalence $|y - x| < \varepsilon \iff -\varepsilon <
y - x < \varepsilon$, and adding $x$ throughout turns the right-hand side into
$x - \varepsilon < y < x + \varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**The centre lies in its own neighbourhoods.** $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, since
$|x - x| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**Punctured neighbourhoods are never empty.** The element
$y := x + \varepsilon/2$ satisfies $|y - x| = \varepsilon/2$, which is
$> 0$ and $< \varepsilon$, so $y \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$
([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

**Monotonicity in the radius.** If $0 < \delta \le \varepsilon$ then
$N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, because $|y - x| < \delta \le
\varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**Nesting at an interior point.** If $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and
$0 < \delta \le \varepsilon - |y - x|$, then

$$N_\delta(y) \;\subseteq\; N_\varepsilon(x).$$

Indeed for $z \in N_\delta(y)$ the triangle inequality
([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]) gives
$|z - x| = |(z - y) + (y - x)| \le |z - y| + |y - x| < \delta + |y - x| \le
\varepsilon$. Note that $\varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ precisely because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, so such a $\delta$ always exists.

## Remarks

- **The radius is a real number, not a rational.** Nothing on this page tests a
  condition against rational radii only. That convention belongs to
  [[def-real-limit]], where the quantifier is over rational $\varepsilon$ and
  the passage between the rational and the real form is the sanctioned remark of
  [[def-sequence]]. Here $\varepsilon$ ranges over the positive reals
  throughout, and every statement above is proved for an arbitrary positive
  real.

- **Why the punctured version is separated out.** A limit point of a set is a
  point every punctured neighbourhood of which meets the set
  ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and deleting the centre is exactly what stops a point
  of the set from qualifying automatically. The unpunctured condition defines
  the weaker notion of an adherent point, and the difference between the two is
  precisely an isolated point.

- **Nesting is the workhorse.** Almost every openness verification on this page
  has the shape "given $y$ in the set, shrink the radius by the distance
  already travelled", which is the nesting property above. It is recorded here
  once so that no later proof has to redo the triangle inequality in passing.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with interior $A^{\circ}$ and closure
$\overline{A}$ as in [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]].

- $A$ is **nowhere dense** when the interior of its closure is empty:
  $$\big(\overline{A}\big)^{\circ} \;=\; \varnothing .$$
- $A$ is **meager**, or **of the first category**, when there is a sequence
  $(A_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of nowhere dense subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ with
  $$A \;=\; \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n .$$
- $A$ is **of the second category** when it is not meager.
- $A$ is **residual** (also *comeager*) when $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ is meager.

**Why a sequence, and why that is the same as "an at most countable union".**
Sequences here are indexed by $\mathbb{N}$, which contains $0$. A finite family
$A_0, \dots, A_m$ of nowhere dense sets is turned into a sequence by setting
$A_n := \varnothing$ for $n > m$, and $\varnothing$ is nowhere dense because
$\overline{\varnothing} = \varnothing$ has empty interior; the empty family is
handled the same way and gives $A = \varnothing$. So "a union of an at most
countable family of nowhere dense sets" ([[def-countable]]) and the displayed
condition define the same class, and the sequence form is used below because it
carries an explicit index and needs no case split.

**Nowhere dense means exactly that the complement of the closure is dense.**
For $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$,

$$\big(\overline{A}\big)^{\circ} = \varnothing \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A} \text{ is dense in } \mathbb{R} .$$

Indeed, by the pointwise description of the interior
([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]), $(\overline{A})^{\circ} = \varnothing$
says that no $x \in \mathbb{R}$ admits a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with
$N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq \overline{A}$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), that is,
that every $N_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $\mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A}$. By
claim 1 of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] that says precisely that every
$x \in \mathbb{R}$ is adherent to $\mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A}$, that is,
$\overline{\mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A}} = \mathbb{R}$, which is density
([[def-limit-point-r]]).

**A closed set is nowhere dense exactly when its interior is empty**, since a
closed set equals its own closure (claim 4 of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]],
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]). This is the form in which nowhere density is
verified nearly every time below. (The phrase *almost everywhere* is avoided
throughout this pair: it is a measure-theoretic term, and the only measure notion
defined here is measure zero.)

**Both classes are closed downwards.** If $B \subseteq A$ then
$\overline{B} \subseteq \overline{A}$ and hence
$(\overline{B})^{\circ} \subseteq (\overline{A})^{\circ}$
([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]), so a subset of a nowhere dense set is
nowhere dense. If $B \subseteq A = \bigcup_n A_n$ with each $A_n$ nowhere dense,
then $B = \bigcup_n (A_n \cap B)$ and each $A_n \cap B$ is nowhere dense by the
previous sentence, so a subset of a meager set is meager.

**A union of two meager sets is meager.** Let $M = \bigcup_n A_n$ and
$M' = \bigcup_n B_n$ with all $A_n$ and all $B_n$ nowhere dense; fixing one
witnessing sequence for $M$ and one for $M'$ is two instantiations of an
existential statement, not a choice principle. Let
$J : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ be a bijection
([[thm-n-cross-n-countable]]) and define a sequence $(C_j)_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ by

$$C_{J(m,n)} \;:=\; \begin{cases} A_n & m = 0, \\ B_n & m \ne 0. \end{cases}$$

This is a total definition because $J$ is a bijection, every $C_j$ is nowhere
dense, and $\bigcup_j C_j = M \cup M'$, since $A_n = C_{J(0,n)}$ and
$B_n = C_{J(1,n)}$ and every $C_j$ is one of the $A_n$ or one of the $B_n$.

## Remarks

- **The countably infinite version of the last observation is a different
  statement.** To show that $\bigcup_i M_i$ is meager for a sequence $(M_i)$ of
  meager sets one must select a witnessing sequence of nowhere dense sets for
  every $i$ at once, which is an application of countable choice
  ([[def-countable-choice]]); the two-set case above avoids it because two
  selections are two instantiations. Nothing on this page uses the countably
  infinite version, and every meager set met below is presented together with an
  explicit witnessing sequence.

- **Nowhere dense is strictly stronger than having empty interior.**
  $\mathbb{Q}$ has empty interior, since no neighbourhood consists of rationals
  alone, yet $\overline{\mathbb{Q}} = \mathbb{R}$ has interior $\mathbb{R}$, so
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is not nowhere dense. It is nevertheless meager, being a union of
  singletons; that computation is [[cor-q-is-meager-and-not-g-delta]].

- **First category, second category and residual are not a trichotomy.** A set
  is meager or of the second category, and those two are exhaustive and
  exclusive by definition. Residual is a separate condition on the complement: a
  residual set is of the second category once $\mathbb{R}$ is known not to be
  meager in itself ([[thm-baire-category-r]]), but before that theorem nothing
  rules out a set that is both meager and residual.

- **Category is a notion of topological smallness, and it is independent of
  smallness in the sense of measure.** Neither of the two implications between
  "nowhere dense" and "measure zero" ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]])
  holds, and $\mathbb{R}$ itself splits into a meager set and a set of measure
  zero; the three items settling this are
  [[fs-nowhere-dense-implies-measure-zero]],
  [[fs-measure-zero-implies-nowhere-dense]] and
  [[cex-meager-set-of-full-measure]].

## Definition

Let $U, F \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]].

- $U$ is **open** when for every $x \in U$ there is a real $\varepsilon > 0$
  with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$.
- $F$ is **closed** when its complement $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open.
- A set is **clopen** when it is both open and closed.

The whole of the topology of $\mathbb{R}$ developed on this page rests on this
one definition: closedness is *defined* as openness of the complement, and every
other description of a closed set on this page is a theorem
([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]]).

**$\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen.** The condition defining openness
quantifies over the elements of the set, so it holds vacuously for
$\varnothing$; and for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ one has $N_1(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$,
so $\mathbb{R}$ is open. Since each of the two is the complement of the other,
each is also closed.

**Every neighbourhood is open.** Let $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and put
$\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x|$, which is $> 0$ because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$. The nesting property of [[def-neighbourhood-r]] gives
$N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$. So every point of $N_\varepsilon(x)$
has a neighbourhood inside it.

**The four open forms of [[def-interval]] are open sets.** Let $a, b \in
\mathbb{R}$.

- $(a,b)$: for $x$ with $a < x < b$, both $x - a > 0$ and $b - x > 0$, so
  $\delta := \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ is a positive real (the minimum of a
  two-element set of reals exists, [[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).
  If $|y - x| < \delta$ then $y > x - \delta \ge x - (x - a) = a$ and
  $y < x + \delta \le x + (b - x) = b$, so $y \in (a,b)$; hence
  $N_\delta(x) \subseteq (a,b)$.
- $(a,\infty)$: for $x > a$ take $\delta := x - a > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y > x - \delta = a$.
- $(-\infty,b)$: for $x < b$ take $\delta := b - x > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y < x + \delta = b$.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: already treated above.

**The four closed forms of [[def-interval]] are closed sets.** In each case the
complement is shown open directly.

- $[a,b]$: if $x \notin [a,b]$ then $x < a$ or $x > b$ by trichotomy
  ([[def-ordered-field]]). If $x < a$, take $\delta := a - x > 0$; every
  $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has $y < x + \delta = a$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. If
  $x > b$, take $\delta := x - b > 0$; every $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has
  $y > x - \delta = b$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. So
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus [a,b]$ is open.
- $[a,\infty)$: its complement is $(-\infty,a)$, which is open by the previous
  paragraph.
- $(-\infty,b]$: its complement is $(b,\infty)$, which is open.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: its complement is $\varnothing$, which is
  open.

## Remarks

- **Open and closed are not opposites, and not exhaustive.** A set may be
  neither: the half-open interval $[0,1)$ is neither open nor closed
  ([[fs-every-set-is-open-or-closed]]). A set may be both: $\varnothing$ and
  $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen. The words are inherited from the interval terminology
  of [[def-interval]], and the agreement between the two usages is exactly the
  two lists verified above: an interval called open there is an open set here,
  and an interval called closed there is a closed set here.

- **A clopen set is a disconnection waiting to happen.** If $A$ is clopen and
  both $A$ and $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ are nonempty, then each of the two is
  its own closure, so the two are separated in the sense of
  [[def-connected-r]] and $\mathbb{R} = A \cup (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)$ is a
  disconnection. Since $\mathbb{R}$ is order-convex it is connected
  ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]]), so no such $A$ exists:
  $\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are the only clopen subsets of $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The half-open forms are the ones the two lists omit**, and deliberately so:
  $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ with $a < b$ are neither open nor closed as subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The radius depends on the point.** Openness asks for *some* $\varepsilon$
  at each point, and that $\varepsilon$ may shrink to nothing as the point
  approaches the edge of the set, as the computation for $(a,b)$ shows: there
  $\delta = \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ tends to $0$ as $x$ tends to either endpoint.
  Asking instead for a single $\varepsilon$ that works simultaneously at every
  point of the set is a strictly stronger condition, and it is not what is
  defined here; nothing on this page uses it.

## Example

$\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable ([[def-countable]]), by [[thm-baire-category-r]]: a
singleton is nowhere dense, so a listing of $\mathbb{R}$ would present
$\mathbb{R}$ as a countable union of nowhere dense sets, which the Baire theorem
forbids.

This is the third proof of the fact in this library. The first is Cantor's
nested-interval argument of 1874 ([[thm-r-uncountable]]); the second is the
perfect-set theorem applied to a closed interval
([[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]]); this one isolates what the first two have in
common, namely completeness used through nested intervals, and packages it once.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The complete ordered field $\mathbb{R}$.

[L1] If $(A_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence of nowhere dense subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ then $\bigcup_n A_n \ne \mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-baire-category-r]]).

[L2] A closed set is nowhere dense exactly when its interior is empty ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]]).

[L3] $U$ is open when every point of it has a neighbourhood inside it, $F$ is closed when its complement is open, and $N_\varepsilon(x) = (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon)$ contains $x$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L4] A nonempty at most countable set admits a surjection from $\mathbb{N}$, and uncountable means not at most countable ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]], [[def-countable]], [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L5] $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable, by Cantor's nested-interval argument ([[thm-r-uncountable]]).

[L6] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 > 0$ and $0 < \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} < \varepsilon$ for $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Verification

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For $c \in \mathbb{R}$ the singleton $\{c\}$ is nowhere dense: it is closed, since $x \ne c$ gives $N_{|x-c|}(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus \{c\}$ by [L3]; and its interior is empty, since for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the point $c + \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$ lies in $N_\varepsilon(c)$ and differs from $c$ by [L6], so no neighbourhood of $c$ is contained in $\{c\}$. By [L2] it is nowhere dense. [L2, L3, L6]

2.1 Let $s : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be any function. The sets $A_n := \{s(n)\}$ are nowhere dense by step 1.1, so $\bigcup_n A_n \ne \mathbb{R}$ by [L1]; but $\bigcup_n A_n$ is exactly the image of $s$, so $s$ is not surjective. [step 1.1, L1]

3.1 Hence there is no surjection $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$. Since $\mathbb{R}$ is nonempty, [L4] gives that $\mathbb{R}$ is not at most countable, that is, $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable, which is [L5] reproved along an independent route. [step 2.1, L4, L5] ∎

## Remarks

- **The proof is not circular.** [[thm-baire-category-r]] is proved from the
  nested interval property and an enumeration of $\mathbb{Q}$, and it nowhere uses
  the uncountability of $\mathbb{R}$; nor does it use
  [[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]]. What it shares with both is
  [[thm-nested-interval-property]], and that is the one ingredient no proof of
  uncountability here avoids.

- **It proves more than uncountability.** The same argument shows that
  $\mathbb{R}$ is not a countable union of nowhere dense sets, of which "not a
  countable union of singletons" is the weakest case. So it also shows, for
  instance, that $\mathbb{R}$ is not the union of countably many Cantor sets,
  each of which is nowhere dense ([[thm-cantor-set-properties]]).

- **What it does not give.** It gives no cardinality beyond "not at most
  countable", and in particular says nothing about a bijection with
  $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$. For the Cantor set that stronger information is
  available through the digit description
  ([[thm-cantor-set-ternary-description]]), and it is what makes
  [[fs-cantor-set-countable]] fail so badly.

## Statement

The map $q \mapsto \hat q$ ([[def-real-numbers]]) is an embedding of ordered
fields. Every real is approximated by rationals: for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and
rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ with
$|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$. Consequently, strictly between any two
reals lies a rational.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real $x = [(a_n)]$ and a rational $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] The orders of $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}$; ordered-field arithmetic ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Field arithmetic in $\mathbb{Q}$: $\varepsilon/2, \delta/4$ are positive rationals, and every nonzero rational $q$ has a reciprocal $1/q$ with $q \cdot (1/q) = 1$ ([[thm-rat-field]]).

[L3] Cauchy definition ([[def-rational-cauchy-sequence]]).

[L4] Real positivity via eventual rational lower bounds ([[def-real-order]]).

[L5] $\mathbb{R} = \mathcal{C}/\mathcal{N}$ is a field ([[thm-reals-field]]), and $0_{\mathbb{R}} = \hat 0$, $1_{\mathbb{R}} = \hat 1$ are the classes of the constant sequences ([[def-real-numbers]]). A multiplicative inverse there is unique: if $ab = 1_{\mathbb{R}} = ac$ then $b = b(ac) = (ba)c = c$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Embedding: constant sequences are Cauchy; $\hat q = \hat r$ iff the constant $q - r$ is null iff $q = r$; operations match termwise; and $q < r$ gives the constant lower bound $r - q > 0$, so $\hat q < \hat r$ and order is preserved and reflected. [L1, L4]

1.2 Fix $N$ with $|a_m - a_n| < \varepsilon/2$ for all $m, n \ge N$, and set $q = a_N$. [L3, L2]

2.1 The difference $\hat q - x$ has representative $(a_N - a_n)$ with $|a_N - a_n| < \varepsilon/2$ for $n \ge N$; hence both $\hat\varepsilon - (x - \hat q)$ and $\hat\varepsilon - (\hat q - x)$ have representatives eventually $> \varepsilon/2$, so both are positive: $|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$. [step 1.2, L4, L1]

2.2 Inverses: let $q$ be a nonzero rational. Then $\hat q \ne \hat 0 = 0_{\mathbb{R}}$ by the injectivity of step 1.1, and $1/q$ exists in $\mathbb{Q}$ by [L2]; since the operations match termwise (step 1.1), $\hat q \cdot \widehat{1/q} = \widehat{q \cdot (1/q)} = \hat 1 = 1_{\mathbb{R}}$. Inverses in $\mathbb{R}$ are unique by [L5], so $(\hat q)^{-1} = \widehat{1/q}$: the embedding preserves reciprocals. [step 1.1, L2, L5]

3.1 Density: let $x < y$; pick $\delta > 0$ rational and $N$ with the representative of $y - x$ eventually $> \delta$; set $\varepsilon = \delta/4$ and pick $q$ with $|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$; then $q' = q + 2\varepsilon$ satisfies $\hat q' - x \ge -\hat\varepsilon + 2\hat\varepsilon = \hat\varepsilon > 0$ and $y - \hat q' \ge \hat\delta - \hat\varepsilon - 2\hat\varepsilon = \hat\delta/4 > 0$, so $x < \hat q' < y$. [step 2.1, L4, L1, L2]

4.1 The rationals embed as an ordered subfield — injectively, preserving the order in both directions, the ring operations, and reciprocals — and they approximate every real arbitrarily well and separate any two reals. [step 1.1, step 2.2, step 3.1] ∎

pipeline_run: null
---

## Remark

**What the proof on this page spends.** The proof of [[thm-baire-category-r]]
uses exactly four things: the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]), the
well-ordering principle for $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]), the
nested interval property ([[thm-nested-interval-property]]), and one fixed
enumeration of the rationals ([[thm-rationals-countable]],
[[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]). None of these is a choice principle. The enumeration
is a single object, fixed once by one instantiation of an existential statement;
the interval used at stage $k$ is the one whose two rational endpoints have least
index among those meeting the requirements, and "least" is determined by
[[thm-well-ordering-principle]]; so the successor rule is a *function*, and the
whole construction is one application of [[thm-recursion]] to it. In particular
the proof does not use countable choice ([[def-countable-choice]]), which the
neighbouring measure-theoretic results on this page do use.

**What the naive proof would spend, and why.** The textbook argument says: given
the interval produced at stage $k$, *choose* an interval inside it meeting
$U_{k+1}$, and repeat. Each choice is made from a nonempty set that depends on
the previous choice, and it is made infinitely often. That pattern is not
countable choice, which selects from a family fixed in advance; it is the axiom
of dependent choice ([[def-dependent-choice]]). Replacing the choice by a canonical rule is the only edit
the argument needs, and fixing an enumeration of a dense set in advance is what
makes a canonical rule available.

**What this does NOT establish.** It establishes nothing about the Baire category
theorem for complete metric spaces in general. That statement is genuinely
stronger, and how much stronger is recorded, with references and without proof,
in [[rem-baire-category-choice-strength]]: over ZF the metric version is
equivalent to dependent choice, whereas its restriction to spaces with a
countable dense subset is a theorem of ZF, "a fixed countable dense set removes
every choice from the construction". The proof of [[thm-baire-category-r]] is
precisely that restricted argument, specialised to $\mathbb{R}$ with the
rationals as the countable dense set. So the correct summary is:

- the statement proved here, for $\mathbb{R}$, needs no choice principle;
- the general metric statement is not proved here at all, and is not a corollary
  of what is proved here;
- the strength of that general statement over ZF is quoted from the literature in
  [[rem-baire-category-choice-strength]], which this library does not prove.

**Why the distinction is worth a separate item.** The two statements are
routinely called by the same name, and a reader who has seen "Baire needs
dependent choice" may reasonably suspect the proof above of hiding an appeal to
it. It does not, and the place to look is the successor rule: it takes a minimum
over $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ rather than picking a witness. The same device
appears in [[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]], and in both places it is the
enumeration of $\mathbb{Q}$ that pays for it.

**A note on the surrounding page.** Choice is not avoided everywhere here.
[[thm-countable-union-of-null-is-null]] spends countable choice at one clearly
marked step, and says so; [[lem-countable-sets-are-null]] and
[[thm-cantor-set-properties]] spend none. The page is arranged so that each
appeal is visible where it happens rather than absorbed into a general
convention.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with closure $\overline{A}$ as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]] and derived set $A'$ as in
[[def-limit-point-r]]. Write

$$E \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing \text{ for every real } \varepsilon > 0 \,\}$$

for the set of adherent points of $A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). Then:

1. $\overline{A} = E$.
2. $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$.
3. $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed superset of $A$: it is closed, it
   contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed $F$ with $A \subseteq F$.
4. $A$ is closed if and only if $A = \overline{A}$, if and only if
   $A' \subseteq A$.

Claim 3 is the content of the definition of $\overline{A}$ and is restated here
so that the four descriptions stand together; claims 1, 2 and 4 are the ones
that carry work.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, and the set $E$ of adherent points of $A$ as displayed in the Statement.

[L1] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; $F$ is closed when $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L2] $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$; $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) = N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$; and if $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ then $\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ and $N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] $\overline{A}$ is the intersection of the nonempty family of closed supersets of $A$; it is closed, it contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed superset of $A$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]).

[L4] $x$ is an adherent point of $A$ when every $N_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $A$, a limit point when every $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $A$, and $A'$ is the set of limit points ([[def-limit-point-r]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $A \subseteq E$: for $x \in A$ and any $\varepsilon > 0$ one has $x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$, so that intersection is nonempty. [L2, L4]

1.2 Let $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus E$; by the definition of $E$ there is a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$. [L4, choose]

1.3 Let $F$ be closed with $A \subseteq F$, and let $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus F$; since $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open there is a real $\eta > 0$ with $N_\eta(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus F$. [L1, choose]

2.1 For every $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ the radius $\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x|$ is positive and $N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, so $N_\delta(y) \cap A = \varnothing$ and $y \notin E$; hence $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$, and since $x$ was an arbitrary point of $\mathbb{R} \setminus E$ that set is open, that is, $E$ is closed. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L4]

2.2 From $N_\eta(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus F \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus A$ we get $N_\eta(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, so $x \notin E$; hence $\mathbb{R} \setminus F \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$, that is, $E \subseteq F$, for every closed $F \supseteq A$. [step 1.3, L4]

3.1 By steps 1.1 and 2.1 the set $E$ is a closed superset of $A$, so $\overline{A} \subseteq E$ by the leastness in [L3]; and $\overline{A}$ is itself a closed superset of $A$ by [L3], so step 2.2 applied to $F = \overline{A}$ gives $E \subseteq \overline{A}$. Hence $\overline{A} = E$, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, L3]

4.1 $E = A \cup A'$: if $x \in E$ and $x \notin A$ then for every $\varepsilon > 0$ some $a \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ exists, and $a \ne x$ because $x \notin A$, so $a \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ and $x \in A'$; conversely $A \subseteq E$ by step 1.1, and $A' \subseteq E$ because $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$. Combining with step 3.1 gives $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$, which is claim 2. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L2, L4]

5.1 Claim 4: if $A$ is closed then $A$ is a closed superset of itself, so $\overline{A} \subseteq A$ by [L3], while $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ by [L3], whence $A = \overline{A}$; conversely if $A = \overline{A}$ then $A$ is closed because $\overline{A}$ is. Finally $A = \overline{A}$ says $A = A \cup A'$ by step 4.1, and $A = A \cup A'$ holds exactly when $A' \subseteq A$. [step 4.1, L3]

6.1 Claim 3 is [L3] restated, and claims 1, 2 and 4 are steps 3.1, 4.1 and 5.1, so all four hold. [step 3.1, step 4.1, step 5.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Which claim does the work in practice.** Claim 1 is the one used almost
  everywhere below: to show a point lies in $\overline{A}$ one exhibits, for each
  $\varepsilon > 0$, a point of $A$ within $\varepsilon$ of it. Claim 2 is what
  separates the two ways a point can be adherent, by membership or by
  accumulation, and it is what makes the notion of an isolated point visible.

- **No special property of $\mathbb{R}$ is used.** The argument uses the
  definitions of open, closed, neighbourhood and closure, and the order enters
  only through the nesting property of neighbourhoods; neither the
  least-upper-bound property nor the Archimedean property appears at any step.
  The results of this page that do use them are flagged in
  [[rem-r-native-topology-scope]].

- **The sequential form is a separate theorem and costs more.** Replacing
  "every neighbourhood meets $A$" by "some sequence in $A$ converges to $x$" is
  [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]], and the passage from the
  first to the second spends the axiom of countable choice, since it selects one
  point of $A$ from each of infinitely many neighbourhoods. The characterisation
  proved above is choice free.

## Statement

For each $k \in \mathbb{N}$ let $I_k = [a_k, b_k]$ be a closed bounded interval
with $a_k \le b_k$ ([[def-interval]]), and suppose the family is **nested**:

$$I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k \qquad (k \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Write $\ell_k = b_k - a_k \ge 0$ for the length of $I_k$. Then:

1. $\displaystyle\bigcap_{k \in \mathbb{N}} I_k$ is **nonempty**. More precisely,
   with $a = \sup\{a_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$ and
   $b = \inf\{b_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$, both of which exist, one has $a \le b$
   and $$\bigcap_{k \in \mathbb{N}} I_k = [a, b].$$
2. $\displaystyle\bigcap_{k \in \mathbb{N}} I_k$ is a **single point** if and only
   if $\ell_k \to 0$ ([[def-real-limit]]).

Every hypothesis is load bearing. Dropping closedness makes the intersection
empty; dropping boundedness does the same; and dropping nonemptiness of the
individual intervals is vacuously fatal.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Closed bounded intervals $I_k = [a_k, b_k]$ with $a_k \le b_k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and $I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k$ for every $k$; the sequences $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ of reals ([[def-sequence]]); their ranges $A = \{a_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$ and $B = \{b_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$, both nonempty; and $\ell_k = b_k - a_k$.

[L1] Closed bounded intervals: $[a,b] = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : a \le x \le b\}$; it is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, it is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$, it has two distinct elements $a$ and $b$ when $a < b$, and its length is $b - a$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L2] Least-upper-bound property and uniqueness: a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ bounded above has a unique supremum; the supremum is an upper bound and is $\le$ every upper bound ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L3] Greatest-lower-bound property and uniqueness: a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ bounded below has a unique infimum; the infimum is a lower bound and is $\ge$ every lower bound ([[thm-infimum-property]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L4] Monotone sequences, and the fact that consecutive comparisons suffice: $x_k \le x_{k+1}$ for all $k$ makes $(x_k)$ nondecreasing, and $x_{k+1} \le x_k$ for all $k$ makes it nonincreasing ([[def-monotone-sequence]]).

[L5] Monotone convergence: a nondecreasing sequence whose range is bounded above converges to the supremum of its range, and a nonincreasing sequence whose range is bounded below converges to the infimum ([[thm-monotone-convergence]]).

[L6] Algebra of limits: if $u_k \to u$ and $v_k \to v$ then $u_k - v_k \to u - v$ ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]]).

[L7] A sequence of reals has at most one limit ([[lem-limit-unique]]).

[L8] Bounded above and bounded below, for a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-bounded-set]]).

[L9] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total and transitive, so any two indices $k, l$ admit an index $m$ with $k \le m$ and $l \le m$, namely the larger of the two ([[def-nat-order]], [[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Nestedness read on the endpoints: since $a_{k+1} \le b_{k+1}$, both $a_{k+1}$ and $b_{k+1}$ lie in $I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k$, so $a_k \le a_{k+1}$ and $b_{k+1} \le b_k$ for every $k$. [given, L1]

2.1 Hence $(a_k)$ is nondecreasing and $(b_k)$ is nonincreasing. [step 1.1, L4]

3.1 For all indices $k$ and $l$: choosing $m$ with $k \le m$ and $l \le m$ gives $a_k \le a_m \le b_m \le b_l$, so $a_k \le b_l$. [step 2.1, given, L9]

4.1 Every $b_l$ is therefore an upper bound of $A$ and every $a_k$ a lower bound of $B$; both sets are nonempty, so $a := \sup A$ and $b := \inf B$ exist and are unique. [step 3.1, L2, L3, L8]

5.1 $a \le b$: each $b_l$ is an upper bound of $A$, so $a \le b_l$ for every $l$ by leastness of the supremum; thus $a$ is a lower bound of $B$, and $a \le b$ by greatestness of the infimum. [step 4.1, L2, L3]

5.2 By monotone convergence, $a_k \to a$ and $b_k \to b$. [step 2.1, step 4.1, L5]

5.3 The intersection is exactly $[a,b]$: a real $x$ lies in every $I_k$ exactly when $a_k \le x \le b_k$ for every $k$, that is exactly when $x$ is an upper bound of $A$ and a lower bound of $B$, and by leastness of $a$ and greatestness of $b$ that holds exactly when $a \le x \le b$. [step 4.1, L1, L2, L3]

6.1 $\ell_k = b_k - a_k \to b - a$ by the algebra of limits. [step 5.2, L6]

6.2 Since $a \le b$, the interval $[a,b]$ is nonempty, so the intersection is nonempty; together with step 5.3 this is claim 1. [step 5.1, step 5.3, L1]

7.1 If $\ell_k \to 0$ then $b - a = 0$ by uniqueness of limits, so $a = b$ and the intersection is $[a,a] = \{a\}$, a single point. [step 5.3, step 6.1, L1, L7]

7.2 Conversely, if the intersection is a single point then $a = b$: it equals $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, and $a < b$ would give the two distinct elements $a$ and $b$. Hence $b - a = 0$ and $\ell_k \to 0$ by step 6.1. [step 5.1, step 5.3, step 6.1, L1]

8.1 Claim 1 is step 6.2 and claim 2 is the pair of implications in steps 7.1 and 7.2, so a nested sequence of nonempty closed bounded intervals has nonempty intersection, equal to $[a,b]$, and that intersection is a single point exactly when the lengths tend to $0$. [step 6.2, step 7.1, step 7.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **No Archimedean input is needed.** The lengths are handled entirely by the
  algebra of limits and the uniqueness of limits: $\ell_k$ always converges, to
  $b - a$, and the two directions of claim 2 are then the two directions of
  "$b - a = 0$". A proof that instead argues "if $b - a > 0$ then some $\ell_k$
  is smaller" does need the Archimedean property
  ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]]), and it is avoidable, so it is avoided.

- **Nestedness gives more than it is usually stated to give.** The intersection
  is not merely nonempty; it is the closed interval $[a,b]$, and $a$ and $b$ are
  the limits of the endpoint sequences. The single-point case is exactly the case
  in which those two limits agree, and that is what makes the nested interval
  property usable as a *construction* of a real number, as in
  [[ex-nested-intervals-single-point]].

- **This is one of the standard equivalents of completeness.** Nested intervals
  together with the Archimedean property imply the least-upper-bound property, so
  the implication proved here is not reversible for free: it is half of an
  equivalence whose other half needs the Archimedean hypothesis separately.
  [[rem-completeness-routes]] records where this library stands on those routes.

- **The witnesses for the two deleted hypotheses** are
  [[cex-nested-open-intervals-empty]], which keeps boundedness and drops
  closedness, and [[cex-nested-unbounded-closed-empty]], which keeps closedness
  and drops boundedness. Neither is used above; each shows that the corresponding
  hypothesis cannot be removed.

## Statement

Let open and closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ be as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

1. **Arbitrary unions of open sets are open.** If $\mathcal{U}$ is any family of
   open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, then $\bigcup \mathcal{U}$ is open.
2. **Finite intersections of open sets are open.** If $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
   $U_0, \dots, U_n$ are open, then $U_0 \cap \dots \cap U_n$ is open.
3. **Arbitrary intersections of closed sets are closed.** If $\mathcal{F}$ is a
   nonempty family of closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, then
   $\bigcap \mathcal{F}$ is closed.
4. **Finite unions of closed sets are closed.** If $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
   $F_0, \dots, F_n$ are closed, then $F_0 \cup \dots \cup F_n$ is closed.

The word *finite* in claims 2 and 4 is not decoration: an arbitrary
intersection of open sets need not be open, and dually an arbitrary union
of closed sets need not be closed; the remarks below say where that is settled.
Claim 3 asks $\mathcal{F}$ to be nonempty
only so that $\bigcap \mathcal{F}$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ without appeal to
a convention about the empty intersection.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A family $\mathcal{U}$ of open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, with $\bigcup \mathcal{U} = \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \in U \text{ for some } U \in \mathcal{U} \,\}$; a natural number $n$ and open sets $U_0, \dots, U_n$; a nonempty family $\mathcal{F}$ of closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, with $\bigcap \mathcal{F} = \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \in F \text{ for every } F \in \mathcal{F} \,\}$; and closed sets $F_0, \dots, F_n$.

[A1] De Morgan's laws in the ambient set theory: for a nonempty family $\mathcal{G}$ of subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{R} \setminus \bigcap \mathcal{G} = \bigcup \{\, \mathbb{R} \setminus G : G \in \mathcal{G} \,\}$, and $\mathbb{R} \setminus (G_0 \cup \dots \cup G_n) = (\mathbb{R} \setminus G_0) \cap \dots \cap (\mathbb{R} \setminus G_n)$. Also $\mathbb{R} \setminus (\mathbb{R} \setminus G) = G$.

[L1] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; $F$ is closed when $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L2] $N_\varepsilon(x) = \{\, y : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}$, and $0 < \delta \le \varepsilon$ gives $N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] Every nonempty finite set of reals has a minimum, so $\min\{\varepsilon, \eta\}$ is defined and equals one of the two entries, and is $\le$ both ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $x \in \bigcup \mathcal{U}$. Then $x \in U$ for some $U \in \mathcal{U}$, and $U$ is open, so there is $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{U}$; as $x$ was arbitrary, $\bigcup \mathcal{U}$ is open, which is claim 1. [given, L1, choose]

1.2 Now let $U$ and $V$ be open and let $x \in U \cap V$; fix $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$ and $\eta > 0$ with $N_\eta(x) \subseteq V$. [given, L1, choose]

2.1 Put $\delta := \min\{\varepsilon, \eta\}$, which is one of $\varepsilon, \eta$ and hence $> 0$, and satisfies $\delta \le \varepsilon$ and $\delta \le \eta$; then $N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$ and $N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\eta(x) \subseteq V$, so $N_\delta(x) \subseteq U \cap V$, and as $x$ was arbitrary $U \cap V$ is open. [step 1.2, L2, L3]

2.2 The family $\{\, \mathbb{R} \setminus F : F \in \mathcal{F} \,\}$ consists of open sets by [L1], so its union is open by step 1.1; that union is $\mathbb{R} \setminus \bigcap \mathcal{F}$ by [A1], so $\bigcap \mathcal{F}$ is closed, which is claim 3. [step 1.1, A1, L1]

3.1 Claim 2 now follows by induction on $n$: for $n = 0$ the intersection is $U_0$, which is open by hypothesis; and if $W := U_0 \cap \dots \cap U_n$ is open then $U_0 \cap \dots \cap U_{n+1} = W \cap U_{n+1}$ is an intersection of two open sets, hence open by step 2.1. [step 2.1, given]

4.1 Each $\mathbb{R} \setminus F_i$ is open by [L1], so $(\mathbb{R} \setminus F_0) \cap \dots \cap (\mathbb{R} \setminus F_n)$ is open by step 3.1; that set is $\mathbb{R} \setminus (F_0 \cup \dots \cup F_n)$ by [A1], so $F_0 \cup \dots \cup F_n$ is closed, which is claim 4. [step 3.1, A1, L1]

5.1 Claims 1, 2, 3 and 4 are steps 1.1, 3.1, 2.2 and 4.1 respectively, so arbitrary unions and finite intersections of open sets are open, and arbitrary intersections and finite unions of closed sets are closed. [step 1.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, step 4.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Completeness plays no part.** Nothing above uses the least-upper-bound
  property, or even the Archimedean property: the only facts about $\mathbb{R}$
  the proof touches are the definition of a neighbourhood, its monotonicity in
  the radius, and the comparison of two positive radii. What needs completeness
  is not the algebra of open sets but the theorems about compactness that come
  later.

- **Why finiteness cannot be dropped in claim 2.** The minimum taken in step 2.1
  is a minimum of finitely many positive radii, and it is positive precisely
  because it is one of them ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]). An infinite family of
  positive radii has an infimum that may be $0$, and then no positive $\delta$
  survives. That is exactly what happens for the shrinking intervals of
  [[fs-arbitrary-intersection-of-open-is-open]], whose named witness is
  [[cex-intersection-of-shrinking-intervals-not-open]].

- **The four claims are a rewriting of two.** Claims 3 and 4 are claims 1 and 2
  read through complementation, and closedness is *defined* by complementation
  ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), so no separate argument about closed sets is
  possible or needed.

## Statement

Let $P \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be nonempty and perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]).
Then $P$ is uncountable ([[def-countable]]).

**The selection is canonical, so that this proof spends no dependent choice.**
The textbook proof shrinks a neighbourhood at every stage by *choosing* a point
of $P$ and then a radius, a choice made infinitely often and each time depending
on the previous one: that is the axiom of dependent choice
([[def-dependent-choice]]), which is not available at this point in the reading
order; only the axiom of countable choice is, and it does not
licence a recursive selection. The construction below therefore fixes an
enumeration $e$ of the rationals once ([[thm-rationals-countable]],
[[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) and, at every stage, takes the interval with
**least-indexed rational endpoints** meeting the requirements. The requirements
are met by some rational-endpoint interval, which is what step 2.1 proves, and
the least such index is determined by [[thm-well-ordering-principle]], so the
whole recursion is a single application of [[thm-recursion]] to a total map and
no choice principle is used anywhere.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A nonempty perfect set $P \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Write $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the image of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ under $q \mapsto \hat q$. A pair $(p,q) \in \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \times \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is called **good** when $p < q$ and $(p,q) \cap P \ne \varnothing$, and $G$ denotes the set of good pairs.

[L1] $P$ is perfect: $P$ is closed and every $x \in P$ is a limit point of $P$, so every punctured neighbourhood of $x$ meets $P$ ([[def-perfect-set-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L2] $\overline{A}$ is the set of points every neighbourhood of which meets $A$, and $A$ is closed exactly when $A = \overline{A}$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L3] $N_\varepsilon(x) = (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon)$; $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$; $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) = N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\}$; and $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ with $0 < \delta \le \varepsilon - |y - x|$ gives $N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L4] Intervals: $(p,q)$ is an open set and $[p,q]$ is a closed bounded interval, nonempty when $p \le q$ ([[def-interval]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L5] A nonempty at most countable set admits a surjection from $\mathbb{N}$; uncountable means not at most countable ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]], [[def-countable]]).

[L6] $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-rationals-countable]]); $q \mapsto \hat q$ is injective with image $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and strictly between any two reals lies an element of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]); a composition of bijections is a bijection ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]], [[def-equinumerous]]).

[L7] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L8] Recursion: for a set $Y$, an element $y_0 \in Y$ and a function $T : Y \to Y$ there is $h : \mathbb{N} \to Y$ with $h(0) = y_0$ and $h(\sigma(k)) = T(h(k))$ ([[thm-recursion]]).

[L9] Nested interval property: for nonempty closed bounded intervals $I_k = [a_k,b_k]$ with $I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k$, the intersection is nonempty, and it is a single point exactly when the lengths $b_k - a_k$ tend to $0$ ([[thm-nested-interval-property]]).

[L10] Reciprocal Archimedean property: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]]); canonical naturals are positive and increasing, and reciprocation of positives reverses the order ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

[L11] Every nonempty finite set of reals has a minimum, which is one of its members ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]); $0 < 1$, so $2 := 1+1 > 0$ and $0 < d \cdot 2^{-1} < d$ for $d > 0$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve inequalities ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

[L12] Convergence of a sequence of reals to $0$ is tested against rational $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-real-limit]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L13] Absolute value: $|z| \ge 0$, and $|y - x| \le b - a$ whenever $x, y \in [a,b]$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that the nonempty perfect set $P$ is at most countable; by [L5] fix a surjection $f : \mathbb{N} \to P$. [assume-contra, L5, choose]

1.2 By [L6] fix a bijection $\beta : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$ and put $e := \iota \circ \beta$ with $\iota(q) = \hat q$, a bijection from $\mathbb{N}$ onto $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$. [L6, choose]

1.3 Recall the terminology of the Given: a pair $(p,q)$ of elements of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is good when $p < q$ and $(p,q) \cap P \ne \varnothing$, and $G$ is the set of good pairs. [given, construct]

2.1 **Refinement claim.** For every good $(p,q)$, every $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and every real $\eta > 0$ there is a good $(p',q')$ with $[p',q'] \subseteq (p,q)$, $x \notin [p',q']$ and $q' - p' < \eta$. To see it, fix $y \in (p,q) \cap P$ and, $(p,q)$ being open, a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(y) \subseteq (p,q)$; since $y \in P$ is not isolated, [L1] gives $z \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(y) \cap P$, so $z \in P \cap (p,q)$ and $z \ne y$. At least one of $y, z$ differs from $x$; let $w$ be $y$ if $y \ne x$ and $z$ otherwise, so $w \in P \cap N_\varepsilon(y)$ and $w \ne x$. Put $\delta := \min\{\, \varepsilon - |w - y|,\ |w - x|,\ \eta \cdot 2^{-1} \,\}$, a positive real by [L11] since each entry is positive, and use [L6] to fix $p', q' \in \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ with $w - \delta < p' < w < q' < w + \delta$. Then $[p',q'] \subseteq N_\delta(w) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(y) \subseteq (p,q)$ by [L3], the pair $(p',q')$ is good because $w \in (p',q') \cap P$, the point $x$ lies outside $N_\delta(w)$ because $|x - w| \ge \delta$, and $q' - p' < 2\delta \le \eta$. [step 1.3, L1, L3, L4, L6, L11, choose]

3.1 **Successor rule.** For $(k,(p,q)) \in \mathbb{N} \times G$ let $m$ be the least natural for which some natural $n$ makes $(e(m),e(n))$ good with $[e(m),e(n)] \subseteq (p,q)$, $f(k) \notin [e(m),e(n)]$ and $e(n) - e(m) < 1/(k+1)$, and let $n$ be the least natural with those properties for that $m$; put $T(k,(p,q)) := (\sigma(k), (e(m),e(n)))$. The set of eligible $m$ is nonempty by step 2.1 applied with $x = f(k)$ and $\eta = 1/(k+1) > 0$, since $e$ is onto $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, so both minima exist by [L7] and $T : \mathbb{N} \times G \to \mathbb{N} \times G$ is a total function defined without any selection. [step 2.1, L6, L7, L10, construct]

4.1 **The recursion.** $P$ is nonempty, so fix $y_0 \in P$ and, by [L6], elements $p_0 < y_0 < q_0$ of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$; then $(p_0,q_0)$ is good. Apply [L8] with $Y = \mathbb{N} \times G$, seed $(0,(p_0,q_0))$ and map $T$ to get $h : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times G$ with $h(0) = (0,(p_0,q_0))$ and $h(\sigma(k)) = T(h(k))$; an induction on $k$ shows the first coordinate of $h(k)$ is $k$, so write $h(k) = (k,(p_k,q_k))$ with every $(p_k,q_k)$ good. [step 1.3, step 3.1, L6, L8, construct]

5.1 Writing $I_k := [p_k,q_k]$ and $\ell_k := q_k - p_k > 0$, the rule of step 3.1 gives, for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$: $I_{k+1} \subseteq (p_k,q_k) \subseteq I_k$, so the intervals are nested and nonempty; $f(k) \notin I_{k+1}$; $\ell_{k+1} < 1/(k+1)$; and $I_k \cap P \ne \varnothing$, because $(p_k,q_k) \cap P \ne \varnothing$. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L4]

6.1 For every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $k \ge 1$ with $\ell_k < \varepsilon$, and moreover $\ell_k \to 0$: by step 5.1 one has $\ell_j < 1/j$ for every $j \ge 1$, since $\ell_j = \ell_{(j-1)+1} < 1/((j-1)+1) = 1/j$; given $\varepsilon > 0$, [L10] supplies a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$, and then every $k \ge n$ satisfies $k \ge 1$ and $|\ell_k - 0| = \ell_k < 1/k \le 1/n < \varepsilon$ by [L10] and [L13], which is both assertions, the second by [L12] since a rational $\varepsilon > 0$ is in particular a real one. [step 5.1, L10, L12, L13]

7.1 By [L9] the nested family $(I_k)$ of nonempty closed bounded intervals has an intersection that is a single point, since its lengths tend to $0$ by step 6.1; write $\{x\}$ for it, so $x \in I_k$ for every $k$. [step 5.1, step 6.1, L9]

8.1 $x \in P$: let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real and use step 6.1 to fix $k \ge 1$ with $\ell_k < \varepsilon$; by step 5.1 there is $y \in I_k \cap P$, and $x \in I_k$ by step 7.1, so $|y - x| \le \ell_k < \varepsilon$ by [L13] and $y \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap P$. Every neighbourhood of $x$ therefore meets $P$, so $x \in \overline{P} = P$ by [L1] and [L2]. [step 5.1, step 6.1, step 7.1, L1, L2, L3, L13]

9.1 For every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ one has $x \in I_{k+1}$ by step 7.1 while $f(k) \notin I_{k+1}$ by step 5.1, so $x \ne f(k)$; thus the element $x$ of $P$ found in step 8.1 is not a value of $f$, contradicting the surjectivity of the $f$ fixed in step 1.1. The assumption is therefore untenable: a nonempty perfect subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is not at most countable, that is, it is uncountable. [step 1.1, step 5.1, step 7.1, step 8.1, L5, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Which hypothesis does what.** Closedness of $P$ is used exactly once, at the
  step that puts the limit point $x$ back into $P$; without it the construction
  still produces a point, but that point may lie outside $P$ and the
  contradiction evaporates. Having no isolated points is used exactly once, in
  the refinement claim, to produce a second point of $P$ inside a neighbourhood,
  which is what allows the excluded point $f(k)$ to be dodged. Nonemptiness is
  used to seed the recursion, and it cannot be dropped: $\varnothing$ is perfect
  and countable ([[def-perfect-set-r]]).

- **Why rational endpoints.** They are what make the construction canonical.
  The requirement "some good rational-endpoint interval inside $(p,q)$ misses
  $f(k)$ and is short" is a property of a pair of natural numbers, so it can be
  minimised by [[thm-well-ordering-principle]]; the same requirement stated for
  arbitrary real endpoints comes with no canonical least witness, and picking one
  would be a choice made afresh at every stage. This is the same device that
  keeps
  [[lem-subset-of-countable]] and [[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]] choice
  free, transplanted from subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ to intervals.

- **The shrinking condition is $\ell_{k+1} < 1/(k+1)$ and not $1/k$.** Sequences
  and recursions here are indexed from $0$ ([[def-sequence]]), so the bound
  available at stage $k$ has to be positive at $k = 0$; $1/k$ is undefined
  there. The consequence, $\ell_j < 1/j$ for $j \ge 1$, is what step 6.1 uses,
  and it says nothing about $\ell_0$, which is not needed.

- **The result is sharp in both directions.** A nondegenerate closed interval is
  perfect and uncountable ([[ex-closed-interval-is-perfect]]), and deleting the
  no-isolated-points clause loses the conclusion: a closed set with an isolated
  point need not be perfect
  ([[cex-closed-set-with-an-isolated-point-is-not-perfect]]) and may be
  countable, as $\{\, 1/k : k \ge 1 \,\} \cup \{0\}$ is
  ([[ex-reciprocals-with-zero-are-compact]]). Applied to a
  nondegenerate closed interval, which [[ex-closed-interval-is-perfect]] shows
  to be perfect, the theorem reproves the uncountability of intervals
  ([[cor-interval-uncountable]]) by a different route; the two proofs share
  nothing but the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$, which
  [[cor-interval-uncountable]] spends as a supremum and the argument above
  spends through [[thm-nested-interval-property]].

## Statement

$\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-equinumerous]]): the rationals are
countably infinite ([[def-countable]]).

**No choice principle is used.** The one place where a reader expects a choice,
"pick a representative $a/b$ of each rational", is exactly where
[[lem-rat-positive-denominator]] applies: every rational *has* a representative
with positive denominator, so the map $(a,b) \mapsto [(a,b)]$ defined on
$\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ is already **surjective** onto $\mathbb{Q}$,
and countability follows from a surjection without ever selecting a
representative. The same device handles $\mathbb{Z}$, which is a surjective image
of $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ by construction ([[def-integers]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $\mathbb{Z} = (\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N})/\sim$ with quotient map $(a,b) \mapsto [(a,b)]$ ([[def-integers]]), and $\mathbb{Q}$ the set of classes $[(a,b)]$ of pairs of integers with $b \ne 0$ ([[def-rationals]]). Write $\mathbb{Z}_{>0} = \{\, b \in \mathbb{Z} : b > 0 \,\}$ ([[def-int-order]]).

[L1] Finite, countably infinite, at most countable, uncountable ([[def-countable]]).

[L2] Bijections, injections, surjections, composition; $\approx$ and $\preceq$ ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]], [[def-equinumerous]]).

[L3] A nonempty $X$ is at most countable iff there is a surjection $\mathbb{N} \to X$; and from such a surjection $s$ the map $x \mapsto \min\{\, k : s(k) = x \,\}$ is an injection $X \to \mathbb{N}$ ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]]).

[L4] There is a bijection $\beta : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-n-cross-n-countable]]).

[L5] A product of two at most countable sets is at most countable ([[thm-product-of-countable]]); a subset of an at most countable set is at most countable ([[lem-subset-of-countable]]).

[L6] Every rational is $[(a,b)]$ for some integers $a$ and $b$ with $b > 0$ ([[lem-rat-positive-denominator]]).

[L7] $\mathbb{N}$ embeds injectively in $\mathbb{Z}$ by $n \mapsto [(n,0)]$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]) and $\mathbb{Z}$ embeds injectively in $\mathbb{Q}$ by $k \mapsto [(k,1)]$ ([[lem-int-embeds-rat]]).

[L8] $\preceq$ in both directions gives $\approx$ ([[thm-schroder-bernstein]]).

[L9] The relation of [[def-int-order]] is a total order on $\mathbb{Z}$ compatible with the ring structure ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), and $\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \ne \varnothing$: on representatives $0 < [(a,b)]$ holds exactly when $b < a$ in $\mathbb{N}$ ([[def-int-order]]), and $0 < 1$ in $\mathbb{N}$, since $1 = \sigma(0) \ne 0$ ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]) while $0 < n$ for every nonzero natural $n$ (claim 4 of [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]); so the integer $[(1,0)]$ is positive.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The quotient map $\pi : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$, $\pi(a,b) = [(a,b)]$, is surjective, since every integer is by definition such a class; hence $\pi \circ \beta : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ is a surjection, and $\mathbb{Z} \ne \varnothing$, so $\mathbb{Z}$ is at most countable by [L3]. [given, L2, L3, L4]

1.2 The composite $\iota : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$, $n \mapsto [([(n,0)],1)]$, of the two embeddings of [L7] is injective, so $\mathbb{N} \preceq \mathbb{Q}$. [L2, L7]

2.1 $\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ is a subset of $\mathbb{Z}$, hence at most countable by [L5], and it is nonempty by [L9]; therefore $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ is at most countable by [L5] and nonempty, so [L3] provides a surjection $u : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$. [step 1.1, L3, L5, L9]

3.1 The map $\rho : \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_{>0} \to \mathbb{Q}$, $\rho(a,b) = [(a,b)]$, is well defined because $b > 0$ gives $b \ne 0$, and it is surjective by [L6]; hence $\rho \circ u : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$ is a surjection, $\mathbb{Q}$ is at most countable, and [L3] turns that surjection into an injection $j : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{N}$, so $\mathbb{Q} \preceq \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.1, given, L2, L3, L6]

4.1 From $\mathbb{N} \preceq \mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{Q} \preceq \mathbb{N}$, the Schröder-Bernstein theorem [L8] yields a bijection $\mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{N}$; hence $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ is countably infinite. [step 1.2, step 3.1, L1, L8] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why Schröder-Bernstein rather than a count.** The usual last line is "countable, and infinite because $\mathbb{N}$ injects into it". Turning that into a proof requires knowing that a set containing an injective copy of $\mathbb{N}$ is not finite, which is the pigeonhole principle, [[lem-pigeonhole]], proved earlier on this page. That route is now available, but it is a detour: [[thm-schroder-bernstein]] gets the bijection directly from the two injections already in hand, and it is choice free, so nothing is lost.

- **Lowest terms are not needed and are not available.** A frequent presentation injects $\mathbb{Q}$ into $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{N}$ by sending each rational to its representative in lowest terms. That map needs greatest common divisors, which this library has not developed. Working with a surjection instead of an injection avoids the issue entirely: repetitions in an enumeration are harmless ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]]).

- The proof shows in passing that $\mathbb{Z} \approx \mathbb{N}$, by the same two-injection argument applied to [L7] and step 1.1, and that $\mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{Q}^3$ and so on are countable ([[thm-product-of-countable]]). The contrast with [[thm-r-uncountable]] is the point of the page: adding all limits of rational approximations to $\mathbb{Q}$ changes the size of the set, not merely its arithmetic.

## Statement

Let $(N,0,\sigma)$ be a Peano system ([[def-peano-system]]), in particular the natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]). For any set $A$, any element $a \in A$, and any function $f : A \to A$, there is a unique function $g : N \to A$ such that $g(0) = a$ and $g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n))$ for all $n \in N$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** a Peano system $(N,0,\sigma)$, a set $A$, an element $a \in A$, and a function $f : A \to A$. Call a set $R \subseteq N \times A$ **closed** when $(0,a) \in R$ and, for all $n \in N$ and $x \in A$, $(n,x) \in R$ implies $(\sigma(n),f(x)) \in R$.

[L1] Induction holds in $N$: any $S \subseteq N$ with $0 \in S$ that is closed under $\sigma$ equals $N$ (axiom P3, [[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L2] In a Peano system $\sigma(n) \ne 0$ (P1) and $\sigma$ is injective (P2) ([[def-peano-system]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The set $N \times A$ is closed, so the collection of closed subsets of $N \times A$ is nonempty; let $g := \bigcap \{ R : R \subseteq N \times A \text{ closed} \}$, which is itself closed, since if every closed $R$ contains $(0,a)$ then so does $g$, and if $(n,x) \in g$ then $(n,x) \in R$ for each closed $R$, whence $(\sigma(n),f(x)) \in R$ for each such $R$, so $(\sigma(n),f(x)) \in g$. [given, construct]

2.1 Let $D = \{ n \in N : \exists x \in A,\ (n,x) \in g \}$; then $0 \in D$ since $(0,a) \in g$, and if $n \in D$ with $(n,x) \in g$ then $(\sigma(n),f(x)) \in g$ by closure, so $\sigma(n) \in D$; by induction $D = N$, hence $g$ relates every $n$ to at least one $x$. [L1, step 1.1]

2.2 Suppose $(0,b) \in g$ with $b \ne a$; then $g \setminus \{(0,b)\}$ still contains $(0,a)$ and is closed, since any generated pair $(\sigma(m),f(z))$ has $\sigma(m) \ne 0$ by P1 and so is never equal to $(0,b)$; this contradicts the minimality of $g$, so $a$ is the unique second coordinate paired with $0$. [L2, step 1.1]

3.1 Let $U = \{ n \in N : \text{there is exactly one } x \text{ with } (n,x) \in g \}$; then $0 \in U$ by step 2.2. [step 2.2]

4.1 Assume $n \in U$ with unique value $x$, so $(n,x) \in g$ and $(\sigma(n),f(x)) \in g$ by closure; if $(\sigma(n),c) \in g$ with $c \ne f(x)$, then $g \setminus \{(\sigma(n),c)\}$ contains $(0,a)$ because $\sigma(n) \ne 0$, and is closed, because a generated pair $(\sigma(m),f(z))$ with $(m,z) \in g \setminus \{(\sigma(n),c)\}$ can equal $(\sigma(n),c)$ only if $\sigma(m) = \sigma(n)$ and $f(z) = c$, but $\sigma(m) = \sigma(n)$ forces $m = n$ by injectivity, then $z = x$ by uniqueness at $n$, giving $f(z) = f(x) \ne c$, a contradiction; hence $g \setminus \{(\sigma(n),c)\}$ is closed and smaller than $g$, contradicting minimality, so $f(x)$ is the unique value at $\sigma(n)$ and $\sigma(n) \in U$. [L2, step 3.1, step 1.1]

5.1 By induction $U = N$, so together with the totality from step 2.1 the relation $g$ is a function $g : N \to A$; it satisfies $g(0) = a$, and closure with uniqueness gives $g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n))$ for all $n$. [L1, step 2.1, step 3.1, step 4.1]

6.1 If $h : N \to A$ also satisfies $h(0) = a$ and $h(\sigma(n)) = f(h(n))$, then the set $\{ n : g(n) = h(n) \}$ contains $0$ and is closed under $\sigma$, since $g(n) = h(n)$ implies $g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n)) = f(h(n)) = h(\sigma(n))$, so by induction it equals $N$, that is $h = g$. [L1, step 5.1] ∎

## Statement

Every nonempty subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ has a least element: there is $\ell \in S$ with $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A nonempty subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. Define $T = \{\, n \in \mathbb{N} : \text{every } m \text{ with } m \le n \text{ satisfies } m \notin S \,\}$ (informally, no element of $S$ is $\le n$).

[L1] Induction principle: a subset of $\mathbb{N}$ that contains $0$ and is closed under $\sigma$ equals $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L2] $m < n \iff \sigma(m) \le n$; consequently no $k$ satisfies $n < k < \sigma(n)$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]).

[L3] Exactly one of $s < n$, $s = n$, $n < s$ holds ([[lem-nat-trichotomy]]); and $n < s \iff \sigma(n) \le s$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]).

[L4] $\sigma$ is injective (Peano axiom P2) ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]).

[L5] $\sigma(a) + i = \sigma(a + i)$ for all $a, i$ (the left successor law, [[lem-nat-add-successor-left]]).

[L6] $0 + k = k$ for all $k$ ([[lem-nat-add-identity]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose $S$ is nonempty but has no least element. [assume-contra]

1.2 If $m < \sigma(n)$ then $m \le n$: by [L2] applied to $m$ and $\sigma(n)$ we get $\sigma(m) \le \sigma(n)$, say $\sigma(m) + i = \sigma(n)$; then $\sigma(m + i) = \sigma(m) + i = \sigma(n)$ [L5], so $m + i = n$ by injectivity [L4], hence $m \le n$. [L2, L4, L5]

2.1 First, $0 \in T$: if $0 \in S$ then $0 \le s$ for all $s \in S$, since $0 + s = s$ [L6], making $0$ a least element, contrary to the assumption; hence $0 \notin S$; moreover $m \le 0$ forces $m = 0$, because $m \ne 0$ would give $0 < m$ (as $0 + m = m$ [L6] with $m \ne 0$) while $m \le 0$ gives $m < 0$, and [L3] admits at most one of these; so every $m \le 0$ lies outside $S$. [step 1.1, L3, L6, given]

2.2 Next, $T$ is closed under $\sigma$: assume $n \in T$; if $\sigma(n) \in S$ then no $s \in S$ satisfies $s < \sigma(n)$ (else $s \le n$ by step 1.2, so $s \notin S$ because $n \in T$, a contradiction), hence $\sigma(n) \le s$ for all $s \in S$ by [L3], making $\sigma(n)$ a least element, contrary to the assumption; therefore $\sigma(n) \notin S$, and any $m$ with $m \le \sigma(n)$ satisfies $m = \sigma(n)$ or $m \ne \sigma(n)$; in the second case $m \le \sigma(n)$ together with $m \ne \sigma(n)$ gives $m < \sigma(n)$ by the definition of the strict order, hence $m \le n$ by step 1.2 and $m \notin S$ because $n \in T$, while in the first case $m = \sigma(n) \notin S$; so every $m \le \sigma(n)$ lies outside $S$, giving $\sigma(n) \in T$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L3]

3.1 By the induction principle [L1], from $0 \in T$ and closure under $\sigma$, $T = \mathbb{N}$; then for every $n$, taking $m = n \le n$ shows $n \notin S$, so $S = \varnothing$, contradicting nonemptiness; therefore $S$ has a least element. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L1, discharge-contradiction] ∎
