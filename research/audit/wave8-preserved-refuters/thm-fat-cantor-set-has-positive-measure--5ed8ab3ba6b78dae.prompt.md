You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as a
read-only adversarial proof-refuter for the published-page audit. You are
tool-less: you cannot open a file, run a command, browse, edit, or delegate.
Everything you may rely on is reproduced in the `This dispatch` section. Return
evidence only; Audit-Alpha alone adjudicates and edits.

## Triage — the standing rule (verbatim, binding on you)

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct
  citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

## Adversarial standard

Read the target's title, Statement/Definition/Example/Statement refuted, Facts &
Assumptions, every numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks.
Try to falsify the public claim and every load-bearing inference.

1. Compare every cited fact with the supplied source text before alleging that
   it is weak. Check domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, direction, conclusion,
   and whether the source licenses the exact use.
2. Check that the title and public statement assert no more than the proof
   establishes, and that every proof step uses only available premises.
3. Check both directions of biconditionals, uniqueness/existence claims,
   induction and limiting arguments, empty/zero/endpoint/degenerate cases,
   extended-real conventions, index shifts, and hidden division or choice.
4. Re-read Remarks as skeptically as a numbered step. A false mathematical
   remark is a defect even when the proof is sound.
5. When the target is marked `ai-generated`, actively search for a
   counterexample to its claim, witness, or refutation rather than merely
   checking prose consistency.
6. Treat a false public claim, logically invalid proof, missing necessary
   hypothesis, circularity, or materially inaccurate load-bearing citation as
   fatal. Do not inflate an expository omission or a gap closable within thirty
   seconds into a defect.

## Statement

Let $S$ be the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set ([[def-fat-cantor-set]]). Then:

1. $S$ is closed and bounded, hence compact
   ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]]);
2. $S$ is perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]);
3. $S$ is nowhere dense ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]]);
4. if $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ are sequences of reals with $a_k \le b_k$,
   $S \subseteq \bigcup_k [a_k,b_k]$ and $\sum_{k<i}(b_k - a_k) \le M$ for every
   $i \in \mathbb{N}$, then $M \ge 2^{-1}$.

In particular $S$ does **not** have measure zero
([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]): no cover of $S$ by intervals has total
length below $2^{-1}$, let alone below every positive $\varepsilon$.

**Claim 4 is the quantitative form**, and it is what claim 4 of the title asserts
in the only vocabulary available here. This library defines no outer measure, so
"the measure of $S$ is $1/2$" is not a statement it can make; what it can state,
and what is proved below, is that $2^{-1}$ is a lower bound for the total length
of every interval cover of $S$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The lengths $(\lambda_n)$, the gaps $g_n = \lambda_n - \lambda_{n+1}$, the finite lists $(N_n, \ell^{(n)})$ with entries $e^{(n)}_j$, and the sets $S_n$, $S$ of [[def-fat-cantor-set]]. For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $j < N_n$ write $M^{(n)}_j := \big(e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_{n+1},\ e^{(n)}_j + g_n\big)$ for the open interval removed from the $j$-th piece at stage $n$.

[A1] The negation of claim 4: sequences $(a_k)$, $(b_k)$ with $a_k \le b_k$, $S \subseteq \bigcup_k [a_k,b_k]$, all partial sums $\sum_{k<i}(b_k - a_k) \le M$, and $M < 2^{-1}$.

[L1] The construction: $N_0 = 1$, $e^{(0)}_0 = 0$, $\lambda_0 = 1$, $N_{n+1} = N_n + N_n$, $e^{(n+1)}_j = e^{(n)}_j$ for $j < N_n$ and $e^{(n+1)}_{N_n + j} = e^{(n)}_j + g_n$ for $j < N_n$; $S_n = \bigcup_{j<N_n}[e^{(n)}_j, e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n]$; $S = \bigcap_n S_n \subseteq S_m \subseteq [0,1]$; $0 < \lambda_{n+1} < g_n < \lambda_n \le 2^{-n}$; $g_n + \lambda_{n+1} = \lambda_n$; $\lambda_n - 2\lambda_{n+1} = 4^{-n-1}$; and $\sum_{j<N_n} c = 2^{n}c$ for every real $c$ ([[def-fat-cantor-set]], [[def-interval]], [[def-integer-power]], [[lem-power-laws]]).

[L2] $[c,d]$ is a closed set, $(c,d)$ is open, $N_\varepsilon(x) = (x-\varepsilon,x+\varepsilon)$, a closed bounded interval is bounded, finite unions of closed sets are closed and an intersection of a nonempty family of closed sets is closed ([[def-interval]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-bounded-set]], [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]).

[L3] A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is compact exactly when it is closed and bounded ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L4] Perfect means closed with no isolated point; nowhere dense means the interior of the closure is empty, and a closed set equals its closure ([[def-perfect-set-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-nowhere-dense-meager]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]]).

[L5] If $[u,v] \subseteq \bigcup_k [c_k,d_k]$ with $u \le v$, $c_k \le d_k$ and $\sum_{k<i}(d_k - c_k) \le M'$ for every $i$, then $M' \ge v - u$ ([[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]]).

[L6] There is a bijection $J : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-n-cross-n-countable]], [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L7] Finite sums: splitting, scaling, monotonicity in the terms; a finite sum of nonnegative terms indexed injectively inside a finite rectangle is at most the sum over the rectangle ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L8] $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} 2^{-n} = 2$, every partial sum of a nonnegative series is at most its sum, and $2^{-n} \to 0$ ([[thm-geometric-series]], [[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]], [[def-series]], [[lem-geometric-sequence-null]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L9] Induction on $\mathbb{N}$; every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element; every finite list of naturals has an upper bound in $\mathbb{N}$, the order of $\mathbb{N}$ being total ([[thm-induction-principle]], [[thm-well-ordering-principle]], [[lem-nat-trichotomy]], [[def-nat-order]]).

[L10] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 > 0$ and $4 > 0$ and $2^{-1} > 0$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve an inequality; the order is total and transitive ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that claim 4 fails, and fix $(a_k)$, $(b_k)$ and $M$ as in [A1], so that $M < 2^{-1}$. [assume-contra, given, A1, choose]

1.2 **$S$ is compact, claim 1.** Each $S_n$ is the union of the finite list of closed sets $[e^{(n)}_j, e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n]$, $j < N_n$, hence closed by [L2]; so $S = \bigcap_n S_n$ is closed by [L2], and $S \subseteq [0,1]$ is bounded by [L1] and [L2]; by [L3] it is compact. [L1, L2, L3]

1.3 **Separation.** For every $n$ and all $i \ne j$ below $N_n$ one has $|e^{(n)}_i - e^{(n)}_j| > \lambda_n$, by induction on $n$ ([L9]). At $n = 0$ there is nothing to prove, since $N_0 = 1$. Assume it at $n$ and let $i \ne j$ below $N_{n+1} = N_n + N_n$. If both indices are $< N_n$, or both are $\ge N_n$, the two entries are $e^{(n)}_{i'}$ and $e^{(n)}_{j'}$ with $i' \ne j'$, possibly both shifted by the same $g_n$, so the difference has absolute value $> \lambda_n > \lambda_{n+1}$ by [L1]. Otherwise the entries are $e^{(n)}_{i'}$ and $e^{(n)}_{j'} + g_n$; if $i' = j'$ the difference is $g_n > \lambda_{n+1}$ by [L1]; if $e^{(n)}_{i'} - e^{(n)}_{j'} > \lambda_n$ then $e^{(n)}_{i'} - e^{(n)}_{j'} - g_n > \lambda_n - g_n = \lambda_{n+1}$, and if $e^{(n)}_{j'} - e^{(n)}_{i'} > \lambda_n$ then $e^{(n)}_{j'} + g_n - e^{(n)}_{i'} > \lambda_n > \lambda_{n+1}$, in each case by [L1] and [L10]. Consequently the pieces $[e^{(n)}_j, e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n]$, $j < N_n$, are pairwise disjoint. [L1, L9, L10]

1.4 **Every endpoint lies in $S$.** Fix $n$ and $j < N_n$. For $m \le n$ one has $e^{(n)}_j$ and $e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n$ in $S_n \subseteq S_m$ by [L1]. For $m \ge n$, an induction on $m$ ([L9]) gives indices $j', j'' < N_m$ with $e^{(m)}_{j'} = e^{(n)}_j$ and $e^{(m)}_{j''} + \lambda_m = e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n$: at $m = n$ take $j' = j'' = j$; and if they exist at $m$, then $e^{(m+1)}_{j'} = e^{(m)}_{j'}$ works for the left endpoint, while $e^{(m+1)}_{N_m + j''} + \lambda_{m+1} = e^{(m)}_{j''} + g_m + \lambda_{m+1} = e^{(m)}_{j''} + \lambda_m$ works for the right one, by [L1]. So both points lie in every $S_m$, hence in $S$. [L1, L9]

1.5 **The complement decomposes over the stages.** $[0,1] \setminus S = \bigcup_{n}(S_n \setminus S_{n+1})$. The inclusion $\supseteq$ holds because $S_n \subseteq S_0 = [0,1]$ and $S \subseteq S_{n+1}$ by [L1]. For $\subseteq$, let $x \in [0,1] \setminus S$; then $x \in S_0$ and, $S$ being $\bigcap_m S_m$, the set of $m$ with $x \notin S_m$ is nonempty, so by [L9] it has a least element $m_0$, and $m_0 \ge 1$ since $x \in S_0$. Put $n := m_0 - 1$; then $x \in S_n$ by minimality and $x \notin S_{n+1}$. [L1, L9]

2.1 **The removed pieces.** Fix $n$ and $j < N_n$. By [L1] the pieces $[e^{(n)}_j, e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_{n+1}]$ and $[e^{(n)}_j + g_n,\ e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n]$ both occur among the pieces of $S_{n+1}$, so a point $x$ of $[e^{(n)}_j, e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n]$ outside $S_{n+1}$ satisfies $\lambda_{n+1} < x - e^{(n)}_j < g_n$, that is $x \in M^{(n)}_j$; hence $S_n \setminus S_{n+1} \subseteq \bigcup_{j<N_n} M^{(n)}_j$. Conversely $M^{(n)}_j \cap S_{n+1} = \varnothing$: a piece of $S_{n+1}$ coming from $i \ne j$ lies in $[e^{(n)}_i, e^{(n)}_i + \lambda_n]$, which is disjoint from $[e^{(n)}_j, e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n] \supseteq M^{(n)}_j$ by step 1.3, while the two pieces coming from $j$ itself are disjoint from the open interval $M^{(n)}_j$ by [L10]. Finally each $M^{(n)}_j$ has length $g_n - \lambda_{n+1} = \lambda_n - 2\lambda_{n+1} = 4^{-n-1}$, so $\sum_{j<N_n} 4^{-n-1} = 2^{n} \cdot 4^{-n-1} = 4^{-1} \cdot 2^{-n}$ by [L1]. [step 1.3, L1, L10]

2.2 **$S$ is perfect, claim 2.** $S$ is closed by step 1.2. Let $x \in S$ and let the real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given; by [L1] and [L8] fix $n$ with $\lambda_n \le 2^{-n} < \varepsilon$. Since $x \in S_n$ there is $j < N_n$ with $x \in [e^{(n)}_j, e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n]$; the two endpoints of that piece lie in $S$ by step 1.4, are distinct because $\lambda_n > 0$, and each is within $\lambda_n < \varepsilon$ of $x$ by [L10]. So at least one of them is a point of $S \cap N_\varepsilon(x)$ different from $x$, and $x$ is not isolated in $S$; by [L4], $S$ is perfect. [step 1.2, step 1.4, L1, L4, L8, L10]

3.1 **$S$ is nowhere dense, claim 3.** $S$ is closed by step 1.2, so it equals its closure, and by [L4] it suffices that its interior be empty. Suppose $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq S$ for some $x$ and some real $\varepsilon > 0$; fix $n$ with $\lambda_n \le 2^{-n} < \varepsilon$ by [L1] and [L8], and $j < N_n$ with $x \in [e^{(n)}_j, e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n]$. The point $w := e^{(n)}_j + (\lambda_{n+1} + g_n) \cdot 2^{-1}$ lies in $M^{(n)}_j$, since $\lambda_{n+1} < g_n$, and hence in $[e^{(n)}_j, e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n]$, so $|w - x| \le \lambda_n < \varepsilon$ and $w \in N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq S \subseteq S_{n+1}$; but $M^{(n)}_j \cap S_{n+1} = \varnothing$ by step 2.1, which is impossible. So no neighbourhood is contained in $S$ and $S$ is nowhere dense. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L1, L4, L8, L10]

3.2 **A cover of $[0,1]$ built from [A1] and the removed pieces.** By [L6] fix a bijection $J$ and define sequences $(c_i)$, $(d_i)$ as follows: for $i \in \mathbb{N}$ write $(m, t) := J^{-1}(i)$; if $m = 0$ put $(c_i, d_i) := (a_t, b_t)$; if $m \ge 1$ and $t < N_{m-1}$ put $(c_i,d_i) := \big(e^{(m-1)}_t + \lambda_{m}, \ e^{(m-1)}_t + g_{m-1}\big)$; and otherwise put $(c_i,d_i) := (0,0)$. Then $c_i \le d_i$ for every $i$ by [L1], and $\bigcup_i [c_i,d_i]$ contains $S$ by [A1] and contains $[0,1] \setminus S$ by steps 1.5 and 2.1, hence contains $[0,1]$. For a partial sum, fix $i_0$; the pairs $J^{-1}(i)$ with $i < i_0$ are distinct, so by [L9] there is $P$ bounding both of their coordinates, and since all the terms are nonnegative [L7] gives $\sum_{i<i_0}(d_i - c_i) \le \sum_{t \le P}(b_t - a_t) + \sum_{n \le P}\sum_{t < N_n} 4^{-n-1} \le M + \sum_{n\le P} 4^{-1}2^{-n} \le M + 4^{-1} \cdot 2 = M + 2^{-1}$, using [A1], step 2.1, [L7] and [L8]. [step 1.1, step 1.5, step 2.1, A1, L1, L6, L7, L8, L9]

4.1 By [L5] applied to $[0,1]$ and the cover of step 3.2, $M + 2^{-1} \ge 1 - 0 = 1$, so $M \ge 2^{-1}$, contradicting step 1.1. Claim 4 therefore holds; and $S$ is not null, since nullity would give, at $\varepsilon := 4^{-1}$, a cover of $S$ with all partial total lengths $\le 4^{-1} < 2^{-1}$, which claim 4 forbids. With steps 1.2, 2.2 and 3.1 all four claims are proved. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.2, step 3.1, step 3.2, L5, L10, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Nowhere dense and null are independent.** $S$ is nowhere dense and not null;
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is null and not nowhere dense ([[lem-countable-sets-are-null]],
  [[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]). The two false statements recording this are
  [[fs-nowhere-dense-implies-measure-zero]] and
  [[fs-measure-zero-implies-nowhere-dense]], with witnesses
  [[cex-nowhere-dense-with-positive-measure]] and
  [[cex-dense-set-of-measure-zero]].

- **Where the construction differs from the Cantor set, and where it does not.**
  Steps 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.2 and 3.1 use only that the pieces shrink to $0$ in
  length, double in number and stay separated, which the middle-thirds
  construction also satisfies; so $S$ and $C$ are indistinguishable at that level.
  The difference is entirely in step 2.1: the removed length at stage $n$ is
  $4^{-1}2^{-n}$ here and $2^{n}3^{-n-1}$ there, and only the first is summable to
  less than $1$. The removed lengths are added up in
  [[ex-fat-cantor-measure-computed]], where they total exactly $2^{-1}$.

- **Compactness is not what is used against nullity.** The proof of claim 4 never
  extracts a finite subcover: it combines the given countable cover of $S$ with
  the countably many removed pieces and appeals to
  [[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]], whose own proof is where the
  compactness of $[0,1]$ is spent. Passing through
  [[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]] would work too and would be longer.

## Statement refuted

**Refuted claim:** every subset of $\mathbb{R}$ of measure zero is nowhere dense
([[fs-measure-zero-implies-nowhere-dense]]).

The witness is $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, the set of rationals inside
$\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]). It is at most countable, hence null
([[lem-countable-sets-are-null]]), and it is dense, so its closure is
$\mathbb{R}$ and the interior of that closure is $\mathbb{R}$, as far from empty
as possible. The refutation is carried out in full in
[[fs-measure-zero-implies-nowhere-dense]]; this item records the witness and the
explicit cover.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The set $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ of rationals.

[A1] The refuted claim: every subset of $\mathbb{R}$ of measure zero is nowhere dense.

[L1] $\mathbb{Q}$ is countably infinite, so $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is at most countable and therefore null ([[thm-rationals-countable]], [[def-countable]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]], [[lem-countable-sets-are-null]], [[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

[L2] $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is dense: $\overline{\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}} = \mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]).

[L3] Nowhere dense means the interior of the closure is empty; $\mathbb{R}$ is open, so its interior is itself ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ has measure zero, by [L1]. [L1]

1.2 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is not nowhere dense: its closure is $\mathbb{R}$ by [L2] and the interior of $\mathbb{R}$ is $\mathbb{R}$ by [L3], which is not empty. [L2, L3]

2.1 So $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ witnesses the failure of [A1]. [step 1.1, step 1.2, A1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The cover is explicit and startling.** For every $\varepsilon > 0$ the rationals are covered by open intervals of total length exactly $\varepsilon$ ([[ex-q-covered-by-intervals-of-small-total-length]]), although their union is dense because it contains $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$.

- **$\mathbb{Q}$ is small in the other sense too, one level up.** It is meager, being a countable union of singletons ([[cor-q-is-meager-and-not-g-delta]]); what fails is only nowhere density itself. So the counterexample separates "nowhere dense" from "meager", not category from measure.

- **The complementary witness** is the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set, nowhere dense and not null ([[cex-nowhere-dense-with-positive-measure]]).

## Statement refuted

**Refuted claim:** every nowhere dense subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has measure zero
([[fs-nowhere-dense-implies-measure-zero]]).

The witness is the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set $S$ ([[def-fat-cantor-set]]): the
subset of $[0,1]$ obtained by removing, at stage $n$, an open interval of length
$4^{-n-1}$ from the middle of each of the $2^{n}$ intervals then present. It is
nowhere dense ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]]) and no cover of it by intervals has
total length below $2^{-1}$, so it is not of measure zero
([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]). This item records the witness and says
what makes it work; the refutation is carried out in full in
[[fs-nowhere-dense-implies-measure-zero]] and
[[thm-fat-cantor-set-has-positive-measure]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The Smith-Volterra-Cantor set $S$ of [[def-fat-cantor-set]].

[A1] The refuted claim: every nowhere dense subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has measure zero.

[L1] $S$ is compact, perfect and nowhere dense, and any bound $M$ on the partial total lengths of a cover of $S$ by intervals satisfies $M \ge 2^{-1}$ ([[thm-fat-cantor-set-has-positive-measure]], claims 1 to 4).

[L2] A set is null when for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ it admits a cover by a sequence of closed intervals with all partial total lengths at most $\varepsilon$ ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $S$ is a nowhere dense subset of $\mathbb{R}$, by claim 3 of [L1]. [L1]

1.2 $S$ is not null: a cover witnessing nullity at $\varepsilon := 4^{-1}$ would give $4^{-1} \ge 2^{-1}$ by claim 4 of [L1] and [L2], which is false. [L1, L2]

2.1 So $S$ witnesses the failure of [A1]. [step 1.1, step 1.2, A1] ∎

## Remarks

- **What makes it work is a change of proportion, not of shape.** The
  middle-thirds construction removes a fixed *fraction* of each piece and loses
  total length $1$; this one removes a fixed *length* $4^{-n-1}$ at stage $n$ and
  loses only $2^{-1}$ ([[ex-fat-cantor-measure-computed]]). Topologically the two
  sets are indistinguishable at the level of the properties proved here: both are
  compact, perfect and nowhere dense ([[thm-cantor-set-properties]]).

- **The complementary witness.** For the reverse implication the witness is
  $\mathbb{Q}$, which is null and not nowhere dense
  ([[cex-dense-set-of-measure-zero]]). The two counterexamples together show the
  two smallness notions are independent.

## Statement

In any ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, the multiplicative identity
satisfies $0 < 1$; that is, $1 \in P$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$ and multiplicative identity $1$ ([[def-field]]).

[L1] In any field $1 \neq 0$ ([[def-field]]).

[L2] For every $x \neq 0$ the square satisfies $x^2 > 0$ ([[lem-of-square-positive]]).

[L3] The identity axiom gives $1 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1^2$ ([[def-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By the field axioms $1 \neq 0$, and $1 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1^2$. [L1, L3]

2.1 Since $1 \neq 0$, applying the square lemma with $x = 1$ gives $1^2 > 0$. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 Because $1 = 1^2$, it follows that $1 > 0$, i.e. $0 < 1$. [step 2.1, step 1.1, L3] ∎

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ denotes the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a subset of it.

The notions **upper bound** and **bounded above** are already fixed by
[[def-complete-ordered-field]] and are only recalled here, never redefined:
$u \in \mathbb{R}$ is an *upper bound* of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$, and
$S$ is *bounded above* if it has at least one upper bound. The dual notions are:

- $\ell \in \mathbb{R}$ is a **lower bound** of $S$ if $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.
- $S$ is **bounded below** if it has at least one lower bound.
- $S$ is **bounded** if it is both bounded above and bounded below, that is, if
  there are $\ell, u \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\ell \le s \le u$ for every $s \in S$.

## Remarks

- A bound is an element of $\mathbb{R}$ and is not required to lie in $S$. A
  bound that does lie in $S$ is a maximum or a minimum ([[def-max-min]]), and
  that is a strictly stronger condition ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Bounds come in half-lines: if $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$ then so is every
  $\ell'' \le \ell$, and if $u$ is an upper bound then so is every $u'' \ge u$.
  Consequently a set that has one bound of a given kind has infinitely many, and
  the interesting question is whether the collection of them has a best element,
  which is what a supremum ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) or an infimum
  ([[def-infimum]]) is.
- Bounded above and bounded below are independent conditions. The set
  $A = \{\, n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} : n \ge 1 \,\}$ of canonical naturals of
  $\mathbb{R}$ is bounded below by $0$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]) and is not
  bounded above ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); its reflection $-A$ is bounded above
  and not bounded below ([[lem-reflection]]).
- The empty set is bounded, and vacuously so: every real number is both an upper
  bound and a lower bound of $\emptyset$, since the defining condition quantifies
  over no elements. Having bounds is therefore much weaker than having a least
  upper bound or a greatest lower bound ([[fs-every-set-has-sup]]).

## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq F$.

- $u \in F$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$; $S$ is
  **bounded above** if it has an upper bound.
- $u \in F$ is a **least upper bound** (or **supremum**, $\sup S$) of $S$ if $u$
  is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le u'$ for every upper bound $u'$ of $S$.

$F$ is a **complete ordered field** (equivalently, $F$ has the
**least-upper-bound property**, or is **Dedekind complete**) if every nonempty
$S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$.

## Remarks

- A least upper bound, if it exists, is unique (two least upper bounds are each
  $\le$ the other, so equal by antisymmetry of the order).
- Applying the property to $\{-s : s \in S\}$ yields the dual **greatest lower
  bound** (infimum) property, so the two are equivalent.
- The Dedekind-cut reals have this property by construction
  ([[thm-dedekind-complete]]); the Cauchy-sequence reals acquire it via
  [[cor-cauchy-reals-lub-complete]]. This definition is the target for the
  uniqueness theorem [[thm-uniqueness-complete-ordered-field]].

## Definition

**The lengths.** By the recursion theorem in the index-carrying form used by
[[def-finite-sum]] ([[thm-recursion]], applied to $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$
with starting element $(0,1)$ and the map
$(n,t) \mapsto (n+1,\, (t - 4^{-n-1}) \cdot 2^{-1})$) there is a unique sequence
$(\lambda_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of reals with

$$\lambda_0 = 1, \qquad \lambda_{n+1} = (\lambda_n - 4^{-n-1}) \cdot 2^{-1} \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}),$$

powers being those of [[def-integer-power]]. Put $g_n := \lambda_n - \lambda_{n+1}$.

**The left endpoints.** Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the set of pairs $(N, \ell)$ with
$N \in \mathbb{N}$, $N \ge 1$, and $\ell$ a function from
$\{\, j \in \mathbb{N} : j < N \,\}$ to $\mathbb{R}$; such a pair is a *finite
list of reals of length $N$*. Applying [[thm-recursion]] to
$\mathbb{N} \times \mathcal{F}$, the starting element $(0, (1, \ell^{(0)}))$ with
$\ell^{(0)}_0 := 0$, and the map that sends $(n, (N,\ell))$ to
$(n+1, (N + N, \ell'))$ where

$$\ell'_j := \ell_j \ \ (j < N), \qquad \ell'_j := \ell_{j - N} + g_n \ \ (N \le j < N + N),$$

gives a unique family $(N_n, \ell^{(n)})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of finite lists,
with $N_0 = 1$, $N_{n+1} = N_n + N_n$, and $\ell^{(n+1)}$ the concatenation of
$\ell^{(n)}$ with its translate by $g_n$. Write $e^{(n)}_j := \ell^{(n)}_j$.

**The sets.** For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ put

$$S_n \;:=\; \bigcup_{j < N_n} \big[\, e^{(n)}_j,\ e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n \,\big], \qquad S \;:=\; \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} S_n ,$$

the intervals being those of [[def-interval]]. $S$ is the
**Smith-Volterra-Cantor set**, also called the *fat Cantor set*.

**Counting.** For every $n$ and every real $c$ one has
$\sum_{j < N_n} c = 2^{n} c$, by induction on $n$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]):
at $n = 0$ both sides are $c$; and $\sum_{j<N_n + N_n} c = \sum_{j<N_n} c +
\sum_{j<N_n} c = 2^{n}c + 2^{n}c = 2^{n+1}c$, by the splitting law
([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[def-finite-sum]]) and
$2^{n+1} = 2^{n} \cdot 2 = 2^{n} + 2^{n}$ ([[def-integer-power]],
[[def-ordered-field]]). So stage $n$ has "$2^n$ intervals" in exactly this sense,
and no separate arithmetic of natural-number exponents is needed.

**The lengths are positive and shrink.** By induction on $n$:
$0 < \lambda_{n+1} \le \lambda_n \cdot 2^{-1}$ and $2^{n}\lambda_n \ge 2^{-1}$.
Indeed $2^{n+1}\lambda_{n+1} = 2^{n}(\lambda_n - 4^{-n-1}) = 2^{n}\lambda_n -
4^{-1} \cdot 2^{-n}$ by [[lem-power-laws]], so by induction
$2^{n}\lambda_n = 1 - 4^{-1}\sum_{i<n} 2^{-i} \ge 1 - 4^{-1} \cdot 2 = 2^{-1}$,
using $\sum_{i<n}2^{-i} \le \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} 2^{-i} = 2$
([[thm-geometric-series]], [[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]],
[[def-series]]). Hence $\lambda_n \ge 2^{-n-1} > 0$; and
$\lambda_{n+1} = (\lambda_n - 4^{-n-1})\cdot 2^{-1} \le \lambda_n \cdot 2^{-1}$
gives $\lambda_n \le 2^{-n}$ by a second induction, so the lengths tend to $0$.

**Each stage removes an open middle interval of length $4^{-n-1}$.** From the
recursion, the two sub-intervals of $[e,\, e + \lambda_n]$ retained at stage
$n+1$ are $[e,\, e + \lambda_{n+1}]$ and $[e + g_n,\, e + g_n + \lambda_{n+1}] =
[e + g_n,\, e + \lambda_n]$, so what is dropped from that piece is the open
interval

$$M \;=\; \big(\, e + \lambda_{n+1},\ e + g_n \,\big), \qquad \text{of length } \ g_n - \lambda_{n+1} \;=\; \lambda_n - 2\lambda_{n+1} \;=\; 4^{-n-1} .$$

In particular $\lambda_{n+1} < g_n$, so $M$ is nonempty, and $g_n > 0$, so
$[e + g_n, e + \lambda_n] \subseteq [e, e+\lambda_n]$. Counting from $1$ as in
the title: at stage $n \ge 1$ an open interval of length $4^{-n}$ is removed from
each of the $2^{n-1}$ intervals then present.

**The family is nested and lies in $[0,1]$.** Each retained sub-interval is
contained in the piece it came from, by the previous paragraph, so
$S_{n+1} \subseteq S_n$; and $S_0 = [0, 1]$ since $N_0 = 1$, $e^{(0)}_0 = 0$ and
$\lambda_0 = 1$. Hence $S \subseteq S_m \subseteq [0,1]$ for every $m$.

## Remarks

- **What is different from [[def-cantor-set]].** There the removed middle is a
  fixed *proportion* of each piece, so the construction is self-similar and the
  total removed length is $1$. Here the removed middle has a fixed *length*
  $4^{-n-1}$, chosen to shrink faster than the pieces multiply, and the total
  removed length is only $2^{-1}$. Everything topological survives the change:
  the set is still compact, perfect and nowhere dense
  ([[thm-fat-cantor-set-has-positive-measure]]). Everything metric fails: $S$ is
  not of measure zero.

- **Why the construction is written with explicit lists.** The set $S_n$ is a
  union of $2^n$ intervals, and both the estimate of the removed length and the
  finite covers used later need those intervals as a *list*, indexed by naturals
  below $N_n$. Building the list by recursion, rather than asserting its
  existence at each stage, is also what keeps the construction free of any
  choice: $(N_n, \ell^{(n)})$ is a single function of $n$.

- **The name.** The set was described by Smith in 1875, by Volterra in 1881 and
  by Cantor in 1883; "fat Cantor set" is the informal name, and the two names are
  used interchangeably below.

- **$0$ and $1$ belong to $S$.** Both are instances of the general fact that
  every $e^{(n)}_j$ and every $e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n$ lies in $S$, proved where it
  is used, in [[thm-fat-cantor-set-has-positive-measure]]: take $n = 0$ and
  $j = 0$, where $e^{(0)}_0 = 0$ and $e^{(0)}_0 + \lambda_0 = 1$.

## Definition

Throughout this page $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), in particular an ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]]) and a field ([[def-field]]), and $\mathbb{N}$ is the set
of natural numbers ([[def-natural-numbers]]) with successor $\sigma(n) = n + 1$
([[def-nat-addition]]).

Let $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a sequence of reals, written $a_k$ for
$a(k)$. **Finite sums and finite products of $a$ are defined by recursion on the
upper index**, which is legitimate because of the recursion theorem
([[thm-recursion]]). That theorem produces a function of one variable, so the
running index has to be carried along inside the value: applying it to the set
$A = \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$, the starting element $(0, 0)$ and the function
$f(n, s) = (\sigma(n),\, s + a_n)$ gives a unique
$g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$ with

$$g(0) = (0, 0), \qquad g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n)) \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Write $g(n) = \big(\pi_1(g(n)),\, \Sigma_n\big)$ for its two coordinates.

**The first coordinate is the index itself, and that is a small induction, not an
observation** ([[thm-induction-principle]]). Indeed $\pi_1(g(0)) = 0$; and if
$\pi_1(g(n)) = n$, then
$g(\sigma(n)) = f\big(\pi_1(g(n)), \Sigma_n\big) = \big(\sigma(\pi_1(g(n))),\, \Sigma_n + a_{\pi_1(g(n))}\big) = \big(\sigma(n),\, \Sigma_n + a_n\big)$,
so $\pi_1(g(\sigma(n))) = \sigma(n)$. By induction $\pi_1(g(n)) = n$ for every
$n \in \mathbb{N}$. Only now may the second coordinate of the two displayed
clauses be read off, and doing so gives

$$\Sigma_0 = 0, \qquad \Sigma_{\sigma(n)} = \Sigma_n + a_n .$$

$\Sigma$ is moreover the **unique** function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with those
two properties: if $\Sigma'$ also has them then $n \mapsto (n, \Sigma'_n)$ satisfies
the two clauses defining $g$, hence equals $g$ by the uniqueness clause of
[[thm-recursion]], so $\Sigma' = \Sigma$.

We write $\sum_{k < n} a_k := \Sigma_n$. The same construction with starting
element $(0, 1)$ and $f(n, p) = (\sigma(n),\, p \cdot a_n)$, with the same
induction on the first coordinate and the same uniqueness argument, gives the
unique $\Pi : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with

$$\Pi_0 = 1, \qquad \Pi_{\sigma(n)} = \Pi_n \cdot a_n ,$$

and we write $\prod_{k < n} a_k := \Pi_n$.

**Notation.** For $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ we abbreviate

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \sum_{k < n+1} a_k, \qquad \prod_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \prod_{k < n+1} a_k,$$

and, for a general lower index $m$ with $m \le n + 1$, writing $d = n + 1 - m$
for the number of terms,

$$\sum_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \sum_{j < d} a_{m+j}, \qquad \prod_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \prod_{j < d} a_{m+j} .$$

When $m = n + 1$ we have $d = 0$ and the sum is **empty**, with value $0$, while
the empty product has value $1$. In the same spirit $\sum_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ is
notation for the empty sum $\Sigma_0 = 0$ and $\prod_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ for the
empty product $\Pi_0 = 1$; the index $-1$ never occurs as an element of
$\mathbb{N}$ and is only a way of writing "no terms".

Only finitely many values of $a$ enter $\sum_{k<n} a_k$, so the notation
$\sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\prod_{k<n} a_k$ is also used for a list
$a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$ of reals given without reference to any extension of the
list to all of $\mathbb{N}$: extend the list by $a_k = 0$ (respectively
$a_k = 1$) for $k \ge n$ and apply the definition above.

## Remarks

- **Why recursion and not "$a_0 + a_1 + \cdots + a_{n-1}$".** The dots are not a
  definition: they presuppose that the displayed pattern determines a value for
  every $n$, which is exactly what the recursion theorem
  ([[thm-recursion]]) supplies, and its uniqueness clause is what makes
  $\sum_{k<n} a_k$ a single well-determined real rather than a family of choices.
  Associativity and commutativity of addition are *not* used in the definition;
  they are used in the laws proved from it ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).
- **Naturals and rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$ (a convention used on the whole
  page).** A natural number $n$ and a rational number $r$ are not literally
  elements of $\mathbb{R}$: they enter $\mathbb{R}$ through the canonical
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$, which is an injective,
  order-preserving field homomorphism ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), restricting on
  positive naturals to $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} = 1_\mathbb{R} + \cdots + 1_\mathbb{R}$
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). Following ordinary practice, and only where no
  confusion is possible, we write $n$ for $\iota(n)$ and $r$ for $\iota(r)$; so,
  for instance, $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k<n} a_k$ means
  $\iota(n)^{-1} \cdot \sum_{k<n} a_k$, which makes sense because
  $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$. Exponents are the one place where the
  identification is deliberately NOT made: in $a^n$ and $a^r$ the exponent stays
  a natural, an integer or a rational ([[def-integer-power]],
  [[def-rational-power]]), never a real.
- The two indexings are related by $\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k = \sum_{k < n+1} a_k$, so
  a statement proved for one is available for the other. Sums over $k < n$ are
  the primitive form here because $\Sigma_0$, the empty sum, is then the base
  case of every induction, and no index outside $\mathbb{N}$ is ever needed.

## Definition

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets and let $f : A \to B$ be a function ([[def-function]]).

- $f$ is **injective** (one-to-one) if $f(x) = f(y)$ implies $x = y$, for all
  $x, y \in A$.
- $f$ is **surjective** (onto) if for every $b \in B$ there is some $x \in A$
  with $f(x) = b$; equivalently, the image $f[A] := \{ f(x) : x \in A \}$ equals
  $B$.
- $f$ is **bijective** if it is both injective and surjective.

For $S \subseteq A$ we write $f[S] = \{ f(x) : x \in S \}$ for the image of $S$,
and for $T \subseteq B$ we write $f^{-1}[T] = \{ x \in A : f(x) \in T \}$ for the
preimage of $T$; these are the image and preimage of a set under $f$ read as a
relation ([[def-image-and-preimage-under-a-relation]]).

## Remarks

- **Composition.** If $f : A \to B$ and $g : B \to C$ are both injective then so
  is $g \circ f$, since $g(f(x)) = g(f(y))$ forces $f(x) = f(y)$ and then
  $x = y$; if both are surjective then so is $g \circ f$, since any $c \in C$ is
  $g(b)$ for some $b \in B$ and that $b$ is $f(a)$ for some $a \in A$. Hence a
  composition of bijections is a bijection. These verifications, together with the
  two partial converses, are
  [[prop-composition-preserves-injectivity-surjectivity-and-bijectivity]].

- **Inverses.** $f : A \to B$ is bijective exactly when there is a function
  $f^{-1} : B \to A$ with $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ for all $x \in A$ and
  $f(f^{-1}(b)) = b$ for all $b \in B$; that two-sided inverse is unique, and it
  is itself a bijection. Injectivity alone gives a bijection from $A$ onto the
  image $f[A]$, and hence an inverse defined on $f[A]$ only. No choice principle
  is involved: the value $f^{-1}(b)$ is the *unique* $x$ with $f(x) = b$, so it
  is determined rather than selected. The full statement, with the uniqueness of the
  two-sided inverse, is
  [[thm-a-function-is-a-bijection-exactly-when-it-has-a-two-sided-inverse]]; the
  corresponding statement for an arbitrary surjection is not available at this point
  in the reading order, because a right inverse for every surjection is equivalent
  to the Axiom of Choice.

- **What this item does and does not do.** A function $A \to B$ is a set of ordered
  pairs, single valued and total on $A$ ([[def-function]]); ordered pairs, Cartesian
  products, images and preimages are fixed by [[def-ordered-pair]],
  [[def-cartesian-product]] and [[def-image-and-preimage-under-a-relation]]. This
  item only fixes the three adjectives and the notation used for them. Nothing here
  is proved.

## Definition

Let $a \in \mathbb{R}$, where $\mathbb{R}$ is the ambient ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]).

**Natural exponents.** By the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) applied to
the set $\mathbb{R}$, the starting element $1$ and the function
$f(x) = x \cdot a$, there is a unique function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$,
written $n \mapsto a^n$, with

$$a^0 = 1, \qquad a^{n+1} = a^n \cdot a \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Thus $a^1 = a$, $a^2 = a \cdot a$, and so on. Note that this is defined for
**every** $a$, including $a = 0$.

**Negative exponents.** If $a \ne 0$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, set

$$a^{-n} := (a^n)^{-1}.$$

**Why that is legitimate.** The right-hand side presupposes that $a^n$ is
invertible, that is, that $a^n \ne 0$. This is a proof obligation and not an
observation, and it is discharged by claim 2 of [[lem-power-laws]]: for $a \ne 0$
in a field, $a^n \ne 0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, proved there by induction on
$n$ from the fact that a field has no zero divisors ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]).
That lemma is a statement *about* the operation introduced here, so it depends on
this definition and is recorded in this item's `justified_by` rather than in its
`deps` (SCHEMA §3). Given $a^n \ne 0$, the value $(a^n)^{-1}$ is a single
well-determined element, because multiplicative inverses in a field are unique
([[lem-of-inverse-unique]]).

**Integer exponents.** Every integer $m$ ([[def-integers]]) is either
$\iota(n)$ or $-\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$, where $\iota$ is the
embedding $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]],
[[def-int-operations]]). This too is a citation and not a slogan: the order on
$\mathbb{Z}$ is total ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), so $m \ge 0$ or $m < 0$; the
image of $\iota$ is exactly the set of nonnegative integers, and each of them is
$\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]); and if $m < 0$ then
$-m > 0$, by compatibility of the order with addition ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]),
so $-m = \iota(n)$ and $m = -\iota(n)$, with $n$ unique because $\iota$ is
injective. The two clauses above therefore define $a^m$ for every
$m \in \mathbb{Z}$ whenever $a \ne 0$, and for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$ for
arbitrary $a$. The clauses are consistent where they overlap: the only overlap is
$m = 0$, where $-\iota(0) = \iota(0)$ and $(a^0)^{-1} = 1^{-1} = 1 = a^0$.

## Remarks

- **The convention $0^0 = 1$ is adopted here**, and it is not a matter of taste
  but of agreement with the recursion above: $a^0 = 1$ is the starting value for
  every $a$, exactly as the empty product is $1$ ([[def-finite-sum]]). This is
  the convention that makes the empty product, the binomial theorem, and
  polynomial notation $\sum_k c_k x^k$ work at $x = 0$ without an exception. The
  competing convention "$0^0$ undefined" belongs to contexts where $x^y$ is
  studied as a function of two *real* variables and one wants continuity, which
  is unavailable and irrelevant here: the exponent in $a^m$ is an integer, never
  a real.
- $0^n = 0$ for every $n \ge 1$, since $0^{n} = 0^{n-1} \cdot 0 = 0$, a product
  with a zero factor ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]); and
  $0^{-n}$ is not defined for $n \ge 1$, since $0$ has no inverse.
- The exponent is an integer and stays an integer. Rational exponents are a
  separate construction resting on the existence of roots
  ([[thm-nth-roots-exist]], [[def-rational-power]]), and real exponents do not
  exist in this library yet ([[rem-real-exponents-deferred]]).
- The laws $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$ are
  proved, not assumed, in [[lem-power-laws]]; the order behaviour of $a \mapsto a^n$
  is [[lem-power-monotone]].

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with open and closed sets as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

- The **interior** of $A$ is the union of all open subsets of $A$:
  $$A^{\circ} \;:=\; \bigcup \{\, U \subseteq \mathbb{R} : U \text{ open and } U \subseteq A \,\}.$$
- The **closure** of $A$ is the intersection of all closed supersets of $A$:
  $$\overline{A} \;:=\; \bigcap \{\, F \subseteq \mathbb{R} : F \text{ closed and } A \subseteq F \,\}.$$
- The **boundary** of $A$ is $\partial A := \overline{A} \setminus A^{\circ}$.
- The **exterior** of $A$ is $\operatorname{ext} A := (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)^{\circ}$.

**Both operators are well defined and deliver what their names claim.** The
family whose union defines $A^{\circ}$ always contains $\varnothing$, and the
family whose intersection defines $\overline{A}$ always contains $\mathbb{R}$,
so the second family is nonempty and both expressions denote subsets of
$\mathbb{R}$ without appeal to any convention about empty unions or
intersections. Moreover:

- $A^{\circ}$ is **open**, being a union of open sets
  ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], claim 1), and $A^{\circ} \subseteq A$, since
  every set in the family is a subset of $A$. It is therefore the **largest**
  open subset of $A$: any open $U \subseteq A$ is a member of the family and so
  $U \subseteq A^{\circ}$.
- $\overline{A}$ is **closed**, being an intersection of a nonempty family of
  closed sets ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], claim 3), and $A \subseteq
  \overline{A}$, since every set in the family contains $A$. It is therefore the
  **smallest** closed superset of $A$: any closed $F \supseteq A$ is a member of
  the family and so $\overline{A} \subseteq F$.

**Pointwise description of the interior.** For $x \in \mathbb{R}$,

$$x \in A^{\circ} \iff \text{there is } \varepsilon > 0 \text{ with } N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A .$$

If $x \in A^{\circ}$ then, $A^{\circ}$ being open and containing $x$, there is
$\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A^{\circ} \subseteq A$.
Conversely if $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A$ then $N_\varepsilon(x)$ is an open
subset of $A$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) containing $x$, hence
$x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A^{\circ}$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

The corresponding pointwise description of the closure is not a definitional
matter and is proved separately, as [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

## Remarks

- **The four sets partition nothing by themselves, but three of them do.** For
  every $A$ the three sets $A^{\circ}$, $\partial A$ and $\operatorname{ext} A$
  are pairwise disjoint with union $\mathbb{R}$. This is not proved here and is
  not used on this page; what is used is only the definitions above and the
  characterisations of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

- **Interior and closure are dual.** Complementation exchanges the two families
  above, since $U$ is open exactly when $\mathbb{R} \setminus U$ is closed, so
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus A^{\circ} = \overline{\mathbb{R} \setminus A}$ and
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A} = (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)^{\circ} =
  \operatorname{ext} A$. The second identity is the reason the exterior is
  usually described as "the complement of the closure".

- **$A$ is open exactly when $A = A^{\circ}$, and closed exactly when
  $A = \overline{A}$.** For the first: $A^{\circ} \subseteq A$ always, and
  $A \subseteq A^{\circ}$ holds exactly when $A$ is one of the open subsets of
  $A$, that is, exactly when $A$ is open. The closure half is the same argument
  read the other way, and it is recorded as a claim of
  [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] because the rest of that theorem needs it.

- **Boundary points may or may not belong to the set.** $\partial (0,1) =
  \partial [0,1] = \{0,1\}$, and the two boundary points lie outside the first
  set and inside the second; the boundary sees only the way the set meets its
  complement, not which side the edge is assigned to.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]] and closure as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]].

- $x$ is an **adherent point** of $A$ when $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne
  \varnothing$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$.
- $x$ is a **limit point** (or *accumulation point*) of $A$ when
  $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every real
  $\varepsilon > 0$: every punctured neighbourhood of $x$ meets $A$.
- $x$ is an **isolated point** of $A$ when $x \in A$ and there is a real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$.
- The **derived set** of $A$ is
  $$A' \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \text{ is a limit point of } A \,\}.$$
- $A$ is **dense in $\mathbb{R}$** when $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$.

**A limit point is an adherent point**, since $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq
N_\varepsilon(x)$; and an element of $A$ is an adherent point of $A$, since
$x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). So the adherent
points of $A$ are exactly the points of $A \cup A'$, a statement proved as part
of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

**Limit point and isolated point are exact opposites inside $A$.** For
$x \in A$: $x$ is an isolated point of $A$ exactly when it is not a limit point
of $A$. Indeed $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$ says precisely that
$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, because $x$ itself always lies in
$N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ when $x \in A$; so the existence of an $\varepsilon$
witnessing isolation is the negation of the condition defining a limit point.
A point of $A$ is therefore either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$, and
never both.

**A limit point need not belong to the set, and a point of the set need not be a
limit point.** Both possibilities occur, and the two examples that matter later
are $0$, which is a limit point of $\{\, 1/k : k \ge 1 \,\}$ without belonging
to it, and $0$ again, which belongs to $\{0\} \cup [1,2]$ as an isolated point.

## Remarks

- **Terminology: *limit point* here is about a set, never about a sequence.**
  This library reserves *subsequential limit* for the sequential notion
  ([[def-subsequential-limit]]), and the two are genuinely different: the
  constant sequence $x_k = 0$ has $0$ as a subsequential limit, while its set of
  values $\{0\}$ has no limit point at all. The distinction is the one
  [[def-subsequential-limit]] records under "Terminology", and it is respected
  throughout this page.

- **Density is defined through the closure, not through intervals.** Saying
  $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$ is equivalent to saying that every nonempty open
  subset of $\mathbb{R}$ meets $A$, and also to saying that every neighbourhood
  of every real meets $A$; the equivalences follow from
  [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] and are used in that form in
  [[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]].

- **The derived set need not be comparable with the set.** It can be strictly
  larger, as for $\mathbb{Q}$: every punctured neighbourhood of any real
  contains a rational, since density supplies one strictly between $x$ and
  $x + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]), so the derived set of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is all of $\mathbb{R}$. It can be strictly smaller, as for
  $\{0\}$, whose derived set is empty; and it can be neither, as for
  $\{0\} \cup (1,2)$, whose derived set is $[1,2]$, a set containing points
  outside the original and omitting the point $0$ of it. A closed set satisfying
  $A \subseteq A'$ is called perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]).

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), intervals and their lengths are as in
[[def-interval]], and a *sequence* is a function on $\mathbb{N}$, which contains
$0$. Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

- $A$ has **measure zero**, equivalently $A$ is **null**, when for every real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ there are sequences $(a_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ and
  $(b_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of reals with $a_k \le b_k$ for every $k$, such
  that
  $$A \subseteq \bigcup_{k \in \mathbb{N}} [a_k, b_k] \qquad \text{and} \qquad \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (b_k - a_k) \text{ converges with sum } \le \varepsilon .$$
- $A$ has **content zero** when for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there are
  $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and reals $a_0 \le b_0, \dots, a_n \le b_n$ with
  $$A \subseteq \bigcup_{j \le n} [a_j, b_j] \qquad \text{and} \qquad \sum_{j=0}^{n} (b_j - a_j) \le \varepsilon .$$

The number $b_k - a_k \ge 0$ is the length of $[a_k,b_k]$ ([[def-interval]]), and
the sums are the series and the finite sums of [[def-series]] and
[[def-finite-sum]].

**Working form: only the partial sums have to be checked.** All the terms
$b_k - a_k$ are $\ge 0$, so by claim 2 of
[[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]] the series converges exactly when
its partial sums are bounded above, and its sum is then their supremum.
Consequently, for a fixed $\varepsilon > 0$,

$$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(b_k - a_k) \text{ converges with sum} \le \varepsilon \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \sum_{k<n} (b_k - a_k) \le \varepsilon \ \text{ for every } n \in \mathbb{N},$$

since a supremum is $\le \varepsilon$ exactly when $\varepsilon$ is an upper
bound of the set it is the supremum of ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]). Every
verification of nullity below checks the right-hand condition.

**Closed intervals lose nothing.** A bounded interval with endpoints
$a \le b$ is contained in $[a,b]$ and has the same length ([[def-interval]]), so
a cover by intervals of any of the four bounded forms yields a cover by closed
intervals with the same lengths. The definition is therefore stated with closed
intervals once and for all. Covers by *open* intervals are a genuinely different
demand, and passing to one costs a little extra length: the enlargement
$[a_k,b_k] \subseteq (a_k - \delta_k,\ b_k + \delta_k)$ is carried out where it is
needed, in [[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]] and in
[[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]].

**Both notions are inherited by subsets.** If $B \subseteq A$ and $A$ is null,
then any cover of $A$ covers $B$, so $B$ is null; the same sentence with finite
covers shows a subset of a set of content zero has content zero.

**A finite cover is a countable cover, so content zero implies measure zero.**
Padding the list $[a_0,b_0], \dots, [a_n,b_n]$ with the degenerate intervals
$[0,0]$ for $k > n$ leaves the total length unchanged, by the splitting law for
finite sums ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]). This is recorded as a lemma with its
proof, [[lem-content-zero-implies-null]], because it is cited on its own.

## Remarks

- **The two notions genuinely differ.** $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$ is null and does
  not have content zero ([[cex-null-set-not-of-content-zero]]), so the two
  quantifier patterns, "a sequence of intervals" and "a finite list of
  intervals", are not interchangeable. They do agree for compact sets
  ([[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]]), and the compact case is the only one in
  which content zero is used anywhere on this pair of pages. Nothing is claimed
  about what later pages will do with it.

- **Why "content" and not "measure" for the finite version.** The finite-cover
  notion is the vanishing of the Jordan outer content, and the countable-cover
  notion is the vanishing of the Lebesgue outer measure. Neither outer quantity
  is defined in this library, and no item here assigns a nonzero size to any set:
  every statement is of the shape "can, or cannot, be covered by intervals of
  total length below such and such a bound". That is a deliberate restriction of
  scope at this point in the reading order, not a claim that the general notions
  are unavailable in mathematics.

- **Measure zero is not vacuous and not universal.** No interval with two
  distinct endpoints is null ([[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]]), while
  every at most countable set is ([[lem-countable-sets-are-null]]) and so is the
  uncountable Cantor set ([[thm-cantor-set-properties]]). The three facts
  together are what make the notion worth having.

## Definition

For $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, define the **order** by

$$m \le n \iff \exists k \in \mathbb{N}\ (m + k = n),$$

and the **strict order** by $m < n \iff (m \le n \text{ and } m \neq n)$, using
addition ([[def-nat-addition]]).

## Remarks

Read $m \le n$ as "$n$ is $m$ plus something": the gap $k$ with $m + k = n$ is
unique when it exists (by commutativity and cancellation,
[[lem-nat-add-commutative]], [[lem-nat-add-cancellative]]) and is
written $n - m$ once subtraction is available. That $\le$ is genuinely a linear
order, reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive, and total, is proved in
[[thm-nat-linear-order]] and [[lem-nat-trichotomy]]; compatibility with the
arithmetic ([[lem-nat-order-add-compatible]],
[[lem-nat-order-mult-compatible]]) and discreteness
($m < n \iff \sigma(m) \le n$, [[lem-nat-discrete]]) follow.

In the von Neumann model this order coincides with membership and inclusion:
$m \le n \iff m \subseteq n$ and $m < n \iff m \in n$, matching the picture of
each natural number as the set $\{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ of its predecessors
([[def-natural-numbers]]). That coincidence is not proved here; it is derived
from the additive definition above on a later page. The least-element property of every nonempty subset,
the **well-ordering principle** ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]), is the deepest
consequence.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]) and its absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]).

Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ with
$\varepsilon > 0$. The **$\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\},$$

and the **punctured $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \;=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}.$$

The two descriptions of $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ agree because $|y - x| = 0$ holds
exactly when $y = x$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**A neighbourhood is an open interval.** For every $x$ and every
$\varepsilon > 0$,

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;=\; (x - \varepsilon,\ x + \varepsilon),$$

the interval of [[def-interval]]. Indeed [[lem-of-abs-value]] gives, for
$\varepsilon > 0$, the equivalence $|y - x| < \varepsilon \iff -\varepsilon <
y - x < \varepsilon$, and adding $x$ throughout turns the right-hand side into
$x - \varepsilon < y < x + \varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**The centre lies in its own neighbourhoods.** $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, since
$|x - x| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**Punctured neighbourhoods are never empty.** The element
$y := x + \varepsilon/2$ satisfies $|y - x| = \varepsilon/2$, which is
$> 0$ and $< \varepsilon$, so $y \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$
([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

**Monotonicity in the radius.** If $0 < \delta \le \varepsilon$ then
$N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, because $|y - x| < \delta \le
\varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**Nesting at an interior point.** If $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and
$0 < \delta \le \varepsilon - |y - x|$, then

$$N_\delta(y) \;\subseteq\; N_\varepsilon(x).$$

Indeed for $z \in N_\delta(y)$ the triangle inequality
([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]) gives
$|z - x| = |(z - y) + (y - x)| \le |z - y| + |y - x| < \delta + |y - x| \le
\varepsilon$. Note that $\varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ precisely because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, so such a $\delta$ always exists.

## Remarks

- **The radius is a real number, not a rational.** Nothing on this page tests a
  condition against rational radii only. That convention belongs to
  [[def-real-limit]], where the quantifier is over rational $\varepsilon$ and
  the passage between the rational and the real form is the sanctioned remark of
  [[def-sequence]]. Here $\varepsilon$ ranges over the positive reals
  throughout, and every statement above is proved for an arbitrary positive
  real.

- **Why the punctured version is separated out.** A limit point of a set is a
  point every punctured neighbourhood of which meets the set
  ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and deleting the centre is exactly what stops a point
  of the set from qualifying automatically. The unpunctured condition defines
  the weaker notion of an adherent point, and the difference between the two is
  precisely an isolated point.

- **Nesting is the workhorse.** Almost every openness verification on this page
  has the shape "given $y$ in the set, shrink the radius by the distance
  already travelled", which is the nesting property above. It is recorded here
  once so that no later proof has to redo the triangle inequality in passing.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with interior $A^{\circ}$ and closure
$\overline{A}$ as in [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]].

- $A$ is **nowhere dense** when the interior of its closure is empty:
  $$\big(\overline{A}\big)^{\circ} \;=\; \varnothing .$$
- $A$ is **meager**, or **of the first category**, when there is a sequence
  $(A_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of nowhere dense subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ with
  $$A \;=\; \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n .$$
- $A$ is **of the second category** when it is not meager.
- $A$ is **residual** (also *comeager*) when $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ is meager.

**Why a sequence, and why that is the same as "an at most countable union".**
Sequences here are indexed by $\mathbb{N}$, which contains $0$. A finite family
$A_0, \dots, A_m$ of nowhere dense sets is turned into a sequence by setting
$A_n := \varnothing$ for $n > m$, and $\varnothing$ is nowhere dense because
$\overline{\varnothing} = \varnothing$ has empty interior; the empty family is
handled the same way and gives $A = \varnothing$. So "a union of an at most
countable family of nowhere dense sets" ([[def-countable]]) and the displayed
condition define the same class, and the sequence form is used below because it
carries an explicit index and needs no case split.

**Nowhere dense means exactly that the complement of the closure is dense.**
For $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$,

$$\big(\overline{A}\big)^{\circ} = \varnothing \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A} \text{ is dense in } \mathbb{R} .$$

Indeed, by the pointwise description of the interior
([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]), $(\overline{A})^{\circ} = \varnothing$
says that no $x \in \mathbb{R}$ admits a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with
$N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq \overline{A}$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), that is,
that every $N_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $\mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A}$. By
claim 1 of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] that says precisely that every
$x \in \mathbb{R}$ is adherent to $\mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A}$, that is,
$\overline{\mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A}} = \mathbb{R}$, which is density
([[def-limit-point-r]]).

**A closed set is nowhere dense exactly when its interior is empty**, since a
closed set equals its own closure (claim 4 of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]],
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]). This is the form in which nowhere density is
verified nearly every time below. (The phrase *almost everywhere* is avoided
throughout this pair: it is a measure-theoretic term, and the only measure notion
defined here is measure zero.)

**Both classes are closed downwards.** If $B \subseteq A$ then
$\overline{B} \subseteq \overline{A}$ and hence
$(\overline{B})^{\circ} \subseteq (\overline{A})^{\circ}$
([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]), so a subset of a nowhere dense set is
nowhere dense. If $B \subseteq A = \bigcup_n A_n$ with each $A_n$ nowhere dense,
then $B = \bigcup_n (A_n \cap B)$ and each $A_n \cap B$ is nowhere dense by the
previous sentence, so a subset of a meager set is meager.

**A union of two meager sets is meager.** Let $M = \bigcup_n A_n$ and
$M' = \bigcup_n B_n$ with all $A_n$ and all $B_n$ nowhere dense; fixing one
witnessing sequence for $M$ and one for $M'$ is two instantiations of an
existential statement, not a choice principle. Let
$J : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ be a bijection
([[thm-n-cross-n-countable]]) and define a sequence $(C_j)_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ by

$$C_{J(m,n)} \;:=\; \begin{cases} A_n & m = 0, \\ B_n & m \ne 0. \end{cases}$$

This is a total definition because $J$ is a bijection, every $C_j$ is nowhere
dense, and $\bigcup_j C_j = M \cup M'$, since $A_n = C_{J(0,n)}$ and
$B_n = C_{J(1,n)}$ and every $C_j$ is one of the $A_n$ or one of the $B_n$.

## Remarks

- **The countably infinite version of the last observation is a different
  statement.** To show that $\bigcup_i M_i$ is meager for a sequence $(M_i)$ of
  meager sets one must select a witnessing sequence of nowhere dense sets for
  every $i$ at once, which is an application of countable choice
  ([[def-countable-choice]]); the two-set case above avoids it because two
  selections are two instantiations. Nothing on this page uses the countably
  infinite version, and every meager set met below is presented together with an
  explicit witnessing sequence.

- **Nowhere dense is strictly stronger than having empty interior.**
  $\mathbb{Q}$ has empty interior, since no neighbourhood consists of rationals
  alone, yet $\overline{\mathbb{Q}} = \mathbb{R}$ has interior $\mathbb{R}$, so
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is not nowhere dense. It is nevertheless meager, being a union of
  singletons; that computation is [[cor-q-is-meager-and-not-g-delta]].

- **First category, second category and residual are not a trichotomy.** A set
  is meager or of the second category, and those two are exhaustive and
  exclusive by definition. Residual is a separate condition on the complement: a
  residual set is of the second category once $\mathbb{R}$ is known not to be
  meager in itself ([[thm-baire-category-r]]), but before that theorem nothing
  rules out a set that is both meager and residual.

- **Category is a notion of topological smallness, and it is independent of
  smallness in the sense of measure.** Neither of the two implications between
  "nowhere dense" and "measure zero" ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]])
  holds, and $\mathbb{R}$ itself splits into a meager set and a set of measure
  zero; the three items settling this are
  [[fs-nowhere-dense-implies-measure-zero]],
  [[fs-measure-zero-implies-nowhere-dense]] and
  [[cex-meager-set-of-full-measure]].

## Definition

Let $U, F \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]].

- $U$ is **open** when for every $x \in U$ there is a real $\varepsilon > 0$
  with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$.
- $F$ is **closed** when its complement $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open.
- A set is **clopen** when it is both open and closed.

The whole of the topology of $\mathbb{R}$ developed on this page rests on this
one definition: closedness is *defined* as openness of the complement, and every
other description of a closed set on this page is a theorem
([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]]).

**$\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen.** The condition defining openness
quantifies over the elements of the set, so it holds vacuously for
$\varnothing$; and for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ one has $N_1(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$,
so $\mathbb{R}$ is open. Since each of the two is the complement of the other,
each is also closed.

**Every neighbourhood is open.** Let $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and put
$\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x|$, which is $> 0$ because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$. The nesting property of [[def-neighbourhood-r]] gives
$N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$. So every point of $N_\varepsilon(x)$
has a neighbourhood inside it.

**The four open forms of [[def-interval]] are open sets.** Let $a, b \in
\mathbb{R}$.

- $(a,b)$: for $x$ with $a < x < b$, both $x - a > 0$ and $b - x > 0$, so
  $\delta := \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ is a positive real (the minimum of a
  two-element set of reals exists, [[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).
  If $|y - x| < \delta$ then $y > x - \delta \ge x - (x - a) = a$ and
  $y < x + \delta \le x + (b - x) = b$, so $y \in (a,b)$; hence
  $N_\delta(x) \subseteq (a,b)$.
- $(a,\infty)$: for $x > a$ take $\delta := x - a > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y > x - \delta = a$.
- $(-\infty,b)$: for $x < b$ take $\delta := b - x > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y < x + \delta = b$.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: already treated above.

**The four closed forms of [[def-interval]] are closed sets.** In each case the
complement is shown open directly.

- $[a,b]$: if $x \notin [a,b]$ then $x < a$ or $x > b$ by trichotomy
  ([[def-ordered-field]]). If $x < a$, take $\delta := a - x > 0$; every
  $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has $y < x + \delta = a$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. If
  $x > b$, take $\delta := x - b > 0$; every $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has
  $y > x - \delta = b$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. So
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus [a,b]$ is open.
- $[a,\infty)$: its complement is $(-\infty,a)$, which is open by the previous
  paragraph.
- $(-\infty,b]$: its complement is $(b,\infty)$, which is open.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: its complement is $\varnothing$, which is
  open.

## Remarks

- **Open and closed are not opposites, and not exhaustive.** A set may be
  neither: the half-open interval $[0,1)$ is neither open nor closed
  ([[fs-every-set-is-open-or-closed]]). A set may be both: $\varnothing$ and
  $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen. The words are inherited from the interval terminology
  of [[def-interval]], and the agreement between the two usages is exactly the
  two lists verified above: an interval called open there is an open set here,
  and an interval called closed there is a closed set here.

- **A clopen set is a disconnection waiting to happen.** If $A$ is clopen and
  both $A$ and $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ are nonempty, then each of the two is
  its own closure, so the two are separated in the sense of
  [[def-connected-r]] and $\mathbb{R} = A \cup (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)$ is a
  disconnection. Since $\mathbb{R}$ is order-convex it is connected
  ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]]), so no such $A$ exists:
  $\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are the only clopen subsets of $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The half-open forms are the ones the two lists omit**, and deliberately so:
  $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ with $a < b$ are neither open nor closed as subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The radius depends on the point.** Openness asks for *some* $\varepsilon$
  at each point, and that $\varepsilon$ may shrink to nothing as the point
  approaches the edge of the set, as the computation for $(a,b)$ shows: there
  $\delta = \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ tends to $0$ as $x$ tends to either endpoint.
  Asking instead for a single $\varepsilon$ that works simultaneously at every
  point of the set is a strictly stronger condition, and it is not what is
  defined here; nothing on this page uses it.

## Definition

Let $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with open sets as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

- An **open cover** of $K$ is a family $\mathcal{U}$ of open subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$ with $K \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{U}$.
- A **subcover** of $\mathcal{U}$ is a subfamily $\mathcal{V} \subseteq
  \mathcal{U}$ that is still an open cover of $K$.
- A subfamily $\mathcal{V} \subseteq \mathcal{U}$ is **finite** when
  $\mathcal{V} = \varnothing$ or there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and members
  $U_0, \dots, U_n$ of $\mathcal{U}$ with $\mathcal{V} = \{U_0, \dots, U_n\}$;
  repetitions in the list are allowed and harmless.
- $K$ is **compact** when every open cover of $K$ has a finite subcover:
  for every open cover $\mathcal{U}$ of $K$, either $K = \varnothing$ and the
  empty subfamily covers it, or there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
  $U_0, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{U}$ with
  $$K \subseteq U_0 \cup \dots \cup U_n .$$
- $K$ is **sequentially compact** when every sequence $(x_k)$ of reals with
  $x_k \in K$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-sequence]]) has a subsequence
  converging ([[def-real-limit]]) to some point of $K$; equivalently, when every
  such sequence has a subsequential limit ([[def-subsequential-limit]]) that
  lies in $K$.

**Compactness is a property of $K$ alone.** The covering families range over open
subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, not over sets open in some other ambient space, so the
notion defined here is compactness of $K$ as a subset of $\mathbb{R}$. Nothing
below relativises it to a smaller ambient field; where an ordered field other
than $\mathbb{R}$ is meant, as in
[[fs-closed-bounded-compact-without-completeness]], the whole vocabulary is set
up again there for that field.

**$\varnothing$ is compact and sequentially compact.** The empty subfamily covers
it, and there is no sequence with all terms in $\varnothing$, so both conditions
hold vacuously.

## Remarks

- **Why "finite" is spelled out by listing.** A finite subfamily is described
  here as one that can be written $\{U_0, \dots, U_n\}$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}$,
  which is exactly the form every proof on this page produces or consumes: the
  bisection argument of [[thm-heine-borel-r]] produces a one-member list, and
  the arguments of [[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]] consume a list by
  taking a maximum over it ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]). Since $\mathbb{N}$
  contains $0$, the shortest nonempty list is $\{U_0\}$.

- **The two notions are not defined to be equivalent, and their equivalence is a
  theorem.** For subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ it is
  [[thm-compact-iff-sequentially-compact-r]]; both of its implications run
  through the characterisation of compactness by closed and bounded, and its
  forward implication additionally uses Bolzano-Weierstrass. Neither implication
  is formal.

- **Compactness is not inherited by subsets, but by closed subsets.** A closed
  subset of a compact set is compact, which is immediate from
  [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]] once that is available, whereas
  $(0,1) \subseteq [0,1]$ shows that an arbitrary subset of a compact set need
  not be compact.

- **The empty cover.** If $K \ne \varnothing$ then no open cover of $K$ is
  empty, so the case distinction in the definition of compactness only ever
  matters for $K = \varnothing$; it is written out so that the definition does
  not quietly assume $K$ nonempty.

## Definition

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ ([[def-field]]) together with a subset
$P \subseteq F$, the set of **positive** elements (the *positive cone*),
satisfying:

- **(O1) Trichotomy.** For each $x \in F$, exactly one of the following holds:
  $x \in P$, or $x = 0$, or $-x \in P$.
- **(O2) Closure.** If $x, y \in P$ then $x + y \in P$ and $x \cdot y \in P$.

We write $x > 0$ for $x \in P$ (read "$x$ is positive"), and define the order by

$$a < b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; b - a \in P, \qquad a \le b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; a < b \text{ or } a = b.$$

Thus $a > b$ means $b < a$, and $a \ge b$ means $b \le a$. An element $x$ with
$-x \in P$ (equivalently $x < 0$) is called **negative**.

## Remarks

- By trichotomy applied to $b - a$, for any $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$,
  $a = b$, $a > b$ holds; this makes $\le$ a total order.
- (O2) says the positives are closed under addition and multiplication: sums and
  products of positives are positive.
- The rationals ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and both constructions of the reals
  ([[thm-reals-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-dedekind-ordered-field]]) are ordered
  fields, so every fact proved here from (O1)-(O2) holds in each of them.

## Definition

A set $P \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **perfect** when

- $P$ is closed ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), and
- $P$ has no isolated points ([[def-limit-point-r]]): no $x \in P$ admits a real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap P = \{x\}$.

**Equivalently, $P$ is closed and $P \subseteq P'$.** By
[[def-limit-point-r]], a point of $P$ is isolated in $P$ exactly when it is not
a limit point of $P$, so "no point of $P$ is isolated in $P$" says precisely
that every point of $P$ is a limit point of $P$, that is, $P \subseteq P'$.
Combined with the characterisation of closedness as $P' \subseteq P$
([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]]), a perfect set is exactly a set with
$P = P'$, though only the two conditions above are used below.

## Remarks

- **Both conditions are needed and neither implies the other.** The set
  $\{0\} \cup [1,2]$ is closed and has the isolated point $0$, so it is not
  perfect ([[cex-closed-set-with-an-isolated-point-is-not-perfect]]); the open
  interval $(0,1)$ has no isolated points and is not closed, so it is not
  perfect either.

- **$\varnothing$ is perfect**, vacuously: it is closed and has no points at
  all, hence no isolated ones. This is why
  [[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]] carries the hypothesis that $P$ is nonempty:

## Definition

A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals **converges** to $x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for
every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with
$|x_k - x| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$. It is **Cauchy** when for
every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with
$|x_k - x_l| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$.

## Remarks

- Quantifying over rational $\varepsilon$ loses nothing: below any real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ lies a positive rational ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).
- $|\cdot|$ is the absolute value of [[def-real-order]].

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-real-numbers]]) and
a **sequence of reals** is a function $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$
([[def-sequence]]), written $(a_k)$; recall that $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$.

**Partial sums.** Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals. Its **sequence of partial
sums** is

$$s_n \;:=\; \sum_{k < n} a_k \qquad (n \in \mathbb{N}),$$

the finite sum of [[def-finite-sum]]. In particular $s_0 = 0$, the empty sum, and
$s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ for every $n$, those being exactly the two recursion clauses
that define the finite sum. Note that $s_n$ is the sum of the $n$ terms
$a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$, so the index $n$ counts terms rather than naming the last
one.

**Convergence, the sum, divergence.** The **series** of $(a_k)$, written
$\sum a_k$, **converges** when the sequence $(s_n)$ of partial sums converges
([[def-real-limit]]), and then the **sum of the series** is

$$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k \;:=\; \lim_{n} s_n .$$

The series **diverges** when $(s_n)$ does not converge. A convergent sequence of
reals has exactly one limit ([[lem-limit-unique]]), so the displayed symbol names
a single real number and nothing further has to be checked for it to be
well defined.

**Series with a general starting index.** Let $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $a$ be a
function on $\{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : k \ge m \,\}$, which we call a **family from
$m$** and write $(a_k)_{k \ge m}$. The series

$$\sum_{k \ge m} a_k$$

is by definition the series of the sequence $b_j := a_{j + m}$,
$j \in \mathbb{N}$, which is a genuine sequence of reals; it converges exactly
when that series converges, and its sum is then written
$\sum_{k = m}^{\infty} a_k$. Its partial sums are

$$\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k \;=\; \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j} \qquad (n \ge m),$$

in the notation of [[def-finite-sum]], the value at $n = m$ being the empty sum
$0$. A sequence on $\mathbb{N}$ is the case $m = 0$, and the two readings of
$\sum a_k$ agree there, since $b_j = a_j$.

**This clause is not a convenience.** Sequences in this library are functions on
$\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$ ([[def-sequence]]), while many of the
classical series are built from expressions that are undefined at the index $0$:
$1/k$, $1/k^{p}$ and $|a_k|^{1/k}$ all require $k \ge 1$. Writing such a series as
$\sum_{k \ge 1} a_k$ names an honest object, whereas writing it as a sequence on
$\mathbb{N}$ would require a value at an index where the defining expression has
none. Every statement on this page says which starting index it uses.

**Tail series.** For $N \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$N$-th tail series** of
$\sum a_k$ is $\sum_{k \ge N} a_k$, that is the series of the $N$-th tail
$a^{(N)}$ of [[def-sequence]], whose terms are $a^{(N)}_j = a_{j+N}$. The
$0$-th tail series is the series itself.

## Remarks

- **"Diverges" here means "does not converge", and nothing more.** A divergent
  series may have partial sums that run away to $+\infty$, or to $-\infty$, or
  that oscillate without settling anywhere. The three behaviours are not
  distinguished by the word, and no statement on this page uses "diverges" to
  mean "the partial sums are unbounded" unless it says so.

- **The symbol $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k$ is defined only for a convergent
  series.** It denotes a real number, not a formal object, and it is illegitimate
  to write it down before convergence has been established. Where a proof needs
  to speak of the series without knowing whether it converges, it speaks of
  $(a_k)$ and of $(s_n)$.

- **Two indices, doing different work.** The index $k$ runs over the terms and is
  bound; the index $n$ runs over the partial sums and is the variable in which the
  limit is taken. Confusing them is the commonest slip in the subject, and it is
  the reason the definition above fixes $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ rather than
  $\sum_{k \le n} a_k$: with this choice the recursion $s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ is
  the one supplied by [[def-finite-sum]], with no shift anywhere.

## Example

Let $S$ be the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set ([[def-fat-cantor-set]]). At stage $n$
exactly $2^n$ open intervals, each of length $4^{-n-1}$, are removed, so the
lengths removed at that stage total $2^{n} \cdot 4^{-n-1} = 4^{-1} \cdot 2^{-n}$
and over all stages they total

$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} 4^{-1} \cdot 2^{-n} \;=\; 4^{-1} \cdot 2 \;=\; \tfrac12 .$$

Correspondingly, **no cover of $S$ by intervals has total length below
$\tfrac12$**: if $(a_k)$, $(b_k)$ are sequences of reals with $a_k \le b_k$,
$S \subseteq \bigcup_k [a_k,b_k]$ and $\sum_{k<i}(b_k - a_k) \le M$ for every
$i$, then $M \ge \tfrac12$ ([[thm-fat-cantor-set-has-positive-measure]]).

The two numbers are the two halves of the unit interval's length, and the second
is what "the set has positive measure" means in the vocabulary available here:
this library defines no outer measure, so the assertion is about covers and their
total lengths, never about a number attached to $S$ itself.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The Smith-Volterra-Cantor set $S$, the lengths $(\lambda_n)$, the gaps $g_n$, the lists $(N_n, \ell^{(n)})$ and the removed intervals $M^{(n)}_j = (e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_{n+1},\ e^{(n)}_j + g_n)$ of [[def-fat-cantor-set]].

[L1] Each $M^{(n)}_j$ has length $g_n - \lambda_{n+1} = \lambda_n - 2\lambda_{n+1} = 4^{-n-1}$, and $\sum_{j<N_n} c = 2^{n}c$ for every real $c$ ([[def-fat-cantor-set]], [[def-interval]], [[def-integer-power]], [[lem-power-laws]]).

[L2] $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}2^{-n} = 2$, convergent series scale termwise, and a series of nonnegative terms converges exactly when its partial sums are bounded, the sum being their supremum ([[thm-geometric-series]], [[def-series]], [[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]], [[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L3] If sequences $(a_k)$, $(b_k)$ with $a_k \le b_k$ cover $S$ and all partial total lengths are at most $M$, then $M \ge 2^{-1}$; and $S$ is not null ([[thm-fat-cantor-set-has-positive-measure]], claim 4, [[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

[L4] A finite family of intervals covering $[a,b]$ has total length at least $b-a$, and the same holds for a countable family ([[lem-finite-interval-cover-total-length]], [[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]]).

[L5] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 > 0$ and $4 > 0$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve an inequality ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Verification

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Stage $n$.** By [L1] the intervals removed at stage $n$ are the $M^{(n)}_j$ for $j < N_n$, each of length $4^{-n-1}$, so their lengths total $\sum_{j<N_n} 4^{-n-1} = 2^{n} \cdot 4^{-n-1}$, which equals $4^{-1} \cdot 2^{-n}$ because $4^{-n-1} = 4^{-1} \cdot 4^{-n} = 4^{-1} \cdot 2^{-2n}$ and $2^{n} \cdot 2^{-2n} = 2^{-n}$ by [L1] and [L5]. [given, L1, L5]

2.1 **All stages together.** The terms $4^{-1}2^{-n}$ are nonnegative, and by [L2] the series $\sum_n 4^{-1}2^{-n}$ converges with sum $4^{-1} \cdot 2 = 2^{-1}$. So the total length of all the removed intervals is exactly $2^{-1}$. [step 1.1, L2, L5]

3.1 **The lower bound for covers.** [L3] says precisely that a bound $M$ on all the partial total lengths of a cover of $S$ satisfies $M \ge 2^{-1}$; so no cover of $S$ by intervals, countable or finite, has total length below $2^{-1}$, and in particular $S$ is not null. The two computations fit together: the removed intervals of total length $2^{-1}$ and any cover of $S$ of total length $M$ together cover $[0,1]$, so $M + 2^{-1} \ge 1$ by [L4], which is the same bound. [step 2.1, L3, L4] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the numbers do and do not say.** "Total length of the removed
  intervals" is a sum of lengths of an explicit family, and "no cover below
  $1/2$" is a statement about all covers. Neither says that $S$ *has measure*
  $1/2$: that would require an outer measure, which is not defined at this point
  in the reading order. The pair of statements is nevertheless the exact content
  of the classical assertion.

- **Why $4^{-n}$ and not $3^{-n}$.** For the middle-thirds construction the
  removed length at stage $n$ is $2^{n}3^{-n-1}$, and
  $\sum_n 2^{n}3^{-n-1} = 3^{-1} \cdot 3 = 1$, so everything is removed in the
  sense of total length and the Cantor set is null
  ([[thm-cantor-set-properties]]). Here the removed pieces shrink faster than
  they multiply and only half the length goes.

- **The bound $1/2$ is sharp in one direction only.** The removed intervals
  together with a cover of $S$ must reach total length $1$, so a cover of $S$
  cannot do better than $1/2$; whether total length exactly $1/2$ is approached by
  covers of $S$ is a question about outer measure and is not asked here.

## Statement

**False claim:** every subset of $\mathbb{R}$ of measure zero
([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]) is nowhere dense
([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]]).

The claim confuses two different smallness conditions. Measure zero constrains
the total length of a cover; nowhere density constrains the *closure*. A set may
be covered by intervals of total length below any $\varepsilon$ and still have
every real as an adherent point, and $\mathbb{Q}$ does exactly that.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The set $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ of rationals, that is the image of $\mathbb{Q}$ under the canonical embedding ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[A1] The false claim: every subset of $\mathbb{R}$ of measure zero is nowhere dense.

[L1] $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$, so $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is at most countable ([[thm-rationals-countable]], [[def-countable]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L2] Every at most countable subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has measure zero ([[lem-countable-sets-are-null]]).

[L3] $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$, that is $\overline{\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}} = \mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L4] A set is nowhere dense when the interior of its closure is empty; the interior of an open set is itself, and $\mathbb{R}$ is open ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ has measure zero, being at most countable by [L1] and hence null by [L2]. [L1, L2]

1.2 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is not nowhere dense: its closure is $\mathbb{R}$ by [L3], and the interior of $\mathbb{R}$ is $\mathbb{R}$ itself by [L4], since $\mathbb{R}$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$; so the interior of the closure is $\mathbb{R} \ne \varnothing$. [L3, L4]

2.1 So $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ of measure zero that is not nowhere dense, and the claim [A1] fails at it; the claim is therefore false. [step 1.1, step 1.2, A1] ∎

## Remarks

- **$\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is nonetheless meager**, being a union of countably
  many singletons, each of which *is* nowhere dense
  ([[cor-q-is-meager-and-not-g-delta]]). So the failure above is not a failure of
  topological smallness in every sense: it is exactly the failure of the
  one-step condition. Meagreness is the countable-union closure of nowhere
  density, and it is the notion under which $\mathbb{Q}$ is small.

- **The converse implication is also false**, and needs an uncountable witness:
  the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set is nowhere dense and not null
  ([[fs-nowhere-dense-implies-measure-zero]]).

- **The named witness** is [[cex-dense-set-of-measure-zero]].

## Statement

**False claim:** every nowhere dense subset of $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]]) has measure zero
([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

The claim is tempting because a nowhere dense set is topologically thin: its
closure contains no interval at all, so it is "full of holes" everywhere. The
error is to read that as a statement about total length. Holes may be plentiful
and short at the same time, and the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set is built precisely
so that they are.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The Smith-Volterra-Cantor set $S$ of [[def-fat-cantor-set]].

[A1] The false claim: every nowhere dense subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has measure zero.

[L1] $S$ is nowhere dense ([[thm-fat-cantor-set-has-positive-measure]], claim 3).

[L2] If sequences $(a_k)$, $(b_k)$ with $a_k \le b_k$ cover $S$ and all their partial total lengths are at most $M$, then $M \ge 2^{-1}$; in particular $S$ does not have measure zero ([[thm-fat-cantor-set-has-positive-measure]], claim 4).

[L3] A set is null when for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ it has a cover by a sequence of closed intervals with all partial total lengths at most $\varepsilon$ ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The set $S$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ and is nowhere dense, by [L1]. [L1]

1.2 $S$ does not have measure zero: a cover witnessing nullity at $\varepsilon := 4^{-1}$ would have all partial total lengths at most $4^{-1}$, and [L2] then forces $4^{-1} \ge 2^{-1}$, which is false. [L2, L3]

2.1 So $S$ is a nowhere dense subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that does not have measure zero, and the claim [A1] fails at $S$; the claim is therefore false. [step 1.1, step 1.2, A1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The converse implication is also false**, and for a completely different
  reason: $\mathbb{Q}$ has measure zero and is not nowhere dense
  ([[fs-measure-zero-implies-nowhere-dense]]). So neither of the two notions of
  smallness implies the other, and the two failures are witnessed by sets of
  different cardinality, $S$ being uncountable and $\mathbb{Q}$ countable.

- **What is true.** A nowhere dense set contains no interval of positive length,
  which is a genuine consequence of the definition; and a set of measure zero
  also contains no interval of positive length
  ([[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]]). The two conditions share that
  consequence and nothing beyond it.

- **The named witness** is [[cex-nowhere-dense-with-positive-measure]].

## Statement

Every at most countable set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-countable]]) has
measure zero ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

The cover is explicit: the $k$-th point of a listing of $A$ is put inside an
interval of length $\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-k-1}$, and the lengths sum to
$\varepsilon$ by [[thm-geometric-series]]. **No choice principle is used**: a
listing of $A$ is a single object, fixed once ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]]),
and everything after that is a formula in $k$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An at most countable set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a real $\varepsilon > 0$. Throughout, $\theta := 2^{-1}$.

[L1] $A$ is null when for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there are sequences $(a_k)$, $(b_k)$ with $a_k \le b_k$, $A \subseteq \bigcup_k [a_k,b_k]$, and $\sum_{k<n}(b_k - a_k) \le \varepsilon$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

[L2] $[c,d] = \{\, x : c \le x \le d \,\}$ has length $d - c$ when $c \le d$, and $[c,c] = \{c\}$ has length $0$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L3] A nonempty at most countable set admits a surjection $s : \mathbb{N} \to A$ ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]], [[def-countable]]).

[L4] Powers and the geometric series: $\theta^0 = 1$, $\theta^{k+1} = \theta^k\theta$, $\theta^k > 0$, and $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\theta^k = 2$ for $\theta = 2^{-1}$; a series of nonnegative terms has all its partial sums at most its sum ([[def-integer-power]], [[thm-geometric-series]], [[def-series]], [[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]]).

[L5] Finite sums: scaling by a constant, and $\sum_{k<n} 0 = 0$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L6] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 > 0$, $4 > 0$ and $t \cdot 4^{-1} > 0$ for $t > 0$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve an inequality ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let the real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. If $A = \varnothing$, the constant sequences $a_k := 0$ and $b_k := 0$ satisfy $A \subseteq \bigcup_k [0,0]$ vacuously and $\sum_{k<n}(b_k - a_k) = 0 \le \varepsilon$ for every $n$ by [L5], so the condition of [L1] holds at this $\varepsilon$. Assume from now on that $A \ne \varnothing$ and, by [L3], fix a surjection $s : \mathbb{N} \to A$. [given, L1, L2, L3, L5, choose]

2.1 Put $\delta_k := \varepsilon \cdot 4^{-1} \cdot \theta^{k}$, a positive real by [L4] and [L6], and $a_k := s(k) - \delta_k$, $b_k := s(k) + \delta_k$; then $a_k \le b_k$ and $s(k) \in [a_k,b_k]$ by [L6], so $A = \{\, s(k) : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\} \subseteq \bigcup_k [a_k, b_k]$ by step 1.1. The length of $[a_k,b_k]$ is $b_k - a_k = 2\delta_k = \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} \cdot \theta^{k}$ by [L2] and [L6]. [step 1.1, L2, L4, L6]

3.1 For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $\sum_{k<n}(b_k - a_k) = \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} \sum_{k<n}\theta^{k} \le \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} \cdot 2 = \varepsilon$, using scaling from [L5] and the bound on the partial sums of the geometric series from [L4]. [step 2.1, L4, L5, L6]

4.1 So for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the sequences of step 2.1 cover $A$ with all partial total lengths at most $\varepsilon$, which by [L1] is exactly the statement that $A$ has measure zero; the empty case was settled in step 1.1. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 3.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Indexing.** Sequences here start at $k = 0$, and the first interval has
  length $\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$, not $\varepsilon$. The total is
  $\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} \sum_{k \ge 0} 2^{-k} = \varepsilon$ exactly, so the
  cover is as tight as the definition allows and nothing is wasted at the first
  index.

- **Repetitions are harmless.** A surjection $s$ may repeat values, and a finite
  set is covered by infinitely many intervals, most of them redundant. This is
  why the listing form of countability ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]])
  is the convenient one: no injectivity and no case split between the finite and
  the countably infinite case is needed.

- **The converse fails badly.** The Cantor set is uncountable and null
  ([[thm-cantor-set-properties]]), so "null" is very far from "countable"; and
  the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set is uncountable and not null
  ([[thm-fat-cantor-set-has-positive-measure]]), so cardinality decides nothing
  either way.

- **Density decides nothing either.** $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable, hence null, and
  is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[cex-dense-set-of-measure-zero]]); a null set may
  therefore meet every interval.

## Statement

Let $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be sequences of reals, let
$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, and let $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, with finite sums and
finite products as in [[def-finite-sum]]. Then:

1. **Additivity.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k$.
2. **Scaling.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k$; in particular $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda = n\lambda$, where $n$ denotes the canonical natural $\iota(n) \in \mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).
3. **Splitting.** If $m \le n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k$, and $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n} a_k = \Big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k\Big)$.
4. **Monotonicity.** If $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$. In particular, if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, every single term satisfies $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$ for $j < n$, and $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ forces $a_k = 0$ for every $k < n$.
5. **Telescoping.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}\big(c_{k+1} - c_k\big) = c_n - c_0$.
6. **Products.** $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k) = \Big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\Big)$; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, and if $a_k > 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k > 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\lambda$, and naturals $m, n$. Write $\Sigma_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\Pi_n = \prod_{k<n} a_k$.

[L1] Recursion clauses ([[def-finite-sum]]): $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ and $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n$; $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1$ and $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) \cdot a_n$; and $\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k = \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j}$ for $m \le n$, likewise for products.

[L2] Field axioms: addition and multiplication are associative and commutative, $0$ and $1$ are the identities, $x - x = 0$, and multiplication distributes over addition ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]); and $0 \cdot x = 0$, which is not an axiom but a lemma ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

[L3] Induction principle: a property holding at $0$ and inherited by successors holds at every natural ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L4] Adding inequalities: $x \le y$ and $u \le v$ imply $x + u \le y + v$. [[lem-of-add-order]] states the STRICT forms and only those ($x < y \Rightarrow x + c < y + c$, and $x < y$ with $u < v$ giving $x + u < y + v$); the nonstrict form used throughout below is those two together with the cases $x = y$ and $u = v$, which are settled by trichotomy, the order being total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] The canonical embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a field homomorphism, so $\iota(0) = 0$ and $\iota(n+1) = \iota(n) + 1$, and $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L6] Sign rules: a product of two positives is positive ([[lem-of-sign-rules]], claim 1), and a product of two nonnegatives is nonnegative, since a factor equal to $0$ makes the product $0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]) and otherwise both factors are positive; and $1 > 0$, which is proved in [[cor-of-one-positive]] and stated by none of the items named above.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 0$: every claim holds at $n = 0$, since both sides of claim 1 are $0 = 0 + 0$, both sides of claim 2 are $0 = \lambda \cdot 0$ and $0 = \iota(0)\lambda$, claim 4 reads $0 \le 0$ with no term to bound and the hypothesis $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ giving nothing to prove, claim 5 reads $0 = c_0 - c_0$, and claim 6 reads $1 = 1 \cdot 1$ with $1 > 0$. [base, L1, L2, L5, L6]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for this $n$ and for all sequences $a, b, c$ and all $\lambda$. [ih]

1.3 Splitting, claim 3, by a separate induction on the number of trailing terms $d = n - m$ with $m$ fixed: for $d = 0$ the claim reads $\sum_{k<m} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + 0$ and $\prod_{k<m} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\big) \cdot 1$, which hold; and if $\sum_{k<m+d} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d} a_{m+j}$, then $\sum_{k<m+d+1} a_k = \sum_{k<m+d} a_k + a_{m+d} = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \big(\sum_{j<d} a_{m+j} + a_{m+d}\big) = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d+1} a_{m+j}$ by associativity, and identically for products with $1$ in place of $0$ and multiplication in place of addition, so induction on $d$ gives claim 3 for every $m \le n$. [L1, L2, L3]

2.1 Additivity at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k\big) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) + \big(\sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n\big) = \sum_{k<n+1} a_k + \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$, using the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of addition. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Scaling at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda a_k = \sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda\big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) = \lambda \sum_{k<n+1} a_k$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and distributivity; taking $a_k = 1$ for all $k$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda = \sum_{k<n} \lambda + \lambda = \iota(n)\lambda + \lambda = (\iota(n) + 1)\lambda = \iota(n+1)\lambda$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L5]

2.3 Monotonicity at $n+1$: assume $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n+1$; then $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$, so the hypothesis gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$, and adding the inequality $a_n \le b_n$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n \le \sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n = \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$. [step 1.2, L1, L4]

2.4 Telescoping at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(c_{k+1} - c_k) = \sum_{k<n}(c_{k+1} - c_k) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = (c_n - c_0) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = c_{n+1} - c_0$, by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and the field identities. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.5 Products at $n+1$: $\prod_{k<n+1}(a_k b_k) = \big(\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k)\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n+1} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n+1} b_k\big)$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of multiplication; and if every $a_k \ge 0$ for $k < n+1$ then $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) a_n$ is a product of two nonnegatives, hence nonnegative, with the same argument giving positivity from positivity since $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1 > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L6]

3.1 Consequences of monotonicity, completing claim 4: monotonicity itself holds at every $n$, by the induction principle applied to the base case of step 1.1 and the successor step 2.3, so it is available for an arbitrary $n$ in what follows; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then comparing with the zero sequence gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge \sum_{k<n} 0 = 0$; for $j < n$ splitting at $j$ and then at $j+1$ writes $\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<j} a_k + a_j + \sum_{k=j+1}^{n-1} a_k$ with the first and third summands $\ge 0$, so $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$; and if moreover $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ then $0 \le a_j \le 0$ for every $j < n$, so $a_j = 0$. [step 1.1, step 2.3, step 1.3, L3, L4, L2]

4.1 By the induction principle claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and claim 3 was proved in step 1.3 with its consequences in step 3.1, so all six laws hold. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, step 2.5, step 1.3, step 3.1, L3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $r \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $r^k$ be the integer power ([[def-integer-power]]).

1. If $|r| < 1$ then $(r^k)$ is **null**, that is $r^k \to 0$
   ([[def-real-limit]]).
2. If $|r| > 1$ then $(|r|^k)$ **diverges to $+\infty$**
   ([[def-divergence-to-infinity]]).

Claim 2 is stated for $|r|^k$ and not for $r^k$ on purpose: for $r < -1$ the
terms $r^k$ alternate in sign and are unbounded, so they neither converge nor
diverge to $+\infty$; what is true of them is the statement about their absolute
values.

Both claims come from Bernoulli's inequality ([[lem-bernoulli-inequality]]) and
the Archimedean property. Nothing here needs the least-upper-bound property
except through [[thm-of-archimedean]] and [[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real $r$, with integer powers as in [[def-integer-power]]; for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the symbol $n$ also denotes the canonical natural $n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ where it occurs in an arithmetic expression.

[L1] Absolute value: $|x| \ge 0$; $|x| = 0$ exactly when $x = 0$; $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; and $|x| = x$ when $x \ge 0$, so in particular $|1| = 1$ because $1 > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]], [[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] Induction principle ([[thm-induction-principle]]), and the recursion clauses $a^0 = 1$, $a^{k+1} = a^k a$ defining integer powers ([[def-integer-power]]).

[L3] Bernoulli's inequality: $(1+x)^n \ge 1 + nx$ for $x \ge -1$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[lem-bernoulli-inequality]]).

[L4] Power laws: $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$, and $a^n \ne 0$ when $a \ne 0$ ([[lem-power-laws]]).

[L5] Powers and order: $a \ge 0$ gives $a^n \ge 0$ and $a > 0$ gives $a^n > 0$; $1^n = 1$ for every $n$ ([[lem-power-monotone]]).

[L6] Reciprocals: $a > 0$ gives $a^{-1} > 0$; $0 < a < b$ gives $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]); and $0 < t < 1$ exactly when $1/t > 1$ ([[prop-of-reciprocal-order]]).

[L7] Archimedean property: for every $x \in \mathbb{R}$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $x < n$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); and for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/N < \varepsilon$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]]).

[L8] Canonical naturals: $n > 0$ for $n \ge 1$, and $m \le n$ in $\mathbb{N}$ gives $m \le n$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L9] Multiplying inequalities of nonnegatives: $0 \le a \le b$ and $0 \le c \le d$ give $ac \le bd$ ([[prop-of-multiply-inequalities]]).

[L10] Trichotomy of the order on $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L11] Convergence to $0$ and divergence to $+\infty$ for a sequence of reals; a rational test value $\varepsilon > 0$ is in particular a real one ([[def-real-limit]], [[def-divergence-to-infinity]], [[def-sequence]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 First, $|r^k| = |r|^k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, by induction: at $k = 0$ both sides are $|1| = 1$, and if $|r^k| = |r|^k$ then $|r^{k+1}| = |r^k r| = |r^k|\,|r| = |r|^k |r| = |r|^{k+1}$. [given, L1, L2]

1.2 **Case zero.** Assume $r = 0$. [given, assume-case zero]

1.3 **Case small.** Assume $0 < |r| < 1$. [given, assume-case small]

1.4 **Case large.** Assume $|r| > 1$. [given, assume-case large]

2.1 In case zero, $r^k = 0$ for every $k \ge 1$: indeed $r^1 = r^0 r = 1 \cdot 0 = 0$, and if $r^k = 0$ then $r^{k+1} = r^k r = 0$, so induction gives the claim from $k = 1$ on. [step 1.2, L2]

2.2 In case small, put $s := 1/|r|$, which is defined since $|r| \ne 0$, and $h := s - 1$. Then $s > 1$ and $h > 0$. [step 1.3, L1, L6, choose]

2.3 In case large, put $h' := |r| - 1$, so $h' > 0$ and $|r| = 1 + h'$. [step 1.4, choose]

3.1 In case zero, for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ and every $k \ge 1$ we have $|r^k - 0| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$, so $r^k \to 0$ and claim 1 holds. [step 2.1, L1, L11]

3.2 In case small, $|r|^k s^k = (|r| s)^k = 1^k = 1$, so $|r|^k = 1/s^k$, and $s^k > 0$. [step 2.2, L4, L5]

3.3 In case small, Bernoulli applied to $h > 0 \ge -1$ gives $s^k = (1+h)^k \ge 1 + kh > kh > 0$ for every $k \ge 1$, using $1 > 0$ and $kh > 0$. [step 2.2, L3, L8, L9]

3.4 In case large, Bernoulli applied to $h' > 0 \ge -1$ gives $|r|^k = (1 + h')^k \ge 1 + k h'$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.3, L3]

3.5 In case large, let $M \in \mathbb{R}$ be arbitrary and use [L7] to fix a natural $n \ge 1$ with $M/h' < n$; then $M \le n h'$, since multiplying $M/h' \le n$ by $h' > 0$ preserves the inequality. [step 2.3, L7, L9, choose]

3.6 In case small, let $\varepsilon > 0$ be rational; then $\varepsilon h > 0$, so [L7] supplies a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/N < \varepsilon h$, whence $1/(Nh) \le \varepsilon$ on multiplying by $1/h > 0$. [step 2.2, L6, L7, L9, choose]

4.1 In case small, combining steps 3.2 and 3.3: $0 < kh < s^k$ gives $|r|^k = 1/s^k < 1/(kh)$ for every $k \ge 1$. [step 3.2, step 3.3, L6]

4.2 In case large, for every $k \ge n$ we have $k h' \ge n h' \ge M$, so $|r|^k \ge 1 + k h' \ge 1 + M > M$, the last step because $1 > 0$. [step 3.4, step 3.5, L1, L8, L9]

5.1 In case small, for every $k \ge N$ we have $kh \ge Nh > 0$, hence $1/(kh) \le 1/(Nh) \le \varepsilon$, and therefore $|r^k - 0| = |r^k| = |r|^k < 1/(kh) \le \varepsilon$. [step 1.1, step 4.1, step 3.6, L6, L8, L9]

5.2 In case large, an index $n$ has been produced for an arbitrary real $M$ with $|r|^k > M$ for all $k \ge n$, which is exactly divergence to $+\infty$: claim 2 holds. [step 4.2, L11]

6.1 In case small, the rational $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary and the index $N$ was produced from it, so $r^k \to 0$ and claim 1 holds. [step 5.1, L11]

7.1 The hypothesis $|r| < 1$ of claim 1 is exhausted by cases zero and small, since $|r| \ge 0$ with $|r| = 0$ exactly when $r = 0$, so trichotomy leaves only $0 < |r| < 1$; the hypothesis $|r| > 1$ of claim 2 is case large. Both claims are therefore established. [step 3.1, step 5.2, step 6.1, L1, L10, cases: zero small or large, cases-exhaustive] ∎

## Remarks

- **The two claims are not one claim in disguise.** For $|r| > 1$ the sequence
  $(r^k)$ itself has no limiting behaviour to record when $r$ is negative: its
  terms alternate in sign and grow, so it neither converges nor diverges to
  $+\infty$ nor to $-\infty$. Stating claim 2 for $|r|^k$ is what makes it true
  as written.

- **The boundary $|r| = 1$ is excluded and is genuinely different.** For $r = 1$
  the sequence is constant $1$; for $r = -1$ it is the alternating sequence
  ([[lem-alternating-sequence]]), which is bounded and divergent
  ([[fs-bounded-implies-convergent]]). So neither claim extends to $|r| = 1$, and
  the two cases at the boundary do not even agree with each other.

- **Where this is used.** Claim 1 supplies the null sequence $c^{k}$ that makes a
  contractive sequence Cauchy ([[thm-contractive-implies-cauchy]]) and the null
  sequence $(1/10)^n$ that identifies the limit of the decimal truncations of
  $\sqrt 2$ ([[cex-cauchy-rationals-no-rational-limit]]).

## Statement

For all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ exactly one of $m < n$, $m = n$, $m > n$ holds. In particular the order ([[def-nat-order]]) is total.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The order on $\mathbb{N}$, where $m \le n$ means $\exists k\ (m + k = n)$ and $m < n$ means $m \le n$ with $m \ne n$ ([[def-nat-order]]), and addition with $m + 0 = m$, $m + \sigma(n) = \sigma(m + n)$ ([[def-nat-addition]]).

[L1] $0 + k = k$ ([[lem-nat-add-identity]]).

[L2] Left successor law: $\sigma(a) + k = \sigma(a + k)$ ([[lem-nat-add-successor-left]]).

[L3] Addition is associative ([[lem-nat-add-associative]]).

[L4] Every nonzero natural is a successor: $n \ne 0 \Rightarrow n = \sigma(a)$ for some $a$ ([[lem-nat-nonzero-is-successor]]).

[L5] $\sigma(x) \ne 0$ for every $x$ (axiom P1 of [[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]).

[L6] Cancellation: $x + k = y + k \Rightarrow x = y$ ([[lem-nat-add-cancellative]]).

[L7] Addition is commutative ([[lem-nat-add-commutative]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 At most one of the three holds where equality is involved: $m < n$ forces $m \ne n$ and $m > n$ forces $n \ne m$, so $m = n$ is incompatible with either strict relation. [given]

1.2 The two strict relations are incompatible: if $m < n$ and $m > n$ then $m + j = n$ and $n + i = m$ with $i, j \ne 0$, so $m + (j + i) = (m + j) + i = n + i = m = m + 0$; by commutativity [L7], $(j + i) + m = 0 + m$, so $j + i = 0$ by cancellation [L6]; yet $j = \sigma(a)$ [L4] gives, by the left successor law [L2], $j + i = \sigma(a) + i = \sigma(a + i) \ne 0$ [L5], a contradiction. [given, L2, L3, L4, L5, L6, L7]

1.3 For every $n$ one has $n < \sigma(n)$, since $n + \sigma(0) = \sigma(n + 0) = \sigma(n)$ by the recursion, with $\sigma(0) \ne 0$ [L5]. [given, L5]

1.4 Base case $n = 0$: for arbitrary $m$, either $m = 0$, giving $m = n$, or $m \ne 0$ so $0 + m = m$ [L1] with $m \ne 0$ gives $0 < m$, that is $n < m$; so at least one of $m < n$, $m = n$, $m > n$ holds. [base, L1, L4]

1.5 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n$ and assume that for every $m$ at least one of $m < n$, $m = n$, $m > n$ holds. [ih]

2.1 Successor step: for arbitrary $m$, apply the hypothesis; if $m < n$ then $n = m + k$ with $k \ne 0$, and the recursion gives $m + \sigma(k) = \sigma(m + k) = \sigma(n)$, so $\sigma(n) = m + \sigma(k)$ with $\sigma(k) \ne 0$ [L5], giving $m < \sigma(n)$; if $m = n$ then $m + \sigma(0) = \sigma(m + 0) = \sigma(m) = \sigma(n)$, so $\sigma(n) = m + \sigma(0)$ with $\sigma(0) \ne 0$, giving $m < \sigma(n)$; if $m > n$ then $m = n + i$ with $i \ne 0$, so $i = \sigma(a)$ [L4], and the recursion gives $n + \sigma(a) = \sigma(n + a)$ while the left successor law [L2] gives $\sigma(n) + a = \sigma(n + a)$, so $m = n + \sigma(a) = \sigma(n + a) = \sigma(n) + a$, whence $a = 0$ gives $m = \sigma(n)$ and $a \ne 0$ gives $\sigma(n) < m$; in every case at least one of $m < \sigma(n)$, $m = \sigma(n)$, $m > \sigma(n)$ holds. [step 1.5, given, L2, L4, L5]

3.1 By the induction principle with base 1.4, hypothesis 1.5, and step 2.1, comparability holds for all $m, n$, and with the incompatibilities 1.1 and 1.2 exactly one of $m < n$, $m = n$, $m > n$ holds, so the order is total. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.4, step 2.1, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a \le b$, let $(a_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ and
$(b_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ be sequences of reals with $a_k \le b_k$ for every
$k$, and suppose

$$[a,b] \;\subseteq\; \bigcup_{k \in \mathbb{N}} [a_k, b_k] .$$

If $M \in \mathbb{R}$ satisfies $\sum_{k < n} (b_k - a_k) \le M$ for every
$n \in \mathbb{N}$, then

$$M \;\ge\; b - a .$$

Consequently, if $a < b$ then **no subset of $\mathbb{R}$ containing $[a,b]$ has
measure zero** ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]); in particular none of
the four bounded intervals $[a,b]$, $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$, $(a,b]$ with $a < b$ has
measure zero, so measure zero is not a vacuous notion.

This is the countable strengthening of
[[lem-finite-interval-cover-total-length]], and it is what compactness is spent
on: the countable cover is enlarged to an open one at an arbitrarily small cost
in total length, and [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]] reduces it to a
finite cover, where the finite lemma applies.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a \le b$, sequences $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ with $a_k \le b_k$ for every $k$ and $[a,b] \subseteq \bigcup_k [a_k,b_k]$, and a real $M$ with $\sum_{k<n}(b_k - a_k) \le M$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Throughout, $\theta := 2^{-1}$.

[L1] Measure zero: $A$ is null when for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a sequence of closed intervals covering $A$ all of whose partial total lengths are $\le \varepsilon$; a subset of a null set is null ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

[L2] $[c,d] = \{\, x : c \le x \le d \,\}$ has length $d - c \ge 0$ when $c \le d$; $(c,d)$ is the open interval; a closed bounded interval is bounded ([[def-interval]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L3] Every open interval $(c,d)$ is an open set and every interval $[c,d]$ is a closed set ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L4] A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is compact exactly when it is closed and bounded ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]]); from every family of open sets whose union contains a compact set, either the set is empty and the empty subfamily covers it, or one can extract $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and members $U_0, \dots, U_m$ of the family whose union already contains it ([[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L5] If $[a,b] \subseteq \bigcup_{j \le n}[c_j,d_j]$ with $c_j \le d_j$ and $a \le b$, then $\sum_{j \le n}(d_j - c_j) \ge b - a$; the same holds for covering intervals of any bounded form with those endpoints ([[lem-finite-interval-cover-total-length]]).

[L6] Powers and the geometric series: $\theta^0 = 1$ and $\theta^{k+1} = \theta^k \theta$, all $\theta^k > 0$ for $\theta > 0$, and $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \theta^k = 1/(1-\theta) = 2$ for $\theta = 2^{-1}$; a series of nonnegative terms has all its partial sums at most its sum ([[def-integer-power]], [[thm-geometric-series]], [[def-series]], [[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]]).

[L7] Finite sums: additivity, scaling by a constant, splitting, and monotonicity in the terms ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L8] Every finite list $k_0, \dots, k_m$ of naturals has an upper bound $K \in \mathbb{N}$: by induction on $m$, taking $K = 0$ for the empty case and replacing $K$ by whichever of $K$ and $k_{m+1}$ is the larger, the order of $\mathbb{N}$ being total ([[thm-induction-principle]], [[lem-nat-trichotomy]], [[def-nat-order]]).

[L9] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 > 0$ and $0 < t \cdot 2^{-1} < t$ for $t > 0$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve an inequality; the order is total and transitive ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $M < b - a$. Since $\sum_{k<0}(b_k - a_k) = 0$ by [L7], we have $M \ge 0$, so $b - a > 0$ and $a < b$. Put $\varepsilon := (b - a - M) \cdot 2^{-1}$, a positive real by [L9]. [assume-contra, given, L7, L9]

2.1 For $k \in \mathbb{N}$ put $\delta_k := \varepsilon \cdot 4^{-1} \cdot \theta^{k}$, a positive real by [L6] and [L9], and $J_k := (a_k - \delta_k,\ b_k + \delta_k)$. Each $J_k$ is an open set by [L3], and $[a_k,b_k] \subseteq J_k$ because $a_k - \delta_k < a_k \le x \le b_k < b_k + \delta_k$ for $x \in [a_k,b_k]$, by [L2] and [L9]. Hence $[a,b] \subseteq \bigcup_k [a_k,b_k] \subseteq \bigcup_k J_k$, so $\{\, J_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\}$ is a family of open sets whose union contains $[a,b]$. The length of the interval with endpoints $a_k - \delta_k$ and $b_k + \delta_k$ is $(b_k - a_k) + 2\delta_k = (b_k - a_k) + \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} \cdot \theta^{k}$, by [L2] and [L9]. [step 1.1, given, L2, L3, L6, L9]

3.1 $[a,b]$ is closed and bounded by [L2] and [L3], hence compact by [L4]; so there are $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and members $J_{k_0}, \dots, J_{k_m}$ of the family with $[a,b] \subseteq J_{k_0} \cup \dots \cup J_{k_m}$. By [L8] fix $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $k_t \le K$ for every $t \le m$; then every $J_{k_t}$ occurs among $J_0, \dots, J_K$, so $[a,b] \subseteq \bigcup_{k \le K} J_k$. [step 2.1, L2, L3, L4, L8, choose]

4.1 By [L5], applied to the $K+1$ intervals $J_k$ with endpoints $a_k - \delta_k \le b_k + \delta_k$, one gets $\sum_{k \le K} \big( (b_k - a_k) + \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} \cdot \theta^{k} \big) \ge b - a$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L5]

5.1 The left-hand side is at most $M + \varepsilon$: by [L7] it splits as $\sum_{k < K+1}(b_k - a_k) + \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} \sum_{k < K+1} \theta^{k}$, the first sum is $\le M$ by hypothesis, and the second is $\le \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} \cdot 2 = \varepsilon$ by [L6]. So $b - a \le M + \varepsilon = (b - a + M) \cdot 2^{-1} < b - a$ by [L9], which is impossible; the assumption of step 1.1 is untenable and $M \ge b - a$. For the consequence, let $a < b$ and let $A \supseteq [a,b]$ be null; taking $\varepsilon_1 := (b-a) \cdot 2^{-1} > 0$ in [L1] gives a sequence of closed intervals covering $A$, hence covering $[a,b]$, with every partial total length $\le \varepsilon_1$, so what has just been proved gives $(b-a) \cdot 2^{-1} \ge b - a$ and hence $b - a \le 0$ by [L9], contradicting $a < b$. Finally each of $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$, $(a,b]$ and $[a,b]$ with $a < b$ contains $[a', b']$ for $a' := a + (b-a) \cdot 4^{-1}$ and $b' := b - (b-a) \cdot 4^{-1}$, which satisfy $a < a' < b' < b$ by [L9], so none of them is null. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 4.1, given, L1, L6, L7, L9, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the hypothesis $\sum_{k<n}(b_k - a_k) \le M$ says.** It is the working form of "the total length is at most $M$" recorded in [[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]: for nonnegative terms, having all partial sums below $M$ is the same as convergence with sum below $M$. Stating the lemma with partial sums avoids assuming convergence, and the conclusion is therefore also the statement that a cover of $[a,b]$ whose total length diverges is no counterexample.

- **The $\varepsilon$ is spent on making the cover open, not on the estimate.** Enlarging $[a_k,b_k]$ to $(a_k - \delta_k, b_k + \delta_k)$ adds $2\delta_k$ to the $k$-th length, and the geometric choice $\delta_k = \varepsilon \theta^k/4$ makes the whole added amount at most $\varepsilon$, however many intervals are used. This is the standard device and it recurs in [[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]].

- **Compactness is not optional here.** Without it the finite lemma cannot be reached, and the countable statement is genuinely stronger than the finite one: $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$ is covered by countably many intervals of total length below any $\varepsilon$, and by no finite family of total length below $1$ ([[cex-null-set-not-of-content-zero]]).

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b, c, d \in F$.

1. **Translation invariance.** If $a < b$ then $a + c < b + c$.
2. **Adding inequalities.** If $a < b$ and $c < d$ then $a + c < b + d$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b, c, d \in F$.

[L1] For $x, y \in F$, the relation $x < y$ means $y - x \in P$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] $P$ is closed under addition: if $u, v \in P$ then $u + v \in P$ (axiom O2 of [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a < b$; by the definition of the order this means $b - a \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.2 For every $c \in F$ the field identities give $(b + c) - (a + c) = b - a$. [algebra]

1.3 Assume moreover $c < d$; by the definition of the order this means $d - c \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.4 The field identities give $(b + d) - (a + c) = (b - a) + (d - c)$. [algebra]

2.1 Hence $(b + c) - (a + c) = b - a \in P$, which is exactly $a + c < b + c$, proving claim 1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1]

2.2 Since $b - a \in P$ and $d - c \in P$, closure under addition gives $(b - a) + (d - c) \in P$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, L2]

3.1 Therefore $(b + d) - (a + c) = (b - a) + (d - c) \in P$, which is exactly $a + c < b + d$, proving claim 2. [step 1.4, step 2.2, L1] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b, c \in F$.

1. If $a > 0$ and $b > 0$ then $ab > 0$.
2. If $a > 0$ and $b < 0$ then $ab < 0$.
3. If $a < 0$ and $b < 0$ then $ab > 0$.
4. If $c > 0$ then $a < b \iff ac < bc$.
5. If $c < 0$ then $a < b \iff bc < ac$ (multiplication by a negative reverses order).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b, c \in F$.

[L1] For $x, y \in F$: $x < y \iff y - x \in P$; $x > 0 \iff x \in P$; $x < 0 \iff -x \in P$; and (trichotomy) for each $x$ exactly one of $x \in P$, $x = 0$, $-x \in P$ holds, so $0 \notin P$ and $x \in P \Rightarrow x \neq 0$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] $P$ is closed under multiplication: if $u, v \in P$ then $uv \in P$ (axiom O2 of [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] In any field, $(-u)v = -(uv)$ and $(-u)(-v) = uv$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] In any field, $0 \cdot u = 0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a > 0$ and $b > 0$, i.e. $a \in P$ and $b \in P$; closure gives $ab \in P$, so $ab > 0$, proving claim 1. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.2 Assume $a > 0$ and $b < 0$, i.e. $a \in P$ and $-b \in P$; closure gives $a(-b) \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.3 Assume $a < 0$ and $b < 0$, i.e. $-a \in P$ and $-b \in P$; closure gives $(-a)(-b) \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.4 Assume $c > 0$ and $a < b$, i.e. $c \in P$ and $b - a \in P$; closure gives $(b - a)c \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.5 Assume $c < 0$ and $a < b$, i.e. $-c \in P$ and $b - a \in P$; closure gives $(b - a)(-c) \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

2.1 Since $a(-b) = -(ab)$ by L3, step 1.2 gives $-(ab) \in P$, so $ab < 0$, proving claim 2. [step 1.2, L3, L1]

2.2 Since $(-a)(-b) = ab$ by L3, step 1.3 gives $ab \in P$, so $ab > 0$, proving claim 3. [step 1.3, L3, L1]

2.3 By distributivity $(b - a)c = bc - ac$, so step 1.4 gives $bc - ac \in P$, i.e. $ac < bc$: this is the forward direction of claim 4. [step 1.4, algebra, L1]

2.4 By L3 and distributivity $(b - a)(-c) = -((b - a)c) = -(bc - ac) = ac - bc$, so step 1.5 gives $ac - bc \in P$, i.e. $bc < ac$: this is the forward direction of claim 5. [step 1.5, L3, algebra, L1]

3.1 Conversely, assume $c > 0$ and $ac < bc$; by trichotomy exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds. If $a = b$ then $ac = bc$, contradicting $ac < bc$; if $b < a$ then the argument of step 2.3 applied to the pair $b < a$ gives $bc < ac$, so $bc - ac \in P$ (from $ac < bc$) while $ac - bc \in P$ (from $bc < ac$), putting the element $bc - ac$ and its negative $ac - bc$ both in $P$, which trichotomy forbids; hence $a < b$: this completes claim 4. [assume-hyp, step 2.3, L4, L1, algebra]

4.1 Conversely, assume $c < 0$ and $bc < ac$; by trichotomy exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds. If $a = b$ then $ac = bc$, contradicting $bc < ac$; if $b < a$ then the argument of step 2.4 applied to the pair $b < a$ gives $ac < bc$, so $ac - bc \in P$ (from $bc < ac$) while $bc - ac \in P$ (from $ac < bc$), putting the element $ac - bc$ and its negative $bc - ac$ both in $P$, which trichotomy forbids; hence $a < b$: this completes claim 5.

## Statement

Let $a, b$ be elements of a field ([[def-field]]) and let integer powers be as in
[[def-integer-power]].

1. For all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$: $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$.
2. If $a \ne 0$ then $a^n \ne 0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and $a^{-m} = (a^m)^{-1}$ for every $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ ([[def-int-operations]]).
3. If $a \ne 0$ and $b \ne 0$ then all three identities of claim 1 hold for all $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Elements $a, b$ of a field $F$, naturals $m, n, p, q, k$ and integers ranged over by $m, n$ in claims 2 and 3.

[L1] Definition of powers ([[def-integer-power]]): $a^0 = 1$ and $a^{n+1} = a^n a$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$; and $a^{-n} := (a^n)^{-1}$ for $a \ne 0$ and $n \ge 1$, the two clauses agreeing at $n = 0$.

[L2] Induction principle ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L3] Field arithmetic: multiplication is associative and commutative with identity $1$, and every nonzero element has an inverse ([[def-field]]); inverses are unique ([[lem-of-inverse-unique]], which states uniqueness and nothing further), and HENCE, for $x, y \ne 0$, $(xy)^{-1} = x^{-1} y^{-1}$ and $(x^{-1})^{-1} = x$, since $(xy)(x^{-1}y^{-1}) = 1$ and $x^{-1}x = 1$ exhibit inverses that uniqueness then identifies.

[L4] A field has no zero divisors: $xy = 0$ implies $x = 0$ or $y = 0$ ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]).

[L5] $\mathbb{Z}$ is a commutative ring in which every element is $\iota(k)$ or $-\iota(k)$ for a unique natural $k$ ([[thm-int-comm-ring]], [[lem-nat-embeds-int]], [[def-int-operations]]); we write $k$ for $\iota(k)$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base cases at $n = 0$ for the addition law, the product law and nonvanishing: $a^{m+0} = a^m = a^m \cdot 1 = a^m a^0$ for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$; $(ab)^0 = 1 = 1 \cdot 1 = a^0 b^0$; and if $a \ne 0$ then $a^0 = 1 \ne 0$. [base, L1, L3]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$ for all $m \in \mathbb{N}$, $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$, and $a^n \ne 0$ whenever $a \ne 0$. The iterated-power law $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ is deliberately NOT carried in this hypothesis: its successor step needs the addition law at the exponent pair $(mn, m)$, whose second entry is not the current stage, so that law must be finished first and the iterated law proved afterwards. [ih]

1.3 For $a \ne 0$ and every integer $j$, $a^{-j} = (a^j)^{-1}$: for $j \ge 0$ this is the definition together with the agreement of the two clauses at $j = 0$, and for $j = -k$ with $k \ge 1$ it reads $a^{k} = (a^{-k})^{-1}$, which holds because $a^{-k} = (a^k)^{-1}$ and $(x^{-1})^{-1} = x$ at $x = a^{k}$. That last substitution needs $a^{k} \ne 0$, which is NOT free here and must not be read off the definition, since the definition of the negative clause is what is being justified; it is instead a self-contained induction on $k$, from $a^{0} = 1 \ne 0$ and the fact that $a^{k+1} = a^{k}a$ is a product of two nonzero elements of a field, hence nonzero. [L1, L2, L3, L4, L5]

2.1 Successor step for the addition law, the product law and nonvanishing: $a^{m+(n+1)} = a^{(m+n)+1} = a^{m+n} a = (a^m a^n) a = a^m (a^n a) = a^m a^{n+1}$ for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$; $(ab)^{n+1} = (ab)^n (ab) = (a^n b^n)(ab) = (a^n a)(b^n b) = a^{n+1} b^{n+1}$; and if $a \ne 0$ then $a^{n+1} = a^n a$ is a product of two nonzero elements, hence nonzero. [step 1.2, L1, L3, L4]

3.1 By the induction principle, for all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$: $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$, and $a^n \ne 0$ whenever $a \ne 0$. The addition law is thereby available at EVERY pair of natural exponents, which is exactly what the iterated-power law needs. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L2]

4.1 The iterated-power law for natural exponents, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$, by a second induction on $n$ with $m \in \mathbb{N}$ fixed: at $n = 0$ both sides are $1$, since $(a^m)^0 = 1 = a^0 = a^{m \cdot 0}$; and if $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ then $(a^m)^{n+1} = (a^m)^n a^m = a^{mn} a^m = a^{mn+m} = a^{m(n+1)}$, where the third equality is the addition law of step 3.1 at the pair $(mn, m)$, legitimate precisely because that law is by now proved for all pairs of naturals. This completes claim 1. [step 3.1, L1, L2, L3]

4.2 For $a \ne 0$ and every integer $j$, $a^{j+1} = a^j a$: for $j \ge 0$ this is the recursion clause, and for $j = -k$ with $k \ge 1$ we compute $a^{-k} a = (a^k)^{-1} a = (a^{k-1} a)^{-1} a = (a^{k-1})^{-1} a^{-1} a = (a^{k-1})^{-1} = a^{-(k-1)} = a^{-k+1}$. [step 3.1, step 1.3, L1, L3]

4.3 For $a, b \ne 0$ the product law holds for all integers $n$: for $n \ge 0$ it is step 3.1, and for $n = -k$ with $k \ge 1$ we get $(ab)^{-k} = ((ab)^k)^{-1} = (a^k b^k)^{-1} = (a^k)^{-1}(b^k)^{-1} = a^{-k} b^{-k}$. [step 3.1, step 1.3, L3, L5]

5.1 For $a \ne 0$, every integer $j$ and every natural $k$, $a^{j+k} = a^j a^k$, by induction on $k$: the case $k = 0$ is $a^j = a^j \cdot 1$, and if $a^{j+k} = a^j a^k$ then $a^{j+k+1} = a^{j+k} a = a^j a^k a = a^j a^{k+1}$ by step 4.2 applied to the integer $j+k$ and by the recursion clause. [step 4.2, L1, L2, L3]

6.1 For $a \ne 0$ the addition law holds for all integers $m, n$: writing $n = k$ or $n = -k$ with $k \in \mathbb{N}$, the case $n = k$ is step 5.1, while for $n = -k$ step 5.1 applied to the integer $m - k$ gives $a^m = a^{(m-k)+k} = a^{m-k} a^k$, hence $a^{m-k} = a^m (a^k)^{-1} = a^m a^{-k}$. [step 5.1, step 1.3, L3, L5]

7.1 For $a \ne 0$ the iterated-power law holds for all integers $m, n$: for $n \ge 0$ induction on $n$ gives $(a^m)^{n+1} = (a^m)^n a^m = a^{mn} a^m = a^{mn+m} = a^{m(n+1)}$, the third equality by the integer addition law of step 6.1 at the pair $(mn, m)$, with base $(a^m)^0 = 1 = a^0$; and for $n = -q$ with $q \ge 1$, $(a^m)^{-q} = ((a^m)^q)^{-1} = (a^{mq})^{-1} = a^{-mq} = a^{m(-q)}$, using that $a^m \ne 0$ by step 3.1 and step 1.3. [step 6.1, step 3.1, step 1.3, L2, L3, L5]

8.1 Claims 1, 2 and 3 are therefore established: the addition, product and iterated-power laws for natural exponents together with nonvanishing by steps 3.1 and 4.1, the identity $a^{-m} = (a^m)^{-1}$ by step 1.3, and the three integer-exponent laws by steps 6.1, 4.3 and 7.1. [step 3.1, step 4.1, step 1.3, step 6.1, step 4.3, step 7.1, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Write $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the image of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$
under the canonical embedding $q \mapsto \hat q$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), the
set usually written $\mathbb{Q}$ once the identification is made, and put
$X := \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the irrationals. Then:

1. $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$, that is,
   $\overline{\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}} = \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]);
2. $X$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$;
3. every nonempty open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable
   ([[def-countable]]).

Claim 2 is not a symmetry of claim 1: the rationals are dense because they are
*constructed* to approximate, whereas the irrationals are dense because there are
too many points in any interval for a countable set to exhaust it, which is why
claim 3 is proved alongside and used for it.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The canonical embedding $q \mapsto \hat q$ of $\mathbb{Q}$ into $\mathbb{R}$, its image $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, and the complement $X = \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$.

[L1] $\overline{A}$ is the set of points every neighbourhood of which meets $A$; $A$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ when $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L2] $N_\varepsilon(x) = (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon)$ for real $\varepsilon > 0$, and $x - \varepsilon < x + \varepsilon$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L3] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L4] Strictly between any two reals lies an element of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, and $q \mapsto \hat q$ is injective ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L5] $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-rationals-countable]]); an injection is a bijection onto its image, and $\approx$ is symmetric and transitive ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]], [[def-equinumerous]]).

[L6] Every subset of an at most countable set is at most countable, and uncountable means not at most countable ([[lem-subset-of-countable]], [[def-countable]]).

[L7] For $a < b$ the interval $(a,b)$ is uncountable ([[cor-interval-uncountable]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is dense: let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real; by [L2] one has $x - \varepsilon < x + \varepsilon$, so [L4] supplies $\hat q$ with $x - \varepsilon < \hat q < x + \varepsilon$, that is $\hat q \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$. Every real is therefore an adherent point of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and claim 1 follows from [L1]. [L1, L2, L4]

1.2 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is at most countable: the embedding is an injection of $\mathbb{Q}$ with image $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, hence a bijection onto it, so $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \approx \mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$. [L4, L5]

1.3 For all reals $a < b$ the interval $(a,b)$ is uncountable. [L7]

2.1 For all reals $a < b$ the interval $(a,b)$ contains an irrational: if it did not, then $(a,b) \subseteq \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, so $(a,b)$ would be a subset of an at most countable set by step 1.2 and hence at most countable by [L6], contradicting step 1.3. So some $z \in (a,b)$ lies in $X$. [step 1.2, step 1.3, L6]

2.2 Every nonempty open $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is uncountable: fix $x \in U$ and, by [L3], a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; by [L2] the set $N_\varepsilon(x)$ is the interval $(x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon)$ with $x - \varepsilon < x + \varepsilon$, hence uncountable by step 1.3. Were $U$ at most countable, its subset $N_\varepsilon(x)$ would be at most countable by [L6], which it is not; so $U$ is uncountable, which is claim 3. [step 1.3, L2, L3, L6, choose]

3.1 $X$ is dense: let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real; applying step 2.1 with $a = x - \varepsilon$ and $b = x + \varepsilon$ gives $z \in (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon) \cap X$, which is $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap X$ by [L2]. Every real is therefore an adherent point of $X$, so $\overline{X} = \mathbb{R}$ by [L1], which is claim 2. [step 2.1, L1, L2]

4.1 Claims 1, 2 and 3 are steps 1.1, 3.1 and 2.2, so both $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and its complement are dense in $\mathbb{R}$ and every nonempty open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable. [step 1.1, step 2.2, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Two dense sets can be disjoint.** $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and $X$ partition
  $\mathbb{R}$ and both are dense, so density says nothing about size: one of
  them is countable and the other is not
  ([[cor-irrationals-uncountable]]). What density does say is that neither has
  interior: a set whose complement is dense has empty interior, which is the
  computation carried out for $\mathbb{Q}$ in
  [[ex-closure-interior-boundary-of-q]].

- **Claim 3 is a statement about open sets, not about intervals.** It follows
  from the uncountability of intervals ([[cor-interval-uncountable]]) only
  because openness supplies an interval inside the set at each of its points.
  A nonempty set with empty interior can perfectly well be countable, as
  $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ shows.

- **An explicit irrational is not produced here.** Step 2.1 is a counting
  argument and exhibits nothing. The library does exhibit one separately,
  $\sqrt 2$ ([[thm-of-square-roots]], [[fs-sqrt2-rational]]), and an explicit
  irrational in a given interval $(a,b)$ can be built from it as
  $q_1 + (q_2 - q_1)/\sqrt 2$ for suitable rationals $q_1 < q_2$ in the
  interval; that route is longer and is not the one taken above.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with closure $\overline{A}$ as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]] and derived set $A'$ as in
[[def-limit-point-r]]. Write

$$E \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing \text{ for every real } \varepsilon > 0 \,\}$$

for the set of adherent points of $A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). Then:

1. $\overline{A} = E$.
2. $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$.
3. $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed superset of $A$: it is closed, it
   contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed $F$ with $A \subseteq F$.
4. $A$ is closed if and only if $A = \overline{A}$, if and only if
   $A' \subseteq A$.

Claim 3 is the content of the definition of $\overline{A}$ and is restated here
so that the four descriptions stand together; claims 1, 2 and 4 are the ones
that carry work.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, and the set $E$ of adherent points of $A$ as displayed in the Statement.

[L1] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; $F$ is closed when $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L2] $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$; $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) = N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$; and if $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ then $\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ and $N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] $\overline{A}$ is the intersection of the nonempty family of closed supersets of $A$; it is closed, it contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed superset of $A$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]).

[L4] $x$ is an adherent point of $A$ when every $N_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $A$, a limit point when every $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $A$, and $A'$ is the set of limit points ([[def-limit-point-r]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $A \subseteq E$: for $x \in A$ and any $\varepsilon > 0$ one has $x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$, so that intersection is nonempty. [L2, L4]

1.2 Let $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus E$; by the definition of $E$ there is a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$. [L4, choose]

1.3 Let $F$ be closed with $A \subseteq F$, and let $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus F$; since $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open there is a real $\eta > 0$ with $N_\eta(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus F$. [L1, choose]

2.1 For every $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ the radius $\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x|$ is positive and $N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, so $N_\delta(y) \cap A = \varnothing$ and $y \notin E$; hence $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$, and since $x$ was an arbitrary point of $\mathbb{R} \setminus E$ that set is open, that is, $E$ is closed. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L4]

2.2 From $N_\eta(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus F \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus A$ we get $N_\eta(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, so $x \notin E$; hence $\mathbb{R} \setminus F \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$, that is, $E \subseteq F$, for every closed $F \supseteq A$. [step 1.3, L4]

3.1 By steps 1.1 and 2.1 the set $E$ is a closed superset of $A$, so $\overline{A} \subseteq E$ by the leastness in [L3]; and $\overline{A}$ is itself a closed superset of $A$ by [L3], so step 2.2 applied to $F = \overline{A}$ gives $E \subseteq \overline{A}$. Hence $\overline{A} = E$, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, L3]

4.1 $E = A \cup A'$: if $x \in E$ and $x \notin A$ then for every $\varepsilon > 0$ some $a \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ exists, and $a \ne x$ because $x \notin A$, so $a \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ and $x \in A'$; conversely $A \subseteq E$ by step 1.1, and $A' \subseteq E$ because $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$. Combining with step 3.1 gives $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$, which is claim 2. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L2, L4]

5.1 Claim 4: if $A$ is closed then $A$ is a closed superset of itself, so $\overline{A} \subseteq A$ by [L3], while $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ by [L3], whence $A = \overline{A}$; conversely if $A = \overline{A}$ then $A$ is closed because $\overline{A}$ is. Finally $A = \overline{A}$ says $A = A \cup A'$ by step 4.1, and $A = A \cup A'$ holds exactly when $A' \subseteq A$. [step 4.1, L3]

6.1 Claim 3 is [L3] restated, and claims 1, 2 and 4 are steps 3.1, 4.1 and 5.1, so all four hold. [step 3.1, step 4.1, step 5.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Which claim does the work in practice.** Claim 1 is the one used almost
  everywhere below: to show a point lies in $\overline{A}$ one exhibits, for each
  $\varepsilon > 0$, a point of $A$ within $\varepsilon$ of it. Claim 2 is what
  separates the two ways a point can be adherent, by membership or by
  accumulation, and it is what makes the notion of an isolated point visible.

- **No special property of $\mathbb{R}$ is used.** The argument uses the
  definitions of open, closed, neighbourhood and closure, and the order enters
  only through the nesting property of neighbourhoods; neither the
  least-upper-bound property nor the Archimedean property appears at any step.
  The results of this page that do use them are flagged in
  [[rem-r-native-topology-scope]].

- **The sequential form is a separate theorem and costs more.** Replacing
  "every neighbourhood meets $A$" by "some sequence in $A$ converges to $x$" is
  [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]], and the passage from the
  first to the second spends the axiom of countable choice, since it selects one
  point of $A$ from each of infinitely many neighbourhoods. The characterisation
  proved above is choice free.

## Statement

Let $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be compact ([[def-open-cover-r]]), equivalently
closed and bounded ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]]). Then

$$K \text{ has measure zero} \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad K \text{ has content zero}$$

([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

The implication from content zero to measure zero is
[[lem-content-zero-implies-null]] and needs no hypothesis on $K$. The other
direction is the one that uses compactness, and it uses it exactly as
[[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]] does: a countable cover is enlarged to
an open cover at an arbitrarily small cost in total length, and compactness
reduces the open cover to a finite one.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A compact set $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a real $\varepsilon > 0$. Throughout, $\theta := 2^{-1}$.

[L1] $A$ is null when for every real $\eta > 0$ there are sequences $(a_k)$, $(b_k)$ with $a_k \le b_k$, $A \subseteq \bigcup_k[a_k,b_k]$ and $\sum_{k<i}(b_k - a_k) \le \eta$ for every $i$; $A$ has content zero when the same holds with a finite list ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

[L2] A set of content zero is null ([[lem-content-zero-implies-null]]).

[L3] $[c,d]$ has length $d - c \ge 0$ for $c \le d$; $(c,d)$ is the open interval with the same endpoints and is contained in $[c,d]$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L4] Every open interval is an open set ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L5] $K$ is compact: from every family of open sets whose union contains $K$, either $K = \varnothing$ and the empty subfamily covers it, or there are $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and members $U_0, \dots, U_m$ of the family whose union contains $K$; compactness is equivalent to being closed and bounded ([[def-open-cover-r]], [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]]).

[L6] Powers and the geometric series: $\theta^0 = 1$, $\theta^{k+1} = \theta^k\theta$, $\theta^k > 0$, and $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\theta^k = 2$ for $\theta = 2^{-1}$; a series of nonnegative terms has all its partial sums at most its sum ([[def-integer-power]], [[thm-geometric-series]], [[def-series]], [[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]]).

[L7] Finite sums: additivity, scaling, splitting and monotonicity in the terms ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L8] Every finite list of naturals has an upper bound in $\mathbb{N}$, by induction on its length and the totality of the order of $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]], [[lem-nat-trichotomy]], [[def-nat-order]]).

[L9] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 > 0$, $4 > 0$, $8 > 0$ and $t \cdot 8^{-1} > 0$ for $t > 0$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve an inequality ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 One direction is immediate: if $K$ has content zero then $K$ is null by [L2], with no hypothesis on $K$ used. It remains to prove the converse for compact $K$. [L2, suffices: only the forward direction remains]

1.2 If $K = \varnothing$, then for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the single interval $[0,0]$ covers $K$ and has total length $0 \le \varepsilon$, so $K$ has content zero by [L1]. Hence suppose $K \ne \varnothing$ for the rest of the proof. [L1, cases]

2.1 Assume $K$ is null and let the real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. By [L1] applied with $\eta := \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} > 0$ fix sequences $(a_k)$, $(b_k)$ with $a_k \le b_k$, $K \subseteq \bigcup_k [a_k,b_k]$ and $\sum_{k<i}(b_k - a_k) \le \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$ for every $i \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 1.1, given, L1, L9, choose]

3.1 Put $\delta_k := \varepsilon \cdot 8^{-1} \cdot \theta^{k}$, a positive real by [L6] and [L9], and $J_k := (a_k - \delta_k,\ b_k + \delta_k)$, an open set by [L4] containing $[a_k,b_k]$ by [L3] and [L9]. Hence $\{\, J_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\}$ is a family of open sets whose union contains $K$, and the closed interval $[a_k - \delta_k,\ b_k + \delta_k]$ has length $(b_k - a_k) + 2\delta_k = (b_k - a_k) + \varepsilon \cdot 4^{-1} \cdot \theta^{k}$ by [L3] and [L9]. [step 2.1, L3, L4, L6, L9]

4.1 By [L5] there are $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and members $J_{k_0}, \dots, J_{k_m}$ of that family covering $K$, and by [L8] there is $N \in \mathbb{N}$ with $k_t \le N$ for every $t \le m$; then $K \subseteq \bigcup_{k \le N} J_k \subseteq \bigcup_{k \le N}[a_k - \delta_k,\ b_k + \delta_k]$ by [L3]. [step 1.2, step 3.1, L3, L5, L8, choose]

5.1 The total length of that finite list is $\sum_{k \le N}\big((b_k - a_k) + \varepsilon \cdot 4^{-1}\theta^{k}\big) = \sum_{k<N+1}(b_k - a_k) + \varepsilon \cdot 4^{-1}\sum_{k<N+1}\theta^{k} \le \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} + \varepsilon \cdot 4^{-1} \cdot 2 = \varepsilon$, by [L7], step 2.1, [L6] and [L9]. [step 2.1, step 3.1, step 4.1, L6, L7, L9]

6.1 So for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the finite list of step 4.1 covers $K$ with total length at most $\varepsilon$, which by [L1] is exactly the statement that $K$ has content zero; together with step 1.1 the two notions coincide on compact sets. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 4.1, step 5.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Compactness, not boundedness, is what does the work.** $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$ is bounded and null and does not have content zero ([[cex-null-set-not-of-content-zero]]); it fails to be closed, and the finite subcover step is exactly what it cannot supply.

- **The theorem is what makes content zero usable at all.** Every set to which content zero is applied on this page is compact: the Cantor set ([[thm-cantor-set-properties]]) and the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set ([[def-fat-cantor-set]]) are both closed and bounded, so for them the two notions may be used interchangeably, and the finite form is the one that combines with [[lem-finite-interval-cover-total-length]].

- **The cost of opening up the cover is $\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$, chosen in advance.** Splitting the budget in half before the enlargement, rather than after, is what keeps the final total at $\varepsilon$ exactly; the same bookkeeping appears in [[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]] and in [[thm-countable-union-of-null-is-null]].

## Statement

Let $r \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $r^k$ be the integer power ([[def-integer-power]]),
so that $r^0 = 1$ for every $r$, including $r = 0$.

1. If $|r| < 1$ then the series $\sum r^k$ converges ([[def-series]]) and
   $$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} r^{k} \;=\; \frac{1}{1-r} .$$
2. If $|r| \ge 1$ then $\sum r^k$ diverges.

The series starts at $k = 0$ and its first term is $r^0 = 1$; in particular
$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} 2^{-k} = 2$, while the series starting at $k = 1$ sums to
$1$. Which starting index is meant has to be said, and it is said here.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real number $r$, the integer powers $r^k$ ([[def-integer-power]]), and the partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} r^k$ of $\sum r^k$ ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[L1] Factorisation of a difference of powers: for $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and natural $n \ge 1$, $b^n - a^n = (b-a)\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a^k b^{\,n-1-k}$ ([[lem-power-difference-factorisation]]).

[L2] For $|r| < 1$ the sequence $(r^k)$ is null, that is $r^k \to 0$ ([[lem-geometric-sequence-null]]).

[L3] Algebra of limits: sums, differences and quotients of convergent sequences converge to the corresponding combination, the quotient rule requiring a nonzero limit and nonzero denominators ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L4] Absolute value: $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$, $|x| \ge 0$, and $|x| = 0$ exactly when $x = 0$; also $|1| = 1$, since $1 > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L5] Powers and order: $a^0 = 1$ for every $a$; if $a \ge 1$ and $n \ge 1$ then $a^n \ge a \ge 1$; and $1^n = 1$ for every $n$ ([[lem-power-monotone]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L6] The principle of induction ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L7] If a series converges then its terms tend to $0$ ([[lem-nth-term-test]]).

[L8] Notation of [[def-finite-sum]]: $\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x_k$ is $\sum_{k<n} x_k$, and the empty sum $\sum_{k<0} x_k$ is $0$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Assume $|r| < 1$. [assume-case lt]

1.2 Assume instead $|r| \ge 1$. [assume-case ge]

1.3 For every natural $n \ge 1$, applying [L1] with $b = 1$ and $a = r$ gives $1 - r^n = (1-r)\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} r^k \cdot 1^{\,n-1-k} = (1-r)\,s_n$, using $1^m = 1$ and the notation of [L8]. [L1, L5, L8]

1.4 At $n = 0$ the identity $1 - r^n = (1-r)s_n$ also holds, both sides being $0$ because $r^0 = 1$ and $s_0$ is the empty sum. [L5, L8]

2.1 In the case $|r| < 1$ we have $r \ne 1$, since $|1| = 1$ and $|r| < 1$; hence $1 - r \ne 0$. [step 1.1, L4, algebra]

2.2 In the case $|r| \ge 1$, an induction gives $|r^k| = |r|^k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$: at $k = 0$ both sides are $1$, and if $|r^k| = |r|^k$ then $|r^{k+1}| = |r^k \cdot r| = |r^k|\,|r| = |r|^k |r| = |r|^{k+1}$. [step 1.2, L4, L5, L6]

2.3 In the case $|r| \ge 1$ we get $|r|^k \ge 1$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$: at $k = 0$ this reads $1 \ge 1$, and for $k \ge 1$ it is the comparison $|r|^k \ge |r| \ge 1$. [step 1.2, L5]

3.1 In the case $|r| < 1$, dividing by $1 - r \ne 0$ gives $s_n = (1 - r^n)/(1-r)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.1, step 1.3, step 1.4, algebra]

3.2 In the case $|r| \ge 1$, combining the two previous steps gives $|r^k - 0| = |r^k| = |r|^k \ge 1$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.2, step 2.3]

4.1 In the case $|r| < 1$ the sequence $(r^n)$ is null, so $1 - r^n \to 1$ and therefore $s_n \to 1/(1-r)$, the denominator being the nonzero constant $1-r$; hence $\sum r^k$ converges with sum $1/(1-r)$, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 3.1, step 2.1, L2, L3]

4.2 In the case $|r| \ge 1$ the sequence $(r^k)$ does not converge to $0$, since the rational tolerance $\varepsilon = 1$ admits no index $K$ with $|r^k - 0| < 1$ for all $k \ge K$; so by the term test $\sum r^k$ diverges, which is claim 2. [step 3.2, L7]

5.1 The two cases $|r| < 1$ and $|r| \ge 1$ exhaust the possibilities, since the order on $\mathbb{R}$ is total, so claims 1 and 2 together cover every real $r$. [step 4.1, step 4.2, cases-exhaustive] ∎

## Remarks

- **The divergence half needs no separate treatment of $r = 1$ and $r = -1$.** Both are covered by $|r| \ge 1$, and the single reason is the same in every case: the terms have absolute value at least $1$, so they cannot tend to $0$. For $r = 1$ the partial sums are $s_n = n$ and run to $+\infty$; for $r = -1$ they oscillate between $0$ and $1$. The theorem says only that neither converges, which is all that "diverges" means here ([[def-series]]).

- **Why the identity is proved at $n = 0$ separately.** [[lem-power-difference-factorisation]] requires $n \ge 1$, since its right-hand side is a sum over $k < n$ of a term involving $b^{\,n-1-k}$, and $n-1$ is not a natural number at $n = 0$. The identity is still true at $n = 0$, but by inspection of two empty objects rather than by that lemma, and step 1.4 says so rather than letting the reader assume the citation covers it.

## Statement

Let $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $K$ is compact ([[def-open-cover-r]]) if and
only if $K$ is closed ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) and bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]).

This is the Heine-Borel theorem in the form used everywhere below. The forward
implication is [[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]] and spends no
completeness, only the Archimedean property and the existence of maxima of
finite sets; the backward implication rests on
[[thm-heine-borel-r]] and therefore on the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$, and the
remarks below record where it fails without completeness.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] Open cover, finite subfamily and compactness; the empty subfamily covers $\varnothing$ ([[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L2] A compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is closed and bounded ([[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]]).

[L3] Every closed bounded interval $[\ell,u]$ with $\ell \le u$ is compact ([[thm-heine-borel-r]]).

[L4] $K$ is closed exactly when $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L5] $K$ is bounded exactly when there are $\ell, u \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\ell \le y \le u$ for every $y \in K$ ([[def-bounded-set]]).

[L6] $[\ell,u] = \{\, z \in \mathbb{R} : \ell \le z \le u \,\}$ ([[def-interval]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 If $K$ is compact then $K$ is closed and bounded, which is [L2]; this is the forward implication. [L2]

1.2 For the backward implication assume $K$ is closed and bounded. If $K = \varnothing$ then every open cover of $K$ admits the empty subfamily as a finite subcover, so $K$ is compact. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.3 Assume moreover $K \ne \varnothing$; fix $s \in K$ and, by [L5], reals $\ell, u$ with $\ell \le y \le u$ for every $y \in K$. Then $\ell \le s \le u$, so $\ell \le u$, and $K \subseteq [\ell,u]$ by [L6]. [assume-hyp, L5, L6, choose]

2.1 Let $\mathcal{U}$ be an open cover of $K$ and put $\mathcal{W} := \mathcal{U} \cup \{\mathbb{R} \setminus K\}$. Every member of $\mathcal{W}$ is open, since $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$ is open by [L4], and $\mathcal{W}$ covers $[\ell,u]$: a point of $[\ell,u]$ either lies in $K$, hence in some member of $\mathcal{U}$, or lies outside $K$, hence in $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$. [step 1.3, L1, L4]

3.1 By [L3] the interval $[\ell,u]$ is compact, so some finite subfamily $\{W_0, \dots, W_p\}$ of $\mathcal{W}$ covers $[\ell,u]$, where the case of an empty subfamily is possible only when $[\ell,u] = \varnothing$, which is excluded by $\ell \le u$. Put $\mathcal{V} := \{\, W_i : W_i \in \mathcal{U} \,\}$, a finite subfamily of $\mathcal{U}$. Then $K \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{V}$: a point $y \in K \subseteq [\ell,u]$ lies in some $W_i$, and $W_i$ cannot be a member of $\mathcal{W}$ outside $\mathcal{U}$, because the only such member is $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$ and $y \in K$; so $W_i \in \mathcal{U}$ and $W_i \in \mathcal{V}$. [step 2.1, L1, L3, L6]

4.1 Every open cover of a nonempty closed bounded $K$ therefore has a finite subcover, so such a $K$ is compact; together with the empty case of step 1.2 this proves the backward implication, and step 1.1 is the forward one. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 3.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **A closed subset of a compact set is compact.** If $C \subseteq K$ with $K$
  compact and $C$ closed, then $C$ is bounded, being a subset of a bounded set,
  and closed by hypothesis, so it is compact by the theorem. The corresponding
  statement for arbitrary subsets is false: $(0,1) \subseteq [0,1]$ is bounded
  and not compact ([[cex-unbounded-closed-set-not-compact]]).

- **Both hypotheses are needed and neither implies the other.**
  [[cex-unbounded-closed-set-not-compact]] exhibits a closed set that is not
  bounded and a bounded set that is not closed, and neither is compact.

- **What the theorem is not.** It characterises compactness *for subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$*. The two halves are of very different strengths: the forward
  half is elementary and general, while the backward half rests on the
  completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ and fails over $\mathbb{Q}$
  ([[fs-closed-bounded-compact-without-completeness]], witnessed by
  [[cex-closed-bounded-in-q-not-compact]]). Nothing here licenses "closed and
  bounded implies compact" in any other setting.

## Statement

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. If $0 \in S$ and $\sigma(n) \in S$ whenever $n \in S$, then $S = \mathbb{N}$. Equivalently (property form): if a property $P$ satisfies $P(0)$ and ($P(n) \Rightarrow P(\sigma(n))$) for all $n$, then $P(n)$ holds for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. This is the induction principle, the basis of proof by induction.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $\mathbb{N} = \omega$ is the smallest inductive set ([[def-inductive-set]], [[def-natural-numbers]], [[lem-omega-smallest-inductive]]); $0 = \varnothing$, $\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$.

[L1] $\omega$ is contained in every inductive set ([[lem-omega-smallest-inductive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Suppose $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ with $0 = \varnothing \in S$ and ($x \in S \Rightarrow \sigma(x) = x \cup \{x\} \in S$). [given]

2.1 Then $S$ contains $\varnothing$ and is closed under $x \mapsto x \cup \{x\}$, so $S$ is an inductive set. [step 1.1]

3.1 $\mathbb{N} = \omega \subseteq S$ because $\omega$ is a subset of every inductive set. [L1, step 2.1]

4.1 With $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ by hypothesis, $S = \mathbb{N}$. [step 3.1, given]

5.1 The property form is the set case with $S = \{n \in \mathbb{N} : P(n)\}$: $P(0)$ and $P(n) \Rightarrow P(\sigma(n))$ give $0 \in S$ and $\sigma$-closure, so $S = \mathbb{N}$, i.e. $P$ holds for all $n$; conversely the set form is the property form applied to $P(n) :\equiv n \in S$, so the two are equivalent. [step 4.1] ∎

## Statement

$\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-equinumerous]]): the
plane of pairs of naturals is countably infinite ([[def-countable]]).

The bijection is exhibited, not merely asserted to exist. Define $2^m$ by
recursion on $m$ ([[thm-recursion]]) by $2^0 = 1$ and $2^{\sigma(m)} = 2^m + 2^m$,
and set

$$J(m,n) = 2^m \cdot \sigma(n + n), \qquad \text{that is} \qquad J(m,n) = 2^m(2n+1).$$

Then $J$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ onto
$\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, and $\sigma$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N}$ onto
$\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, so $\sigma^{-1} \circ J$ is a bijection
$\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$. What makes $J$ bijective is the
decomposition of a nonzero natural into a power of two times an odd number,
existence and uniqueness both.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Addition and multiplication on $\mathbb{N}$ with $m + 0 = m$, $m + \sigma(k) = \sigma(m + k)$, $m \cdot 0 = 0$ and $m \cdot \sigma(k) = m \cdot k + m$ ([[def-nat-addition]], [[def-nat-multiplication]]); $1 := \sigma(0)$. Call $k \in \mathbb{N}$ **even** if $k = j + j$ for some $j$ and **odd** if $k = \sigma(j + j)$ for some $j$.

[L1] Recursion: for a set $X$, $x_0 \in X$ and $F : X \to X$ there is $h : \mathbb{N} \to X$ with $h(0) = x_0$ and $h(\sigma(m)) = F(h(m))$ ([[thm-recursion]]).

[L2] Peano: $\sigma(k) \ne 0$ and $\sigma$ is injective ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]); every nonzero natural is a successor ([[lem-nat-nonzero-is-successor]]).

[L3] Arithmetic laws: $+$ and $\cdot$ are commutative and associative, $1 \cdot n = n = n \cdot 1$, $0 + n = n$, $a(b + c) = ab + ac$ and $\sigma(a) + n = \sigma(a + n)$ ([[lem-nat-add-commutative]], [[lem-nat-add-associative]], [[lem-nat-add-identity]], [[lem-nat-mult-commutative]], [[lem-nat-mult-associative]], [[lem-nat-mult-identity]], [[lem-nat-mult-distributive]], [[lem-nat-add-successor-left]]).

[L4] Order laws: exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds ([[lem-nat-trichotomy]]); $\le$ is reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive and total ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]), so $<$ is transitive and mixes with $\le$, in the sense that each of $a < b < c$, $a \le b < c$ and $a < b \le c$ gives $a < c$: transitivity of $\le$ gives $a \le c$ in every case, while $a = c$ would force $b = c$ or $a = b$ by antisymmetry, contradicting whichever of the two hypotheses is strict; and $<$ is irreflexive, because $a < a$ would demand $a \ne a$ ([[def-nat-order]]); $a \le b \iff a + k \le b + k$ and $a < b \iff a + k < b + k$ ([[lem-nat-order-add-compatible]]); $a < b \iff \sigma(a) \le b$, so $a < \sigma(a)$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]); and $a \le b$ means $a + c = b$ for some $c$ ([[def-nat-order]]), where moreover $a < b$ holds exactly when that $c$ is nonzero, since $c = 0$ gives $b = a$, while $c \ne 0$ with $a = b$ would give $c + a = a + c = a = 0 + a$ and hence $c = 0$ by additive cancellation ([[lem-nat-add-cancellative]], [[lem-nat-add-commutative]], [[lem-nat-add-identity]]).

[L5] Cancellation: $a \cdot k = b \cdot k$ with $k \ne 0$ gives $a = b$ ([[lem-nat-mult-cancellative]]); and $a \cdot b = 0$ forces $a = 0$ or $b = 0$ ([[lem-nat-no-zero-divisors]]).

[L6] Induction ([[thm-induction-principle]]) and strong induction ([[thm-strong-induction]]).

[L7] Bijections, injections, surjections, composition and inverses ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]); $A \approx B$ means a bijection $A \to B$ exists ([[def-equinumerous]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Apply [L1] with $X = \mathbb{N}$, $x_0 = 1$ and $F(x) = x + x$: this defines $m \mapsto 2^m$ with $2^0 = 1$ and $2^{\sigma(m)} = 2^m + 2^m$ for all $m$. [L1, construct]

1.2 Every natural is even or odd: by induction, $0 = 0 + 0$ is even; and if $k = j + j$ is even then $\sigma(k) = \sigma(j + j)$ is odd, while if $k = \sigma(j + j)$ is odd then $\sigma(k) = \sigma(\sigma(j+j)) = \sigma(\sigma(j) + j) = \sigma(j) + \sigma(j)$ is even, using $\sigma(j) + j = \sigma(j + j)$ and $x + \sigma(y) = \sigma(x + y)$. [L3, L6, given]

1.3 No natural is both even and odd, that is $j + j \ne \sigma(i + i)$ for all $i, j$: if $j \le i$ then $j + j \le i + j = j + i \le i + i < \sigma(i + i)$; if $i < j$ then $\sigma(i) \le j$, so $\sigma(i+i) < \sigma(\sigma(i+i)) = \sigma(\sigma(i) + i) = \sigma(i) + \sigma(i) \le j + j$; in both cases the two sides differ by irreflexivity of $<$. [L3, L4, given]

1.4 $\sigma$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N}$ onto $\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$: it is injective by [L2], its values are nonzero by [L2], and every nonzero natural is a value of $\sigma$ by [L2]. [L2, L7]

2.1 $2^m \ne 0$ for every $m$: by induction, $2^0 = \sigma(0) \ne 0$; and if $2^m \ne 0$ then $2^m = \sigma(a)$ for some $a$ by [L2], so $2^{\sigma(m)} = 2^m + 2^m = 2^m + \sigma(a) = \sigma(2^m + a) \ne 0$. [step 1.1, L2, L6, given]

2.2 $2^{m + d} = 2^m \cdot 2^d$ for all $m, d$: by induction on $d$, at $d = 0$ both sides are $2^m$ since $m + 0 = m$ and $2^m \cdot 1 = 2^m$; and if $2^{m+d} = 2^m \cdot 2^d$ then $2^{m + \sigma(d)} = 2^{\sigma(m+d)} = 2^{m+d} + 2^{m+d} = 2^m 2^d + 2^m 2^d = 2^m (2^d + 2^d) = 2^m \cdot 2^{\sigma(d)}$. [step 1.1, L3, L6, given]

3.1 Define $J : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ by $J(m,n) = 2^m \cdot \sigma(n+n)$. Its values are nonzero: $2^m \ne 0$ by step 2.1 and $\sigma(n+n) \ne 0$ by [L2], so $J(m,n) \ne 0$ by [L5]. Thus $J$ maps into $\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L2, L5, construct]

4.1 $J$ is injective. Suppose $2^m \sigma(n+n) = 2^{m'} \sigma(n'+n')$; by [L4] we may assume $m \le m'$, the other case being symmetric, and write $m' = m + d$. By step 2.2 the right side is $2^m (2^d \sigma(n'+n'))$, so cancelling the nonzero factor $2^m$ with [L5] and [L3] gives $\sigma(n+n) = 2^d \cdot \sigma(n'+n')$. If $d \ne 0$ then $d = \sigma(e)$ by [L2] and $2^d = 2^e + 2^e$, so the right side equals $w + w$ with $w = 2^e \sigma(n'+n')$, by [L3]; that would make $\sigma(n+n)$ both odd and even, contradicting step 1.3. Hence $d = 0$ and $m' = m$, and then $\sigma(n+n) = \sigma(n'+n')$ gives $n + n = n' + n'$ by injectivity of $\sigma$, whence $n = n'$ because $n < n'$ would force $n + n < n' + n = n + n' < n' + n'$ by [L4] and [L3], and symmetrically for $n' < n$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, L2, L3, L4, L5]

4.2 $J$ is surjective onto $\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$: by strong induction [L6] we show every $k$ is $0$ or a value of $J$. Let $k \ne 0$ and assume the claim for all $j < k$. By step 1.2, $k$ is odd or even. If $k = \sigma(j+j)$ then $k = 1 \cdot \sigma(j+j) = 2^0 \sigma(j+j) = J(0,j)$ by [L3]. If $k = j + j$ then $j \ne 0$, since $j = 0$ would give $k = 0$; also $j < j + j = k$ by [L4], because $j + j = k$ with $j \ne 0$; so the hypothesis at $j$ and $j \ne 0$ give $j = 2^m \sigma(n+n)$ for some $m, n$, and then $k = j + j = 2^m \sigma(n+n) + 2^m \sigma(n+n) = (2^m + 2^m) \sigma(n+n) = 2^{\sigma(m)} \sigma(n+n) = J(\sigma(m), n)$ by [L3] and step 1.1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 3.1, L3, L4, L6]

5.1 Therefore $J$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ onto $\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, and composing with the inverse of the bijection $\sigma$ of step 1.4 yields the bijection $\sigma^{-1} \circ J : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$; hence $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \approx \mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ is countably infinite. [step 1.4, step 4.1, step 4.2, L7] ∎

## Remarks

- Written out, $\sigma^{-1}(J(m,n)) = 2^m(2n+1) - 1$, the standard bijection. The detour through $\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$ avoids subtraction, which the naturals do not have as a total operation.

- The proof is a proof of unique factorisation into a power of two times an odd number: step 4.2 is existence and step 4.1 is uniqueness. Nothing weaker would do, and no appeal to a picture of the diagonal enumeration is made anywhere. Nothing here uses any choice principle.

- The Cantor pairing polynomial $(m,n) \mapsto \tfrac{(m+n)(m+n+1)}{2} + n$ is an alternative bijection. It is not used because halving is not available in $\mathbb{N}$ without first developing division with remainder, whereas doubling, which is all $2^m$ needs, is immediate from addition.

## Statement

Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals with $a_k \ge 0$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$,
let $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ be its partial sums and let
$S = \{\, s_n : n \in \mathbb{N} \,\}$ be the range of $(s_n)$ ([[def-series]]).
Then:

1. $(s_n)$ is nondecreasing ([[def-monotone-sequence]]) and $s_n \ge 0$ for every
   $n$;
2. $\sum a_k$ converges **if and only if** $S$ is bounded above
   ([[def-bounded-set]]), and in that case
   $$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k \;=\; \sup S ,$$
   so in particular $s_n \le \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k$ for every $n$;
3. if $S$ is not bounded above then $s_n \to +\infty$
   ([[def-divergence-to-infinity]]) and $\sum a_k$ diverges.

This is the theorem that makes the nonnegative theory work: for terms of one
sign, convergence is a boundedness question and no candidate limit is ever
needed. Every comparison test on this page is an application of it.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(a_k)$ of reals with $a_k \ge 0$ for every $k$, its partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$, and the range $S = \{s_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L1] The recursion clause of the finite sum: $s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ ([[def-finite-sum]]).

[L2] Consecutive comparisons suffice for monotonicity: $(x_k)$ is nondecreasing if and only if $x_k \le x_{k+1}$ for every $k$; and a nondecreasing sequence is bounded below by its first term ([[def-monotone-sequence]]).

[L3] Monotonicity of finite sums: if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L4] A monotone sequence converges if and only if it is bounded, that is if and only if there is $M$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for every $k$ ([[cor-monotone-converges-iff-bounded]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L5] A nondecreasing sequence bounded above converges to the supremum of its range, which exists by the least-upper-bound property ([[thm-monotone-convergence]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L6] A nondecreasing sequence whose range is not bounded above diverges to $+\infty$ ([[lem-monotone-unbounded-diverges]], [[def-divergence-to-infinity]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For every $n$, $s_{n+1} - s_n = a_n \ge 0$, so $s_n \le s_{n+1}$ and $(s_n)$ is nondecreasing. [given, L1, L2]

1.2 For every $n$, $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, all terms being nonnegative. [given, L3]

2.1 Claim 1 is steps 1.1 and 1.2 together. [step 1.1, step 1.2]

2.2 Since $s_n \ge 0$ we have $|s_n| = s_n$, so $(s_n)$ is bounded in the sense of [L4] if and only if $S$ is bounded above. [step 1.2, L4]

3.1 By [L4] applied to the monotone sequence $(s_n)$, the series converges if and only if $(s_n)$ is bounded, hence if and only if $S$ is bounded above. [step 1.1, step 2.2, L4]

4.1 If $S$ is bounded above then $(s_n)$ converges to $\sup S$, so $\sum a_k$ converges with sum $\sup S$; and since $\sup S$ is an upper bound of $S$, $s_n \le \sup S$ for every $n$. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L5]

4.2 If $S$ is not bounded above then $s_n \to +\infty$, and by step 3.1 the series diverges. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L6]

5.1 The equivalence and the identification of the sum as the supremum together make claim 2, and the divergence statement is claim 3. [step 3.1, step 4.1, step 4.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **"Bounded" and "bounded above" coincide here, and only here.** The equivalence used in step 2.2 rests on $s_n \ge 0$, which rests on every term being nonnegative. For a series with terms of both signs the partial sums can be bounded above and still fail to converge, so nothing in this theorem survives the loss of the sign hypothesis. That failure is exhibited by [[cex-comparison-needs-nonnegativity]] on the companion page.

- **Claim 3 is a strictly stronger statement than "diverges".** Divergence alone permits oscillation ([[def-series]]); for nonnegative terms it cannot occur, and the partial sums necessarily run to $+\infty$. This is what licenses the phrase "the series diverges to $+\infty$" for nonnegative terms, and it is what the Abel-Dini theorem later on this page uses.

- **This criterion is the monotone convergence property, worn differently.** The proof above is monotone convergence for $\mathbb{R}$ applied to the nondecreasing sequence of partial sums, and nothing is lost going back the other way. Given a nondecreasing sequence $(x_n)$ of reals, put $y_n := x_n - x_0 \ge 0$ and let $a_0 := 0$, $a_{k+1} := y_{k+1} - y_k \ge 0$; then $s_{n+1} = y_n$ ([[def-series]]), the partial sums are bounded exactly when $(x_n)$ is bounded above, and claim 1 returns the convergence of $(y_n)$ and so of $(x_n)$. Testing boundedness of partial sums is therefore not a device special to series. Read in the vocabulary of [[def-completeness-properties]] it is the property (MCT), which in an arbitrary ordered field already forces the Archimedean property on its own ([[lem-mct-implies-archimedean]]) and with it the least-upper-bound property ([[lem-mct-implies-lub]]). The translation just given is carried out in $\mathbb{R}$, since [[def-series]] is stated for sequences of reals and this library defines no series over a general ordered field.

## Statement

Let open and closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ be as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

1. **Arbitrary unions of open sets are open.** If $\mathcal{U}$ is any family of
   open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, then $\bigcup \mathcal{U}$ is open.
2. **Finite intersections of open sets are open.** If $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
   $U_0, \dots, U_n$ are open, then $U_0 \cap \dots \cap U_n$ is open.
3. **Arbitrary intersections of closed sets are closed.** If $\mathcal{F}$ is a
   nonempty family of closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, then
   $\bigcap \mathcal{F}$ is closed.
4. **Finite unions of closed sets are closed.** If $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
   $F_0, \dots, F_n$ are closed, then $F_0 \cup \dots \cup F_n$ is closed.

The word *finite* in claims 2 and 4 is not decoration: an arbitrary
intersection of open sets need not be open, and dually an arbitrary union
of closed sets need not be closed; the remarks below say where that is settled.
Claim 3 asks $\mathcal{F}$ to be nonempty
only so that $\bigcap \mathcal{F}$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ without appeal to
a convention about the empty intersection.

**Given:** A family $\mathcal{U}$ of open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, with $\bigcup \mathcal{U} = \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \in U \text{ for some } U \in \mathcal{U} \,\}$; a natural number $n$ and open sets $U_0, \dots, U_n$; a nonempty family $\mathcal{F}$ of closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, with $\bigcap \mathcal{F} = \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \in F \text{ for every } F \in \mathcal{F} \,\}$; and closed sets $F_0, \dots, F_n$.

[A1] De Morgan's laws in the ambient set theory: for a nonempty family $\mathcal{G}$ of subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{R} \setminus \bigcap \mathcal{G} = \bigcup \{\, \mathbb{R} \setminus G : G \in \mathcal{G} \,\}$, and $\mathbb{R} \setminus (G_0 \cup \dots \cup G_n) = (\mathbb{R} \setminus G_0) \cap \dots \cap (\mathbb{R} \setminus G_n)$. Also $\mathbb{R} \setminus (\mathbb{R} \setminus G) = G$.

[L1] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; $F$ is closed when $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L2] $N_\varepsilon(x) = \{\, y : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}$, and $0 < \delta \le \varepsilon$ gives $N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] Every nonempty finite set of reals has a minimum, so $\min\{\varepsilon, \eta\}$ is defined and equals one of the two entries, and is $\le$ both ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $x \in \bigcup \mathcal{U}$. Then $x \in U$ for some $U \in \mathcal{U}$, and $U$ is open, so there is $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{U}$; as $x$ was arbitrary, $\bigcup \mathcal{U}$ is open, which is claim 1. [given, L1, choose]

1.2 Now let $U$ and $V$ be open and let $x \in U \cap V$; fix $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$ and $\eta > 0$ with $N_\eta(x) \subseteq V$. [given, L1, choose]

2.1 Put $\delta := \min\{\varepsilon, \eta\}$, which is one of $\varepsilon, \eta$ and hence $> 0$, and satisfies $\delta \le \varepsilon$ and $\delta \le \eta$; then $N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$ and $N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\eta(x) \subseteq V$, so $N_\delta(x) \subseteq U \cap V$, and as $x$ was arbitrary $U \cap V$ is open. [step 1.2, L2, L3]

2.2 The family $\{\, \mathbb{R} \setminus F : F \in \mathcal{F} \,\}$ consists of open sets by [L1], so its union is open by step 1.1; that union is $\mathbb{R} \setminus \bigcap \mathcal{F}$ by [A1], so $\bigcap \mathcal{F}$ is closed, which is claim 3. [step 1.1, A1, L1]

3.1 Claim 2 now follows by induction on $n$: for $n = 0$ the intersection is $U_0$, which is open by hypothesis; and if $W := U_0 \cap \dots \cap U_n$ is open then $U_0 \cap \dots \cap U_{n+1} = W \cap U_{n+1}$ is an intersection of two open sets, hence open by step 2.1. [step 2.1, given]

4.1 Each $\mathbb{R} \setminus F_i$ is open by [L1], so $(\mathbb{R} \setminus F_0) \cap \dots \cap (\mathbb{R} \setminus F_n)$ is open by step 3.1; that set is $\mathbb{R} \setminus (F_0 \cup \dots \cup F_n)$ by [A1], so $F_0 \cup \dots \cup F_n$ is closed, which is claim 4. [step 3.1, A1, L1]

5.1 Claims 1, 2, 3 and 4 are steps 1.1, 3.1, 2.2 and 4.1 respectively, so arbitrary unions and finite intersections of open sets are open, and arbitrary intersections and finite unions of closed sets are closed. [step 1.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, step 4.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Completeness plays no part.** Nothing above uses the least-upper-bound
  property, or even the Archimedean property: the only facts about $\mathbb{R}$
  the proof touches are the definition of a neighbourhood, its monotonicity in
  the radius, and the comparison of two positive radii. What needs completeness
  is not the algebra of open sets but the theorems about compactness that come
  later.

- **Why finiteness cannot be dropped in claim 2.** The minimum taken in step 2.1
  is a minimum of finitely many positive radii, and it is positive precisely
  because it is one of them ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]). An infinite family of
  positive radii has an infimum that may be $0$, and then no positive $\delta$
  survives. That is exactly what happens for the shrinking intervals of
  [[fs-arbitrary-intersection-of-open-is-open]], whose named witness is
  [[cex-intersection-of-shrinking-intervals-not-open]].

- **The four claims are a rewriting of two.** Claims 3 and 4 are claims 1 and 2
  read through complementation, and closedness is *defined* by complementation
  ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), so no separate argument about closed sets is
  possible or needed.

## Statement

Every nonempty subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ has a least element: there is $\ell \in S$ with $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A nonempty subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. Define $T = \{\, n \in \mathbb{N} : \text{every } m \text{ with } m \le n \text{ satisfies } m \notin S \,\}$ (informally, no element of $S$ is $\le n$).

[L1] Induction principle: a subset of $\mathbb{N}$ that contains $0$ and is closed under $\sigma$ equals $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L2] $m < n \iff \sigma(m) \le n$; consequently no $k$ satisfies $n < k < \sigma(n)$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]).

[L3] Exactly one of $s < n$, $s = n$, $n < s$ holds ([[lem-nat-trichotomy]]); and $n < s \iff \sigma(n) \le s$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]).

[L4] $\sigma$ is injective (Peano axiom P2) ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]).

[L5] $\sigma(a) + i = \sigma(a + i)$ for all $a, i$ (the left successor law, [[lem-nat-add-successor-left]]).

[L6] $0 + k = k$ for all $k$ ([[lem-nat-add-identity]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose $S$ is nonempty but has no least element. [assume-contra]

1.2 If $m < \sigma(n)$ then $m \le n$: by [L2] applied to $m$ and $\sigma(n)$ we get $\sigma(m) \le \sigma(n)$, say $\sigma(m) + i = \sigma(n)$; then $\sigma(m + i) = \sigma(m) + i = \sigma(n)$ [L5], so $m + i = n$ by injectivity [L4], hence $m \le n$. [L2, L4, L5]

2.1 First, $0 \in T$: if $0 \in S$ then $0 \le s$ for all $s \in S$, since $0 + s = s$ [L6], making $0$ a least element, contrary to the assumption; hence $0 \notin S$; moreover $m \le 0$ forces $m = 0$, because $m \ne 0$ would give $0 < m$ (as $0 + m = m$ [L6] with $m \ne 0$) while $m \le 0$ gives $m < 0$, and [L3] admits at most one of these; so every $m \le 0$ lies outside $S$. [step 1.1, L3, L6, given]

2.2 Next, $T$ is closed under $\sigma$: assume $n \in T$; if $\sigma(n) \in S$ then no $s \in S$ satisfies $s < \sigma(n)$ (else $s \le n$ by step 1.2, so $s \notin S$ because $n \in T$, a contradiction), hence $\sigma(n) \le s$ for all $s \in S$ by [L3], making $\sigma(n)$ a least element, contrary to the assumption; therefore $\sigma(n) \notin S$, and any $m$ with $m \le \sigma(n)$ satisfies $m = \sigma(n)$ or $m \ne \sigma(n)$; in the second case $m \le \sigma(n)$ together with $m \ne \sigma(n)$ gives $m < \sigma(n)$ by the definition of the strict order, hence $m \le n$ by step 1.2 and $m \notin S$ because $n \in T$, while in the first case $m = \sigma(n) \notin S$; so every $m \le \sigma(n)$ lies outside $S$, giving $\sigma(n) \in T$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L3]

3.1 By the induction principle [L1], from $0 \in T$ and closure under $\sigma$, $T = \mathbb{N}$; then for every $n$, taking $m = n \le n$ shows $n \notin S$, so $S = \varnothing$, contradicting nonemptiness; therefore $S$ has a least element. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L1, discharge-contradiction] ∎
