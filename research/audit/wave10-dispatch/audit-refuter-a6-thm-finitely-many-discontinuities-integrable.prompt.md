## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` proof, actively search for a counterexample. A false
public claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or
materially inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is
nonfatal.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]). Suppose there are $r \in \mathbb{N}$ and points
$d_0, \dots, d_{r-1} \in [a,b]$ such that $f$ is continuous
([[def-continuity-real]]) at every point of $[a,b]$ other than
$d_0, \dots, d_{r-1}$; that is, every discontinuity of $f$
([[def-classification-of-discontinuities]]) occurs among those $r$ listed
points. Then $f$ is Riemann integrable on $[a,b]$ ([[def-darboux-integral]]).

For $r = 0$ the hypothesis says $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and the conclusion
is [[thm-continuous-implies-integrable]]; the argument below covers that case
without a separate treatment. Repetitions in the list are allowed and harmless,
and no claim is made that the listed points **are** discontinuities: the
hypothesis is one-sided, so a finite superset of the discontinuity set is enough.

**Nothing is said about the kind of the discontinuities.** They may be
removable, jumps, or essential ([[def-classification-of-discontinuities]]); only
their number matters. Boundedness is a genuine hypothesis, since an unbounded
function has no Darboux sums at all ([[def-darboux-sums]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$; a bounded $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$; a real $M_{+} > 0$ with $|f(x)| \le M_{+}$ for every $x \in [a,b]$; and $r \in \mathbb{N}$ with points $d_0, \dots, d_{r-1} \in [a,b]$ such that $f$ is continuous at every $x \in [a,b]$ with $x \ne d_k$ for all $k < r$.

[L1] For a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[a,b]$: $n \ge 1$, $\Delta_i = t_{i+1}-t_i > 0$, $\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = b-a$, $\Delta_i \le \|P\|$, no $t_j$ with $j \le n$ lies strictly between $t_i$ and $t_{i+1}$, inserting a point does not increase the mesh and adds that point to $\operatorname{pts}(P)$, and the uniform partition $U_N$ has mesh $(b-a)/\iota(N)$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L2] $U(f,P) - L(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}(M_i-m_i)\Delta_i$, $M_i - m_i = \sup\{|f(x)-f(y)| : x,y \in I_i\}$, and $0 \le M_i - m_i \le 2M_{+}$ ([[def-darboux-sums]]).

[L3] Riemann's criterion: a bounded $f$ is integrable if and only if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a partition $P$ with $U(f,P)-L(f,P) < \varepsilon$ ([[thm-riemann-criterion]]).

[L4] A closed bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is compact, and a continuous real function on a compact subset $K$ of $\mathbb{R}$ is uniformly continuous on $K$: for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ with $|g(x)-g(y)| < \eta$ for all $x,y \in K$ with $|x-y| < \delta$. This holds for $K = \varnothing$ as well, the condition being vacuous there ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]], [[thm-heine-cantor-r]], [[def-uniform-continuity-real]]).

[L5] Every open interval is an open set, an arbitrary union of open sets is open, a complement of an open set is closed, an intersection of closed sets is closed, and $[a,b]$ is closed and bounded ([[def-interval]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L6] For $u < v$ the endpoints $u$ and $v$ are adherent to $(u,v)$, so every closed set containing $(u,v)$ contains $[u,v]$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L7] If $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c \in A$ and $c \in B \subseteq A$, then the restriction $g|_B$ is continuous at $c$ as a function on $B$: the same $\delta$ works, the condition quantifying over fewer points ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L8] Finite sums: splitting, additivity, scaling, monotonicity in the terms, and telescoping ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]). Also the interchange of two finite sums, $\sum_{i<n}\sum_{k<r}c_{i,k} = \sum_{k<r}\sum_{i<n}c_{i,k}$ for any doubly indexed family of reals. That identity is **not** one of the six clauses of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] and is therefore proved here, by induction on $r$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]). At $r = 0$ each inner sum $\sum_{k<0}c_{i,k}$ is $0$ by the recursion clause of [[def-finite-sum]], so the left side is $\sum_{i<n}0 = 0$ by clause 2 of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] taken with $\lambda = 0$, while the right side is an empty sum and so is $0$ as well. Passing from $r$ to $r+1$, the recursion clause and clause 1 of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] give $\sum_{i<n}\sum_{k<r+1}c_{i,k} = \sum_{i<n}\bigl(\sum_{k<r}c_{i,k} + c_{i,r}\bigr) = \sum_{i<n}\sum_{k<r}c_{i,k} + \sum_{i<n}c_{i,r}$, which by the induction hypothesis is $\sum_{k<r}\sum_{i<n}c_{i,k} + \sum_{i<n}c_{i,r} = \sum_{k<r+1}\sum_{i<n}c_{i,k}$, again by the recursion clause. Note that $n$ is fixed throughout the induction and only $r$ varies.

[L9] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L10] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N) < \eta$; $\iota(N) > 0$ for $N \ge 1$ and $\iota(r) \ge 0$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L11] Ordered-field arithmetic and the absolute value: adding a constant and multiplying by a positive quantity preserve an inequality; the order is total and transitive; $x,y \in [c,d]$ gives $|x-y| \le d-c$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-interval]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. Put $\theta := \varepsilon \cdot \bigl(4(b-a)\bigr)^{-1}$ and $\eta := \varepsilon \cdot \bigl(16\,M_{+}(\iota(r)+1)\bigr)^{-1}$, both positive reals by [L10] and [L11]. [given, L10, L11]

2.1 Put $V := \bigcup_{k<r}\,(d_k - \eta,\ d_k + \eta)$, an open set by [L5], and $K := [a,b] \setminus V = [a,b] \cap (\mathbb{R}\setminus V)$, an intersection of two closed sets, hence closed by [L5], and bounded since $K \subseteq [a,b]$; so $K$ is compact by [L4]. [step 1.1, L4, L5, construct]

3.1 $f$ is continuous at every point of $K$: a point $x \in K$ is not any $d_k$, since $d_k \in (d_k-\eta, d_k+\eta) \subseteq V$ and $K$ misses $V$. Hence the restriction $f|_K$ is continuous on $K$ by [L7]. [step 2.1, given, L7, L11]

4.1 By [L4] applied to $f|_K$ on the compact set $K$ with the value $\theta$, fix a real $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(x)-f(y)| < \theta$ for all $x,y \in K$ with $|x-y| < \delta$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L4, choose]

5.1 By [L10] fix a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N) < \delta \cdot (b-a)^{-1}$, so that the uniform partition $U_N$ has mesh $(b-a)/\iota(N) < \delta$ by [L1] and [L11]. Let $P = (n,t)$ be the partition obtained from $U_N$ by inserting, one after another, those of the $2r$ points $d_k - \eta$ and $d_k + \eta$ with $k < r$ that lie in $[a,b]$. By [L1] each insertion leaves the mesh no larger, so $\|P\| < \delta$, and $\operatorname{pts}(P)$ contains every one of those points that lies in $[a,b]$. [step 4.1, L1, L10, L11, choose, construct]

6.1 **A dichotomy for each subinterval and each $k$.** Fix $i < n$ and $k < r$, and write $c^{-} := d_k - \eta$ and $c^{+} := d_k + \eta$. Neither $c^{-}$ nor $c^{+}$ lies in the open interval $(t_i,t_{i+1})$: if such a point lies in $[a,b]$ it is a member of $\operatorname{pts}(P)$ by step 5.1, hence is some $t_j$ with $j \le n$, and no $t_j$ lies strictly between $t_i$ and $t_{i+1}$ by [L1]; and if it lies outside $[a,b]$ it is outside $[t_i,t_{i+1}]$ altogether. [step 5.1, L1, L11]

7.1 Consequently either $(t_i,t_{i+1}) \cap (c^{-},c^{+}) = \varnothing$, or $I_i \subseteq [c^{-},c^{+}]$. Suppose the intersection contains a point $z$ and let $w \in (t_i,t_{i+1})$. If $w \le c^{-}$ then $c^{-}$ lies between $w$ and $z$, both in the order-convex set $(t_i,t_{i+1})$, so $c^{-} \in (t_i,t_{i+1})$, contradicting step 6.1; likewise $w \ge c^{+}$ is impossible. So $(t_i,t_{i+1}) \subseteq (c^{-},c^{+})$. Then $c^{-} < z < t_{i+1}$ with $c^{-} \notin (t_i,t_{i+1})$ forces $c^{-} \le t_i$, and symmetrically $c^{+} \ge t_{i+1}$, that is $I_i \subseteq [c^{-},c^{+}]$. [step 6.1, L11, given]

8.1 Call $i < n$ **bad** when $I_i \subseteq [d_k-\eta, d_k+\eta]$ for some $k < r$, and **good** otherwise. If $i$ is good then by step 7.1 the open interval $(t_i,t_{i+1})$ meets no $(d_k-\eta,d_k+\eta)$, hence $(t_i,t_{i+1}) \subseteq K$; since $K$ is closed, [L6] gives $I_i = [t_i,t_{i+1}] \subseteq K$. [step 2.1, step 7.1, L6]

9.1 For a good $i$: all $x,y \in I_i$ lie in $K$ and satisfy $|x-y| \le \Delta_i \le \|P\| < \delta$ by [L1] and [L11], so $|f(x)-f(y)| < \theta$ by step 4.1; therefore $\theta$ bounds the set whose supremum is $M_i - m_i$, and $M_i - m_i \le \theta$ by [L2]. [step 4.1, step 5.1, step 8.1, L1, L2, L11]

9.2 **Bounding the bad lengths.** For $k < r$ put $J_k := \{\, i < n : d_k - \eta \le t_i \text{ and } t_{i+1} \le d_k + \eta \,\}$, so that $i$ is bad exactly when $i \in J_k$ for some $k < r$, and put $h^{k}_i := \Delta_i$ for $i \in J_k$ and $h^{k}_i := 0$ otherwise. Each $J_k$ is a set of consecutive indices: if $i < i' < i''$ with $i, i'' \in J_k$ then $d_k - \eta \le t_i \le t_{i'}$ and $t_{i'+1} \le t_{i''+1} \le d_k + \eta$, so $i' \in J_k$. [step 8.1, L1, L11, construct]

10.1 $\sum_{i<n} h^{k}_i \le 2\eta$ for each $k < r$. If $J_k = \varnothing$ the sum is $0$. Otherwise let $p := \min J_k$ and let $q$ be the least natural with $q > p$ and $q \notin J_k$, which exists by [L9] because $n \notin J_k$; by step 9.2 then $J_k = \{\, i : p \le i < q \,\}$, since an $i \in J_k$ with $i \ge q$ together with $p \in J_k$ and $p < q \le i$ would put $q \in J_k$. Splitting the sum at $p$ and at $q$ and discarding the vanishing outer parts ([L8]) gives $\sum_{i<n}h^{k}_i = \sum_{i=p}^{q-1}\Delta_i = t_q - t_p$ by telescoping, and $p \in J_k$, $q-1 \in J_k$ give $t_p \ge d_k-\eta$ and $t_q \le d_k+\eta$, whence $t_q - t_p \le 2\eta$. [step 9.2, L8, L9, L11]

11.1 Put $\beta_i := \Delta_i$ for $i$ bad and $\beta_i := 0$ for $i$ good. Then $\beta_i \le \sum_{k<r}h^{k}_i$ for every $i < n$, all terms being nonnegative and a bad $i$ lying in some $J_k$; so by [L8], $\sum_{i<n}\beta_i \le \sum_{i<n}\sum_{k<r}h^{k}_i = \sum_{k<r}\sum_{i<n}h^{k}_i \le \sum_{k<r}2\eta = 2\eta\,\iota(r)$, using step 10.1. [step 9.2, step 10.1, L8, L11]

12.1 For every $i < n$ one has $(M_i - m_i)\Delta_i \le \theta\,\Delta_i + 2M_{+}\,\beta_i$: for good $i$ this is step 9.1 together with $\beta_i \ge 0$, and for bad $i$ it follows from $M_i - m_i \le 2M_{+}$ in [L2] and $\beta_i = \Delta_i$, together with $\theta\Delta_i \ge 0$. [step 9.1, step 11.1, L2, L11]

13.1 Summing step 12.1 over $i < n$ and using [L8], [L1] and step 11.1: $U(f,P) - L(f,P) \le \theta\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i + 2M_{+}\sum_{i<n}\beta_i \le \theta(b-a) + 4M_{+}\eta\,\iota(r) \le \varepsilon\cdot 4^{-1} + \varepsilon\cdot 4^{-1} < \varepsilon$, the last estimate because $4M_{+}\eta\,\iota(r) \le 4M_{+}\eta(\iota(r)+1) = \varepsilon\cdot 4^{-1}$ by step 1.1. [step 1.1, step 11.1, step 12.1, L1, L2, L8, L10, L11]

14.1 The real $\varepsilon > 0$ of step 1.1 was arbitrary and step 13.1 produced a partition $P$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$, so [L3] applies and $f$ is Riemann integrable on $[a,b]$. [step 1.1, step 13.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the two budgets go.** The $\varepsilon/4$ of step 13.1 that is spent on the good subintervals buys uniform continuity away from the bad points; the $\varepsilon/4$ spent on the bad ones buys nothing but their total length, and it is affordable only because there are finitely many of them and $\eta$ may be chosen after $r$ is known. Both halves survive verbatim when "finitely many points" is replaced by "a set of measure zero", and that replacement is [[thm-lebesgue-criterion]].

- **The listing form of the hypothesis is deliberate.** Saying "the set of discontinuities is finite" would require a notion of finiteness and a listing theorem to use it; saying "every discontinuity is among $d_0,\dots,d_{r-1}$" is what the proof consumes and is what every application supplies. The same device is used by [[lem-finite-set-has-max]].

- **The result is genuinely weaker than what is true.** Thomae's function has infinitely many discontinuities and is integrable, and so is the indicator of the Cantor set, whose discontinuity set is uncountable. What survives is that a *finite* discontinuity set never obstructs integrability, whatever the function does at those points.

- **Choice.** The proof selects nothing from an infinite family; the only countable choice behind it is the single use inside [[thm-heine-cantor-r]], invoked at step 4.1. See [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].

A set has at most one least element\n([[def-max-min]]), so $t_{i+1} = t'_{i+1}$.\n\nSecond, $n = n'$. If $n < n'$ then $t'_n = t_n = b$ by the previous paragraph,\nwhile $t'_n < t'_{n'} = b$ because $t'$ is increasing on indices $\\le n'$ and\n$n < n'$; that is impossible. Exchanging the roles of $P$ and $P'$ rules out\n$n' < n$. $\\square$\n\nSo the map $P \\mapsto \\operatorname{pts}(P)$ is injective, and a partition may be\nnamed by its point set whenever one is exhibited.\n\n### Inserting a point\n\nLet $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ and let $c \\in [a,b]$. Define a\npartition $P + c$ of $[a,b]$ as follows.\n\n- If $c \\in \\operatorname{pts}(P)$, put $P + c := P$.\n- Otherwise $c \\ne a$ and $c \\ne b$, so $a < c < b$. The set\n  $T := \\{\\, t_i : i \\le n \\text{ and } t_i < c \\,\\}$ is a nonempty finite set of\n  reals, nonempty because $t_0 = a < c$, so it has a maximum\n  ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]); let $i_0 \\le n$ be the unique index with\n  $t_{i_0} = \\max T$, unique because $t$ is injective on indices $\\le n$. Then\n  $i_0 < n$, since $t_n = b > c$ puts $t_n \\notin T$; and\n  $$t_{i_0} \\;<\\; c \\;<\\; t_{i_0+1},$$\n  the right inequality because $t_{i_0+1} \\ne c$ (as $c \\notin \\operatorname{pts}(P)$)\n  and $t_{i_0+1} < c$ would put $t_{i_0+1} \\in T$ with $t_{i_0+1} > t_{i_0} = \\max T$.\n  Put $P + c := (n+1, s)$ with\n  $$s_i := t_i \\ (i \\le i_0), \\qquad s_{i_0+1} := c, \\qquad s_i := t_{i-1} \\ (i_0 + 2 \\le i \\le n+1), \\qquad s_k := b \\ (k \\ge n+1).$$\n\nIn both cases $P + c$ is a partition of $[a,b]$ and\n\n$$\\operatorname{pts}(P + c) \\;=\\; \\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\{c\\}, \\qquad \\|P+c\\| \\;\\le\\; \\|P\\| .$$\n\nThe displayed identity is immediate from the two cases. For the mesh: in the\nfirst case nothing changes; in the second the list of subinterval lengths of\n$P + c$ is that of $P$ with $\\Delta_{i_0}$ replaced by the two numbers\n$c - t_{i_0}$ and $t_{i_0+1} - c$, each of which is smaller than\n$\\Delta_{i_0} = (c - t_{i_0}) + (t_{i_0+1} - c)$ because the other is positive.\nSo every length of $P + c$ is at most a length of $P$, and the maximum cannot\nincrease. Finally the index count grows by exactly $1$ in the second case and\nnot at all in the first.\n\n### Refinement and the common refinement\n\n$P'$ **refines** $P$, and is a **refinement** of $P$, when\n\n$$\\operatorname{pts}(P) \\;\\subseteq\\; \\operatorname{pts}(P') .$$\n\nLet $P = (n,t)$ and $Q = (m,s)$ be partitions of $[a,b]$. Applying the recursion\ntheorem ([[thm-recursion]]) to the set $\\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$,\nwhere $\\mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$ is the set of partitions of $[a,b]$, with starting\nelement $(0, P)$ and the map $(j, R) \\mapsto (j+1,\\ R + s_j)$ — legitimate\nbecause $s_j \\in [a,b]$ for every $j \\in \\mathbb{N}$ — gives a unique family\n$(R_j)_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ of partitions with $R_0 = P$ and $R_{j+1} = R_j + s_j$.\nThe **common refinement** of $P$ and $Q$ is\n\n$$P \\vee Q \\;:=\\; R_{m+1} .$$\n\n**Its point set is the union.** By induction on $j$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]),\n$\\operatorname{pts}(R_j) = \\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\{\\, s_l : l < j \\,\\}$;\ntaking $j = m+1$ gives\n\n$$\\operatorname{pts}(P \\vee Q) \\;=\\; \\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\operatorname{pts}(Q).$$\n\nHence $P \\vee Q$ refines both $P$ and $Q$; by the uniqueness claim above it is\nthe **only** partition with that point set, so $P \\vee Q = Q \\vee P$, and\n\n$$P' \\text{ refines } P \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad P \\vee P' = P' ,$$\n\nsince then $\\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\operatorname{pts}(P') =\n\\operatorname{pts}(P')$.\n\n**Two size bounds, both used later.** Writing $n_R$ for the first component of a\npartition $R$:\n\n$$\\|P \\vee Q\\| \\;\\le\\; \\|P\\|, \\qquad n_{P \\vee Q} \\;\\le\\; n_P + n_Q - 1 .$$\n\nThe first is the mesh bound above applied $m+1$ times. For the second, each\ninsertion raises the index count by at most $1$, and the two insertions of\n$s_0 = a$ and $s_m = b$ raise it by $0$, since $a$ and $b$ already lie in\n$\\operatorname{pts}(P)$ and hence in $\\operatorname{pts}(R_j)$ for every $j$; so\nat most $m - 1$ of the $m+1$ insertions increase it.\n\n### The index map of a refinement\n\nLet $P' = (n',t')$ refine $P = (n,t)$. For each $i \\le n$ the point $t_i$ lies in\n$\\operatorname{pts}(P')$, so there is exactly one $\\varphi(i) \\le n'$ with\n$t'_{\\varphi(i)} = t_i$, uniqueness because $t'$ is injective on indices $\\le n'$.\nThe resulting map $\\varphi$ satisfies\n\n$$\\varphi(0) = 0, \\qquad \\varphi(n) = n', \\qquad \\varphi(i) < \\varphi(i+1) \\ \\ (i < n),$$\n\nthe first two because $t'_0 = a = t_0$ and $t'_{n'} = b = t_n$ together with\ninjectivity, and the third because $t_i < t_{i+1}$ and $t'$ is increasing on\nindices $\\le n'$. In particular $n \\le n'$. Moreover, for $i < n$ and\n$\\varphi(i) \\le j < \\varphi(i+1)$,\n\n$$I'_j \\;=\\; [\\,t'_j,\\ t'_{j+1}\\,] \\;\\subseteq\\; [\\,t_i,\\ t_{i+1}\\,] \\;=\\; I_i ,$$\n\nbecause $t_i = t'_{\\varphi(i)} \\le t'_j$ and $t'_{j+1} \\le t'_{\\varphi(i+1)} = t_{i+1}$.\n\n**The blocks are counted by telescoping.** By clause 5 of\n[[lem-finite-sum-laws]],\n$\\sum_{i<n}\\big(\\varphi(i+1) - \\varphi(i)\\big) = \\varphi(n) - \\varphi(0) = n'$,\nso, subtracting $\\sum_{i<n} 1 = n$,\n\n$$\\sum_{i<n} \\big(\\varphi(i+1) - \\varphi(i) - 1\\big) \\;=\\; n' - n ,$$\n\na sum of $n$ nonnegative integers, one for each block, which vanishes exactly at\nthe blocks consisting of a single index.

It is not a condition relating $f$ to points outside $A$.\n\nEvery point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$,\nand never both ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so clauses 1 and 2 between them describe\ncontinuity at every point of $A$.\n\n**This is not the raw $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ formula of\n[[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]].** That item records what goes\nwrong when the *punctured* formula of [[def-function-limit]] is written down at\nan arbitrary point of the domain: at an isolated point it is satisfied\nvacuously by every real $L$ at once, so it defines nothing, and this library\ntherefore leaves $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x)$ **undefined** at an isolated point.\nContinuity at an isolated point is a different matter: the formula above is not\nvacuous — it is a genuine condition on $f(c)$, satisfied because $f(c)$ is the\nonly value being compared with itself — and it names a single, well-defined\nproperty. The limit is undefined there; the continuity is defined, and is\nautomatic. Clause 1 is the only place where the two notions meet, and it is\nstated only where the limit exists as a notion.\n\n**Where the distinction disappears.** If $A$ is an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}$\n([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), then every $c \\in A$ has some\n$N_{\\eta}(c) \\subseteq A$, and a punctured neighbourhood is never empty\n([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), so every point of $A$ is a limit point of $A$ and\nclause 1 covers the whole of $A$. The same holds when $A$ is a nondegenerate\ninterval ([[def-interval]]). Isolated points are what force clause 2 to exist at\nall, and they occur as soon as $A$ is allowed to be an arbitrary subset of\n$\\mathbb{R}$, as in $A = \\{0\\} \\cup [1,2]$.",

It is the singleton $\\{a\\}$ when $a = b$.\n- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each\n  is nondegenerate.\n\nThe only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is\nthat $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because\n$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to\nboth sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside\n$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.\n\n**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \\le b$, which is\nexactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested\ninterval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always\ncarries the hypothesis $a \\le b$ in this library.\n\n**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints\n$a \\le b$ is\n\n$$\\ell = b - a \\;\\ge\\; 0 .$$\n\nLength is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the\nset: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is\n$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so\nnothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every\npoint where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.\nUnbounded intervals are assigned no length.",

## Statement

Let $F$ be a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and let
$\varepsilon \in F$ with $\varepsilon > 0$. Then there is a natural number
$n \ge 1$ such that

$$\frac{1}{n \cdot 1_F} < \varepsilon ,$$

where $n \cdot 1_F$ is the canonical natural of $F$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]]) and
$1/(n \cdot 1_F)$ is its multiplicative inverse ([[def-field]]). As is standard
we abbreviate $n \cdot 1_F$ to $n$ and write the conclusion $1/n < \varepsilon$.

This is the **reciprocal form** of the Archimedean property.
[[thm-of-archimedean]] on its own delivers only the assertion that the canonical
naturals are cofinal, $x < n \cdot 1_F$; the form actually used in analysis, that
the reciprocals of the naturals get below every positive bound, is the statement
above, and it is recorded separately so that no proof has to reconstruct the
inversion step in passing.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $F$ and an element $\varepsilon \in F$ with $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] Archimedean property: for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Inverses and order: if $a > 0$ then $a^{-1} > 0$, and if $0 < a < b$ then $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Field arithmetic: an element $a$ with $a > 0$ is nonzero by trichotomy, hence has a multiplicative inverse $a^{-1}$, and $(a^{-1})^{-1} = a$ ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Since $\varepsilon > 0$, trichotomy gives $\varepsilon \ne 0$, so $\varepsilon^{-1}$ exists, and $\varepsilon^{-1} > 0$. [given, L2, L3]

2.1 Apply [L1] to $x = \varepsilon^{-1}$: fix a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $\varepsilon^{-1} < n \cdot 1_F$. [step 1.1, L1, choose]

3.1 Chaining the two displayed inequalities gives $0 < \varepsilon^{-1} < n \cdot 1_F$; in particular $n \cdot 1_F > 0$, so $n \cdot 1_F \ne 0$ and $1/(n \cdot 1_F)$ is defined. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L3]

4.1 Apply the second claim of [L2] with $a = \varepsilon^{-1}$ and $b = n \cdot 1_F$: $0 < (n \cdot 1_F)^{-1} < (\varepsilon^{-1})^{-1}$. [step 3.1, L2]

5.1 By [L3], $(\varepsilon^{-1})^{-1} = \varepsilon$, so the natural number $n \ge 1$ fixed in step 2.1 satisfies $1/(n \cdot 1_F) < \varepsilon$, which is the assertion. [step 4.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Monotonicity gives the eventual form for free.** If $m \ge n \ge 1$ then
  $m \cdot 1_F \ge n \cdot 1_F > 0$, because $k \mapsto k \cdot 1_F$ is strictly
  increasing on the naturals $\ge 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]), and so
  $1/(m \cdot 1_F) \le 1/(n \cdot 1_F) < \varepsilon$ by [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]
  again. So the corollary yields not merely one index but a threshold: every
  $m \ge n$ satisfies $1/m < \varepsilon$. That one extra line is what a
  convergence proof needs, and it is left to the caller rather than folded into
  the statement, because the caller usually has a threshold of its own to combine
  it with.

- **Completeness is used only through [[thm-of-archimedean]].** Nothing here
  needs the least-upper-bound property directly. The corollary therefore holds
  verbatim in any Archimedean ordered field, in particular in $\mathbb{Q}$, and
  it fails in a non-Archimedean ordered field, where an infinitesimal
  $\varepsilon > 0$ is below every $1/n$ by construction.

- The equivalence is exact: the reciprocal form implies the cofinal form back
  again, since given $x > 0$ one applies it to $\varepsilon = 1/x$. The two are
  the same property written on the two sides of the inversion, and only the
  direction proved above is used in this library.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ denotes the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a subset of it.

The notions **upper bound** and **bounded above** are already fixed by
[[def-complete-ordered-field]] and are only recalled here, never redefined:
$u \in \mathbb{R}$ is an *upper bound* of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$, and
$S$ is *bounded above* if it has at least one upper bound. The dual notions are:

- $\ell \in \mathbb{R}$ is a **lower bound** of $S$ if $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.
- $S$ is **bounded below** if it has at least one lower bound.
- $S$ is **bounded** if it is both bounded above and bounded below, that is, if
  there are $\ell, u \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\ell \le s \le u$ for every $s \in S$.

## Remarks

- A bound is an element of $\mathbb{R}$ and is not required to lie in $S$. A
  bound that does lie in $S$ is a maximum or a minimum ([[def-max-min]]), and
  that is a strictly stronger condition ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Bounds come in half-lines: if $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$ then so is every
  $\ell'' \le \ell$, and if $u$ is an upper bound then so is every $u'' \ge u$.
  Consequently a set that has one bound of a given kind has infinitely many, and
  the interesting question is whether the collection of them has a best element,
  which is what a supremum ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) or an infimum
  ([[def-infimum]]) is.
- Bounded above and bounded below are independent conditions. The set
  $A = \{\, n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} : n \ge 1 \,\}$ of canonical naturals of
  $\mathbb{R}$ is bounded below by $0$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]) and is not
  bounded above ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); its reflection $-A$ is bounded above
  and not bounded below ([[lem-reflection]]).
- The empty set is bounded, and vacuously so: every real number is both an upper
  bound and a lower bound of $\emptyset$, since the defining condition quantifies
  over no elements. Having bounds is therefore much weaker than having a least
  upper bound or a greatest lower bound ([[fs-every-set-has-sup]]).

## Definition

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]) with additive identity $0_F$ and
multiplicative identity $1_F$. Define
$\iota : \mathbb{N} \to F$ by recursion on $\mathbb{N}$
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[thm-recursion]]):

$$\iota(0) \;:=\; 0_F, \qquad \iota(n+1) \;:=\; \iota(n) + 1_F .$$

$\iota(n)$ is the **canonical natural** of $n$ in $F$. It is also written
$n \cdot 1_F$, and for $n \ge 1$ it is $1_F$ added to itself $n$ times.

**Why the notation is needed at all.** A natural number in this library is a von
Neumann natural, that is a set ([[def-natural-numbers]]), and a set is not an
element of $F$. So $1/n$, $n^{\alpha}$ and $x/n$ are not expressions of $F$ when
$n$ is a natural: what they mean is $1/\iota(n)$, $\iota(n)^{\alpha}$ and
$x/\iota(n)$. The map $\iota$ is what carries a counting number into the field,
and writing it is the whole reason a reader meets $1/\iota(k+1)$ where an
informal text would write $1/(k+1)$.

## Remarks

- **Where the index shift comes from.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
  ([[def-natural-numbers]]) and $\iota(0) = 0_F$, so $1/\iota(k)$ is undefined at
  $k = 0$. A family of reciprocals indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ is therefore written
  over $\iota(k+1)$, which is why the harmonic and telescoping families of this
  library run over $k+1$ rather than over $k$. This is bookkeeping, not a
  restriction: the values are the usual ones.

- **This definition records notation; the arithmetic is proved elsewhere.** That
  $\iota$ is strictly increasing and positive on $n \ge 1$, and that it carries
  sums to sums and products to products, is [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], stated
  for an ordered field. That lemma introduces the same element by the equivalent
  recursion $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, which
  agrees with the definition above because $\iota(1) = \iota(0) + 1_F = 1_F$.
  Nothing here is new mathematics; the definition exists so that the notation has
  a home a reader can look up.

- **The symbol $\iota$ is used in this library for other canonical maps, and this
  definition does not govern them.** It also denotes the canonical field
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to F$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), the isometric
  embedding of a metric space into a completion ([[def-metric-completion]]), and
  an inclusion map $\iota : S \to X$ of a subspace. Each of those is introduced
  where it is used and means something different from the map defined here. What
  the four share is only that each is the canonical map of its situation.

- **Fields, not just ordered fields.** The recursion needs no order, so the
  definition is stated for a field; every use in this library is in an ordered
  field, and the order is what makes $\iota$ injective
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). In a field of positive characteristic $\iota$
  is not injective, which is one reason the injectivity is a lemma rather than
  part of the definition.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Then
$f$ is **discontinuous at $c$**, and $c$ is a **discontinuity of $f$**, when $f$
is not continuous at $c$ ([[def-continuity-real]]). As in
[[def-one-sided-limits]] write

$$A^{-} := A \cap (-\infty, c), \qquad A^{+} := A \cap (c, \infty)$$

([[def-interval]]), and recall that $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x)$ is defined only
when $c$ is a limit point of $A^{-}$, and $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$ only when
$c$ is a limit point of $A^{+}$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]).

**At an isolated point there is nothing to classify.** If $c$ is an isolated
point of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so that $A \cap N_{\rho}(c) = \{c\}$ for
some real $\rho > 0$, then $f$ is continuous at $c$: the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$
condition of [[def-continuity-real]] is satisfied by $\delta := \rho$, since the
only $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \rho$ is $c$ itself and $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0$. So
every discontinuity is a limit point of $A$, and the classification below covers
every case that occurs.

### Two-sided points

Suppose $c$ is a limit point of **both** $A^{-}$ and $A^{+}$, so that both
one-sided limits are well posed. Say that $c$ is a discontinuity

- **of the first kind** when both one-sided limits exist;
- **of the second kind**, also called **essential**, when at least one of the two
  one-sided limits fails to exist.

A discontinuity of the first kind is further

- **removable** when $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) = \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$; the
  common value is then different from $f(c)$, for otherwise
  [[thm-two-sided-limit-iff-both-one-sided]] would give
  $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$ and $f$ would be continuous at $c$
  ([[def-continuity-real]]);
- a **jump** when $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) \ne \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$; the
  difference $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x) - \lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x)$ is then called
  the **jump of $f$ at $c$**.

The three cases *removable*, *jump*, *essential* are mutually exclusive and
exhaust the two-sided discontinuities of $f$: either both one-sided limits
exist, and then they are equal or not, or one of them does not exist.

**Removable is a name for what can be repaired.** If $c$ is a removable
discontinuity with common one-sided value $L$, then the function agreeing with
$f$ off $c$ and taking the value $L$ at $c$ is continuous at $c$, again by
[[thm-two-sided-limit-iff-both-one-sided]] and [[def-continuity-real]]: changing
the single value $f(c)$ removes the discontinuity. No such repair is available at
a jump or at an essential discontinuity, since there the two-sided limit does not
exist at all and no choice of value at $c$ can create it.

### One-sided points

If $c$ is a limit point of exactly one of $A^{-}$ and $A^{+}$, only that side is
defined and only that side is used: $c$ is a discontinuity **of the first kind**
when the one-sided limit on the side in question exists, and **of the second
kind** otherwise. When it exists it is different from $f(c)$, since on such a
point the one-sided condition and the continuity condition are the same
condition; and there is no jump case, there being nothing to compare the value
with. The endpoints of an interval are the typical instance.

**On the two vocabularies.** *First kind* and *second kind* are Rudin's terms and
are recorded because the literature uses them; *removable*, *jump* and
*essential* are the names used in the rest of this library. They name the same
three cases and no third classification is introduced.

## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq F$.

- $u \in F$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$; $S$ is
  **bounded above** if it has an upper bound.
- $u \in F$ is a **least upper bound** (or **supremum**, $\sup S$) of $S$ if $u$
  is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le u'$ for every upper bound $u'$ of $S$.

$F$ is a **complete ordered field** (equivalently, $F$ has the
**least-upper-bound property**, or is **Dedekind complete**) if every nonempty
$S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$.

## Remarks

- A least upper bound, if it exists, is unique (two least upper bounds are each
  $\le$ the other, so equal by antisymmetry of the order).
- Applying the property to $\{-s : s \in S\}$ yields the dual **greatest lower
  bound** (infimum) property, so the two are equivalent.
- The Dedekind-cut reals have this property by construction
  ([[thm-dedekind-complete]]); the Cauchy-sequence reals acquire it via
  [[cor-cauchy-reals-lub-complete]]. This definition is the target for the
  uniqueness theorem [[thm-uniqueness-complete-ordered-field]].

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field with its order and
absolute value ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]), and
neighbourhoods are those of [[def-neighbourhood-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Then
$f$ is **continuous at $c$** when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

with $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ ranging over the **positive reals**. In the
language of neighbourhoods: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ with

$$f\bigl(A \cap N_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \;\subseteq\; N_{\varepsilon}\bigl(f(c)\bigr).$$

$f$ is **continuous on $A$** when it is continuous at every point of $A$.

**The point $c$ is required to lie in $A$, and the condition is unpunctured.**
Both differ from [[def-function-limit]], and deliberately. There the quantifier
runs over $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, which removes $x = c$; here $x = c$ is allowed,
and at $x = c$ the implication reads $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$, which is
automatic. So allowing $x = c$ costs nothing, and it is what lets the definition
be stated at every point of $A$, including the points where no limit exists.

**Three clauses, and all three are part of the definition.**

1. **At a limit point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is a limit point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]). Then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if the
   limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) \;=\; f(c)$$
   ([[def-function-limit]]). Indeed, for a given $\varepsilon > 0$ a $\delta$
   witnessing continuity witnesses the limit condition, because the limit
   condition quantifies over a subset of the points continuity quantifies over;
   and conversely a $\delta$ witnessing $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$ witnesses
   continuity, because the one point it omits, $x = c$, satisfies
   $|f(c) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ anyway.

2. **At an isolated point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is an isolated point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so that $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ for some real
   $\eta > 0$. Then **every** $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$: take
   $\delta := \eta$, so that the only $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ is $c$
   itself, and $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$.

3. **On a set.** Continuity on $A$ is continuity at each point of $A$, and
   nothing more. It is not a condition relating $f$ to points outside $A$.

Every point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$,
and never both ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so clauses 1 and 2 between them describe
continuity at every point of $A$.

**This is not the raw $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula of
[[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]].** That item records what goes
wrong when the *punctured* formula of [[def-function-limit]] is written down at
an arbitrary point of the domain: at an isolated point it is satisfied
vacuously by every real $L$ at once, so it defines nothing, and this library
therefore leaves $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ **undefined** at an isolated point.
Continuity at an isolated point is a different matter: the formula above is not
vacuous — it is a genuine condition on $f(c)$, satisfied because $f(c)$ is the
only value being compared with itself — and it names a single, well-defined
property. The limit is undefined there; the continuity is defined, and is
automatic. Clause 1 is the only place where the two notions meet, and it is
stated only where the limit exists as a notion.

**Where the distinction disappears.** If $A$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), then every $c \in A$ has some
$N_{\eta}(c) \subseteq A$, and a punctured neighbourhood is never empty
([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), so every point of $A$ is a limit point of $A$ and
clause 1 covers the whole of $A$. The same holds when $A$ is a nondegenerate
interval ([[def-interval]]). Isolated points are what force clause 2 to exist at
all, and they occur as soon as $A$ is allowed to be an arbitrary subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, as in $A = \{0\} \cup [1,2]$.

## Remarks

- **Continuity is local.** If $\eta > 0$ and $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agrees with
  $f$ on $A \cap N_{\eta}(c)$, then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if $g$
  is: any $\delta$ may be replaced by $\min\{\delta, \eta\}$, after which the
  condition only ever evaluates the two functions where they agree. So
  continuity at $c$ sees only an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of $c$, exactly
  as the limit does ([[lem-limit-is-local]]).

- **Continuity passes to subsets of the domain.** If $B \subseteq A$ and
  $c \in B$, then continuity of $f$ at $c$ gives continuity of the restriction
  $f|_B$ at $c$, with the same $\delta$: the condition on $f|_B$ quantifies over
  fewer points. The converse fails, and the standard witness is the indicator of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ restricted to $\mathbb{Q}$, which is constant and hence
  continuous, while the indicator itself is continuous nowhere
  ([[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]]).

- **The radius is a real number.** As in [[def-neighbourhood-r]], $\varepsilon$
  and $\delta$ range over the positive reals here. Restricting either quantifier
  to the positive rationals defines the same relation, by the passage recorded
  in [[def-function-limit]]: below every positive real lies a positive rational
  ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and a real $\delta$ may be shrunk to a rational
  one below it.

- **The word *continuous* is used for two things in this library, and they
  agree.** [[def-metric-continuity]] defines continuity of a map between metric
  spaces, and $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ carries the metric $d(x,y) = |x-y|$. The
  two notions coincide, and that is proved, not assumed:
  [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]] is the dictionary, and it is stated on
  this page precisely so that no later item has to guess.

## Definition

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]). Write $\mathcal{P}$ for the set of all partitions of
$[a,b]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]) and put

$$\mathcal{L} \;:=\; \{\, L(f,P) \ : \ P \in \mathcal{P} \,\}, \qquad \mathcal{U} \;:=\; \{\, U(f,P) \ : \ P \in \mathcal{P} \,\}$$

for the sets of lower and of upper Darboux sums ([[def-darboux-sums]]).

### Both extrema exist

**$\mathcal{P}$ is nonempty**: the pair $(1, t)$ with $t_0 := a$ and $t_k := b$
for $k \ge 1$ is a partition of $[a,b]$, since $a < b$. So $\mathcal{L}$ and
$\mathcal{U}$ are nonempty.

**$\mathcal{L}$ is bounded above and $\mathcal{U}$ is bounded below.** Fix any
$Q \in \mathcal{P}$. By claim 2 of [[lem-refinement-inequalities]],
$L(f,P) \le U(f,Q)$ for every $P \in \mathcal{P}$, so $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound
of $\mathcal{L}$; and $L(f,Q) \le U(f,P)$ for every $P$, so $L(f,Q)$ is a lower
bound of $\mathcal{U}$.

Hence a nonempty set bounded above has a supremum
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and a nonempty set bounded below has an infimum
([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]), each unique ([[lem-sup-unique]]).
The **lower** and **upper Darboux integrals** of $f$ over $[a,b]$ are the real
numbers

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;:=\; \sup \mathcal{L} \;=\; \sup_{P} L(f,P), \qquad \overline{\int_a^b} f \;:=\; \inf \mathcal{U} \;=\; \inf_{P} U(f,P) .$$

### The lower integral never exceeds the upper one

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f .$$

Indeed, for each fixed $Q \in \mathcal{P}$ the number $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound
of $\mathcal{L}$, so the least upper bound satisfies
$\underline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,Q)$. As $Q$ was arbitrary, $\underline{\int_a^b}f$
is a lower bound of $\mathcal{U}$, and the greatest lower bound satisfies
$\underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f$ ([[def-infimum]]).

Moreover, for **every** partition $P$,

$$L(f,P) \;\le\; \underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; U(f,P) ,$$

the outer inequalities because a member of a set is at most its supremum and at
least its infimum.

### Integrability

$f$ is **Darboux integrable on $[a,b]$**, and on this page simply
**integrable**, when

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;=\; \overline{\int_a^b} f ,$$

and then the common value is written

$$\int_a^b f \qquad \text{or} \qquad \int_a^b f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x ,$$

the **integral of $f$ over $[a,b]$**. It is a single well-determined real
number, being the common value of two numbers each of which is unique
([[lem-sup-unique]]). Without the displayed equality the symbol $\int_a^b f$ is
not defined and is never written.

**The inequality above is the whole difficulty.** By the previous paragraph
integrability is *never* a question of one integral exceeding the other, only of
the gap $\overline{\int_a^b} f - \underline{\int_a^b} f \ge 0$ being $0$; and by
[[thm-riemann-criterion]] that gap is $0$ exactly when a single partition can be
found making $U(f,P) - L(f,P)$ small. Whether that is possible is settled
completely, in terms of the discontinuities of $f$, by
[[thm-lebesgue-criterion]].

**"Riemann integrable" means the same thing here.** The definition above is
Darboux's. Riemann's own definition, in terms of tagged partitions of small
mesh, is [[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]], and the two define the same
class of functions with the same integral by [[thm-darboux-equals-riemann]].
Until that theorem is proved the two phrases are kept apart; after it they are
used interchangeably, as they are throughout the literature.

## Remarks

- **The supremum is over all partitions, and nothing is selected.** Both
  $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{U}$ are sets determined by $f$ and $[a,b]$ alone,
  and $\sup$ and $\inf$ are canonical, so no choice principle is involved in
  forming either integral. Where a choice does enter on this page is recorded in
  [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].

- **Why the lower integral is a supremum and not an infimum.** Refining a
  partition can only increase a lower sum and decrease an upper sum
  ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]]), so the lower sums push up towards the
  integral and the upper sums push down towards it. Taking $\inf \mathcal{L}$
  would return the sum over the coarsest partition and would carry no
  information about $f$ beyond its infimum on $[a,b]$.

- **A bounded $f$ always has both integrals; only their equality can fail.** The
  Dirichlet function on $[0,1]$ has lower integral $0$ and upper integral $1$
  ([[fs-bounded-implies-riemann-integrable]]), which is the standard witness that
  the definition above is not vacuous in either direction.

## Definition

Let $a < b$ be reals, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be **bounded**
([[def-bounded-set]]), so that there is a real $M \ge 0$ with $|f(x)| \le M$ for
every $x \in [a,b]$, and let $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ with
subintervals $I_i = [t_i, t_{i+1}]$ and lengths $\Delta_i = t_{i+1} - t_i$ for
$i < n$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

### The two extreme values on a subinterval

For $i < n$ put

$$m_i \;:=\; \inf f[I_i], \qquad M_i \;:=\; \sup f[I_i], \qquad f[I_i] \;=\; \{\, f(x) : x \in I_i \,\} .$$

**Both exist.** The set $f[I_i]$ is nonempty, because $t_i < t_{i+1}$ makes $I_i$
nonempty ([[def-interval]]), and it is bounded, because $|f(x)| \le M$ for every
$x$ ([[def-bounded-set]]). A nonempty set bounded above has a supremum
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and a nonempty set bounded below has an infimum
([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]); each is unique, so the notations
$\inf f[I_i]$ and $\sup f[I_i]$ name single real numbers ([[lem-sup-unique]]).

**They bracket the values, and each other.** For $x \in I_i$,

$$-M \;\le\; m_i \;\le\; f(x) \;\le\; M_i \;\le\; M ,$$

the outer inequalities because $-M$ is a lower bound and $M$ an upper bound of
$f[I_i]$, and the middle ones by the definitions of infimum and supremum. In
particular $m_i \le M_i$ and $M_i - m_i \le 2M$.

The dependence of $m_i$ and $M_i$ on $f$ and on $P$ is suppressed in the
notation, as is customary; where two partitions are in play the sums below carry
the partition and the extreme values are written out.

### The two Darboux sums

$$L(f,P) \;:=\; \sum_{i<n} m_i \,\Delta_i, \qquad U(f,P) \;:=\; \sum_{i<n} M_i \,\Delta_i ,$$

the finite sums of [[def-finite-sum]], indexed by $i \in \mathbb{N}$ with
$i < n$. Both are real numbers, being finite sums of reals, and

$$L(f,P) \;\le\; U(f,P) ,$$

by monotonicity of finite sums, clause 4 of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], since
$m_i \Delta_i \le M_i \Delta_i$ for every $i < n$: multiplying $m_i \le M_i$ by
$\Delta_i > 0$ preserves the inequality ([[def-ordered-field]]).

### The gap on a subinterval is the oscillation there

For every $i < n$,

$$M_i - m_i \;=\; \omega_f(I_i) \;=\; \sup\{\, |f(x) - f(y)| \ : \ x, y \in I_i \,\} ,$$

the oscillation of $f$ on the set $I_i$ ([[def-oscillation]]). The supremum is a
real number here rather than an extended one, because $f$ is bounded
([[def-oscillation]], [[def-extended-reals]]). The identity is proved in two
inequalities.

*The oscillation is at most the gap.* For $x, y \in I_i$ both $f(x)$ and $f(y)$
lie in $[m_i, M_i]$, so $f(x) - f(y) \le M_i - m_i$ and
$f(y) - f(x) \le M_i - m_i$, whence $|f(x) - f(y)| \le M_i - m_i$
([[lem-of-abs-value]]). So $M_i - m_i$ is an upper bound of the set whose
supremum is $\omega_f(I_i)$.

*The gap is at most the oscillation.* Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real. By the
$\varepsilon$-characterisations of the supremum and the infimum
([[lem-sup-epsilon]], [[lem-inf-epsilon]]) there are $x, y \in I_i$ with
$f(x) > M_i - \varepsilon/2$ and $f(y) < m_i + \varepsilon/2$; then

$$|f(x) - f(y)| \;\ge\; f(x) - f(y) \;>\; (M_i - m_i) - \varepsilon ,$$

so $\omega_f(I_i) > (M_i - m_i) - \varepsilon$. As $\varepsilon > 0$ was
arbitrary, $\omega_f(I_i) \ge M_i - m_i$: otherwise
$\varepsilon := (M_i - m_i) - \omega_f(I_i)$ would be positive and give
$\omega_f(I_i) > \omega_f(I_i)$.

This identity is what connects the Darboux machinery to the pointwise
oscillation of [[def-oscillation]], and it is the hinge of
[[thm-lebesgue-criterion]].

## Remarks

- **Boundedness is a hypothesis of the definition, not of the theorems.** Without
  it $f[I_i]$ may fail to have a supremum in $\mathbb{R}$ and $U(f,P)$ is not
  defined at all. Every statement on this page that mentions $L$ or $U$ therefore
  carries "bounded $f$" in its hypotheses, and none of them is a restriction that
  could be lifted: an unbounded function has no Darboux sums to compare.

- **Why the infimum and the supremum, and not a value of $f$.** Replacing $m_i$
  by $f(\xi_i)$ for a point $\xi_i \in I_i$ gives the Riemann sums of
  [[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]], which depend on a choice of points
  and are not extremal. The Darboux sums are canonical functions of $f$ and $P$
  alone, which is what makes the supremum and infimum over all partitions in
  [[def-darboux-integral]] well posed without any selection.

- **The empty sum does not occur.** A partition has $n \ge 1$
  ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]), so $L(f,P)$ and $U(f,P)$ are sums of at
  least one term. The first term is $m_0 \Delta_0$, over the subinterval
  $[a, t_1]$; the indexing starts at $i = 0$ throughout this page.

## Definition

Throughout this page $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), in particular an ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]]) and a field ([[def-field]]), and $\mathbb{N}$ is the set
of natural numbers ([[def-natural-numbers]]) with successor $\sigma(n) = n + 1$
([[def-nat-addition]]).

Let $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a sequence of reals, written $a_k$ for
$a(k)$. **Finite sums and finite products of $a$ are defined by recursion on the
upper index**, which is legitimate because of the recursion theorem
([[thm-recursion]]). That theorem produces a function of one variable, so the
running index has to be carried along inside the value: applying it to the set
$A = \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$, the starting element $(0, 0)$ and the function
$f(n, s) = (\sigma(n),\, s + a_n)$ gives a unique
$g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$ with

$$g(0) = (0, 0), \qquad g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n)) \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Write $g(n) = \big(\pi_1(g(n)),\, \Sigma_n\big)$ for its two coordinates.

**The first coordinate is the index itself, and that is a small induction, not an
observation** ([[thm-induction-principle]]). Indeed $\pi_1(g(0)) = 0$; and if
$\pi_1(g(n)) = n$, then
$g(\sigma(n)) = f\big(\pi_1(g(n)), \Sigma_n\big) = \big(\sigma(\pi_1(g(n))),\, \Sigma_n + a_{\pi_1(g(n))}\big) = \big(\sigma(n),\, \Sigma_n + a_n\big)$,
so $\pi_1(g(\sigma(n))) = \sigma(n)$. By induction $\pi_1(g(n)) = n$ for every
$n \in \mathbb{N}$. Only now may the second coordinate of the two displayed
clauses be read off, and doing so gives

$$\Sigma_0 = 0, \qquad \Sigma_{\sigma(n)} = \Sigma_n + a_n .$$

$\Sigma$ is moreover the **unique** function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with those
two properties: if $\Sigma'$ also has them then $n \mapsto (n, \Sigma'_n)$ satisfies
the two clauses defining $g$, hence equals $g$ by the uniqueness clause of
[[thm-recursion]], so $\Sigma' = \Sigma$.

We write $\sum_{k < n} a_k := \Sigma_n$. The same construction with starting
element $(0, 1)$ and $f(n, p) = (\sigma(n),\, p \cdot a_n)$, with the same
induction on the first coordinate and the same uniqueness argument, gives the
unique $\Pi : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with

$$\Pi_0 = 1, \qquad \Pi_{\sigma(n)} = \Pi_n \cdot a_n ,$$

and we write $\prod_{k < n} a_k := \Pi_n$.

**Notation.** For $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ we abbreviate

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \sum_{k < n+1} a_k, \qquad \prod_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \prod_{k < n+1} a_k,$$

and, for a general lower index $m$ with $m \le n + 1$, writing $d = n + 1 - m$
for the number of terms,

$$\sum_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \sum_{j < d} a_{m+j}, \qquad \prod_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \prod_{j < d} a_{m+j} .$$

When $m = n + 1$ we have $d = 0$ and the sum is **empty**, with value $0$, while
the empty product has value $1$. In the same spirit $\sum_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ is
notation for the empty sum $\Sigma_0 = 0$ and $\prod_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ for the
empty product $\Pi_0 = 1$; the index $-1$ never occurs as an element of
$\mathbb{N}$ and is only a way of writing "no terms".

Only finitely many values of $a$ enter $\sum_{k<n} a_k$, so the notation
$\sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\prod_{k<n} a_k$ is also used for a list
$a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$ of reals given without reference to any extension of the
list to all of $\mathbb{N}$: extend the list by $a_k = 0$ (respectively
$a_k = 1$) for $k \ge n$ and apply the definition above.

## Remarks

- **Why recursion and not "$a_0 + a_1 + \cdots + a_{n-1}$".** The dots are not a
  definition: they presuppose that the displayed pattern determines a value for
  every $n$, which is exactly what the recursion theorem
  ([[thm-recursion]]) supplies, and its uniqueness clause is what makes
  $\sum_{k<n} a_k$ a single well-determined real rather than a family of choices.
  Associativity and commutativity of addition are *not* used in the definition;
  they are used in the laws proved from it ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).
- **Naturals and rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$ (a convention used on the whole
  page).** A natural number $n$ and a rational number $r$ are not literally
  elements of $\mathbb{R}$: they enter $\mathbb{R}$ through the canonical
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$, which is an injective,
  order-preserving field homomorphism ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), restricting on
  positive naturals to $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} = 1_\mathbb{R} + \cdots + 1_\mathbb{R}$
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). Following ordinary practice, and only where no
  confusion is possible, we write $n$ for $\iota(n)$ and $r$ for $\iota(r)$; so,
  for instance, $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k<n} a_k$ means
  $\iota(n)^{-1} \cdot \sum_{k<n} a_k$, which makes sense because
  $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$. Exponents are the one place where the
  identification is deliberately NOT made: in $a^n$ and $a^r$ the exponent stays
  a natural, an integer or a rational ([[def-integer-power]],
  [[def-rational-power]]), never a real.
- The two indexings are related by $\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k = \sum_{k < n+1} a_k$, so
  a statement proved for one is available for the other. Sums over $k < n$ are
  the primitive form here because $\Sigma_0$, the empty sum, is then the base
  case of every induction, and no index outside $\mathbb{N}$ is ever needed.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with open and closed sets as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

- The **interior** of $A$ is the union of all open subsets of $A$:
  $$A^{\circ} \;:=\; \bigcup \{\, U \subseteq \mathbb{R} : U \text{ open and } U \subseteq A \,\}.$$
- The **closure** of $A$ is the intersection of all closed supersets of $A$:
  $$\overline{A} \;:=\; \bigcap \{\, F \subseteq \mathbb{R} : F \text{ closed and } A \subseteq F \,\}.$$
- The **boundary** of $A$ is $\partial A := \overline{A} \setminus A^{\circ}$.
- The **exterior** of $A$ is $\operatorname{ext} A := (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)^{\circ}$.

**Both operators are well defined and deliver what their names claim.** The
family whose union defines $A^{\circ}$ always contains $\varnothing$, and the
family whose intersection defines $\overline{A}$ always contains $\mathbb{R}$,
so the second family is nonempty and both expressions denote subsets of
$\mathbb{R}$ without appeal to any convention about empty unions or
intersections. Moreover:

- $A^{\circ}$ is **open**, being a union of open sets
  ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], claim 1), and $A^{\circ} \subseteq A$, since
  every set in the family is a subset of $A$. It is therefore the **largest**
  open subset of $A$: any open $U \subseteq A$ is a member of the family and so
  $U \subseteq A^{\circ}$.
- $\overline{A}$ is **closed**, being an intersection of a nonempty family of
  closed sets ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], claim 3), and $A \subseteq
  \overline{A}$, since every set in the family contains $A$. It is therefore the
  **smallest** closed superset of $A$: any closed $F \supseteq A$ is a member of
  the family and so $\overline{A} \subseteq F$.

**Pointwise description of the interior.** For $x \in \mathbb{R}$,

$$x \in A^{\circ} \iff \text{there is } \varepsilon > 0 \text{ with } N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A .$$

If $x \in A^{\circ}$ then, $A^{\circ}$ being open and containing $x$, there is
$\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A^{\circ} \subseteq A$.
Conversely if $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A$ then $N_\varepsilon(x)$ is an open
subset of $A$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) containing $x$, hence
$x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A^{\circ}$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

The corresponding pointwise description of the closure is not a definitional
matter and is proved separately, as [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

## Remarks

- **The four sets partition nothing by themselves, but three of them do.** For
  every $A$ the three sets $A^{\circ}$, $\partial A$ and $\operatorname{ext} A$
  are pairwise disjoint with union $\mathbb{R}$. This is not proved here and is
  not used on this page; what is used is only the definitions above and the
  characterisations of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

- **Interior and closure are dual.** Complementation exchanges the two families
  above, since $U$ is open exactly when $\mathbb{R} \setminus U$ is closed, so
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus A^{\circ} = \overline{\mathbb{R} \setminus A}$ and
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A} = (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)^{\circ} =
  \operatorname{ext} A$. The second identity is the reason the exterior is
  usually described as "the complement of the closure".

- **$A$ is open exactly when $A = A^{\circ}$, and closed exactly when
  $A = \overline{A}$.** For the first: $A^{\circ} \subseteq A$ always, and
  $A \subseteq A^{\circ}$ holds exactly when $A$ is one of the open subsets of
  $A$, that is, exactly when $A$ is open. The closure half is the same argument
  read the other way, and it is recorded as a claim of
  [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] because the rest of that theorem needs it.

- **Boundary points may or may not belong to the set.** $\partial (0,1) =
  \partial [0,1] = \{0,1\}$, and the two boundary points lie outside the first
  set and inside the second; the boundary sees only the way the set meets its
  complement, not which side the edge is assigned to.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]) and its absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]).

Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ with
$\varepsilon > 0$. The **$\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\},$$

and the **punctured $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \;=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}.$$

The two descriptions of $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ agree because $|y - x| = 0$ holds
exactly when $y = x$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**A neighbourhood is an open interval.** For every $x$ and every
$\varepsilon > 0$,

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;=\; (x - \varepsilon,\ x + \varepsilon),$$

the interval of [[def-interval]]. Indeed [[lem-of-abs-value]] gives, for
$\varepsilon > 0$, the equivalence $|y - x| < \varepsilon \iff -\varepsilon <
y - x < \varepsilon$, and adding $x$ throughout turns the right-hand side into
$x - \varepsilon < y < x + \varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**The centre lies in its own neighbourhoods.** $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, since
$|x - x| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**Punctured neighbourhoods are never empty.** The element
$y := x + \varepsilon/2$ satisfies $|y - x| = \varepsilon/2$, which is
$> 0$ and $< \varepsilon$, so $y \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$
([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

**Monotonicity in the radius.** If $0 < \delta \le \varepsilon$ then
$N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, because $|y - x| < \delta \le
\varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**Nesting at an interior point.** If $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and
$0 < \delta \le \varepsilon - |y - x|$, then

$$N_\delta(y) \;\subseteq\; N_\varepsilon(x).$$

Indeed for $z \in N_\delta(y)$ the triangle inequality
([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]) gives
$|z - x| = |(z - y) + (y - x)| \le |z - y| + |y - x| < \delta + |y - x| \le
\varepsilon$. Note that $\varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ precisely because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, so such a $\delta$ always exists.

## Remarks

- **The radius is a real number, not a rational.** Nothing on this page tests a
  condition against rational radii only. That convention belongs to
  [[def-real-limit]], where the quantifier is over rational $\varepsilon$ and
  the passage between the rational and the real form is the sanctioned remark of
  [[def-sequence]]. Here $\varepsilon$ ranges over the positive reals
  throughout, and every statement above is proved for an arbitrary positive
  real.

- **Why the punctured version is separated out.** A limit point of a set is a
  point every punctured neighbourhood of which meets the set
  ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and deleting the centre is exactly what stops a point
  of the set from qualifying automatically. The unpunctured condition defines
  the weaker notion of an adherent point, and the difference between the two is
  precisely an isolated point.

- **Nesting is the workhorse.** Almost every openness verification on this page
  has the shape "given $y$ in the set, shrink the radius by the distance
  already travelled", which is the nesting property above. It is recorded here
  once so that no later proof has to redo the triangle inequality in passing.

## Definition

Let $U, F \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]].

- $U$ is **open** when for every $x \in U$ there is a real $\varepsilon > 0$
  with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$.
- $F$ is **closed** when its complement $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open.
- A set is **clopen** when it is both open and closed.

The whole of the topology of $\mathbb{R}$ developed on this page rests on this
one definition: closedness is *defined* as openness of the complement, and every
other description of a closed set on this page is a theorem
([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]]).

**$\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen.** The condition defining openness
quantifies over the elements of the set, so it holds vacuously for
$\varnothing$; and for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ one has $N_1(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$,
so $\mathbb{R}$ is open. Since each of the two is the complement of the other,
each is also closed.

**Every neighbourhood is open.** Let $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and put
$\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x|$, which is $> 0$ because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$. The nesting property of [[def-neighbourhood-r]] gives
$N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$. So every point of $N_\varepsilon(x)$
has a neighbourhood inside it.

**The four open forms of [[def-interval]] are open sets.** Let $a, b \in
\mathbb{R}$.

- $(a,b)$: for $x$ with $a < x < b$, both $x - a > 0$ and $b - x > 0$, so
  $\delta := \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ is a positive real (the minimum of a
  two-element set of reals exists, [[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).
  If $|y - x| < \delta$ then $y > x - \delta \ge x - (x - a) = a$ and
  $y < x + \delta \le x + (b - x) = b$, so $y \in (a,b)$; hence
  $N_\delta(x) \subseteq (a,b)$.
- $(a,\infty)$: for $x > a$ take $\delta := x - a > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y > x - \delta = a$.
- $(-\infty,b)$: for $x < b$ take $\delta := b - x > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y < x + \delta = b$.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: already treated above.

**The four closed forms of [[def-interval]] are closed sets.** In each case the
complement is shown open directly.

- $[a,b]$: if $x \notin [a,b]$ then $x < a$ or $x > b$ by trichotomy
  ([[def-ordered-field]]). If $x < a$, take $\delta := a - x > 0$; every
  $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has $y < x + \delta = a$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. If
  $x > b$, take $\delta := x - b > 0$; every $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has
  $y > x - \delta = b$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. So
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus [a,b]$ is open.
- $[a,\infty)$: its complement is $(-\infty,a)$, which is open by the previous
  paragraph.
- $(-\infty,b]$: its complement is $(b,\infty)$, which is open.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: its complement is $\varnothing$, which is
  open.

## Remarks

- **Open and closed are not opposites, and not exhaustive.** A set may be
  neither: the half-open interval $[0,1)$ is neither open nor closed
  ([[fs-every-set-is-open-or-closed]]). A set may be both: $\varnothing$ and
  $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen. The words are inherited from the interval terminology
  of [[def-interval]], and the agreement between the two usages is exactly the
  two lists verified above: an interval called open there is an open set here,
  and an interval called closed there is a closed set here.

- **A clopen set is a disconnection waiting to happen.** If $A$ is clopen and
  both $A$ and $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ are nonempty, then each of the two is
  its own closure, so the two are separated in the sense of
  [[def-connected-r]] and $\mathbb{R} = A \cup (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)$ is a
  disconnection. Since $\mathbb{R}$ is order-convex it is connected
  ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]]), so no such $A$ exists:
  $\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are the only clopen subsets of $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The half-open forms are the ones the two lists omit**, and deliberately so:
  $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ with $a < b$ are neither open nor closed as subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The radius depends on the point.** Openness asks for *some* $\varepsilon$
  at each point, and that $\varepsilon$ may shrink to nothing as the point
  approaches the edge of the set, as the computation for $(a,b)$ shows: there
  $\delta = \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ tends to $0$ as $x$ tends to either endpoint.
  Asking instead for a single $\varepsilon$ that works simultaneously at every
  point of the set is a strictly stronger condition, and it is not what is
  defined here; nothing on this page uses it.

## Definition

Let $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with open sets as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

- An **open cover** of $K$ is a family $\mathcal{U}$ of open subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$ with $K \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{U}$.
- A **subcover** of $\mathcal{U}$ is a subfamily $\mathcal{V} \subseteq
  \mathcal{U}$ that is still an open cover of $K$.
- A subfamily $\mathcal{V} \subseteq \mathcal{U}$ is **finite** when
  $\mathcal{V} = \varnothing$ or there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and members
  $U_0, \dots, U_n$ of $\mathcal{U}$ with $\mathcal{V} = \{U_0, \dots, U_n\}$;
  repetitions in the list are allowed and harmless.
- $K$ is **compact** when every open cover of $K$ has a finite subcover:
  for every open cover $\mathcal{U}$ of $K$, either $K = \varnothing$ and the
  empty subfamily covers it, or there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
  $U_0, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{U}$ with
  $$K \subseteq U_0 \cup \dots \cup U_n .$$
- $K$ is **sequentially compact** when every sequence $(x_k)$ of reals with
  $x_k \in K$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-sequence]]) has a subsequence
  converging ([[def-real-limit]]) to some point of $K$; equivalently, when every
  such sequence has a subsequential limit ([[def-subsequential-limit]]) that
  lies in $K$.

**Compactness is a property of $K$ alone.** The covering families range over open
subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, not over sets open in some other ambient space, so the
notion defined here is compactness of $K$ as a subset of $\mathbb{R}$. Nothing
below relativises it to a smaller ambient field; where an ordered field other
than $\mathbb{R}$ is meant, as in
[[fs-closed-bounded-compact-without-completeness]], the whole vocabulary is set
up again there for that field.

**$\varnothing$ is compact and sequentially compact.** The empty subfamily covers
it, and there is no sequence with all terms in $\varnothing$, so both conditions
hold vacuously.

## Remarks

- **Why "finite" is spelled out by listing.** A finite subfamily is described
  here as one that can be written $\{U_0, \dots, U_n\}$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}$,
  which is exactly the form every proof on this page produces or consumes: the
  bisection argument of [[thm-heine-borel-r]] produces a one-member list, and
  the arguments of [[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]] consume a list by
  taking a maximum over it ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]). Since $\mathbb{N}$
  contains $0$, the shortest nonempty list is $\{U_0\}$.

- **The two notions are not defined to be equivalent, and their equivalence is a
  theorem.** For subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ it is
  [[thm-compact-iff-sequentially-compact-r]]; both of its implications run
  through the characterisation of compactness by closed and bounded, and its
  forward implication additionally uses Bolzano-Weierstrass. Neither implication
  is formal.

- **Compactness is not inherited by subsets, but by closed subsets.** A closed
  subset of a compact set is compact, which is immediate from
  [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]] once that is available, whereas
  $(0,1) \subseteq [0,1]$ shows that an arbitrary subset of a compact set need
  not be compact.

- **The empty cover.** If $K \ne \varnothing$ then no open cover of $K$ is
  empty, so the case distinction in the definition of compactness only ever
  matters for $K = \varnothing$; it is written out so that the definition does
  not quietly assume $K$ nonempty.

## Definition

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ ([[def-field]]) together with a subset
$P \subseteq F$, the set of **positive** elements (the *positive cone*),
satisfying:

- **(O1) Trichotomy.** For each $x \in F$, exactly one of the following holds:
  $x \in P$, or $x = 0$, or $-x \in P$.
- **(O2) Closure.** If $x, y \in P$ then $x + y \in P$ and $x \cdot y \in P$.

We write $x > 0$ for $x \in P$ (read "$x$ is positive"), and define the order by

$$a < b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; b - a \in P, \qquad a \le b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; a < b \text{ or } a = b.$$

Thus $a > b$ means $b < a$, and $a \ge b$ means $b \le a$. An element $x$ with
$-x \in P$ (equivalently $x < 0$) is called **negative**.

## Remarks

- By trichotomy applied to $b - a$, for any $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$,
  $a = b$, $a > b$ holds; this makes $\le$ a total order.
- (O2) says the positives are closed under addition and multiplication: sums and
  products of positives are positive.
- The rationals ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and both constructions of the reals
  ([[thm-reals-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-dedekind-ordered-field]]) are ordered
  fields, so every fact proved here from (O1)-(O2) holds in each of them.

## Definition

**Standing hypothesis for this page.** Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete
ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]),
$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers and **contains $0$**
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[def-nat-order]]), $\iota : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$
is the canonical natural ([[def-canonical-natural]]), and $a, b$ are reals with

$$a \;<\; b .$$

Intervals and their lengths are those of [[def-interval]]; finite sums are those
of [[def-finite-sum]], indexed as $\sum_{i<n}$ over $i \in \mathbb{N}$.

### Partitions

A **partition of $[a,b]$** is a pair $P = (n, t)$ consisting of a natural number
$n \ge 1$ and a sequence $t : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-sequence]]) with

$$t_0 = a, \qquad t_i < t_{i+1} \ \text{ for every } i < n, \qquad t_k = b \ \text{ for every } k \ge n .$$

The tail convention on the third clause is bookkeeping only: it makes $t$ a
genuine sequence, so that the finite-sum laws of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] apply to
it verbatim, and it costs nothing because no index above $n$ is ever read. The
first two clauses say exactly that

$$a \;=\; t_0 \;<\; t_1 \;<\; \dots \;<\; t_n \;=\; b ,$$

the last equality because $t_n = b$ by the third clause. In particular
$i \mapsto t_i$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on
$\{\, i \in \mathbb{N} : i \le n \,\}$ ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]),
and $a \le t_i \le b$ for every $i \le n$.

The **point set** of $P$ is the finite set

$$\operatorname{pts}(P) \;:=\; \{\, t_i \ : \ i \le n \,\} \;\subseteq\; [a,b], \qquad a, b \in \operatorname{pts}(P) .$$

The **subintervals** of $P$ are

$$I_i \;:=\; [\,t_i,\ t_{i+1}\,] \qquad (i < n),$$

and their **lengths** are $\Delta_i := t_{i+1} - t_i$. Each $\Delta_i > 0$, so
each $I_i$ is a nondegenerate closed bounded interval ([[def-interval]]). There
are $n$ of them and they are indexed from $i = 0$, not from $i = 1$: the first
subinterval is $[t_0, t_1] = [a, t_1]$.

**The lengths sum to $b - a$.** By the telescoping law, clause 5 of
[[lem-finite-sum-laws]],

$$\sum_{i<n} \Delta_i \;=\; \sum_{i<n} (t_{i+1} - t_i) \;=\; t_n - t_0 \;=\; b - a .$$

**The mesh.** The set $\{\, \Delta_i : i < n \,\}$ is a nonempty finite set of
reals, nonempty because $n \ge 1$, so it has a maximum
([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]). The **mesh** of $P$ is

$$\|P\| \;:=\; \max\{\, \Delta_i \ : \ i < n \,\} \;>\; 0 ,$$

and $\Delta_i \le \|P\|$ for every $i < n$.

**The uniform partition.** For a natural $N \ge 1$, the **uniform partition of
$[a,b]$ into $N$ parts** is $U_N := (N, t)$ with

$$t_i \;:=\; a + \iota(i)\,\frac{b-a}{\iota(N)} \quad (i \le N), \qquad t_k := b \quad (k \ge N).$$

This is a partition: $t_0 = a$; $t_N = a + (b-a) = b$; and $t_{i+1} - t_i =
(b-a)/\iota(N) > 0$ for $i < N$, because $\iota(N) > 0$ and $\iota(i+1) =
\iota(i) + 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[def-canonical-natural]]). Its
subinterval lengths are all equal to $(b-a)/\iota(N)$, so

$$\|U_N\| \;=\; \frac{b-a}{\iota(N)} .$$

### A partition is determined by its point set

**Claim.** If $P = (n,t)$ and $P' = (n', t')$ are partitions of $[a,b]$ with
$\operatorname{pts}(P) = \operatorname{pts}(P')$, then $n = n'$ and $t_i = t'_i$
for every $i \le n$.

*Proof.* First, $t_i = t'_i$ for every $i \le \min\{n,n'\}$, by induction on $i$
([[thm-induction-principle]]). For $i = 0$ both equal $a$. Suppose $t_j = t'_j$
for all $j \le i$ and $i + 1 \le \min\{n,n'\}$. The set
$S := \{\, x \in \operatorname{pts}(P) : x > t_i \,\}$ has $t_{i+1}$ as its least
element: $t_{i+1} \in S$, and any $x \in S$ is $t_j$ for some $j \le n$ with
$t_j > t_i$, which forces $j > i$ because $t$ is increasing on indices $\le n$,
hence $j \ge i+1$ and $x = t_j \ge t_{i+1}$. The same argument in $P'$ makes
$t'_{i+1}$ the least element of
$\{\, x \in \operatorname{pts}(P') : x > t'_i \,\}$, which is the same set $S$,
since the point sets agree and $t'_i = t_i$. A set has at most one least element
([[def-max-min]]), so $t_{i+1} = t'_{i+1}$.

Second, $n = n'$. If $n < n'$ then $t'_n = t_n = b$ by the previous paragraph,
while $t'_n < t'_{n'} = b$ because $t'$ is increasing on indices $\le n'$ and
$n < n'$; that is impossible. Exchanging the roles of $P$ and $P'$ rules out
$n' < n$. $\square$

So the map $P \mapsto \operatorname{pts}(P)$ is injective, and a partition may be
named by its point set whenever one is exhibited.

### Inserting a point

Let $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ and let $c \in [a,b]$. Define a
partition $P + c$ of $[a,b]$ as follows.

- If $c \in \operatorname{pts}(P)$, put $P + c := P$.
- Otherwise $c \ne a$ and $c \ne b$, so $a < c < b$. The set
  $T := \{\, t_i : i \le n \text{ and } t_i < c \,\}$ is a nonempty finite set of
  reals, nonempty because $t_0 = a < c$, so it has a maximum
  ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]); let $i_0 \le n$ be the unique index with
  $t_{i_0} = \max T$, unique because $t$ is injective on indices $\le n$. Then
  $i_0 < n$, since $t_n = b > c$ puts $t_n \notin T$; and
  $$t_{i_0} \;<\; c \;<\; t_{i_0+1},$$
  the right inequality because $t_{i_0+1} \ne c$ (as $c \notin \operatorname{pts}(P)$)
  and $t_{i_0+1} < c$ would put $t_{i_0+1} \in T$ with $t_{i_0+1} > t_{i_0} = \max T$.
  Put $P + c := (n+1, s)$ with
  $$s_i := t_i \ (i \le i_0), \qquad s_{i_0+1} := c, \qquad s_i := t_{i-1} \ (i_0 + 2 \le i \le n+1), \qquad s_k := b \ (k \ge n+1).$$

In both cases $P + c$ is a partition of $[a,b]$ and

$$\operatorname{pts}(P + c) \;=\; \operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \{c\}, \qquad \|P+c\| \;\le\; \|P\| .$$

The displayed identity is immediate from the two cases. For the mesh: in the
first case nothing changes; in the second the list of subinterval lengths of
$P + c$ is that of $P$ with $\Delta_{i_0}$ replaced by the two numbers
$c - t_{i_0}$ and $t_{i_0+1} - c$, each of which is smaller than
$\Delta_{i_0} = (c - t_{i_0}) + (t_{i_0+1} - c)$ because the other is positive.
So every length of $P + c$ is at most a length of $P$, and the maximum cannot
increase. Finally the index count grows by exactly $1$ in the second case and
not at all in the first.

### Refinement and the common refinement

$P'$ **refines** $P$, and is a **refinement** of $P$, when

$$\operatorname{pts}(P) \;\subseteq\; \operatorname{pts}(P') .$$

Let $P = (n,t)$ and $Q = (m,s)$ be partitions of $[a,b]$. Applying the recursion
theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) to the set $\mathbb{N} \times \mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$,
where $\mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$ is the set of partitions of $[a,b]$, with starting
element $(0, P)$ and the map $(j, R) \mapsto (j+1,\ R + s_j)$ — legitimate
because $s_j \in [a,b]$ for every $j \in \mathbb{N}$ — gives a unique family
$(R_j)_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ of partitions with $R_0 = P$ and $R_{j+1} = R_j + s_j$.
The **common refinement** of $P$ and $Q$ is

$$P \vee Q \;:=\; R_{m+1} .$$

**Its point set is the union.** By induction on $j$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]),
$\operatorname{pts}(R_j) = \operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \{\, s_l : l < j \,\}$;
taking $j = m+1$ gives

$$\operatorname{pts}(P \vee Q) \;=\; \operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \operatorname{pts}(Q).$$

Hence $P \vee Q$ refines both $P$ and $Q$; by the uniqueness claim above it is
the **only** partition with that point set, so $P \vee Q = Q \vee P$, and

$$P' \text{ refines } P \quad \Longrightarrow \quad P \vee P' = P' ,$$

since then $\operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \operatorname{pts}(P') =
\operatorname{pts}(P')$.

**Two size bounds, both used later.** Writing $n_R$ for the first component of a
partition $R$:

$$\|P \vee Q\| \;\le\; \|P\|, \qquad n_{P \vee Q} \;\le\; n_P + n_Q - 1 .$$

The first is the mesh bound above applied $m+1$ times. For the second, each
insertion raises the index count by at most $1$, and the two insertions of
$s_0 = a$ and $s_m = b$ raise it by $0$, since $a$ and $b$ already lie in
$\operatorname{pts}(P)$ and hence in $\operatorname{pts}(R_j)$ for every $j$; so
at most $m - 1$ of the $m+1$ insertions increase it.

### The index map of a refinement

Let $P' = (n',t')$ refine $P = (n,t)$. For each $i \le n$ the point $t_i$ lies in
$\operatorname{pts}(P')$, so there is exactly one $\varphi(i) \le n'$ with
$t'_{\varphi(i)} = t_i$, uniqueness because $t'$ is injective on indices $\le n'$.
The resulting map $\varphi$ satisfies

$$\varphi(0) = 0, \qquad \varphi(n) = n', \qquad \varphi(i) < \varphi(i+1) \ \ (i < n),$$

the first two because $t'_0 = a = t_0$ and $t'_{n'} = b = t_n$ together with
injectivity, and the third because $t_i < t_{i+1}$ and $t'$ is increasing on
indices $\le n'$. In particular $n \le n'$. Moreover, for $i < n$ and
$\varphi(i) \le j < \varphi(i+1)$,

$$I'_j \;=\; [\,t'_j,\ t'_{j+1}\,] \;\subseteq\; [\,t_i,\ t_{i+1}\,] \;=\; I_i ,$$

because $t_i = t'_{\varphi(i)} \le t'_j$ and $t'_{j+1} \le t'_{\varphi(i+1)} = t_{i+1}$.

**The blocks are counted by telescoping.** By clause 5 of
[[lem-finite-sum-laws]],
$\sum_{i<n}\big(\varphi(i+1) - \varphi(i)\big) = \varphi(n) - \varphi(0) = n'$,
so, subtracting $\sum_{i<n} 1 = n$,

$$\sum_{i<n} \big(\varphi(i+1) - \varphi(i) - 1\big) \;=\; n' - n ,$$

a sum of $n$ nonnegative integers, one for each block, which vanishes exactly at
the blocks consisting of a single index. This identity is the whole content of
the quantitative bound in [[lem-refinement-inequalities]], and it is also why
$n \le n'$.

Finally, the lengths inside a block sum to the length of the block:

$$\sum_{j = \varphi(i)}^{\varphi(i+1)-1} \Delta'_j \;=\; t'_{\varphi(i+1)} - t'_{\varphi(i)} \;=\; t_{i+1} - t_i \;=\; \Delta_i \qquad (i < n),$$

again by telescoping, applied to the sequence $l \mapsto t'_{\varphi(i)+l}$ and
read through the index-shift convention of [[def-finite-sum]].

## Remarks

- **Why $a < b$ is a standing hypothesis and not a case.** With $a = b$ the
  displayed chain $a = t_0 < \dots < t_n = b$ is unsatisfiable for $n \ge 1$, and
  admitting $n = 0$ would give a partition with no subintervals, an empty mesh
  set and no maximum. Every statement on this page is about a nondegenerate
  closed bounded interval, and the convention $\int_a^a f := 0$ is not adopted
  here because nothing below needs it.

- **The subintervals overlap at their shared endpoints, and that is harmless.**
  $I_i \cap I_{i+1} = \{t_{i+1}\}$, so the union $\bigcup_{i<n} I_i = [a,b]$ is
  not disjoint. Every quantity attached to a partition below is a sum over $i<n$
  of a number times $\Delta_i$, and a single point contributes length $0$, so no
  statement on this page is sensitive to the double counting of the $n-1$
  interior points.

- **Refinement is a relation between point sets, not between lists.** Defining it
  as "$P'$ is obtained from $P$ by inserting points" would be the same relation,
  by the uniqueness claim above, but it would make every proof carry an
  insertion order. The index map $\varphi$ recovers the list-level picture when
  it is wanted, and it is what [[lem-refinement-inequalities]] actually uses.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$. Then $f$ is
**uniformly continuous on $A$** when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x, x' \in A)\ \bigl[\ |x - x'| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - f(x')| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

with $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ ranging over the positive reals.

**The whole content is in the order of the quantifiers.** Written out,
continuity on $A$ ([[def-continuity-real]]) is

$$\forall \varepsilon\ \forall c \in A\ \exists \delta\ \forall x \in A ,$$

and uniform continuity is

$$\forall \varepsilon\ \exists \delta\ \forall x' \in A\ \forall x \in A .$$

Moving $\exists \delta$ to the left of the point quantifier is the entire
difference: for continuity the radius may shrink from point to point, for
uniform continuity one radius must serve the whole of $A$ at once. This is the
same distinction, for the same reason, that [[def-metric-uniform-continuity]]
draws for maps of metric spaces.

**Uniform continuity implies continuity.** Given $\varepsilon > 0$, take the
$\delta$ supplied by uniform continuity and, at a point $c \in A$, apply the
condition with $x' := c$: every $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ satisfies
$|f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$. So the same $\delta$ witnesses continuity at
every point of $A$ simultaneously. The converse fails, and the failure is not
marginal: [[fs-continuity-implies-uniform-continuity]] refutes it on this page,
and the companion page works two witnesses out in full.

**Uniform continuity is a property of the pair $(f, A)$, not of $f$ alone.** The
same formula may be uniformly continuous on one set and not on another:
$x \mapsto 1/x$ is uniformly continuous on $[1,\infty)$ and not on $(0,1)$, and
$x \mapsto x^{2}$ is uniformly continuous on every bounded interval and not on
$\mathbb{R}$. Restricting the domain therefore never destroys uniform
continuity, since the condition then quantifies over fewer pairs; enlarging it
may.

**The two points are unordered and may coincide.** Nothing above excludes
$x = x'$, at which the implication reads $|f(x) - f(x)| = 0 < \varepsilon$
([[lem-of-abs-value]]) and is automatic, and the condition is symmetric in the
two points because $|x - x'| = |x' - x|$.

## Remarks

- **A single $\delta$, and a picture.** For a uniformly continuous $f$ one may
  slide a rectangle of width $\delta$ and height $2\varepsilon$ along the graph
  and never have the graph leave it through the top or bottom. For a merely
  continuous $f$ the rectangle must be narrowed as one moves, and on
  $x \mapsto 1/x$ over $(0,1)$ it must be narrowed without limit.

- **Neighbourhood form.** The condition says
  $f\bigl(A \cap N_{\delta}(x')\bigr) \subseteq N_{\varepsilon}(f(x'))$ for
  every $x' \in A$, with one $\delta$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). That is
  continuity on $A$ with the radius independent of the centre.

- **On an interval this is the notion the extension theorem needs.** A
  uniformly continuous function on a set $D$ extends to one on the closure of
  $D$ ([[cor-continuous-extension-from-a-dense-subset-r]]); mere continuity does
  not suffice, since $x \mapsto 1/x$ on $(0,1)$ has no continuous extension to
  $[0,1]$ ([[def-interval]]).

- **The two standard witnesses, for orientation.** The converse fails in two
  independent ways, each worked out on the companion page:
  [[cex-one-over-x-is-not-uniformly-continuous-on-the-unit-interval]] on a
  bounded domain that is not closed, and
  [[cex-x-squared-is-not-uniformly-continuous-on-r]] on a closed domain that is
  not bounded. Both are named here for orientation only; nothing in this
  definition rests on them.

- **Lipschitz and Hölder conditions are stronger still, and are not redefined
  here.** They are [[def-lipschitz-holder-contraction]] instantiated at
  $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ with $d(x,y) = |x-y|$; the dictionary that makes that
  instantiation legitimate, and that transports the implications of
  [[thm-metric-regularity-hierarchy]] to real functions, is
  [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]], immediately below.

## Statement

For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and all $a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n \in \mathbb{R}$, the
set $\{a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ has a maximum and a minimum ([[def-max-min]]).

What is proved below is exactly the displayed statement, by induction on $n$.

The usual reading, that *every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has a
maximum and a minimum*, follows once one identifies the nonempty finite subsets
of $\mathbb{R}$ with the sets listable as $\{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$. That
identification is recorded as a stipulation in the Given below, because this page
has no definition of finiteness to prove it against. **It is discharged, not
merely assumed**: [[lem-finite-subsets-listable]] proves that the two
descriptions of a nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ agree. That lemma is
recorded in `justified_by` rather than in `deps`, since it is about the sets this
lemma quantifies over and therefore depends on this one. This is what licenses
the notation
$\max\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ and $\min\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ for finite sets of
**real** numbers from this page onwards.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Real numbers $a_0, a_1, a_2, \dots$; for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write $F_n := \{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$, so that $F_{n+1} = F_n \cup \{a_{n+1}\}$. A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and finite exactly when it equals $F_n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and some choice of $a_0, \dots, a_n$.

[A1] $P(n)$ denotes the statement: for all $a_0, \dots, a_n \in \mathbb{R}$, the set $F_n$ has a maximum and a minimum.

[L1] Maximum and minimum: $m = \max X$ means $m \in X$ and $x \le m$ for all $x \in X$; $m = \min X$ means $m \in X$ and $m \le x$ for all $x \in X$; each is unique when it exists ([[def-max-min]]).

[L2] Induction principle: if $P(0)$ holds and $P(n)$ implies $P(n+1)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $P(n)$ holds for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, where $n + 1$ denotes the successor $\sigma(n)$ ([[thm-induction-principle]], [[def-nat-addition]]).

[L3] The order on $\mathbb{R}$ is reflexive, total and transitive: $a \le a$; for all $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds, so at least one of $a \le b$ and $b \le a$ holds; and $a \le b$ with $b \le c$ gives $a \le c$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case: $F_0 = \{a_0\}$, and $a_0 \in F_0$ with $a_0 \le a_0$ by reflexivity, so $a_0$ is both a maximum and a minimum of $F_0$; hence $P(0)$ holds. [base, A1, L1, L3]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume $P(n)$, that is, for all reals $a_0, \dots, a_n$ the set $F_n$ has a maximum and a minimum. [ih, A1]

2.1 Let $a_0, \dots, a_{n+1} \in \mathbb{R}$ be arbitrary; by the inductive hypothesis the set $F_n$ has a maximum $M$ and a minimum $m$, and $F_{n+1} = F_n \cup \{a_{n+1}\}$. [step 1.2, L1]

3.1 By totality at least one of $a_{n+1} \le M$ and $M \le a_{n+1}$ holds. If $a_{n+1} \le M$, then $M \in F_n \subseteq F_{n+1}$, every element of $F_n$ is $\le M$ because $M = \max F_n$, and $a_{n+1} \le M$ as well, so $M$ is a maximum of $F_{n+1}$. If $M \le a_{n+1}$, then $a_{n+1} \in F_{n+1}$, every $x \in F_n$ satisfies $x \le M \le a_{n+1}$ hence $x \le a_{n+1}$ by transitivity, and $a_{n+1} \le a_{n+1}$, so $a_{n+1}$ is a maximum of $F_{n+1}$. Either way $F_{n+1}$ has a maximum. [step 2.1, L1, L3]

3.2 Dually, at least one of $m \le a_{n+1}$ and $a_{n+1} \le m$ holds. If $m \le a_{n+1}$, then $m \in F_{n+1}$ and every element of $F_{n+1}$ is $\ge m$, so $m$ is a minimum of $F_{n+1}$. If $a_{n+1} \le m$, then $a_{n+1} \in F_{n+1}$ and every $x \in F_n$ satisfies $a_{n+1} \le m \le x$ hence $a_{n+1} \le x$ by transitivity, so $a_{n+1}$ is a minimum of $F_{n+1}$. Either way $F_{n+1}$ has a minimum. [step 2.1, L1, L3]

4.1 Since $a_0, \dots, a_{n+1}$ were arbitrary, $F_{n+1}$ has a maximum and a minimum for every such list, that is, $P(n)$ implies $P(n+1)$. [step 3.1, step 3.2, A1]

5.1 The base case and the inductive step give $P(n)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ by the induction principle; since a nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is exactly a set of the form $F_n$, every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has both a maximum and a minimum. [step 1.1, step 4.1, given, L2, discharge-induction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the stipulation is discharged.** Finiteness itself is defined later, in [[def-countable]], as equinumerosity with a von Neumann natural; with that definition in hand [[lem-finite-subsets-listable]] proves that a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and finite exactly when it is listable as $\{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$, which is the Given below. So nothing on this page rests on an assumption that is never paid for; it is paid for later, and the payment is recorded in `justified_by`.
- **Only the total order is used, never completeness.** The base case needs reflexivity, the inductive step needs totality and transitivity, and the induction itself runs over $\mathbb{N}$. The same induction works in any totally ordered field; what is recorded here is its specialisation to $\mathbb{R}$.
- Nonemptiness is essential: $\emptyset$ is finite and has no maximum ([[def-max-min]]). Finiteness is essential too: $\{x \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < x < 1\}$ is bounded and has no maximum ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Combined with claim 1 of [[lem-max-is-sup]], this says every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has a supremum, and that the supremum is attained, because it equals the maximum. The infimum half is *not* part of [[lem-max-is-sup]], which speaks only of maxima and suprema; it follows from the minimum proved here together with the reflection identity $\inf X = -\sup(-X)$ ([[lem-reflection]], [[thm-infimum-property]]).

## Statement

Let $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be sequences of reals, let
$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, and let $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, with finite sums and
finite products as in [[def-finite-sum]]. Then:

1. **Additivity.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k$.
2. **Scaling.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k$; in particular $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda = n\lambda$, where $n$ denotes the canonical natural $\iota(n) \in \mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).
3. **Splitting.** If $m \le n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k$, and $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n} a_k = \Big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k\Big)$.
4. **Monotonicity.** If $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$. In particular, if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, every single term satisfies $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$ for $j < n$, and $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ forces $a_k = 0$ for every $k < n$.
5. **Telescoping.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}\big(c_{k+1} - c_k\big) = c_n - c_0$.
6. **Products.** $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k) = \Big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\Big)$; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, and if $a_k > 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k > 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\lambda$, and naturals $m, n$. Write $\Sigma_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\Pi_n = \prod_{k<n} a_k$.

[L1] Recursion clauses ([[def-finite-sum]]): $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ and $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n$; $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1$ and $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) \cdot a_n$; and $\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k = \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j}$ for $m \le n$, likewise for products.

[L2] Field axioms: addition and multiplication are associative and commutative, $0$ and $1$ are the identities, $x - x = 0$, and multiplication distributes over addition ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]); and $0 \cdot x = 0$, which is not an axiom but a lemma ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

[L3] Induction principle: a property holding at $0$ and inherited by successors holds at every natural ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L4] Adding inequalities: $x \le y$ and $u \le v$ imply $x + u \le y + v$. [[lem-of-add-order]] states the STRICT forms and only those ($x < y \Rightarrow x + c < y + c$, and $x < y$ with $u < v$ giving $x + u < y + v$); the nonstrict form used throughout below is those two together with the cases $x = y$ and $u = v$, which are settled by trichotomy, the order being total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] The canonical embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a field homomorphism, so $\iota(0) = 0$ and $\iota(n+1) = \iota(n) + 1$, and $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L6] Sign rules: a product of two positives is positive ([[lem-of-sign-rules]], claim 1), and a product of two nonnegatives is nonnegative, since a factor equal to $0$ makes the product $0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]) and otherwise both factors are positive; and $1 > 0$, which is proved in [[cor-of-one-positive]] and stated by none of the items named above.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 0$: every claim holds at $n = 0$, since both sides of claim 1 are $0 = 0 + 0$, both sides of claim 2 are $0 = \lambda \cdot 0$ and $0 = \iota(0)\lambda$, claim 4 reads $0 \le 0$ with no term to bound and the hypothesis $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ giving nothing to prove, claim 5 reads $0 = c_0 - c_0$, and claim 6 reads $1 = 1 \cdot 1$ with $1 > 0$. [base, L1, L2, L5, L6]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for this $n$ and for all sequences $a, b, c$ and all $\lambda$. [ih]

1.3 Splitting, claim 3, by a separate induction on the number of trailing terms $d = n - m$ with $m$ fixed: for $d = 0$ the claim reads $\sum_{k<m} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + 0$ and $\prod_{k<m} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\big) \cdot 1$, which hold; and if $\sum_{k<m+d} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d} a_{m+j}$, then $\sum_{k<m+d+1} a_k = \sum_{k<m+d} a_k + a_{m+d} = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \big(\sum_{j<d} a_{m+j} + a_{m+d}\big) = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d+1} a_{m+j}$ by associativity, and identically for products with $1$ in place of $0$ and multiplication in place of addition, so induction on $d$ gives claim 3 for every $m \le n$. [L1, L2, L3]

2.1 Additivity at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k\big) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) + \big(\sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n\big) = \sum_{k<n+1} a_k + \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$, using the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of addition. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Scaling at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda a_k = \sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda\big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) = \lambda \sum_{k<n+1} a_k$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and distributivity; taking $a_k = 1$ for all $k$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda = \sum_{k<n} \lambda + \lambda = \iota(n)\lambda + \lambda = (\iota(n) + 1)\lambda = \iota(n+1)\lambda$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L5]

2.3 Monotonicity at $n+1$: assume $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n+1$; then $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$, so the hypothesis gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$, and adding the inequality $a_n \le b_n$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n \le \sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n = \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$. [step 1.2, L1, L4]

2.4 Telescoping at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(c_{k+1} - c_k) = \sum_{k<n}(c_{k+1} - c_k) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = (c_n - c_0) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = c_{n+1} - c_0$, by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and the field identities. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.5 Products at $n+1$: $\prod_{k<n+1}(a_k b_k) = \big(\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k)\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n+1} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n+1} b_k\big)$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of multiplication; and if every $a_k \ge 0$ for $k < n+1$ then $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) a_n$ is a product of two nonnegatives, hence nonnegative, with the same argument giving positivity from positivity since $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1 > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L6]

3.1 Consequences of monotonicity, completing claim 4: monotonicity itself holds at every $n$, by the induction principle applied to the base case of step 1.1 and the successor step 2.3, so it is available for an arbitrary $n$ in what follows; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then comparing with the zero sequence gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge \sum_{k<n} 0 = 0$; for $j < n$ splitting at $j$ and then at $j+1$ writes $\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<j} a_k + a_j + \sum_{k=j+1}^{n-1} a_k$ with the first and third summands $\ge 0$, so $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$; and if moreover $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ then $0 \le a_j \le 0$ for every $j < n$, so $a_j = 0$. [step 1.1, step 2.3, step 1.3, L3, L4, L2]

4.1 By the induction principle claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and claim 3 was proved in step 1.3 with its consequences in step 3.1, so all six laws hold. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, step 2.5, step 1.3, step 3.1, L3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$, with
$|x|$ the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]). Then

$$|x| \ge 0; \quad |x| = 0 \iff x = 0; \quad -|x| \le x \le |x|; \quad |-x| = |x|; \quad |xy| = |x|\,|y|;$$

and, for every $c > 0$, one has $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and elements $x, y \in F$.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| = u$ if $u \ge 0$, and $|u| = -u$ if $u < 0$ ([[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Ordered-field order: trichotomy holds (for each $u$ exactly one of $u > 0$, $u = 0$, $u < 0$), $a < b$ means $b - a$ is positive, and sums and products of positives are positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Signs in products: $(-a)b = -(ab)$ and $(-a)(-b) = ab$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] Sign rules: a product of two elements of the same sign is positive, and a product of two elements of opposite sign is negative ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Case $x > 0$: by [L1] $|x| = x > 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; since $-x < 0$ we get $|-x| = -(-x) = x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -x < 0 < x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case pos, L1, L2, algebra]

1.2 Case $x = 0$: then $|x| = |0| = 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ holds with $|x| = 0$ and $x = 0$, while $|-x| = |0| = |x|$ and $-|x| = 0 \le 0 \le 0 = |x|$. [assume-case zero, L1]

1.3 Case $x < 0$: by [L1] $|x| = -x$, and [L2] gives $-x > 0$, so $|x| > 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; here $|-x| = -x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -(-x) = x \le x$ while $x < 0 < -x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case neg, L1, L2, algebra]

1.4 Case $x = 0$ or $y = 0$: then $xy = 0$, so $|xy| = 0$, and one of $|x|, |y|$ is $0$, whence $|x|\,|y| = 0 = |xy|$. [assume-case zerofactor, L1]

1.5 Case $x, y$ have the same sign (both positive or both negative): by [L4] $xy > 0$, so $|xy| = xy$, while $|x|\,|y| = xy$ by [L3] (for $x, y < 0$ this is $(-x)(-y) = xy$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case same, L1, L3, L4]

1.6 Case $x, y$ have opposite signs (one positive, one negative): by [L4] $xy < 0$, so $|xy| = -(xy)$, while $|x|\,|y| = -(xy)$ by [L3] (namely $x(-y)$ or $(-x)y$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case opposite, L1, L3, L4]

2.1 By trichotomy [L2] each $x$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.1-1.3, and in each we verified $|x| \ge 0$, that $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$, that $|-x| = |x|$, and that $-|x| \le x \le |x|$; hence all four hold for every $x$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, cases-exhaustive]

2.2 By trichotomy [L2] each pair $x, y$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.4-1.6, and in each $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$ for all $x, y$. [step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6, cases-exhaustive]

3.1 Let $c > 0$: if $|x| < c$ then $-c < -|x| \le x \le |x| < c$ by [step 2.1] and [L2], so $-c < x < c$; conversely if $-c < x < c$ then both $x < c$ and $-x < c$, and since $|x|$ equals $x$ or $-x$ by [L1], we get $|x| < c$, so $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$. [step 2.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b, c, d \in F$.

1. **Translation invariance.** If $a < b$ then $a + c < b + c$.
2. **Adding inequalities.** If $a < b$ and $c < d$ then $a + c < b + d$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b, c, d \in F$.

[L1] For $x, y \in F$, the relation $x < y$ means $y - x \in P$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] $P$ is closed under addition: if $u, v \in P$ then $u + v \in P$ (axiom O2 of [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a < b$; by the definition of the order this means $b - a \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.2 For every $c \in F$ the field identities give $(b + c) - (a + c) = b - a$. [algebra]

1.3 Assume moreover $c < d$; by the definition of the order this means $d - c \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.4 The field identities give $(b + d) - (a + c) = (b - a) + (d - c)$. [algebra]

2.1 Hence $(b + c) - (a + c) = b - a \in P$, which is exactly $a + c < b + c$, proving claim 1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1]

2.2 Since $b - a \in P$ and $d - c \in P$, closure under addition gives $(b - a) + (d - c) \in P$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, L2]

3.1 Therefore $(b + d) - (a + c) = (b - a) + (d - c) \in P$, which is exactly $a + c < b + d$, proving claim 2. [step 1.4, step 2.2, L1] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field, with field structure as in [[def-field]], and for
$n \ge 1$ let $n \cdot 1_F$ denote the canonical natural number
$\underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$, defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$
and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$. Then for every $n \ge 1$:

- $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$;
- the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$;
- $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ and $(mn) \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F)$ for all $m, n \ge 1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ whose canonical naturals are defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, with $0 \cdot 1_F = 0$.

[L1] $0 < 1_F$ in every ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] The order is compatible with addition and positives are closed under addition: $a < b$ implies $a + c < b + c$, and $a > 0$, $b > 0$ imply $a + b > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 1$: by definition $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, and $1_F > 0$. [L1, base]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: assume $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for some fixed $n \ge 1$. [ih]

1.3 By the recursion, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F - n \cdot 1_F = 1_F > 0$, so $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$. [given, L1]

1.4 Additive identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ by the recursion, and if $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ then $(m+n+1) \cdot 1_F = (m+n) \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + (n+1) \cdot 1_F$. [given, algebra]

2.1 Inductive step: $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ is a sum of two positives, by the hypothesis and $1_F > 0$, hence $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Iterating 1.3, for $m < n$ one has $m \cdot 1_F < n \cdot 1_F$, so $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing and therefore injective on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$. [step 1.3, L2]

2.3 Multiplicative identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m \cdot 1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(1 \cdot 1_F)$, and the step $(m(n+1)) \cdot 1_F = (mn + m) \cdot 1_F = (mn) \cdot 1_F + m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F) + (m \cdot 1_F)(1_F) = (m \cdot 1_F)((n+1) \cdot 1_F)$ uses 1.4 and distributivity. [step 1.4, algebra]

3.1 By induction on 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for every $n \ge 1$; with the strict increase 2.2 and the identities 1.4, 2.3, every claim holds. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 1.4, step 2.3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b, c \in F$.

1. If $a > 0$ and $b > 0$ then $ab > 0$.
2. If $a > 0$ and $b < 0$ then $ab < 0$.
3. If $a < 0$ and $b < 0$ then $ab > 0$.
4. If $c > 0$ then $a < b \iff ac < bc$.
5. If $c < 0$ then $a < b \iff bc < ac$ (multiplication by a negative reverses order).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b, c \in F$.

[L1] For $x, y \in F$: $x < y \iff y - x \in P$; $x > 0 \iff x \in P$; $x < 0 \iff -x \in P$; and (trichotomy) for each $x$ exactly one of $x \in P$, $x = 0$, $-x \in P$ holds, so $0 \notin P$ and $x \in P \Rightarrow x \neq 0$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] $P$ is closed under multiplication: if $u, v \in P$ then $uv \in P$ (axiom O2 of [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] In any field, $(-u)v = -(uv)$ and $(-u)(-v) = uv$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] In any field, $0 \cdot u = 0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a > 0$ and $b > 0$, i.e. $a \in P$ and $b \in P$; closure gives $ab \in P$, so $ab > 0$, proving claim 1. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.2 Assume $a > 0$ and $b < 0$, i.e. $a \in P$ and $-b \in P$; closure gives $a(-b) \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.3 Assume $a < 0$ and $b < 0$, i.e. $-a \in P$ and $-b \in P$; closure gives $(-a)(-b) \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.4 Assume $c > 0$ and $a < b$, i.e. $c \in P$ and $b - a \in P$; closure gives $(b - a)c \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.5 Assume $c < 0$ and $a < b$, i.e. $-c \in P$ and $b - a \in P$; closure gives $(b - a)(-c) \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

2.1 Since $a(-b) = -(ab)$ by L3, step 1.2 gives $-(ab) \in P$, so $ab < 0$, proving claim 2. [step 1.2, L3, L1]

2.2 Since $(-a)(-b) = ab$ by L3, step 1.3 gives $ab \in P$, so $ab > 0$, proving claim 3. [step 1.3, L3, L1]

2.3 By distributivity $(b - a)c = bc - ac$, so step 1.4 gives $bc - ac \in P$, i.e. $ac < bc$: this is the forward direction of claim 4. [step 1.4, algebra, L1]

2.4 By L3 and distributivity $(b - a)(-c) = -((b - a)c) = -(bc - ac) = ac - bc$, so step 1.5 gives $ac - bc \in P$, i.e. $bc < ac$: this is the forward direction of claim 5. [step 1.5, L3, algebra, L1]

3.1 Conversely, assume $c > 0$ and $ac < bc$; by trichotomy exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds. If $a = b$ then $ac = bc$, contradicting $ac < bc$; if $b < a$ then the argument of step 2.3 applied to the pair $b < a$ gives $bc < ac$, so $bc - ac \in P$ (from $ac < bc$) while $ac - bc \in P$ (from $bc < ac$), putting the element $bc - ac$ and its negative $ac - bc$ both in $P$, which trichotomy forbids; hence $a < b$: this completes claim 4. [assume-hyp, step 2.3, L4, L1, algebra]

4.1 Conversely, assume $c < 0$ and $bc < ac$; by trichotomy exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds. If $a = b$ then $ac = bc$, contradicting $bc < ac$; if $b < a$ then the argument of step 2.4 applied to the pair $b < a$ gives $ac < bc$, so $ac - bc \in P$ (from $bc < ac$) while $bc - ac \in P$ (from $ac < bc$), putting the element $ac - bc$ and its negative $bc - ac$ both in $P$, which trichotomy forbids; hence $a < b$: this completes claim 5.

This page develops the Riemann integral over ZF except at the points recorded
below. The only choice principle that appears anywhere on it is the Axiom of
Countable Choice ([[def-countable-choice]]); the full Axiom of Choice is never
used, and no claim is made anywhere that a use recorded here is *necessary*.

## The four entries that are easy to get wrong

**Selecting a tag in every subinterval is not countable choice.**
[[thm-darboux-equals-riemann]] picks, for a *single fixed* partition, one point
in each of its $n$ subintervals subject to a supremum condition. That family is
listed by the index $i < n$, and a family of nonempty sets listed by a natural
number has a choice function outright, by
[[lem-finite-choice]], which is a theorem of ZF proved by induction. (That
lemma is careful to state only the listed form, since no definition of
finiteness is available where it is proved; the listed form is what is used
here.) The
temptation to read this as a choice principle comes from the phrase "for each
$i$ pick a point"; the number of picks is what matters, and it is finite.

**"For each $n$ pick a partition" would be countable choice, and the page never
does it.** Both directions of [[thm-riemann-criterion]] and the whole of
[[thm-darboux-equals-riemann]] instantiate an existential a fixed, finite number
of times, once per $\varepsilon$ under consideration; no proof on this page ever
forms a sequence of partitions indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ and reasons about it. The
one place where a sequence of sets does appear is step 7.1 of
[[thm-lebesgue-criterion]], and that is exactly where the ledger records a cost.

**Only the forward half of [[thm-lebesgue-criterion]] costs anything.** The
implication "integrable $\Rightarrow$ the discontinuity set is null" exhibits
that set as $\bigcup_k E_{1/(k+1)}$ and applies
[[thm-countable-union-of-null-is-null]], which assumes $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ and
names its own single use. The converse, "null $\Rightarrow$ integrable", is a
theorem of ZF: [[lem-oscillation-superlevel-sets-are-closed]] and
[[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]] are choice-free,
[[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]] and [[lem-content-zero-implies-null]] are
choice-free, and the partition is built by Cousin's supremum construction, which
uses the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ and nothing else. This asymmetry is why
[[cor-countably-many-discontinuities-integrable]] appears in the table with no
cost at all: it uses the converse half only, together with
[[lem-countable-sets-are-null]], whose own statement records that no choice
principle is used there.

**Heine-Cantor is the page's other source, and it is a single use.**
[[thm-heine-cantor-r]] states that its proof invokes $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ exactly
once, to select one bad pair of points from each of countably many nonempty sets,
and that the implication it borrows from
[[thm-compact-iff-sequentially-compact-r]] — compact implies sequentially
compact — spends nothing. So [[thm-continuous-implies-integrable]] and
[[thm-finitely-many-discontinuities-integrable]] each inherit that one use and
add none of their own. The neighbouring ledger for the same expenditure on the
continuity page is [[rem-heine-criterion-choice-cost]].

## What is deliberately not claimed

Nothing here says that $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ is **necessary** for any of the three
theorems that use it. The independence questions for the Heine-Cantor theorem
and for the countable additivity of nullity over $\mathbb{R}$ are not settled in
this library, and no item on this page asserts anything about them. What the
table records is what the proofs on disk actually spend, and it is meant to be
checked against them rather than believed.

The one further caution is that a *later* proof of a result stated here could
spend less. The direct argument for [[thm-monotone-implies-integrable]] is kept
alongside the shorter route through
[[cor-countably-many-discontinuities-integrable]] precisely for that reason: the
direct one is elementary and quantitative, and both are choice-free, so nothing
is lost by keeping the pair.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with closure $\overline{A}$ as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]] and derived set $A'$ as in
[[def-limit-point-r]]. Write

$$E \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing \text{ for every real } \varepsilon > 0 \,\}$$

for the set of adherent points of $A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). Then:

1. $\overline{A} = E$.
2. $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$.
3. $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed superset of $A$: it is closed, it
   contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed $F$ with $A \subseteq F$.
4. $A$ is closed if and only if $A = \overline{A}$, if and only if
   $A' \subseteq A$.

Claim 3 is the content of the definition of $\overline{A}$ and is restated here
so that the four descriptions stand together; claims 1, 2 and 4 are the ones
that carry work.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, and the set $E$ of adherent points of $A$ as displayed in the Statement.

[L1] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; $F$ is closed when $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L2] $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$; $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) = N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$; and if $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ then $\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ and $N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] $\overline{A}$ is the intersection of the nonempty family of closed supersets of $A$; it is closed, it contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed superset of $A$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]).

[L4] $x$ is an adherent point of $A$ when every $N_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $A$, a limit point when every $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $A$, and $A'$ is the set of limit points ([[def-limit-point-r]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $A \subseteq E$: for $x \in A$ and any $\varepsilon > 0$ one has $x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$, so that intersection is nonempty. [L2, L4]

1.2 Let $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus E$; by the definition of $E$ there is a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$. [L4, choose]

1.3 Let $F$ be closed with $A \subseteq F$, and let $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus F$; since $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open there is a real $\eta > 0$ with $N_\eta(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus F$. [L1, choose]

2.1 For every $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ the radius $\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x|$ is positive and $N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, so $N_\delta(y) \cap A = \varnothing$ and $y \notin E$; hence $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$, and since $x$ was an arbitrary point of $\mathbb{R} \setminus E$ that set is open, that is, $E$ is closed. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L4]

2.2 From $N_\eta(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus F \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus A$ we get $N_\eta(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, so $x \notin E$; hence $\mathbb{R} \setminus F \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$, that is, $E \subseteq F$, for every closed $F \supseteq A$. [step 1.3, L4]

3.1 By steps 1.1 and 2.1 the set $E$ is a closed superset of $A$, so $\overline{A} \subseteq E$ by the leastness in [L3]; and $\overline{A}$ is itself a closed superset of $A$ by [L3], so step 2.2 applied to $F = \overline{A}$ gives $E \subseteq \overline{A}$. Hence $\overline{A} = E$, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, L3]

4.1 $E = A \cup A'$: if $x \in E$ and $x \notin A$ then for every $\varepsilon > 0$ some $a \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ exists, and $a \ne x$ because $x \notin A$, so $a \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ and $x \in A'$; conversely $A \subseteq E$ by step 1.1, and $A' \subseteq E$ because $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$. Combining with step 3.1 gives $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$, which is claim 2. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L2, L4]

5.1 Claim 4: if $A$ is closed then $A$ is a closed superset of itself, so $\overline{A} \subseteq A$ by [L3], while $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ by [L3], whence $A = \overline{A}$; conversely if $A = \overline{A}$ then $A$ is closed because $\overline{A}$ is. Finally $A = \overline{A}$ says $A = A \cup A'$ by step 4.1, and $A = A \cup A'$ holds exactly when $A' \subseteq A$. [step 4.1, L3]

6.1 Claim 3 is [L3] restated, and claims 1, 2 and 4 are steps 3.1, 4.1 and 5.1, so all four hold. [step 3.1, step 4.1, step 5.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Which claim does the work in practice.** Claim 1 is the one used almost
  everywhere below: to show a point lies in $\overline{A}$ one exhibits, for each
  $\varepsilon > 0$, a point of $A$ within $\varepsilon$ of it. Claim 2 is what
  separates the two ways a point can be adherent, by membership or by
  accumulation, and it is what makes the notion of an isolated point visible.

- **No special property of $\mathbb{R}$ is used.** The argument uses the
  definitions of open, closed, neighbourhood and closure, and the order enters
  only through the nesting property of neighbourhoods; neither the
  least-upper-bound property nor the Archimedean property appears at any step.
  The results of this page that do use them are flagged in
  [[rem-r-native-topology-scope]].

- **The sequential form is a separate theorem and costs more.** Replacing
  "every neighbourhood meets $A$" by "some sequence in $A$ converges to $x$" is
  [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]], and the passage from the
  first to the second spends the axiom of countable choice, since it selects one
  point of $A$ from each of infinitely many neighbourhoods. The characterisation
  proved above is choice free.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $[a,b]$
([[def-continuity-real]]). Then $f$ is bounded ([[def-bounded-set]]) and Riemann
integrable on $[a,b]$ ([[def-darboux-integral]]).

**The proof gives more than integrability: it gives a partition that works.** For
every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the uniform partition into $N$ parts already
satisfies $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$, as soon as $N$ is large enough that
$(b-a)/\iota(N)$ is below the $\delta$ that uniform continuity supplies for
$\varepsilon/\bigl(2(b-a)\bigr)$. Uniform continuity is exactly what makes one
$\delta$ serve all $N$ subintervals at once, and it is the only place where the
compactness of $[a,b]$ is used.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and a function $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ continuous on $[a,b]$.

[L1] $[a,b]$ is closed and bounded, hence compact ([[def-interval]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-bounded-set]], [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L2] A continuous real function on a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is bounded there ([[cor-boundedness-theorem-r]]).

[L3] Heine-Cantor: a continuous real function on a compact subset $K$ of $\mathbb{R}$ is uniformly continuous on $K$, that is, for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ with $|f(x) - f(y)| < \eta$ for all $x, y \in K$ with $|x - y| < \delta$ ([[thm-heine-cantor-r]], [[def-uniform-continuity-real]]).

[L4] For a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[a,b]$: $\Delta_i = t_{i+1} - t_i > 0$, $\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = b-a$, and the uniform partition $U_N$ into $N \ge 1$ parts has every $\Delta_i$ equal to $(b-a)/\iota(N)$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L5] $U(f,P) - L(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}(M_i - m_i)\Delta_i$ and $M_i - m_i = \sup\{|f(x)-f(y)| : x, y \in I_i\}$ for bounded $f$ ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L6] Riemann's criterion: a bounded $f$ is integrable if and only if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a partition $P$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$ ([[thm-riemann-criterion]]).

[L7] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N) < \eta$, and $\iota(N) > 0$ for $N \ge 1$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L8] Finite sums: scaling and monotonicity in the terms ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L9] Ordered-field arithmetic and the absolute value: adding a constant and multiplying by a positive quantity preserve an inequality; the order is total and transitive; $x, y \in [c,d]$ gives $|x - y| \le d - c$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-interval]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $[a,b]$ is compact by [L1], so $f$ is bounded on $[a,b]$ by [L2] and its Darboux sums and integrals are defined. [given, L1, L2]

1.2 Let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given and put $\eta := \varepsilon \cdot \bigl(2(b-a)\bigr)^{-1}$, a positive real by [L9] since $b - a > 0$. [given, L9]

2.1 By [L3] applied to the compact set $[a,b]$ with this $\eta$, fix a real $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(x) - f(y)| < \eta$ for all $x, y \in [a,b]$ with $|x - y| < \delta$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1, L3, choose]

3.1 By [L7] fix a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N) < \delta \cdot (b-a)^{-1}$, and put $P := U_N = (N,t)$, the uniform partition of $[a,b]$ into $N$ parts. Then every $\Delta_i$ equals $(b-a)/\iota(N) < \delta$ by [L4] and [L9]. [step 2.1, L4, L7, L9, choose]

4.1 For each $i < N$ and all $x, y \in I_i = [t_i, t_{i+1}]$ one has $|x-y| \le \Delta_i < \delta$ by [L9], hence $|f(x) - f(y)| < \eta$ by step 2.1. So $\eta$ is an upper bound of the set $\{|f(x)-f(y)| : x,y \in I_i\}$, and therefore $M_i - m_i \le \eta$ by [L5]. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L5, L9]

5.1 Consequently $U(f,P) - L(f,P) = \sum_{i<N}(M_i - m_i)\Delta_i \le \sum_{i<N}\eta\,\Delta_i = \eta\,(b-a) = \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} < \varepsilon$, using [L5], step 4.1, $\Delta_i > 0$, [L8], [L4] and [L9]. [step 4.1, L4, L5, L8, L9]

6.1 Since the real $\varepsilon > 0$ of step 1.2 was arbitrary and step 5.1 produced a partition with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$, criterion [L6] applies and $f$ is Riemann integrable on $[a,b]$; it is bounded by step 1.1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 5.1, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- **Continuity is sufficient and very far from necessary.** A monotone function may have infinitely many discontinuities and is still integrable ([[thm-monotone-implies-integrable]]); Thomae's function is discontinuous at every rational and integrable ([[cor-countably-many-discontinuities-integrable]]); and the indicator of the Cantor set is discontinuous at uncountably many points and integrable. The exact frontier is [[thm-lebesgue-criterion]].

- **Where compactness enters, and what it buys.** Only through [L1], and then twice: [[cor-boundedness-theorem-r]] to know that the Darboux sums exist at all, and [[thm-heine-cantor-r]] to get one $\delta$ for the whole interval. On a non-compact interval both can fail: $x \mapsto 1/x$ is continuous on $(0,1)$ and unbounded there, so it has no Darboux sums at all.

- **The choice cost is inherited, not incurred.** Nothing in the proof above selects anything from an infinite family; the single use of countable choice behind this theorem sits inside [[thm-heine-cantor-r]], which names it in its own statement. See [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].

## Statement

Let $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $K$ is compact ([[def-open-cover-r]]) if and
only if $K$ is closed ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) and bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]).

This is the Heine-Borel theorem in the form used everywhere below. The forward
implication is [[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]] and spends no
completeness, only the Archimedean property and the existence of maxima of
finite sets; the backward implication rests on
[[thm-heine-borel-r]] and therefore on the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$, and the
remarks below record where it fails without completeness.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] Open cover, finite subfamily and compactness; the empty subfamily covers $\varnothing$ ([[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L2] A compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is closed and bounded ([[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]]).

[L3] Every closed bounded interval $[\ell,u]$ with $\ell \le u$ is compact ([[thm-heine-borel-r]]).

[L4] $K$ is closed exactly when $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L5] $K$ is bounded exactly when there are $\ell, u \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\ell \le y \le u$ for every $y \in K$ ([[def-bounded-set]]).

[L6] $[\ell,u] = \{\, z \in \mathbb{R} : \ell \le z \le u \,\}$ ([[def-interval]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 If $K$ is compact then $K$ is closed and bounded, which is [L2]; this is the forward implication. [L2]

1.2 For the backward implication assume $K$ is closed and bounded. If $K = \varnothing$ then every open cover of $K$ admits the empty subfamily as a finite subcover, so $K$ is compact. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.3 Assume moreover $K \ne \varnothing$; fix $s \in K$ and, by [L5], reals $\ell, u$ with $\ell \le y \le u$ for every $y \in K$. Then $\ell \le s \le u$, so $\ell \le u$, and $K \subseteq [\ell,u]$ by [L6]. [assume-hyp, L5, L6, choose]

2.1 Let $\mathcal{U}$ be an open cover of $K$ and put $\mathcal{W} := \mathcal{U} \cup \{\mathbb{R} \setminus K\}$. Every member of $\mathcal{W}$ is open, since $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$ is open by [L4], and $\mathcal{W}$ covers $[\ell,u]$: a point of $[\ell,u]$ either lies in $K$, hence in some member of $\mathcal{U}$, or lies outside $K$, hence in $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$. [step 1.3, L1, L4]

3.1 By [L3] the interval $[\ell,u]$ is compact, so some finite subfamily $\{W_0, \dots, W_p\}$ of $\mathcal{W}$ covers $[\ell,u]$, where the case of an empty subfamily is possible only when $[\ell,u] = \varnothing$, which is excluded by $\ell \le u$. Put $\mathcal{V} := \{\, W_i : W_i \in \mathcal{U} \,\}$, a finite subfamily of $\mathcal{U}$. Then $K \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{V}$: a point $y \in K \subseteq [\ell,u]$ lies in some $W_i$, and $W_i$ cannot be a member of $\mathcal{W}$ outside $\mathcal{U}$, because the only such member is $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$ and $y \in K$; so $W_i \in \mathcal{U}$ and $W_i \in \mathcal{V}$. [step 2.1, L1, L3, L6]

4.1 Every open cover of a nonempty closed bounded $K$ therefore has a finite subcover, so such a $K$ is compact; together with the empty case of step 1.2 this proves the backward implication, and step 1.1 is the forward one. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 3.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **A closed subset of a compact set is compact.** If $C \subseteq K$ with $K$
  compact and $C$ closed, then $C$ is bounded, being a subset of a bounded set,
  and closed by hypothesis, so it is compact by the theorem. The corresponding
  statement for arbitrary subsets is false: $(0,1) \subseteq [0,1]$ is bounded
  and not compact ([[cex-unbounded-closed-set-not-compact]]).

- **Both hypotheses are needed and neither implies the other.**
  [[cex-unbounded-closed-set-not-compact]] exhibits a closed set that is not
  bounded and a bounded set that is not closed, and neither is compact.

- **What the theorem is not.** It characterises compactness *for subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$*. The two halves are of very different strengths: the forward
  half is elementary and general, while the backward half rests on the
  completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ and fails over $\mathbb{Q}$
  ([[fs-closed-bounded-compact-without-completeness]], witnessed by
  [[cex-closed-bounded-in-q-not-compact]]). Nothing here licenses "closed and
  bounded implies compact" in any other setting.

## Statement

Let $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be compact ([[def-open-cover-r]]) and let
$f : K \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $K$ ([[def-continuity-real]]). Then $f$
is uniformly continuous on $K$ ([[def-uniform-continuity-real]]).

**This theorem is stated twice in this library, on purpose.** Its metric-space
twin is [[thm-heine-cantor-metric]], proved there from the cover machinery of
metric spaces; the proof below is $\mathbb{R}$-native and runs through
[[thm-compact-iff-sequentially-compact-r]], which is order-based. That the two
statements are the same statement in two vocabularies is
[[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]], clauses 1, 2 and 5, immediately above.

**The choice cost, named.** The proof invokes the axiom of countable choice
([[def-countable-choice]]) exactly once, at step 3.1, to select one bad pair of
points from each of countably many nonempty sets. The backward implication of
[[thm-compact-iff-sequentially-compact-r]] also spends countable choice, and
that item names its own uses; the forward implication used here, from compact to
sequentially compact, does not. No claim is made that the axiom is necessary
for either.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A compact set $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a function $f : K \to \mathbb{R}$ continuous on $K$.

[L1] Uniform continuity on $K$: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that all $x, x' \in K$ with $|x - x'| < \delta$ satisfy $|f(x) - f(x')| < \varepsilon$. Its negation: there is a real $\varepsilon_0 > 0$ such that for every real $\delta > 0$ some pair $x, x' \in K$ has $|x - x'| < \delta$ and $|f(x) - f(x')| \ge \varepsilon_0$ ([[def-uniform-continuity-real]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] A compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is sequentially compact: every sequence with all terms in $K$ has a subsequence converging to a point of $K$ ([[thm-compact-iff-sequentially-compact-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]], [[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L3] Countable choice: for a family $(P_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of nonempty sets there is a function on $\mathbb{N}$ picking an element of each ([[def-countable-choice]]).

[L4] A strictly increasing index map satisfies $n_j \ge j$ ([[lem-index-map-grows]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L5] Archimedean property in reciprocal form: for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \eta$; and $0 < s \le t$ implies $1/t \le 1/s$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

[L6] Sequential criterion, the choice-free direction: if $f$ is continuous at $p \in K$ and $(z_j)$ has terms in $K$ with $z_j \to p$, then $f(z_j) \to f(p)$ ([[thm-sequential-criterion-for-continuity]], [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L7] Triangle inequality and absolute value: $|u + v| \le |u| + |v|$, $|{-u}| = |u|$, $|u| \ge 0$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L8] Convergence of real sequences is tested at rational $\varepsilon > 0$, and below every positive real lies a positive rational, so the test may equally be run at every real $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-real-limit]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose $f$ is not uniformly continuous on $K$. By [L1] fix a real $\varepsilon_0 > 0$ such that for every real $\delta > 0$ there are $x, x' \in K$ with $|x - x'| < \delta$ and $|f(x) - f(x')| \ge \varepsilon_0$. [L1, assume-contra]

2.1 For $k \in \mathbb{N}$ put $P_k := \{\, (x,x') \in K \times K \ : \ |x - x'| < 1/(k+1) \text{ and } |f(x) - f(x')| \ge \varepsilon_0 \,\}$. Since $1/(k+1) > 0$, step 1.1 makes every $P_k$ nonempty. [step 1.1, L5]

3.1 By [L3] applied to the family $(P_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ fix a function $k \mapsto (x_k, x'_k)$ with $(x_k, x'_k) \in P_k$ for every $k$. **This is the single use of countable choice in this proof.** [step 2.1, L3, choose]

4.1 $(x_k)$ is a sequence of reals with all terms in $K$, so by [L2] there are a strictly increasing $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ and $p \in K$ with $x_{n_j} \to p$. [step 3.1, L2, choose]

5.1 **The second sequence converges to $p$ as well.** Let a rational $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. By [L5] and [L8] fix $J_1$ with $1/(j+1) < \varepsilon/2$ for every $j \ge J_1$, and by step 4.1 fix $J_2$ with $|x_{n_j} - p| < \varepsilon/2$ for every $j \ge J_2$. For $j \ge \max\{J_1, J_2\}$, using $(x_{n_j}, x'_{n_j}) \in P_{n_j}$ and $n_j \ge j$ from [L4], we get $|x'_{n_j} - x_{n_j}| < 1/(n_j+1) \le 1/(j+1) < \varepsilon/2$, hence $|x'_{n_j} - p| \le |x'_{n_j} - x_{n_j}| + |x_{n_j} - p| < \varepsilon$ by [L7]. So $x'_{n_j} \to p$. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L4, L5, L7, L8]

6.1 The point $p$ lies in $K$ and $f$ is continuous at $p$, so [L6] applied to the two sequences of steps 4.1 and 5.1, both with terms in $K$, gives $f(x_{n_j}) \to f(p)$ and $f(x'_{n_j}) \to f(p)$. [step 4.1, step 5.1, L6]

7.1 By [L8] fix a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \varepsilon_0/2$, and by step 6.1 fix $J$ with $|f(x_{n_j}) - f(p)| < \varepsilon$ and $|f(x'_{n_j}) - f(p)| < \varepsilon$ for every $j \ge J$. For such $j$, [L7] gives $|f(x_{n_j}) - f(x'_{n_j})| \le |f(x_{n_j}) - f(p)| + |f(p) - f(x'_{n_j})| < 2\varepsilon < \varepsilon_0$. [step 6.1, L7, L8, choose]

8.1 But $(x_{n_j}, x'_{n_j}) \in P_{n_j}$ gives $|f(x_{n_j}) - f(x'_{n_j})| \ge \varepsilon_0$ for every $j$, which contradicts step 7.1. The assumption of step 1.1 is therefore false, and $f$ is uniformly continuous on $K$. [step 3.1, step 7.1, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where compactness is used, and where continuity is used.** Compactness is used once, in step 4.1, to extract a convergent subsequence; continuity is used once, in step 6.1, at the single point $p$ that the extraction produces. Neither can be weakened: $x \mapsto 1/x$ on $(0,1)$ is continuous on a bounded non-closed set and not uniformly continuous ([[cex-one-over-x-is-not-uniformly-continuous-on-the-unit-interval]]), and $x \mapsto x^{2}$ on $\mathbb{R}$ is continuous on a closed unbounded set and not uniformly continuous ([[cex-x-squared-is-not-uniformly-continuous-on-r]]).

- **The converse is sharp.** For every noncompact $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ that is bounded there is a continuous function on $E$ that is not uniformly continuous, and for every noncompact $E$ there is an unbounded continuous function and a bounded continuous one with no greatest value. That is [[thm-compactness-is-necessary-for-evt-and-uniform-continuity]], later on this page, and together with this theorem it says that compactness is exactly the hypothesis these results need.

- **The pairs, not the points, are what is chosen.** A common presentation selects two sequences separately and then extracts twice. Selecting the pair once, as above, keeps the count of choice applications at one and makes the second sequence's convergence a consequence rather than a second extraction.

## Statement

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. If $0 \in S$ and $\sigma(n) \in S$ whenever $n \in S$, then $S = \mathbb{N}$. Equivalently (property form): if a property $P$ satisfies $P(0)$ and ($P(n) \Rightarrow P(\sigma(n))$) for all $n$, then $P(n)$ holds for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. This is the induction principle, the basis of proof by induction.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $\mathbb{N} = \omega$ is the smallest inductive set ([[def-inductive-set]], [[def-natural-numbers]], [[lem-omega-smallest-inductive]]); $0 = \varnothing$, $\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$.

[L1] $\omega$ is contained in every inductive set ([[lem-omega-smallest-inductive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Suppose $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ with $0 = \varnothing \in S$ and ($x \in S \Rightarrow \sigma(x) = x \cup \{x\} \in S$). [given]

2.1 Then $S$ contains $\varnothing$ and is closed under $x \mapsto x \cup \{x\}$, so $S$ is an inductive set. [step 1.1]

3.1 $\mathbb{N} = \omega \subseteq S$ because $\omega$ is a subset of every inductive set. [L1, step 2.1]

4.1 With $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ by hypothesis, $S = \mathbb{N}$. [step 3.1, given]

5.1 The property form is the set case with $S = \{n \in \mathbb{N} : P(n)\}$: $P(0)$ and $P(n) \Rightarrow P(\sigma(n))$ give $0 \in S$ and $\sigma$-closure, so $S = \mathbb{N}$, i.e. $P$ holds for all $n$; conversely the set form is the property form applied to $P(n) :\equiv n \in S$, so the two are equivalent. [step 4.1] ∎

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]) and let

$$D \;:=\; \{\, x \in [a,b] \ : \ f \text{ is discontinuous at } x \,\}$$

([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-classification-of-discontinuities]]). Then

$$f \text{ is Riemann integrable on } [a,b] \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad D \text{ has measure zero}$$

([[def-darboux-integral]], [[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

**The choice cost, named.** The implication from integrability to $D$ being null
uses the Axiom of Countable Choice ([[def-countable-choice]]) exactly once,
through [[thm-countable-union-of-null-is-null]] at step 7.1: $D$ is exhibited as
the union of a sequence of null sets. The converse implication, from $D$ null to
integrability, is a theorem of ZF: it uses no choice principle at all.

**"Measure zero" here is the cover condition of
[[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]**, namely that for every $\varepsilon > 0$
there is a sequence of intervals covering $D$ of total length at most
$\varepsilon$. No outer measure, no measurable set and no Lebesgue integral is
used or needed; the criterion is a statement about interval covers throughout.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, a bounded $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $M_{+} > 0$ with $|f(x)| \le M_{+}$ for every $x \in [a,b]$, and $D$ as in the Statement.

[A1] The Axiom of Countable Choice, used only where [L11] is invoked ([[def-countable-choice]]).

[L1] For a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[a,b]$: $n \ge 1$, $\Delta_i = t_{i+1}-t_i > 0$, $\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = b-a$, $I_i = [t_i,t_{i+1}] \subseteq [a,b]$, and appending a point $y > t_n$ to a partition of $[a,t_n]$ gives a partition of $[a,y]$ whose subintervals are the old ones together with $[t_n,y]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L2] $U(f,P) - L(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}(M_i-m_i)\Delta_i$, $M_i - m_i = \omega_f(I_i)$, and $0 \le M_i - m_i \le 2M_{+}$ ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-oscillation]]).

[L3] Riemann's criterion: a bounded $f$ is integrable if and only if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a partition $P$ with $U(f,P)-L(f,P) < \varepsilon$ ([[thm-riemann-criterion]]).

[L4] Oscillation: $\omega_f(S) \le \omega_f(T)$ for $S \subseteq T \subseteq [a,b]$; $0 \le \omega_f(x) \le \omega_f([a,b] \cap N_\rho(x))$ for every real $\rho > 0$ and every $x \in [a,b]$; $\omega_f(x)$ is the infimum of those values over $\rho > 0$; and since $f$ is bounded every one of these values is a real number in $[0, 2M_{+}]$ ([[def-oscillation]], [[def-extended-reals]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L5] $f$ is continuous at $x \in [a,b]$ if and only if $\omega_f(x) = 0$; hence $D = \{x \in [a,b] : \omega_f(x) > 0\}$ ([[thm-continuity-iff-oscillation-zero]], [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L6] For every real $\sigma > 0$ there is a closed $G \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ with $\{x \in [a,b] : \omega_f(x) \ge \sigma\} = [a,b] \cap G$ ([[lem-oscillation-superlevel-sets-are-closed]]).

[L7] A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is compact exactly when it is closed and bounded; $[a,b]$ is closed and bounded; an intersection of closed sets is closed; every open interval is an open set ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], [[def-interval]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L8] $A$ has content zero when for every real $\tau > 0$ there are $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and reals $c_0 \le e_0, \dots, c_m \le e_m$ with $A \subseteq \bigcup_{j \le m}[c_j,e_j]$ and $\sum_{j \le m}(e_j - c_j) \le \tau$; $A$ has measure zero when the same holds with a sequence of intervals and every partial total length at most $\tau$; a subset of a null set is null ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

[L9] A set of content zero has measure zero ([[lem-content-zero-implies-null]]), and for a **compact** set the two notions coincide ([[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]]).

[L10] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $k \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(k) < \eta$; $\iota(k) > 0$ for $k \ge 1$, $\iota$ is nonnegative and nondecreasing on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L11] Assuming [A1], the union of a sequence of null subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ is null ([[thm-countable-union-of-null-is-null]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L12] Finite sums: splitting, additivity, scaling, monotonicity in the terms, and telescoping ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]). Also the interchange of two finite sums, $\sum_{i<n}\sum_{j<p}c_{i,j} = \sum_{j<p}\sum_{i<n}c_{i,j}$ for any doubly indexed family of reals; below it is applied with $p := m+1$, since $\sum_{j \le m}$ abbreviates $\sum_{j<m+1}$. That identity is **not** one of the six clauses of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] and is therefore proved here, by induction on $p$ with $n$ held fixed ([[thm-induction-principle]]). At $p = 0$ each inner sum $\sum_{j<0}c_{i,j}$ is $0$ by the recursion clause of [[def-finite-sum]], so the left side is $\sum_{i<n}0 = 0$ by clause 2 of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] taken with $\lambda = 0$, while the right side is an empty sum and so is $0$ as well. Passing from $p$ to $p+1$, the recursion clause and clause 1 of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] give $\sum_{i<n}\sum_{j<p+1}c_{i,j} = \sum_{i<n}\bigl(\sum_{j<p}c_{i,j} + c_{i,p}\bigr) = \sum_{i<n}\sum_{j<p}c_{i,j} + \sum_{i<n}c_{i,p}$, which by the induction hypothesis is $\sum_{j<p}\sum_{i<n}c_{i,j} + \sum_{i<n}c_{i,p} = \sum_{j<p+1}\sum_{i<n}c_{i,j}$, again by the recursion clause.

[L13] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]); every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ bounded above has a supremum ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L14] Ordered-field arithmetic and the absolute value: adding a constant and multiplying by a positive quantity preserve an inequality; the order is total and transitive; an open interval is order-convex ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-interval]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For a real $\sigma > 0$ put $E_\sigma := \{\, x \in [a,b] : \omega_f(x) \ge \sigma \,\}$. By [L5], $E_\sigma \subseteq D$ for every $\sigma > 0$. [L4, L5, construct]

2.1 **Each $E_\sigma$ has content zero, assuming $f$ integrable.** Let $\sigma > 0$ and $\tau > 0$ be real. By [L3] fix a partition $P = (n,t)$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \sigma\tau \cdot 2^{-1}$. Let $B := \{\, i < n : (t_i,t_{i+1}) \cap E_\sigma \ne \varnothing \,\}$ and put $\chi_i := 1$ for $i \in B$ and $\chi_i := 0$ otherwise. [step 1.1, L3, L14, choose, construct]

2.2 **The exhaustion of $D$.** Put $\sigma_k := 1/\iota(k+1)$ for $k \in \mathbb{N}$, a positive real by [L10]. Then $D = \bigcup_{k \in \mathbb{N}} E_{\sigma_k}$. For the inclusion from left to right, let $x \in D$, so $\omega_f(x) > 0$ by [L5] and $\omega_f(x)$ is a real by [L4]; if $\omega_f(x) \ge 1 = \sigma_0$ then $x \in E_{\sigma_0}$, and otherwise [L10] gives a natural $k+1 \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(k+1) < \omega_f(x)$, so $x \in E_{\sigma_k}$. For the reverse inclusion, $x \in E_{\sigma_k}$ gives $\omega_f(x) \ge \sigma_k > 0$, hence $x \in D$ by [L5]. [step 1.1, L4, L5, L10, L14]

2.3 **The converse; this half of the proof is steps 2.3, 3.2, 4.2, 5.2, 6.2, 7.2, 8.1, 9.1, 10.1, 11.1, 12.1 and 13.1, and its symbols are its own.** Assume $D$ null and let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. Put $\sigma' := \varepsilon \cdot \bigl(2(b-a)\bigr)^{-1}$ and $\tau' := \varepsilon \cdot \bigl(8M_{+}\bigr)^{-1}$, both positive by [L14]. By step 1.1 and [L8], $E_{\sigma'} \subseteq D$ is null. [step 1.1, given, L8, L14]

3.1 For $i \in B$ one has $M_i - m_i \ge \sigma$: fix $x \in (t_i,t_{i+1}) \cap E_\sigma$; since $(t_i,t_{i+1})$ is open there is a real $\rho > 0$ with $N_\rho(x) \subseteq (t_i,t_{i+1})$, so $[a,b] \cap N_\rho(x) \subseteq I_i$ and [L4] gives $\sigma \le \omega_f(x) \le \omega_f([a,b] \cap N_\rho(x)) \le \omega_f(I_i) = M_i - m_i$ by [L2]. [step 2.1, L1, L2, L4, L7, choose]

3.2 $E_{\sigma'}$ is compact: by [L6] there is a closed $G$ with $E_{\sigma'} = [a,b] \cap G$, an intersection of two closed sets, hence closed; and $E_{\sigma'} \subseteq [a,b]$ is bounded. So [L7] applies. [step 2.3, L6, L7]

4.1 Hence $\sigma\chi_i\Delta_i \le (M_i - m_i)\Delta_i$ for every $i < n$, the case $i \notin B$ because both $M_i - m_i \ge 0$ and $\Delta_i > 0$. Summing and using [L12] and [L2]: $\sigma \sum_{i<n}\chi_i\Delta_i \le U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \sigma\tau \cdot 2^{-1}$, so $\lambda := \sum_{i<n}\chi_i\Delta_i < \tau \cdot 2^{-1}$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L2, L12, L14]

4.2 By [L9] applied to the compact null set $E_{\sigma'}$, it has content zero, so by [L8] there are $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and reals $c_0 \le e_0, \dots, c_m \le e_m$ with $E_{\sigma'} \subseteq \bigcup_{j \le m}[c_j,e_j]$ and $\sum_{j\le m}(e_j-c_j) \le \tau' \cdot 2^{-1}$. Put $\mu := \tau' \cdot \bigl(4(\iota(m)+1)\bigr)^{-1} > 0$ and $O_j := (c_j - \mu,\ e_j + \mu)$, an open interval containing $[c_j,e_j]$, of length $(e_j - c_j) + 2\mu$. Then $\sum_{j\le m}\bigl((e_j-c_j)+2\mu\bigr) \le \tau' \cdot 2^{-1} + 2\mu(\iota(m)+1) = \tau' \cdot 2^{-1} + \tau' \cdot 2^{-1} = \tau'$, by [L12] and [L10]. [step 2.3, step 3.2, L8, L9, L10, L12, L14, construct]

5.1 $E_\sigma$ is covered by the finite list of $2n+1$ closed intervals $[p_j,q_j]$, $j \le 2n$, defined by $[p_j,q_j] := [t_j,t_{j+1}]$ for $j < n$ with $j \in B$, $[p_j,q_j] := [a,a]$ for $j < n$ with $j \notin B$, and $[p_j,q_j] := [t_{j-n},t_{j-n}]$ for $n \le j \le 2n$: indeed a point of $E_\sigma$ lies in $[a,b]$, hence is one of $t_0,\dots,t_n$ or lies in some $(t_i,t_{i+1})$, and in the latter case $i \in B$. Its total length is $\sum_{j \le 2n}(q_j - p_j) = \sum_{i<n}\chi_i\Delta_i + 0 = \lambda < \tau$, by splitting the sum at $n$ ([L12]). [step 2.1, step 4.1, L1, L12, L14, construct]

5.2 **The family of good intervals.** Let $\mathcal{W}$ be the set of all open intervals $(u,v)$ with $u < v$ such that either $(u,v) \subseteq O_j$ for some $j \le m$, or $\omega_f([a,b]\cap(u,v)) < \sigma'$. Every $x \in [a,b]$ lies in a member: if $x \in E_{\sigma'}$ then $x \in [c_j,e_j] \subseteq O_j$ for some $j \le m$ by step 4.2, and $O_j$ is itself a member; and if $x \notin E_{\sigma'}$ then $\omega_f(x) < \sigma'$, so by [L4] some real $\rho > 0$ has $\omega_f([a,b]\cap N_\rho(x)) < \sigma'$, and $N_\rho(x) = (x-\rho,x+\rho)$ is a member containing $x$. [step 4.2, L4, L7, L14, construct]

6.1 As $\tau > 0$ was arbitrary, $E_\sigma$ has content zero by [L8], hence measure zero by [L9]; this used only that $f$ is integrable. [step 2.1, step 5.1, L8, L9]

6.2 **Cousin's construction: a partition each of whose subintervals lies in a member of $\mathcal{W}$.** Let $S$ be the set of $y \in (a,b]$ such that some partition of $[a,y]$ has every subinterval contained in a member of $\mathcal{W}$. $S$ is nonempty: by step 5.2 fix $(\alpha,\beta) \in \mathcal{W}$ with $a \in (\alpha,\beta)$ and put $y_0 := \min\{(a+b)\cdot 2^{-1},\ (a+\beta)\cdot 2^{-1}\}$, so $a < y_0 \le b$, $y_0 < \beta$ and $\alpha < a$; the one-subinterval partition of $[a,y_0]$ has $[a,y_0] \subseteq (\alpha,\beta)$, so $y_0 \in S$. Also $S$ is bounded above by $b$, so $s := \sup S$ exists by [L13] and $a < y_0 \le s \le b$. [step 5.2, L1, L13, L14, choose]

7.1 **Integrability implies $D$ null.** Assume $f$ integrable. By step 6.1 each $E_{\sigma_k}$ is null, and $k \mapsto E_{\sigma_k}$ is a sequence of subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, so [L11] applies and $\bigcup_k E_{\sigma_k} = D$ is null by step 2.2. This is the only use of [A1] in the proof. [step 6.1, step 2.2, A1, L11]

7.2 $s = b$. By step 5.2 fix $(\alpha',\beta') \in \mathcal{W}$ with $s \in (\alpha',\beta')$. Since $\sup S = s > \alpha'$ there is $x \in S$ with $x > \alpha'$, and $x \le s$. Suppose $s < b$ and choose a real $y$ with $s < y < \min\{b, \beta'\}$, possible because $s < b$ and $s < \beta'$. Then $\alpha' < x \le s < y < \beta'$, so $[x,y] \subseteq (\alpha',\beta')$, and appending $y$ to a partition of $[a,x]$ witnessing $x \in S$ gives one for $[a,y]$ by [L1]; hence $y \in S$ with $y > \sup S$, which is impossible. [step 6.2, L1, L13, L14, choose]

8.1 $b \in S$. By step 5.2 fix $(\alpha'',\beta'') \in \mathcal{W}$ with $b \in (\alpha'',\beta'')$. Since $\sup S = b > \alpha''$ there is $x \in S$ with $x > \alpha''$ and $x \le b$. If $x = b$ there is nothing to prove; otherwise $\alpha'' < x < b < \beta''$ gives $[x,b] \subseteq (\alpha'',\beta'')$, and appending $b$ as in step 7.2 puts $b$ in $S$. So there is a partition $P' = (n',t')$ of $[a,b]$, with subintervals $I'_i$ and lengths $\Delta'_i$ for $i < n'$, every subinterval of which lies in a member of $\mathcal{W}$. [step 5.2, step 7.2, L1, L13, L14, choose]

9.1 **Good and bad subintervals.** Write $M'_i := \sup f[I'_i]$ and $m'_i := \inf f[I'_i]$. Call $i < n'$ **good** when $I'_i \subseteq W$ for some $W = (u,v) \in \mathcal{W}$ with $\omega_f([a,b]\cap(u,v)) < \sigma'$, and **bad** otherwise. For a good $i$, $I'_i \subseteq [a,b] \cap W$, so $M'_i - m'_i = \omega_f(I'_i) \le \omega_f([a,b]\cap W) < \sigma'$ by [L2] and [L4]. For a bad $i$, step 8.1 supplies a member containing $I'_i$, and it is not of the second kind, so $I'_i \subseteq O_j$ for some $j \le m$. [step 8.1, L1, L2, L4]

10.1 **Bounding the bad lengths.** For $j \le m$ put $J_j := \{\, i < n' : c_j - \mu \le t'_i \text{ and } t'_{i+1} \le e_j + \mu \,\}$ and $h^{j}_i := \Delta'_i$ for $i \in J_j$, $h^{j}_i := 0$ otherwise; a bad $i$ lies in some $J_j$ by step 9.1. Each $J_j$ consists of consecutive indices, since $i < i^{\dagger} < i^{\ddagger}$ with $i,i^{\ddagger} \in J_j$ gives $c_j - \mu \le t'_i \le t'_{i^{\dagger}}$ and $t'_{i^{\dagger}+1} \le t'_{i^{\ddagger}+1} \le e_j + \mu$. [step 9.1, L1, L14, construct]

11.1 $\sum_{i<n'}h^{j}_i \le (e_j - c_j) + 2\mu$ for each $j \le m$: the sum is $0$ when $J_j = \varnothing$; otherwise let $p := \min J_j$ and let $q$ be the least natural with $q > p$ and $q \notin J_j$, which exists by [L13] since $n' \notin J_j$, so that $J_j = \{\, i : p \le i < q \,\}$ by step 10.1. Splitting the sum at $p$ and at $q$ and discarding the vanishing outer parts, then telescoping ([L12]), gives $\sum_{i<n'}h^{j}_i = \sum_{i=p}^{q-1}\Delta'_i = t'_q - t'_p \le (e_j+\mu) - (c_j-\mu)$, using $p \in J_j$ and $q-1 \in J_j$. [step 10.1, L12, L13, L14]

12.1 Put $\beta_i := \Delta'_i$ for bad $i$ and $\beta_i := 0$ for good $i$. Then $\beta_i \le \sum_{j \le m}h^{j}_i$ pointwise by step 10.1, all terms being nonnegative, so by [L12] and step 11.1, $\sum_{i<n'}\beta_i \le \sum_{j\le m}\sum_{i<n'}h^{j}_i \le \sum_{j\le m}\bigl((e_j-c_j)+2\mu\bigr) \le \tau'$, the last step by step 4.2. [step 4.2, step 10.1, step 11.1, L12, L14]

13.1 For every $i < n'$, $(M'_i-m'_i)\Delta'_i \le \sigma'\Delta'_i + 2M_{+}\beta_i$: for good $i$ by step 9.1 and $\beta_i \ge 0$, for bad $i$ by $M'_i - m'_i \le 2M_{+}$ from [L2] and $\beta_i = \Delta'_i$. Summing over $i < n'$ and using [L12], [L1] and step 12.1: $U(f,P')-L(f,P') \le \sigma'(b-a) + 2M_{+}\tau' = \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1} + \varepsilon \cdot 4^{-1} < \varepsilon$. [step 2.3, step 9.1, step 12.1, L1, L2, L12, L14]

14.1 The real $\varepsilon > 0$ of step 2.3 was arbitrary and step 13.1 produced a partition with $U - L < \varepsilon$, so $f$ is integrable by [L3]. With step 7.1 this proves both implications, and the criterion is established; the forward half is steps 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1, 6.1 and 7.1, working with $\sigma, \tau, P, B, \chi, \lambda$, and the converse half is the steps named in step 2.3, working with $\sigma', \tau', P', \mathcal{W}, S$. [step 7.1, step 2.3, step 13.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the two halves cost.** The forward half is a single application of Riemann's criterion for each threshold $\sigma$, plus the countable union; the backward half is where all the work is, and it is entirely a covering argument: the bad set is compact and null, hence of content zero, hence coverable by finitely many open intervals of small total length, and the rest of $[a,b]$ is chopped up by Cousin's construction into pieces of oscillation below $\sigma$.

- **Why Cousin's construction and not a Lebesgue number.** Step 6.2 to step 8.1 build the partition directly from the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$: the set of right endpoints reachable by a good partition is nonempty and bounded, and its supremum is shown to be $b$ and to be attained. This uses no sequence, no subsequence and no choice, whereas the usual Lebesgue-number argument selects a bad interval for each $n$ and then extracts a convergent subsequence, which costs countable choice. Since the whole point of this item's choice ledger is that the backward implication is a ZF theorem, the choice-free route is the one taken.

- **The superlevel sets, not the discontinuity set, are what is covered.** $D$ itself is in general not closed, so [[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]] does not apply to it; each $E_\sigma$ **is** closed in $[a,b]$ ([[lem-oscillation-superlevel-sets-are-closed]]) and bounded, and that is exactly the hypothesis needed. The passage back from the $E_{\sigma_k}$ to $D$ is step 2.2, and it is where the countable union appears.

- **The exhaustion $D = \bigcup_k E_{1/\iota(k+1)}$ is derived here, and it is also claim 1 of [[thm-discontinuity-set-is-f-sigma]].** When this proof was written that theorem stated only the descriptive form — $D$ as the trace on the domain of an $F_\sigma$ subset of $\mathbb{R}$ — which is not the pointwise identity step 2.2 needs, so the identity was derived inline from [[thm-continuity-iff-oscillation-zero]] and the Archimedean property. The exhaustion has since been stated there as claim 1, precisely because several items were quoting it from a theorem that did not assert it. The inline derivation is retained because it is three lines and keeps this item's choice ledger readable in one place; citing claim 1 instead would be equally correct.

- **Both directions are sharp in the obvious sense.** The indicator of the Cantor set is discontinuous on an uncountable null set and is integrable; the indicator of the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set is discontinuous on a nowhere dense set that is not null and is not integrable ([[fs-integrability-is-equivalent-to-a-nowhere-dense-discontinuity-set]]). So neither cardinality nor category decides integrability; only measure does.

## Statement

Every complete ordered field $F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) is Archimedean:
for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$,
where $n \cdot 1_F$ is the canonical natural of the ordered field $F$
([[def-ordered-field]]). Equivalently, the canonical naturals are cofinal in $F$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $F$; write $A = \{\, n \cdot 1_F : n \ge 1 \,\}$ for the set of its canonical naturals.

[L1] Least-upper-bound property: every nonempty $S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound $\sup S \in F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Each canonical natural satisfies $n \cdot 1_F > 0$, one has $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L3] $0 < 1_F$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $F$ is not Archimedean: there is some $x \in F$ with $n \cdot 1_F \le x$ for all $n \ge 1$, that is, $x$ is an upper bound of $A$. [assume-contra]

2.1 The set $A$ is nonempty, since $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F \in A$, and it is bounded above by $x$. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 By the least-upper-bound property, $A$ has a least upper bound $s = \sup A \in F$. [step 2.1, L1]

4.1 Since $1_F > 0$, we have $s - 1_F < s$; as $s$ is the least upper bound, $s - 1_F$ is not an upper bound of $A$. [step 3.1, L3]

5.1 Hence there is some $m \ge 1$ with $m \cdot 1_F > s - 1_F$. [step 4.1]

6.1 Adding $1_F$ to both sides, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F > s$. [step 5.1, L2]

7.1 But $(m+1) \cdot 1_F \in A$, so $(m+1) \cdot 1_F \le s$ because $s$ is an upper bound of $A$, contradicting 6.1. [step 6.1, step 3.1, L2]

8.1 The assumption is therefore untenable, so $F$ is Archimedean. [step 7.1, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Statement

Let open and closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ be as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

1. **Arbitrary unions of open sets are open.** If $\mathcal{U}$ is any family of
   open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, then $\bigcup \mathcal{U}$ is open.
2. **Finite intersections of open sets are open.** If $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
   $U_0, \dots, U_n$ are open, then $U_0 \cap \dots \cap U_n$ is open.
3. **Arbitrary intersections of closed sets are closed.** If $\mathcal{F}$ is a
   nonempty family of closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, then
   $\bigcap \mathcal{F}$ is closed.
4. **Finite unions of closed sets are closed.** If $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
   $F_0, \dots, F_n$ are closed, then $F_0 \cup \dots \cup F_n$ is closed.

The word *finite* in claims 2 and 4 is not decoration: an arbitrary
intersection of open sets need not be open, and dually an arbitrary union
of closed sets need not be closed; the remarks below say where that is settled.
Claim 3 asks $\mathcal{F}$ to be nonempty
only so that $\bigcap \mathcal{F}$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ without appeal to
a convention about the empty intersection.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A family $\mathcal{U}$ of open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, with $\bigcup \mathcal{U} = \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \in U \text{ for some } U \in \mathcal{U} \,\}$; a natural number $n$ and open sets $U_0, \dots, U_n$; a nonempty family $\mathcal{F}$ of closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, with $\bigcap \mathcal{F} = \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \in F \text{ for every } F \in \mathcal{F} \,\}$; and closed sets $F_0, \dots, F_n$.

[A1] De Morgan's laws in the ambient set theory: for a nonempty family $\mathcal{G}$ of subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{R} \setminus \bigcap \mathcal{G} = \bigcup \{\, \mathbb{R} \setminus G : G \in \mathcal{G} \,\}$, and $\mathbb{R} \setminus (G_0 \cup \dots \cup G_n) = (\mathbb{R} \setminus G_0) \cap \dots \cap (\mathbb{R} \setminus G_n)$. Also $\mathbb{R} \setminus (\mathbb{R} \setminus G) = G$.

[L1] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; $F$ is closed when $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L2] $N_\varepsilon(x) = \{\, y : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}$, and $0 < \delta \le \varepsilon$ gives $N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] Every nonempty finite set of reals has a minimum, so $\min\{\varepsilon, \eta\}$ is defined and equals one of the two entries, and is $\le$ both ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $x \in \bigcup \mathcal{U}$. Then $x \in U$ for some $U \in \mathcal{U}$, and $U$ is open, so there is $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{U}$; as $x$ was arbitrary, $\bigcup \mathcal{U}$ is open, which is claim 1. [given, L1, choose]

1.2 Now let $U$ and $V$ be open and let $x \in U \cap V$; fix $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$ and $\eta > 0$ with $N_\eta(x) \subseteq V$. [given, L1, choose]

2.1 Put $\delta := \min\{\varepsilon, \eta\}$, which is one of $\varepsilon, \eta$ and hence $> 0$, and satisfies $\delta \le \varepsilon$ and $\delta \le \eta$; then $N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$ and $N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\eta(x) \subseteq V$, so $N_\delta(x) \subseteq U \cap V$, and as $x$ was arbitrary $U \cap V$ is open. [step 1.2, L2, L3]

2.2 The family $\{\, \mathbb{R} \setminus F : F \in \mathcal{F} \,\}$ consists of open sets by [L1], so its union is open by step 1.1; that union is $\mathbb{R} \setminus \bigcap \mathcal{F}$ by [A1], so $\bigcap \mathcal{F}$ is closed, which is claim 3. [step 1.1, A1, L1]

3.1 Claim 2 now follows by induction on $n$: for $n = 0$ the intersection is $U_0$, which is open by hypothesis; and if $W := U_0 \cap \dots \cap U_n$ is open then $U_0 \cap \dots \cap U_{n+1} = W \cap U_{n+1}$ is an intersection of two open sets, hence open by step 2.1. [step 2.1, given]

4.1 Each $\mathbb{R} \setminus F_i$ is open by [L1], so $(\mathbb{R} \setminus F_0) \cap \dots \cap (\mathbb{R} \setminus F_n)$ is open by step 3.1; that set is $\mathbb{R} \setminus (F_0 \cup \dots \cup F_n)$ by [A1], so $F_0 \cup \dots \cup F_n$ is closed, which is claim 4. [step 3.1, A1, L1]

5.1 Claims 1, 2, 3 and 4 are steps 1.1, 3.1, 2.2 and 4.1 respectively, so arbitrary unions and finite intersections of open sets are open, and arbitrary intersections and finite unions of closed sets are closed. [step 1.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, step 4.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Completeness plays no part.** Nothing above uses the least-upper-bound
  property, or even the Archimedean property: the only facts about $\mathbb{R}$
  the proof touches are the definition of a neighbourhood, its monotonicity in
  the radius, and the comparison of two positive radii. What needs completeness
  is not the algebra of open sets but the theorems about compactness that come
  later.

- **Why finiteness cannot be dropped in claim 2.** The minimum taken in step 2.1
  is a minimum of finitely many positive radii, and it is positive precisely
  because it is one of them ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]). An infinite family of
  positive radii has an infimum that may be $0$, and then no positive $\delta$
  survives. That is exactly what happens for the shrinking intervals of
  [[fs-arbitrary-intersection-of-open-is-open]], whose named witness is
  [[cex-intersection-of-shrinking-intervals-not-open]].

- **The four claims are a rewriting of two.** Claims 3 and 4 are claims 1 and 2
  read through complementation, and closedness is *defined* by complementation
  ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), so no separate argument about closed sets is
  possible or needed.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]). Then $f$ is Darboux integrable on $[a,b]$
([[def-darboux-integral]]) **if and only if**

$$\text{for every real } \varepsilon > 0 \text{ there is a partition } P \text{ of } [a,b] \text{ with } U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$$

([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

**This is the criterion every later integrability proof on this page uses.** It
replaces a statement about a supremum and an infimum over all partitions, which
cannot be checked directly, by the exhibition of a **single** partition for each
$\varepsilon$. The criterion says nothing about the value of the integral; that
is located separately, by [[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]], between $L(f,P)$
and $U(f,P)$ for the same $P$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and a bounded $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$.

[A1] The criterion: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a partition $P$ of $[a,b]$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$.

[L1] $L(f,P) \le \underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,P)$ for every partition $P$; $\underline{\int_a^b} f = \sup \mathcal{L}$ and $\overline{\int_a^b} f = \inf \mathcal{U}$ over the nonempty sets $\mathcal{L}$ of lower sums and $\mathcal{U}$ of upper sums; $f$ is integrable exactly when the two are equal ([[def-darboux-integral]], [[def-darboux-sums]]).

[L2] $\varepsilon$-characterisation of the supremum: if $u = \sup S$ with $S$ nonempty then for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $s \in S$ with $s > u - \varepsilon$ ([[lem-sup-epsilon]]). Dually, if $\ell = \inf S$ then for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $s \in S$ with $s < \ell + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-inf-epsilon]], [[def-infimum]]).

[L3] If $P'$ refines $P$ then $L(f,P) \le L(f,P')$ and $U(f,P') \le U(f,P)$; the common refinement $P_1 \vee P_2$ refines both $P_1$ and $P_2$ ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L4] Ordered-field arithmetic: adding a constant to both sides preserves an inequality, the order is total and transitive, and $t \cdot 2^{-1} > 0$ for $t > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Write $D := \overline{\int_a^b} f - \underline{\int_a^b} f$, a real number with $D \ge 0$ by [L1]; $f$ is integrable exactly when $D = 0$. [L1]

1.2 **The criterion is sufficient.** Assume [A1] and let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. Fix a partition $P$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$. By [L1], $\underline{\int_a^b} f \ge L(f,P)$ and $\overline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,P)$, so $D \le U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$. [A1, L1, L4, choose]

1.3 **The criterion is necessary; this half of the proof is steps 1.3, 2.2 and 3.1, and its symbols are its own.** Assume $f$ is integrable and write $I$ for the common value $\underline{\int_a^b} f = \overline{\int_a^b} f$. Let a real $\eta > 0$ be given; then $\eta \cdot 2^{-1} > 0$ by [L4]. [L1, L4]

2.1 So $0 \le D < \varepsilon$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$. If $D > 0$, taking $\varepsilon := D$ gives $D < D$, which is false; hence $D = 0$ and $f$ is integrable by step 1.1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L4]

2.2 By [L2] applied to $\mathcal{L}$, whose supremum is $I$, there is a partition $P_1$ with $L(f,P_1) > I - \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$; by [L2] applied to $\mathcal{U}$, whose infimum is $I$, there is a partition $P_2$ with $U(f,P_2) < I + \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$. [step 1.3, L1, L2, choose]

3.1 Put $P_{\ast} := P_1 \vee P_2$, which refines both by [L3]. Then $L(f,P_{\ast}) \ge L(f,P_1) > I - \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$ and $U(f,P_{\ast}) \le U(f,P_2) < I + \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$, so $U(f,P_{\ast}) - L(f,P_{\ast}) < \eta$ by [L4]. Since $\eta > 0$ was arbitrary, the criterion holds. [step 2.2, L3, L4]

4.1 Steps 1.2 and 2.1 give the implication from the criterion to integrability, and steps 1.3, 2.2 and 3.1 give the converse; the two halves are independent and use no symbol in common, and together they are the stated equivalence. [step 2.1, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The strict inequality is not essential.** Requiring $U(f,P) - L(f,P) \le \varepsilon$ for every $\varepsilon > 0$ defines the same condition, since a partition working for $\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$ works strictly for $\varepsilon$. Statements below use whichever form is convenient and no consequence turns on the difference.

- **The common refinement is where the two partitions are reconciled.** Step 2.2 produces one partition good for the lower sum and another good for the upper sum, and there is no reason for them to be the same. [[lem-refinement-inequalities]] is exactly what allows a single partition to inherit both properties, and it is the only place in this proof where anything beyond the definitions is used.

- **No choice principle is used.** Steps 1.2, 2.2 and 3.1 instantiate finitely many existential statements, which is ordinary first-order reasoning. See [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].

## Statement

Every nonempty subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ has a least element: there is $\ell \in S$ with $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A nonempty subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. Define $T = \{\, n \in \mathbb{N} : \text{every } m \text{ with } m \le n \text{ satisfies } m \notin S \,\}$ (informally, no element of $S$ is $\le n$).

[L1] Induction principle: a subset of $\mathbb{N}$ that contains $0$ and is closed under $\sigma$ equals $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L2] $m < n \iff \sigma(m) \le n$; consequently no $k$ satisfies $n < k < \sigma(n)$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]).

[L3] Exactly one of $s < n$, $s = n$, $n < s$ holds ([[lem-nat-trichotomy]]); and $n < s \iff \sigma(n) \le s$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]).

[L4] $\sigma$ is injective (Peano axiom P2) ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]).

[L5] $\sigma(a) + i = \sigma(a + i)$ for all $a, i$ (the left successor law, [[lem-nat-add-successor-left]]).

[L6] $0 + k = k$ for all $k$ ([[lem-nat-add-identity]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose $S$ is nonempty but has no least element. [assume-contra]

1.2 If $m < \sigma(n)$ then $m \le n$: by [L2] applied to $m$ and $\sigma(n)$ we get $\sigma(m) \le \sigma(n)$, say $\sigma(m) + i = \sigma(n)$; then $\sigma(m + i) = \sigma(m) + i = \sigma(n)$ [L5], so $m + i = n$ by injectivity [L4], hence $m \le n$. [L2, L4, L5]

2.1 First, $0 \in T$: if $0 \in S$ then $0 \le s$ for all $s \in S$, since $0 + s = s$ [L6], making $0$ a least element, contrary to the assumption; hence $0 \notin S$; moreover $m \le 0$ forces $m = 0$, because $m \ne 0$ would give $0 < m$ (as $0 + m = m$ [L6] with $m \ne 0$) while $m \le 0$ gives $m < 0$, and [L3] admits at most one of these; so every $m \le 0$ lies outside $S$. [step 1.1, L3, L6, given]

2.2 Next, $T$ is closed under $\sigma$: assume $n \in T$; if $\sigma(n) \in S$ then no $s \in S$ satisfies $s < \sigma(n)$ (else $s \le n$ by step 1.2, so $s \notin S$ because $n \in T$, a contradiction), hence $\sigma(n) \le s$ for all $s \in S$ by [L3], making $\sigma(n)$ a least element, contrary to the assumption; therefore $\sigma(n) \notin S$, and any $m$ with $m \le \sigma(n)$ satisfies $m = \sigma(n)$ or $m \ne \sigma(n)$; in the second case $m \le \sigma(n)$ together with $m \ne \sigma(n)$ gives $m < \sigma(n)$ by the definition of the strict order, hence $m \le n$ by step 1.2 and $m \notin S$ because $n \in T$, while in the first case $m = \sigma(n) \notin S$; so every $m \le \sigma(n)$ lies outside $S$, giving $\sigma(n) \in T$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L3]

3.1 By the induction principle [L1], from $0 \in T$ and closure under $\sigma$, $T = \mathbb{N}$; then for every $n$, taking $m = n \le n$ shows $n \notin S$, so $S = \varnothing$, contradicting nonemptiness; therefore $S$ has a least element. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L1, discharge-contradiction] ∎
