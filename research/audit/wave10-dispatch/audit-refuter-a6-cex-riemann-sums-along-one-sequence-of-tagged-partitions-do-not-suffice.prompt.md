## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` proof, actively search for a counterexample. A false
public claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or
materially inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is
nonfatal.

Return no more than 450 words, exactly in this shape:

## Statement refuted

**Refuted:** that a bounded $f$ on $[a,b]$ is Riemann integrable with integral
$I$ as soon as there is **one** sequence $(P_N,\xi^N)$ of tagged partitions with
$\|P_N\| \to 0$ and $S(f,P_N,\xi^N) \to I$
([[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

The witness is again the Dirichlet function on $[0,1]$
([[def-dirichlet-and-thomae-functions]]). Take $P_N := U_N$, the uniform
partition into $N \ge 1$ parts, and tag each subinterval by its left endpoint
$\xi^N_i := \iota(i)/\iota(N)$, a rational. Then

$$\|U_N\| = \frac{1}{\iota(N)} \longrightarrow 0, \qquad S(\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}, U_N, \xi^N) = 1 \ \text{ for every } N \ge 1,$$

so the Riemann sums converge, to $1$; and yet
$\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ is not Riemann integrable on $[0,1]$
([[cex-dirichlet-is-not-riemann-integrable]]).

**What this shows about [[thm-darboux-equals-riemann]].** Condition 2 there
quantifies over **every** tagged partition of mesh below $\delta$, tags included,
and the quantifier cannot be replaced by the existence of one good sequence.
Tagging the very same partition by irrationals instead gives Riemann sum $0$, so
for each $N$ the two taggings of $U_N$ give the two values $1$ and $0$; no real
number is within $1/2$ of both.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $g : [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ with $g(x) = 1$ for rational $x$ and $g(x) = 0$ for irrational $x$; for $N \ge 1$ the uniform partition $U_N = (N,t)$ of $[0,1]$ with $t_i = \iota(i)/\iota(N)$ and $\Delta_i = 1/\iota(N)$; and the tagging $\xi^N$ with $\xi^N_i := t_i$ for $i < N$.

[A1] The refuted claim: if some sequence of tagged partitions of $[0,1]$ has meshes tending to $0$ and Riemann sums tending to $I$, then $g$ is Riemann integrable with integral $I$.

[L1] For $U_N$: $t_i = \iota(i)/\iota(N) \in [0,1]$, $t_i < t_{i+1}$, $\Delta_i = 1/\iota(N)$, $\sum_{i<N}\Delta_i = 1$, and $\|U_N\| = 1/\iota(N)$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-interval]]).

[L2] $\xi^N_i := t_i \in I_i$ defines a tagging of $U_N$, and $S(g,U_N,\xi^N) = \sum_{i<N}g(\xi^N_i)\Delta_i$ ([[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]]).

[L3] Each $t_i = \iota(i)/\iota(N)$ is rational, being a quotient of canonical naturals with $\iota(N) > 0$; hence $g(t_i) = 1$ ([[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[def-dirichlet-and-thomae-functions]]).

[L4] Finite sums: scaling and $\sum_{i<N}1 \cdot \Delta_i = \sum_{i<N}\Delta_i$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L5] A constant sequence converges to its value; and for every real $\eta > 0$ there is $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N) < \eta$, so the sequence $N \mapsto 1/\iota(N)$ converges to $0$, its terms being positive and decreasing below every positive bound ([[def-real-limit]], [[def-sequence]], [[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L6] $g$ is not Riemann integrable on $[0,1]$; its lower Darboux integral is $0$ and its upper Darboux integral is $1$ ([[cex-dirichlet-is-not-riemann-integrable]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L7] Every nonempty open interval contains an irrational ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]).

[L8] The Riemann condition of [[thm-darboux-equals-riemann]] requires, for each $\varepsilon > 0$, a $\delta > 0$ such that **every** tagged partition of mesh below $\delta$ has its Riemann sum within $\varepsilon$ of the integral.

[L9] Ordered-field arithmetic: the order is total and transitive, $\iota(N) > 0$ for $N \ge 1$, and $0 \ne 1$ ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For each $N \ge 1$, $(U_N,\xi^N)$ is a tagged partition of $[0,1]$ of mesh $1/\iota(N)$, by [L1] and [L2]. [given, L1, L2]

1.2 By [L3] every tag $\xi^N_i = t_i$ is rational, so $g(\xi^N_i) = 1$; hence by [L2], [L4] and [L1], $S(g,U_N,\xi^N) = \sum_{i<N}1\cdot\Delta_i = \sum_{i<N}\Delta_i = 1$. [given, L1, L2, L3, L4]

2.1 The sequence $N \mapsto \|U_N\| = 1/\iota(N)$ converges to $0$ and the sequence $N \mapsto S(g,U_N,\xi^N)$ is constantly $1$, hence converges to $1$, by [L5]. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L5]

3.1 So the hypothesis of [A1] is met with $I := 1$; but $g$ is not Riemann integrable on $[0,1]$ by [L6]. [A1] is therefore refuted. [step 2.1, A1, L6]

4.1 Moreover, for **each** $N \ge 1$ the same partition carries a tagging whose Riemann sum is $0$: by [L7] each open interval $(t_i,t_{i+1})$ contains an irrational, and choosing one in each of the $N$ subintervals is a finite selection, giving a tagging $\zeta$ of $U_N$ with $g(\zeta_i) = 0$ for every $i < N$ and hence $S(g,U_N,\zeta) = 0$ by [L2] and [L4]. So for every real $\delta > 0$ there are tagged partitions of mesh below $\delta$ with Riemann sum $1$ and others with Riemann sum $0$, and by [L9] no single real $I$ can satisfy the condition of [L8] at $\varepsilon := 2^{-1}$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L2, L4, L5, L7, L8, L9] ∎

## Remarks

- **What survives of the naive formulation.** If $f$ **is** integrable then every sequence of tagged partitions with meshes tending to $0$ has Riemann sums tending to $\int_a^b f$, by [[thm-darboux-equals-riemann]]; the failure is only in the converse. So sequences of Riemann sums are a legitimate way to *compute* an integral once integrability is known, and no way at all to establish it.

- **The Darboux sums see the difference immediately.** For every partition $P$ of $[0,1]$ one has $L(g,P) = 0$ and $U(g,P) = 1$ ([[cex-dirichlet-is-not-riemann-integrable]]), and by [[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]] every Riemann sum over $P$ lies between them. The rational tags realise the upper end and the irrational tags the lower end; the choice of tags moves the sum across the whole gap.

- **Choosing the irrational tags costs nothing.** Step 4.1 selects one irrational in each of finitely many subintervals, which is a finite family; the same observation as in [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]] applies, and no choice principle is used.

For $i = 0$ both equal $a$. Suppose $t_j = t'_j$\nfor all $j \\le i$ and $i + 1 \\le \\min\\{n,n'\\}$. The set\n$S := \\{\\, x \\in \\operatorname{pts}(P) : x > t_i \\,\\}$ has $t_{i+1}$ as its least\nelement: $t_{i+1} \\in S$, and any $x \\in S$ is $t_j$ for some $j \\le n$ with\n$t_j > t_i$, which forces $j > i$ because $t$ is increasing on indices $\\le n$,\nhence $j \\ge i+1$ and $x = t_j \\ge t_{i+1}$. The same argument in $P'$ makes\n$t'_{i+1}$ the least element of\n$\\{\\, x \\in \\operatorname{pts}(P') : x > t'_i \\,\\}$, which is the same set $S$,\nsince the point sets agree and $t'_i = t_i$. A set has at most one least element\n([[def-max-min]]), so $t_{i+1} = t'_{i+1}$.\n\nSecond, $n = n'$. If $n < n'$ then $t'_n = t_n = b$ by the previous paragraph,\nwhile $t'_n < t'_{n'} = b$ because $t'$ is increasing on indices $\\le n'$ and\n$n < n'$; that is impossible. Exchanging the roles of $P$ and $P'$ rules out\n$n' < n$. $\\square$\n\nSo the map $P \\mapsto \\operatorname{pts}(P)$ is injective, and a partition may be\nnamed by its point set whenever one is exhibited.\n\n### Inserting a point\n\nLet $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ and let $c \\in [a,b]$. Define a\npartition $P + c$ of $[a,b]$ as follows.\n\n- If $c \\in \\operatorname{pts}(P)$, put $P + c := P$.\n- Otherwise $c \\ne a$ and $c \\ne b$, so $a < c < b$. The set\n  $T := \\{\\, t_i : i \\le n \\text{ and } t_i < c \\,\\}$ is a nonempty finite set of\n  reals, nonempty because $t_0 = a < c$, so it has a maximum\n  ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]); let $i_0 \\le n$ be the unique index with\n  $t_{i_0} = \\max T$, unique because $t$ is injective on indices $\\le n$. Then\n  $i_0 < n$, since $t_n = b > c$ puts $t_n \\notin T$; and\n  $$t_{i_0} \\;<\\; c \\;<\\; t_{i_0+1},$$\n  the right inequality because $t_{i_0+1} \\ne c$ (as $c \\notin \\operatorname{pts}(P)$)\n  and $t_{i_0+1} < c$ would put $t_{i_0+1} \\in T$ with $t_{i_0+1} > t_{i_0} = \\max T$.\n  Put $P + c := (n+1, s)$ with\n  $$s_i := t_i \\ (i \\le i_0), \\qquad s_{i_0+1} := c, \\qquad s_i := t_{i-1} \\ (i_0 + 2 \\le i \\le n+1), \\qquad s_k := b \\ (k \\ge n+1).$$\n\nIn both cases $P + c$ is a partition of $[a,b]$ and\n\n$$\\operatorname{pts}(P + c) \\;=\\; \\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\{c\\}, \\qquad \\|P+c\\| \\;\\le\\; \\|P\\| .$$\n\nThe displayed identity is immediate from the two cases. For the mesh: in the\nfirst case nothing changes; in the second the list of subinterval lengths of\n$P + c$ is that of $P$ with $\\Delta_{i_0}$ replaced by the two numbers\n$c - t_{i_0}$ and $t_{i_0+1} - c$, each of which is smaller than\n$\\Delta_{i_0} = (c - t_{i_0}) + (t_{i_0+1} - c)$ because the other is positive.\nSo every length of $P + c$ is at most a length of $P$, and the maximum cannot\nincrease. Finally the index count grows by exactly $1$ in the second case and\nnot at all in the first.\n\n### Refinement and the common refinement\n\n$P'$ **refines** $P$, and is a **refinement** of $P$, when\n\n$$\\operatorname{pts}(P) \\;\\subseteq\\; \\operatorname{pts}(P') .$$\n\nLet $P = (n,t)$ and $Q = (m,s)$ be partitions of $[a,b]$. Applying the recursion\ntheorem ([[thm-recursion]]) to the set $\\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$,\nwhere $\\mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$ is the set of partitions of $[a,b]$, with starting\nelement $(0, P)$ and the map $(j, R) \\mapsto (j+1,\\ R + s_j)$ — legitimate\nbecause $s_j \\in [a,b]$ for every $j \\in \\mathbb{N}$ — gives a unique family\n$(R_j)_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ of partitions with $R_0 = P$ and $R_{j+1} = R_j + s_j$.\nThe **common refinement** of $P$ and $Q$ is\n\n$$P \\vee Q \\;:=\\; R_{m+1} .$$\n\n**Its point set is the union.** By induction on $j$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]),\n$\\operatorname{pts}(R_j) = \\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\{\\, s_l : l < j \\,\\}$;\ntaking $j = m+1$ gives\n\n$$\\operatorname{pts}(P \\vee Q) \\;=\\; \\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\operatorname{pts}(Q).$$\n\nHence $P \\vee Q$ refines both $P$ and $Q$; by the uniqueness claim above it is\nthe **only** partition with that point set, so $P \\vee Q = Q \\vee P$, and\n\n$$P' \\text{ refines } P \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad P \\vee P' = P' ,$$\n\nsince then $\\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\operatorname{pts}(P') =\n\\operatorname{pts}(P')$.\n\n**Two size bounds, both used later.** Writing $n_R$ for the first component of a\npartition $R$:\n\n$$\\|P \\vee Q\\| \\;\\le\\; \\|P\\|, \\qquad n_{P \\vee Q} \\;\\le\\; n_P + n_Q - 1 .$$\n\nThe first is the mesh bound above applied $m+1$ times. For the second, each\ninsertion raises the index count by at most $1$, and the two insertions of\n$s_0 = a$ and $s_m = b$ raise it by $0$, since $a$ and $b$ already lie in\n$\\operatorname{pts}(P)$ and hence in $\\operatorname{pts}(R_j)$ for every $j$; so\nat most $m - 1$ of the $m+1$ insertions increase it.\n\n### The index map of a refinement\n\nLet $P' = (n',t')$ refine $P = (n,t)$. For each $i \\le n$ the point $t_i$ lies in\n$\\operatorname{pts}(P')$, so there is exactly one $\\varphi(i) \\le n'$ with\n$t'_{\\varphi(i)} = t_i$, uniqueness because $t'$ is injective on indices $\\le n'$.\nThe resulting map $\\varphi$ satisfies\n\n$$\\varphi(0) = 0, \\qquad \\varphi(n) = n', \\qquad \\varphi(i) < \\varphi(i+1) \\ \\ (i < n),$$\n\nthe first two because $t'_0 = a = t_0$ and $t'_{n'} = b = t_n$ together with\ninjectivity, and the third because $t_i < t_{i+1}$ and $t'$ is increasing on\nindices $\\le n'$. In particular $n \\le n'$. Moreover, for $i < n$ and\n$\\varphi(i) \\le j < \\varphi(i+1)$,\n\n$$I'_j \\;=\\; [\\,t'_j,\\ t'_{j+1}\\,] \\;\\subseteq\\; [\\,t_i,\\ t_{i+1}\\,] \\;=\\; I_i ,$$\n\nbecause $t_i = t'_{\\varphi(i)} \\le t'_j$ and $t'_{j+1} \\le t'_{\\varphi(i+1)} = t_{i+1}$.\n\n**The blocks are counted by telescoping.** By clause 5 of\n[[lem-finite-sum-laws]],\n$\\sum_{i<n}\\big(\\varphi(i+1) - \\varphi(i)\\big) = \\varphi(n) - \\varphi(0) = n'$,\nso, subtracting $\\sum_{i<n} 1 = n$,\n\n$$\\sum_{i<n} \\big(\\varphi(i+1) - \\varphi(i) - 1\\big) \\;=\\; n' - n ,$$\n\na sum of $n$ nonnegative integers, one for each block, which vanishes exactly at\nthe blocks consisting of a single index.

It holds because\n$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to\nboth sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside\n$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.\n\n**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \\le b$, which is\nexactly the condition making them nonempty.

## Statement refuted

**Refuted:** that every bounded function on a closed bounded interval with
distinct endpoints is Riemann integrable
([[fs-bounded-implies-riemann-integrable]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

The witness is the Dirichlet function $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ restricted to
$[0,1]$ ([[def-dirichlet-and-thomae-functions]]). It takes only the values $0$
and $1$, so it is bounded ([[def-bounded-set]]); every lower Darboux sum is $0$
and every upper Darboux sum is $1$; hence

$$\underline{\int_0^1}\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}} \;=\; 0 \;\ne\; 1 \;=\; \overline{\int_0^1}\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}} ,$$

and the function is not Riemann integrable. The two Darboux integrals are as far
apart as the range of the function allows.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $g : [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ with $g(x) = 1$ for rational $x$ and $g(x) = 0$ for irrational $x$ ([[def-dirichlet-and-thomae-functions]]).

[A1] The refuted claim: every bounded function on such an interval is Riemann integrable ([[fs-bounded-implies-riemann-integrable]]).

[L1] Both $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}$ are dense in $\mathbb{R}$, so every nonempty open interval contains a rational and an irrational ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L2] For a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[0,1]$: $n \ge 1$, $t_i < t_{i+1}$, $\Delta_i > 0$, $\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = 1$, $I_i = [t_i,t_{i+1}]$, and $(t_i,t_{i+1})$ is a nonempty open interval contained in $I_i$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-interval]]).

[L3] $m_i = \inf g[I_i]$, $M_i = \sup g[I_i]$, $L(g,P) = \sum_{i<n}m_i\Delta_i$, $U(g,P) = \sum_{i<n}M_i\Delta_i$; $\underline{\int_0^1}g$ is the supremum of the lower sums and $\overline{\int_0^1}g$ the infimum of the upper sums; $g$ is integrable exactly when they agree ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L4] A set with a least element has it as its infimum and one with a greatest element has it as its supremum; the supremum and infimum of $\{c\}$ are both $c$ ([[def-infimum]], [[def-max-min]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L5] Finite sums: scaling and $\sum_{i<n}0 = 0$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L6] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 \ne 1$, and the order is total and transitive ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $g$ is bounded, with $0 \le g(x) \le 1$ for every $x \in [0,1]$, so its Darboux sums and integrals are defined by [L3]. [given, L3]

1.2 Let $P = (n,t)$ be any partition of $[0,1]$ and $i < n$. By [L2] the interval $(t_i,t_{i+1})$ is nonempty and open, so by [L1] it contains a rational and an irrational, both lying in $I_i$. Hence $g[I_i] = \{0,1\}$ and, by [L4], $m_i = 0$ and $M_i = 1$. [given, L1, L2, L4]

2.1 Therefore $L(g,P) = \sum_{i<n}0\cdot\Delta_i = 0$ and $U(g,P) = \sum_{i<n}1\cdot\Delta_i = \sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = 1$, for every partition $P$ of $[0,1]$, by [L3], [L5] and [L2]. [step 1.2, L2, L3, L5]

3.1 The set of lower sums is $\{0\}$ and the set of upper sums is $\{1\}$, so $\underline{\int_0^1}g = 0$ and $\overline{\int_0^1}g = 1$ by [L4] and [L3]. Since $0 \ne 1$ by [L6], $g$ is not Riemann integrable on $[0,1]$. [step 2.1, L3, L4, L6]

4.1 So $g$ is bounded on $[0,1]$, an interval with $0 < 1$, and is not Riemann integrable: [A1] is refuted. [step 1.1, step 3.1, A1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The failure is uniform over partitions.** No partition does better than any other here: $U(g,P) - L(g,P) = 1$ for **every** $P$, so Riemann's criterion ([[thm-riemann-criterion]]) fails as badly as it can. Contrast the Cantor-set indicator, where the gap does go to $0$ ([[ex-indicator-of-the-cantor-set-is-integrable-with-integral-zero]]).

- **The Lebesgue criterion gives the same verdict for the same reason.** $g$ is discontinuous at every point of $[0,1]$ ([[thm-dirichlet-and-thomae-continuity-sets]]), and $[0,1]$ is not null ([[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]]), so [[thm-lebesgue-criterion]] refuses it too. The direct computation above is kept because it is elementary and costs no choice principle.

- **The Riemann sums are not even a warning.** Every uniform partition with rational tags gives Riemann sum $1$, so along that one sequence of tagged partitions the sums converge; this is precisely why the Riemann definition quantifies over all tagged partitions of small mesh ([[cex-riemann-sums-along-one-sequence-of-tagged-partitions-do-not-suffice]]).

## Statement

Let $F$ be a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and let
$\varepsilon \in F$ with $\varepsilon > 0$. Then there is a natural number
$n \ge 1$ such that

$$\frac{1}{n \cdot 1_F} < \varepsilon ,$$

where $n \cdot 1_F$ is the canonical natural of $F$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]]) and
$1/(n \cdot 1_F)$ is its multiplicative inverse ([[def-field]]). As is standard
we abbreviate $n \cdot 1_F$ to $n$ and write the conclusion $1/n < \varepsilon$.

This is the **reciprocal form** of the Archimedean property.
[[thm-of-archimedean]] on its own delivers only the assertion that the canonical
naturals are cofinal, $x < n \cdot 1_F$; the form actually used in analysis, that
the reciprocals of the naturals get below every positive bound, is the statement
above, and it is recorded separately so that no proof has to reconstruct the
inversion step in passing.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $F$ and an element $\varepsilon \in F$ with $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] Archimedean property: for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Inverses and order: if $a > 0$ then $a^{-1} > 0$, and if $0 < a < b$ then $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Field arithmetic: an element $a$ with $a > 0$ is nonzero by trichotomy, hence has a multiplicative inverse $a^{-1}$, and $(a^{-1})^{-1} = a$ ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Since $\varepsilon > 0$, trichotomy gives $\varepsilon \ne 0$, so $\varepsilon^{-1}$ exists, and $\varepsilon^{-1} > 0$. [given, L2, L3]

2.1 Apply [L1] to $x = \varepsilon^{-1}$: fix a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $\varepsilon^{-1} < n \cdot 1_F$. [step 1.1, L1, choose]

3.1 Chaining the two displayed inequalities gives $0 < \varepsilon^{-1} < n \cdot 1_F$; in particular $n \cdot 1_F > 0$, so $n \cdot 1_F \ne 0$ and $1/(n \cdot 1_F)$ is defined. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L3]

4.1 Apply the second claim of [L2] with $a = \varepsilon^{-1}$ and $b = n \cdot 1_F$: $0 < (n \cdot 1_F)^{-1} < (\varepsilon^{-1})^{-1}$. [step 3.1, L2]

5.1 By [L3], $(\varepsilon^{-1})^{-1} = \varepsilon$, so the natural number $n \ge 1$ fixed in step 2.1 satisfies $1/(n \cdot 1_F) < \varepsilon$, which is the assertion. [step 4.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Monotonicity gives the eventual form for free.** If $m \ge n \ge 1$ then
  $m \cdot 1_F \ge n \cdot 1_F > 0$, because $k \mapsto k \cdot 1_F$ is strictly
  increasing on the naturals $\ge 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]), and so
  $1/(m \cdot 1_F) \le 1/(n \cdot 1_F) < \varepsilon$ by [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]
  again. So the corollary yields not merely one index but a threshold: every
  $m \ge n$ satisfies $1/m < \varepsilon$. That one extra line is what a
  convergence proof needs, and it is left to the caller rather than folded into
  the statement, because the caller usually has a threshold of its own to combine
  it with.

- **Completeness is used only through [[thm-of-archimedean]].** Nothing here
  needs the least-upper-bound property directly. The corollary therefore holds
  verbatim in any Archimedean ordered field, in particular in $\mathbb{Q}$, and
  it fails in a non-Archimedean ordered field, where an infinitesimal
  $\varepsilon > 0$ is below every $1/n$ by construction.

- The equivalence is exact: the reciprocal form implies the cofinal form back
  again, since given $x > 0$ one applies it to $\varepsilon = 1/x$. The two are
  the same property written on the two sides of the inversion, and only the
  direction proved above is used in this library.

## Definition

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]) with additive identity $0_F$ and
multiplicative identity $1_F$. Define
$\iota : \mathbb{N} \to F$ by recursion on $\mathbb{N}$
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[thm-recursion]]):

$$\iota(0) \;:=\; 0_F, \qquad \iota(n+1) \;:=\; \iota(n) + 1_F .$$

$\iota(n)$ is the **canonical natural** of $n$ in $F$. It is also written
$n \cdot 1_F$, and for $n \ge 1$ it is $1_F$ added to itself $n$ times.

**Why the notation is needed at all.** A natural number in this library is a von
Neumann natural, that is a set ([[def-natural-numbers]]), and a set is not an
element of $F$. So $1/n$, $n^{\alpha}$ and $x/n$ are not expressions of $F$ when
$n$ is a natural: what they mean is $1/\iota(n)$, $\iota(n)^{\alpha}$ and
$x/\iota(n)$. The map $\iota$ is what carries a counting number into the field,
and writing it is the whole reason a reader meets $1/\iota(k+1)$ where an
informal text would write $1/(k+1)$.

## Remarks

- **Where the index shift comes from.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
  ([[def-natural-numbers]]) and $\iota(0) = 0_F$, so $1/\iota(k)$ is undefined at
  $k = 0$. A family of reciprocals indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ is therefore written
  over $\iota(k+1)$, which is why the harmonic and telescoping families of this
  library run over $k+1$ rather than over $k$. This is bookkeeping, not a
  restriction: the values are the usual ones.

- **This definition records notation; the arithmetic is proved elsewhere.** That
  $\iota$ is strictly increasing and positive on $n \ge 1$, and that it carries
  sums to sums and products to products, is [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], stated
  for an ordered field. That lemma introduces the same element by the equivalent
  recursion $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, which
  agrees with the definition above because $\iota(1) = \iota(0) + 1_F = 1_F$.
  Nothing here is new mathematics; the definition exists so that the notation has
  a home a reader can look up.

- **The symbol $\iota$ is used in this library for other canonical maps, and this
  definition does not govern them.** It also denotes the canonical field
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to F$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), the isometric
  embedding of a metric space into a completion ([[def-metric-completion]]), and
  an inclusion map $\iota : S \to X$ of a subspace. Each of those is introduced
  where it is used and means something different from the map defined here. What
  the four share is only that each is the canonical map of its situation.

- **Fields, not just ordered fields.** The recursion needs no order, so the
  definition is stated for a field; every use in this library is in an ordered
  field, and the order is what makes $\iota$ injective
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). In a field of positive characteristic $\iota$
  is not injective, which is one reason the injectivity is a lemma rather than
  part of the definition.

## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq F$.

- $u \in F$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$; $S$ is
  **bounded above** if it has an upper bound.
- $u \in F$ is a **least upper bound** (or **supremum**, $\sup S$) of $S$ if $u$
  is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le u'$ for every upper bound $u'$ of $S$.

$F$ is a **complete ordered field** (equivalently, $F$ has the
**least-upper-bound property**, or is **Dedekind complete**) if every nonempty
$S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$.

## Remarks

- A least upper bound, if it exists, is unique (two least upper bounds are each
  $\le$ the other, so equal by antisymmetry of the order).
- Applying the property to $\{-s : s \in S\}$ yields the dual **greatest lower
  bound** (infimum) property, so the two are equivalent.
- The Dedekind-cut reals have this property by construction
  ([[thm-dedekind-complete]]); the Cauchy-sequence reals acquire it via
  [[cor-cauchy-reals-lub-complete]]. This definition is the target for the
  uniqueness theorem [[thm-uniqueness-complete-ordered-field]].

## Definition

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]). Write $\mathcal{P}$ for the set of all partitions of
$[a,b]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]) and put

$$\mathcal{L} \;:=\; \{\, L(f,P) \ : \ P \in \mathcal{P} \,\}, \qquad \mathcal{U} \;:=\; \{\, U(f,P) \ : \ P \in \mathcal{P} \,\}$$

for the sets of lower and of upper Darboux sums ([[def-darboux-sums]]).

### Both extrema exist

**$\mathcal{P}$ is nonempty**: the pair $(1, t)$ with $t_0 := a$ and $t_k := b$
for $k \ge 1$ is a partition of $[a,b]$, since $a < b$. So $\mathcal{L}$ and
$\mathcal{U}$ are nonempty.

**$\mathcal{L}$ is bounded above and $\mathcal{U}$ is bounded below.** Fix any
$Q \in \mathcal{P}$. By claim 2 of [[lem-refinement-inequalities]],
$L(f,P) \le U(f,Q)$ for every $P \in \mathcal{P}$, so $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound
of $\mathcal{L}$; and $L(f,Q) \le U(f,P)$ for every $P$, so $L(f,Q)$ is a lower
bound of $\mathcal{U}$.

Hence a nonempty set bounded above has a supremum
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and a nonempty set bounded below has an infimum
([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]), each unique ([[lem-sup-unique]]).
The **lower** and **upper Darboux integrals** of $f$ over $[a,b]$ are the real
numbers

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;:=\; \sup \mathcal{L} \;=\; \sup_{P} L(f,P), \qquad \overline{\int_a^b} f \;:=\; \inf \mathcal{U} \;=\; \inf_{P} U(f,P) .$$

### The lower integral never exceeds the upper one

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f .$$

Indeed, for each fixed $Q \in \mathcal{P}$ the number $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound
of $\mathcal{L}$, so the least upper bound satisfies
$\underline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,Q)$. As $Q$ was arbitrary, $\underline{\int_a^b}f$
is a lower bound of $\mathcal{U}$, and the greatest lower bound satisfies
$\underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f$ ([[def-infimum]]).

Moreover, for **every** partition $P$,

$$L(f,P) \;\le\; \underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; U(f,P) ,$$

the outer inequalities because a member of a set is at most its supremum and at
least its infimum.

### Integrability

$f$ is **Darboux integrable on $[a,b]$**, and on this page simply
**integrable**, when

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;=\; \overline{\int_a^b} f ,$$

and then the common value is written

$$\int_a^b f \qquad \text{or} \qquad \int_a^b f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x ,$$

the **integral of $f$ over $[a,b]$**. It is a single well-determined real
number, being the common value of two numbers each of which is unique
([[lem-sup-unique]]). Without the displayed equality the symbol $\int_a^b f$ is
not defined and is never written.

**The inequality above is the whole difficulty.** By the previous paragraph
integrability is *never* a question of one integral exceeding the other, only of
the gap $\overline{\int_a^b} f - \underline{\int_a^b} f \ge 0$ being $0$; and by
[[thm-riemann-criterion]] that gap is $0$ exactly when a single partition can be
found making $U(f,P) - L(f,P)$ small. Whether that is possible is settled
completely, in terms of the discontinuities of $f$, by
[[thm-lebesgue-criterion]].

**"Riemann integrable" means the same thing here.** The definition above is
Darboux's. Riemann's own definition, in terms of tagged partitions of small
mesh, is [[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]], and the two define the same
class of functions with the same integral by [[thm-darboux-equals-riemann]].
Until that theorem is proved the two phrases are kept apart; after it they are
used interchangeably, as they are throughout the literature.

## Remarks

- **The supremum is over all partitions, and nothing is selected.** Both
  $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{U}$ are sets determined by $f$ and $[a,b]$ alone,
  and $\sup$ and $\inf$ are canonical, so no choice principle is involved in
  forming either integral. Where a choice does enter on this page is recorded in
  [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].

- **Why the lower integral is a supremum and not an infimum.** Refining a
  partition can only increase a lower sum and decrease an upper sum
  ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]]), so the lower sums push up towards the
  integral and the upper sums push down towards it. Taking $\inf \mathcal{L}$
  would return the sum over the coarsest partition and would carry no
  information about $f$ beyond its infimum on $[a,b]$.

- **A bounded $f$ always has both integrals; only their equality can fail.** The
  Dirichlet function on $[0,1]$ has lower integral $0$ and upper integral $1$
  ([[fs-bounded-implies-riemann-integrable]]), which is the standard witness that
  the definition above is not vacuous in either direction.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{N} \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Q} \subseteq
\mathbb{R}$ denotes the chain of canonical embeddings
([[lem-nat-embeds-int]], [[lem-int-embeds-rat]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and
each set is identified with its image in $\mathbb{R}$, as elsewhere in this
library; for a natural $q$ the real $\iota(q) = q \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ is the
canonical natural ([[def-canonical-natural]]), and $\iota(q) > 0$ for $q \ge 1$
([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). A real is **rational** when it lies in
$\mathbb{Q}$ and **irrational** otherwise; both sets are dense in $\mathbb{R}$
([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]).

### The Dirichlet function

$$\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}} : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad \mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(x) := \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } x \in \mathbb{Q},\\ 0 & \text{if } x \notin \mathbb{Q}.\end{cases}$$

This is the indicator of the rationals. It is a function because every real
either lies in $\mathbb{Q}$ or does not, and the two clauses are exclusive.

### The least denominator of a rational

Let $x \in \mathbb{Q}$ and put

$$Q(x) \;:=\; \{\, q \in \mathbb{N} \;:\; q \ge 1 \ \text{ and } \ \iota(q)\,x \in \mathbb{Z} \,\}.$$

**$Q(x)$ is nonempty.** Every rational is $a/b$ with $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $b$ a
positive integer ([[lem-int-embeds-rat]]), and a positive integer is $\iota(q)$
for a unique natural $q \ge 1$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]); then
$\iota(q)\,x = a \in \mathbb{Z}$, so $q \in Q(x)$.

By the well-ordering principle ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]) the nonempty
subset $Q(x) \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ has a least element. Write

$$q(x) \;:=\; \min Q(x) \;\ge\; 1,$$

the **least denominator** of $x$, and $p(x) := \iota(q(x))\,x \in \mathbb{Z}$,
so that

$$x \;=\; \frac{p(x)}{\iota(q(x))} .$$

Nothing is selected here: $q(x)$ is the least element of a set determined by
$x$, so it is a function of $x$ alone.

**The least denominator is the denominator in lowest terms.** The integers
$p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are coprime ([[def-coprime]]). Indeed put
$d := \gcd(p(x), q(x))$, which satisfies $d \ge 1$ because $q(x) \ge 1$ makes the
pair different from $(0,0)$ ([[lem-gcd-basic-values]],
[[def-common-divisor-and-gcd]]). Then $d$ divides $q(x)$, so $q(x)/d$ is a
natural number $\ge 1$, and $\iota(q(x)/d) = \iota(q(x))/d$ because $\iota$
carries products of naturals to products ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]); hence

$$\iota(q(x)/d)\,x \;=\; \frac{\iota(q(x))\,x}{d} \;=\; \frac{p(x)}{d} \;\in\; \mathbb{Z},$$

so $q(x)/d \in Q(x)$ and therefore $q(x)/d \ge q(x)$, which forces $d = 1$.
**Conversely, a lowest-terms denominator is the least one, so the description is
unambiguous.** Suppose $x = p/\iota(q)$ with $q \ge 1$ a natural, $p \in \mathbb{Z}$
and $\gcd(p,q) = 1$. Then $q \in Q(x)$, so $q_{0} := q(x) \le q$; and from
$p/\iota(q) = p(x)/\iota(q_{0})$ we get $q_{0}p = q\,p(x)$ in $\mathbb{Z}$, so
$q \mid q_{0}p$, and $\gcd(p,q) = 1$ gives $q \mid q_{0}$
([[lem-coprime-divides-product]], claim 1), hence $q \le q_{0}$. So $q = q(x)$:
writing $x = p/q$ "in lowest terms with $q \ge 1$" and taking $q = q(x)$ describe
the same integer, and [[cor-gcd-quotients-coprime]] is what produces such a
representation from an arbitrary one.

### Thomae's function

$$t : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad t(x) := \begin{cases} 1/\iota(q(x)) & \text{if } x \in \mathbb{Q},\\ 0 & \text{if } x \notin \mathbb{Q}.\end{cases}$$

It is also called the **popcorn function** or the **ruler function**. The value
is well defined because $q(x)$ is, and $\iota(q(x)) \ge 1 > 0$ is invertible.

**Boundary values, stated rather than left to the reader.**

- $t(0) = 1$. Indeed $\iota(1)\cdot 0 = 0 \in \mathbb{Z}$, so $1 \in Q(0)$ and
  $q(0) = 1$; the representation is $0 = 0/1$.
- $t(m) = 1$ for every integer $m$, by the same computation with $1 \in Q(m)$.
- $0 < t(x) \le 1$ for every rational $x$, since $\iota(q(x)) \ge 1$; and
  $t(x) = 0$ exactly at the irrationals.

**On the range.** The values of $t$ are $0$ and the reciprocals
$1/\iota(q)$ of the canonical naturals $q \ge 1$; every such value is attained,
$1/\iota(q)$ being the value at the rational $1/\iota(q)$ itself, whose least
denominator is $q$ because $\iota(k)/\iota(q) \in \mathbb{Z}$ with
$1 \le k < q$ would give a positive integer smaller than $1$.

## Definition

Throughout this page $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), in particular an ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]]) and a field ([[def-field]]), and $\mathbb{N}$ is the set
of natural numbers ([[def-natural-numbers]]) with successor $\sigma(n) = n + 1$
([[def-nat-addition]]).

Let $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a sequence of reals, written $a_k$ for
$a(k)$. **Finite sums and finite products of $a$ are defined by recursion on the
upper index**, which is legitimate because of the recursion theorem
([[thm-recursion]]). That theorem produces a function of one variable, so the
running index has to be carried along inside the value: applying it to the set
$A = \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$, the starting element $(0, 0)$ and the function
$f(n, s) = (\sigma(n),\, s + a_n)$ gives a unique
$g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$ with

$$g(0) = (0, 0), \qquad g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n)) \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Write $g(n) = \big(\pi_1(g(n)),\, \Sigma_n\big)$ for its two coordinates.

**The first coordinate is the index itself, and that is a small induction, not an
observation** ([[thm-induction-principle]]). Indeed $\pi_1(g(0)) = 0$; and if
$\pi_1(g(n)) = n$, then
$g(\sigma(n)) = f\big(\pi_1(g(n)), \Sigma_n\big) = \big(\sigma(\pi_1(g(n))),\, \Sigma_n + a_{\pi_1(g(n))}\big) = \big(\sigma(n),\, \Sigma_n + a_n\big)$,
so $\pi_1(g(\sigma(n))) = \sigma(n)$. By induction $\pi_1(g(n)) = n$ for every
$n \in \mathbb{N}$. Only now may the second coordinate of the two displayed
clauses be read off, and doing so gives

$$\Sigma_0 = 0, \qquad \Sigma_{\sigma(n)} = \Sigma_n + a_n .$$

$\Sigma$ is moreover the **unique** function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with those
two properties: if $\Sigma'$ also has them then $n \mapsto (n, \Sigma'_n)$ satisfies
the two clauses defining $g$, hence equals $g$ by the uniqueness clause of
[[thm-recursion]], so $\Sigma' = \Sigma$.

We write $\sum_{k < n} a_k := \Sigma_n$. The same construction with starting
element $(0, 1)$ and $f(n, p) = (\sigma(n),\, p \cdot a_n)$, with the same
induction on the first coordinate and the same uniqueness argument, gives the
unique $\Pi : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with

$$\Pi_0 = 1, \qquad \Pi_{\sigma(n)} = \Pi_n \cdot a_n ,$$

and we write $\prod_{k < n} a_k := \Pi_n$.

**Notation.** For $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ we abbreviate

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \sum_{k < n+1} a_k, \qquad \prod_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \prod_{k < n+1} a_k,$$

and, for a general lower index $m$ with $m \le n + 1$, writing $d = n + 1 - m$
for the number of terms,

$$\sum_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \sum_{j < d} a_{m+j}, \qquad \prod_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \prod_{j < d} a_{m+j} .$$

When $m = n + 1$ we have $d = 0$ and the sum is **empty**, with value $0$, while
the empty product has value $1$. In the same spirit $\sum_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ is
notation for the empty sum $\Sigma_0 = 0$ and $\prod_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ for the
empty product $\Pi_0 = 1$; the index $-1$ never occurs as an element of
$\mathbb{N}$ and is only a way of writing "no terms".

Only finitely many values of $a$ enter $\sum_{k<n} a_k$, so the notation
$\sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\prod_{k<n} a_k$ is also used for a list
$a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$ of reals given without reference to any extension of the
list to all of $\mathbb{N}$: extend the list by $a_k = 0$ (respectively
$a_k = 1$) for $k \ge n$ and apply the definition above.

## Remarks

- **Why recursion and not "$a_0 + a_1 + \cdots + a_{n-1}$".** The dots are not a
  definition: they presuppose that the displayed pattern determines a value for
  every $n$, which is exactly what the recursion theorem
  ([[thm-recursion]]) supplies, and its uniqueness clause is what makes
  $\sum_{k<n} a_k$ a single well-determined real rather than a family of choices.
  Associativity and commutativity of addition are *not* used in the definition;
  they are used in the laws proved from it ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).
- **Naturals and rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$ (a convention used on the whole
  page).** A natural number $n$ and a rational number $r$ are not literally
  elements of $\mathbb{R}$: they enter $\mathbb{R}$ through the canonical
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$, which is an injective,
  order-preserving field homomorphism ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), restricting on
  positive naturals to $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} = 1_\mathbb{R} + \cdots + 1_\mathbb{R}$
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). Following ordinary practice, and only where no
  confusion is possible, we write $n$ for $\iota(n)$ and $r$ for $\iota(r)$; so,
  for instance, $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k<n} a_k$ means
  $\iota(n)^{-1} \cdot \sum_{k<n} a_k$, which makes sense because
  $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$. Exponents are the one place where the
  identification is deliberately NOT made: in $a^n$ and $a^r$ the exponent stays
  a natural, an integer or a rational ([[def-integer-power]],
  [[def-rational-power]]), never a real.
- The two indexings are related by $\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k = \sum_{k < n+1} a_k$, so
  a statement proved for one is available for the other. Sums over $k < n$ are
  the primitive form here because $\Sigma_0$, the empty sum, is then the base
  case of every induction, and no index outside $\mathbb{N}$ is ever needed.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ ([[def-field]]) together with a subset
$P \subseteq F$, the set of **positive** elements (the *positive cone*),
satisfying:

- **(O1) Trichotomy.** For each $x \in F$, exactly one of the following holds:
  $x \in P$, or $x = 0$, or $-x \in P$.
- **(O2) Closure.** If $x, y \in P$ then $x + y \in P$ and $x \cdot y \in P$.

We write $x > 0$ for $x \in P$ (read "$x$ is positive"), and define the order by

$$a < b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; b - a \in P, \qquad a \le b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; a < b \text{ or } a = b.$$

Thus $a > b$ means $b < a$, and $a \ge b$ means $b \le a$. An element $x$ with
$-x \in P$ (equivalently $x < 0$) is called **negative**.

## Remarks

- By trichotomy applied to $b - a$, for any $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$,
  $a = b$, $a > b$ holds; this makes $\le$ a total order.
- (O2) says the positives are closed under addition and multiplication: sums and
  products of positives are positive.
- The rationals ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and both constructions of the reals
  ([[thm-reals-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-dedekind-ordered-field]]) are ordered
  fields, so every fact proved here from (O1)-(O2) holds in each of them.

## Definition

**Standing hypothesis for this page.** Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete
ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]),
$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers and **contains $0$**
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[def-nat-order]]), $\iota : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$
is the canonical natural ([[def-canonical-natural]]), and $a, b$ are reals with

$$a \;<\; b .$$

Intervals and their lengths are those of [[def-interval]]; finite sums are those
of [[def-finite-sum]], indexed as $\sum_{i<n}$ over $i \in \mathbb{N}$.

### Partitions

A **partition of $[a,b]$** is a pair $P = (n, t)$ consisting of a natural number
$n \ge 1$ and a sequence $t : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-sequence]]) with

$$t_0 = a, \qquad t_i < t_{i+1} \ \text{ for every } i < n, \qquad t_k = b \ \text{ for every } k \ge n .$$

The tail convention on the third clause is bookkeeping only: it makes $t$ a
genuine sequence, so that the finite-sum laws of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] apply to
it verbatim, and it costs nothing because no index above $n$ is ever read. The
first two clauses say exactly that

$$a \;=\; t_0 \;<\; t_1 \;<\; \dots \;<\; t_n \;=\; b ,$$

the last equality because $t_n = b$ by the third clause. In particular
$i \mapsto t_i$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on
$\{\, i \in \mathbb{N} : i \le n \,\}$ ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]),
and $a \le t_i \le b$ for every $i \le n$.

The **point set** of $P$ is the finite set

$$\operatorname{pts}(P) \;:=\; \{\, t_i \ : \ i \le n \,\} \;\subseteq\; [a,b], \qquad a, b \in \operatorname{pts}(P) .$$

The **subintervals** of $P$ are

$$I_i \;:=\; [\,t_i,\ t_{i+1}\,] \qquad (i < n),$$

and their **lengths** are $\Delta_i := t_{i+1} - t_i$. Each $\Delta_i > 0$, so
each $I_i$ is a nondegenerate closed bounded interval ([[def-interval]]). There
are $n$ of them and they are indexed from $i = 0$, not from $i = 1$: the first
subinterval is $[t_0, t_1] = [a, t_1]$.

**The lengths sum to $b - a$.** By the telescoping law, clause 5 of
[[lem-finite-sum-laws]],

$$\sum_{i<n} \Delta_i \;=\; \sum_{i<n} (t_{i+1} - t_i) \;=\; t_n - t_0 \;=\; b - a .$$

**The mesh.** The set $\{\, \Delta_i : i < n \,\}$ is a nonempty finite set of
reals, nonempty because $n \ge 1$, so it has a maximum
([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]). The **mesh** of $P$ is

$$\|P\| \;:=\; \max\{\, \Delta_i \ : \ i < n \,\} \;>\; 0 ,$$

and $\Delta_i \le \|P\|$ for every $i < n$.

**The uniform partition.** For a natural $N \ge 1$, the **uniform partition of
$[a,b]$ into $N$ parts** is $U_N := (N, t)$ with

$$t_i \;:=\; a + \iota(i)\,\frac{b-a}{\iota(N)} \quad (i \le N), \qquad t_k := b \quad (k \ge N).$$

This is a partition: $t_0 = a$; $t_N = a + (b-a) = b$; and $t_{i+1} - t_i =
(b-a)/\iota(N) > 0$ for $i < N$, because $\iota(N) > 0$ and $\iota(i+1) =
\iota(i) + 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[def-canonical-natural]]). Its
subinterval lengths are all equal to $(b-a)/\iota(N)$, so

$$\|U_N\| \;=\; \frac{b-a}{\iota(N)} .$$

### A partition is determined by its point set

**Claim.** If $P = (n,t)$ and $P' = (n', t')$ are partitions of $[a,b]$ with
$\operatorname{pts}(P) = \operatorname{pts}(P')$, then $n = n'$ and $t_i = t'_i$
for every $i \le n$.

*Proof.* First, $t_i = t'_i$ for every $i \le \min\{n,n'\}$, by induction on $i$
([[thm-induction-principle]]). For $i = 0$ both equal $a$. Suppose $t_j = t'_j$
for all $j \le i$ and $i + 1 \le \min\{n,n'\}$. The set
$S := \{\, x \in \operatorname{pts}(P) : x > t_i \,\}$ has $t_{i+1}$ as its least
element: $t_{i+1} \in S$, and any $x \in S$ is $t_j$ for some $j \le n$ with
$t_j > t_i$, which forces $j > i$ because $t$ is increasing on indices $\le n$,
hence $j \ge i+1$ and $x = t_j \ge t_{i+1}$. The same argument in $P'$ makes
$t'_{i+1}$ the least element of
$\{\, x \in \operatorname{pts}(P') : x > t'_i \,\}$, which is the same set $S$,
since the point sets agree and $t'_i = t_i$. A set has at most one least element
([[def-max-min]]), so $t_{i+1} = t'_{i+1}$.

Second, $n = n'$. If $n < n'$ then $t'_n = t_n = b$ by the previous paragraph,
while $t'_n < t'_{n'} = b$ because $t'$ is increasing on indices $\le n'$ and
$n < n'$; that is impossible. Exchanging the roles of $P$ and $P'$ rules out
$n' < n$. $\square$

So the map $P \mapsto \operatorname{pts}(P)$ is injective, and a partition may be
named by its point set whenever one is exhibited.

### Inserting a point

Let $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ and let $c \in [a,b]$. Define a
partition $P + c$ of $[a,b]$ as follows.

- If $c \in \operatorname{pts}(P)$, put $P + c := P$.
- Otherwise $c \ne a$ and $c \ne b$, so $a < c < b$. The set
  $T := \{\, t_i : i \le n \text{ and } t_i < c \,\}$ is a nonempty finite set of
  reals, nonempty because $t_0 = a < c$, so it has a maximum
  ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]); let $i_0 \le n$ be the unique index with
  $t_{i_0} = \max T$, unique because $t$ is injective on indices $\le n$. Then
  $i_0 < n$, since $t_n = b > c$ puts $t_n \notin T$; and
  $$t_{i_0} \;<\; c \;<\; t_{i_0+1},$$
  the right inequality because $t_{i_0+1} \ne c$ (as $c \notin \operatorname{pts}(P)$)
  and $t_{i_0+1} < c$ would put $t_{i_0+1} \in T$ with $t_{i_0+1} > t_{i_0} = \max T$.
  Put $P + c := (n+1, s)$ with
  $$s_i := t_i \ (i \le i_0), \qquad s_{i_0+1} := c, \qquad s_i := t_{i-1} \ (i_0 + 2 \le i \le n+1), \qquad s_k := b \ (k \ge n+1).$$

In both cases $P + c$ is a partition of $[a,b]$ and

$$\operatorname{pts}(P + c) \;=\; \operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \{c\}, \qquad \|P+c\| \;\le\; \|P\| .$$

The displayed identity is immediate from the two cases. For the mesh: in the
first case nothing changes; in the second the list of subinterval lengths of
$P + c$ is that of $P$ with $\Delta_{i_0}$ replaced by the two numbers
$c - t_{i_0}$ and $t_{i_0+1} - c$, each of which is smaller than
$\Delta_{i_0} = (c - t_{i_0}) + (t_{i_0+1} - c)$ because the other is positive.
So every length of $P + c$ is at most a length of $P$, and the maximum cannot
increase. Finally the index count grows by exactly $1$ in the second case and
not at all in the first.

### Refinement and the common refinement

$P'$ **refines** $P$, and is a **refinement** of $P$, when

$$\operatorname{pts}(P) \;\subseteq\; \operatorname{pts}(P') .$$

Let $P = (n,t)$ and $Q = (m,s)$ be partitions of $[a,b]$. Applying the recursion
theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) to the set $\mathbb{N} \times \mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$,
where $\mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$ is the set of partitions of $[a,b]$, with starting
element $(0, P)$ and the map $(j, R) \mapsto (j+1,\ R + s_j)$ — legitimate
because $s_j \in [a,b]$ for every $j \in \mathbb{N}$ — gives a unique family
$(R_j)_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ of partitions with $R_0 = P$ and $R_{j+1} = R_j + s_j$.
The **common refinement** of $P$ and $Q$ is

$$P \vee Q \;:=\; R_{m+1} .$$

**Its point set is the union.** By induction on $j$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]),
$\operatorname{pts}(R_j) = \operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \{\, s_l : l < j \,\}$;
taking $j = m+1$ gives

$$\operatorname{pts}(P \vee Q) \;=\; \operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \operatorname{pts}(Q).$$

Hence $P \vee Q$ refines both $P$ and $Q$; by the uniqueness claim above it is
the **only** partition with that point set, so $P \vee Q = Q \vee P$, and

$$P' \text{ refines } P \quad \Longrightarrow \quad P \vee P' = P' ,$$

since then $\operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \operatorname{pts}(P') =
\operatorname{pts}(P')$.

**Two size bounds, both used later.** Writing $n_R$ for the first component of a
partition $R$:

$$\|P \vee Q\| \;\le\; \|P\|, \qquad n_{P \vee Q} \;\le\; n_P + n_Q - 1 .$$

The first is the mesh bound above applied $m+1$ times. For the second, each
insertion raises the index count by at most $1$, and the two insertions of
$s_0 = a$ and $s_m = b$ raise it by $0$, since $a$ and $b$ already lie in
$\operatorname{pts}(P)$ and hence in $\operatorname{pts}(R_j)$ for every $j$; so
at most $m - 1$ of the $m+1$ insertions increase it.

### The index map of a refinement

Let $P' = (n',t')$ refine $P = (n,t)$. For each $i \le n$ the point $t_i$ lies in
$\operatorname{pts}(P')$, so there is exactly one $\varphi(i) \le n'$ with
$t'_{\varphi(i)} = t_i$, uniqueness because $t'$ is injective on indices $\le n'$.
The resulting map $\varphi$ satisfies

$$\varphi(0) = 0, \qquad \varphi(n) = n', \qquad \varphi(i) < \varphi(i+1) \ \ (i < n),$$

the first two because $t'_0 = a = t_0$ and $t'_{n'} = b = t_n$ together with
injectivity, and the third because $t_i < t_{i+1}$ and $t'$ is increasing on
indices $\le n'$. In particular $n \le n'$. Moreover, for $i < n$ and
$\varphi(i) \le j < \varphi(i+1)$,

$$I'_j \;=\; [\,t'_j,\ t'_{j+1}\,] \;\subseteq\; [\,t_i,\ t_{i+1}\,] \;=\; I_i ,$$

because $t_i = t'_{\varphi(i)} \le t'_j$ and $t'_{j+1} \le t'_{\varphi(i+1)} = t_{i+1}$.

**The blocks are counted by telescoping.** By clause 5 of
[[lem-finite-sum-laws]],
$\sum_{i<n}\big(\varphi(i+1) - \varphi(i)\big) = \varphi(n) - \varphi(0) = n'$,
so, subtracting $\sum_{i<n} 1 = n$,

$$\sum_{i<n} \big(\varphi(i+1) - \varphi(i) - 1\big) \;=\; n' - n ,$$

a sum of $n$ nonnegative integers, one for each block, which vanishes exactly at
the blocks consisting of a single index. This identity is the whole content of
the quantitative bound in [[lem-refinement-inequalities]], and it is also why
$n \le n'$.

Finally, the lengths inside a block sum to the length of the block:

$$\sum_{j = \varphi(i)}^{\varphi(i+1)-1} \Delta'_j \;=\; t'_{\varphi(i+1)} - t'_{\varphi(i)} \;=\; t_{i+1} - t_i \;=\; \Delta_i \qquad (i < n),$$

again by telescoping, applied to the sequence $l \mapsto t'_{\varphi(i)+l}$ and
read through the index-shift convention of [[def-finite-sum]].

## Remarks

- **Why $a < b$ is a standing hypothesis and not a case.** With $a = b$ the
  displayed chain $a = t_0 < \dots < t_n = b$ is unsatisfiable for $n \ge 1$, and
  admitting $n = 0$ would give a partition with no subintervals, an empty mesh
  set and no maximum. Every statement on this page is about a nondegenerate
  closed bounded interval, and the convention $\int_a^a f := 0$ is not adopted
  here because nothing below needs it.

- **The subintervals overlap at their shared endpoints, and that is harmless.**
  $I_i \cap I_{i+1} = \{t_{i+1}\}$, so the union $\bigcup_{i<n} I_i = [a,b]$ is
  not disjoint. Every quantity attached to a partition below is a sum over $i<n$
  of a number times $\Delta_i$, and a single point contributes length $0$, so no
  statement on this page is sensitive to the double counting of the $n-1$
  interior points.

- **Refinement is a relation between point sets, not between lists.** Defining it
  as "$P'$ is obtained from $P$ by inserting points" would be the same relation,
  by the uniqueness claim above, but it would make every proof carry an
  insertion order. The index map $\varphi$ recovers the list-level picture when
  it is wanted, and it is what [[lem-refinement-inequalities]] actually uses.

## Definition

A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals **converges** to $x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for
every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with
$|x_k - x| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$. It is **Cauchy** when for
every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with
$|x_k - x_l| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$.

## Remarks

- Quantifying over rational $\varepsilon$ loses nothing: below any real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ lies a positive rational ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).
- $|\cdot|$ is the absolute value of [[def-real-order]].

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]],
[[def-real-numbers]]) with its order and absolute value ([[def-real-order]]), and
$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers with its order ([[def-natural-numbers]],
[[def-nat-order]]).

A **sequence of reals** is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$. We write
$x_k$ for the value $x(k)$, call it the **$k$-th term**, and write $(x_k)$, or
$(x_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$, for the function itself. The **range** of $(x_k)$ is
the subset $\{\, x_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals and let $P$ be a property of indices.

- $(x_k)$ is **bounded** if there is $M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for
  every $k \in \mathbb{N}$; it is **unbounded** otherwise.
- $P$ holds **eventually** if there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $P(k)$ holds
  for every $k \ge K$.
- $P$ holds **frequently** if for every $K \in \mathbb{N}$ there is some
  $k \ge K$ for which $P(k)$ holds.
- For $K \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$K$-th tail** of $(x_k)$ is the sequence
  $x^{(K)}$ defined by $x^{(K)}_j := x_{j + K}$ for $j \in \mathbb{N}$; it is
  again a sequence of reals.
- A function $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is **strictly increasing** if
  $n_j < n_k$ whenever $j < k$. For such an $n$, the **subsequence** of $(x_k)$
  along $n$ is the composite $x \circ n$, written $(x_{n_k})_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$;
  it is again a sequence of reals.

**Convergence and Cauchyness are not defined here.** They are already fixed, for
sequences of reals, by the published [[def-real-limit]]: $(x_k)$ *converges* to
$x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is
$K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$, and $(x_k)$
is *Cauchy* when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$
with $|x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$. This page builds the
toolkit for those two notions and does not restate them. A sequence
**converges** if it converges to some real, and **diverges** if it does not.

## Remarks

- **Identification of $\mathbb{Q}$ with its image.** The map $q \mapsto \hat q$
  is an embedding of ordered fields ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and as is
  standard we write $q$ for $\hat q$, so that a rational may be compared with a
  real without further comment. [[def-real-limit]] is stated with the hat; every
  rational $\varepsilon$ occurring on this page is its image under this
  embedding.

- **Rational and real $\varepsilon$ agree.** [[def-real-limit]] tests convergence
  against every *rational* $\varepsilon > 0$, and its own remark records that
  this loses nothing. Spelled out: suppose that for every rational
  $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all
  $k \ge K$, and let $\eta > 0$ be an arbitrary *real*. Since $0 < \eta$,
  density of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) supplies a
  rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, and the index $K$
  belonging to that $\varepsilon$ satisfies $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon < \eta$ for
  all $k \ge K$. The converse implication is immediate, since every positive
  rational is a positive real. So the two formulations define the same relation,
  and the same two lines apply verbatim to the Cauchy condition and to any
  condition of the shape "for every $\varepsilon > 0$, eventually
  $\cdots < \varepsilon$". Proofs on this page therefore run the test with a real
  $\varepsilon$ wherever that is more convenient, and say so by citing this
  remark; nothing is smuggled in.

- **Constant sequences converge.** For $c \in \mathbb{R}$ the constant sequence
  $x_k := c$ converges to $c$, because $|x_k - c| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ for
  every $\varepsilon > 0$ and every $k$; it is bounded by $|c|$.

- **Eventually and frequently are dual.** $P$ holds frequently exactly when
  $\lnot P$ does not hold eventually, and $P$ holds eventually exactly when
  $\lnot P$ does not hold frequently. So the two quantifier patterns are
  negations of one another applied to the complementary property, and there is no
  third pattern hiding between them.

- **A sequence is not its range.** $(x_k)$ is a function, not a set, and the
  range does not determine the function: the sequence $x_0 = 0$, $x_k = 1$ for
  $k \ge 1$ and the sequence $y_0 = y_1 = 0$, $y_k = 1$ for $k \ge 2$ have the
  same range $\{0, 1\}$, yet they differ at $k = 1$, so they are different
  sequences. Order and repetition are part of the data and the range forgets
  both. Boundedness, on the other hand, depends only on the range.

- **Indexing.** Sequences here start at $k = 0$ because $\mathbb{N}$ contains
  $0$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]). Texts that index from $1$ describe the same
  objects up to a shift, and the shift changes nothing about convergence, by
  [[lem-limit-of-tail]].

## Definition

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$, with
subintervals $I_i = [t_i,t_{i+1}]$ and lengths $\Delta_i = t_{i+1} - t_i$ for
$i < n$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

A **tagging** of $P$ is a sequence $\xi : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$
([[def-sequence]]) with

$$\xi_i \;\in\; I_i \qquad \text{for every } i < n, \qquad \xi_k := b \ \text{ for } k \ge n ,$$

the second clause being the same bookkeeping tail convention that
[[def-partition-and-refinement]] uses, so that $\xi$ is a genuine sequence and no
index above $n$ is ever read. The pair $(P,\xi)$ is a **tagged partition** of
$[a,b]$, and $\xi_i$ is the **tag** of the $i$-th subinterval. The **mesh** of a
tagged partition is the mesh $\|P\|$ of its underlying partition.

**Taggings exist, and no choice is involved in producing one.** Setting
$\xi_i := t_i$ for $i < n$ and $\xi_k := b$ for $k \ge n$ defines a tagging,
since $t_i \in [t_i,t_{i+1}] = I_i$ ([[def-interval]]). So every partition
carries at least one tagging, exhibited by a formula. What *is* a selection is
choosing a tag in each subinterval subject to a condition, as
[[thm-darboux-equals-riemann]] does; there the family of choices is finite and
the selection is a theorem of ZF.

For $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ and a tagged partition $(P,\xi)$ the **Riemann
sum** of $f$ is

$$S(f,P,\xi) \;:=\; \sum_{i<n} f(\xi_i)\,\Delta_i ,$$

the finite sum of [[def-finite-sum]], indexed by $i \in \mathbb{N}$ with $i < n$.
It is a real number, being a finite sum of reals, and it is defined for **every**
$f$, bounded or not: no supremum or infimum of $f$ occurs in it.

### A Riemann sum lies between the Darboux sums of the same partition

Suppose in addition that $f$ is bounded ([[def-bounded-set]]), so that the
Darboux sums of [[def-darboux-sums]] are defined. Then for every tagging $\xi$
of $P$,

$$L(f,P) \;\le\; S(f,P,\xi) \;\le\; U(f,P) .$$

Indeed $\xi_i \in I_i$ gives $m_i \le f(\xi_i) \le M_i$ ([[def-darboux-sums]]),
and multiplying by $\Delta_i > 0$ and summing over $i < n$ preserves the two
inequalities, by monotonicity of finite sums, clause 4 of
[[lem-finite-sum-laws]], and the order axioms ([[def-ordered-field]],
[[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

This one line is the whole of the easy half of
[[thm-darboux-equals-riemann]]: whatever the tags, a Riemann sum is trapped
between the two Darboux sums, so control of $U(f,P) - L(f,P)$ is control of
every Riemann sum over $P$ at once.

## Remarks

- **The tags are unconstrained beyond membership.** In particular a tag may be an
  endpoint, two adjacent subintervals may share their tag at the common endpoint,
  and the tags need not be increasing. The three standard specialisations — left
  endpoints $\xi_i = t_i$, right endpoints $\xi_i = t_{i+1}$, midpoints
  $\xi_i = (t_i + t_{i+1})\cdot 2^{-1}$ — are all taggings, and each is given by a
  formula in $P$.

- **Convergence of Riemann sums is a mesh condition, not a sequence condition.**
  [[thm-darboux-equals-riemann]] quantifies over **all** tagged partitions of
  mesh below $\delta$. Weakening that to a single sequence of tagged partitions
  whose meshes tend to $0$ gives a strictly weaker condition, and the weakening
  is not harmless: the companion page of this pair
  exhibits a non-integrable function whose Riemann sums are constant along such a
  sequence.

- **Why Riemann sums and Darboux sums are both kept.** The Darboux sums are
  canonical functions of $f$ and $P$ and make suprema and infima available
  ([[def-darboux-integral]]); the Riemann sums are defined without any
  completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ and are what a numerical approximation actually
  computes. The theorem that the two routes give the same integral is
  [[thm-darboux-equals-riemann]].

## Statement

Let $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be sequences of reals, let
$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, and let $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, with finite sums and
finite products as in [[def-finite-sum]]. Then:

1. **Additivity.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k$.
2. **Scaling.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k$; in particular $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda = n\lambda$, where $n$ denotes the canonical natural $\iota(n) \in \mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).
3. **Splitting.** If $m \le n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k$, and $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n} a_k = \Big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k\Big)$.
4. **Monotonicity.** If $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$. In particular, if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, every single term satisfies $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$ for $j < n$, and $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ forces $a_k = 0$ for every $k < n$.
5. **Telescoping.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}\big(c_{k+1} - c_k\big) = c_n - c_0$.
6. **Products.** $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k) = \Big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\Big)$; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, and if $a_k > 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k > 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\lambda$, and naturals $m, n$. Write $\Sigma_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\Pi_n = \prod_{k<n} a_k$.

[L1] Recursion clauses ([[def-finite-sum]]): $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ and $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n$; $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1$ and $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) \cdot a_n$; and $\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k = \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j}$ for $m \le n$, likewise for products.

[L2] Field axioms: addition and multiplication are associative and commutative, $0$ and $1$ are the identities, $x - x = 0$, and multiplication distributes over addition ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]); and $0 \cdot x = 0$, which is not an axiom but a lemma ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

[L3] Induction principle: a property holding at $0$ and inherited by successors holds at every natural ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L4] Adding inequalities: $x \le y$ and $u \le v$ imply $x + u \le y + v$. [[lem-of-add-order]] states the STRICT forms and only those ($x < y \Rightarrow x + c < y + c$, and $x < y$ with $u < v$ giving $x + u < y + v$); the nonstrict form used throughout below is those two together with the cases $x = y$ and $u = v$, which are settled by trichotomy, the order being total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] The canonical embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a field homomorphism, so $\iota(0) = 0$ and $\iota(n+1) = \iota(n) + 1$, and $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L6] Sign rules: a product of two positives is positive ([[lem-of-sign-rules]], claim 1), and a product of two nonnegatives is nonnegative, since a factor equal to $0$ makes the product $0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]) and otherwise both factors are positive; and $1 > 0$, which is proved in [[cor-of-one-positive]] and stated by none of the items named above.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 0$: every claim holds at $n = 0$, since both sides of claim 1 are $0 = 0 + 0$, both sides of claim 2 are $0 = \lambda \cdot 0$ and $0 = \iota(0)\lambda$, claim 4 reads $0 \le 0$ with no term to bound and the hypothesis $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ giving nothing to prove, claim 5 reads $0 = c_0 - c_0$, and claim 6 reads $1 = 1 \cdot 1$ with $1 > 0$. [base, L1, L2, L5, L6]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for this $n$ and for all sequences $a, b, c$ and all $\lambda$. [ih]

1.3 Splitting, claim 3, by a separate induction on the number of trailing terms $d = n - m$ with $m$ fixed: for $d = 0$ the claim reads $\sum_{k<m} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + 0$ and $\prod_{k<m} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\big) \cdot 1$, which hold; and if $\sum_{k<m+d} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d} a_{m+j}$, then $\sum_{k<m+d+1} a_k = \sum_{k<m+d} a_k + a_{m+d} = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \big(\sum_{j<d} a_{m+j} + a_{m+d}\big) = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d+1} a_{m+j}$ by associativity, and identically for products with $1$ in place of $0$ and multiplication in place of addition, so induction on $d$ gives claim 3 for every $m \le n$. [L1, L2, L3]

2.1 Additivity at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k\big) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) + \big(\sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n\big) = \sum_{k<n+1} a_k + \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$, using the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of addition. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Scaling at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda a_k = \sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda\big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) = \lambda \sum_{k<n+1} a_k$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and distributivity; taking $a_k = 1$ for all $k$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda = \sum_{k<n} \lambda + \lambda = \iota(n)\lambda + \lambda = (\iota(n) + 1)\lambda = \iota(n+1)\lambda$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L5]

2.3 Monotonicity at $n+1$: assume $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n+1$; then $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$, so the hypothesis gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$, and adding the inequality $a_n \le b_n$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n \le \sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n = \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$. [step 1.2, L1, L4]

2.4 Telescoping at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(c_{k+1} - c_k) = \sum_{k<n}(c_{k+1} - c_k) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = (c_n - c_0) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = c_{n+1} - c_0$, by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and the field identities. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.5 Products at $n+1$: $\prod_{k<n+1}(a_k b_k) = \big(\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k)\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n+1} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n+1} b_k\big)$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of multiplication; and if every $a_k \ge 0$ for $k < n+1$ then $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) a_n$ is a product of two nonnegatives, hence nonnegative, with the same argument giving positivity from positivity since $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1 > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L6]

3.1 Consequences of monotonicity, completing claim 4: monotonicity itself holds at every $n$, by the induction principle applied to the base case of step 1.1 and the successor step 2.3, so it is available for an arbitrary $n$ in what follows; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then comparing with the zero sequence gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge \sum_{k<n} 0 = 0$; for $j < n$ splitting at $j$ and then at $j+1$ writes $\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<j} a_k + a_j + \sum_{k=j+1}^{n-1} a_k$ with the first and third summands $\ge 0$, so $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$; and if moreover $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ then $0 \le a_j \le 0$ for every $j < n$, so $a_j = 0$. [step 1.1, step 2.3, step 1.3, L3, L4, L2]

4.1 By the induction principle claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and claim 3 was proved in step 1.3 with its consequences in step 3.1, so all six laws hold. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, step 2.5, step 1.3, step 3.1, L3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$, with
$|x|$ the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]). Then

$$|x| \ge 0; \quad |x| = 0 \iff x = 0; \quad -|x| \le x \le |x|; \quad |-x| = |x|; \quad |xy| = |x|\,|y|;$$

and, for every $c > 0$, one has $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and elements $x, y \in F$.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| = u$ if $u \ge 0$, and $|u| = -u$ if $u < 0$ ([[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Ordered-field order: trichotomy holds (for each $u$ exactly one of $u > 0$, $u = 0$, $u < 0$), $a < b$ means $b - a$ is positive, and sums and products of positives are positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Signs in products: $(-a)b = -(ab)$ and $(-a)(-b) = ab$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] Sign rules: a product of two elements of the same sign is positive, and a product of two elements of opposite sign is negative ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Case $x > 0$: by [L1] $|x| = x > 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; since $-x < 0$ we get $|-x| = -(-x) = x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -x < 0 < x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case pos, L1, L2, algebra]

1.2 Case $x = 0$: then $|x| = |0| = 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ holds with $|x| = 0$ and $x = 0$, while $|-x| = |0| = |x|$ and $-|x| = 0 \le 0 \le 0 = |x|$. [assume-case zero, L1]

1.3 Case $x < 0$: by [L1] $|x| = -x$, and [L2] gives $-x > 0$, so $|x| > 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; here $|-x| = -x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -(-x) = x \le x$ while $x < 0 < -x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case neg, L1, L2, algebra]

1.4 Case $x = 0$ or $y = 0$: then $xy = 0$, so $|xy| = 0$, and one of $|x|, |y|$ is $0$, whence $|x|\,|y| = 0 = |xy|$. [assume-case zerofactor, L1]

1.5 Case $x, y$ have the same sign (both positive or both negative): by [L4] $xy > 0$, so $|xy| = xy$, while $|x|\,|y| = xy$ by [L3] (for $x, y < 0$ this is $(-x)(-y) = xy$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case same, L1, L3, L4]

1.6 Case $x, y$ have opposite signs (one positive, one negative): by [L4] $xy < 0$, so $|xy| = -(xy)$, while $|x|\,|y| = -(xy)$ by [L3] (namely $x(-y)$ or $(-x)y$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case opposite, L1, L3, L4]

2.1 By trichotomy [L2] each $x$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.1-1.3, and in each we verified $|x| \ge 0$, that $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$, that $|-x| = |x|$, and that $-|x| \le x \le |x|$; hence all four hold for every $x$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, cases-exhaustive]

2.2 By trichotomy [L2] each pair $x, y$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.4-1.6, and in each $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$ for all $x, y$. [step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6, cases-exhaustive]

3.1 Let $c > 0$: if $|x| < c$ then $-c < -|x| \le x \le |x| < c$ by [step 2.1] and [L2], so $-c < x < c$; conversely if $-c < x < c$ then both $x < c$ and $-x < c$, and since $|x|$ equals $x$ or $-x$ by [L1], we get $|x| < c$, so $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$. [step 2.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b, c, d \in F$.

1. **Translation invariance.** If $a < b$ then $a + c < b + c$.
2. **Adding inequalities.** If $a < b$ and $c < d$ then $a + c < b + d$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b, c, d \in F$.

[L1] For $x, y \in F$, the relation $x < y$ means $y - x \in P$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] $P$ is closed under addition: if $u, v \in P$ then $u + v \in P$ (axiom O2 of [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a < b$; by the definition of the order this means $b - a \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.2 For every $c \in F$ the field identities give $(b + c) - (a + c) = b - a$. [algebra]

1.3 Assume moreover $c < d$; by the definition of the order this means $d - c \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.4 The field identities give $(b + d) - (a + c) = (b - a) + (d - c)$. [algebra]

2.1 Hence $(b + c) - (a + c) = b - a \in P$, which is exactly $a + c < b + c$, proving claim 1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1]

2.2 Since $b - a \in P$ and $d - c \in P$, closure under addition gives $(b - a) + (d - c) \in P$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, L2]

3.1 Therefore $(b + d) - (a + c) = (b - a) + (d - c) \in P$, which is exactly $a + c < b + d$, proving claim 2. [step 1.4, step 2.2, L1] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field, with field structure as in [[def-field]], and for
$n \ge 1$ let $n \cdot 1_F$ denote the canonical natural number
$\underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$, defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$
and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$. Then for every $n \ge 1$:

- $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$;
- the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$;
- $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ and $(mn) \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F)$ for all $m, n \ge 1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ whose canonical naturals are defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, with $0 \cdot 1_F = 0$.

[L1] $0 < 1_F$ in every ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] The order is compatible with addition and positives are closed under addition: $a < b$ implies $a + c < b + c$, and $a > 0$, $b > 0$ imply $a + b > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 1$: by definition $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, and $1_F > 0$. [L1, base]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: assume $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for some fixed $n \ge 1$. [ih]

1.3 By the recursion, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F - n \cdot 1_F = 1_F > 0$, so $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$. [given, L1]

1.4 Additive identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ by the recursion, and if $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ then $(m+n+1) \cdot 1_F = (m+n) \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + (n+1) \cdot 1_F$. [given, algebra]

2.1 Inductive step: $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ is a sum of two positives, by the hypothesis and $1_F > 0$, hence $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Iterating 1.3, for $m < n$ one has $m \cdot 1_F < n \cdot 1_F$, so $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing and therefore injective on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$. [step 1.3, L2]

2.3 Multiplicative identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m \cdot 1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(1 \cdot 1_F)$, and the step $(m(n+1)) \cdot 1_F = (mn + m) \cdot 1_F = (mn) \cdot 1_F + m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F) + (m \cdot 1_F)(1_F) = (m \cdot 1_F)((n+1) \cdot 1_F)$ uses 1.4 and distributivity. [step 1.4, algebra]

3.1 By induction on 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for every $n \ge 1$; with the strict increase 2.2 and the identities 1.4, 2.3, every claim holds. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 1.4, step 2.3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b, c \in F$.

1. If $a > 0$ and $b > 0$ then $ab > 0$.
2. If $a > 0$ and $b < 0$ then $ab < 0$.
3. If $a < 0$ and $b < 0$ then $ab > 0$.
4. If $c > 0$ then $a < b \iff ac < bc$.
5. If $c < 0$ then $a < b \iff bc < ac$ (multiplication by a negative reverses order).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b, c \in F$.

[L1] For $x, y \in F$: $x < y \iff y - x \in P$; $x > 0 \iff x \in P$; $x < 0 \iff -x \in P$; and (trichotomy) for each $x$ exactly one of $x \in P$, $x = 0$, $-x \in P$ holds, so $0 \notin P$ and $x \in P \Rightarrow x \neq 0$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] $P$ is closed under multiplication: if $u, v \in P$ then $uv \in P$ (axiom O2 of [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] In any field, $(-u)v = -(uv)$ and $(-u)(-v) = uv$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] In any field, $0 \cdot u = 0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a > 0$ and $b > 0$, i.e. $a \in P$ and $b \in P$; closure gives $ab \in P$, so $ab > 0$, proving claim 1. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.2 Assume $a > 0$ and $b < 0$, i.e. $a \in P$ and $-b \in P$; closure gives $a(-b) \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.3 Assume $a < 0$ and $b < 0$, i.e. $-a \in P$ and $-b \in P$; closure gives $(-a)(-b) \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.4 Assume $c > 0$ and $a < b$, i.e. $c \in P$ and $b - a \in P$; closure gives $(b - a)c \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.5 Assume $c < 0$ and $a < b$, i.e. $-c \in P$ and $b - a \in P$; closure gives $(b - a)(-c) \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

2.1 Since $a(-b) = -(ab)$ by L3, step 1.2 gives $-(ab) \in P$, so $ab < 0$, proving claim 2. [step 1.2, L3, L1]

2.2 Since $(-a)(-b) = ab$ by L3, step 1.3 gives $ab \in P$, so $ab > 0$, proving claim 3. [step 1.3, L3, L1]

2.3 By distributivity $(b - a)c = bc - ac$, so step 1.4 gives $bc - ac \in P$, i.e. $ac < bc$: this is the forward direction of claim 4. [step 1.4, algebra, L1]

2.4 By L3 and distributivity $(b - a)(-c) = -((b - a)c) = -(bc - ac) = ac - bc$, so step 1.5 gives $ac - bc \in P$, i.e. $bc < ac$: this is the forward direction of claim 5. [step 1.5, L3, algebra, L1]

3.1 Conversely, assume $c > 0$ and $ac < bc$; by trichotomy exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds. If $a = b$ then $ac = bc$, contradicting $ac < bc$; if $b < a$ then the argument of step 2.3 applied to the pair $b < a$ gives $bc < ac$, so $bc - ac \in P$ (from $ac < bc$) while $ac - bc \in P$ (from $bc < ac$), putting the element $bc - ac$ and its negative $ac - bc$ both in $P$, which trichotomy forbids; hence $a < b$: this completes claim 4. [assume-hyp, step 2.3, L4, L1, algebra]

4.1 Conversely, assume $c < 0$ and $bc < ac$; by trichotomy exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds. If $a = b$ then $ac = bc$, contradicting $bc < ac$; if $b < a$ then the argument of step 2.4 applied to the pair $b < a$ gives $ac < bc$, so $ac - bc \in P$ (from $bc < ac$) while $bc - ac \in P$ (from $ac < bc$), putting the element $ac - bc$ and its negative $bc - ac$ both in $P$, which trichotomy forbids; hence $a < b$: this completes claim 5.

## Statement

Write $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the image of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$
under the canonical embedding $q \mapsto \hat q$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), the
set usually written $\mathbb{Q}$ once the identification is made, and put
$X := \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the irrationals. Then:

1. $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$, that is,
   $\overline{\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}} = \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]);
2. $X$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$;
3. every nonempty open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable
   ([[def-countable]]).

Claim 2 is not a symmetry of claim 1: the rationals are dense because they are
*constructed* to approximate, whereas the irrationals are dense because there are
too many points in any interval for a countable set to exhaust it, which is why
claim 3 is proved alongside and used for it.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The canonical embedding $q \mapsto \hat q$ of $\mathbb{Q}$ into $\mathbb{R}$, its image $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, and the complement $X = \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$.

[L1] $\overline{A}$ is the set of points every neighbourhood of which meets $A$; $A$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ when $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L2] $N_\varepsilon(x) = (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon)$ for real $\varepsilon > 0$, and $x - \varepsilon < x + \varepsilon$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L3] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L4] Strictly between any two reals lies an element of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, and $q \mapsto \hat q$ is injective ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L5] $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-rationals-countable]]); an injection is a bijection onto its image, and $\approx$ is symmetric and transitive ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]], [[def-equinumerous]]).

[L6] Every subset of an at most countable set is at most countable, and uncountable means not at most countable ([[lem-subset-of-countable]], [[def-countable]]).

[L7] For $a < b$ the interval $(a,b)$ is uncountable ([[cor-interval-uncountable]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is dense: let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real; by [L2] one has $x - \varepsilon < x + \varepsilon$, so [L4] supplies $\hat q$ with $x - \varepsilon < \hat q < x + \varepsilon$, that is $\hat q \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$. Every real is therefore an adherent point of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and claim 1 follows from [L1]. [L1, L2, L4]

1.2 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is at most countable: the embedding is an injection of $\mathbb{Q}$ with image $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, hence a bijection onto it, so $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \approx \mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$. [L4, L5]

1.3 For all reals $a < b$ the interval $(a,b)$ is uncountable. [L7]

2.1 For all reals $a < b$ the interval $(a,b)$ contains an irrational: if it did not, then $(a,b) \subseteq \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, so $(a,b)$ would be a subset of an at most countable set by step 1.2 and hence at most countable by [L6], contradicting step 1.3. So some $z \in (a,b)$ lies in $X$. [step 1.2, step 1.3, L6]

2.2 Every nonempty open $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is uncountable: fix $x \in U$ and, by [L3], a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; by [L2] the set $N_\varepsilon(x)$ is the interval $(x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon)$ with $x - \varepsilon < x + \varepsilon$, hence uncountable by step 1.3. Were $U$ at most countable, its subset $N_\varepsilon(x)$ would be at most countable by [L6], which it is not; so $U$ is uncountable, which is claim 3. [step 1.3, L2, L3, L6, choose]

3.1 $X$ is dense: let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real; applying step 2.1 with $a = x - \varepsilon$ and $b = x + \varepsilon$ gives $z \in (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon) \cap X$, which is $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap X$ by [L2]. Every real is therefore an adherent point of $X$, so $\overline{X} = \mathbb{R}$ by [L1], which is claim 2. [step 2.1, L1, L2]

4.1 Claims 1, 2 and 3 are steps 1.1, 3.1 and 2.2, so both $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and its complement are dense in $\mathbb{R}$ and every nonempty open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable. [step 1.1, step 2.2, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Two dense sets can be disjoint.** $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and $X$ partition
  $\mathbb{R}$ and both are dense, so density says nothing about size: one of
  them is countable and the other is not
  ([[cor-irrationals-uncountable]]). What density does say is that neither has
  interior: a set whose complement is dense has empty interior, which is the
  computation carried out for $\mathbb{Q}$ in
  [[ex-closure-interior-boundary-of-q]].

- **Claim 3 is a statement about open sets, not about intervals.** It follows
  from the uncountability of intervals ([[cor-interval-uncountable]]) only
  because openness supplies an interval inside the set at each of its points.
  A nonempty set with empty interior can perfectly well be countable, as
  $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ shows.

- **An explicit irrational is not produced here.** Step 2.1 is a counting
  argument and exhibits nothing. The library does exhibit one separately,
  $\sqrt 2$ ([[thm-of-square-roots]], [[fs-sqrt2-rational]]), and an explicit
  irrational in a given interval $(a,b)$ can be built from it as
  $q_1 + (q_2 - q_1)/\sqrt 2$ for suitable rationals $q_1 < q_2$ in the
  interval; that route is longer and is not the one taken above.

This page develops the Riemann integral over ZF except at the points recorded
below. The only choice principle that appears anywhere on it is the Axiom of
Countable Choice ([[def-countable-choice]]); the full Axiom of Choice is never
used, and no claim is made anywhere that a use recorded here is *necessary*.

## The four entries that are easy to get wrong

**Selecting a tag in every subinterval is not countable choice.**
[[thm-darboux-equals-riemann]] picks, for a *single fixed* partition, one point
in each of its $n$ subintervals subject to a supremum condition. That family is
listed by the index $i < n$, and a family of nonempty sets listed by a natural
number has a choice function outright, by
[[lem-finite-choice]], which is a theorem of ZF proved by induction. (That
lemma is careful to state only the listed form, since no definition of
finiteness is available where it is proved; the listed form is what is used
here.) The
temptation to read this as a choice principle comes from the phrase "for each
$i$ pick a point"; the number of picks is what matters, and it is finite.

**"For each $n$ pick a partition" would be countable choice, and the page never
does it.** Both directions of [[thm-riemann-criterion]] and the whole of
[[thm-darboux-equals-riemann]] instantiate an existential a fixed, finite number
of times, once per $\varepsilon$ under consideration; no proof on this page ever
forms a sequence of partitions indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ and reasons about it. The
one place where a sequence of sets does appear is step 7.1 of
[[thm-lebesgue-criterion]], and that is exactly where the ledger records a cost.

**Only the forward half of [[thm-lebesgue-criterion]] costs anything.** The
implication "integrable $\Rightarrow$ the discontinuity set is null" exhibits
that set as $\bigcup_k E_{1/(k+1)}$ and applies
[[thm-countable-union-of-null-is-null]], which assumes $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ and
names its own single use. The converse, "null $\Rightarrow$ integrable", is a
theorem of ZF: [[lem-oscillation-superlevel-sets-are-closed]] and
[[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]] are choice-free,
[[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]] and [[lem-content-zero-implies-null]] are
choice-free, and the partition is built by Cousin's supremum construction, which
uses the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ and nothing else. This asymmetry is why
[[cor-countably-many-discontinuities-integrable]] appears in the table with no
cost at all: it uses the converse half only, together with
[[lem-countable-sets-are-null]], whose own statement records that no choice
principle is used there.

**Heine-Cantor is the page's other source, and it is a single use.**
[[thm-heine-cantor-r]] states that its proof invokes $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ exactly
once, to select one bad pair of points from each of countably many nonempty sets,
and that the implication it borrows from
[[thm-compact-iff-sequentially-compact-r]] — compact implies sequentially
compact — spends nothing. So [[thm-continuous-implies-integrable]] and
[[thm-finitely-many-discontinuities-integrable]] each inherit that one use and
add none of their own. The neighbouring ledger for the same expenditure on the
continuity page is [[rem-heine-criterion-choice-cost]].

## What is deliberately not claimed

Nothing here says that $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ is **necessary** for any of the three
theorems that use it. The independence questions for the Heine-Cantor theorem
and for the countable additivity of nullity over $\mathbb{R}$ are not settled in
this library, and no item on this page asserts anything about them. What the
table records is what the proofs on disk actually spend, and it is meant to be
checked against them rather than believed.

The one further caution is that a *later* proof of a result stated here could
spend less. The direct argument for [[thm-monotone-implies-integrable]] is kept
alongside the shorter route through
[[cor-countably-many-discontinuities-integrable]] precisely for that reason: the
direct one is elementary and quantitative, and both are choice-free, so nothing
is lost by keeping the pair.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]) and let $I \in \mathbb{R}$. The following are equivalent.

1. **(Darboux)** $f$ is Darboux integrable on $[a,b]$ with
   $\int_a^b f = I$ ([[def-darboux-integral]]).
2. **(Riemann)** For every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$
   such that
   $$\bigl|\,S(f,P,\xi) - I\,\bigr| \;<\; \varepsilon$$
   for **every** tagged partition $(P,\xi)$ of $[a,b]$ with $\|P\| < \delta$
   ([[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

**The quantifier over tagged partitions is universal, and that is the content.**
Condition 2 constrains every tagged partition of small mesh at once, tags
included; it is not a statement about one sequence of tagged partitions, and it
cannot be weakened to one. The companion page of this pair exhibits a
non-integrable function whose Riemann sums are constant along such a sequence.

**Boundedness is a hypothesis of both conditions as stated here.** Condition 1
presupposes it, since the Darboux sums of an unbounded function do not exist
([[def-darboux-sums]]); condition 2 makes sense for unbounded $f$ as well, and
in fact implies boundedness, but that implication is not proved here and is not
used: every application on this page starts from a bounded $f$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, a bounded $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $M \ge 0$ with $|f(x)| \le M$ for every $x \in [a,b]$, and a real $I$. Put $M_{+} := M + 1$, so $M_{+} > 0$ and $|f(x)| \le M_{+}$ for every $x$.

[L1] For a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[a,b]$: $n \ge 1$, the subintervals $I_i = [t_i,t_{i+1}]$ are nonempty, $\Delta_i = t_{i+1} - t_i > 0$, $\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = b-a$, and $\|P\| = \max\{\Delta_i : i < n\}$. The uniform partition $U_N$ into $N \ge 1$ parts has $\|U_N\| = (b-a)/\iota(N)$. The common refinement $P \vee P_0$ refines both, and $n_{P \vee P_0} \le n_P + n_{P_0} - 1$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-interval]]).

[L2] $L(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}m_i\Delta_i$ and $U(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}M_i\Delta_i$ with $m_i = \inf f[I_i]$ and $M_i = \sup f[I_i]$; $L(f,P) \le \underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,P)$; $f$ is integrable exactly when the two integrals coincide, and then $\int_a^b f$ is their common value ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L3] $S(f,P,\xi) = \sum_{i<n}f(\xi_i)\Delta_i$ for a tagging $\xi$ of $P$, and $L(f,P) \le S(f,P,\xi) \le U(f,P)$ when $f$ is bounded ([[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]]).

[L4] Riemann's criterion: a bounded $f$ is integrable if and only if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a partition $P$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$ ([[thm-riemann-criterion]]).

[L5] If $P'$ refines $P$ then $L(f,P) \le L(f,P')$, $U(f,P') \le U(f,P)$, and moreover $U(f,P) - U(f,P') \le 2M_{+}\,\iota(n'-n)\,\|P\|$ and $L(f,P') - L(f,P) \le 2M_{+}\,\iota(n'-n)\,\|P\|$ ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]]).

[L6] $\varepsilon$-characterisations: if $u = \sup S$ with $S$ nonempty then for every real $\eta > 0$ there is $s \in S$ with $s > u - \eta$; dually for the infimum ([[lem-sup-epsilon]], [[lem-inf-epsilon]]).

[L7] A family of nonempty sets **indexed by a natural number** $n$ has a choice function, and this is a theorem of ZF; the family used below is indexed by $i < n$, which is exactly that listed form. [[lem-finite-choice]] states it in that form and expressly declines to identify it with "every finite family of nonempty sets has a choice function", no definition of finiteness being available where it is proved ([[lem-finite-choice]], [[def-choice-function]]).

[L8] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N) < \eta$; $\iota$ is nonnegative, additive and nondecreasing on $\mathbb{N}$, and $\iota(N) > 0$ for $N \ge 1$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L9] Finite sums: additivity, scaling, monotonicity in the terms ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L10] Ordered-field arithmetic and the absolute value: adding a constant and multiplying by a positive quantity preserve an inequality; the order is total and transitive; $|x| < c$ exactly when $-c < x < c$ for $c > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[cor-of-one-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Condition 2 implies condition 1.** Assume condition 2 and let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. Fix $\delta > 0$ as in condition 2 for this $\varepsilon$, and put $\theta := \varepsilon/(b-a) > 0$ by [L10]. [given, L10, choose]

1.2 **Condition 1 implies condition 2; this half of the proof is steps 1.2, 2.2, 2.3, 3.3, 4.2, 5.2 and 6.2, and its symbols are its own.** Assume $f$ is integrable with $\int_a^b f = I$ and let a real $\eta > 0$ be given. By [L4] fix a partition $P_0 = (n_0, t^0)$ with $U(f,P_0) - L(f,P_0) < \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$. [given, L4, L10, choose]

2.1 A partition of mesh below $\delta$ exists: by [L8] fix $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N) < \delta/(b-a)$ and take $P := U_N$, so $\|P\| = (b-a)/\iota(N) < \delta$ by [L1] and [L10]. Write $P = (n,t)$. [step 1.1, L1, L8, L10, choose]

2.2 By [L2] and integrability, $L(f,P_0) \le \underline{\int_a^b} f = I = \overline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,P_0)$. Hence $U(f,P_0) - I \le U(f,P_0) - L(f,P_0) < \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$ and $I - L(f,P_0) \le U(f,P_0) - L(f,P_0) < \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$, that is $U(f,P_0) < I + \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$ and $L(f,P_0) > I - \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$. [step 1.2, L2, L10]

2.3 Put $\delta_0 := \eta \cdot \bigl(8\,M_{+}\,\iota(n_0)\bigr)^{-1}$, a positive real since $M_{+} > 0$ and $\iota(n_0) > 0$ by [L8] and $n_0 \ge 1$ by [L1]. [step 1.2, L1, L8, L10, construct]

3.1 For each $i < n$ the set $X_i := \{\, x \in I_i : f(x) > M_i - \theta \,\}$ is nonempty by [L6], since $M_i = \sup f[I_i]$ and $f[I_i]$ is nonempty by [L1]. By [L7] the finite family $\{X_i : i < n\}$ has a choice function $g$; put $\xi_i := g(X_i)$ for $i < n$ and $\xi_k := b$ for $k \ge n$, a tagging of $P$. [step 2.1, L1, L2, L6, L7, choose]

3.2 Likewise the sets $Y_i := \{\, x \in I_i : f(x) < m_i + \theta \,\}$ are nonempty by [L6], and [L7] supplies a tagging $\zeta$ of $P$ with $\zeta_i \in Y_i$ for $i < n$. [step 2.1, L1, L2, L6, L7, choose]

3.3 Let $(Q,\upsilon)$ be any tagged partition of $[a,b]$ with $\|Q\| < \delta_0$, and write $Q = (n_Q,u)$ and $R := Q \vee P_0$, with $R = (n_R, r)$. By [L1], $R$ refines both $Q$ and $P_0$, and $n_R - n_Q \le n_0 - 1$, so $\iota(n_R - n_Q) \le \iota(n_0)$ by [L8]. [step 2.3, L1, L8, given]

4.1 $S(f,P,\xi) \ge U(f,P) - \varepsilon$: by step 3.1, $f(\xi_i) \ge M_i - \theta$ for $i < n$, so multiplying by $\Delta_i > 0$ and summing gives $S(f,P,\xi) \ge \sum_{i<n}(M_i - \theta)\Delta_i = U(f,P) - \theta\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = U(f,P) - \theta(b-a) = U(f,P) - \varepsilon$, by [L9], [L1] and [L3]. Symmetrically $S(f,P,\zeta) \le L(f,P) + \varepsilon$. [step 3.1, step 3.2, L1, L3, L9, L10]

4.2 By [L5] applied to the refinement $R$ of $Q$, $U(f,Q) - U(f,R) \le 2M_{+}\iota(n_R-n_Q)\|Q\| \le 2M_{+}\iota(n_0)\delta_0 = \eta \cdot 4^{-1}$, and likewise $L(f,R) - L(f,Q) \le \eta \cdot 4^{-1}$. [step 2.3, step 3.3, L5, L8, L10]

5.1 By condition 2 both $|S(f,P,\xi) - I| < \varepsilon$ and $|S(f,P,\zeta) - I| < \varepsilon$, since $\|P\| < \delta$. Hence $U(f,P) \le S(f,P,\xi) + \varepsilon < I + 2\varepsilon$ and $L(f,P) \ge S(f,P,\zeta) - \varepsilon > I - 2\varepsilon$, by step 4.1 and [L10]. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 4.1, L10]

5.2 By [L5] applied to the refinement $R$ of $P_0$, $U(f,R) \le U(f,P_0)$ and $L(f,R) \ge L(f,P_0)$. Combining with step 4.2 and step 2.2: $U(f,Q) \le U(f,R) + \eta \cdot 4^{-1} \le U(f,P_0) + \eta \cdot 4^{-1} < I + \eta \cdot 2^{-1} + \eta \cdot 4^{-1}$, and symmetrically $L(f,Q) > I - \eta \cdot 2^{-1} - \eta \cdot 4^{-1}$. [step 2.2, step 3.3, step 4.2, L5, L10]

6.1 By [L2], $\overline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,P) < I + 2\varepsilon$ and $\underline{\int_a^b} f \ge L(f,P) > I - 2\varepsilon$, and since $\underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f$ by [L2], both integrals lie strictly between $I - 2\varepsilon$ and $I + 2\varepsilon$; in particular $\bigl|\overline{\int_a^b} f - I\bigr| \le 2\varepsilon$ and $\bigl|\underline{\int_a^b} f - I\bigr| \le 2\varepsilon$. [step 5.1, L2, L10]

6.2 By [L3], $L(f,Q) \le S(f,Q,\upsilon) \le U(f,Q)$, so step 5.2 gives $I - \eta \cdot 2^{-1} - \eta \cdot 4^{-1} < S(f,Q,\upsilon) < I + \eta \cdot 2^{-1} + \eta \cdot 4^{-1}$, whence $|S(f,Q,\upsilon) - I| < \eta \cdot 2^{-1} + \eta \cdot 4^{-1} < \eta$ by [L10]. Since $(Q,\upsilon)$ was an arbitrary tagged partition of mesh below $\delta_0$, condition 2 holds with this $\delta_0$. [step 5.2, L3, L10]

7.1 Step 6.1 holds for **every** real $\varepsilon > 0$. If $\overline{\int_a^b} f \ne I$, taking $\varepsilon := \bigl|\overline{\int_a^b} f - I\bigr| \cdot 4^{-1} > 0$ would give $\bigl|\overline{\int_a^b} f - I\bigr| \le \bigl|\overline{\int_a^b} f - I\bigr| \cdot 2^{-1}$, which is false for a positive quantity; so $\overline{\int_a^b} f = I$, and the same argument gives $\underline{\int_a^b} f = I$. Hence $f$ is integrable with $\int_a^b f = I$ by [L2], which is condition 1. [step 6.1, L2, L10]

8.1 Steps 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 5.1, 6.1 and 7.1 prove that condition 2 implies condition 1; steps 1.2, 2.2, 2.3, 3.3, 4.2, 5.2 and 6.2 prove the converse. The two halves share no symbol, the first working with $\varepsilon, \delta, P, \xi, \zeta, \theta$ and the second with $\eta, \delta_0, P_0, Q, \upsilon, R$, and together they give the stated equivalence. [step 7.1, step 6.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the Riemann condition costs in choice: nothing beyond ZF.** The only selection made anywhere above is in steps 3.1 and 3.2, where a tag is picked in each of the $n$ subintervals of one fixed partition. That family is listed by the index $i < n$, and a family of nonempty sets listed by a natural number has a choice function outright ([[lem-finite-choice]]), with no appeal to any choice axiom. Every other existential in the proof is instantiated once. This is recorded in [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].

- **Why the mesh of the coarse partition is the right quantity.** Step 4.2 is the only place where the mesh hypothesis is spent, and it is spent through the quantitative clause of [[lem-refinement-inequalities]]. The symbols there are those of the second half: adding the at most $n_0 - 1$ interior points of $P_0$ to the arbitrary partition $Q$ can change each Darboux sum by at most $2M_{+}$ times the total length of the affected subintervals, and each of those has length below $\delta_0$, the mesh bound imposed on $Q$. The number $n_0$ is fixed **before** $\delta_0$ is chosen, in step 1.2 against step 2.3, which is why the argument is not circular.

- **The two conditions are not symmetric in what they presuppose.** Condition 1 names the integral as a supremum and an infimum and needs the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ to make sense; condition 2 names it as a limit of sums and could be stated over any ordered field. What the theorem says is that on $\mathbb{R}$ the two coincide, so the numerical picture and the order-theoretic one describe the same object.

- **The value $I$ is not a free parameter after the fact.** If condition 2 holds for $I$ and for $I'$ then $|I - I'| < 2\varepsilon$ for every $\varepsilon > 0$, by evaluating both at one tagged partition of small enough mesh, so $I = I'$. The integral is therefore determined by condition 2 alone, as it is by condition 1.

## Statement

Every complete ordered field $F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) is Archimedean:
for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$,
where $n \cdot 1_F$ is the canonical natural of the ordered field $F$
([[def-ordered-field]]). Equivalently, the canonical naturals are cofinal in $F$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $F$; write $A = \{\, n \cdot 1_F : n \ge 1 \,\}$ for the set of its canonical naturals.

[L1] Least-upper-bound property: every nonempty $S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound $\sup S \in F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Each canonical natural satisfies $n \cdot 1_F > 0$, one has $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L3] $0 < 1_F$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $F$ is not Archimedean: there is some $x \in F$ with $n \cdot 1_F \le x$ for all $n \ge 1$, that is, $x$ is an upper bound of $A$. [assume-contra]

2.1 The set $A$ is nonempty, since $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F \in A$, and it is bounded above by $x$. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 By the least-upper-bound property, $A$ has a least upper bound $s = \sup A \in F$. [step 2.1, L1]

4.1 Since $1_F > 0$, we have $s - 1_F < s$; as $s$ is the least upper bound, $s - 1_F$ is not an upper bound of $A$. [step 3.1, L3]

5.1 Hence there is some $m \ge 1$ with $m \cdot 1_F > s - 1_F$. [step 4.1]

6.1 Adding $1_F$ to both sides, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F > s$. [step 5.1, L2]

7.1 But $(m+1) \cdot 1_F \in A$, so $(m+1) \cdot 1_F \le s$ because $s$ is an upper bound of $A$, contradicting 6.1. [step 6.1, step 3.1, L2]

8.1 The assumption is therefore untenable, so $F$ is Archimedean. [step 7.1, discharge-contradiction] ∎
