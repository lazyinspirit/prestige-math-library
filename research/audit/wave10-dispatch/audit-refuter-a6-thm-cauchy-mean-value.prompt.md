## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` proof, actively search for a counterexample. A false
public claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or
materially inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is
nonfatal.

Return no more than 450 words, exactly in this shape:

## Statement

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$ and let $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be
continuous on $[a,b]$ ([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-interval]]) and
differentiable at every point of $(a,b)$ as functions on $[a,b]$
([[def-derivative]]). Then there is $c \in (a,b)$ with

$$\bigl(f(b)-f(a)\bigr)\,g'(c) \;=\; \bigl(g(b)-g(a)\bigr)\,f'(c) .$$

**The statement is a product identity, and that is deliberate.** The familiar
quotient form

$$\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)} \;=\; \frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)}$$

is not asserted here, and it is not equivalent: its left side needs
$g(b) \ne g(a)$ and its right side needs $g'(c) \ne 0$, and neither follows from
the hypotheses. The product form above needs neither, holds under exactly the
hypotheses stated, and specialises to the quotient form whenever both
denominators happen to be nonzero. The companion page exhibits an $f$ and a $g$
for which the quotient form is meaningless while the product form holds.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and functions $f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, both continuous on $[a,b]$ and both differentiable at every point of $(a,b)$.

[L1] Rolle's theorem ([[thm-rolle]]): a function continuous on $[a,b]$, differentiable at every point of $(a,b)$ and taking equal values at $a$ and at $b$ has a vanishing derivative at some point of $(a,b)$.

[L2] Algebra of continuous functions ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], claim 1): sums and scalar multiples of functions continuous on a set are continuous on that set.

[L3] Algebra of derivatives ([[thm-algebra-of-derivatives]], claims 1 and 2): at a limit point of the common domain, a sum of functions differentiable there is differentiable with the sum of the derivatives, and a scalar multiple with the scalar multiple of the derivative.

[L4] Every point of $(a,b)$ lies in $[a,b]$ and is a limit point of $[a,b]$, since $[a,b]$ is order-convex with at least two elements when $a < b$ ([[def-derivative]], [[def-interval]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Put $\lambda := f(b) - f(a)$ and $\mu := g(b) - g(a)$, two reals, and define $h : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ by $h(x) := \lambda\,g(x) - \mu\,f(x)$. [construct]

2.1 $h$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, being the sum of the scalar multiples $\lambda g$ and $(-\mu) f$ of two functions continuous on $[a,b]$. [step 1.1, L2]

2.2 $h$ is differentiable at every $c \in (a,b)$ with $h'(c) = \lambda\,g'(c) - \mu\,f'(c)$: such a $c$ is a limit point of $[a,b]$ by [L4], and $f$ and $g$ are differentiable there, so the scalar-multiple and sum rules of [L3] apply on the domain $[a,b]$. [step 1.1, L3, L4]

2.3 $h(a) = h(b)$. Expanding, $h(a) = \bigl(f(b)-f(a)\bigr)g(a) - \bigl(g(b)-g(a)\bigr)f(a) = f(b)g(a) - f(a)g(a) - g(b)f(a) + g(a)f(a) = f(b)g(a) - g(b)f(a)$, and $h(b) = \bigl(f(b)-f(a)\bigr)g(b) - \bigl(g(b)-g(a)\bigr)f(b) = f(b)g(b) - f(a)g(b) - g(b)f(b) + g(a)f(b) = g(a)f(b) - f(a)g(b)$. The two expressions are the same. [step 1.1, algebra]

3.1 By steps 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 the function $h$ satisfies every hypothesis of [L1], so there is $c \in (a,b)$ with $h'(c) = 0$, that is $\lambda\,g'(c) - \mu\,f'(c) = 0$, that is $\bigl(f(b)-f(a)\bigr)g'(c) = \bigl(g(b)-g(a)\bigr)f'(c)$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the auxiliary function comes from.** $h$ is built so that the two cross terms $f(a)g(a)$ and $f(b)g(b)$ cancel against themselves at the two endpoints, leaving the same antisymmetric expression $f(b)g(a) - f(a)g(b)$ at each. Nothing is optimised and nothing is guessed: the two coefficients are forced, up to a common scalar, by the requirement $h(a) = h(b)$.

- **The ordinary mean value theorem is the case $g(x) = x$**, and it is recorded as the next item rather than reproved. Cauchy's theorem is the more general statement and is proved first for that reason, not because it is harder: it costs one application of Rolle either way.

- **What fails in the quotient form.** If $g(a) = g(b)$ the left side is not a real number at all, and the theorem still says something: it says $\bigl(f(b)-f(a)\bigr)g'(c) = 0$ for some $c \in (a,b)$. That is the case worked out in [[cex-cauchy-mean-value-quotient-form-needs-a-nonvanishing-derivative]].

That is legitimate: $c$ is a limit point of the domain\n   $A \\setminus \\{c\\}$ of $q_{f,c}$, so at most one real can satisfy the\n   $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ condition, by [[lem-function-limit-unique]] applied to\n   $q_{f,c}$. Two reals both meeting the condition are therefore equal, and the\n   symbol denotes.\n2. **Meaningfulness.** The hypothesis that $c$ is a limit point of $A$ is not\n   decoration. At an **isolated** point of $A$ the punctured condition\n   $0 < |x - c| < \\delta$ is met by no point of the domain at all, so the\n   $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ formula is satisfied vacuously by *every* real at\n   once; this is why [[def-function-limit]] leaves the limit undefined there,\n   and it is why this library defines $f'(c)$ only at a limit point of $A$. At\n   an isolated point of its domain a function is neither differentiable nor\n   non-differentiable here: the question is not posed.\n\n**The limit sees only $A \\setminus \\{c\\}$, so how the difference quotient is\nextended to $c$ is irrelevant.** Let $Q : A \\to \\mathbb{R}$ agree with\n$q_{f,c}$ at every point of $A \\setminus \\{c\\}$, and let $L \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nThen $\\lim_{x \\to c} Q(x) = L$ if and only if $\\lim_{x \\to c} q_{f,c}(x) = L$.\nBoth conditions read: for every real $\\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real\n$\\delta > 0$ such that every point $x$ of the relevant domain with\n$0 < |x - c| < \\delta$ satisfies $|{\\cdot} - L| < \\varepsilon$\n([[def-function-limit]]). The clause $0 < |x - c|$ removes $x = c$ from both\nquantifiers, so in both cases the points quantified over are exactly the\n$x \\in A \\setminus \\{c\\}$ with $0 < |x - c| < \\delta$, at which $Q$ and\n$q_{f,c}$ take the same value. The two conditions are the same condition.\n\n**Differentiability on a set.** For $S \\subseteq A$, $f$ is **differentiable on\n$S$** when it is differentiable at every $c \\in S$; implicit in that phrase is\nthat every point of $S$ is a limit point of $A$. $f$ is **differentiable** when\nit is differentiable on the whole of $A$.\n\n**Restriction of the domain.** Let $B \\subseteq A$, let $c \\in B$ and suppose\n$c$ is a limit point of $B$. If $f$ is differentiable at $c$, then so is the\nrestriction $f|_B : B \\to \\mathbb{R}$, and\n\n$$(f|_B)'(c) \\;=\\; f'(c) .$$\n\nIndeed $B \\setminus \\{c\\} \\subseteq A \\setminus \\{c\\}$; the displayed identity\nof punctured neighbourhoods above, applied to $B$, shows that $c$ is a limit\npoint of $B \\setminus \\{c\\}$; the difference quotient $q_{f|_B, c}$ is the\nrestriction of $q_{f,c}$ to $B \\setminus \\{c\\}$, since $f|_B(c) = f(c)$; and\nclaim 2 of [[lem-limit-is-local]] carries the limit to that restriction.\n\n**Every point of a nondegenerate interval is a limit point of it.** Let\n$J \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ be order-convex ([[def-interval]]) with at least two\nelements and let $p \\in J$.

## Statement refuted

**Refuted claim:** let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$ and let
$f, g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $[a,b]$
([[def-continuity-real]]) and differentiable at every point of $(a,b)$
([[def-derivative]]). Then there is $c \in (a,b)$ with

$$\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)} \;=\; \frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)} .$$

This is the shape in which Cauchy's mean value theorem is usually remembered,
and it is not what [[thm-cauchy-mean-value]] says. It is false as stated,
because under the hypotheses given neither quotient need be a real number at
all. The witness below makes both denominators vanish.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The reals $a := -1$ and $b := 1$ and the functions $f, g : [-1,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ with $f(x) := x^{3}$ and $g(x) := x^{2}$ ([[def-integer-power]], [[def-interval]]); numerals denote canonical naturals ([[def-canonical-natural]]).

[L1] Power rule and restriction ([[lem-derivative-of-a-power]], claim 2, and [[def-derivative]]): $x \mapsto x^{n}$ on $\mathbb{R}$ is differentiable at every real $c$ with derivative $\iota(n)c^{\,n-1}$; every point of the order-convex set $[-1,1]$, which has at least two elements, is a limit point of it ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-interval]]); and a function differentiable at such a point stays differentiable there after restriction, with the same derivative.

[L2] Continuity ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], claim 5, [[def-continuity-real]]): $x \mapsto x^{n}$ is continuous at every point of its domain.

[L3] Cauchy's mean value theorem ([[thm-cauchy-mean-value]]), in its product form: under the hypotheses above there is $c \in (a,b)$ with $\bigl(f(b)-f(a)\bigr)g'(c) = \bigl(g(b)-g(a)\bigr)f'(c)$.

[L4] Rolle's theorem ([[thm-rolle]]): a function continuous on $[a,b]$, differentiable at every point of $(a,b)$ and taking equal values at the endpoints has a vanishing derivative somewhere in $(a,b)$.

[L5] Signs and powers ([[def-integer-power]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[lem-power-monotone]]): the recursion $a^{n+1} = a^{n}a$ with $a^{0} = 1$ gives $(-1)^{2} = (-1)(-1) = 1$, the product of two negatives being positive ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]), and $(-1)^{3} = (-1)^{2}(-1) = -1$; that $1^{n} = 1$ for every natural $n$ is claim 4 of [[lem-power-monotone]] and is not read off [[def-integer-power]].

[L6] Canonical naturals ([[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]): $\iota(1) = 1$, $\iota(m+n) = \iota(m)+\iota(n)$ and $\iota(mn) = \iota(m)\iota(n)$ for $m, n \ge 1$; in particular $\iota(2)\iota(2) = \iota(4) > 0$, so $\iota(4) \ne 0$.

[L7] Division by $0$ is not defined: $0$ has no multiplicative inverse in a field ([[def-field]]).

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L2] both $f$ and $g$ are continuous on $[-1,1]$, and by [L1] both are differentiable at every $c \in [-1,1]$, with $f'(c) = \iota(3)c^{2}$ and $g'(c) = \iota(2)c^{1} = \iota(2)c$, using [L5] for $c^{1} = c$. So the pair $(f,g)$ satisfies every hypothesis of the refuted claim, and of [L3], with $a = -1$ and $b = 1$. [L1, L2, L5]

1.2 By [L5], $f(1) = 1$, $f(-1) = -1$, $g(1) = 1$ and $g(-1) = 1$. Hence $f(b)-f(a) = 1 - (-1) = \iota(2)$ and $g(b)-g(a) = 1 - 1 = 0$. [L5, L6]

2.1 The left-hand side of the refuted claim names no real number: its denominator $g(b)-g(a)$ is $0$ by step 1.2, and $0$ has no inverse by [L7]. So there is no $c$ for which the asserted equation holds, since the equation cannot even be formed; the claim fails on this pair. [step 1.2, L7]

2.2 The right-hand side fails as well at one point of the interval: $g'(0) = \iota(2) \cdot 0 = 0$ by step 1.1, so the quotient $f'(c)/g'(c)$ is undefined at $c = 0$, again by [L7]. [step 1.1, L7]

2.3 **The product form is untouched.** By [L3] there is $c \in (-1,1)$ with $\bigl(f(b)-f(a)\bigr)g'(c) = \bigl(g(b)-g(a)\bigr)f'(c)$, which by steps 1.1 and 1.2 reads $\iota(2)\,\iota(2)c = 0 \cdot \iota(3)c^{2}$, that is $\iota(4)c = 0$; since $\iota(4) \ne 0$ by [L6], this forces $c = 0$. And $c = 0$ does lie in $(-1,1)$ and does satisfy the identity, both sides being $0$. So [L3] holds on this pair, with $c = 0$ its only admissible point. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L3, L6]

3.1 The vanishing of $g(b)-g(a)$ is not an accident of the choice. By step 1.2 one has $g(-1) = g(1)$, so [L4] already forces $g'$ to vanish at some point of $(-1,1)$, and by step 2.3 that point is $c = 0$, the same point the product form produces. So on this pair every quotient the refuted claim writes down is undefined, while [L3] is satisfied; the quotient form needs hypotheses the product form does not, and as stated it is false. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, L4] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the quotient form would need.** Two extra hypotheses, and they are of different kinds: $g(b) \ne g(a)$, a condition on the endpoints, and $g'(c) \ne 0$ at the point produced, a condition on a point one does not choose. The second is the awkward one, since the theorem hands back a $c$ and says nothing about it. This is why [[thm-cauchy-mean-value]] is stated as a product identity in this library, with no hypothesis on $g'$ at all.

- **A cheaper repair than a hypothesis on $g'$.** If $g(b) \ne g(a)$ then, by [[thm-rolle]] read contrapositively, nothing forces $g'$ to vanish; and the product identity may then be divided by $g(b)-g(a)$ to give $\bigl(f(b)-f(a)\bigr)/\bigl(g(b)-g(a)\bigr) \cdot g'(c) = f'(c)$, which is a true statement with no division by $g'(c)$ anywhere. That is the form worth remembering.

- **The witness is the smallest natural one.** $g(x) = x^{2}$ is even and the interval is symmetric about $0$, which is the whole of the mechanism; any even $g$ on a symmetric interval does the same. The choice $f(x) = x^{3}$ only makes $f(b) - f(a)$ nonzero, so that the failure is not hidden by both sides vanishing for a trivial reason.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field with its order and
absolute value ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]), and
neighbourhoods are those of [[def-neighbourhood-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Then
$f$ is **continuous at $c$** when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

with $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ ranging over the **positive reals**. In the
language of neighbourhoods: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ with

$$f\bigl(A \cap N_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \;\subseteq\; N_{\varepsilon}\bigl(f(c)\bigr).$$

$f$ is **continuous on $A$** when it is continuous at every point of $A$.

**The point $c$ is required to lie in $A$, and the condition is unpunctured.**
Both differ from [[def-function-limit]], and deliberately. There the quantifier
runs over $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, which removes $x = c$; here $x = c$ is allowed,
and at $x = c$ the implication reads $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$, which is
automatic. So allowing $x = c$ costs nothing, and it is what lets the definition
be stated at every point of $A$, including the points where no limit exists.

**Three clauses, and all three are part of the definition.**

1. **At a limit point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is a limit point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]). Then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if the
   limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) \;=\; f(c)$$
   ([[def-function-limit]]). Indeed, for a given $\varepsilon > 0$ a $\delta$
   witnessing continuity witnesses the limit condition, because the limit
   condition quantifies over a subset of the points continuity quantifies over;
   and conversely a $\delta$ witnessing $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$ witnesses
   continuity, because the one point it omits, $x = c$, satisfies
   $|f(c) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ anyway.

2. **At an isolated point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is an isolated point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so that $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ for some real
   $\eta > 0$. Then **every** $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$: take
   $\delta := \eta$, so that the only $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ is $c$
   itself, and $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$.

3. **On a set.** Continuity on $A$ is continuity at each point of $A$, and
   nothing more. It is not a condition relating $f$ to points outside $A$.

Every point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$,
and never both ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so clauses 1 and 2 between them describe
continuity at every point of $A$.

**This is not the raw $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula of
[[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]].** That item records what goes
wrong when the *punctured* formula of [[def-function-limit]] is written down at
an arbitrary point of the domain: at an isolated point it is satisfied
vacuously by every real $L$ at once, so it defines nothing, and this library
therefore leaves $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ **undefined** at an isolated point.
Continuity at an isolated point is a different matter: the formula above is not
vacuous — it is a genuine condition on $f(c)$, satisfied because $f(c)$ is the
only value being compared with itself — and it names a single, well-defined
property. The limit is undefined there; the continuity is defined, and is
automatic. Clause 1 is the only place where the two notions meet, and it is
stated only where the limit exists as a notion.

**Where the distinction disappears.** If $A$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), then every $c \in A$ has some
$N_{\eta}(c) \subseteq A$, and a punctured neighbourhood is never empty
([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), so every point of $A$ is a limit point of $A$ and
clause 1 covers the whole of $A$. The same holds when $A$ is a nondegenerate
interval ([[def-interval]]). Isolated points are what force clause 2 to exist at
all, and they occur as soon as $A$ is allowed to be an arbitrary subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, as in $A = \{0\} \cup [1,2]$.

## Remarks

- **Continuity is local.** If $\eta > 0$ and $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agrees with
  $f$ on $A \cap N_{\eta}(c)$, then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if $g$
  is: any $\delta$ may be replaced by $\min\{\delta, \eta\}$, after which the
  condition only ever evaluates the two functions where they agree. So
  continuity at $c$ sees only an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of $c$, exactly
  as the limit does ([[lem-limit-is-local]]).

- **Continuity passes to subsets of the domain.** If $B \subseteq A$ and
  $c \in B$, then continuity of $f$ at $c$ gives continuity of the restriction
  $f|_B$ at $c$, with the same $\delta$: the condition on $f|_B$ quantifies over
  fewer points. The converse fails, and the standard witness is the indicator of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ restricted to $\mathbb{Q}$, which is constant and hence
  continuous, while the indicator itself is continuous nowhere
  ([[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]]).

- **The radius is a real number.** As in [[def-neighbourhood-r]], $\varepsilon$
  and $\delta$ range over the positive reals here. Restricting either quantifier
  to the positive rationals defines the same relation, by the passage recorded
  in [[def-function-limit]]: below every positive real lies a positive rational
  ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and a real $\delta$ may be shrunk to a rational
  one below it.

- **The word *continuous* is used for two things in this library, and they
  agree.** [[def-metric-continuity]] defines continuity of a map between metric
  spaces, and $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ carries the metric $d(x,y) = |x-y|$. The
  two notions coincide, and that is proved, not assumed:
  [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]] is the dictionary, and it is stated on
  this page precisely so that no later item has to guess.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), neighbourhoods are those of
[[def-neighbourhood-r]] and limit points those of [[def-limit-point-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$ be a
**limit point of $A$**. The **difference quotient of $f$ at $c$** is the function

$$q_{f,c} : A \setminus \{c\} \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad q_{f,c}(x) := \frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c} .$$

The division is legitimate at every point of the domain, since $x \ne c$ gives
$x - c \ne 0$.

**The point $c$ is a limit point of $A \setminus \{c\}$, not merely of $A$.**
For every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the punctured neighbourhood
$N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c)$ omits $c$, so

$$N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c) \cap A \;=\; N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c) \cap (A \setminus \{c\}) ,$$

and the left-hand side is nonempty because $c$ is a limit point of $A$. So
$q_{f,c}$ is a function on a set having $c$ as a limit point, and
$\lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x)$ is a notion that [[def-function-limit]] defines.

$f$ is **differentiable at $c$** when that limit exists, and then the
**derivative of $f$ at $c$** is

$$f'(c) \;:=\; \lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x) \;=\; \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c} .$$

**Two obligations are carried by that notation, and both are discharged here.**

1. **Uniqueness.** Writing $f'(c)$ treats the right-hand side as a name for a
   single real number. That is legitimate: $c$ is a limit point of the domain
   $A \setminus \{c\}$ of $q_{f,c}$, so at most one real can satisfy the
   $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ condition, by [[lem-function-limit-unique]] applied to
   $q_{f,c}$. Two reals both meeting the condition are therefore equal, and the
   symbol denotes.
2. **Meaningfulness.** The hypothesis that $c$ is a limit point of $A$ is not
   decoration. At an **isolated** point of $A$ the punctured condition
   $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ is met by no point of the domain at all, so the
   $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula is satisfied vacuously by *every* real at
   once; this is why [[def-function-limit]] leaves the limit undefined there,
   and it is why this library defines $f'(c)$ only at a limit point of $A$. At
   an isolated point of its domain a function is neither differentiable nor
   non-differentiable here: the question is not posed.

**The limit sees only $A \setminus \{c\}$, so how the difference quotient is
extended to $c$ is irrelevant.** Let $Q : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agree with
$q_{f,c}$ at every point of $A \setminus \{c\}$, and let $L \in \mathbb{R}$.
Then $\lim_{x \to c} Q(x) = L$ if and only if $\lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x) = L$.
Both conditions read: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ such that every point $x$ of the relevant domain with
$0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|{\cdot} - L| < \varepsilon$
([[def-function-limit]]). The clause $0 < |x - c|$ removes $x = c$ from both
quantifiers, so in both cases the points quantified over are exactly the
$x \in A \setminus \{c\}$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, at which $Q$ and
$q_{f,c}$ take the same value. The two conditions are the same condition.

**Differentiability on a set.** For $S \subseteq A$, $f$ is **differentiable on
$S$** when it is differentiable at every $c \in S$; implicit in that phrase is
that every point of $S$ is a limit point of $A$. $f$ is **differentiable** when
it is differentiable on the whole of $A$.

**Restriction of the domain.** Let $B \subseteq A$, let $c \in B$ and suppose
$c$ is a limit point of $B$. If $f$ is differentiable at $c$, then so is the
restriction $f|_B : B \to \mathbb{R}$, and

$$(f|_B)'(c) \;=\; f'(c) .$$

Indeed $B \setminus \{c\} \subseteq A \setminus \{c\}$; the displayed identity
of punctured neighbourhoods above, applied to $B$, shows that $c$ is a limit
point of $B \setminus \{c\}$; the difference quotient $q_{f|_B, c}$ is the
restriction of $q_{f,c}$ to $B \setminus \{c\}$, since $f|_B(c) = f(c)$; and
claim 2 of [[lem-limit-is-local]] carries the limit to that restriction.

**Every point of a nondegenerate interval is a limit point of it.** Let
$J \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be order-convex ([[def-interval]]) with at least two
elements and let $p \in J$. Choose $q \in J$ with $q \ne p$, and let a real
$\varepsilon > 0$ be given. If $p < q$, put $y := p + \tfrac{1}{2}\min\{\varepsilon,\ q - p\}$;
then $p < y$, and $y - p \le \tfrac{1}{2}(q-p) < q - p$, so $p < y < q$ and
order-convexity gives $y \in J$, while $0 < |y - p| < \varepsilon$. If $q < p$,
the point $y := p - \tfrac{1}{2}\min\{\varepsilon,\ p - q\}$ serves in the same
way. So $N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(p) \cap J \ne \varnothing$ for every real
$\varepsilon > 0$, that is, $p$ is a limit point of $J$
([[def-limit-point-r]]).

Consequently, for $f$ defined on a nondegenerate interval $I$, the symbol
$f'(c)$ is meaningful at **every** $c \in I$, endpoints included. At an endpoint
the difference quotient is taken over the points of $I$ lying on the one side
that is available, so what other texts call a one-sided derivative is, here,
simply the derivative of $f$ on $I$.

## Remarks

- **Notation.** $f'(c)$ and $\frac{df}{dx}(c)$ denote the same real number, and
  this library uses the first. Neither is an operation performed on a symbol
  $x$: the variable in the second is a name for the argument and nothing more.

- **Differentiability is a property of the pair $(f, A)$ at $c$, not of $f$
  alone.** The restriction clause above goes in one direction only, and the
  converse fails. Take $A := \mathbb{R}$, $f(x) := |x|$, $B := [0,\infty)$ and
  $c := 0$. Then $f|_B$ is the identity on $B$, whose difference quotient at $0$
  is constantly $1$, so $f|_B$ is differentiable at $0$ with derivative $1$;
  that $f$ itself is not differentiable at $0$ is
  [[cex-absolute-value-is-not-differentiable-at-zero]] on the companion page.
  So enlarging the domain can destroy differentiability, and the phrase
  "$f$ is differentiable at $c$" always carries the domain with it.

- **The relation to continuity is not definitional.** [[def-continuity-real]]
  is a condition on $f$ near $c$ that does not mention a quotient, and it is
  defined at every point of $A$, isolated points included, whereas
  differentiability is defined only at limit points of $A$. That
  differentiability implies continuity is a theorem on this page and not a
  reading of the definitions.

- **No second derivative and no one-sided derivative is introduced here.**
  Both are standard, and both are absent from this page on purpose;
  [[rem-derivative-conventions]] records exactly what is fixed and what is left
  open at this point in the reading order.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$, let
$\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Suppose $f$ and $g$ are continuous at
$c$ ([[def-continuity-real]]). Then:

1. $f + g$, $\alpha f$ and $fg$ are continuous at $c$;
2. $|f|$, the function $x \mapsto |f(x)|$, is continuous at $c$;
3. $\max\{f,g\}$ and $\min\{f,g\}$, defined pointwise by
   $x \mapsto \max\{f(x), g(x)\}$ and $x \mapsto \min\{f(x), g(x)\}$
   ([[def-max-min]]), are continuous at $c$;
4. if $g(c) \ne 0$ then, writing $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$, the
   point $c$ lies in $A_0$ and the quotient
   $(f/g)|_{A_0} : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$, $x \mapsto f(x)/g(x)$, is continuous at
   $c$ as a function on $A_0$.

Moreover, with no hypothesis at all:

5. every constant function $A \to \mathbb{R}$ and the identity
   $\mathrm{id} : A \to \mathbb{R}$, $x \mapsto x$, are continuous on $A$; hence
   so is $x \mapsto x^{n}$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$
   ([[def-integer-power]]), and hence so is every **polynomial function**
   $x \mapsto a_0 + a_1 x + \dots + a_n x^{n}$ with real coefficients.

Consequently, if $f$ and $g$ are continuous **on** $A$ then so are $f+g$,
$\alpha f$, $fg$, $|f|$, $\max\{f,g\}$ and $\min\{f,g\}$, and
$(f/g)|_{A_0}$ is continuous on $A_0$.

**Claim 4 is stated on $A_0$ because $f/g$ is not defined where $g$ vanishes**,
and $g$ may well vanish at points of $A$ far from $c$. The hypothesis is
$g(c) \ne 0$, not "$g$ nowhere zero"; what it buys is that $c$ itself lies in
the smaller domain, which is what makes continuity there mean anything.

**Nothing here is proved through a sequence.** Claims 1 and 4 are read off from
[[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]], which is itself proved from $\varepsilon$
and $\delta$, and claims 2, 3 and 5 are proved directly below. So no choice
principle is used anywhere in this item.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, functions $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\alpha$, a point $c \in A$ at which $f$ and $g$ are continuous, and, for claim 4, the hypothesis $g(c) \ne 0$ together with $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$.

[L1] Continuity at $c$: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L2] A point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$, and never both; at an isolated point of its domain every function is continuous; at a limit point $c$ of $A$, continuity of $f$ at $c$ is exactly the statement that the limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and equals $f(c)$ ([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-function-limit]]).

[L3] Algebra of function limits at a limit point $c$ of $A$: if the limits of $f$ and $g$ at $c$ exist with values $L$ and $M$, then the limits of $f+g$, $\alpha f$ and $fg$ at $c$ exist with values $L+M$, $\alpha L$ and $LM$; and if $M \ne 0$ then $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$, and the limit of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$ exists and equals $L/M$ ([[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]]).

[L4] Sign preservation: if the limit of $g$ at a limit point $c$ of $A$ exists and is nonzero, then $c$ is a limit point of $A_0 = \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$ ([[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]]).

[L5] Reverse triangle inequality: $\bigl||u| - |v|\bigr| \le |u - v|$ ([[cor-of-reverse-triangle]]); and $|u| \ge 0$, $|u| = 0$ exactly when $u = 0$, $|uv| = |u||v|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L6] Maximum and minimum of a two-element set of reals exist ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]), and for all reals $u, v$ one has $\max\{u,v\} = \tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(u + v + |u-v|\bigr)$ and $\min\{u,v\} = \tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(u + v - |u-v|\bigr)$.

[L7] Ordered-field arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: trichotomy and totality of the order, the field identities, and $0 < 1$ so that $2 \ne 0$ and $t/2$ is defined ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]).

[L8] Integer powers: $a^{0} = 1$ and $a^{n+1} = a^{n} \cdot a$ ([[def-integer-power]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Justification of the identity in [L6].** Let $u, v \in \mathbb{R}$. By totality either $u \ge v$ or $v \ge u$. If $u \ge v$ then $u - v \ge 0$, so $|u-v| = u-v$ and $\tfrac{1}{2}(u+v+|u-v|) = \tfrac{1}{2}(2u) = u = \max\{u,v\}$, while $\tfrac{1}{2}(u+v-|u-v|) = v = \min\{u,v\}$. If $v \ge u$ the same computation with the roles exchanged applies, since $|u-v| = v-u$ there. [L5, L6, L7]

1.2 **The isolated case.** Suppose $c$ is an isolated point of $A$, say $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ with $\eta > 0$ real. Then every function on $A$ is continuous at $c$ by [L2], which gives claims 1, 2 and 3 at once. For claim 4, assume $g(c) \ne 0$; then $c \in A_0$, and $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A_0 \subseteq N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ with $c$ in the left-hand side, so $c$ is an isolated point of $A_0$ and every function on $A_0$, in particular $(f/g)|_{A_0}$, is continuous at $c$. [L2]

1.3 **Claim 2, at any point of $A$.** Let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given and let $\delta > 0$ be as in [L1] for $f$ and this $\varepsilon$. For $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ the reverse triangle inequality gives $\bigl||f(x)| - |f(c)|\bigr| \le |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$. So $|f|$ is continuous at $c$, and no case distinction was needed. [L1, L5]

1.4 **Claim 5, constants and the identity.** If $f$ is constant then $|f(x) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$ for every $x \in A$ and every real $\varepsilon > 0$, so any $\delta > 0$ serves. For the identity, given a real $\varepsilon > 0$ take $\delta := \varepsilon$: every $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ has $|\mathrm{id}(x) - \mathrm{id}(c)| = |x - c| < \varepsilon$. Both are continuous at every point of $A$. [L1, L5, L7]

1.5 **The limit-point case, claim 1.** Suppose $c$ is a limit point of $A$. By [L2] the limits of $f$ and of $g$ at $c$ exist and equal $f(c)$ and $g(c)$. By [L3] the limits of $f+g$, $\alpha f$ and $fg$ at $c$ exist and equal $f(c)+g(c)$, $\alpha f(c)$ and $f(c)g(c)$, which are exactly the values of those three functions at $c$; by [L2] again, each of them is continuous at $c$. [L2, L3]

1.6 **The limit-point case, claim 4.** Suppose $c$ is a limit point of $A$ and $g(c) \ne 0$. Then $c \in A_0$, and by [L4] the point $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$. By [L3] the limit of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$ exists and equals $f(c)/g(c)$, which is the value of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$; by [L2] applied on the domain $A_0$, that function is continuous at $c$. [L2, L3, L4]

2.1 **Claims 1 and 4 in general.** By [L2] the point $c$ is either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$; step 1.2 settles the first case and steps 1.5 and 1.6 the second. So claims 1 and 4 hold as stated. [step 1.2, step 1.5, step 1.6, L2]

3.1 **Claim 3.** By claim 1 the function $f - g = f + (-1)g$ is continuous at $c$, by step 1.3 so is $|f-g|$, and by claim 1 again so are $f + g + |f-g|$ and its scalar multiple by $1/2$. By step 1.1 that scalar multiple is the function $x \mapsto \max\{f(x), g(x)\}$, so the maximum is continuous at $c$; the same argument with $-|f-g|$ gives the minimum. [step 1.1, step 1.3, step 2.1, L6, L7]

3.2 **Claim 5, powers and polynomials.** The map $x \mapsto x^{0}$ is the constant $1$ and $x \mapsto x^{1}$ is the identity, both continuous on $A$ by step 1.4; and if $x \mapsto x^{n}$ is continuous on $A$ then so is $x \mapsto x^{n+1} = x^{n} \cdot x$, being a product of two functions continuous on $A$ by step 2.1. By induction on $n$, $x \mapsto x^{n}$ is continuous on $A$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. A polynomial function $a_0 + a_1x + \dots + a_nx^{n}$ is obtained from these by finitely many scalar multiplications and additions, each of which preserves continuity by step 2.1. [step 1.4, step 2.1, L8]

4.1 Claims 1 to 5 are proved, all of them at an arbitrary point $c$ of $A$ and therefore, applied at every point, on the whole of $A$; and no sequence and no choice principle was used. [step 1.3, step 2.1, step 3.1, step 3.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the two-case shape, and why it is not an inconvenience.** Continuity is defined at every point of the domain, including isolated points, where no limit exists ([[def-continuity-real]]). The algebra of limits therefore cannot be applied blindly; but at an isolated point every function is continuous, so the case is settled before it is opened. Claims 2 and 5 are proved directly from $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ and need no case distinction at all.

- **Absolute value, maximum and minimum are not in [[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]]**, and the reason is that they are not needed there. They are needed here: the extreme value theorem and the one-dimensional fixed point theorem both build auxiliary functions out of maxima, minima and differences, and [[thm-compactness-is-necessary-for-evt-and-uniform-continuity]] builds its witnesses out of $|x - x_0|$ and quotients.

- **The converse of claim 2 is false**: $|f|$ may be continuous while $f$ is continuous nowhere. The function equal to $1$ on $\mathbb{Q}$ and to $-1$ elsewhere has constant absolute value; that it is nowhere continuous follows from the argument of [[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]] applied verbatim, since that argument uses only that the two values are distinct.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $c \in A$ be a limit point of $A$
([[def-limit-point-r]]), let $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ be differentiable at $c$
([[def-derivative]]) and let $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$. Then:

1. $f + g$ is differentiable at $c$ and $(f+g)'(c) = f'(c) + g'(c)$;
2. $\alpha f$ is differentiable at $c$ and $(\alpha f)'(c) = \alpha f'(c)$;
3. $fg$ is differentiable at $c$ and $(fg)'(c) = f'(c)g(c) + f(c)g'(c)$;
4. if $g(c) \ne 0$ then, writing $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$, the
   point $c$ lies in $A_0$ and is a limit point of $A_0$, the quotient
   $(f/g)|_{A_0} : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$, $x \mapsto f(x)/g(x)$, is differentiable
   at $c$ as a function on $A_0$, and
   $$\bigl((f/g)|_{A_0}\bigr)'(c) \;=\; \frac{f'(c)\,g(c) - f(c)\,g'(c)}{g(c)^{2}} .$$

Each claim asserts two things: that the derivative on the left exists, and that
it has the stated value. Both are proved.

**Why claim 4 is stated on $A_0$.** The function $f/g$ is not defined where $g$
vanishes, and $g$ may vanish at points of $A$ far from $c$; restricting to $A_0$
is forced. That the restriction still has $c$ as a limit point, so that a
derivative there means anything at all, is not free either, and it is the last
claim of [[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]] applied to $g$. The hypothesis
is $g(c) \ne 0$, not "$g$ vanishes nowhere".

**Everything is proved through
[[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]].** No difference quotient is estimated and
no limit theorem beyond continuity is used, so no choice principle is spent.
The four identities are four algebraic rearrangements of an increment, each
followed by a reading of [[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a point $c \in A$ that is a limit point of $A$, functions $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ differentiable at $c$, and a real $\alpha$; for claim 4 also the hypothesis $g(c) \ne 0$ together with $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$ ([[def-derivative]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L1] Carathéodory's characterisation ([[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]]), used in both directions: for a set $B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a point $p \in B$ that is a limit point of $B$ and a function $h : B \to \mathbb{R}$, the function $h$ is differentiable at $p$ if and only if there is $\eta : B \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $p$, with $h(x) - h(p) = \eta(x)(x - p)$ for every $x \in B$, and then $\eta(p) = h'(p)$.

[L2] Algebra of continuous functions ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]]): sums, scalar multiples and products of functions continuous at a point are continuous there (claim 1); every constant function and the identity are continuous everywhere on the domain (claim 5); and if $u, v$ are continuous at a point $p$ of their common domain $D$ with $v(p) \ne 0$, then $p$ lies in $D_0 := \{x \in D : v(x) \ne 0\}$ and $(u/v)|_{D_0}$ is continuous at $p$ as a function on $D_0$ (claim 4).

[L3] Continuity passes to a subset of the domain: if $B \subseteq A$, if $p \in B$ and if $\psi : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $p$, then $\psi|_B$ is continuous at $p$, the condition on the restriction quantifying over fewer points ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L4] A function differentiable at $c$ is continuous at $c$ ([[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]]); in particular $g$ is.

[L5] At a limit point $c$ of $A$, continuity of $g$ at $c$ says exactly that $\lim_{x \to c} g(x)$ exists and equals $g(c)$ ([[def-continuity-real]], clause 1, [[def-function-limit]]).

[L6] Sign preservation ([[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]]): if $c$ is a limit point of $A$ and $\lim_{x \to c} g(x)$ exists and is nonzero, then $c$ is a limit point of $A_0 = \{x \in A : g(x) \ne 0\}$.

[L7] A product of two nonzero reals is nonzero ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]), and $g(c)^{2} = g(c)\,g(c)$ ([[def-integer-power]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L1], applied to $f$ and to $g$ on $A$ at $c$, fix $\varphi, \psi : A \to \mathbb{R}$, both continuous at $c$, with $f(x) - f(c) = \varphi(x)(x - c)$ and $g(x) - g(c) = \psi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in A$, and with $\varphi(c) = f'(c)$ and $\psi(c) = g'(c)$. [L1, choose]

1.2 Assume $g(c) \ne 0$. Then $c \in A_0$ by the definition of $A_0$; $g$ is continuous at $c$ by [L4], so $\lim_{x \to c} g(x) = g(c) \ne 0$ by [L5]; and therefore $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$ by [L6]. [L4, L5, L6]

2.1 **Sum.** For every $x \in A$, $(f+g)(x) - (f+g)(c) = \bigl(f(x)-f(c)\bigr) + \bigl(g(x)-g(c)\bigr) = \bigl(\varphi(x) + \psi(x)\bigr)(x-c)$. The function $\varphi + \psi$ is continuous at $c$ by [L2], and $(\varphi+\psi)(c) = f'(c) + g'(c)$. So [L1] gives claim 1. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.2 **Scalar multiple.** For every $x \in A$, $(\alpha f)(x) - (\alpha f)(c) = \alpha\bigl(f(x)-f(c)\bigr) = \bigl(\alpha\varphi(x)\bigr)(x-c)$. The function $\alpha\varphi$ is continuous at $c$ by [L2], with value $\alpha f'(c)$ there. So [L1] gives claim 2. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.3 **Product.** For every $x \in A$, $f(x)g(x) - f(c)g(c) = \bigl(f(x)-f(c)\bigr)g(x) + f(c)\bigl(g(x)-g(c)\bigr) = \bigl(\varphi(x)g(x) + f(c)\psi(x)\bigr)(x-c)$. Put $\chi := \varphi\,g + f(c)\,\psi$; it is continuous at $c$ by [L2], since $\varphi$, $\psi$ and (by [L4]) $g$ are, and constants are; and $\chi(c) = \varphi(c)g(c) + f(c)\psi(c) = f'(c)g(c) + f(c)g'(c)$. So [L1] gives claim 3. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L4]

2.4 **Quotient, the rearrangement.** Assume $g(c) \ne 0$ and let $x \in A_0$, so $g(x) \ne 0$ and $g(c) \ne 0$. Then $f(x)/g(x) - f(c)/g(c) = \bigl(f(x)g(c) - f(c)g(x)\bigr)/\bigl(g(x)g(c)\bigr)$, and $f(x)g(c) - f(c)g(x) = \bigl(f(x)-f(c)\bigr)g(c) - f(c)\bigl(g(x)-g(c)\bigr) = \bigl(\varphi(x)g(c) - f(c)\psi(x)\bigr)(x-c)$. So, defining $\theta : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$ by $\theta(x) := \bigl(\varphi(x)g(c) - f(c)\psi(x)\bigr)/\bigl(g(x)g(c)\bigr)$, one has $(f/g)|_{A_0}(x) - (f/g)|_{A_0}(c) = \theta(x)(x-c)$ for every $x \in A_0$. [step 1.1, L1, L7]

2.5 **Quotient, continuity of the factor.** Assume $g(c) \ne 0$. The restrictions of $\varphi$, $\psi$ and $g$ to $A_0$ are continuous at $c \in A_0$ by [L3] and [L4], so by [L2] the numerator $u(x) := \varphi(x)g(c) - f(c)\psi(x)$ and the denominator $v(x) := g(x)g(c)$ are continuous at $c$ as functions on $A_0$. By [L7] the denominator vanishes at no point of $A_0$, so $\{x \in A_0 : v(x) \ne 0\} = A_0$, and $v(c) = g(c)^{2} \ne 0$; hence claim 4 of [L2] gives that $\theta = (u/v)|_{A_0}$ is continuous at $c$, with $\theta(c) = \bigl(\varphi(c)g(c) - f(c)\psi(c)\bigr)/g(c)^{2} = \bigl(f'(c)g(c) - f(c)g'(c)\bigr)/g(c)^{2}$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L2, L3, L4, L7]

3.1 **Quotient, conclusion.** Assume $g(c) \ne 0$. By step 1.2 the point $c$ lies in $A_0$ and is a limit point of $A_0$; by steps 2.4 and 2.5 the function $\theta : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$ and factors the increment of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$. So [L1], applied on the domain $A_0$ at the point $c$, gives that $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ is differentiable at $c$ with derivative $\theta(c)$: claim 4. [step 1.2, step 2.4, step 2.5, L1]

4.1 Claims 1 to 4 are proved, by steps 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 3.1 respectively, each by exhibiting the Carathéodory factor of the new function and reading its continuity at $c$ off the algebra of continuous functions. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The product rearrangement in one line.** The identity $fg - f(c)g(c) = (f - f(c))\,g + f(c)\,(g - g(c))$ splits the increment of a product into two increments, one multiplied by $g$ and one by a constant. It is the same identity that carries the product case of [[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]], read at the level of increments rather than of $\varepsilon$; here the factor $g$ has to be continuous at $c$ rather than merely bounded near it, and [[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]] is what supplies that.

- **The reciprocal is the case $f \equiv 1$.** Claim 4 then reads $\bigl((1/g)|_{A_0}\bigr)'(c) = -g'(c)/g(c)^{2}$, since $f'(c) = 0$ for a constant $f$; nothing separate has to be proved, and the derivative of a negative integer power on this page is obtained exactly this way.

- **Two hypotheses that look removable and are not.** In claim 4 the hypothesis $g(c) \ne 0$ cannot be weakened to "$g$ is nonzero somewhere near $c$", because $c$ itself must lie in the smaller domain for a derivative there to be a statement about $c$; and the conclusion is about $(f/g)|_{A_0}$, not about any extension of it to $A$, since no such extension is canonical.

## Statement

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be
continuous on $[a,b]$ ([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-interval]]) and
differentiable at every point of $(a,b)$ as a function on $[a,b]$
([[def-derivative]]), and suppose

$$f(a) \;=\; f(b) .$$

Then there is $c \in (a,b)$ with $f'(c) = 0$.

**Three hypotheses, three different jobs.** Continuity on the **closed**
interval is what the extreme value theorem consumes; differentiability on the
**open** interval is what Fermat's theorem consumes, and it is asked for
nowhere else; and $f(a) = f(b)$ is what forces the extremum inside when neither
extremum is attained in the interior. Continuity at the two endpoints cannot be
dropped, and a false statement later on this page records a witness for that.

**Differentiability is meant with respect to the domain $[a,b]$.** For $c$ in
the open interval that is the same condition as differentiability of any
restriction of $f$ to a subinterval around $c$, since only points near $c$
enter, but the phrase is fixed here so that the citation of
[[thm-fermat-interior-extremum]], whose hypothesis is interiority in the
domain, is exact.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, a function $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable at every point of $(a,b)$, with $f(a) = f(b)$.

[L1] $[a,b]$ is closed ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) and bounded ([[def-interval]], [[def-bounded-set]]), hence compact ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]]); and it is nonempty, since $a \le a \le b$ gives $a \in [a,b]$.

[L2] Extreme value theorem ([[thm-extreme-value-r]]): for $f$ continuous on $A$ and $K \subseteq A$ nonempty and compact there are $p, q \in K$ with $f(q) \le f(x) \le f(p)$ for every $x \in K$, so that $f(p) = \max f[K]$ and $f(q) = \min f[K]$ ([[def-max-min]]).

[L3] Every point of $(a,b)$ is interior to $[a,b]$: for $c$ with $a < c < b$ put $\varepsilon := \min\{c - a,\ b - c\}$, a positive real; every $y$ with $|y - c| < \varepsilon$ satisfies $y > c - \varepsilon \ge a$ and $y < c + \varepsilon \le b$, so $N_{\varepsilon}(c) \subseteq (a,b) \subseteq [a,b]$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-interval]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]).

[L4] A value $f(c)$ that is a greatest value of $f$ over the whole of its domain is a local maximum at $c$, and a least value is a local minimum at $c$ ([[def-local-extremum]], claim 4 of its body).

[L5] Fermat's interior extremum theorem ([[thm-fermat-interior-extremum]]): a local extremum at a point interior to the domain, at which the function is differentiable, forces the derivative there to vanish.

[L6] $(a,b)$ is nonempty when $a < b$, since $a < (a+b)/2 < b$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L7] A constant function $h$ on $[a,b]$ is differentiable at every point $c$ of $[a,b]$ with $h'(c) = 0$: every point of the nondegenerate order-convex set $[a,b]$ is a limit point of it, and the difference quotient of $h$ at $c$ is the constant $0$ on $[a,b] \setminus \{c\}$, whose limit at $c$ is $0$ ([[def-derivative]], [[def-function-limit]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The set $[a,b]$ is nonempty and compact, and $f$ is continuous on it. [L1]

1.2 Since $a < b$, the open interval $(a,b)$ is nonempty; fix $m := (a+b)/2 \in (a,b)$. [L6, choose]

2.1 By [L2], applied with $A := K := [a,b]$, fix $p, q \in [a,b]$ with $f(q) \le f(x) \le f(p)$ for every $x \in [a,b]$. [step 1.1, L2, choose]

3.1 **Case A: at least one of $p, q$ lies in $(a,b)$.** Fix such a point and call it $c$. By [L3] the point $c$ is interior to $[a,b]$, and $f$ is differentiable at $c$ because $c \in (a,b)$. By step 2.1 and [L4], $f$ has a local maximum at $c$ if $c$ is the point $p$, and a local minimum at $c$ if it is the point $q$; either way a local extremum. So [L5] gives $f'(c) = 0$, and $c \in (a,b)$. [step 2.1, L3, L4, L5]

3.2 **Case B: neither $p$ nor $q$ lies in $(a,b)$.** A point of $[a,b]$ outside $(a,b)$ satisfies $a \le x \le b$ and not $a < x < b$, hence equals $a$ or $b$; so $p, q \in \{a, b\}$ and, since $f(a) = f(b)$, both $f(p)$ and $f(q)$ equal $f(a)$. By step 2.1, every $x \in [a,b]$ satisfies $f(a) = f(q) \le f(x) \le f(p) = f(a)$, so $f(x) = f(a)$. Thus $f$ is the constant function with value $f(a)$ on $[a,b]$. [step 2.1]

4.1 In case B, [L7] gives that $f$ is differentiable at every point of $[a,b]$ with derivative $0$; in particular $f'(m) = 0$, and $m \in (a,b)$ by step 1.2. [step 1.2, step 3.2, L7]

5.1 The two cases are exhaustive, since either at least one of $p, q$ lies in $(a,b)$ or neither does. Case A supplies a point $c \in (a,b)$ with $f'(c) = 0$ by step 3.1, and case B supplies the point $m$ by step 4.1. [step 3.1, step 4.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The constant case is not a degenerate nuisance, it is the case where the extremum sits on the boundary.** When $f$ is constant the greatest and least values are attained at the endpoints as well as everywhere else, so nothing forces the extreme value theorem to hand back an interior point; the argument has to produce a point of $(a,b)$ by hand, and any point will do.

- **Why compactness enters at all.** Only through [[thm-extreme-value-r]], and only to know that the greatest and least values are **attained**. A supremum that is not attained is useless here: Fermat's theorem is a statement about a point, not about a bound. That is precisely the hypothesis the companion page's witness removes.

- **Nothing is claimed about how many such $c$ there are, or where.** A single $c$ is produced, and the proof gives no way to locate it; the theorem is an existence statement and is used only as one.
