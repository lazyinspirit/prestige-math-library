## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` proof, actively search for a counterexample. A false
public claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or
materially inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is
nonfatal.

Return no more than 450 words, exactly in this shape:

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $c \in A$ be a limit point of $A$
([[def-limit-point-r]]), let $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ be differentiable at $c$
([[def-derivative]]) and let $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$. Then:

1. $f + g$ is differentiable at $c$ and $(f+g)'(c) = f'(c) + g'(c)$;
2. $\alpha f$ is differentiable at $c$ and $(\alpha f)'(c) = \alpha f'(c)$;
3. $fg$ is differentiable at $c$ and $(fg)'(c) = f'(c)g(c) + f(c)g'(c)$;
4. if $g(c) \ne 0$ then, writing $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$, the
   point $c$ lies in $A_0$ and is a limit point of $A_0$, the quotient
   $(f/g)|_{A_0} : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$, $x \mapsto f(x)/g(x)$, is differentiable
   at $c$ as a function on $A_0$, and
   $$\bigl((f/g)|_{A_0}\bigr)'(c) \;=\; \frac{f'(c)\,g(c) - f(c)\,g'(c)}{g(c)^{2}} .$$

Each claim asserts two things: that the derivative on the left exists, and that
it has the stated value. Both are proved.

**Why claim 4 is stated on $A_0$.** The function $f/g$ is not defined where $g$
vanishes, and $g$ may vanish at points of $A$ far from $c$; restricting to $A_0$
is forced. That the restriction still has $c$ as a limit point, so that a
derivative there means anything at all, is not free either, and it is the last
claim of [[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]] applied to $g$. The hypothesis
is $g(c) \ne 0$, not "$g$ vanishes nowhere".

**Everything is proved through
[[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]].** No difference quotient is estimated and
no limit theorem beyond continuity is used, so no choice principle is spent.
The four identities are four algebraic rearrangements of an increment, each
followed by a reading of [[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a point $c \in A$ that is a limit point of $A$, functions $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ differentiable at $c$, and a real $\alpha$; for claim 4 also the hypothesis $g(c) \ne 0$ together with $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$ ([[def-derivative]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L1] Carathéodory's characterisation ([[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]]), used in both directions: for a set $B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a point $p \in B$ that is a limit point of $B$ and a function $h : B \to \mathbb{R}$, the function $h$ is differentiable at $p$ if and only if there is $\eta : B \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $p$, with $h(x) - h(p) = \eta(x)(x - p)$ for every $x \in B$, and then $\eta(p) = h'(p)$.

[L2] Algebra of continuous functions ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]]): sums, scalar multiples and products of functions continuous at a point are continuous there (claim 1); every constant function and the identity are continuous everywhere on the domain (claim 5); and if $u, v$ are continuous at a point $p$ of their common domain $D$ with $v(p) \ne 0$, then $p$ lies in $D_0 := \{x \in D : v(x) \ne 0\}$ and $(u/v)|_{D_0}$ is continuous at $p$ as a function on $D_0$ (claim 4).

[L3] Continuity passes to a subset of the domain: if $B \subseteq A$, if $p \in B$ and if $\psi : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $p$, then $\psi|_B$ is continuous at $p$, the condition on the restriction quantifying over fewer points ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L4] A function differentiable at $c$ is continuous at $c$ ([[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]]); in particular $g$ is.

[L5] At a limit point $c$ of $A$, continuity of $g$ at $c$ says exactly that $\lim_{x \to c} g(x)$ exists and equals $g(c)$ ([[def-continuity-real]], clause 1, [[def-function-limit]]).

[L6] Sign preservation ([[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]]): if $c$ is a limit point of $A$ and $\lim_{x \to c} g(x)$ exists and is nonzero, then $c$ is a limit point of $A_0 = \{x \in A : g(x) \ne 0\}$.

[L7] A product of two nonzero reals is nonzero ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]), and $g(c)^{2} = g(c)\,g(c)$ ([[def-integer-power]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L1], applied to $f$ and to $g$ on $A$ at $c$, fix $\varphi, \psi : A \to \mathbb{R}$, both continuous at $c$, with $f(x) - f(c) = \varphi(x)(x - c)$ and $g(x) - g(c) = \psi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in A$, and with $\varphi(c) = f'(c)$ and $\psi(c) = g'(c)$. [L1, choose]

1.2 Assume $g(c) \ne 0$. Then $c \in A_0$ by the definition of $A_0$; $g$ is continuous at $c$ by [L4], so $\lim_{x \to c} g(x) = g(c) \ne 0$ by [L5]; and therefore $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$ by [L6]. [L4, L5, L6]

2.1 **Sum.** For every $x \in A$, $(f+g)(x) - (f+g)(c) = \bigl(f(x)-f(c)\bigr) + \bigl(g(x)-g(c)\bigr) = \bigl(\varphi(x) + \psi(x)\bigr)(x-c)$. The function $\varphi + \psi$ is continuous at $c$ by [L2], and $(\varphi+\psi)(c) = f'(c) + g'(c)$. So [L1] gives claim 1. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.2 **Scalar multiple.** For every $x \in A$, $(\alpha f)(x) - (\alpha f)(c) = \alpha\bigl(f(x)-f(c)\bigr) = \bigl(\alpha\varphi(x)\bigr)(x-c)$. The function $\alpha\varphi$ is continuous at $c$ by [L2], with value $\alpha f'(c)$ there. So [L1] gives claim 2. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.3 **Product.** For every $x \in A$, $f(x)g(x) - f(c)g(c) = \bigl(f(x)-f(c)\bigr)g(x) + f(c)\bigl(g(x)-g(c)\bigr) = \bigl(\varphi(x)g(x) + f(c)\psi(x)\bigr)(x-c)$. Put $\chi := \varphi\,g + f(c)\,\psi$; it is continuous at $c$ by [L2], since $\varphi$, $\psi$ and (by [L4]) $g$ are, and constants are; and $\chi(c) = \varphi(c)g(c) + f(c)\psi(c) = f'(c)g(c) + f(c)g'(c)$. So [L1] gives claim 3. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L4]

2.4 **Quotient, the rearrangement.** Assume $g(c) \ne 0$ and let $x \in A_0$, so $g(x) \ne 0$ and $g(c) \ne 0$. Then $f(x)/g(x) - f(c)/g(c) = \bigl(f(x)g(c) - f(c)g(x)\bigr)/\bigl(g(x)g(c)\bigr)$, and $f(x)g(c) - f(c)g(x) = \bigl(f(x)-f(c)\bigr)g(c) - f(c)\bigl(g(x)-g(c)\bigr) = \bigl(\varphi(x)g(c) - f(c)\psi(x)\bigr)(x-c)$. So, defining $\theta : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$ by $\theta(x) := \bigl(\varphi(x)g(c) - f(c)\psi(x)\bigr)/\bigl(g(x)g(c)\bigr)$, one has $(f/g)|_{A_0}(x) - (f/g)|_{A_0}(c) = \theta(x)(x-c)$ for every $x \in A_0$. [step 1.1, L1, L7]

2.5 **Quotient, continuity of the factor.** Assume $g(c) \ne 0$. The restrictions of $\varphi$, $\psi$ and $g$ to $A_0$ are continuous at $c \in A_0$ by [L3] and [L4], so by [L2] the numerator $u(x) := \varphi(x)g(c) - f(c)\psi(x)$ and the denominator $v(x) := g(x)g(c)$ are continuous at $c$ as functions on $A_0$. By [L7] the denominator vanishes at no point of $A_0$, so $\{x \in A_0 : v(x) \ne 0\} = A_0$, and $v(c) = g(c)^{2} \ne 0$; hence claim 4 of [L2] gives that $\theta = (u/v)|_{A_0}$ is continuous at $c$, with $\theta(c) = \bigl(\varphi(c)g(c) - f(c)\psi(c)\bigr)/g(c)^{2} = \bigl(f'(c)g(c) - f(c)g'(c)\bigr)/g(c)^{2}$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L2, L3, L4, L7]

3.1 **Quotient, conclusion.** Assume $g(c) \ne 0$. By step 1.2 the point $c$ lies in $A_0$ and is a limit point of $A_0$; by steps 2.4 and 2.5 the function $\theta : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$ and factors the increment of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$. So [L1], applied on the domain $A_0$ at the point $c$, gives that $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ is differentiable at $c$ with derivative $\theta(c)$: claim 4. [step 1.2, step 2.4, step 2.5, L1]

4.1 Claims 1 to 4 are proved, by steps 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 3.1 respectively, each by exhibiting the Carathéodory factor of the new function and reading its continuity at $c$ off the algebra of continuous functions. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The product rearrangement in one line.** The identity $fg - f(c)g(c) = (f - f(c))\,g + f(c)\,(g - g(c))$ splits the increment of a product into two increments, one multiplied by $g$ and one by a constant. It is the same identity that carries the product case of [[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]], read at the level of increments rather than of $\varepsilon$; here the factor $g$ has to be continuous at $c$ rather than merely bounded near it, and [[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]] is what supplies that.

- **The reciprocal is the case $f \equiv 1$.** Claim 4 then reads $\bigl((1/g)|_{A_0}\bigr)'(c) = -g'(c)/g(c)^{2}$, since $f'(c) = 0$ for a constant $f$; nothing separate has to be proved, and the derivative of a negative integer power on this page is obtained exactly this way.

- **Two hypotheses that look removable and are not.** In claim 4 the hypothesis $g(c) \ne 0$ cannot be weakened to "$g$ is nonzero somewhere near $c$", because $c$ itself must lie in the smaller domain for a derivative there to be a statement about $c$; and the conclusion is about $(f/g)|_{A_0}$, not about any extension of it to $A$, since no such extension is canonical.

So allowing $x = c$ costs nothing, and it is what lets the definition\nbe stated at every point of $A$, including the points where no limit exists.\n\n**Three clauses, and all three are part of the definition.**\n\n1. **At a limit point.** Suppose $c \\in A$ is a limit point of $A$\n   ([[def-limit-point-r]]). Then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if the\n   limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and\n   $$\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) \\;=\\; f(c)$$\n   ([[def-function-limit]]).

Then **every** $f : A \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$: take\n   $\\delta := \\eta$, so that the only $x \\in A$ with $|x - c| < \\delta$ is $c$\n   itself, and $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \\varepsilon$.\n\n3. **On a set.** Continuity on $A$ is continuity at each point of $A$, and\n   nothing more. It is not a condition relating $f$ to points outside $A$.\n\nEvery point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$,\nand never both ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so clauses 1 and 2 between them describe\ncontinuity at every point of $A$.\n\n**This is not the raw $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ formula of\n[[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]].** That item records what goes\nwrong when the *punctured* formula of [[def-function-limit]] is written down at\nan arbitrary point of the domain: at an isolated point it is satisfied\nvacuously by every real $L$ at once, so it defines nothing, and this library\ntherefore leaves $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x)$ **undefined** at an isolated point.\nContinuity at an isolated point is a different matter: the formula above is not\nvacuous — it is a genuine condition on $f(c)$, satisfied because $f(c)$ is the\nonly value being compared with itself — and it names a single, well-defined\nproperty. The limit is undefined there; the continuity is defined, and is\nautomatic. Clause 1 is the only place where the two notions meet, and it is\nstated only where the limit exists as a notion.\n\n**Where the distinction disappears.** If $A$ is an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}$\n([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), then every $c \\in A$ has some\n$N_{\\eta}(c) \\subseteq A$, and a punctured neighbourhood is never empty\n([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), so every point of $A$ is a limit point of $A$ and\nclause 1 covers the whole of $A$.

Equality of the limit with the value is an\n   extra condition, not a consequence: [[fs-limit-equals-value]].\n\n**The notation presumes uniqueness.** Writing $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = L$ treats\nthe left-hand side as a name for a single real number, which is legitimate only\nbecause at a limit point at most one $L$ can satisfy the displayed condition.\nThat obligation is discharged by [[lem-function-limit-unique]], recorded in this\nitem's `justified_by`.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$ be a
limit point of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]). If $f$ is differentiable at $c$
([[def-derivative]]) then $f$ is continuous at $c$ ([[def-continuity-real]]).

Consequently, if $f$ is differentiable on a set $S \subseteq A$ then $f$ is
continuous at every point of $S$.

**No converse is asserted, and none holds.** Continuity at $c$ does not give
differentiability at $c$, and the standard witness is worked out on the
companion page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and a point $c \in A$ that is a limit point of $A$ at which $f$ is differentiable ([[def-derivative]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L1] Carathéodory's characterisation ([[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]]): since $f$ is differentiable at the limit point $c$ of $A$, there is $\varphi : A \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $c$, with $f(x) - f(c) = \varphi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in A$, and $\varphi(c) = f'(c)$.

[L2] Algebra of continuous functions ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]]): sums, scalar multiples and products of functions continuous at a point of the common domain are continuous there (claim 1); and every constant function on $A$ and the identity $x \mapsto x$ on $A$ are continuous at every point of $A$ (claim 5).

[L3] Continuity of $f$ at $c$ is the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ condition of [[def-continuity-real]], and continuity on a set is continuity at each of its points.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Fix a function $\varphi : A \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $c$, with $f(x) - f(c) = \varphi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in A$. [L1, choose]

1.2 The identity $x \mapsto x$ on $A$ and every constant function on $A$ are continuous at $c$; hence so is $x \mapsto x - c$, which is the sum of the identity and the constant function with value $-c$. [L2]

2.1 The pointwise product $x \mapsto \varphi(x)(x - c)$ is continuous at $c$, being the product of two functions on $A$ continuous at $c$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L2]

3.1 For every $x \in A$ one has $f(x) = f(c) + \varphi(x)(x - c)$, so $f$ is the sum of the constant function with value $f(c)$ and the product of step 2.1. [step 1.1, L1]

4.1 A sum of two functions continuous at $c$ is continuous at $c$, so $f$ is continuous at $c$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L2, L3]

5.1 The point $c$ was an arbitrary point of $A$, a limit point of $A$, at which $f$ is differentiable; applying step 4.1 at every point of a set $S \subseteq A$ on which $f$ is differentiable gives continuity of $f$ at every point of $S$. [step 3.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the work actually is.** None of it is here. Carathéodory's characterisation already replaces the quotient by a product, and a product is visibly small when one factor is bounded near $c$ and the other tends to $0$; the algebra of continuous functions packages exactly that. A direct proof from the quotient would multiply and divide by $x - c$ and would have to say why that is legal, which is the same observation in a less convenient place.

- **The converse fails.** $x \mapsto |x|$ is continuous at $0$ and not differentiable there, which is [[cex-absolute-value-is-not-differentiable-at-zero]] on the companion page. So continuity is strictly weaker, and the gap is not exotic: it opens at a single corner.

- **What is *not* claimed.** Nothing here says that a function differentiable on a set has a continuous derivative, and nothing here says that $f'$ is defined anywhere except where it was assumed to be. Both are separate questions, and neither is settled on this page.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field with its order and
absolute value ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]), and
neighbourhoods are those of [[def-neighbourhood-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Then
$f$ is **continuous at $c$** when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

with $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ ranging over the **positive reals**. In the
language of neighbourhoods: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ with

$$f\bigl(A \cap N_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \;\subseteq\; N_{\varepsilon}\bigl(f(c)\bigr).$$

$f$ is **continuous on $A$** when it is continuous at every point of $A$.

**The point $c$ is required to lie in $A$, and the condition is unpunctured.**
Both differ from [[def-function-limit]], and deliberately. There the quantifier
runs over $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, which removes $x = c$; here $x = c$ is allowed,
and at $x = c$ the implication reads $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$, which is
automatic. So allowing $x = c$ costs nothing, and it is what lets the definition
be stated at every point of $A$, including the points where no limit exists.

**Three clauses, and all three are part of the definition.**

1. **At a limit point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is a limit point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]). Then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if the
   limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) \;=\; f(c)$$
   ([[def-function-limit]]). Indeed, for a given $\varepsilon > 0$ a $\delta$
   witnessing continuity witnesses the limit condition, because the limit
   condition quantifies over a subset of the points continuity quantifies over;
   and conversely a $\delta$ witnessing $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$ witnesses
   continuity, because the one point it omits, $x = c$, satisfies
   $|f(c) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ anyway.

2. **At an isolated point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is an isolated point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so that $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ for some real
   $\eta > 0$. Then **every** $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$: take
   $\delta := \eta$, so that the only $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ is $c$
   itself, and $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$.

3. **On a set.** Continuity on $A$ is continuity at each point of $A$, and
   nothing more. It is not a condition relating $f$ to points outside $A$.

Every point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$,
and never both ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so clauses 1 and 2 between them describe
continuity at every point of $A$.

**This is not the raw $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula of
[[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]].** That item records what goes
wrong when the *punctured* formula of [[def-function-limit]] is written down at
an arbitrary point of the domain: at an isolated point it is satisfied
vacuously by every real $L$ at once, so it defines nothing, and this library
therefore leaves $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ **undefined** at an isolated point.
Continuity at an isolated point is a different matter: the formula above is not
vacuous — it is a genuine condition on $f(c)$, satisfied because $f(c)$ is the
only value being compared with itself — and it names a single, well-defined
property. The limit is undefined there; the continuity is defined, and is
automatic. Clause 1 is the only place where the two notions meet, and it is
stated only where the limit exists as a notion.

**Where the distinction disappears.** If $A$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), then every $c \in A$ has some
$N_{\eta}(c) \subseteq A$, and a punctured neighbourhood is never empty
([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), so every point of $A$ is a limit point of $A$ and
clause 1 covers the whole of $A$. The same holds when $A$ is a nondegenerate
interval ([[def-interval]]). Isolated points are what force clause 2 to exist at
all, and they occur as soon as $A$ is allowed to be an arbitrary subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, as in $A = \{0\} \cup [1,2]$.

## Remarks

- **Continuity is local.** If $\eta > 0$ and $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agrees with
  $f$ on $A \cap N_{\eta}(c)$, then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if $g$
  is: any $\delta$ may be replaced by $\min\{\delta, \eta\}$, after which the
  condition only ever evaluates the two functions where they agree. So
  continuity at $c$ sees only an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of $c$, exactly
  as the limit does ([[lem-limit-is-local]]).

- **Continuity passes to subsets of the domain.** If $B \subseteq A$ and
  $c \in B$, then continuity of $f$ at $c$ gives continuity of the restriction
  $f|_B$ at $c$, with the same $\delta$: the condition on $f|_B$ quantifies over
  fewer points. The converse fails, and the standard witness is the indicator of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ restricted to $\mathbb{Q}$, which is constant and hence
  continuous, while the indicator itself is continuous nowhere
  ([[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]]).

- **The radius is a real number.** As in [[def-neighbourhood-r]], $\varepsilon$
  and $\delta$ range over the positive reals here. Restricting either quantifier
  to the positive rationals defines the same relation, by the passage recorded
  in [[def-function-limit]]: below every positive real lies a positive rational
  ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and a real $\delta$ may be shrunk to a rational
  one below it.

- **The word *continuous* is used for two things in this library, and they
  agree.** [[def-metric-continuity]] defines continuity of a map between metric
  spaces, and $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ carries the metric $d(x,y) = |x-y|$. The
  two notions coincide, and that is proved, not assumed:
  [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]] is the dictionary, and it is stated on
  this page precisely so that no later item has to guess.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), neighbourhoods are those of
[[def-neighbourhood-r]] and limit points those of [[def-limit-point-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$ be a
**limit point of $A$**. The **difference quotient of $f$ at $c$** is the function

$$q_{f,c} : A \setminus \{c\} \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad q_{f,c}(x) := \frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c} .$$

The division is legitimate at every point of the domain, since $x \ne c$ gives
$x - c \ne 0$.

**The point $c$ is a limit point of $A \setminus \{c\}$, not merely of $A$.**
For every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the punctured neighbourhood
$N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c)$ omits $c$, so

$$N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c) \cap A \;=\; N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c) \cap (A \setminus \{c\}) ,$$

and the left-hand side is nonempty because $c$ is a limit point of $A$. So
$q_{f,c}$ is a function on a set having $c$ as a limit point, and
$\lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x)$ is a notion that [[def-function-limit]] defines.

$f$ is **differentiable at $c$** when that limit exists, and then the
**derivative of $f$ at $c$** is

$$f'(c) \;:=\; \lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x) \;=\; \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c} .$$

**Two obligations are carried by that notation, and both are discharged here.**

1. **Uniqueness.** Writing $f'(c)$ treats the right-hand side as a name for a
   single real number. That is legitimate: $c$ is a limit point of the domain
   $A \setminus \{c\}$ of $q_{f,c}$, so at most one real can satisfy the
   $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ condition, by [[lem-function-limit-unique]] applied to
   $q_{f,c}$. Two reals both meeting the condition are therefore equal, and the
   symbol denotes.
2. **Meaningfulness.** The hypothesis that $c$ is a limit point of $A$ is not
   decoration. At an **isolated** point of $A$ the punctured condition
   $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ is met by no point of the domain at all, so the
   $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula is satisfied vacuously by *every* real at
   once; this is why [[def-function-limit]] leaves the limit undefined there,
   and it is why this library defines $f'(c)$ only at a limit point of $A$. At
   an isolated point of its domain a function is neither differentiable nor
   non-differentiable here: the question is not posed.

**The limit sees only $A \setminus \{c\}$, so how the difference quotient is
extended to $c$ is irrelevant.** Let $Q : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agree with
$q_{f,c}$ at every point of $A \setminus \{c\}$, and let $L \in \mathbb{R}$.
Then $\lim_{x \to c} Q(x) = L$ if and only if $\lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x) = L$.
Both conditions read: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ such that every point $x$ of the relevant domain with
$0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|{\cdot} - L| < \varepsilon$
([[def-function-limit]]). The clause $0 < |x - c|$ removes $x = c$ from both
quantifiers, so in both cases the points quantified over are exactly the
$x \in A \setminus \{c\}$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, at which $Q$ and
$q_{f,c}$ take the same value. The two conditions are the same condition.

**Differentiability on a set.** For $S \subseteq A$, $f$ is **differentiable on
$S$** when it is differentiable at every $c \in S$; implicit in that phrase is
that every point of $S$ is a limit point of $A$. $f$ is **differentiable** when
it is differentiable on the whole of $A$.

**Restriction of the domain.** Let $B \subseteq A$, let $c \in B$ and suppose
$c$ is a limit point of $B$. If $f$ is differentiable at $c$, then so is the
restriction $f|_B : B \to \mathbb{R}$, and

$$(f|_B)'(c) \;=\; f'(c) .$$

Indeed $B \setminus \{c\} \subseteq A \setminus \{c\}$; the displayed identity
of punctured neighbourhoods above, applied to $B$, shows that $c$ is a limit
point of $B \setminus \{c\}$; the difference quotient $q_{f|_B, c}$ is the
restriction of $q_{f,c}$ to $B \setminus \{c\}$, since $f|_B(c) = f(c)$; and
claim 2 of [[lem-limit-is-local]] carries the limit to that restriction.

**Every point of a nondegenerate interval is a limit point of it.** Let
$J \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be order-convex ([[def-interval]]) with at least two
elements and let $p \in J$. Choose $q \in J$ with $q \ne p$, and let a real
$\varepsilon > 0$ be given. If $p < q$, put $y := p + \tfrac{1}{2}\min\{\varepsilon,\ q - p\}$;
then $p < y$, and $y - p \le \tfrac{1}{2}(q-p) < q - p$, so $p < y < q$ and
order-convexity gives $y \in J$, while $0 < |y - p| < \varepsilon$. If $q < p$,
the point $y := p - \tfrac{1}{2}\min\{\varepsilon,\ p - q\}$ serves in the same
way. So $N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(p) \cap J \ne \varnothing$ for every real
$\varepsilon > 0$, that is, $p$ is a limit point of $J$
([[def-limit-point-r]]).

Consequently, for $f$ defined on a nondegenerate interval $I$, the symbol
$f'(c)$ is meaningful at **every** $c \in I$, endpoints included. At an endpoint
the difference quotient is taken over the points of $I$ lying on the one side
that is available, so what other texts call a one-sided derivative is, here,
simply the derivative of $f$ on $I$.

## Remarks

- **Notation.** $f'(c)$ and $\frac{df}{dx}(c)$ denote the same real number, and
  this library uses the first. Neither is an operation performed on a symbol
  $x$: the variable in the second is a name for the argument and nothing more.

- **Differentiability is a property of the pair $(f, A)$ at $c$, not of $f$
  alone.** The restriction clause above goes in one direction only, and the
  converse fails. Take $A := \mathbb{R}$, $f(x) := |x|$, $B := [0,\infty)$ and
  $c := 0$. Then $f|_B$ is the identity on $B$, whose difference quotient at $0$
  is constantly $1$, so $f|_B$ is differentiable at $0$ with derivative $1$;
  that $f$ itself is not differentiable at $0$ is
  [[cex-absolute-value-is-not-differentiable-at-zero]] on the companion page.
  So enlarging the domain can destroy differentiability, and the phrase
  "$f$ is differentiable at $c$" always carries the domain with it.

- **The relation to continuity is not definitional.** [[def-continuity-real]]
  is a condition on $f$ near $c$ that does not mention a quotient, and it is
  defined at every point of $A$, isolated points included, whereas
  differentiability is defined only at limit points of $A$. That
  differentiability implies continuity is a theorem on this page and not a
  reading of the definitions.

- **No second derivative and no one-sided derivative is introduced here.**
  Both are standard, and both are absent from this page on purpose;
  [[rem-derivative-conventions]] records exactly what is fixed and what is left
  open at this point in the reading order.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) with its order and absolute value
([[def-real-order]]).

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$, let $c \in \mathbb{R}$
be a **limit point** of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and let $L \in \mathbb{R}$.
We say that **$f(x)$ tends to $L$ as $x$ tends to $c$**, and write

$$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L ,$$

when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ 0 < |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - L| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

where $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ range over the **positive reals**.

In the language of neighbourhoods ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]) the condition reads:
for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ with

$$f\bigl(A \cap N^{*}_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \;\subseteq\; N_{\varepsilon}(L),$$

$N^{*}_{\delta}(c) = \{\, y : 0 < |y - c| < \delta \,\}$ being the punctured
$\delta$-neighbourhood of $c$ and $N_{\varepsilon}(L) = (L - \varepsilon,\ L +
\varepsilon)$ the open interval of [[def-interval]]. The two forms agree because
$|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ says exactly $f(x) \in N_\varepsilon(L)$, and
$0 < |x - c| < \delta$ says exactly $x \in N^{*}_\delta(c)$.

**Three features of this definition are load bearing, not decoration.**

1. **$c$ is required to be a limit point of $A$.** By [[def-limit-point-r]] that
   says every punctured neighbourhood of $c$ meets $A$, so for every $\delta > 0$
   the set $A \cap N^{*}_\delta(c)$ over which the implication quantifies is
   nonempty. Drop the requirement and the implication can be satisfied
   vacuously by *every* real $L$ at once, which is exactly what
   [[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]] records. At a point of $A$
   that is not a limit point of $A$ — an isolated point — the symbol
   $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ is therefore **not defined** in this library.

2. **$c \in A$ is not required.** A limit point of $A$ need not belong to $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and the definition never evaluates $f$ at $c$. This
   is what allows a limit to be taken at a point where the function is not
   defined at all, as at $0$ for $x \mapsto x\,\psi(1/x)$.

3. **The value $f(c)$, when it exists, is irrelevant.** The hypothesis
   $0 < |x - c|$ excludes $x = c$ from the quantifier, so changing $f$ at the
   single point $c$ changes nothing. Equality of the limit with the value is an
   extra condition, not a consequence: [[fs-limit-equals-value]].

**The notation presumes uniqueness.** Writing $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$ treats
the left-hand side as a name for a single real number, which is legitimate only
because at a limit point at most one $L$ can satisfy the displayed condition.
That obligation is discharged by [[lem-function-limit-unique]], recorded in this
item's `justified_by`. As with $\sup S$ ([[rem-sup-conventions]]) and
$\lim_k x_k$ ([[lem-limit-unique]]), the symbol is written only for a function
already known to have a limit at $c$.

**Real and rational $\varepsilon$ define the same relation.** Above,
$\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ range over the positive reals. Restricting either
quantifier to the positive rationals gives the same relation: every positive
rational is a positive real, and below every positive real lies a positive
rational ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), so an $\varepsilon$-condition verified for
all positive rationals is verified for an arbitrary positive real $\eta$ by
running it at a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, and a
$\delta$ produced as a real may be shrunk to a rational one below it. This is
the passage sanctioned in the remarks of [[def-sequence]], and it is what lets
this definition be compared with [[def-real-limit]], whose $\varepsilon$ is
rational, in [[thm-sequential-criterion-for-function-limits]].

## Remarks

- **Terminology.** *Limit point* here is a property of the set $A$ and the point
  $c$, in the sense of [[def-limit-point-r]]; it has nothing to do with
  subsequential limits ([[def-subsequential-limit]]), and the distinction is the
  one that item records.

- **Why the punctured condition, and not $|x - c| < \delta$.** With the
  unpunctured condition the definition would force $f$ to be defined at $c$ and
  would force $|f(c) - L| < \varepsilon$ for every $\varepsilon$, that is,
  $L = f(c)$. The resulting notion is continuity at $c$, a strictly stronger
  condition, and conflating the two is the error catalogued in
  [[fs-limit-equals-value]].

- **One-sided and infinite variants.** Restricting the domain to one side of $c$
  gives the one-sided limits of [[def-one-sided-limits]]; replacing the
  conditions on $x$ or on $f(x)$ by unboundedness conditions gives the limits at
  and to infinity of [[def-limits-at-infinity]]. Both are built on this
  definition rather than beside it.

## Definition

Let $a \in \mathbb{R}$, where $\mathbb{R}$ is the ambient ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]).

**Natural exponents.** By the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) applied to
the set $\mathbb{R}$, the starting element $1$ and the function
$f(x) = x \cdot a$, there is a unique function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$,
written $n \mapsto a^n$, with

$$a^0 = 1, \qquad a^{n+1} = a^n \cdot a \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Thus $a^1 = a$, $a^2 = a \cdot a$, and so on. Note that this is defined for
**every** $a$, including $a = 0$.

**Negative exponents.** If $a \ne 0$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, set

$$a^{-n} := (a^n)^{-1}.$$

**Why that is legitimate.** The right-hand side presupposes that $a^n$ is
invertible, that is, that $a^n \ne 0$. This is a proof obligation and not an
observation, and it is discharged by claim 2 of [[lem-power-laws]]: for $a \ne 0$
in a field, $a^n \ne 0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, proved there by induction on
$n$ from the fact that a field has no zero divisors ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]).
That lemma is a statement *about* the operation introduced here, so it depends on
this definition and is recorded in this item's `justified_by` rather than in its
`deps` (SCHEMA §3). Given $a^n \ne 0$, the value $(a^n)^{-1}$ is a single
well-determined element, because multiplicative inverses in a field are unique
([[lem-of-inverse-unique]]).

**Integer exponents.** Every integer $m$ ([[def-integers]]) is either
$\iota(n)$ or $-\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$, where $\iota$ is the
embedding $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]],
[[def-int-operations]]). This too is a citation and not a slogan: the order on
$\mathbb{Z}$ is total ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), so $m \ge 0$ or $m < 0$; the
image of $\iota$ is exactly the set of nonnegative integers, and each of them is
$\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]); and if $m < 0$ then
$-m > 0$, by compatibility of the order with addition ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]),
so $-m = \iota(n)$ and $m = -\iota(n)$, with $n$ unique because $\iota$ is
injective. The two clauses above therefore define $a^m$ for every
$m \in \mathbb{Z}$ whenever $a \ne 0$, and for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$ for
arbitrary $a$. The clauses are consistent where they overlap: the only overlap is
$m = 0$, where $-\iota(0) = \iota(0)$ and $(a^0)^{-1} = 1^{-1} = 1 = a^0$.

## Remarks

- **The convention $0^0 = 1$ is adopted here**, and it is not a matter of taste
  but of agreement with the recursion above: $a^0 = 1$ is the starting value for
  every $a$, exactly as the empty product is $1$ ([[def-finite-sum]]). This is
  the convention that makes the empty product, the binomial theorem, and
  polynomial notation $\sum_k c_k x^k$ work at $x = 0$ without an exception. The
  competing convention "$0^0$ undefined" belongs to contexts where $x^y$ is
  studied as a function of two *real* variables and one wants continuity, which
  is unavailable and irrelevant here: the exponent in $a^m$ is an integer, never
  a real.
- $0^n = 0$ for every $n \ge 1$, since $0^{n} = 0^{n-1} \cdot 0 = 0$, a product
  with a zero factor ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]); and
  $0^{-n}$ is not defined for $n \ge 1$, since $0$ has no inverse.
- The exponent is an integer and stays an integer. Rational exponents are a
  separate construction resting on the existence of roots
  ([[thm-nth-roots-exist]], [[def-rational-power]]), and real exponents do not
  exist in this library yet ([[rem-real-exponents-deferred]]).
- The laws $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$ are
  proved, not assumed, in [[lem-power-laws]]; the order behaviour of $a \mapsto a^n$
  is [[lem-power-monotone]].

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]] and closure as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]].

- $x$ is an **adherent point** of $A$ when $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne
  \varnothing$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$.
- $x$ is a **limit point** (or *accumulation point*) of $A$ when
  $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every real
  $\varepsilon > 0$: every punctured neighbourhood of $x$ meets $A$.
- $x$ is an **isolated point** of $A$ when $x \in A$ and there is a real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$.
- The **derived set** of $A$ is
  $$A' \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \text{ is a limit point of } A \,\}.$$
- $A$ is **dense in $\mathbb{R}$** when $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$.

**A limit point is an adherent point**, since $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq
N_\varepsilon(x)$; and an element of $A$ is an adherent point of $A$, since
$x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). So the adherent
points of $A$ are exactly the points of $A \cup A'$, a statement proved as part
of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

**Limit point and isolated point are exact opposites inside $A$.** For
$x \in A$: $x$ is an isolated point of $A$ exactly when it is not a limit point
of $A$. Indeed $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$ says precisely that
$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, because $x$ itself always lies in
$N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ when $x \in A$; so the existence of an $\varepsilon$
witnessing isolation is the negation of the condition defining a limit point.
A point of $A$ is therefore either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$, and
never both.

**A limit point need not belong to the set, and a point of the set need not be a
limit point.** Both possibilities occur, and the two examples that matter later
are $0$, which is a limit point of $\{\, 1/k : k \ge 1 \,\}$ without belonging
to it, and $0$ again, which belongs to $\{0\} \cup [1,2]$ as an isolated point.

## Remarks

- **Terminology: *limit point* here is about a set, never about a sequence.**
  This library reserves *subsequential limit* for the sequential notion
  ([[def-subsequential-limit]]), and the two are genuinely different: the
  constant sequence $x_k = 0$ has $0$ as a subsequential limit, while its set of
  values $\{0\}$ has no limit point at all. The distinction is the one
  [[def-subsequential-limit]] records under "Terminology", and it is respected
  throughout this page.

- **Density is defined through the closure, not through intervals.** Saying
  $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$ is equivalent to saying that every nonempty open
  subset of $\mathbb{R}$ meets $A$, and also to saying that every neighbourhood
  of every real meets $A$; the equivalences follow from
  [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] and are used in that form in
  [[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]].

- **The derived set need not be comparable with the set.** It can be strictly
  larger, as for $\mathbb{Q}$: every punctured neighbourhood of any real
  contains a rational, since density supplies one strictly between $x$ and
  $x + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]), so the derived set of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is all of $\mathbb{R}$. It can be strictly smaller, as for
  $\{0\}$, whose derived set is empty; and it can be neither, as for
  $\{0\} \cup (1,2)$, whose derived set is $[1,2]$, a set containing points
  outside the original and omitting the point $0$ of it. A closed set satisfying
  $A \subseteq A'$ is called perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]).

## Statement

In any field $F$ ([[def-field]]), if $a, b \in F$ satisfy $ab = 0$, then $a = 0$ or $b = 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A field $F$ and elements $a, b \in F$ with $ab = 0$.

[L1] Field axioms ([[def-field]]): if $a \ne 0$ then $a$ has a multiplicative inverse $a^{-1}$ with $a^{-1} a = 1$; multiplication is associative; and $1$ is the multiplicative identity, so $1 \cdot x = x$.

[L2] For every $x \in F$, $x \cdot 0 = 0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]], using commutativity).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 If $a = 0$ the disjunction $a = 0$ or $b = 0$ already holds, so it suffices to assume $a \ne 0$ and derive $b = 0$. [suffices: a ne 0 implies b = 0]

1.2 Assuming $a \ne 0$, the inverse $a^{-1}$ exists with $a^{-1} a = 1$. [L1]

1.3 Since $1$ is the multiplicative identity, $b = 1 \cdot b$. [L1]

1.4 By associativity, $(a^{-1} a) \cdot b = a^{-1} (a b)$. [L1]

1.5 We are given $ab = 0$. [given]

1.6 $a^{-1} \cdot 0 = 0$. [L2]

2.1 Substituting $1 = a^{-1} a$ into $b = 1 \cdot b$ and using associativity gives $b = (a^{-1} a) b = a^{-1}(ab)$. [step 1.2, step 1.3, step 1.4]

2.2 Since $ab = 0$, we have $a^{-1}(ab) = a^{-1} \cdot 0$. [step 1.5]

3.1 Combining, $b = a^{-1}(ab) = a^{-1} \cdot 0 = 0$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 1.6]

4.1 Hence $a \ne 0$ forces $b = 0$, so in every case $a = 0$ or $b = 0$. [step 1.1, step 3.1] ∎

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $c$ be a limit point of $A$
([[def-limit-point-r]]), let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and suppose the limit of $f$
at $c$ exists with $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$ and $L \ne 0$
([[def-function-limit]]). Then there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every
$x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies

$$|f(x)| \;>\; \frac{|L|}{2} \;>\; 0 ;$$

in particular $f(x) \ne 0$ for every such $x$. Moreover:

- if $L > 0$ then $f(x) > L/2 > 0$ for every such $x$;
- if $L < 0$ then $f(x) < L/2 < 0$ for every such $x$.

Consequently, writing

$$A_0 := \{\, x \in A \ : \ f(x) \ne 0 \,\},$$

the point $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$.

**The bound $|L|/2$, and not merely "$f \ne 0$", is what later proofs need.** The
quotient case of [[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]] estimates $1/|f|$ near $c$
and therefore needs a *positive lower* bound on $|f|$ there, and the last claim
is what lets a limit be taken on the smaller domain $A_0$ at all.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a limit point $c$ of $A$, a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and a real $L \ne 0$ with $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$; and $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : f(x) \ne 0 \,\}$ ([[def-function-limit]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L1] The limit condition: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ ([[def-function-limit]]).

[L2] Absolute value: $|u| \ge 0$; $|u| = 0$ if and only if $u = 0$; $|u| = u$ for $u \ge 0$ and $|u| = -u$ for $u \le 0$; and for $t > 0$, $|u| < t$ is equivalent to $-t < u < t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L3] Reverse triangle inequality: $\bigl| |u| - |v| \bigr| \le |u - v|$ ([[cor-of-reverse-triangle]]).

[L4] Limit point: for every real $\rho > 0$ there is $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \rho$ ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L5] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: trichotomy, so $u \ne 0$ with $|u| \ge 0$ and $|u| \ne 0$ forces $|u| > 0$; $0 < 1$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]), hence $2 > 0$ and $2^{-1} > 0$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]), so $t/2 > 0$ and $t - t/2 = t/2$ for $t > 0$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]); adding a constant to an inequality ([[lem-of-add-order]]); and of two positive reals the smaller is positive, the order being total ([[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Since $L \ne 0$ we have $|L| \ne 0$ while $|L| \ge 0$, so trichotomy gives $|L| > 0$, and $\varepsilon := |L|/2 > 0$ with $|L| - |L|/2 = |L|/2$. [given, L2, L5]

2.1 Apply [L1] with this $\varepsilon$: fix a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|f(x) - L| < |L|/2$. [step 1.1, L1, choose]

3.1 For every such $x$ the reverse triangle inequality gives $\bigl| |f(x)| - |L| \bigr| \le |f(x) - L| < |L|/2$, hence $|f(x)| - |L| > -|L|/2$ and so $|f(x)| > |L| - |L|/2 = |L|/2 > 0$; in particular $|f(x)| \ne 0$ and therefore $f(x) \ne 0$. [step 2.1, L2, L3, L5]

3.2 If $L > 0$ then $|L| = L$, and for every such $x$ the estimate $|f(x) - L| < L/2$ gives $-L/2 < f(x) - L$, that is $f(x) > L - L/2 = L/2 > 0$. [step 2.1, L2, L5]

3.3 If $L < 0$ then $|L| = -L$, and for every such $x$ the estimate $|f(x) - L| < -L/2$ gives $f(x) - L < -L/2$, that is $f(x) < L - L/2 = L/2 < 0$. [step 2.1, L2, L5]

4.1 Let $\eta > 0$ be an arbitrary real and let $\rho$ be the smaller of $\delta$ and $\eta$, so $\rho > 0$. Since $c$ is a limit point of $A$ there is $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \rho$; that $x$ satisfies $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, hence $f(x) \ne 0$ by step 3.1, so $x \in A_0$ and $0 < |x - c| < \eta$. As $\eta$ was arbitrary, $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$. [step 3.1, L4, L5]

5.1 So on $A \cap N^{*}_{\delta}(c)$ the function is bounded away from $0$ by $|L|/2$ and carries the sign of $L$, and $c$ remains a limit point of the set $A_0$ where $f$ does not vanish. [step 3.1, step 3.2, step 3.3, step 4.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why $|L|/2$ and not some other fraction.** Any $\varepsilon$ strictly between $0$ and $|L|$ gives a positive lower bound $|L| - \varepsilon$; the choice $\varepsilon = |L|/2$ makes the bound $|L|/2$, which is the form used downstream and needs only that $2$ is invertible and positive ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

- **The last claim is the one that is easy to forget.** Restricting a quotient to the set where the denominator does not vanish is useless unless $c$ is still a limit point of that set, since [[def-function-limit]] is stated only at a limit point. Step 4.1 is exactly that check, and it is what [[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]] cites when it forms $A_0$.

- **Nothing here says anything about $f(c)$.** As always the point $c$ itself is excluded by $0 < |x - c|$, so $f(c)$ may be $0$ even when $L \ne 0$; the function of [[fs-limit-equals-value]], read with the roles of $0$ and $1$ exchanged, is such an example.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$, let
$\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Suppose $f$ and $g$ are continuous at
$c$ ([[def-continuity-real]]). Then:

1. $f + g$, $\alpha f$ and $fg$ are continuous at $c$;
2. $|f|$, the function $x \mapsto |f(x)|$, is continuous at $c$;
3. $\max\{f,g\}$ and $\min\{f,g\}$, defined pointwise by
   $x \mapsto \max\{f(x), g(x)\}$ and $x \mapsto \min\{f(x), g(x)\}$
   ([[def-max-min]]), are continuous at $c$;
4. if $g(c) \ne 0$ then, writing $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$, the
   point $c$ lies in $A_0$ and the quotient
   $(f/g)|_{A_0} : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$, $x \mapsto f(x)/g(x)$, is continuous at
   $c$ as a function on $A_0$.

Moreover, with no hypothesis at all:

5. every constant function $A \to \mathbb{R}$ and the identity
   $\mathrm{id} : A \to \mathbb{R}$, $x \mapsto x$, are continuous on $A$; hence
   so is $x \mapsto x^{n}$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$
   ([[def-integer-power]]), and hence so is every **polynomial function**
   $x \mapsto a_0 + a_1 x + \dots + a_n x^{n}$ with real coefficients.

Consequently, if $f$ and $g$ are continuous **on** $A$ then so are $f+g$,
$\alpha f$, $fg$, $|f|$, $\max\{f,g\}$ and $\min\{f,g\}$, and
$(f/g)|_{A_0}$ is continuous on $A_0$.

**Claim 4 is stated on $A_0$ because $f/g$ is not defined where $g$ vanishes**,
and $g$ may well vanish at points of $A$ far from $c$. The hypothesis is
$g(c) \ne 0$, not "$g$ nowhere zero"; what it buys is that $c$ itself lies in
the smaller domain, which is what makes continuity there mean anything.

**Nothing here is proved through a sequence.** Claims 1 and 4 are read off from
[[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]], which is itself proved from $\varepsilon$
and $\delta$, and claims 2, 3 and 5 are proved directly below. So no choice
principle is used anywhere in this item.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, functions $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\alpha$, a point $c \in A$ at which $f$ and $g$ are continuous, and, for claim 4, the hypothesis $g(c) \ne 0$ together with $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$.

[L1] Continuity at $c$: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L2] A point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$, and never both; at an isolated point of its domain every function is continuous; at a limit point $c$ of $A$, continuity of $f$ at $c$ is exactly the statement that the limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and equals $f(c)$ ([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-function-limit]]).

[L3] Algebra of function limits at a limit point $c$ of $A$: if the limits of $f$ and $g$ at $c$ exist with values $L$ and $M$, then the limits of $f+g$, $\alpha f$ and $fg$ at $c$ exist with values $L+M$, $\alpha L$ and $LM$; and if $M \ne 0$ then $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$, and the limit of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$ exists and equals $L/M$ ([[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]]).

[L4] Sign preservation: if the limit of $g$ at a limit point $c$ of $A$ exists and is nonzero, then $c$ is a limit point of $A_0 = \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$ ([[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]]).

[L5] Reverse triangle inequality: $\bigl||u| - |v|\bigr| \le |u - v|$ ([[cor-of-reverse-triangle]]); and $|u| \ge 0$, $|u| = 0$ exactly when $u = 0$, $|uv| = |u||v|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L6] Maximum and minimum of a two-element set of reals exist ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]), and for all reals $u, v$ one has $\max\{u,v\} = \tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(u + v + |u-v|\bigr)$ and $\min\{u,v\} = \tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(u + v - |u-v|\bigr)$.

[L7] Ordered-field arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: trichotomy and totality of the order, the field identities, and $0 < 1$ so that $2 \ne 0$ and $t/2$ is defined ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]).

[L8] Integer powers: $a^{0} = 1$ and $a^{n+1} = a^{n} \cdot a$ ([[def-integer-power]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Justification of the identity in [L6].** Let $u, v \in \mathbb{R}$. By totality either $u \ge v$ or $v \ge u$. If $u \ge v$ then $u - v \ge 0$, so $|u-v| = u-v$ and $\tfrac{1}{2}(u+v+|u-v|) = \tfrac{1}{2}(2u) = u = \max\{u,v\}$, while $\tfrac{1}{2}(u+v-|u-v|) = v = \min\{u,v\}$. If $v \ge u$ the same computation with the roles exchanged applies, since $|u-v| = v-u$ there. [L5, L6, L7]

1.2 **The isolated case.** Suppose $c$ is an isolated point of $A$, say $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ with $\eta > 0$ real. Then every function on $A$ is continuous at $c$ by [L2], which gives claims 1, 2 and 3 at once. For claim 4, assume $g(c) \ne 0$; then $c \in A_0$, and $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A_0 \subseteq N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ with $c$ in the left-hand side, so $c$ is an isolated point of $A_0$ and every function on $A_0$, in particular $(f/g)|_{A_0}$, is continuous at $c$. [L2]

1.3 **Claim 2, at any point of $A$.** Let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given and let $\delta > 0$ be as in [L1] for $f$ and this $\varepsilon$. For $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ the reverse triangle inequality gives $\bigl||f(x)| - |f(c)|\bigr| \le |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$. So $|f|$ is continuous at $c$, and no case distinction was needed. [L1, L5]

1.4 **Claim 5, constants and the identity.** If $f$ is constant then $|f(x) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$ for every $x \in A$ and every real $\varepsilon > 0$, so any $\delta > 0$ serves. For the identity, given a real $\varepsilon > 0$ take $\delta := \varepsilon$: every $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ has $|\mathrm{id}(x) - \mathrm{id}(c)| = |x - c| < \varepsilon$. Both are continuous at every point of $A$. [L1, L5, L7]

1.5 **The limit-point case, claim 1.** Suppose $c$ is a limit point of $A$. By [L2] the limits of $f$ and of $g$ at $c$ exist and equal $f(c)$ and $g(c)$. By [L3] the limits of $f+g$, $\alpha f$ and $fg$ at $c$ exist and equal $f(c)+g(c)$, $\alpha f(c)$ and $f(c)g(c)$, which are exactly the values of those three functions at $c$; by [L2] again, each of them is continuous at $c$. [L2, L3]

1.6 **The limit-point case, claim 4.** Suppose $c$ is a limit point of $A$ and $g(c) \ne 0$. Then $c \in A_0$, and by [L4] the point $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$. By [L3] the limit of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$ exists and equals $f(c)/g(c)$, which is the value of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$; by [L2] applied on the domain $A_0$, that function is continuous at $c$. [L2, L3, L4]

2.1 **Claims 1 and 4 in general.** By [L2] the point $c$ is either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$; step 1.2 settles the first case and steps 1.5 and 1.6 the second. So claims 1 and 4 hold as stated. [step 1.2, step 1.5, step 1.6, L2]

3.1 **Claim 3.** By claim 1 the function $f - g = f + (-1)g$ is continuous at $c$, by step 1.3 so is $|f-g|$, and by claim 1 again so are $f + g + |f-g|$ and its scalar multiple by $1/2$. By step 1.1 that scalar multiple is the function $x \mapsto \max\{f(x), g(x)\}$, so the maximum is continuous at $c$; the same argument with $-|f-g|$ gives the minimum. [step 1.1, step 1.3, step 2.1, L6, L7]

3.2 **Claim 5, powers and polynomials.** The map $x \mapsto x^{0}$ is the constant $1$ and $x \mapsto x^{1}$ is the identity, both continuous on $A$ by step 1.4; and if $x \mapsto x^{n}$ is continuous on $A$ then so is $x \mapsto x^{n+1} = x^{n} \cdot x$, being a product of two functions continuous on $A$ by step 2.1. By induction on $n$, $x \mapsto x^{n}$ is continuous on $A$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. A polynomial function $a_0 + a_1x + \dots + a_nx^{n}$ is obtained from these by finitely many scalar multiplications and additions, each of which preserves continuity by step 2.1. [step 1.4, step 2.1, L8]

4.1 Claims 1 to 5 are proved, all of them at an arbitrary point $c$ of $A$ and therefore, applied at every point, on the whole of $A$; and no sequence and no choice principle was used. [step 1.3, step 2.1, step 3.1, step 3.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the two-case shape, and why it is not an inconvenience.** Continuity is defined at every point of the domain, including isolated points, where no limit exists ([[def-continuity-real]]). The algebra of limits therefore cannot be applied blindly; but at an isolated point every function is continuous, so the case is settled before it is opened. Claims 2 and 5 are proved directly from $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ and need no case distinction at all.

- **Absolute value, maximum and minimum are not in [[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]]**, and the reason is that they are not needed there. They are needed here: the extreme value theorem and the one-dimensional fixed point theorem both build auxiliary functions out of maxima, minima and differences, and [[thm-compactness-is-necessary-for-evt-and-uniform-continuity]] builds its witnesses out of $|x - x_0|$ and quotients.

- **The converse of claim 2 is false**: $|f|$ may be continuous while $f$ is continuous nowhere. The function equal to $1$ on $\mathbb{Q}$ and to $-1$ elsewhere has constant absolute value; that it is nowhere continuous follows from the argument of [[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]] applied verbatim, since that argument uses only that the two values are distinct.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $c$ be a limit point of $A$
([[def-limit-point-r]]), let $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $\alpha \in
\mathbb{R}$. Suppose the limits of $f$ and of $g$ at $c$ exist, and write
$L := \lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ and $M := \lim_{x \to c} g(x)$
([[def-function-limit]]). Then:

1. the limit of $f + g$ at $c$ exists, and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} (f + g)(x) \;=\; \lim_{x \to c} f(x) + \lim_{x \to c} g(x) \;=\; L + M ;$$
2. the limit of $\alpha f$ at $c$ exists, and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} (\alpha f)(x) \;=\; \alpha \lim_{x \to c} f(x) \;=\; \alpha L ;$$
3. the limit of $fg$ at $c$ exists, and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} (fg)(x) \;=\; \Bigl(\lim_{x \to c} f(x)\Bigr)\Bigl(\lim_{x \to c} g(x)\Bigr) \;=\; LM ;$$
4. if $M \ne 0$, then, writing $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$, the point
   $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$, the quotient $f/g$ is defined on $A_0$ by
   $(f/g)(x) = f(x) / g(x)$, the limit of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$ exists, and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} (f/g)|_{A_0}(x) \;=\; \frac{\lim_{x \to c} f(x)}{\lim_{x \to c} g(x)} \;=\; \frac{L}{M} .$$

Each equation asserts two things at once: that the limit on the left exists, and
that it has the stated value. Both are proved. The symbols denote by
[[lem-function-limit-unique]].

**Everything below is proved directly from $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$.** No
sequence is constructed and no choice principle is used, so all four claims are
theorems of ZF. Passing through
[[thm-sequential-criterion-for-function-limits]] instead would import the
countable choice spent in that theorem's converse direction, for no gain; see
[[rem-heine-criterion-choice-cost]].

**Why the quotient is stated on $A_0$.** The function $f/g$ is simply not defined
where $g$ vanishes, and $g$ may well vanish at points of $A$ arbitrarily far from
$c$; restricting to $A_0$ is therefore forced. That this restriction still has
$c$ as a limit point, so that the limit there means anything at all, is the last
claim of [[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]]. The sequential analogue
[[thm-algebra-of-limits]] needs the corresponding hypothesis in the form "the
denominator sequence is nonzero at every index".

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a limit point $c$ of $A$, functions $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\alpha$, and reals $L, M$ with $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$ and $\lim_{x \to c} g(x) = M$; for claim 4 also $M \ne 0$ and $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$ ([[def-function-limit]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L1] The limit condition: $\lim_{x \to c} h(x) = P$ means that for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x$ in the domain of $h$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|h(x) - P| < \varepsilon$ ([[def-function-limit]]).

[L2] Absolute value: $|u| \ge 0$; $|u| = 0$ if and only if $u = 0$; $|uv| = |u|\,|v|$; and $|{-u}| = |u|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L3] Triangle inequality: $|u + v| \le |u| + |v|$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L4] Order and field arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: adding two strict inequalities ([[lem-of-add-order]]); for $t > 0$, $u < v$ is equivalent to $ut < vt$, and $0 \le u \le v$ with $0 \le s \le t$ gives $us \le vt$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]); positive elements have positive inverses and $0 < a < b$ gives $0 < 1/b < 1/a$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]); $0 < 1$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]), so $2 > 0$ and $t/2 > 0$ for $t > 0$; inverses and the field identities ([[def-field]]); trichotomy and totality, so of finitely many positive reals the smallest is positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] Local boundedness: there are a real $\delta_0 > 0$ and a real $K \ge 0$ with $|f(x)| \le K$ for every $x \in A$ satisfying $0 < |x - c| < \delta_0$ ([[lem-limit-implies-local-boundedness]]).

[L6] Sign preservation: if $M \ne 0$ there is a real $\delta_s > 0$ with $|g(x)| > |M|/2 > 0$ for every $x \in A$ satisfying $0 < |x - c| < \delta_s$, and $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$ ([[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]]).

[L7] Restriction: if $B \subseteq A$ has $c$ as a limit point and $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$, then $\lim_{x \to c} f|_B(x) = L$ (claim 2 of [[lem-limit-is-local]]).

[L8] Neighbourhoods ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Sum.** Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real. By [L1] fix reals $\delta_1, \delta_2 > 0$ with $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon/2$ for every $x \in A$ satisfying $0 < |x - c| < \delta_1$ and $|g(x) - M| < \varepsilon/2$ for every $x \in A$ satisfying $0 < |x - c| < \delta_2$, and let $\delta$ be the smaller of the two, so $\delta > 0$. For $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ we get $|(f+g)(x) - (L+M)| = |(f(x) - L) + (g(x) - M)| \le |f(x) - L| + |g(x) - M| < \varepsilon$. As $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary, the limit of $f + g$ at $c$ exists and equals $L + M$: claim 1. [L1, L2, L3, L4, choose]

1.2 **Scalar multiple.** If $\alpha = 0$ then $\alpha f$ is the constant function $0$ and $\alpha L = 0$, so $|(\alpha f)(x) - \alpha L| = 0 < \varepsilon$ for every $x$ and every $\varepsilon > 0$, any $\delta$ serving. If $\alpha \ne 0$ then $|\alpha| > 0$; given a real $\varepsilon > 0$, [L1] supplies $\delta > 0$ with $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon/|\alpha|$ on $A \cap N^{*}_{\delta}(c)$, and there $|(\alpha f)(x) - \alpha L| = |\alpha|\,|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$. So the limit of $\alpha f$ at $c$ exists and equals $\alpha L$: claim 2. [L1, L2, L4, L8, choose]

1.3 **A working bound for $f$ near $c$.** By [L5] fix a real $\delta_0 > 0$ and a real $K \ge 0$ with $|f(x)| \le K$ for every $x \in A$ satisfying $0 < |x - c| < \delta_0$, and put $K' := K + 1$, so $K' > 0$ and $|f(x)| \le K'$ for all those $x$. [L4, L5, choose]

1.4 **The denominator near $c$.** Assume $M \ne 0$. By [L6] fix a real $\delta_s > 0$ with $|g(x)| > |M|/2 > 0$ for every $x \in A$ satisfying $0 < |x - c| < \delta_s$; every such $x$ has $g(x) \ne 0$, hence lies in $A_0$, and $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$. [L2, L4, L6]

2.1 **Product.** Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real. By [L1] fix reals $\delta_1, \delta_2 > 0$ with $|g(x) - M| < \varepsilon/(2K')$ on $A \cap N^{*}_{\delta_1}(c)$ and $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon / \bigl(2(|M| + 1)\bigr)$ on $A \cap N^{*}_{\delta_2}(c)$, and let $\delta$ be the smallest of $\delta_0, \delta_1, \delta_2$, which is positive. For $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, $|f(x)g(x) - LM| = |f(x)(g(x) - M) + M(f(x) - L)| \le |f(x)|\,|g(x) - M| + |M|\,|f(x) - L| \le K'\,|g(x) - M| + (|M|+1)\,|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$. As $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary, the limit of $fg$ at $c$ exists and equals $LM$: claim 3. [step 1.3, L1, L2, L3, L4, L8, choose]

2.2 **Reciprocal.** Assume $M \ne 0$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real. By [L1] fix a real $\delta_3 > 0$ with $|g(x) - M| < \varepsilon |M|^2 / 2$ on $A \cap N^{*}_{\delta_3}(c)$, and let $\delta$ be the smaller of $\delta_s$ and $\delta_3$. For $x \in A_0$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ we have $|g(x)| > |M|/2 > 0$, hence $|g(x)|\,|M| > |M|^2/2 > 0$ and so $1/(|g(x)|\,|M|) < 2/|M|^2$; therefore $\bigl| 1/g(x) - 1/M \bigr| = |M - g(x)| \big/ \bigl(|g(x)|\,|M|\bigr) < (\varepsilon |M|^2/2)\cdot(2/|M|^2) = \varepsilon$. As $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary, the limit of $(1/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$ exists and equals $1/M$. [step 1.4, L1, L2, L4, L8, choose]

2.3 **The numerator on the smaller domain.** Assume $M \ne 0$. Since $A_0 \subseteq A$ and $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$ by step 1.4, [L7] gives that the limit of $f|_{A_0}$ at $c$ exists and equals $L$. [step 1.4, L7]

3.1 **Quotient.** Assume $M \ne 0$. On the domain $A_0$, which has $c$ as a limit point, the two functions $f|_{A_0}$ and $(1/g)|_{A_0}$ have limits $L$ and $1/M$ at $c$ by steps 2.3 and 2.2, and their product is $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ by the field identities; so claim 3, applied on the domain $A_0$, gives that the limit of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$ exists and equals $L \cdot (1/M) = L/M$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, L2, L4]

4.1 Claims 1 to 4 are proved, each directly from the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ definition and none of them through a sequence. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.1, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The product estimate in one line.** The identity $fg - LM = f\,(g - M) + M\,(f - L)$ turns the problem into two products, one with a factor that is merely bounded near $c$ (that is $f$, and [[lem-limit-implies-local-boundedness]] is what bounds it) and one with a constant factor. The two constants $K'$ and $|M| + 1$ are used in place of $K$ and $|M|$ only so that they are strictly positive and may be divided by; that is the sole reason for adding $1$.

- **The reciprocal estimate in one line.** The identity $1/g - 1/M = (M - g)/(gM)$ turns the problem into a numerator that is small and a denominator that must be kept away from $0$; the lower bound $|g| > |M|/2$ from [[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]] does exactly that, and gives the working factor $2/|M|^2$.

- **Nothing here extends to $\pm\infty$.** The statement is about a finite limit point $c$ and finite values $L, M$; [[def-limits-at-infinity]] introduces limits at and to infinity, but no algebra of such limits is proved in this library, and none may be assumed. The companion page's limit at $+\infty$ is computed by a direct estimate for precisely that reason.

- **The sequential analogue** is [[thm-algebra-of-limits]]. Neither implies the other for free: this theorem is about a function on a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ and is proved from $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$; that one is about sequences.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$ be a
limit point of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]). The following are equivalent.

1. $f$ is differentiable at $c$ ([[def-derivative]]).
2. There is a function $\varphi : A \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $c$
   ([[def-continuity-real]]), with
   $$f(x) - f(c) \;=\; \varphi(x)\,(x - c) \qquad \text{for every } x \in A .$$

When they hold, the function $\varphi$ of claim 2 is **unique** and satisfies
$\varphi(c) = f'(c)$.

**What the reformulation buys.** Claim 2 contains no quotient and no limit: it
is an algebraic identity plus a continuity hypothesis at one point. Every
differentiation rule on this page is proved by exhibiting the factor $\varphi$
for the new function and reading its continuity off the algebra and composition
theorems for continuous functions. In particular the chain rule becomes a
one-line substitution, with none of the case analysis that the
difference-quotient proof needs where the inner increment vanishes.

**The hypothesis that $c$ is a limit point of $A$ is used in both directions.**
It is what makes $f'(c)$ a defined symbol at all ([[def-derivative]]), and it is
what makes continuity of $\varphi$ at $c$ equivalent to a statement about the
limit of $\varphi$ there ([[def-continuity-real]], clause 1). At an isolated
point of $A$ claim 2 holds for *every* $f$, with $\varphi$ arbitrary off $c$,
because every function is continuous at an isolated point; claim 1 is not even a
statement there.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and a point $c \in A$ that is a limit point of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L1] Differentiability at $c$ ([[def-derivative]]): the difference quotient $q(x) := (f(x) - f(c))/(x - c)$ is a function on $A \setminus \{c\}$, the point $c$ is a limit point of $A \setminus \{c\}$, and $f$ is differentiable at $c$ exactly when $\lim_{x \to c} q(x)$ exists, its value then being $f'(c)$; moreover, for any $Q : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agreeing with $q$ on $A \setminus \{c\}$ and any real $L$, the conditions $\lim_{x \to c} Q(x) = L$ and $\lim_{x \to c} q(x) = L$ are the same condition, since the clause $0 < |x - c|$ removes $x = c$ from both quantifiers.

[L2] The limit condition ([[def-function-limit]]): $\lim_{x \to c} h(x) = L$ means that for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x$ in the domain of $h$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|h(x) - L| < \varepsilon$.

[L3] Continuity at a limit point ([[def-continuity-real]], clause 1): for $c \in A$ a limit point of $A$, a function $\psi : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if $\lim_{x \to c} \psi(x)$ exists and equals $\psi(c)$.

[L4] At a limit point of its domain a function has at most one limit ([[lem-function-limit-unique]]).

[L5] Locality (claim 1 of [[lem-limit-is-local]]): if two functions on $A$ agree at every $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \eta$ for some real $\eta > 0$, then for every real $L$ one has $\lim_{x \to c} = L$ for the first exactly when it holds for the second.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Claim 1 implies claim 2: the factor.** Assume $f$ is differentiable at $c$, and define $\varphi : A \to \mathbb{R}$ by $\varphi(x) := (f(x) - f(c))/(x - c)$ for $x \in A$ with $x \ne c$, and $\varphi(c) := f'(c)$. This is a function on the whole of $A$, since every $x \in A$ falls under exactly one of the two clauses and the division is by a nonzero number. [L1, construct]

1.2 **Claim 2 implies claim 1: the hypothesis.** Assume instead that some $\varphi : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$ and satisfies $f(x) - f(c) = \varphi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in A$. [assume-hyp]

1.3 **Uniqueness.** Let $\varphi$ and $\psi$ both be as in claim 2. For $x \in A$ with $x \ne c$ the identity gives $\varphi(x)(x - c) = f(x) - f(c) = \psi(x)(x - c)$, and dividing by $x - c \ne 0$ gives $\varphi(x) = \psi(x)$; so the two agree on $A \setminus \{c\}$, hence at every $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < 1$. By [L3] each has a limit at $c$, equal to its own value there; by [L5] those two limits are limits of functions agreeing near $c$, so by [L4] they are equal, that is $\varphi(c) = \psi(c)$. Hence $\varphi = \psi$. [L3, L4, L5]

2.1 **The identity holds for the factor built in step 1.1.** For $x \in A$ with $x \ne c$, multiplying the defining equation $\varphi(x) = (f(x) - f(c))/(x - c)$ by $x - c$ gives $\varphi(x)(x - c) = f(x) - f(c)$; and at $x = c$ both sides are $0$, since $f(c) - f(c) = 0$ and $\varphi(c)(c - c) = 0$. So the identity of claim 2 holds for every $x \in A$. [step 1.1]

2.2 **The factor built in step 1.1 is continuous at $c$.** That $\varphi$ agrees with the difference quotient $q$ at every point of $A \setminus \{c\}$ is its definition, so by [L1] the limit $\lim_{x \to c} \varphi(x)$ exists and equals $f'(c)$, which is $\varphi(c)$. Since $c$ is a limit point of $A$, [L3] turns that into continuity of $\varphi$ at $c$. [step 1.1, L1, L3]

2.3 **Under the hypothesis of step 1.2, $\varphi$ extends the difference quotient.** For $x \in A$ with $x \ne c$, dividing the identity by $x - c \ne 0$ gives $q(x) = \varphi(x)(x-c)/(x-c) = \varphi(x)$. So $\varphi$ agrees with $q$ at every point of $A \setminus \{c\}$. [step 1.2]

2.4 **Under the hypothesis of step 1.2, $\varphi$ has a limit at $c$.** Continuity of $\varphi$ at the limit point $c$ gives, by [L3], that $\lim_{x \to c} \varphi(x)$ exists and equals $\varphi(c)$. [step 1.2, L3]

3.1 **Claim 2 implies claim 1.** By step 2.3 the function $\varphi$ agrees with $q$ off $c$, so the last clause of [L1] applies with $Q := \varphi$ and $L := \varphi(c)$: from $\lim_{x \to c} \varphi(x) = \varphi(c)$, given by step 2.4, it follows that $\lim_{x \to c} q(x) = \varphi(c)$. By [L1] again, $f$ is differentiable at $c$ and $f'(c) = \varphi(c)$. [step 2.3, step 2.4, L1, L2]

4.1 Both implications and both supplementary claims are proved: claim 1 gives claim 2 by steps 1.1, 2.1 and 2.2, with $\varphi(c) = f'(c)$ by construction; claim 2 gives claim 1 by step 3.1, with $\varphi(c) = f'(c)$ established there; and the factor is unique by step 1.3. [step 1.1, step 1.3, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The identity at $x = c$ is empty, and that is the point.** Both sides vanish there whatever $\varphi(c)$ is, so the identity alone determines $\varphi$ only off $c$; it is the *continuity* hypothesis that pins the remaining value, and it pins it to $f'(c)$. Drop continuity and claim 2 becomes true for every $f$ whatsoever, with $\varphi(c)$ arbitrary.

- **Why this is not circular.** The proof of claim 2 from claim 1 builds $\varphi$ out of the very quotient whose limit is $f'(c)$, so nothing new is asserted in that direction. The content is the other direction: a factorisation with a factor merely continuous at one point already forces the quotient to converge. That is the direction every rule on this page uses.

- **The factor is a genuinely useful object, not a device.** For $f(x) = x^{n}$ it can be written down in closed form, as the polynomial $\varphi(x) = \sum_{k < n} c^{k} x^{\,n-1-k}$ supplied by [[lem-power-difference-factorisation]]; the companion page writes that factor out and differentiates a composite with it.
