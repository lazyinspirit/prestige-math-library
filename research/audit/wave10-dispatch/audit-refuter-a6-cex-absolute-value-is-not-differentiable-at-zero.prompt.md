## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` proof, actively search for a counterexample. A false
public claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or
materially inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is
nonfatal.

Return no more than 450 words, exactly in this shape:

## Statement refuted

**Refuted claim:** if $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, if $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is
continuous at a point $c \in A$ ([[def-continuity-real]]) and if $c$ is a limit
point of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]), then $f$ is differentiable at $c$
([[def-derivative]]).

This is the converse of [[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]], and it is
false. The witness is $f(x) = |x|$ on $A = \mathbb{R}$ at $c = 0$: a single
corner is enough, and the failure is visible in one line, the difference
quotient taking the value $1$ to the right of $0$ and $-1$ to the left.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The set $A := \mathbb{R}$, the function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, $f(x) := |x|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]), and the point $c := 0$.

[L1] Continuity of the absolute value ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]]): the identity is continuous at every point of its domain (claim 5), and $|h|$ is continuous wherever $h$ is (claim 2); so $f$ is continuous at every point of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L2] Derivative ([[def-derivative]]): $0$ is a limit point of $\mathbb{R}$, punctured neighbourhoods being never empty ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]); the difference quotient of $f$ at $0$ is $q(x) = (|x| - |0|)/(x - 0)$ on $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$; and $f$ is differentiable at $0$ exactly when $\lim_{x \to 0} q(x)$ exists ([[def-function-limit]]).

[L3] Absolute value ([[lem-of-abs-value]]): $|0| = 0$; $|u| = u$ for $u \ge 0$; and $|u| = -u$ for $u \le 0$.

[L4] One-sided limits ([[def-one-sided-limits]], [[def-interval]]): for $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $p \in \mathbb{R}$, the right limit of $h : D \to \mathbb{R}$ at $p$ is the limit at $p$ of $h$ restricted to $D \cap (p, \infty)$, defined when $p$ is a limit point of that set, and the left limit is the same with $D \cap (-\infty, p)$.

[L5] Two-sided against one-sided ([[thm-two-sided-limit-iff-both-one-sided]]): if $p$ is a limit point of both $D \cap (-\infty,p)$ and $D \cap (p,\infty)$, then for every real $L$ the equality $\lim_{x \to p} h(x) = L$ holds if and only if both one-sided limits at $p$ exist and equal $L$.

[L6] At a limit point of its domain a function has at most one limit ([[lem-function-limit-unique]]); and the limit of a constant function $K$ at a limit point of its domain is $K$, any $\delta$ serving ([[def-function-limit]]).

[L7] $1 \ne -1$: $0 < 1$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]) gives $-1 < 0 < 1$, and trichotomy forbids equality.

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $f$ is continuous at every point of $\mathbb{R}$, in particular at $0$. [L1]

1.2 $f(0) = |0| = 0$, so the difference quotient of $f$ at $0$ is $q(x) = |x|/x$ on $D := \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$. [L2, L3]

1.3 $D \cap (0,\infty) = (0,\infty)$ and $D \cap (-\infty,0) = (-\infty,0)$, and $0$ is a limit point of each: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the point $\varepsilon/2$ lies in $(0,\infty)$ with $0 < |\varepsilon/2 - 0| < \varepsilon$, and $-\varepsilon/2$ lies in $(-\infty,0)$ with $0 < |-\varepsilon/2 - 0| < \varepsilon$. [L3, L4]

2.1 For $x > 0$ one has $|x| = x$, so $q(x) = x/x = 1$; for $x < 0$ one has $|x| = -x$, so $q(x) = (-x)/x = -1$. Thus $q$ restricted to $(0,\infty)$ is the constant $1$ and $q$ restricted to $(-\infty,0)$ is the constant $-1$. [step 1.2, L3]

3.1 By [L6] and step 1.3 the two restrictions have limits at $0$, namely $1$ and $-1$; so by [L4] the right limit of $q$ at $0$ is $1$ and the left limit is $-1$. [step 1.3, step 2.1, L4, L6]

4.1 Suppose $\lim_{x \to 0} q(x) = L$ for some real $L$. By step 1.3 the point $0$ is a limit point of both one-sided sets, so [L5] forces both one-sided limits to equal $L$; with step 3.1 and [L6] that gives $L = 1$ and $L = -1$, hence $1 = -1$, which [L7] forbids. So $q$ has no limit at $0$, and by [L2] the function $f$ is not differentiable at $0$. [step 3.1, L2, L5, L6, L7]

5.1 The refuted claim therefore fails at $A := \mathbb{R}$, $f := |\cdot|$ and $c := 0$: the point $0$ is a limit point of $\mathbb{R}$, $f$ is continuous at $0$ by step 1.1, and $f$ is not differentiable at $0$ by step 4.1. [step 1.1, step 4.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The failure is one-sided in a precise sense.** Both one-sided limits of the difference quotient exist; they simply disagree. So this is not a function whose difference quotients oscillate or blow up, and the restriction of $f$ to $[0,\infty)$ is differentiable at $0$ with derivative $1$, as [[def-derivative]] records when it observes that differentiability is a property of the pair (function, domain).

- **What this says about [[cor-differentiable-implies-continuous]].** That implication is strict: continuity is genuinely weaker than differentiability, and this witness shows the gap opens at a single point of an otherwise unremarkable function. Nothing here suggests the gap is small in any other sense; how large the set of non-differentiability of a continuous function can be is not a question this page can pose.

- **Why the argument needs [[thm-two-sided-limit-iff-both-one-sided]] and not merely two computations.** Two different one-sided values do not by themselves contradict anything until one knows that a two-sided limit would have to agree with both, and that is exactly what the cited theorem supplies, under the hypothesis that $0$ is approached from both sides inside the domain.

At\n   an isolated point of its domain a function is neither differentiable nor\n   non-differentiable here: the question is not posed.\n\n**The limit sees only $A \\setminus \\{c\\}$, so how the difference quotient is\nextended to $c$ is irrelevant.** Let $Q : A \\to \\mathbb{R}$ agree with\n$q_{f,c}$ at every point of $A \\setminus \\{c\\}$, and let $L \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nThen $\\lim_{x \\to c} Q(x) = L$ if and only if $\\lim_{x \\to c} q_{f,c}(x) = L$.\nBoth conditions read: for every real $\\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real\n$\\delta > 0$ such that every point $x$ of the relevant domain with\n$0 < |x - c| < \\delta$ satisfies $|{\\cdot} - L| < \\varepsilon$\n([[def-function-limit]]). The clause $0 < |x - c|$ removes $x = c$ from both\nquantifiers, so in both cases the points quantified over are exactly the\n$x \\in A \\setminus \\{c\\}$ with $0 < |x - c| < \\delta$, at which $Q$ and\n$q_{f,c}$ take the same value.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$ be a
limit point of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]). If $f$ is differentiable at $c$
([[def-derivative]]) then $f$ is continuous at $c$ ([[def-continuity-real]]).

Consequently, if $f$ is differentiable on a set $S \subseteq A$ then $f$ is
continuous at every point of $S$.

**No converse is asserted, and none holds.** Continuity at $c$ does not give
differentiability at $c$, and the standard witness is worked out on the
companion page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and a point $c \in A$ that is a limit point of $A$ at which $f$ is differentiable ([[def-derivative]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L1] Carathéodory's characterisation ([[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]]): since $f$ is differentiable at the limit point $c$ of $A$, there is $\varphi : A \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $c$, with $f(x) - f(c) = \varphi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in A$, and $\varphi(c) = f'(c)$.

[L2] Algebra of continuous functions ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]]): sums, scalar multiples and products of functions continuous at a point of the common domain are continuous there (claim 1); and every constant function on $A$ and the identity $x \mapsto x$ on $A$ are continuous at every point of $A$ (claim 5).

[L3] Continuity of $f$ at $c$ is the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ condition of [[def-continuity-real]], and continuity on a set is continuity at each of its points.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Fix a function $\varphi : A \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $c$, with $f(x) - f(c) = \varphi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in A$. [L1, choose]

1.2 The identity $x \mapsto x$ on $A$ and every constant function on $A$ are continuous at $c$; hence so is $x \mapsto x - c$, which is the sum of the identity and the constant function with value $-c$. [L2]

2.1 The pointwise product $x \mapsto \varphi(x)(x - c)$ is continuous at $c$, being the product of two functions on $A$ continuous at $c$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L2]

3.1 For every $x \in A$ one has $f(x) = f(c) + \varphi(x)(x - c)$, so $f$ is the sum of the constant function with value $f(c)$ and the product of step 2.1. [step 1.1, L1]

4.1 A sum of two functions continuous at $c$ is continuous at $c$, so $f$ is continuous at $c$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L2, L3]

5.1 The point $c$ was an arbitrary point of $A$, a limit point of $A$, at which $f$ is differentiable; applying step 4.1 at every point of a set $S \subseteq A$ on which $f$ is differentiable gives continuity of $f$ at every point of $S$. [step 3.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the work actually is.** None of it is here. Carathéodory's characterisation already replaces the quotient by a product, and a product is visibly small when one factor is bounded near $c$ and the other tends to $0$; the algebra of continuous functions packages exactly that. A direct proof from the quotient would multiply and divide by $x - c$ and would have to say why that is legal, which is the same observation in a less convenient place.

- **The converse fails.** $x \mapsto |x|$ is continuous at $0$ and not differentiable there, which is [[cex-absolute-value-is-not-differentiable-at-zero]] on the companion page. So continuity is strictly weaker, and the gap is not exotic: it opens at a single corner.

- **What is *not* claimed.** Nothing here says that a function differentiable on a set has a continuous derivative, and nothing here says that $f'$ is defined anywhere except where it was assumed to be. Both are separate questions, and neither is settled on this page.

## Statement

In any ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, the multiplicative identity
satisfies $0 < 1$; that is, $1 \in P$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$ and multiplicative identity $1$ ([[def-field]]).

[L1] In any field $1 \neq 0$ ([[def-field]]).

[L2] For every $x \neq 0$ the square satisfies $x^2 > 0$ ([[lem-of-square-positive]]).

[L3] The identity axiom gives $1 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1^2$ ([[def-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By the field axioms $1 \neq 0$, and $1 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1^2$. [L1, L3]

2.1 Since $1 \neq 0$, applying the square lemma with $x = 1$ gives $1^2 > 0$. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 Because $1 = 1^2$, it follows that $1 > 0$, i.e. $0 < 1$. [step 2.1, step 1.1, L3] ∎

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field with its order and
absolute value ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]), and
neighbourhoods are those of [[def-neighbourhood-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Then
$f$ is **continuous at $c$** when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

with $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ ranging over the **positive reals**. In the
language of neighbourhoods: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ with

$$f\bigl(A \cap N_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \;\subseteq\; N_{\varepsilon}\bigl(f(c)\bigr).$$

$f$ is **continuous on $A$** when it is continuous at every point of $A$.

**The point $c$ is required to lie in $A$, and the condition is unpunctured.**
Both differ from [[def-function-limit]], and deliberately. There the quantifier
runs over $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, which removes $x = c$; here $x = c$ is allowed,
and at $x = c$ the implication reads $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$, which is
automatic. So allowing $x = c$ costs nothing, and it is what lets the definition
be stated at every point of $A$, including the points where no limit exists.

**Three clauses, and all three are part of the definition.**

1. **At a limit point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is a limit point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]). Then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if the
   limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) \;=\; f(c)$$
   ([[def-function-limit]]). Indeed, for a given $\varepsilon > 0$ a $\delta$
   witnessing continuity witnesses the limit condition, because the limit
   condition quantifies over a subset of the points continuity quantifies over;
   and conversely a $\delta$ witnessing $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$ witnesses
   continuity, because the one point it omits, $x = c$, satisfies
   $|f(c) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ anyway.

2. **At an isolated point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is an isolated point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so that $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ for some real
   $\eta > 0$. Then **every** $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$: take
   $\delta := \eta$, so that the only $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ is $c$
   itself, and $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$.

3. **On a set.** Continuity on $A$ is continuity at each point of $A$, and
   nothing more. It is not a condition relating $f$ to points outside $A$.

Every point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$,
and never both ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so clauses 1 and 2 between them describe
continuity at every point of $A$.

**This is not the raw $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula of
[[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]].** That item records what goes
wrong when the *punctured* formula of [[def-function-limit]] is written down at
an arbitrary point of the domain: at an isolated point it is satisfied
vacuously by every real $L$ at once, so it defines nothing, and this library
therefore leaves $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ **undefined** at an isolated point.
Continuity at an isolated point is a different matter: the formula above is not
vacuous — it is a genuine condition on $f(c)$, satisfied because $f(c)$ is the
only value being compared with itself — and it names a single, well-defined
property. The limit is undefined there; the continuity is defined, and is
automatic. Clause 1 is the only place where the two notions meet, and it is
stated only where the limit exists as a notion.

**Where the distinction disappears.** If $A$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), then every $c \in A$ has some
$N_{\eta}(c) \subseteq A$, and a punctured neighbourhood is never empty
([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), so every point of $A$ is a limit point of $A$ and
clause 1 covers the whole of $A$. The same holds when $A$ is a nondegenerate
interval ([[def-interval]]). Isolated points are what force clause 2 to exist at
all, and they occur as soon as $A$ is allowed to be an arbitrary subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, as in $A = \{0\} \cup [1,2]$.

## Remarks

- **Continuity is local.** If $\eta > 0$ and $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agrees with
  $f$ on $A \cap N_{\eta}(c)$, then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if $g$
  is: any $\delta$ may be replaced by $\min\{\delta, \eta\}$, after which the
  condition only ever evaluates the two functions where they agree. So
  continuity at $c$ sees only an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of $c$, exactly
  as the limit does ([[lem-limit-is-local]]).

- **Continuity passes to subsets of the domain.** If $B \subseteq A$ and
  $c \in B$, then continuity of $f$ at $c$ gives continuity of the restriction
  $f|_B$ at $c$, with the same $\delta$: the condition on $f|_B$ quantifies over
  fewer points. The converse fails, and the standard witness is the indicator of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ restricted to $\mathbb{Q}$, which is constant and hence
  continuous, while the indicator itself is continuous nowhere
  ([[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]]).

- **The radius is a real number.** As in [[def-neighbourhood-r]], $\varepsilon$
  and $\delta$ range over the positive reals here. Restricting either quantifier
  to the positive rationals defines the same relation, by the passage recorded
  in [[def-function-limit]]: below every positive real lies a positive rational
  ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and a real $\delta$ may be shrunk to a rational
  one below it.

- **The word *continuous* is used for two things in this library, and they
  agree.** [[def-metric-continuity]] defines continuity of a map between metric
  spaces, and $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ carries the metric $d(x,y) = |x-y|$. The
  two notions coincide, and that is proved, not assumed:
  [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]] is the dictionary, and it is stated on
  this page precisely so that no later item has to guess.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), neighbourhoods are those of
[[def-neighbourhood-r]] and limit points those of [[def-limit-point-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$ be a
**limit point of $A$**. The **difference quotient of $f$ at $c$** is the function

$$q_{f,c} : A \setminus \{c\} \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad q_{f,c}(x) := \frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c} .$$

The division is legitimate at every point of the domain, since $x \ne c$ gives
$x - c \ne 0$.

**The point $c$ is a limit point of $A \setminus \{c\}$, not merely of $A$.**
For every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the punctured neighbourhood
$N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c)$ omits $c$, so

$$N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c) \cap A \;=\; N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c) \cap (A \setminus \{c\}) ,$$

and the left-hand side is nonempty because $c$ is a limit point of $A$. So
$q_{f,c}$ is a function on a set having $c$ as a limit point, and
$\lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x)$ is a notion that [[def-function-limit]] defines.

$f$ is **differentiable at $c$** when that limit exists, and then the
**derivative of $f$ at $c$** is

$$f'(c) \;:=\; \lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x) \;=\; \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c} .$$

**Two obligations are carried by that notation, and both are discharged here.**

1. **Uniqueness.** Writing $f'(c)$ treats the right-hand side as a name for a
   single real number. That is legitimate: $c$ is a limit point of the domain
   $A \setminus \{c\}$ of $q_{f,c}$, so at most one real can satisfy the
   $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ condition, by [[lem-function-limit-unique]] applied to
   $q_{f,c}$. Two reals both meeting the condition are therefore equal, and the
   symbol denotes.
2. **Meaningfulness.** The hypothesis that $c$ is a limit point of $A$ is not
   decoration. At an **isolated** point of $A$ the punctured condition
   $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ is met by no point of the domain at all, so the
   $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula is satisfied vacuously by *every* real at
   once; this is why [[def-function-limit]] leaves the limit undefined there,
   and it is why this library defines $f'(c)$ only at a limit point of $A$. At
   an isolated point of its domain a function is neither differentiable nor
   non-differentiable here: the question is not posed.

**The limit sees only $A \setminus \{c\}$, so how the difference quotient is
extended to $c$ is irrelevant.** Let $Q : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agree with
$q_{f,c}$ at every point of $A \setminus \{c\}$, and let $L \in \mathbb{R}$.
Then $\lim_{x \to c} Q(x) = L$ if and only if $\lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x) = L$.
Both conditions read: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ such that every point $x$ of the relevant domain with
$0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|{\cdot} - L| < \varepsilon$
([[def-function-limit]]). The clause $0 < |x - c|$ removes $x = c$ from both
quantifiers, so in both cases the points quantified over are exactly the
$x \in A \setminus \{c\}$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, at which $Q$ and
$q_{f,c}$ take the same value. The two conditions are the same condition.

**Differentiability on a set.** For $S \subseteq A$, $f$ is **differentiable on
$S$** when it is differentiable at every $c \in S$; implicit in that phrase is
that every point of $S$ is a limit point of $A$. $f$ is **differentiable** when
it is differentiable on the whole of $A$.

**Restriction of the domain.** Let $B \subseteq A$, let $c \in B$ and suppose
$c$ is a limit point of $B$. If $f$ is differentiable at $c$, then so is the
restriction $f|_B : B \to \mathbb{R}$, and

$$(f|_B)'(c) \;=\; f'(c) .$$

Indeed $B \setminus \{c\} \subseteq A \setminus \{c\}$; the displayed identity
of punctured neighbourhoods above, applied to $B$, shows that $c$ is a limit
point of $B \setminus \{c\}$; the difference quotient $q_{f|_B, c}$ is the
restriction of $q_{f,c}$ to $B \setminus \{c\}$, since $f|_B(c) = f(c)$; and
claim 2 of [[lem-limit-is-local]] carries the limit to that restriction.

**Every point of a nondegenerate interval is a limit point of it.** Let
$J \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be order-convex ([[def-interval]]) with at least two
elements and let $p \in J$. Choose $q \in J$ with $q \ne p$, and let a real
$\varepsilon > 0$ be given. If $p < q$, put $y := p + \tfrac{1}{2}\min\{\varepsilon,\ q - p\}$;
then $p < y$, and $y - p \le \tfrac{1}{2}(q-p) < q - p$, so $p < y < q$ and
order-convexity gives $y \in J$, while $0 < |y - p| < \varepsilon$. If $q < p$,
the point $y := p - \tfrac{1}{2}\min\{\varepsilon,\ p - q\}$ serves in the same
way. So $N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(p) \cap J \ne \varnothing$ for every real
$\varepsilon > 0$, that is, $p$ is a limit point of $J$
([[def-limit-point-r]]).

Consequently, for $f$ defined on a nondegenerate interval $I$, the symbol
$f'(c)$ is meaningful at **every** $c \in I$, endpoints included. At an endpoint
the difference quotient is taken over the points of $I$ lying on the one side
that is available, so what other texts call a one-sided derivative is, here,
simply the derivative of $f$ on $I$.

## Remarks

- **Notation.** $f'(c)$ and $\frac{df}{dx}(c)$ denote the same real number, and
  this library uses the first. Neither is an operation performed on a symbol
  $x$: the variable in the second is a name for the argument and nothing more.

- **Differentiability is a property of the pair $(f, A)$ at $c$, not of $f$
  alone.** The restriction clause above goes in one direction only, and the
  converse fails. Take $A := \mathbb{R}$, $f(x) := |x|$, $B := [0,\infty)$ and
  $c := 0$. Then $f|_B$ is the identity on $B$, whose difference quotient at $0$
  is constantly $1$, so $f|_B$ is differentiable at $0$ with derivative $1$;
  that $f$ itself is not differentiable at $0$ is
  [[cex-absolute-value-is-not-differentiable-at-zero]] on the companion page.
  So enlarging the domain can destroy differentiability, and the phrase
  "$f$ is differentiable at $c$" always carries the domain with it.

- **The relation to continuity is not definitional.** [[def-continuity-real]]
  is a condition on $f$ near $c$ that does not mention a quotient, and it is
  defined at every point of $A$, isolated points included, whereas
  differentiability is defined only at limit points of $A$. That
  differentiability implies continuity is a theorem on this page and not a
  reading of the definitions.

- **No second derivative and no one-sided derivative is introduced here.**
  Both are standard, and both are absent from this page on purpose;
  [[rem-derivative-conventions]] records exactly what is fixed and what is left
  open at this point in the reading order.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) with its order and absolute value
([[def-real-order]]).

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$, let $c \in \mathbb{R}$
be a **limit point** of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and let $L \in \mathbb{R}$.
We say that **$f(x)$ tends to $L$ as $x$ tends to $c$**, and write

$$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L ,$$

when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ 0 < |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - L| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

where $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ range over the **positive reals**.

In the language of neighbourhoods ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]) the condition reads:
for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ with

$$f\bigl(A \cap N^{*}_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \;\subseteq\; N_{\varepsilon}(L),$$

$N^{*}_{\delta}(c) = \{\, y : 0 < |y - c| < \delta \,\}$ being the punctured
$\delta$-neighbourhood of $c$ and $N_{\varepsilon}(L) = (L - \varepsilon,\ L +
\varepsilon)$ the open interval of [[def-interval]]. The two forms agree because
$|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ says exactly $f(x) \in N_\varepsilon(L)$, and
$0 < |x - c| < \delta$ says exactly $x \in N^{*}_\delta(c)$.

**Three features of this definition are load bearing, not decoration.**

1. **$c$ is required to be a limit point of $A$.** By [[def-limit-point-r]] that
   says every punctured neighbourhood of $c$ meets $A$, so for every $\delta > 0$
   the set $A \cap N^{*}_\delta(c)$ over which the implication quantifies is
   nonempty. Drop the requirement and the implication can be satisfied
   vacuously by *every* real $L$ at once, which is exactly what
   [[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]] records. At a point of $A$
   that is not a limit point of $A$ — an isolated point — the symbol
   $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ is therefore **not defined** in this library.

2. **$c \in A$ is not required.** A limit point of $A$ need not belong to $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and the definition never evaluates $f$ at $c$. This
   is what allows a limit to be taken at a point where the function is not
   defined at all, as at $0$ for $x \mapsto x\,\psi(1/x)$.

3. **The value $f(c)$, when it exists, is irrelevant.** The hypothesis
   $0 < |x - c|$ excludes $x = c$ from the quantifier, so changing $f$ at the
   single point $c$ changes nothing. Equality of the limit with the value is an
   extra condition, not a consequence: [[fs-limit-equals-value]].

**The notation presumes uniqueness.** Writing $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$ treats
the left-hand side as a name for a single real number, which is legitimate only
because at a limit point at most one $L$ can satisfy the displayed condition.
That obligation is discharged by [[lem-function-limit-unique]], recorded in this
item's `justified_by`. As with $\sup S$ ([[rem-sup-conventions]]) and
$\lim_k x_k$ ([[lem-limit-unique]]), the symbol is written only for a function
already known to have a limit at $c$.

**Real and rational $\varepsilon$ define the same relation.** Above,
$\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ range over the positive reals. Restricting either
quantifier to the positive rationals gives the same relation: every positive
rational is a positive real, and below every positive real lies a positive
rational ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), so an $\varepsilon$-condition verified for
all positive rationals is verified for an arbitrary positive real $\eta$ by
running it at a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, and a
$\delta$ produced as a real may be shrunk to a rational one below it. This is
the passage sanctioned in the remarks of [[def-sequence]], and it is what lets
this definition be compared with [[def-real-limit]], whose $\varepsilon$ is
rational, in [[thm-sequential-criterion-for-function-limits]].

## Remarks

- **Terminology.** *Limit point* here is a property of the set $A$ and the point
  $c$, in the sense of [[def-limit-point-r]]; it has nothing to do with
  subsequential limits ([[def-subsequential-limit]]), and the distinction is the
  one that item records.

- **Why the punctured condition, and not $|x - c| < \delta$.** With the
  unpunctured condition the definition would force $f$ to be defined at $c$ and
  would force $|f(c) - L| < \varepsilon$ for every $\varepsilon$, that is,
  $L = f(c)$. The resulting notion is continuity at $c$, a strictly stronger
  condition, and conflating the two is the error catalogued in
  [[fs-limit-equals-value]].

- **One-sided and infinite variants.** Restricting the domain to one side of $c$
  gives the one-sided limits of [[def-one-sided-limits]]; replacing the
  conditions on $x$ or on $f(x)$ by unboundedness conditions gives the limits at
  and to infinity of [[def-limits-at-infinity]]. Both are built on this
  definition rather than beside it.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]] and closure as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]].

- $x$ is an **adherent point** of $A$ when $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne
  \varnothing$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$.
- $x$ is a **limit point** (or *accumulation point*) of $A$ when
  $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every real
  $\varepsilon > 0$: every punctured neighbourhood of $x$ meets $A$.
- $x$ is an **isolated point** of $A$ when $x \in A$ and there is a real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$.
- The **derived set** of $A$ is
  $$A' \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \text{ is a limit point of } A \,\}.$$
- $A$ is **dense in $\mathbb{R}$** when $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$.

**A limit point is an adherent point**, since $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq
N_\varepsilon(x)$; and an element of $A$ is an adherent point of $A$, since
$x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). So the adherent
points of $A$ are exactly the points of $A \cup A'$, a statement proved as part
of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

**Limit point and isolated point are exact opposites inside $A$.** For
$x \in A$: $x$ is an isolated point of $A$ exactly when it is not a limit point
of $A$. Indeed $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$ says precisely that
$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, because $x$ itself always lies in
$N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ when $x \in A$; so the existence of an $\varepsilon$
witnessing isolation is the negation of the condition defining a limit point.
A point of $A$ is therefore either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$, and
never both.

**A limit point need not belong to the set, and a point of the set need not be a
limit point.** Both possibilities occur, and the two examples that matter later
are $0$, which is a limit point of $\{\, 1/k : k \ge 1 \,\}$ without belonging
to it, and $0$ again, which belongs to $\{0\} \cup [1,2]$ as an isolated point.

## Remarks

- **Terminology: *limit point* here is about a set, never about a sequence.**
  This library reserves *subsequential limit* for the sequential notion
  ([[def-subsequential-limit]]), and the two are genuinely different: the
  constant sequence $x_k = 0$ has $0$ as a subsequential limit, while its set of
  values $\{0\}$ has no limit point at all. The distinction is the one
  [[def-subsequential-limit]] records under "Terminology", and it is respected
  throughout this page.

- **Density is defined through the closure, not through intervals.** Saying
  $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$ is equivalent to saying that every nonempty open
  subset of $\mathbb{R}$ meets $A$, and also to saying that every neighbourhood
  of every real meets $A$; the equivalences follow from
  [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] and are used in that form in
  [[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]].

- **The derived set need not be comparable with the set.** It can be strictly
  larger, as for $\mathbb{Q}$: every punctured neighbourhood of any real
  contains a rational, since density supplies one strictly between $x$ and
  $x + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]), so the derived set of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is all of $\mathbb{R}$. It can be strictly smaller, as for
  $\{0\}$, whose derived set is empty; and it can be neither, as for
  $\{0\} \cup (1,2)$, whose derived set is $[1,2]$, a set containing points
  outside the original and omitting the point $0$ of it. A closed set satisfying
  $A \subseteq A'$ is called perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]).

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]) and its absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]).

Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ with
$\varepsilon > 0$. The **$\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\},$$

and the **punctured $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \;=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}.$$

The two descriptions of $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ agree because $|y - x| = 0$ holds
exactly when $y = x$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**A neighbourhood is an open interval.** For every $x$ and every
$\varepsilon > 0$,

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;=\; (x - \varepsilon,\ x + \varepsilon),$$

the interval of [[def-interval]]. Indeed [[lem-of-abs-value]] gives, for
$\varepsilon > 0$, the equivalence $|y - x| < \varepsilon \iff -\varepsilon <
y - x < \varepsilon$, and adding $x$ throughout turns the right-hand side into
$x - \varepsilon < y < x + \varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**The centre lies in its own neighbourhoods.** $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, since
$|x - x| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**Punctured neighbourhoods are never empty.** The element
$y := x + \varepsilon/2$ satisfies $|y - x| = \varepsilon/2$, which is
$> 0$ and $< \varepsilon$, so $y \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$
([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

**Monotonicity in the radius.** If $0 < \delta \le \varepsilon$ then
$N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, because $|y - x| < \delta \le
\varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**Nesting at an interior point.** If $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and
$0 < \delta \le \varepsilon - |y - x|$, then

$$N_\delta(y) \;\subseteq\; N_\varepsilon(x).$$

Indeed for $z \in N_\delta(y)$ the triangle inequality
([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]) gives
$|z - x| = |(z - y) + (y - x)| \le |z - y| + |y - x| < \delta + |y - x| \le
\varepsilon$. Note that $\varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ precisely because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, so such a $\delta$ always exists.

## Remarks

- **The radius is a real number, not a rational.** Nothing on this page tests a
  condition against rational radii only. That convention belongs to
  [[def-real-limit]], where the quantifier is over rational $\varepsilon$ and
  the passage between the rational and the real form is the sanctioned remark of
  [[def-sequence]]. Here $\varepsilon$ ranges over the positive reals
  throughout, and every statement above is proved for an arbitrary positive
  real.

- **Why the punctured version is separated out.** A limit point of a set is a
  point every punctured neighbourhood of which meets the set
  ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and deleting the centre is exactly what stops a point
  of the set from qualifying automatically. The unpunctured condition defines
  the weaker notion of an adherent point, and the difference between the two is
  precisely an isolated point.

- **Nesting is the workhorse.** Almost every openness verification on this page
  has the shape "given $y$ in the set, shrink the radius by the distance
  already travelled", which is the nesting property above. It is recorded here
  once so that no later proof has to redo the triangle inequality in passing.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in
\mathbb{R}$. Put

$$A^{-} := A \cap (-\infty, c), \qquad A^{+} := A \cap (c, \infty)$$

([[def-interval]]), and write $f^{-} := f|_{A^{-}}$ and $f^{+} := f|_{A^{+}}$
for the restrictions of $f$ to those sets.

**Right limit.** Suppose $c$ is a limit point of $A^{+}$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]).
For $L \in \mathbb{R}$ we write

$$\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x) = L \quad :\Longleftrightarrow \quad \lim_{x \to c} f^{+}(x) = L$$

in the sense of [[def-function-limit]]. Written out: for every real
$\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that

$$|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon \qquad \text{for every } x \in A \text{ with } c < x < c + \delta .$$

**Left limit.** Suppose $c$ is a limit point of $A^{-}$. For $L \in \mathbb{R}$
we write $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) = L$ when $\lim_{x \to c} f^{-}(x) = L$; written
out, for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ with
$|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ for every $x \in A$ with $c - \delta < x < c$.

**The written-out forms agree with the definitions.** For $x \in A^{+}$ the two
conditions $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ and $c < x < c + \delta$ are the same: $x > c$
gives $x - c > 0$, so $|x - c| = x - c$ and $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ reads
$0 < x - c < \delta$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]). Symmetrically on the left, where
$x < c$ gives $|x - c| = c - x$.

**Well-posedness is inherited, not reproved.** A one-sided limit *is* a limit,
namely the limit of a restriction, so:

- **Uniqueness.** At most one $L$ can occur, by [[lem-function-limit-unique]]
  applied to $f^{+}$ on the domain $A^{+}$ (respectively to $f^{-}$ on
  $A^{-}$), which is legitimate exactly because $c$ was required to be a limit
  point of that set. This is what makes the notation $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$
  denote a single real.
- **Locality and restriction.** Both claims of [[lem-limit-is-local]] apply
  verbatim to $f^{+}$ and $f^{-}$.

**When the symbols are defined.** If $c$ is not a limit point of $A^{+}$ — for
instance if $A$ contains no point to the right of $c$, or only points bounded
away from $c$ on that side — then $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$ is **not defined**
here, for the reason given in [[def-function-limit]]: the
$\varepsilon$-$\delta$ condition would be satisfied vacuously by every real at
once. The same applies on the left.

## Remarks

- **Neither one-sided limit requires $c \in A$, and neither looks at $f(c)$.**
  Both properties are inherited from [[def-function-limit]], since $c \notin
  A^{-} \cup A^{+}$: the point $c$ belongs to neither $(-\infty, c)$ nor
  $(c, \infty)$.

- **The two one-sided limits and the two-sided limit.** When $c$ is a limit
  point of both $A^{-}$ and $A^{+}$, the two-sided limit exists exactly when
  both one-sided limits exist and agree, and then all three coincide:
  [[thm-two-sided-limit-iff-both-one-sided]]. When $c$ is a limit point of only
  one of the two sets, that one-sided limit and the two-sided limit are the same
  condition, again by claim 2 of [[lem-limit-is-local]] together with the
  observation that $A$ and that one side have the same points in a small enough
  punctured neighbourhood of $c$.

- **Notation.** Some texts write $f(c+)$ and $f(c-)$ for these values. This
  library writes only $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$ and $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x)$,
  because the shorter notation looks like an evaluation of $f$ and these
  quantities are not values of $f$: they are defined without reference to
  $f(c)$, which may not even exist.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$, let $c$ be a limit
point of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]) and let $L, L' \in \mathbb{R}$. If

$$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L \qquad \text{and} \qquad \lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L'$$

([[def-function-limit]]), then $L = L'$.

A function therefore has **at most one** limit at a limit point of its domain,
which is what licenses the notation $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ for a single real
number. This lemma is recorded in the `justified_by` field of
[[def-function-limit]] for exactly that reason.

**The hypothesis that $c$ is a limit point is not removable.** At an isolated
point of the domain the same $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula is satisfied
vacuously by every real at once, which is the content of
[[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$, a limit point $c$ of $A$, and reals $L, L'$ with $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$ and $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L'$ ([[def-function-limit]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L1] The limit condition: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$, and likewise with $L'$ in place of $L$ ([[def-function-limit]]).

[L2] Limit point: for every real $\delta > 0$ there is $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] Triangle inequality: $|u + v| \le |u| + |v|$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L4] Absolute value: $|u| \ge 0$; $|u| = 0$ if and only if $u = 0$; and $|-u| = |u|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L5] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: trichotomy, so $u \ne 0$ together with $|u| \ge 0$ and $|u| \ne 0$ forces $|u| > 0$, and $t < t$ is impossible; adding two strict inequalities ([[lem-of-add-order]]); $0 < 1$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]), hence $2 := 1 + 1 > 0$ and $2^{-1} > 0$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]), so $\eta/2 > 0$ and $(\eta/2) \cdot 2 = \eta$ whenever $\eta > 0$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]]); and of two positive reals the smaller is positive, the order being total.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $L \ne L'$. [assume-contra]

2.1 Then $L - L' \ne 0$, so $|L - L'| \ne 0$ while $|L - L'| \ge 0$, and trichotomy gives $|L - L'| > 0$; hence $\varepsilon := |L - L'|/2 > 0$ and $2\varepsilon = |L - L'|$. [step 1.1, L4, L5]

3.1 Applying [L1] twice with this $\varepsilon$, fix reals $\delta_1 > 0$ and $\delta_2 > 0$ such that every $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta_1$ has $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ and every $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta_2$ has $|f(x) - L'| < \varepsilon$; put $\delta$ to be the smaller of $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$, so $\delta > 0$. [step 2.1, L1, L5, choose]

4.1 Since $c$ is a limit point of $A$, fix $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$. [step 3.1, L2, choose]

5.1 That $x$ satisfies $0 < |x - c| < \delta_1$ and $0 < |x - c| < \delta_2$, hence both $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ and $|f(x) - L'| < \varepsilon$. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L1]

6.1 Therefore $|L - L'| = |(L - f(x)) + (f(x) - L')| \le |L - f(x)| + |f(x) - L'| = |f(x) - L| + |f(x) - L'| < \varepsilon + \varepsilon = 2\varepsilon = |L - L'|$. [step 5.1, L3, L4, L5]

7.1 So $|L - L'| < |L - L'|$, which trichotomy forbids; the assumption $L \ne L'$ is untenable, and hence $L = L'$. [step 6.1, L5, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where each hypothesis is spent.** The limit conditions are used only in step 5.1, and the limit-point hypothesis only in step 4.1, to produce a *single* point $x$ of the domain near $c$ at which both estimates can be read. Without such a point the two estimates never meet and nothing forces $L = L'$; that is the whole mechanism, and it is the reason [[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]] is false.

- **The sequential analogue** is [[lem-limit-unique]], proved by the same two-estimates-at-one-index argument. Neither statement uses any choice principle.

- **One-sided limits inherit this.** By [[def-one-sided-limits]] a one-sided limit is the limit of a restriction of $f$, so applying this lemma to that restriction gives uniqueness there too; nothing has to be reproved.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$, with
$|x|$ the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]). Then

$$|x| \ge 0; \quad |x| = 0 \iff x = 0; \quad -|x| \le x \le |x|; \quad |-x| = |x|; \quad |xy| = |x|\,|y|;$$

and, for every $c > 0$, one has $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and elements $x, y \in F$.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| = u$ if $u \ge 0$, and $|u| = -u$ if $u < 0$ ([[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Ordered-field order: trichotomy holds (for each $u$ exactly one of $u > 0$, $u = 0$, $u < 0$), $a < b$ means $b - a$ is positive, and sums and products of positives are positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Signs in products: $(-a)b = -(ab)$ and $(-a)(-b) = ab$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] Sign rules: a product of two elements of the same sign is positive, and a product of two elements of opposite sign is negative ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Case $x > 0$: by [L1] $|x| = x > 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; since $-x < 0$ we get $|-x| = -(-x) = x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -x < 0 < x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case pos, L1, L2, algebra]

1.2 Case $x = 0$: then $|x| = |0| = 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ holds with $|x| = 0$ and $x = 0$, while $|-x| = |0| = |x|$ and $-|x| = 0 \le 0 \le 0 = |x|$. [assume-case zero, L1]

1.3 Case $x < 0$: by [L1] $|x| = -x$, and [L2] gives $-x > 0$, so $|x| > 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; here $|-x| = -x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -(-x) = x \le x$ while $x < 0 < -x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case neg, L1, L2, algebra]

1.4 Case $x = 0$ or $y = 0$: then $xy = 0$, so $|xy| = 0$, and one of $|x|, |y|$ is $0$, whence $|x|\,|y| = 0 = |xy|$. [assume-case zerofactor, L1]

1.5 Case $x, y$ have the same sign (both positive or both negative): by [L4] $xy > 0$, so $|xy| = xy$, while $|x|\,|y| = xy$ by [L3] (for $x, y < 0$ this is $(-x)(-y) = xy$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case same, L1, L3, L4]

1.6 Case $x, y$ have opposite signs (one positive, one negative): by [L4] $xy < 0$, so $|xy| = -(xy)$, while $|x|\,|y| = -(xy)$ by [L3] (namely $x(-y)$ or $(-x)y$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case opposite, L1, L3, L4]

2.1 By trichotomy [L2] each $x$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.1-1.3, and in each we verified $|x| \ge 0$, that $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$, that $|-x| = |x|$, and that $-|x| \le x \le |x|$; hence all four hold for every $x$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, cases-exhaustive]

2.2 By trichotomy [L2] each pair $x, y$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.4-1.6, and in each $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$ for all $x, y$. [step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6, cases-exhaustive]

3.1 Let $c > 0$: if $|x| < c$ then $-c < -|x| \le x \le |x| < c$ by [step 2.1] and [L2], so $-c < x < c$; conversely if $-c < x < c$ then both $x < c$ and $-x < c$, and since $|x|$ equals $x$ or $-x$ by [L1], we get $|x| < c$, so $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$. [step 2.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$, let
$\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Suppose $f$ and $g$ are continuous at
$c$ ([[def-continuity-real]]). Then:

1. $f + g$, $\alpha f$ and $fg$ are continuous at $c$;
2. $|f|$, the function $x \mapsto |f(x)|$, is continuous at $c$;
3. $\max\{f,g\}$ and $\min\{f,g\}$, defined pointwise by
   $x \mapsto \max\{f(x), g(x)\}$ and $x \mapsto \min\{f(x), g(x)\}$
   ([[def-max-min]]), are continuous at $c$;
4. if $g(c) \ne 0$ then, writing $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$, the
   point $c$ lies in $A_0$ and the quotient
   $(f/g)|_{A_0} : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$, $x \mapsto f(x)/g(x)$, is continuous at
   $c$ as a function on $A_0$.

Moreover, with no hypothesis at all:

5. every constant function $A \to \mathbb{R}$ and the identity
   $\mathrm{id} : A \to \mathbb{R}$, $x \mapsto x$, are continuous on $A$; hence
   so is $x \mapsto x^{n}$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$
   ([[def-integer-power]]), and hence so is every **polynomial function**
   $x \mapsto a_0 + a_1 x + \dots + a_n x^{n}$ with real coefficients.

Consequently, if $f$ and $g$ are continuous **on** $A$ then so are $f+g$,
$\alpha f$, $fg$, $|f|$, $\max\{f,g\}$ and $\min\{f,g\}$, and
$(f/g)|_{A_0}$ is continuous on $A_0$.

**Claim 4 is stated on $A_0$ because $f/g$ is not defined where $g$ vanishes**,
and $g$ may well vanish at points of $A$ far from $c$. The hypothesis is
$g(c) \ne 0$, not "$g$ nowhere zero"; what it buys is that $c$ itself lies in
the smaller domain, which is what makes continuity there mean anything.

**Nothing here is proved through a sequence.** Claims 1 and 4 are read off from
[[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]], which is itself proved from $\varepsilon$
and $\delta$, and claims 2, 3 and 5 are proved directly below. So no choice
principle is used anywhere in this item.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, functions $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\alpha$, a point $c \in A$ at which $f$ and $g$ are continuous, and, for claim 4, the hypothesis $g(c) \ne 0$ together with $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$.

[L1] Continuity at $c$: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L2] A point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$, and never both; at an isolated point of its domain every function is continuous; at a limit point $c$ of $A$, continuity of $f$ at $c$ is exactly the statement that the limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and equals $f(c)$ ([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-function-limit]]).

[L3] Algebra of function limits at a limit point $c$ of $A$: if the limits of $f$ and $g$ at $c$ exist with values $L$ and $M$, then the limits of $f+g$, $\alpha f$ and $fg$ at $c$ exist with values $L+M$, $\alpha L$ and $LM$; and if $M \ne 0$ then $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$, and the limit of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$ exists and equals $L/M$ ([[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]]).

[L4] Sign preservation: if the limit of $g$ at a limit point $c$ of $A$ exists and is nonzero, then $c$ is a limit point of $A_0 = \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$ ([[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]]).

[L5] Reverse triangle inequality: $\bigl||u| - |v|\bigr| \le |u - v|$ ([[cor-of-reverse-triangle]]); and $|u| \ge 0$, $|u| = 0$ exactly when $u = 0$, $|uv| = |u||v|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L6] Maximum and minimum of a two-element set of reals exist ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]), and for all reals $u, v$ one has $\max\{u,v\} = \tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(u + v + |u-v|\bigr)$ and $\min\{u,v\} = \tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(u + v - |u-v|\bigr)$.

[L7] Ordered-field arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: trichotomy and totality of the order, the field identities, and $0 < 1$ so that $2 \ne 0$ and $t/2$ is defined ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]).

[L8] Integer powers: $a^{0} = 1$ and $a^{n+1} = a^{n} \cdot a$ ([[def-integer-power]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Justification of the identity in [L6].** Let $u, v \in \mathbb{R}$. By totality either $u \ge v$ or $v \ge u$. If $u \ge v$ then $u - v \ge 0$, so $|u-v| = u-v$ and $\tfrac{1}{2}(u+v+|u-v|) = \tfrac{1}{2}(2u) = u = \max\{u,v\}$, while $\tfrac{1}{2}(u+v-|u-v|) = v = \min\{u,v\}$. If $v \ge u$ the same computation with the roles exchanged applies, since $|u-v| = v-u$ there. [L5, L6, L7]

1.2 **The isolated case.** Suppose $c$ is an isolated point of $A$, say $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ with $\eta > 0$ real. Then every function on $A$ is continuous at $c$ by [L2], which gives claims 1, 2 and 3 at once. For claim 4, assume $g(c) \ne 0$; then $c \in A_0$, and $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A_0 \subseteq N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ with $c$ in the left-hand side, so $c$ is an isolated point of $A_0$ and every function on $A_0$, in particular $(f/g)|_{A_0}$, is continuous at $c$. [L2]

1.3 **Claim 2, at any point of $A$.** Let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given and let $\delta > 0$ be as in [L1] for $f$ and this $\varepsilon$. For $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ the reverse triangle inequality gives $\bigl||f(x)| - |f(c)|\bigr| \le |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$. So $|f|$ is continuous at $c$, and no case distinction was needed. [L1, L5]

1.4 **Claim 5, constants and the identity.** If $f$ is constant then $|f(x) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$ for every $x \in A$ and every real $\varepsilon > 0$, so any $\delta > 0$ serves. For the identity, given a real $\varepsilon > 0$ take $\delta := \varepsilon$: every $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ has $|\mathrm{id}(x) - \mathrm{id}(c)| = |x - c| < \varepsilon$. Both are continuous at every point of $A$. [L1, L5, L7]

1.5 **The limit-point case, claim 1.** Suppose $c$ is a limit point of $A$. By [L2] the limits of $f$ and of $g$ at $c$ exist and equal $f(c)$ and $g(c)$. By [L3] the limits of $f+g$, $\alpha f$ and $fg$ at $c$ exist and equal $f(c)+g(c)$, $\alpha f(c)$ and $f(c)g(c)$, which are exactly the values of those three functions at $c$; by [L2] again, each of them is continuous at $c$. [L2, L3]

1.6 **The limit-point case, claim 4.** Suppose $c$ is a limit point of $A$ and $g(c) \ne 0$. Then $c \in A_0$, and by [L4] the point $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$. By [L3] the limit of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$ exists and equals $f(c)/g(c)$, which is the value of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$; by [L2] applied on the domain $A_0$, that function is continuous at $c$. [L2, L3, L4]

2.1 **Claims 1 and 4 in general.** By [L2] the point $c$ is either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$; step 1.2 settles the first case and steps 1.5 and 1.6 the second. So claims 1 and 4 hold as stated. [step 1.2, step 1.5, step 1.6, L2]

3.1 **Claim 3.** By claim 1 the function $f - g = f + (-1)g$ is continuous at $c$, by step 1.3 so is $|f-g|$, and by claim 1 again so are $f + g + |f-g|$ and its scalar multiple by $1/2$. By step 1.1 that scalar multiple is the function $x \mapsto \max\{f(x), g(x)\}$, so the maximum is continuous at $c$; the same argument with $-|f-g|$ gives the minimum. [step 1.1, step 1.3, step 2.1, L6, L7]

3.2 **Claim 5, powers and polynomials.** The map $x \mapsto x^{0}$ is the constant $1$ and $x \mapsto x^{1}$ is the identity, both continuous on $A$ by step 1.4; and if $x \mapsto x^{n}$ is continuous on $A$ then so is $x \mapsto x^{n+1} = x^{n} \cdot x$, being a product of two functions continuous on $A$ by step 2.1. By induction on $n$, $x \mapsto x^{n}$ is continuous on $A$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. A polynomial function $a_0 + a_1x + \dots + a_nx^{n}$ is obtained from these by finitely many scalar multiplications and additions, each of which preserves continuity by step 2.1. [step 1.4, step 2.1, L8]

4.1 Claims 1 to 5 are proved, all of them at an arbitrary point $c$ of $A$ and therefore, applied at every point, on the whole of $A$; and no sequence and no choice principle was used. [step 1.3, step 2.1, step 3.1, step 3.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the two-case shape, and why it is not an inconvenience.** Continuity is defined at every point of the domain, including isolated points, where no limit exists ([[def-continuity-real]]). The algebra of limits therefore cannot be applied blindly; but at an isolated point every function is continuous, so the case is settled before it is opened. Claims 2 and 5 are proved directly from $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ and need no case distinction at all.

- **Absolute value, maximum and minimum are not in [[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]]**, and the reason is that they are not needed there. They are needed here: the extreme value theorem and the one-dimensional fixed point theorem both build auxiliary functions out of maxima, minima and differences, and [[thm-compactness-is-necessary-for-evt-and-uniform-continuity]] builds its witnesses out of $|x - x_0|$ and quotients.

- **The converse of claim 2 is false**: $|f|$ may be continuous while $f$ is continuous nowhere. The function equal to $1$ on $\mathbb{Q}$ and to $-1$ elsewhere has constant absolute value; that it is nowhere continuous follows from the argument of [[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]] applied verbatim, since that argument uses only that the two values are distinct.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in
\mathbb{R}$ be a limit point of **both** $A^{-} = A \cap (-\infty, c)$ and
$A^{+} = A \cap (c, \infty)$ ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-interval]]), so that
both one-sided limits at $c$ are well posed ([[def-one-sided-limits]]). Then $c$
is a limit point of $A$, and for every $L \in \mathbb{R}$:

$$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) = L \ \text{ and } \ \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x) = L$$

([[def-function-limit]]). Consequently the limit of $f$ at $c$ **exists** if and
only if both one-sided limits exist and are equal, and in that case

$$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) \;=\; \lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) \;=\; \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x) .$$

**The hypothesis on both sides is what makes the statement an equivalence.** If
$c$ is a limit point of only one of the two sets — as $1$ is for
$\{0\} \cup [1,2]$ — then the one-sided limit on that side and the two-sided
limit are the same condition, and the symbol on the other side is not defined at
all ([[def-one-sided-limits]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $c$ that is a limit point of both $A^{-} = A \cap (-\infty, c)$ and $A^{+} = A \cap (c, \infty)$, and a real $L$ ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-interval]], [[def-one-sided-limits]]).

[L1] The limit condition ([[def-function-limit]]): $\lim_{x \to c} h(x) = L$ means that for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x$ in the domain of $h$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|h(x) - L| < \varepsilon$.

[L2] Limit point: $c$ is a limit point of $S$ when for every real $\delta > 0$ there is $x \in S$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] Intervals: $A^{-} = \{\, x \in A : x < c \,\}$ and $A^{+} = \{\, x \in A : x > c \,\}$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L4] Absolute value and order: $|x - c| = 0$ exactly when $x = c$; the order is total, so every $x \ne c$ satisfies $x < c$ or $x > c$; and $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ is equivalent to $c - \delta < x < c$ for $x < c$ and to $c < x < c + \delta$ for $x > c$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]]). Of two positive reals the smaller is positive.

[L5] Restriction: if $B \subseteq A$ has $c$ as a limit point and $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$, then $\lim_{x \to c} f|_B(x) = L$ (claim 2 of [[lem-limit-is-local]]).

[L6] One-sided limits are by definition the limits of the restrictions $f|_{A^{-}}$ and $f|_{A^{+}}$ at $c$ ([[def-one-sided-limits]]).

[L7] At a limit point of its domain a function has at most one limit ([[lem-function-limit-unique]]); applied to $f|_{A^{-}}$ and to $f|_{A^{+}}$ it makes each one-sided limit a single real, and applied to $f$ it does the same for the two-sided limit.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $c$ is a limit point of $A$: it is one of $A^{+}$ by hypothesis, and $A^{+} \subseteq A$, so every point of $A^{+}$ found in a punctured neighbourhood of $c$ is a point of $A$ there. [L2, L3]

1.2 For $x \in A$ the condition $0 < |x - c|$ says exactly $x \ne c$, and then $x < c$ or $x > c$, that is $x \in A^{-}$ or $x \in A^{+}$; moreover for $x \in A^{-}$ the condition $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ reads $c - \delta < x < c$ and for $x \in A^{+}$ it reads $c < x < c + \delta$. [L3, L4]

2.1 Suppose $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$. Both $A^{-}$ and $A^{+}$ are subsets of $A$ having $c$ as a limit point, so [L5] gives $\lim_{x \to c} f|_{A^{-}}(x) = L$ and $\lim_{x \to c} f|_{A^{+}}(x) = L$, which by [L6] is exactly $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) = L$ and $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x) = L$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L5, L6]

2.2 Suppose conversely that both one-sided limits equal $L$, and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real. By [L6] and [L1] fix reals $\delta_1, \delta_2 > 0$ such that every $x \in A^{-}$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta_1$ and every $x \in A^{+}$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta_2$ satisfies $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$; let $\delta$ be the smaller of the two. Every $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ lies in $A^{-}$ or in $A^{+}$ by step 1.2, and in either case $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$. As $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary, $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$. [step 1.2, L1, L4, L6, choose]

3.1 The displayed equivalence is steps 2.1 and 2.2. For the consequence: if the limit of $f$ at $c$ exists, say with value $L$, then step 2.1 gives that both one-sided limits exist with the same value $L$, so they agree; and if both one-sided limits exist and are equal, to the common value $L$, then step 2.2 gives that the limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and equals $L$. Each of the three symbols denotes a single real by [L7], so the three are equal. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L7] ∎

## Remarks

- **The two directions are not symmetric in difficulty.** From the two-sided limit to the one-sided ones is pure restriction, [[lem-limit-is-local]]; the converse has to glue two estimates, and the gluing is legitimate precisely because every point of $A$ other than $c$ lies strictly on one side of $c$, which is the totality of the order.

- **The typical failure** is a function whose two one-sided limits exist and differ: the sign function at $0$, on the companion page. Then the two-sided limit cannot exist, since by step 2.1 it would force both one-sided values to equal it.

- **A function may also have no two-sided limit for a different reason**, namely that a one-sided limit fails to exist rather than that the two disagree. The theorem covers that case too, since its right-hand side asserts the existence of both one-sided values, so its failure on one side alone already blocks the two-sided limit. The companion page exhibits both patterns.
