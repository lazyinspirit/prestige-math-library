You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as
an independent adversarial proof-refuter. Return evidence only; Audit-Alpha
alone adjudicates and edits.

## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` proof, actively search for a counterexample. A false
public claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or
materially inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is
nonfatal.

Return no more than 450 words, exactly in this shape:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

For each defect:

```text
FINDING 1
  location: [exact section/fact/step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [exact assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]
```

Always end with:

```text
BOUNDARY: [specific boundary/counterexample checks and disposition]
SOURCES:  [confirm every supplied cited item used by the target was inspected]
CHECKED:  [confirm title, public claim, every numbered step, and Remarks]

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]). If the set

$$D \;=\; \{\, x \in [a,b] : f \text{ is discontinuous at } x \,\}$$

([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-classification-of-discontinuities]]) is at most
countable ([[def-countable]]), then $f$ is Riemann integrable on $[a,b]$
([[def-darboux-integral]]).

**No choice principle is used.** Only the implication "$D$ null $\Rightarrow$ $f$
integrable" of [[thm-lebesgue-criterion]] is invoked, and that implication is a
theorem of ZF; [[lem-countable-sets-are-null]] is choice-free as well, since a
listing of $D$ is a single object and the cover is a formula in the index.

The converse fails badly: the indicator of the Cantor set is discontinuous at
uncountably many points and is integrable, because the Cantor set is null
([[thm-cantor-set-properties]]). What is true in both directions is
[[thm-lebesgue-criterion]] itself.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and a bounded $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ whose set $D$ of discontinuities in $[a,b]$ is at most countable.

[L1] Every at most countable subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has measure zero ([[lem-countable-sets-are-null]], [[def-countable]], [[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

[L2] A bounded $f$ on $[a,b]$ is Riemann integrable if and only if its set of discontinuities has measure zero; the implication from "measure zero" to "integrable" uses no choice principle ([[thm-lebesgue-criterion]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is at most countable by hypothesis, so $D$ has measure zero by [L1]. [given, L1]

2.1 $f$ is bounded on $[a,b]$ and its discontinuity set has measure zero, so [L2] gives that $f$ is Riemann integrable on $[a,b]$. [step 1.1, given, L2] ∎

## Remarks

- **The two classical instances.** A function with finitely many discontinuities is covered ([[thm-finitely-many-discontinuities-integrable]] proves it again by an elementary argument that costs no Lebesgue criterion), and so is a monotone function, whose discontinuity set is at most countable by Froda's theorem ([[thm-froda]]). The direct proof of [[thm-monotone-implies-integrable]] is nevertheless kept, because it is quantitative and elementary.

- **Thomae's function is the standard witness that this corollary has content.** It is discontinuous at every rational and continuous at every irrational ([[thm-dirichlet-and-thomae-continuity-sets]]), so its discontinuity set is countable and it is integrable, while its Dirichlet counterpart, discontinuous everywhere, is not ([[fs-bounded-implies-riemann-integrable]]).

- **Countability is sufficient and not necessary, and it is not even the right invariant.** The Cantor set is uncountable and null, while the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set is uncountable and not null ([[thm-fat-cantor-set-has-positive-measure]]); the first is a discontinuity set of an integrable function and the second is not. Cardinality decides nothing here; measure does.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ denotes the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a subset of it.

The notions **upper bound** and **bounded above** are already fixed by
[[def-complete-ordered-field]] and are only recalled here, never redefined:
$u \in \mathbb{R}$ is an *upper bound* of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$, and
$S$ is *bounded above* if it has at least one upper bound. The dual notions are:

- $\ell \in \mathbb{R}$ is a **lower bound** of $S$ if $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.
- $S$ is **bounded below** if it has at least one lower bound.
- $S$ is **bounded** if it is both bounded above and bounded below, that is, if
  there are $\ell, u \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\ell \le s \le u$ for every $s \in S$.

## Remarks

- A bound is an element of $\mathbb{R}$ and is not required to lie in $S$. A
  bound that does lie in $S$ is a maximum or a minimum ([[def-max-min]]), and
  that is a strictly stronger condition ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Bounds come in half-lines: if $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$ then so is every
  $\ell'' \le \ell$, and if $u$ is an upper bound then so is every $u'' \ge u$.
  Consequently a set that has one bound of a given kind has infinitely many, and
  the interesting question is whether the collection of them has a best element,
  which is what a supremum ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) or an infimum
  ([[def-infimum]]) is.
- Bounded above and bounded below are independent conditions. The set
  $A = \{\, n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} : n \ge 1 \,\}$ of canonical naturals of
  $\mathbb{R}$ is bounded below by $0$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]) and is not
  bounded above ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); its reflection $-A$ is bounded above
  and not bounded below ([[lem-reflection]]).
- The empty set is bounded, and vacuously so: every real number is both an upper
  bound and a lower bound of $\emptyset$, since the defining condition quantifies
  over no elements. Having bounds is therefore much weaker than having a least
  upper bound or a greatest lower bound ([[fs-every-set-has-sup]]).

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Then
$f$ is **discontinuous at $c$**, and $c$ is a **discontinuity of $f$**, when $f$
is not continuous at $c$ ([[def-continuity-real]]). As in
[[def-one-sided-limits]] write

$$A^{-} := A \cap (-\infty, c), \qquad A^{+} := A \cap (c, \infty)$$

([[def-interval]]), and recall that $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x)$ is defined only
when $c$ is a limit point of $A^{-}$, and $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$ only when
$c$ is a limit point of $A^{+}$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]).

**At an isolated point there is nothing to classify.** If $c$ is an isolated
point of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so that $A \cap N_{\rho}(c) = \{c\}$ for
some real $\rho > 0$, then $f$ is continuous at $c$: the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$
condition of [[def-continuity-real]] is satisfied by $\delta := \rho$, since the
only $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \rho$ is $c$ itself and $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0$. So
every discontinuity is a limit point of $A$, and the classification below covers
every case that occurs.

### Two-sided points

Suppose $c$ is a limit point of **both** $A^{-}$ and $A^{+}$, so that both
one-sided limits are well posed. Say that $c$ is a discontinuity

- **of the first kind** when both one-sided limits exist;
- **of the second kind**, also called **essential**, when at least one of the two
  one-sided limits fails to exist.

A discontinuity of the first kind is further

- **removable** when $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) = \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$; the
  common value is then different from $f(c)$, for otherwise
  [[thm-two-sided-limit-iff-both-one-sided]] would give
  $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$ and $f$ would be continuous at $c$
  ([[def-continuity-real]]);
- a **jump** when $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) \ne \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$; the
  difference $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x) - \lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x)$ is then called
  the **jump of $f$ at $c$**.

The three cases *removable*, *jump*, *essential* are mutually exclusive and
exhaust the two-sided discontinuities of $f$: either both one-sided limits
exist, and then they are equal or not, or one of them does not exist.

**Removable is a name for what can be repaired.** If $c$ is a removable
discontinuity with common one-sided value $L$, then the function agreeing with
$f$ off $c$ and taking the value $L$ at $c$ is continuous at $c$, again by
[[thm-two-sided-limit-iff-both-one-sided]] and [[def-continuity-real]]: changing
the single value $f(c)$ removes the discontinuity. No such repair is available at
a jump or at an essential discontinuity, since there the two-sided limit does not
exist at all and no choice of value at $c$ can create it.

### One-sided points

If $c$ is a limit point of exactly one of $A^{-}$ and $A^{+}$, only that side is
defined and only that side is used: $c$ is a discontinuity **of the first kind**
when the one-sided limit on the side in question exists, and **of the second
kind** otherwise. When it exists it is different from $f(c)$, since on such a
point the one-sided condition and the continuity condition are the same
condition; and there is no jump case, there being nothing to compare the value
with. The endpoints of an interval are the typical instance.

**On the two vocabularies.** *First kind* and *second kind* are Rudin's terms and
are recorded because the literature uses them; *removable*, *jump* and
*essential* are the names used in the rest of this library. They name the same
three cases and no third classification is introduced.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field with its order and
absolute value ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]), and
neighbourhoods are those of [[def-neighbourhood-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Then
$f$ is **continuous at $c$** when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

with $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ ranging over the **positive reals**. In the
language of neighbourhoods: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ with

$$f\bigl(A \cap N_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \;\subseteq\; N_{\varepsilon}\bigl(f(c)\bigr).$$

$f$ is **continuous on $A$** when it is continuous at every point of $A$.

**The point $c$ is required to lie in $A$, and the condition is unpunctured.**
Both differ from [[def-function-limit]], and deliberately. There the quantifier
runs over $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, which removes $x = c$; here $x = c$ is allowed,
and at $x = c$ the implication reads $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$, which is
automatic. So allowing $x = c$ costs nothing, and it is what lets the definition
be stated at every point of $A$, including the points where no limit exists.

**Three clauses, and all three are part of the definition.**

1. **At a limit point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is a limit point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]). Then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if the
   limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) \;=\; f(c)$$
   ([[def-function-limit]]). Indeed, for a given $\varepsilon > 0$ a $\delta$
   witnessing continuity witnesses the limit condition, because the limit
   condition quantifies over a subset of the points continuity quantifies over;
   and conversely a $\delta$ witnessing $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$ witnesses
   continuity, because the one point it omits, $x = c$, satisfies
   $|f(c) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ anyway.

2. **At an isolated point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is an isolated point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so that $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ for some real
   $\eta > 0$. Then **every** $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$: take
   $\delta := \eta$, so that the only $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ is $c$
   itself, and $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$.

3. **On a set.** Continuity on $A$ is continuity at each point of $A$, and
   nothing more. It is not a condition relating $f$ to points outside $A$.

Every point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$,
and never both ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so clauses 1 and 2 between them describe
continuity at every point of $A$.

**This is not the raw $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula of
[[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]].** That item records what goes
wrong when the *punctured* formula of [[def-function-limit]] is written down at
an arbitrary point of the domain: at an isolated point it is satisfied
vacuously by every real $L$ at once, so it defines nothing, and this library
therefore leaves $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ **undefined** at an isolated point.
Continuity at an isolated point is a different matter: the formula above is not
vacuous — it is a genuine condition on $f(c)$, satisfied because $f(c)$ is the
only value being compared with itself — and it names a single, well-defined
property. The limit is undefined there; the continuity is defined, and is
automatic. Clause 1 is the only place where the two notions meet, and it is
stated only where the limit exists as a notion.

**Where the distinction disappears.** If $A$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), then every $c \in A$ has some
$N_{\eta}(c) \subseteq A$, and a punctured neighbourhood is never empty
([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), so every point of $A$ is a limit point of $A$ and
clause 1 covers the whole of $A$. The same holds when $A$ is a nondegenerate
interval ([[def-interval]]). Isolated points are what force clause 2 to exist at
all, and they occur as soon as $A$ is allowed to be an arbitrary subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, as in $A = \{0\} \cup [1,2]$.

## Remarks

- **Continuity is local.** If $\eta > 0$ and $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agrees with
  $f$ on $A \cap N_{\eta}(c)$, then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if $g$
  is: any $\delta$ may be replaced by $\min\{\delta, \eta\}$, after which the
  condition only ever evaluates the two functions where they agree. So
  continuity at $c$ sees only an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of $c$, exactly
  as the limit does ([[lem-limit-is-local]]).

- **Continuity passes to subsets of the domain.** If $B \subseteq A$ and
  $c \in B$, then continuity of $f$ at $c$ gives continuity of the restriction
  $f|_B$ at $c$, with the same $\delta$: the condition on $f|_B$ quantifies over
  fewer points. The converse fails, and the standard witness is the indicator of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ restricted to $\mathbb{Q}$, which is constant and hence
  continuous, while the indicator itself is continuous nowhere
  ([[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]]).

- **The radius is a real number.** As in [[def-neighbourhood-r]], $\varepsilon$
  and $\delta$ range over the positive reals here. Restricting either quantifier
  to the positive rationals defines the same relation, by the passage recorded
  in [[def-function-limit]]: below every positive real lies a positive rational
  ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and a real $\delta$ may be shrunk to a rational
  one below it.

- **The word *continuous* is used for two things in this library, and they
  agree.** [[def-metric-continuity]] defines continuity of a map between metric
  spaces, and $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ carries the metric $d(x,y) = |x-y|$. The
  two notions coincide, and that is proved, not assumed:
  [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]] is the dictionary, and it is stated on
  this page precisely so that no later item has to guess.

## Definition

Recall that a natural number is a von Neumann natural
([[def-natural-numbers]]): $0 = \varnothing$ and $\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$, so
that

$$n = \{\, m \in \mathbb{N} : m < n \,\} = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$$

is itself the set of its predecessors. Here $<$ is the order of
[[def-nat-order]], which is defined additively, so the displayed identity is a
theorem and not a convention: it is [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]], proved
immediately above. Let $A$ be a set, and let $\approx$ be equinumerosity
([[def-equinumerous]]).

- $A$ is **finite** if $A \approx n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
- $A$ is **countably infinite** if $A \approx \mathbb{N}$.
- $A$ is **at most countable** if it is finite or countably infinite.
- $A$ is **uncountable** if it is not at most countable.

## Remarks

- **Convention: in this library "countable" alone always means "at most
  countable"**, so a finite set is countable. This is the convention of Halmos
  and of Tao, and it is the one that makes the theorems on this page read
  cleanly: subsets, products and unions of countable sets are countable, with no
  finite/infinite case split in the statement. The competing convention, used by
  Rudin among others, reserves "countable" for "countably infinite" and says
  "at most countable" for the disjunction. Under that convention every statement
  below still holds after replacing "countable" with "at most countable", but
  several would become false as literally written. Where the distinction
  matters, the long forms "countably infinite" and "at most countable" are used
  in full, and "uncountable" always means "not at most countable", on which the
  two conventions agree.

- **The three classes are exhaustive by construction**: every set is finite,
  countably infinite, or uncountable, since "uncountable" is defined as the
  negation of the disjunction. That they are also mutually exclusive, that is,
  that no set is both finite and countably infinite, is a genuine theorem
  amounting to $\mathbb{N} \not\approx n$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and it is
  proved immediately above as claim 4 of [[lem-pigeonhole]]. So a countably
  infinite set is never finite, and "$A$ is infinite", meaning not finite, is
  implied by $A \approx \mathbb{N}$. The same lemma pins down finiteness itself:
  by its claim 3 a finite set is equinumerous with exactly one natural number, so
  the number of elements of a finite set is well defined, and by its claim 5 no
  finite set is equinumerous with a proper subset of itself.

- **What the exclusivity is and is not used for below.** Nothing on this page
  needs it in order to run: the infinitude of $\mathbb{Q}$, for instance, is
  obtained by exhibiting a bijection $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ directly
  ([[thm-rationals-countable]]) rather than by ruling out finiteness. It is used
  where the two notions of infinity are compared
  ([[fs-infinite-has-countable-subset-in-zf]]) and where the continuum hypothesis
  is instantiated at $\mathbb{N}$ ([[rem-continuum-hypothesis]]), both of which
  need $\mathbb{N}$ to be infinite as a fact rather than as a convention.

- **$0$ and the empty set.** $0 = \varnothing$, and $A \approx 0$ holds exactly
  when $A = \varnothing$, so the empty set is finite. This matters in the proofs
  below, where the empty case is always separated out: a surjection
  $\mathbb{N} \to A$ cannot exist when $A = \varnothing$, which is why
  [[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]] assumes $A$ nonempty.

- **Countability is a property of a set alone**, not of a set with structure. In
  particular $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable while carrying a dense order, and
  $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable; neither statement says anything on its own about
  the order or the arithmetic those sets carry.

## Definition

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]). Write $\mathcal{P}$ for the set of all partitions of
$[a,b]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]) and put

$$\mathcal{L} \;:=\; \{\, L(f,P) \ : \ P \in \mathcal{P} \,\}, \qquad \mathcal{U} \;:=\; \{\, U(f,P) \ : \ P \in \mathcal{P} \,\}$$

for the sets of lower and of upper Darboux sums ([[def-darboux-sums]]).

### Both extrema exist

**$\mathcal{P}$ is nonempty**: the pair $(1, t)$ with $t_0 := a$ and $t_k := b$
for $k \ge 1$ is a partition of $[a,b]$, since $a < b$. So $\mathcal{L}$ and
$\mathcal{U}$ are nonempty.

**$\mathcal{L}$ is bounded above and $\mathcal{U}$ is bounded below.** Fix any
$Q \in \mathcal{P}$. By claim 2 of [[lem-refinement-inequalities]],
$L(f,P) \le U(f,Q)$ for every $P \in \mathcal{P}$, so $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound
of $\mathcal{L}$; and $L(f,Q) \le U(f,P)$ for every $P$, so $L(f,Q)$ is a lower
bound of $\mathcal{U}$.

Hence a nonempty set bounded above has a supremum
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and a nonempty set bounded below has an infimum
([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]), each unique ([[lem-sup-unique]]).
The **lower** and **upper Darboux integrals** of $f$ over $[a,b]$ are the real
numbers

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;:=\; \sup \mathcal{L} \;=\; \sup_{P} L(f,P), \qquad \overline{\int_a^b} f \;:=\; \inf \mathcal{U} \;=\; \inf_{P} U(f,P) .$$

### The lower integral never exceeds the upper one

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f .$$

Indeed, for each fixed $Q \in \mathcal{P}$ the number $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound
of $\mathcal{L}$, so the least upper bound satisfies
$\underline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,Q)$. As $Q$ was arbitrary, $\underline{\int_a^b}f$
is a lower bound of $\mathcal{U}$, and the greatest lower bound satisfies
$\underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f$ ([[def-infimum]]).

Moreover, for **every** partition $P$,

$$L(f,P) \;\le\; \underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; U(f,P) ,$$

the outer inequalities because a member of a set is at most its supremum and at
least its infimum.

### Integrability

$f$ is **Darboux integrable on $[a,b]$**, and on this page simply
**integrable**, when

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;=\; \overline{\int_a^b} f ,$$

and then the common value is written

$$\int_a^b f \qquad \text{or} \qquad \int_a^b f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x ,$$

the **integral of $f$ over $[a,b]$**. It is a single well-determined real
number, being the common value of two numbers each of which is unique
([[lem-sup-unique]]). Without the displayed equality the symbol $\int_a^b f$ is
not defined and is never written.

**The inequality above is the whole difficulty.** By the previous paragraph
integrability is *never* a question of one integral exceeding the other, only of
the gap $\overline{\int_a^b} f - \underline{\int_a^b} f \ge 0$ being $0$; and by
[[thm-riemann-criterion]] that gap is $0$ exactly when a single partition can be
found making $U(f,P) - L(f,P)$ small. Whether that is possible is settled
completely, in terms of the discontinuities of $f$, by
[[thm-lebesgue-criterion]].

**"Riemann integrable" means the same thing here.** The definition above is
Darboux's. Riemann's own definition, in terms of tagged partitions of small
mesh, is [[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]], and the two define the same
class of functions with the same integral by [[thm-darboux-equals-riemann]].
Until that theorem is proved the two phrases are kept apart; after it they are
used interchangeably, as they are throughout the literature.

## Remarks

- **The supremum is over all partitions, and nothing is selected.** Both
  $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{U}$ are sets determined by $f$ and $[a,b]$ alone,
  and $\sup$ and $\inf$ are canonical, so no choice principle is involved in
  forming either integral. Where a choice does enter on this page is recorded in
  [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].

- **Why the lower integral is a supremum and not an infimum.** Refining a
  partition can only increase a lower sum and decrease an upper sum
  ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]]), so the lower sums push up towards the
  integral and the upper sums push down towards it. Taking $\inf \mathcal{L}$
  would return the sum over the coarsest partition and would carry no
  information about $f$ beyond its infimum on $[a,b]$.

- **A bounded $f$ always has both integrals; only their equality can fail.** The
  Dirichlet function on $[0,1]$ has lower integral $0$ and upper integral $1$
  ([[fs-bounded-implies-riemann-integrable]]), which is the standard witness that
  the definition above is not vacuous in either direction.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), intervals and their lengths are as in
[[def-interval]], and a *sequence* is a function on $\mathbb{N}$, which contains
$0$. Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

- $A$ has **measure zero**, equivalently $A$ is **null**, when for every real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ there are sequences $(a_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ and
  $(b_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of reals with $a_k \le b_k$ for every $k$, such
  that
  $$A \subseteq \bigcup_{k \in \mathbb{N}} [a_k, b_k] \qquad \text{and} \qquad \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (b_k - a_k) \text{ converges with sum } \le \varepsilon .$$
- $A$ has **content zero** when for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there are
  $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and reals $a_0 \le b_0, \dots, a_n \le b_n$ with
  $$A \subseteq \bigcup_{j \le n} [a_j, b_j] \qquad \text{and} \qquad \sum_{j=0}^{n} (b_j - a_j) \le \varepsilon .$$

The number $b_k - a_k \ge 0$ is the length of $[a_k,b_k]$ ([[def-interval]]), and
the sums are the series and the finite sums of [[def-series]] and
[[def-finite-sum]].

**Working form: only the partial sums have to be checked.** All the terms
$b_k - a_k$ are $\ge 0$, so by claim 2 of
[[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]] the series converges exactly when
its partial sums are bounded above, and its sum is then their supremum.
Consequently, for a fixed $\varepsilon > 0$,

$$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(b_k - a_k) \text{ converges with sum} \le \varepsilon \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \sum_{k<n} (b_k - a_k) \le \varepsilon \ \text{ for every } n \in \mathbb{N},$$

since a supremum is $\le \varepsilon$ exactly when $\varepsilon$ is an upper
bound of the set it is the supremum of ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]). Every
verification of nullity below checks the right-hand condition.

**Closed intervals lose nothing.** A bounded interval with endpoints
$a \le b$ is contained in $[a,b]$ and has the same length ([[def-interval]]), so
a cover by intervals of any of the four bounded forms yields a cover by closed
intervals with the same lengths. The definition is therefore stated with closed
intervals once and for all. Covers by *open* intervals are a genuinely different
demand, and passing to one costs a little extra length: the enlargement
$[a_k,b_k] \subseteq (a_k - \delta_k,\ b_k + \delta_k)$ is carried out where it is
needed, in [[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]] and in
[[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]].

**Both notions are inherited by subsets.** If $B \subseteq A$ and $A$ is null,
then any cover of $A$ covers $B$, so $B$ is null; the same sentence with finite
covers shows a subset of a set of content zero has content zero.

**A finite cover is a countable cover, so content zero implies measure zero.**
Padding the list $[a_0,b_0], \dots, [a_n,b_n]$ with the degenerate intervals
$[0,0]$ for $k > n$ leaves the total length unchanged, by the splitting law for
finite sums ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]). This is recorded as a lemma with its
proof, [[lem-content-zero-implies-null]], because it is cited on its own.

## Remarks

- **The two notions genuinely differ.** $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$ is null and does
  not have content zero ([[cex-null-set-not-of-content-zero]]), so the two
  quantifier patterns, "a sequence of intervals" and "a finite list of
  intervals", are not interchangeable. They do agree for compact sets
  ([[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]]), and the compact case is the only one in
  which content zero is used anywhere on this pair of pages. Nothing is claimed
  about what later pages will do with it.

- **Why "content" and not "measure" for the finite version.** The finite-cover
  notion is the vanishing of the Jordan outer content, and the countable-cover
  notion is the vanishing of the Lebesgue outer measure. Neither outer quantity
  is defined in this library, and no item here assigns a nonzero size to any set:
  every statement is of the shape "can, or cannot, be covered by intervals of
  total length below such and such a bound". That is a deliberate restriction of
  scope at this point in the reading order, not a claim that the general notions
  are unavailable in mathematics.

- **Measure zero is not vacuous and not universal.** No interval with two
  distinct endpoints is null ([[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]]), while
  every at most countable set is ([[lem-countable-sets-are-null]]) and so is the
  uncountable Cantor set ([[thm-cantor-set-properties]]). The three facts
  together are what make the notion worth having.

## Statement

**False claim:** every bounded function $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$
([[def-bounded-set]]) is Riemann integrable on $[a,b]$
([[def-darboux-integral]]).

Boundedness is exactly what is needed for the Darboux sums to **exist**
([[def-darboux-sums]]), and the claim above confuses that with their two extrema
agreeing. The witness below is bounded, takes only the values $0$ and $1$, and
has lower Darboux integral $0$ and upper Darboux integral $1$: as far apart as
the values allow.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The Dirichlet function $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ restricted to $[0,1]$, that is $g : [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ with $g(x) = 1$ for rational $x$ and $g(x) = 0$ for irrational $x$ ([[def-dirichlet-and-thomae-functions]]).

[A1] The false claim: every bounded function on a closed bounded interval with distinct endpoints is Riemann integrable.

[L1] Both $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}$ are dense in $\mathbb{R}$, and a set is dense exactly when every neighbourhood of every real meets it ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L2] For a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[0,1]$: $n \ge 1$, $t_i < t_{i+1}$, $\Delta_i = t_{i+1}-t_i > 0$, $\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = 1 - 0 = 1$, and $I_i = [t_i,t_{i+1}]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-interval]]).

[L3] $m_i = \inf g[I_i]$, $M_i = \sup g[I_i]$, $L(g,P) = \sum_{i<n}m_i\Delta_i$, $U(g,P) = \sum_{i<n}M_i\Delta_i$; $\underline{\int_0^1} g$ is the supremum of the lower sums and $\overline{\int_0^1} g$ the infimum of the upper sums; $g$ is integrable exactly when these agree ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L4] A set with a least element has it as its infimum, and one with a greatest element has it as its supremum; the supremum and infimum of $\{c\}$ are both $c$ ([[def-infimum]], [[def-max-min]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L5] Finite sums: scaling and $\sum_{i<n}0 = 0$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L6] Ordered-field arithmetic: the midpoint $(u+v)\cdot 2^{-1}$ of $u < v$ satisfies $u < (u+v)\cdot 2^{-1} < v$, and $N_\rho(c) \subseteq (u,v)$ for $c$ the midpoint and $\rho := (v-u)\cdot 2^{-1}$ ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $g$ is bounded: $0 \le g(x) \le 1$ for every $x \in [0,1]$, since $g$ takes only the values $0$ and $1$. So its Darboux sums and integrals are defined by [L3]. [given, L3]

1.2 Every subinterval of every partition of $[0,1]$ contains both a rational and an irrational. Let $P = (n,t)$ be a partition and $i < n$; then $t_i < t_{i+1}$ by [L2], so with $c := (t_i + t_{i+1})\cdot 2^{-1}$ and $\rho := (t_{i+1}-t_i)\cdot 2^{-1}$ one has $N_\rho(c) \subseteq (t_i,t_{i+1}) \subseteq I_i$ by [L6], and $N_\rho(c)$ meets $\mathbb{Q}$ and meets $\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}$ by [L1]. [L1, L2, L6]

2.1 Hence $g[I_i] = \{0,1\}$ for every $i < n$, so $m_i = 0$ and $M_i = 1$ by [L4]. [step 1.2, given, L4]

3.1 Therefore $L(g,P) = \sum_{i<n}0\cdot\Delta_i = 0$ and $U(g,P) = \sum_{i<n}1\cdot\Delta_i = \sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = 1$, for **every** partition $P$ of $[0,1]$, by [L3], [L5] and [L2]. [step 2.1, L2, L3, L5]

4.1 The set of lower sums is $\{0\}$ and the set of upper sums is $\{1\}$, so $\underline{\int_0^1} g = 0$ and $\overline{\int_0^1} g = 1$ by [L4] and [L3]. Since $0 \ne 1$, $g$ is not Riemann integrable on $[0,1]$. [step 3.1, L3, L4]

5.1 $g$ is a bounded function on $[0,1]$, an interval with $0 < 1$, and it is not Riemann integrable; so [A1] fails at $g$ and the claim is false. [step 1.1, step 4.1, A1] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the true statement is.** Boundedness is necessary and not sufficient; the exact condition is that the discontinuity set have measure zero ([[thm-lebesgue-criterion]]). The Dirichlet function is discontinuous at **every** point of $[0,1]$ ([[thm-dirichlet-and-thomae-continuity-sets]]), and $[0,1]$ is not null ([[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]]), so the criterion refuses it for the strongest possible reason.

- **The gap is maximal for the values available.** A function with values in $\{0,1\}$ can have upper minus lower integral at most $1$, and this one attains that. Halving the function halves the gap and changes nothing else, so no bound on the size of the failure can be extracted from boundedness alone.

- **The support is not what decides.** Thomae's function is nonzero at exactly the same points as the Dirichlet function, namely the rationals, and differs from it only in the *values* it takes there; yet it **is** integrable, with integral $0$ ([[fs-nonnegative-integrable-with-zero-integral-vanishes]]). What matters is not where a function is nonzero but where it is discontinuous.

## Statement

Every at most countable set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-countable]]) has
measure zero ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

The cover is explicit: the $k$-th point of a listing of $A$ is put inside an
interval of length $\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-k-1}$, and the lengths sum to
$\varepsilon$ by [[thm-geometric-series]]. **No choice principle is used**: a
listing of $A$ is a single object, fixed once ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]]),
and everything after that is a formula in $k$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An at most countable set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a real $\varepsilon > 0$. Throughout, $\theta := 2^{-1}$.

[L1] $A$ is null when for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there are sequences $(a_k)$, $(b_k)$ with $a_k \le b_k$, $A \subseteq \bigcup_k [a_k,b_k]$, and $\sum_{k<n}(b_k - a_k) \le \varepsilon$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

[L2] $[c,d] = \{\, x : c \le x \le d \,\}$ has length $d - c$ when $c \le d$, and $[c,c] = \{c\}$ has length $0$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L3] A nonempty at most countable set admits a surjection $s : \mathbb{N} \to A$ ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]], [[def-countable]]).

[L4] Powers and the geometric series: $\theta^0 = 1$, $\theta^{k+1} = \theta^k\theta$, $\theta^k > 0$, and $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\theta^k = 2$ for $\theta = 2^{-1}$; a series of nonnegative terms has all its partial sums at most its sum ([[def-integer-power]], [[thm-geometric-series]], [[def-series]], [[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]]).

[L5] Finite sums: scaling by a constant, and $\sum_{k<n} 0 = 0$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L6] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 > 0$, $4 > 0$ and $t \cdot 4^{-1} > 0$ for $t > 0$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve an inequality ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let the real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. If $A = \varnothing$, the constant sequences $a_k := 0$ and $b_k := 0$ satisfy $A \subseteq \bigcup_k [0,0]$ vacuously and $\sum_{k<n}(b_k - a_k) = 0 \le \varepsilon$ for every $n$ by [L5], so the condition of [L1] holds at this $\varepsilon$. Assume from now on that $A \ne \varnothing$ and, by [L3], fix a surjection $s : \mathbb{N} \to A$. [given, L1, L2, L3, L5, choose]

2.1 Put $\delta_k := \varepsilon \cdot 4^{-1} \cdot \theta^{k}$, a positive real by [L4] and [L6], and $a_k := s(k) - \delta_k$, $b_k := s(k) + \delta_k$; then $a_k \le b_k$ and $s(k) \in [a_k,b_k]$ by [L6], so $A = \{\, s(k) : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\} \subseteq \bigcup_k [a_k, b_k]$ by step 1.1. The length of $[a_k,b_k]$ is $b_k - a_k = 2\delta_k = \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} \cdot \theta^{k}$ by [L2] and [L6]. [step 1.1, L2, L4, L6]

3.1 For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $\sum_{k<n}(b_k - a_k) = \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} \sum_{k<n}\theta^{k} \le \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} \cdot 2 = \varepsilon$, using scaling from [L5] and the bound on the partial sums of the geometric series from [L4]. [step 2.1, L4, L5, L6]

4.1 So for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the sequences of step 2.1 cover $A$ with all partial total lengths at most $\varepsilon$, which by [L1] is exactly the statement that $A$ has measure zero; the empty case was settled in step 1.1. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 3.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Indexing.** Sequences here start at $k = 0$, and the first interval has
  length $\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$, not $\varepsilon$. The total is
  $\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} \sum_{k \ge 0} 2^{-k} = \varepsilon$ exactly, so the
  cover is as tight as the definition allows and nothing is wasted at the first
  index.

- **Repetitions are harmless.** A surjection $s$ may repeat values, and a finite
  set is covered by infinitely many intervals, most of them redundant. This is
  why the listing form of countability ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]])
  is the convenient one: no injectivity and no case split between the finite and
  the countably infinite case is needed.

- **The converse fails badly.** The Cantor set is uncountable and null

## Statement

Let $C$ be the Cantor set ([[def-cantor-set]]). Then:

1. $C$ is closed and bounded, hence compact
   ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]]);
2. $C$ has content zero, and therefore measure zero
   ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]);
3. $C$ is perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]);
4. $C$ is uncountable ([[def-countable]]);
5. $C$ contains no interval with two distinct endpoints, and is nowhere dense
   ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]]);
6. every nonempty connected subset of $C$ ([[def-connected-r]]) is a single
   point.

Claim 6 is what the phrase "totally disconnected" names elsewhere; that phrase
is **not** used here, because no definition of total disconnectedness exists at
this point in the reading order. What is proved is exactly the displayed
statement, and it is obtained from claim 5 through
[[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The sets $C_n$ and $C$ of [[def-cantor-set]], and the map $\Phi$ and the set $D$ of $\{0,2\}$-valued sequences of [[thm-cantor-set-ternary-description]].

[L1] $C_0 = [0,1]$, $C_{n+1} = \tfrac13 C_n \cup (\tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C_n)$, $C = \bigcap_n C_n \subseteq C_m$ for every $m$, every $C_n \subseteq [0,1]$, $0 \in C$, and $3^{-n} = (3^{-1})^n$ ([[def-cantor-set]], [[def-interval]], [[def-integer-power]], [[lem-power-laws]]).

[L2] $\Phi$ is a bijection from $D$ onto $C$, $\Phi(a) = \sum_{k \ge 0} a_k 3^{-k-1}$, and convergent series add and scale termwise ([[thm-cantor-set-ternary-description]], [[lem-series-linearity]], [[def-series]]).

[L3] $[c,d]$ is a closed set and a bounded interval, $(c,d)$ is open, $N_\varepsilon(x) = (x-\varepsilon, x+\varepsilon)$, and every open set contains a neighbourhood of each of its points ([[def-interval]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L4] Finite unions of closed sets are closed, and an intersection of a nonempty family of closed sets is closed ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]).

[L5] A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is compact exactly when it is closed and bounded ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L6] Content zero and measure zero as in [[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]; a set of content zero is null ([[lem-content-zero-implies-null]]); no null set contains an interval $[u,v]$ with $u < v$ ([[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]]).

[L7] $P$ is perfect when it is closed and no point of it is isolated in it ([[def-perfect-set-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]); every nonempty perfect subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable ([[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]], [[def-countable]]).

[L8] A set is nowhere dense exactly when the interior of its closure is empty, and a closed set equals its closure ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]]).

[L9] A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is connected exactly when it is order-convex ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]], [[def-connected-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L10] $|r|^k \to 0$ for $|r| < 1$ ([[lem-geometric-sequence-null]]); convergence to $0$ is tested against rational $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-real-limit]]); $|z| \ge 0$, $|z| = z$ for $z \ge 0$, and $|uv| = |u||v|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L11] Induction on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]); finite sums split, scale and are monotone in their terms ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L12] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 > 0$, $3 > 0$, $3^{-1} > 0$ and $0 < 2 \cdot 3^{-1} < 1$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve an inequality; the order is total and transitive ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **$C$ is compact, claim 1.** First, for $\lambda \ne 0$ and $c \in \mathbb{R}$ the set $\lambda S + c := \{\lambda s + c : s \in S\}$ is closed whenever $S$ is: if $x \notin \lambda S + c$ then $(x - c)\lambda^{-1} \notin S$, so by [L3] there is a real $\eta > 0$ with $N_\eta((x-c)\lambda^{-1}) \cap S = \varnothing$, and every $z$ with $|z - x| < |\lambda|\eta$ satisfies $|(z-c)\lambda^{-1} - (x-c)\lambda^{-1}| = |z-x| \cdot |\lambda|^{-1} < \eta$ by [L10] and [L12], hence $(z-c)\lambda^{-1} \notin S$ and $z \notin \lambda S + c$. Now every $C_n$ is closed, by induction on $n$ ([L11]): $C_0 = [0,1]$ is closed by [L3], and $C_{n+1}$ is the union of the two closed sets $\tfrac13 C_n$ and $\tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C_n$, hence closed by [L4]. So $C = \bigcap_n C_n$ is closed by [L4], and $C \subseteq [0,1]$ is bounded by [L1] and [L3]; by [L5] it is compact. [L1, L3, L4, L5, L10, L11, L12]

1.2 **$C$ has content zero and measure zero, claim 2.** By induction on $n$ ([L11]) the following holds for every $n$: there are $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and reals $u_0 \le v_0, \dots, u_m \le v_m$ with $C_n \subseteq \bigcup_{j \le m}[u_j,v_j]$ and $\sum_{j \le m}(v_j - u_j) = (2 \cdot 3^{-1})^{n}$. At $n = 0$ take the single interval $[0,1]$, of total length $1 = (2 \cdot 3^{-1})^0$ by [L1]. Given such a list at $n$, define $2m + 2$ intervals by $[u_j 3^{-1},\, v_j 3^{-1}]$ for $j \le m$ and $[2 \cdot 3^{-1} + u_{j-m-1}3^{-1},\, 2 \cdot 3^{-1} + v_{j-m-1}3^{-1}]$ for $m < j \le 2m+1$; they cover $\tfrac13 C_n$ and $\tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C_n$ respectively, hence cover $C_{n+1}$, and their total length is $3^{-1}(2 \cdot 3^{-1})^{n} + 3^{-1}(2 \cdot 3^{-1})^{n} = (2 \cdot 3^{-1})^{n+1}$ by [L11] and [L12]. Since $0 < 2 \cdot 3^{-1} < 1$ by [L12], [L10] gives, for every real $\varepsilon > 0$, an $n$ with $(2 \cdot 3^{-1})^{n} \le \varepsilon$; as $C \subseteq C_n$ by [L1], the corresponding finite list covers $C$ with total length at most $\varepsilon$. So $C$ has content zero by [L6], and hence measure zero by [L6]. [L1, L6, L10, L11, L12]

2.1 **$C$ is perfect, claim 3.** $C$ is closed by step 1.1. Let $x \in C$ and let the real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. By [L2] write $x = \Phi(a)$ with $a \in D$. By [L10] and [L12] fix $k \in \mathbb{N}$ with $2 \cdot 3^{-k-1} < \varepsilon$, and define $b \in D$ by $b_j := a_j$ for $j \ne k$ and $b_k := 2 - a_k$, so $b_k \in \{0,2\}$ and $b \ne a$. Then $\Phi(b) \in C$ and $\Phi(b) \ne \Phi(a)$ by [L2], while $\Phi(b) - \Phi(a) = \sum_{j \ge 0}(b_j - a_j)3^{-j-1} = (b_k - a_k)3^{-k-1}$ by [L2], all other terms being $0$, so $|\Phi(b) - x| = 2 \cdot 3^{-k-1} < \varepsilon$ by [L10]. Thus $N_\varepsilon(x)$ contains a point of $C$ other than $x$, for every $\varepsilon$, so $x$ is not isolated in $C$; by [L7] $C$ is perfect. [step 1.1, L2, L7, L10, L12]

2.2 **$C$ contains no nondegenerate interval and is nowhere dense, claim 5.** By step 1.2 the set $C$ is null, so by [L6] it contains no $[u,v]$ with $u < v$; in particular it contains no interval of any of the four bounded forms with distinct endpoints, since such an interval contains a closed one with distinct endpoints by [L6] and [L12]. Its interior is therefore empty: if $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq C$ for some real $\varepsilon > 0$, then $[x - \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1},\, x + \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}] \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq C$ by [L3] and [L12], an interval with distinct endpoints. Since $C$ is closed by step 1.1, it equals its closure, so [L8] gives that $C$ is nowhere dense. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L3, L6, L8, L12]

3.1 **$C$ is uncountable, claim 4.** $C$ is nonempty, since $0 \in C$ by [L1], and perfect by step 2.1, so [L7] applies. [step 2.1, L1, L7]

3.2 **Connected subsets, claim 6.** Let $E \subseteq C$ be connected and nonempty. By [L9] $E$ is order-convex, so if $u, v \in E$ with $u < v$ then $[u,v] \subseteq E \subseteq C$, contradicting step 2.2. Hence no two distinct elements of $E$ exist, and $E$, being nonempty, is a single point. [step 2.2, L9, L12]

4.1 Claims 1 to 6 are steps 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 3.1, 2.2 and 3.2 respectively, so all six hold. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, step 3.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Two independent proofs of uncountability.** The route above is [[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]] applied to a nonempty perfect set. The other is claim 3 of [[thm-cantor-set-ternary-description]]: $C$ is in bijection with $\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$, which is in bijection with the power set of $\mathbb{N}$, uncountable by [[thm-cantor-powerset]]. The two arguments share nothing, and the second is the one that makes the *size* of $C$ evident: $C$ is in bijection with the power set of $\mathbb{N}$, while having content zero. **It is deliberately not said here that $C$ has as many points as $\mathbb{R}$.** That would require a bijection between $\mathbb{R}$ and the power set of $\mathbb{N}$, and no such bijection is constructed anywhere at this point in the reading order; the two uncountability results available here are separate facts, one proved by the diagonal argument on power sets and one by nested intervals.

- **Claim 2 and claim 4 together are the point of the whole construction.** A set of measure zero may be uncountable, so nullity is not a cardinality condition; and a nowhere dense set need not be null, so it is not a category condition either ([[fs-nowhere-dense-implies-measure-zero]], [[thm-fat-cantor-set-has-positive-measure]]).

- **Why claim 5 is proved through measure and not by inspection.** The intervals making up $C_n$ have length $3^{-n}$, and one can see directly that a long interval cannot fit inside $C$. Doing that rigorously means keeping track of the $2^n$ component intervals of $C_n$ and their gaps; going through [[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]] uses the estimate already made in step 1.2 and needs no such bookkeeping.

- **Every point of $C$ is a limit of other points of $C$, and the witnesses are explicit**: change one ternary digit far out, as step 2.1 does. This is also what shows $C$ has no isolated points without any appeal to the structure of its complement.

## Statement

Let $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ and $t$ be the Dirichlet and Thomae functions
([[def-dirichlet-and-thomae-functions]]), and write $q(x)$ for the least
denominator of a rational $x$, so that $t(x) = 1/\iota(q(x))$ there and
$t(x) = 0$ at every irrational $x$. Then:

1. $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ is continuous at **no** point of $\mathbb{R}$
   ([[def-continuity-real]]);
2. $\omega_{t}(c) = t(c)$ for **every** real $c$ ([[def-oscillation]]);
3. $t$ is continuous at every irrational and discontinuous at every rational, so
   its set of continuity points is exactly $\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$.

**Claim 1 restates, on this page, what
[[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]] already proves.** That item is homed on
the examples page of *Continuity, the intermediate and extreme value theorems,
and uniform continuity*, and an examples page is a leaf of this library: nothing
outside it may depend on an item that lives there. The claim is needed here, and
on later pages, as a citable statement, so it is proved again rather than
quoted. The two statements are the same statement, and neither is stronger than
the other; the proof below is the same argument, and no originality is claimed
for it. This is the pattern
[[ex-distance-to-the-integers-is-1-lipschitz]] follows.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The Dirichlet function $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ and Thomae's function $t$, and a real $c$; $\mathbb{N} \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ are the canonical copies and $\iota(q) = q \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$.

[A1] $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(x) = 1$ for $x \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $0$ otherwise; $t(x) = 1/\iota(q(x)) \in (0,1]$ for $x \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $t(x) = 0$ otherwise, where $q(x) = \min\{q \ge 1 : \iota(q)x \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ ([[def-dirichlet-and-thomae-functions]]).

[L1] Both $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$ are dense in $\mathbb{R}$, so every $N_\delta(y)$ contains a rational and an irrational ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L2] For every real $x$ there is exactly one integer $m$ with $m \le x < m+1$, written $\lfloor x \rfloor$ ([[lem-integer-part]]); consequently no integer lies strictly between two consecutive integers.

[L3] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N) < \eta$; and $\iota$ is positive and strictly increasing on the naturals $\ge 1$, so $1 \le q \le N$ gives $\iota(q) \le \iota(N)$ and $1/\iota(N) \le 1/\iota(q)$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L4] A nonempty finite set of reals presented as $\{a_{0}, \dots, a_{n}\}$ has a minimum ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L5] $\omega_{f}(S) = \sup\{|f(x)-f(y)| : x,y \in S\}$ and $\omega_{f}(c) = \inf\{\omega_{f}(N_\delta(c)) : \delta > 0\}$ for $f$ defined on all of $\mathbb{R}$, both computed in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, where every set has a supremum and an infimum; $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if $\omega_{f}(c) = 0$ ([[def-oscillation]], [[def-extended-reals]], [[lem-extended-reals-complete]], [[thm-continuity-iff-oscillation-zero]]).

[L6] $|u| \ge 0$, $|u - v| \le |u| + |v|$, and if $0 \le u \le M$ and $0 \le v \le M$ then $|u - v| \le M$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Claim 1. Let $c$ be real and let $\delta > 0$ be real. The neighbourhood $N_\delta(c)$ contains a rational $u$ and an irrational $v$, and $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(u) - \mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(v) = 1 - 0 = 1$; since $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(c)$ is $0$ or $1$, one of $|\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(u) - \mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(c)|$ and $|\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(v) - \mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(c)|$ equals $1$. So the continuity condition at $c$ fails for $\varepsilon = 1$, no $\delta$ witnessing it, and $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ is continuous at no point. [A1, L1]

1.2 **A separation estimate.** For a real $c$ and a natural $q \ge 1$ put $m := \lfloor \iota(q)c \rfloor$ and define $d_{q}(c) := 1/\iota(q)$ if $\iota(q)c = m$, and $d_{q}(c) := \min\{\iota(q)c - m,\ m + 1 - \iota(q)c\}/\iota(q)$ otherwise. In both cases $d_{q}(c) > 0$. [L2, L3, construct]

1.3 **A lower bound.** For every real $\delta > 0$ the neighbourhood $N_\delta(c)$ contains an irrational $v$, and $c \in N_\delta(c)$, so $\omega_{t}(N_\delta(c)) \ge |t(c) - t(v)| = t(c)$; taking the infimum over $\delta$ gives $\omega_{t}(c) \ge t(c)$. [A1, L1, L5]

2.1 With $d_{q}(c)$ as in step 1.2: for every integer $p$ with $p/\iota(q) \ne c$ one has $|c - p/\iota(q)| \ge d_{q}(c)$. If $\iota(q)c = m$ then $p \ne m$, so $|\iota(q)c - p| = |m - p| \ge 1$; otherwise $m < \iota(q)c < m+1$, and $p \le m$ gives $\iota(q)c - p \ge \iota(q)c - m$ while $p \ge m+1$ gives $p - \iota(q)c \ge m+1-\iota(q)c$. Dividing by $\iota(q) > 0$ gives the claim. [step 1.2, L2, L3]

2.2 For a real $c$ and a natural $N \ge 1$ put $\delta_{N}(c) := \min\{d_{1}(c), \dots, d_{N}(c)\}$, the minimum of a nonempty finite set of positive reals, so $\delta_{N}(c) > 0$. [step 1.2, L4, construct]

3.1 If $x$ is rational with $0 < |x - c| < \delta_{N}(c)$ then $q(x) > N$ and hence $t(x) < 1/\iota(N)$. Indeed $x = p/\iota(q)$ with $q := q(x)$ and $p := \iota(q)x$; if $q \le N$ then $p/\iota(q) = x \ne c$, so step 2.1 gives $|c - x| \ge d_{q}(c) \ge \delta_{N}(c)$, contrary to the hypothesis. So $q(x) > N$, and $t(x) = 1/\iota(q(x)) < 1/\iota(N)$ because $\iota$ is strictly increasing. [step 2.1, step 2.2, A1, L3]

4.1 **An upper bound for $t$ near $c$.** Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real, take $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N) < \varepsilon$ and put $\delta := \delta_{N}(c)$. Every $x \in N_\delta(c)$ satisfies $0 \le t(x) \le M$ where $M := \max\{t(c), \varepsilon\}$: for $x = c$ this is $t(c) \le M$; for $x \ne c$ rational it is $t(x) < 1/\iota(N) < \varepsilon \le M$ by step 3.1; and for $x$ irrational it is $t(x) = 0$. [step 3.1, A1, L3, L6]

5.1 Hence $\omega_{t}(N_\delta(c)) \le M$ with $\delta$ and $M$ as in step 4.1, since $|t(x) - t(y)| \le M$ for all $x, y \in N_\delta(c)$, so $M$ is an upper bound of the set whose supremum $\omega_{t}(N_\delta(c))$ is; and therefore $\omega_{t}(c) \le M = \max\{t(c), \varepsilon\}$. [step 4.1, L5, L6]

6.1 Claim 2 now follows in the two cases of the value $t(c)$, which are exactly the two cases of the position of $c$. If $c$ is rational then $t(c) > 0$, and applying step 5.1 with the admissible choice $\varepsilon := t(c)$ gives $\omega_{t}(c) \le \max\{t(c), t(c)\} = t(c)$; with step 1.3 this gives $\omega_{t}(c) = t(c)$. [step 5.1, step 1.3, A1, assume-case rat]

6.2 If $c$ is irrational then $t(c) = 0$, and step 5.1 gives $\omega_{t}(c) \le \max\{0, \varepsilon\} = \varepsilon$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$; since also $\omega_{t}(c) \ge 0$, an extended real that is $\le \varepsilon$ for every positive real $\varepsilon$ and $\ge 0$ must be $0$, so $\omega_{t}(c) = 0 = t(c)$. [step 5.1, step 1.3, A1, L5, assume-case irr]

7.1 Every real is rational or irrational and not both, so steps 6.1 and 6.2 establish claim 2 for every real $c$. [step 6.1, step 6.2, cases-exhaustive]

8.1 Claim 3 follows from claim 2: $t$ is continuous at $c$ exactly when $\omega_{t}(c) = 0$, that is exactly when $t(c) = 0$, that is exactly when $c$ is irrational. So the continuity set of $t$ is $\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$ and its discontinuity set is $\mathbb{Q}$. [step 7.1, A1, L5] ∎

## Remarks

- **What claim 2 adds beyond claim 3.** Continuity at a point is the vanishing of the oscillation there, so claim 3 is the special case of claim 2 recording where the value is $0$. The value itself is used on the companion page, where the oscillation of $t$ is computed at particular points, and it shows that the failure of continuity at a rational is exactly as large as the value of $t$ there: small denominators are the bad points.

- **The continuity set of $t$ is $G_\delta$, as it must be.** The irrationals form a $G_\delta$ set ([[cor-q-is-meager-and-not-g-delta]]), in agreement with [[thm-discontinuity-set-is-f-sigma]]. The reverse arrangement is impossible: no function is continuous at every rational and discontinuous at every irrational, because $\mathbb{Q}$ is not $G_\delta$ ([[cor-no-function-is-continuous-exactly-on-q]]).

- **No choice principle is spent.** The separation estimate of step 1.2 is written down from $\lfloor \iota(q)c \rfloor$, the minimum of step 2.1 is the minimum of an explicitly listed finite set, and the least denominator $q(x)$ is a least element. Density supplies points, and it is used only in the form "every neighbourhood meets the set", never to build a sequence.

## Statement

Let $S$ be the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set ([[def-fat-cantor-set]]). Then:

1. $S$ is closed and bounded, hence compact
   ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]]);
2. $S$ is perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]);
3. $S$ is nowhere dense ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]]);
4. if $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ are sequences of reals with $a_k \le b_k$,
   $S \subseteq \bigcup_k [a_k,b_k]$ and $\sum_{k<i}(b_k - a_k) \le M$ for every
   $i \in \mathbb{N}$, then $M \ge 2^{-1}$.

In particular $S$ does **not** have measure zero
([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]): no cover of $S$ by intervals has total
length below $2^{-1}$, let alone below every positive $\varepsilon$.

**Claim 4 is the quantitative form**, and it is what claim 4 of the title asserts
in the only vocabulary available here. This library defines no outer measure, so
"the measure of $S$ is $1/2$" is not a statement it can make; what it can state,
and what is proved below, is that $2^{-1}$ is a lower bound for the total length
of every interval cover of $S$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The lengths $(\lambda_n)$, the gaps $g_n = \lambda_n - \lambda_{n+1}$, the finite lists $(N_n, \ell^{(n)})$ with entries $e^{(n)}_j$, and the sets $S_n$, $S$ of [[def-fat-cantor-set]]. For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $j < N_n$ write $M^{(n)}_j := \big(e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_{n+1},\ e^{(n)}_j + g_n\big)$ for the open interval removed from the $j$-th piece at stage $n$.

[A1] The negation of claim 4: sequences $(a_k)$, $(b_k)$ with $a_k \le b_k$, $S \subseteq \bigcup_k [a_k,b_k]$, all partial sums $\sum_{k<i}(b_k - a_k) \le M$, and $M < 2^{-1}$.

[L1] The construction: $N_0 = 1$, $e^{(0)}_0 = 0$, $\lambda_0 = 1$, $N_{n+1} = N_n + N_n$, $e^{(n+1)}_j = e^{(n)}_j$ for $j < N_n$ and $e^{(n+1)}_{N_n + j} = e^{(n)}_j + g_n$ for $j < N_n$; $S_n = \bigcup_{j<N_n}[e^{(n)}_j, e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n]$; $S = \bigcap_n S_n \subseteq S_m \subseteq [0,1]$; $0 < \lambda_{n+1} < g_n < \lambda_n \le 2^{-n}$; $g_n + \lambda_{n+1} = \lambda_n$; $\lambda_n - 2\lambda_{n+1} = 4^{-n-1}$; and $\sum_{j<N_n} c = 2^{n}c$ for every real $c$ ([[def-fat-cantor-set]], [[def-interval]], [[def-integer-power]], [[lem-power-laws]]).

[L2] $[c,d]$ is a closed set, $(c,d)$ is open, $N_\varepsilon(x) = (x-\varepsilon,x+\varepsilon)$, a closed bounded interval is bounded, finite unions of closed sets are closed and an intersection of a nonempty family of closed sets is closed ([[def-interval]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-bounded-set]], [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]).

[L3] A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is compact exactly when it is closed and bounded ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L4] Perfect means closed with no isolated point; nowhere dense means the interior of the closure is empty, and a closed set equals its closure ([[def-perfect-set-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-nowhere-dense-meager]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]]).

[L5] If $[u,v] \subseteq \bigcup_k [c_k,d_k]$ with $u \le v$, $c_k \le d_k$ and $\sum_{k<i}(d_k - c_k) \le M'$ for every $i$, then $M' \ge v - u$ ([[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]]).

[L6] There is a bijection $J : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-n-cross-n-countable]], [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L7] Finite sums: splitting, scaling, monotonicity in the terms; a finite sum of nonnegative terms indexed injectively inside a finite rectangle is at most the sum over the rectangle ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L8] $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} 2^{-n} = 2$, every partial sum of a nonnegative series is at most its sum, and $2^{-n} \to 0$ ([[thm-geometric-series]], [[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]], [[def-series]], [[lem-geometric-sequence-null]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L9] Induction on $\mathbb{N}$; every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element; every finite list of naturals has an upper bound in $\mathbb{N}$, the order of $\mathbb{N}$ being total ([[thm-induction-principle]], [[thm-well-ordering-principle]], [[lem-nat-trichotomy]], [[def-nat-order]]).

[L10] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 > 0$ and $4 > 0$ and $2^{-1} > 0$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve an inequality; the order is total and transitive ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that claim 4 fails, and fix $(a_k)$, $(b_k)$ and $M$ as in [A1], so that $M < 2^{-1}$. [assume-contra, given, A1, choose]

1.2 **$S$ is compact, claim 1.** Each $S_n$ is the union of the finite list of closed sets $[e^{(n)}_j, e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n]$, $j < N_n$, hence closed by [L2]; so $S = \bigcap_n S_n$ is closed by [L2], and $S \subseteq [0,1]$ is bounded by [L1] and [L2]; by [L3] it is compact. [L1, L2, L3]

1.3 **Separation.** For every $n$ and all $i \ne j$ below $N_n$ one has $|e^{(n)}_i - e^{(n)}_j| > \lambda_n$, by induction on $n$ ([L9]). At $n = 0$ there is nothing to prove, since $N_0 = 1$. Assume it at $n$ and let $i \ne j$ below $N_{n+1} = N_n + N_n$. If both indices are $< N_n$, or both are $\ge N_n$, the two entries are $e^{(n)}_{i'}$ and $e^{(n)}_{j'}$ with $i' \ne j'$, possibly both shifted by the same $g_n$, so the difference has absolute value $> \lambda_n > \lambda_{n+1}$ by [L1]. Otherwise the entries are $e^{(n)}_{i'}$ and $e^{(n)}_{j'} + g_n$; if $i' = j'$ the difference is $g_n > \lambda_{n+1}$ by [L1]; if $e^{(n)}_{i'} - e^{(n)}_{j'} > \lambda_n$ then $e^{(n)}_{i'} - e^{(n)}_{j'} - g_n > \lambda_n - g_n = \lambda_{n+1}$, and if $e^{(n)}_{j'} - e^{(n)}_{i'} > \lambda_n$ then $e^{(n)}_{j'} + g_n - e^{(n)}_{i'} > \lambda_n > \lambda_{n+1}$, in each case by [L1] and [L10]. Consequently the pieces $[e^{(n)}_j, e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n]$, $j < N_n$, are pairwise disjoint. [L1, L9, L10]

1.4 **Every endpoint lies in $S$.** Fix $n$ and $j < N_n$. For $m \le n$ one has $e^{(n)}_j$ and $e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n$ in $S_n \subseteq S_m$ by [L1]. For $m \ge n$, an induction on $m$ ([L9]) gives indices $j', j'' < N_m$ with $e^{(m)}_{j'} = e^{(n)}_j$ and $e^{(m)}_{j''} + \lambda_m = e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n$: at $m = n$ take $j' = j'' = j$; and if they exist at $m$, then $e^{(m+1)}_{j'} = e^{(m)}_{j'}$ works for the left endpoint, while $e^{(m+1)}_{N_m + j''} + \lambda_{m+1} = e^{(m)}_{j''} + g_m + \lambda_{m+1} = e^{(m)}_{j''} + \lambda_m$ works for the right one, by [L1]. So both points lie in every $S_m$, hence in $S$. [L1, L9]

1.5 **The complement decomposes over the stages.** $[0,1] \setminus S = \bigcup_{n}(S_n \setminus S_{n+1})$. The inclusion $\supseteq$ holds because $S_n \subseteq S_0 = [0,1]$ and $S \subseteq S_{n+1}$ by [L1]. For $\subseteq$, let $x \in [0,1] \setminus S$; then $x \in S_0$ and, $S$ being $\bigcap_m S_m$, the set of $m$ with $x \notin S_m$ is nonempty, so by [L9] it has a least element $m_0$, and $m_0 \ge 1$ since $x \in S_0$. Put $n := m_0 - 1$; then $x \in S_n$ by minimality and $x \notin S_{n+1}$. [L1, L9]

2.1 **The removed pieces.** Fix $n$ and $j < N_n$. By [L1] the pieces $[e^{(n)}_j, e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_{n+1}]$ and $[e^{(n)}_j + g_n,\ e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n]$ both occur among the pieces of $S_{n+1}$, so a point $x$ of $[e^{(n)}_j, e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n]$ outside $S_{n+1}$ satisfies $\lambda_{n+1} < x - e^{(n)}_j < g_n$, that is $x \in M^{(n)}_j$; hence $S_n \setminus S_{n+1} \subseteq \bigcup_{j<N_n} M^{(n)}_j$. Conversely $M^{(n)}_j \cap S_{n+1} = \varnothing$: a piece of $S_{n+1}$ coming from $i \ne j$ lies in $[e^{(n)}_i, e^{(n)}_i + \lambda_n]$, which is disjoint from $[e^{(n)}_j, e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n] \supseteq M^{(n)}_j$ by step 1.3, while the two pieces coming from $j$ itself are disjoint from the open interval $M^{(n)}_j$ by [L10]. Finally each $M^{(n)}_j$ has length $g_n - \lambda_{n+1} = \lambda_n - 2\lambda_{n+1} = 4^{-n-1}$, so $\sum_{j<N_n} 4^{-n-1} = 2^{n} \cdot 4^{-n-1} = 4^{-1} \cdot 2^{-n}$ by [L1]. [step 1.3, L1, L10]

2.2 **$S$ is perfect, claim 2.** $S$ is closed by step 1.2. Let $x \in S$ and let the real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given; by [L1] and [L8] fix $n$ with $\lambda_n \le 2^{-n} < \varepsilon$. Since $x \in S_n$ there is $j < N_n$ with $x \in [e^{(n)}_j, e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n]$; the two endpoints of that piece lie in $S$ by step 1.4, are distinct because $\lambda_n > 0$, and each is within $\lambda_n < \varepsilon$ of $x$ by [L10]. So at least one of them is a point of $S \cap N_\varepsilon(x)$ different from $x$, and $x$ is not isolated in $S$; by [L4], $S$ is perfect. [step 1.2, step 1.4, L1, L4, L8, L10]

3.1 **$S$ is nowhere dense, claim 3.** $S$ is closed by step 1.2, so it equals its closure, and by [L4] it suffices that its interior be empty. Suppose $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq S$ for some $x$ and some real $\varepsilon > 0$; fix $n$ with $\lambda_n \le 2^{-n} < \varepsilon$ by [L1] and [L8], and $j < N_n$ with $x \in [e^{(n)}_j, e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n]$. The point $w := e^{(n)}_j + (\lambda_{n+1} + g_n) \cdot 2^{-1}$ lies in $M^{(n)}_j$, since $\lambda_{n+1} < g_n$, and hence in $[e^{(n)}_j, e^{(n)}_j + \lambda_n]$, so $|w - x| \le \lambda_n < \varepsilon$ and $w \in N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq S \subseteq S_{n+1}$; but $M^{(n)}_j \cap S_{n+1} = \varnothing$ by step 2.1, which is impossible. So no neighbourhood is contained in $S$ and $S$ is nowhere dense. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L1, L4, L8, L10]

3.2 **A cover of $[0,1]$ built from [A1] and the removed pieces.** By [L6] fix a bijection $J$ and define sequences $(c_i)$, $(d_i)$ as follows: for $i \in \mathbb{N}$ write $(m, t) := J^{-1}(i)$; if $m = 0$ put $(c_i, d_i) := (a_t, b_t)$; if $m \ge 1$ and $t < N_{m-1}$ put $(c_i,d_i) := \big(e^{(m-1)}_t + \lambda_{m}, \ e^{(m-1)}_t + g_{m-1}\big)$; and otherwise put $(c_i,d_i) := (0,0)$. Then $c_i \le d_i$ for every $i$ by [L1], and $\bigcup_i [c_i,d_i]$ contains $S$ by [A1] and contains $[0,1] \setminus S$ by steps 1.5 and 2.1, hence contains $[0,1]$. For a partial sum, fix $i_0$; the pairs $J^{-1}(i)$ with $i < i_0$ are distinct, so by [L9] there is $P$ bounding both of their coordinates, and since all the terms are nonnegative [L7] gives $\sum_{i<i_0}(d_i - c_i) \le \sum_{t \le P}(b_t - a_t) + \sum_{n \le P}\sum_{t < N_n} 4^{-n-1} \le M + \sum_{n\le P} 4^{-1}2^{-n} \le M + 4^{-1} \cdot 2 = M + 2^{-1}$, using [A1], step 2.1, [L7] and [L8]. [step 1.1, step 1.5, step 2.1, A1, L1, L6, L7, L8, L9]

4.1 By [L5] applied to $[0,1]$ and the cover of step 3.2, $M + 2^{-1} \ge 1 - 0 = 1$, so $M \ge 2^{-1}$, contradicting step 1.1. Claim 4 therefore holds; and $S$ is not null, since nullity would give, at $\varepsilon := 4^{-1}$, a cover of $S$ with all partial total lengths $\le 4^{-1} < 2^{-1}$, which claim 4 forbids. With steps 1.2, 2.2 and 3.1 all four claims are proved. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.2, step 3.1, step 3.2, L5, L10, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Nowhere dense and null are independent.** $S$ is nowhere dense and not null;
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is null and not nowhere dense ([[lem-countable-sets-are-null]],
  [[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]). The two false statements recording this are
  [[fs-nowhere-dense-implies-measure-zero]] and
  [[fs-measure-zero-implies-nowhere-dense]], with witnesses
  [[cex-nowhere-dense-with-positive-measure]] and
  [[cex-dense-set-of-measure-zero]].

- **Where the construction differs from the Cantor set, and where it does not.**
  Steps 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.2 and 3.1 use only that the pieces shrink to $0$ in
  length, double in number and stay separated, which the middle-thirds
  construction also satisfies; so $S$ and $C$ are indistinguishable at that level.
  The difference is entirely in step 2.1: the removed length at stage $n$ is
  $4^{-1}2^{-n}$ here and $2^{n}3^{-n-1}$ there, and only the first is summable to
  less than $1$. The removed lengths are added up in
  [[ex-fat-cantor-measure-computed]], where they total exactly $2^{-1}$.

- **Compactness is not what is used against nullity.** The proof of claim 4 never
  extracts a finite subcover: it combines the given countable cover of $S$ with
  the countably many removed pieces and appeals to
  [[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]], whose own proof is where the
  compactness of $[0,1]$ is spent. Passing through
  [[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]] would work too and would be longer.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]). Suppose there are $r \in \mathbb{N}$ and points
$d_0, \dots, d_{r-1} \in [a,b]$ such that $f$ is continuous
([[def-continuity-real]]) at every point of $[a,b]$ other than
$d_0, \dots, d_{r-1}$; that is, every discontinuity of $f$
([[def-classification-of-discontinuities]]) occurs among those $r$ listed
points. Then $f$ is Riemann integrable on $[a,b]$ ([[def-darboux-integral]]).

For $r = 0$ the hypothesis says $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and the conclusion
is [[thm-continuous-implies-integrable]]; the argument below covers that case
without a separate treatment. Repetitions in the list are allowed and harmless,
and no claim is made that the listed points **are** discontinuities: the
hypothesis is one-sided, so a finite superset of the discontinuity set is enough.

**Nothing is said about the kind of the discontinuities.** They may be
removable, jumps, or essential ([[def-classification-of-discontinuities]]); only
their number matters. Boundedness is a genuine hypothesis, since an unbounded
function has no Darboux sums at all ([[def-darboux-sums]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$; a bounded $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$; a real $M_{+} > 0$ with $|f(x)| \le M_{+}$ for every $x \in [a,b]$; and $r \in \mathbb{N}$ with points $d_0, \dots, d_{r-1} \in [a,b]$ such that $f$ is continuous at every $x \in [a,b]$ with $x \ne d_k$ for all $k < r$.

[L1] For a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[a,b]$: $n \ge 1$, $\Delta_i = t_{i+1}-t_i > 0$, $\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = b-a$, $\Delta_i \le \|P\|$, no $t_j$ with $j \le n$ lies strictly between $t_i$ and $t_{i+1}$, inserting a point does not increase the mesh and adds that point to $\operatorname{pts}(P)$, and the uniform partition $U_N$ has mesh $(b-a)/\iota(N)$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L2] $U(f,P) - L(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}(M_i-m_i)\Delta_i$, $M_i - m_i = \sup\{|f(x)-f(y)| : x,y \in I_i\}$, and $0 \le M_i - m_i \le 2M_{+}$ ([[def-darboux-sums]]).

[L3] Riemann's criterion: a bounded $f$ is integrable if and only if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a partition $P$ with $U(f,P)-L(f,P) < \varepsilon$ ([[thm-riemann-criterion]]).

[L4] A closed bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is compact, and a continuous real function on a compact subset $K$ of $\mathbb{R}$ is uniformly continuous on $K$: for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ with $|g(x)-g(y)| < \eta$ for all $x,y \in K$ with $|x-y| < \delta$. This holds for $K = \varnothing$ as well, the condition being vacuous there ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]], [[thm-heine-cantor-r]], [[def-uniform-continuity-real]]).

[L5] Every open interval is an open set, an arbitrary union of open sets is open, a complement of an open set is closed, an intersection of closed sets is closed, and $[a,b]$ is closed and bounded ([[def-interval]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L6] For $u < v$ the endpoints $u$ and $v$ are adherent to $(u,v)$, so every closed set containing $(u,v)$ contains $[u,v]$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L7] If $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c \in A$ and $c \in B \subseteq A$, then the restriction $g|_B$ is continuous at $c$ as a function on $B$: the same $\delta$ works, the condition quantifying over fewer points ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L8] Finite sums: splitting, additivity, scaling, monotonicity in the terms, and telescoping ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]). Also the interchange of two finite sums, $\sum_{i<n}\sum_{k<r}c_{i,k} = \sum_{k<r}\sum_{i<n}c_{i,k}$ for any doubly indexed family of reals. That identity is **not** one of the six clauses of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] and is therefore proved here, by induction on $r$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]). At $r = 0$ each inner sum $\sum_{k<0}c_{i,k}$ is $0$ by the recursion clause of [[def-finite-sum]], so the left side is $\sum_{i<n}0 = 0$ by clause 2 of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] taken with $\lambda = 0$, while the right side is an empty sum and so is $0$ as well. Passing from $r$ to $r+1$, the recursion clause and clause 1 of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] give $\sum_{i<n}\sum_{k<r+1}c_{i,k} = \sum_{i<n}\bigl(\sum_{k<r}c_{i,k} + c_{i,r}\bigr) = \sum_{i<n}\sum_{k<r}c_{i,k} + \sum_{i<n}c_{i,r}$, which by the induction hypothesis is $\sum_{k<r}\sum_{i<n}c_{i,k} + \sum_{i<n}c_{i,r} = \sum_{k<r+1}\sum_{i<n}c_{i,k}$, again by the recursion clause. Note that $n$ is fixed throughout the induction and only $r$ varies.

[L9] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L10] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N) < \eta$; $\iota(N) > 0$ for $N \ge 1$ and $\iota(r) \ge 0$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L11] Ordered-field arithmetic and the absolute value: adding a constant and multiplying by a positive quantity preserve an inequality; the order is total and transitive; $x,y \in [c,d]$ gives $|x-y| \le d-c$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-interval]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. Put $\theta := \varepsilon \cdot \bigl(4(b-a)\bigr)^{-1}$ and $\eta := \varepsilon \cdot \bigl(16\,M_{+}(\iota(r)+1)\bigr)^{-1}$, both positive reals by [L10] and [L11]. [given, L10, L11]

2.1 Put $V := \bigcup_{k<r}\,(d_k - \eta,\ d_k + \eta)$, an open set by [L5], and $K := [a,b] \setminus V = [a,b] \cap (\mathbb{R}\setminus V)$, an intersection of two closed sets, hence closed by [L5], and bounded since $K \subseteq [a,b]$; so $K$ is compact by [L4]. [step 1.1, L4, L5, construct]

3.1 $f$ is continuous at every point of $K$: a point $x \in K$ is not any $d_k$, since $d_k \in (d_k-\eta, d_k+\eta) \subseteq V$ and $K$ misses $V$. Hence the restriction $f|_K$ is continuous on $K$ by [L7]. [step 2.1, given, L7, L11]

4.1 By [L4] applied to $f|_K$ on the compact set $K$ with the value $\theta$, fix a real $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(x)-f(y)| < \theta$ for all $x,y \in K$ with $|x-y| < \delta$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L4, choose]

5.1 By [L10] fix a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N) < \delta \cdot (b-a)^{-1}$, so that the uniform partition $U_N$ has mesh $(b-a)/\iota(N) < \delta$ by [L1] and [L11]. Let $P = (n,t)$ be the partition obtained from $U_N$ by inserting, one after another, those of the $2r$ points $d_k - \eta$ and $d_k + \eta$ with $k < r$ that lie in $[a,b]$. By [L1] each insertion leaves the mesh no larger, so $\|P\| < \delta$, and $\operatorname{pts}(P)$ contains every one of those points that lies in $[a,b]$. [step 4.1, L1, L10, L11, choose, construct]

6.1 **A dichotomy for each subinterval and each $k$.** Fix $i < n$ and $k < r$, and write $c^{-} := d_k - \eta$ and $c^{+} := d_k + \eta$. Neither $c^{-}$ nor $c^{+}$ lies in the open interval $(t_i,t_{i+1})$: if such a point lies in $[a,b]$ it is a member of $\operatorname{pts}(P)$ by step 5.1, hence is some $t_j$ with $j \le n$, and no $t_j$ lies strictly between $t_i$ and $t_{i+1}$ by [L1]; and if it lies outside $[a,b]$ it is outside $[t_i,t_{i+1}]$ altogether. [step 5.1, L1, L11]

7.1 Consequently either $(t_i,t_{i+1}) \cap (c^{-},c^{+}) = \varnothing$, or $I_i \subseteq [c^{-},c^{+}]$. Suppose the intersection contains a point $z$ and let $w \in (t_i,t_{i+1})$. If $w \le c^{-}$ then $c^{-}$ lies between $w$ and $z$, both in the order-convex set $(t_i,t_{i+1})$, so $c^{-} \in (t_i,t_{i+1})$, contradicting step 6.1; likewise $w \ge c^{+}$ is impossible. So $(t_i,t_{i+1}) \subseteq (c^{-},c^{+})$. Then $c^{-} < z < t_{i+1}$ with $c^{-} \notin (t_i,t_{i+1})$ forces $c^{-} \le t_i$, and symmetrically $c^{+} \ge t_{i+1}$, that is $I_i \subseteq [c^{-},c^{+}]$. [step 6.1, L11, given]

8.1 Call $i < n$ **bad** when $I_i \subseteq [d_k-\eta, d_k+\eta]$ for some $k < r$, and **good** otherwise. If $i$ is good then by step 7.1 the open interval $(t_i,t_{i+1})$ meets no $(d_k-\eta,d_k+\eta)$, hence $(t_i,t_{i+1}) \subseteq K$; since $K$ is closed, [L6] gives $I_i = [t_i,t_{i+1}] \subseteq K$. [step 2.1, step 7.1, L6]

9.1 For a good $i$: all $x,y \in I_i$ lie in $K$ and satisfy $|x-y| \le \Delta_i \le \|P\| < \delta$ by [L1] and [L11], so $|f(x)-f(y)| < \theta$ by step 4.1; therefore $\theta$ bounds the set whose supremum is $M_i - m_i$, and $M_i - m_i \le \theta$ by [L2]. [step 4.1, step 5.1, step 8.1, L1, L2, L11]

9.2 **Bounding the bad lengths.** For $k < r$ put $J_k := \{\, i < n : d_k - \eta \le t_i \text{ and } t_{i+1} \le d_k + \eta \,\}$, so that $i$ is bad exactly when $i \in J_k$ for some $k < r$, and put $h^{k}_i := \Delta_i$ for $i \in J_k$ and $h^{k}_i := 0$ otherwise. Each $J_k$ is a set of consecutive indices: if $i < i' < i''$ with $i, i'' \in J_k$ then $d_k - \eta \le t_i \le t_{i'}$ and $t_{i'+1} \le t_{i''+1} \le d_k + \eta$, so $i' \in J_k$. [step 8.1, L1, L11, construct]

10.1 $\sum_{i<n} h^{k}_i \le 2\eta$ for each $k < r$. If $J_k = \varnothing$ the sum is $0$. Otherwise let $p := \min J_k$ and let $q$ be the least natural with $q > p$ and $q \notin J_k$, which exists by [L9] because $n \notin J_k$; by step 9.2 then $J_k = \{\, i : p \le i < q \,\}$, since an $i \in J_k$ with $i \ge q$ together with $p \in J_k$ and $p < q \le i$ would put $q \in J_k$. Splitting the sum at $p$ and at $q$ and discarding the vanishing outer parts ([L8]) gives $\sum_{i<n}h^{k}_i = \sum_{i=p}^{q-1}\Delta_i = t_q - t_p$ by telescoping, and $p \in J_k$, $q-1 \in J_k$ give $t_p \ge d_k-\eta$ and $t_q \le d_k+\eta$, whence $t_q - t_p \le 2\eta$. [step 9.2, L8, L9, L11]

11.1 Put $\beta_i := \Delta_i$ for $i$ bad and $\beta_i := 0$ for $i$ good. Then $\beta_i \le \sum_{k<r}h^{k}_i$ for every $i < n$, all terms being nonnegative and a bad $i$ lying in some $J_k$; so by [L8], $\sum_{i<n}\beta_i \le \sum_{i<n}\sum_{k<r}h^{k}_i = \sum_{k<r}\sum_{i<n}h^{k}_i \le \sum_{k<r}2\eta = 2\eta\,\iota(r)$, using step 10.1. [step 9.2, step 10.1, L8, L11]

12.1 For every $i < n$ one has $(M_i - m_i)\Delta_i \le \theta\,\Delta_i + 2M_{+}\,\beta_i$: for good $i$ this is step 9.1 together with $\beta_i \ge 0$, and for bad $i$ it follows from $M_i - m_i \le 2M_{+}$ in [L2] and $\beta_i = \Delta_i$, together with $\theta\Delta_i \ge 0$. [step 9.1, step 11.1, L2, L11]

13.1 Summing step 12.1 over $i < n$ and using [L8], [L1] and step 11.1: $U(f,P) - L(f,P) \le \theta\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i + 2M_{+}\sum_{i<n}\beta_i \le \theta(b-a) + 4M_{+}\eta\,\iota(r) \le \varepsilon\cdot 4^{-1} + \varepsilon\cdot 4^{-1} < \varepsilon$, the last estimate because $4M_{+}\eta\,\iota(r) \le 4M_{+}\eta(\iota(r)+1) = \varepsilon\cdot 4^{-1}$ by step 1.1. [step 1.1, step 11.1, step 12.1, L1, L2, L8, L10, L11]

14.1 The real $\varepsilon > 0$ of step 1.1 was arbitrary and step 13.1 produced a partition $P$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$, so [L3] applies and $f$ is Riemann integrable on $[a,b]$. [step 1.1, step 13.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the two budgets go.** The $\varepsilon/4$ of step 13.1 that is spent on the good subintervals buys uniform continuity away from the bad points; the $\varepsilon/4$ spent on the bad ones buys nothing but their total length, and it is affordable only because there are finitely many of them and $\eta$ may be chosen after $r$ is known. Both halves survive verbatim when "finitely many points" is replaced by "a set of measure zero", and that replacement is [[thm-lebesgue-criterion]].

- **The listing form of the hypothesis is deliberate.** Saying "the set of discontinuities is finite" would require a notion of finiteness and a listing theorem to use it; saying "every discontinuity is among $d_0,\dots,d_{r-1}$" is what the proof consumes and is what every application supplies. The same device is used by [[lem-finite-set-has-max]].

- **The result is genuinely weaker than what is true.** Thomae's function has infinitely many discontinuities and is integrable, and so is the indicator of the Cantor set, whose discontinuity set is uncountable. What survives is that a *finite* discontinuity set never obstructs integrability, whatever the function does at those points.

- **Choice.** The proof selects nothing from an infinite family; the only countable choice behind it is the single use inside [[thm-heine-cantor-r]], invoked at step 4.1. See [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].

## Statement

Let $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be order-convex ([[def-interval]]) and let
$f : I \to \mathbb{R}$ be monotone ([[def-monotone-function]]). Then the set

$$D \;:=\; \{\, c \in I : f \text{ is discontinuous at } c \,\}$$

([[def-classification-of-discontinuities]]) is **at most countable**
([[def-countable]]).

More precisely, the proof exhibits an injection $J : D \to \mathbb{N}$
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]) built from one fixed enumeration of the
rationals: at a discontinuity $c$ interior to $I$ the value $J(c)$ is read off
the **least index** of a rational lying in the gap
$\bigl(\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x),\ \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)\bigr)$, which is a
nonempty open interval by [[thm-monotone-discontinuities-are-jumps]]. The map
$J$ is therefore determined by $f$ and by the fixed enumeration, and **no choice
principle is used**: least indices are canonical by
[[thm-well-ordering-principle]], and nothing anywhere in the proof is selected
without being determined.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An order-convex $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a monotone $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$; and $\mathbb{Q}$ denotes the canonical copy of the rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$.

[A1] $I$ is order-convex: $x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$ imply $z \in I$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L1] A nondecreasing $f$ on an order-convex $I$ has, at every $c \in I$, each well-posed one-sided limit; and if both $I^{-} = I \cap (-\infty,c)$ and $I^{+} = I \cap (c,\infty)$ are nonempty then $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) = \sup\{f(x) : x \in I, x < c\}$ and $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x) = \inf\{f(x) : x \in I, x > c\}$ ([[thm-monotone-one-sided-limits-exist]]).

[L2] For a nondecreasing $f$ on an order-convex $I$ and a point $c$ with both $I^{-}$ and $I^{+}$ nonempty, $f$ is discontinuous at $c$ if and only if $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) < \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$ ([[thm-monotone-discontinuities-are-jumps]]).

[L3] $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-rationals-countable]]) and the map $q \mapsto \hat q$ embeds $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ injectively ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), so composing a bijection $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$ with that embedding gives a bijection $e : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ onto the canonical copy of the rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$; and strictly between any two distinct reals there lies a point of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]], [[def-equinumerous]], [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L4] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L5] Every subset of $\mathbb{N}$ is at most countable, and a set in bijection with an at most countable set is at most countable ([[lem-subset-of-countable]], [[def-countable]], [[def-equinumerous]], [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L6] $f$ is discontinuous at $c$ exactly when it is not continuous there, and $|(-f)(x) - (-f)(c)| = |f(x) - f(c)|$, so $f$ and $-f$ have exactly the same points of discontinuity ([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-monotone-function]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 It is enough to treat a nondecreasing $f$: if $f$ is nonincreasing then $-f$ is nondecreasing and has the same discontinuity set, so the conclusion for $-f$ is the conclusion for $f$. Assume from here on that $f$ is nondecreasing. [L6]

1.2 Fix once and for all a bijection $e : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$; everything below is defined in terms of $f$, $I$ and this one function. [L3, choose]

1.3 Call $c \in I$ **interior** when both $I^{-}$ and $I^{+}$ are nonempty, and write $D_{0}$ for the set of interior points of $I$ at which $f$ is discontinuous. A point of $I$ that is not interior has $I^{-} = \varnothing$, and is then a least element of $I$, or $I^{+} = \varnothing$, and is then a greatest element of $I$; a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has at most one least and at most one greatest element, so $D \setminus D_{0}$ has at most two elements. [A1]

2.1 For $c \in D_{0}$ put $L^{-}(c) := \lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x)$ and $L^{+}(c) := \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$, both of which exist, and note $L^{-}(c) < L^{+}(c)$. [step 1.3, L1, L2]

2.2 Let $c, c' \in D_{0}$ with $c < c'$. Take $t := e(k)$ for the least $k$ with $c < e(k) < c'$, which exists because a point of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ lies strictly between $c$ and $c'$; then $t \in I$, since $c, c' \in I$ and $I$ is order-convex. [step 1.3, A1, L3, L4]

3.1 For $c \in D_{0}$ the set $K(c) := \{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : L^{-}(c) < e(k) < L^{+}(c) \,\}$ is nonempty, since a point of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ lies strictly between the two distinct reals $L^{-}(c)$ and $L^{+}(c)$ and $e$ is onto $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$; so $j(c) := \min K(c)$ is a well-defined natural number, determined by $c$, $f$ and $e$ alone. [step 2.1, L3, L4]

3.2 With $c < t < c'$ as in step 2.2: $L^{+}(c) = \inf\{f(x) : x \in I, x > c\} \le f(t)$ because $t$ is one of the points in that set, and $f(t) \le \sup\{f(x) : x \in I, x < c'\} = L^{-}(c')$ for the same reason on the other side. Hence $L^{+}(c) \le L^{-}(c')$. [step 2.2, L1]

4.1 The two open intervals $(L^{-}(c), L^{+}(c))$ and $(L^{-}(c'), L^{+}(c'))$ are therefore disjoint, so no point of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ lies in both, so $e(j(c)) \ne e(j(c'))$ and hence $j(c) \ne j(c')$. Since $c < c'$ was an arbitrary pair of distinct elements of $D_{0}$, the map $j : D_{0} \to \mathbb{N}$ is injective. [step 3.1, step 3.2]

5.1 Define $J : D \to \mathbb{N}$ by $J(c) := 2\,j(c) + 1$ for $c \in D_{0}$; $J(c) := 0$ if $c \in D \setminus D_{0}$ is a least element of $I$; and $J(c) := 2$ if $c \in D \setminus D_{0}$ is a greatest element of $I$ and not a least one. Then $J$ is injective: it is injective on $D_{0}$ by step 4.1, it separates the at most two points of $D \setminus D_{0}$ from each other, and its values on $D_{0}$ are odd while its values off $D_{0}$ are even. [step 1.3, step 4.1, construct]

6.1 Consequently $J$ is a bijection from $D$ onto the subset $J[D] \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, which is at most countable; countability transfers along that bijection, so $D$ is at most countable. [step 5.1, L5] ∎

## Remarks

- **The bound is attained.** Froda's theorem gives no better bound than *at most countable*, and none is available: for every at most countable $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ there is a bounded nondecreasing function on $\mathbb{R}$ whose discontinuity set is exactly $E$ ([[thm-monotone-with-prescribed-discontinuity-set]]). Taking $E = \mathbb{Q}$ gives a nondecreasing function discontinuous at every rational and continuous at every irrational.

- **What the choice-freedom rests on.** Two canonical selections, and nothing else: one fixed bijection $e : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$, produced by [[thm-rationals-countable]], whose own proof spends no choice principle; and the least element of a nonempty set of naturals ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]). Replacing "least index" by "some index" would turn step 3.1 into an application of a choice principle over the possibly uncountable index set $D_{0}$.

- **Monotonicity is doing all the work, not continuity of anything.** The only property of $f$ used after step 1.1 is the inequality $L^{+}(c) \le L^{-}(c')$ of step 3.2, which says that the gaps opened by distinct discontinuities are laid out in the same order as the discontinuities themselves and therefore do not overlap. A function that is not monotone can be discontinuous everywhere ([[thm-dirichlet-and-thomae-continuity-sets]]).

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]) and let

$$D \;:=\; \{\, x \in [a,b] \ : \ f \text{ is discontinuous at } x \,\}$$

([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-classification-of-discontinuities]]). Then

$$f \text{ is Riemann integrable on } [a,b] \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad D \text{ has measure zero}$$

([[def-darboux-integral]], [[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

**The choice cost, named.** The implication from integrability to $D$ being null
uses the Axiom of Countable Choice ([[def-countable-choice]]) exactly once,
through [[thm-countable-union-of-null-is-null]] at step 7.1: $D$ is exhibited as
the union of a sequence of null sets. The converse implication, from $D$ null to
integrability, is a theorem of ZF: it uses no choice principle at all.

**"Measure zero" here is the cover condition of
[[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]**, namely that for every $\varepsilon > 0$
there is a sequence of intervals covering $D$ of total length at most
$\varepsilon$. No outer measure, no measurable set and no Lebesgue integral is
used or needed; the criterion is a statement about interval covers throughout.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, a bounded $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $M_{+} > 0$ with $|f(x)| \le M_{+}$ for every $x \in [a,b]$, and $D$ as in the Statement.

[A1] The Axiom of Countable Choice, used only where [L11] is invoked ([[def-countable-choice]]).

[L1] For a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[a,b]$: $n \ge 1$, $\Delta_i = t_{i+1}-t_i > 0$, $\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = b-a$, $I_i = [t_i,t_{i+1}] \subseteq [a,b]$, and appending a point $y > t_n$ to a partition of $[a,t_n]$ gives a partition of $[a,y]$ whose subintervals are the old ones together with $[t_n,y]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L2] $U(f,P) - L(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}(M_i-m_i)\Delta_i$, $M_i - m_i = \omega_f(I_i)$, and $0 \le M_i - m_i \le 2M_{+}$ ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-oscillation]]).

[L3] Riemann's criterion: a bounded $f$ is integrable if and only if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a partition $P$ with $U(f,P)-L(f,P) < \varepsilon$ ([[thm-riemann-criterion]]).

[L4] Oscillation: $\omega_f(S) \le \omega_f(T)$ for $S \subseteq T \subseteq [a,b]$; $0 \le \omega_f(x) \le \omega_f([a,b] \cap N_\rho(x))$ for every real $\rho > 0$ and every $x \in [a,b]$; $\omega_f(x)$ is the infimum of those values over $\rho > 0$; and since $f$ is bounded every one of these values is a real number in $[0, 2M_{+}]$ ([[def-oscillation]], [[def-extended-reals]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L5] $f$ is continuous at $x \in [a,b]$ if and only if $\omega_f(x) = 0$; hence $D = \{x \in [a,b] : \omega_f(x) > 0\}$ ([[thm-continuity-iff-oscillation-zero]], [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L6] For every real $\sigma > 0$ there is a closed $G \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ with $\{x \in [a,b] : \omega_f(x) \ge \sigma\} = [a,b] \cap G$ ([[lem-oscillation-superlevel-sets-are-closed]]).

[L7] A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is compact exactly when it is closed and bounded; $[a,b]$ is closed and bounded; an intersection of closed sets is closed; every open interval is an open set ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], [[def-interval]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L8] $A$ has content zero when for every real $\tau > 0$ there are $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and reals $c_0 \le e_0, \dots, c_m \le e_m$ with $A \subseteq \bigcup_{j \le m}[c_j,e_j]$ and $\sum_{j \le m}(e_j - c_j) \le \tau$; $A$ has measure zero when the same holds with a sequence of intervals and every partial total length at most $\tau$; a subset of a null set is null ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

[L9] A set of content zero has measure zero ([[lem-content-zero-implies-null]]), and for a **compact** set the two notions coincide ([[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]]).

[L10] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $k \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(k) < \eta$; $\iota(k) > 0$ for $k \ge 1$, $\iota$ is nonnegative and nondecreasing on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L11] Assuming [A1], the union of a sequence of null subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ is null ([[thm-countable-union-of-null-is-null]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L12] Finite sums: splitting, additivity, scaling, monotonicity in the terms, and telescoping ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]). Also the interchange of two finite sums, $\sum_{i<n}\sum_{j<p}c_{i,j} = \sum_{j<p}\sum_{i<n}c_{i,j}$ for any doubly indexed family of reals; below it is applied with $p := m+1$, since $\sum_{j \le m}$ abbreviates $\sum_{j<m+1}$. That identity is **not** one of the six clauses of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] and is therefore proved here, by induction on $p$ with $n$ held fixed ([[thm-induction-principle]]). At $p = 0$ each inner sum $\sum_{j<0}c_{i,j}$ is $0$ by the recursion clause of [[def-finite-sum]], so the left side is $\sum_{i<n}0 = 0$ by clause 2 of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] taken with $\lambda = 0$, while the right side is an empty sum and so is $0$ as well. Passing from $p$ to $p+1$, the recursion clause and clause 1 of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] give $\sum_{i<n}\sum_{j<p+1}c_{i,j} = \sum_{i<n}\bigl(\sum_{j<p}c_{i,j} + c_{i,p}\bigr) = \sum_{i<n}\sum_{j<p}c_{i,j} + \sum_{i<n}c_{i,p}$, which by the induction hypothesis is $\sum_{j<p}\sum_{i<n}c_{i,j} + \sum_{i<n}c_{i,p} = \sum_{j<p+1}\sum_{i<n}c_{i,j}$, again by the recursion clause.

[L13] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]); every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ bounded above has a supremum ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L14] Ordered-field arithmetic and the absolute value: adding a constant and multiplying by a positive quantity preserve an inequality; the order is total and transitive; an open interval is order-convex ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-interval]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For a real $\sigma > 0$ put $E_\sigma := \{\, x \in [a,b] : \omega_f(x) \ge \sigma \,\}$. By [L5], $E_\sigma \subseteq D$ for every $\sigma > 0$. [L4, L5, construct]

2.1 **Each $E_\sigma$ has content zero, assuming $f$ integrable.** Let $\sigma > 0$ and $\tau > 0$ be real. By [L3] fix a partition $P = (n,t)$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \sigma\tau \cdot 2^{-1}$. Let $B := \{\, i < n : (t_i,t_{i+1}) \cap E_\sigma \ne \varnothing \,\}$ and put $\chi_i := 1$ for $i \in B$ and $\chi_i := 0$ otherwise. [step 1.1, L3, L14, choose, construct]

2.2 **The exhaustion of $D$.** Put $\sigma_k := 1/\iota(k+1)$ for $k \in \mathbb{N}$, a positive real by [L10]. Then $D = \bigcup_{k \in \mathbb{N}} E_{\sigma_k}$. For the inclusion from left to right, let $x \in D$, so $\omega_f(x) > 0$ by [L5] and $\omega_f(x)$ is a real by [L4]; if $\omega_f(x) \ge 1 = \sigma_0$ then $x \in E_{\sigma_0}$, and otherwise [L10] gives a natural $k+1 \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(k+1) < \omega_f(x)$, so $x \in E_{\sigma_k}$. For the reverse inclusion, $x \in E_{\sigma_k}$ gives $\omega_f(x) \ge \sigma_k > 0$, hence $x \in D$ by [L5]. [step 1.1, L4, L5, L10, L14]

2.3 **The converse; this half of the proof is steps 2.3, 3.2, 4.2, 5.2, 6.2, 7.2, 8.1, 9.1, 10.1, 11.1, 12.1 and 13.1, and its symbols are its own.** Assume $D$ null and let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. Put $\sigma' := \varepsilon \cdot \bigl(2(b-a)\bigr)^{-1}$ and $\tau' := \varepsilon \cdot \bigl(8M_{+}\bigr)^{-1}$, both positive by [L14]. By step 1.1 and [L8], $E_{\sigma'} \subseteq D$ is null. [step 1.1, given, L8, L14]

3.1 For $i \in B$ one has $M_i - m_i \ge \sigma$: fix $x \in (t_i,t_{i+1}) \cap E_\sigma$; since $(t_i,t_{i+1})$ is open there is a real $\rho > 0$ with $N_\rho(x) \subseteq (t_i,t_{i+1})$, so $[a,b] \cap N_\rho(x) \subseteq I_i$ and [L4] gives $\sigma \le \omega_f(x) \le \omega_f([a,b] \cap N_\rho(x)) \le \omega_f(I_i) = M_i - m_i$ by [L2]. [step 2.1, L1, L2, L4, L7, choose]

3.2 $E_{\sigma'}$ is compact: by [L6] there is a closed $G$ with $E_{\sigma'} = [a,b] \cap G$, an intersection of two closed sets, hence closed; and $E_{\sigma'} \subseteq [a,b]$ is bounded. So [L7] applies. [step 2.3, L6, L7]

4.1 Hence $\sigma\chi_i\Delta_i \le (M_i - m_i)\Delta_i$ for every $i < n$, the case $i \notin B$ because both $M_i - m_i \ge 0$ and $\Delta_i > 0$. Summing and using [L12] and [L2]: $\sigma \sum_{i<n}\chi_i\Delta_i \le U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \sigma\tau \cdot 2^{-1}$, so $\lambda := \sum_{i<n}\chi_i\Delta_i < \tau \cdot 2^{-1}$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L2, L12, L14]

4.2 By [L9] applied to the compact null set $E_{\sigma'}$, it has content zero, so by [L8] there are $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and reals $c_0 \le e_0, \dots, c_m \le e_m$ with $E_{\sigma'} \subseteq \bigcup_{j \le m}[c_j,e_j]$ and $\sum_{j\le m}(e_j-c_j) \le \tau' \cdot 2^{-1}$. Put $\mu := \tau' \cdot \bigl(4(\iota(m)+1)\bigr)^{-1} > 0$ and $O_j := (c_j - \mu,\ e_j + \mu)$, an open interval containing $[c_j,e_j]$, of length $(e_j - c_j) + 2\mu$. Then $\sum_{j\le m}\bigl((e_j-c_j)+2\mu\bigr) \le \tau' \cdot 2^{-1} + 2\mu(\iota(m)+1) = \tau' \cdot 2^{-1} + \tau' \cdot 2^{-1} = \tau'$, by [L12] and [L10]. [step 2.3, step 3.2, L8, L9, L10, L12, L14, construct]

5.1 $E_\sigma$ is covered by the finite list of $2n+1$ closed intervals $[p_j,q_j]$, $j \le 2n$, defined by $[p_j,q_j] := [t_j,t_{j+1}]$ for $j < n$ with $j \in B$, $[p_j,q_j] := [a,a]$ for $j < n$ with $j \notin B$, and $[p_j,q_j] := [t_{j-n},t_{j-n}]$ for $n \le j \le 2n$: indeed a point of $E_\sigma$ lies in $[a,b]$, hence is one of $t_0,\dots,t_n$ or lies in some $(t_i,t_{i+1})$, and in the latter case $i \in B$. Its total length is $\sum_{j \le 2n}(q_j - p_j) = \sum_{i<n}\chi_i\Delta_i + 0 = \lambda < \tau$, by splitting the sum at $n$ ([L12]). [step 2.1, step 4.1, L1, L12, L14, construct]

5.2 **The family of good intervals.** Let $\mathcal{W}$ be the set of all open intervals $(u,v)$ with $u < v$ such that either $(u,v) \subseteq O_j$ for some $j \le m$, or $\omega_f([a,b]\cap(u,v)) < \sigma'$. Every $x \in [a,b]$ lies in a member: if $x \in E_{\sigma'}$ then $x \in [c_j,e_j] \subseteq O_j$ for some $j \le m$ by step 4.2, and $O_j$ is itself a member; and if $x \notin E_{\sigma'}$ then $\omega_f(x) < \sigma'$, so by [L4] some real $\rho > 0$ has $\omega_f([a,b]\cap N_\rho(x)) < \sigma'$, and $N_\rho(x) = (x-\rho,x+\rho)$ is a member containing $x$. [step 4.2, L4, L7, L14, construct]

6.1 As $\tau > 0$ was arbitrary, $E_\sigma$ has content zero by [L8], hence measure zero by [L9]; this used only that $f$ is integrable. [step 2.1, step 5.1, L8, L9]

6.2 **Cousin's construction: a partition each of whose subintervals lies in a member of $\mathcal{W}$.** Let $S$ be the set of $y \in (a,b]$ such that some partition of $[a,y]$ has every subinterval contained in a member of $\mathcal{W}$. $S$ is nonempty: by step 5.2 fix $(\alpha,\beta) \in \mathcal{W}$ with $a \in (\alpha,\beta)$ and put $y_0 := \min\{(a+b)\cdot 2^{-1},\ (a+\beta)\cdot 2^{-1}\}$, so $a < y_0 \le b$, $y_0 < \beta$ and $\alpha < a$; the one-subinterval partition of $[a,y_0]$ has $[a,y_0] \subseteq (\alpha,\beta)$, so $y_0 \in S$. Also $S$ is bounded above by $b$, so $s := \sup S$ exists by [L13] and $a < y_0 \le s \le b$. [step 5.2, L1, L13, L14, choose]

7.1 **Integrability implies $D$ null.** Assume $f$ integrable. By step 6.1 each $E_{\sigma_k}$ is null, and $k \mapsto E_{\sigma_k}$ is a sequence of subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, so [L11] applies and $\bigcup_k E_{\sigma_k} = D$ is null by step 2.2. This is the only use of [A1] in the proof. [step 6.1, step 2.2, A1, L11]

7.2 $s = b$. By step 5.2 fix $(\alpha',\beta') \in \mathcal{W}$ with $s \in (\alpha',\beta')$. Since $\sup S = s > \alpha'$ there is $x \in S$ with $x > \alpha'$, and $x \le s$. Suppose $s < b$ and choose a real $y$ with $s < y < \min\{b, \beta'\}$, possible because $s < b$ and $s < \beta'$. Then $\alpha' < x \le s < y < \beta'$, so $[x,y] \subseteq (\alpha',\beta')$, and appending $y$ to a partition of $[a,x]$ witnessing $x \in S$ gives one for $[a,y]$ by [L1]; hence $y \in S$ with $y > \sup S$, which is impossible. [step 6.2, L1, L13, L14, choose]

8.1 $b \in S$. By step 5.2 fix $(\alpha'',\beta'') \in \mathcal{W}$ with $b \in (\alpha'',\beta'')$. Since $\sup S = b > \alpha''$ there is $x \in S$ with $x > \alpha''$ and $x \le b$. If $x = b$ there is nothing to prove; otherwise $\alpha'' < x < b < \beta''$ gives $[x,b] \subseteq (\alpha'',\beta'')$, and appending $b$ as in step 7.2 puts $b$ in $S$. So there is a partition $P' = (n',t')$ of $[a,b]$, with subintervals $I'_i$ and lengths $\Delta'_i$ for $i < n'$, every subinterval of which lies in a member of $\mathcal{W}$. [step 5.2, step 7.2, L1, L13, L14, choose]

9.1 **Good and bad subintervals.** Write $M'_i := \sup f[I'_i]$ and $m'_i := \inf f[I'_i]$. Call $i < n'$ **good** when $I'_i \subseteq W$ for some $W = (u,v) \in \mathcal{W}$ with $\omega_f([a,b]\cap(u,v)) < \sigma'$, and **bad** otherwise. For a good $i$, $I'_i \subseteq [a,b] \cap W$, so $M'_i - m'_i = \omega_f(I'_i) \le \omega_f([a,b]\cap W) < \sigma'$ by [L2] and [L4]. For a bad $i$, step 8.1 supplies a member containing $I'_i$, and it is not of the second kind, so $I'_i \subseteq O_j$ for some $j \le m$. [step 8.1, L1, L2, L4]

10.1 **Bounding the bad lengths.** For $j \le m$ put $J_j := \{\, i < n' : c_j - \mu \le t'_i \text{ and } t'_{i+1} \le e_j + \mu \,\}$ and $h^{j}_i := \Delta'_i$ for $i \in J_j$, $h^{j}_i := 0$ otherwise; a bad $i$ lies in some $J_j$ by step 9.1. Each $J_j$ consists of consecutive indices, since $i < i^{\dagger} < i^{\ddagger}$ with $i,i^{\ddagger} \in J_j$ gives $c_j - \mu \le t'_i \le t'_{i^{\dagger}}$ and $t'_{i^{\dagger}+1} \le t'_{i^{\ddagger}+1} \le e_j + \mu$. [step 9.1, L1, L14, construct]

11.1 $\sum_{i<n'}h^{j}_i \le (e_j - c_j) + 2\mu$ for each $j \le m$: the sum is $0$ when $J_j = \varnothing$; otherwise let $p := \min J_j$ and let $q$ be the least natural with $q > p$ and $q \notin J_j$, which exists by [L13] since $n' \notin J_j$, so that $J_j = \{\, i : p \le i < q \,\}$ by step 10.1. Splitting the sum at $p$ and at $q$ and discarding the vanishing outer parts, then telescoping ([L12]), gives $\sum_{i<n'}h^{j}_i = \sum_{i=p}^{q-1}\Delta'_i = t'_q - t'_p \le (e_j+\mu) - (c_j-\mu)$, using $p \in J_j$ and $q-1 \in J_j$. [step 10.1, L12, L13, L14]

12.1 Put $\beta_i := \Delta'_i$ for bad $i$ and $\beta_i := 0$ for good $i$. Then $\beta_i \le \sum_{j \le m}h^{j}_i$ pointwise by step 10.1, all terms being nonnegative, so by [L12] and step 11.1, $\sum_{i<n'}\beta_i \le \sum_{j\le m}\sum_{i<n'}h^{j}_i \le \sum_{j\le m}\bigl((e_j-c_j)+2\mu\bigr) \le \tau'$, the last step by step 4.2. [step 4.2, step 10.1, step 11.1, L12, L14]

13.1 For every $i < n'$, $(M'_i-m'_i)\Delta'_i \le \sigma'\Delta'_i + 2M_{+}\beta_i$: for good $i$ by step 9.1 and $\beta_i \ge 0$, for bad $i$ by $M'_i - m'_i \le 2M_{+}$ from [L2] and $\beta_i = \Delta'_i$. Summing over $i < n'$ and using [L12], [L1] and step 12.1: $U(f,P')-L(f,P') \le \sigma'(b-a) + 2M_{+}\tau' = \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1} + \varepsilon \cdot 4^{-1} < \varepsilon$. [step 2.3, step 9.1, step 12.1, L1, L2, L12, L14]

14.1 The real $\varepsilon > 0$ of step 2.3 was arbitrary and step 13.1 produced a partition with $U - L < \varepsilon$, so $f$ is integrable by [L3]. With step 7.1 this proves both implications, and the criterion is established; the forward half is steps 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1, 6.1 and 7.1, working with $\sigma, \tau, P, B, \chi, \lambda$, and the converse half is the steps named in step 2.3, working with $\sigma', \tau', P', \mathcal{W}, S$. [step 7.1, step 2.3, step 13.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the two halves cost.** The forward half is a single application of Riemann's criterion for each threshold $\sigma$, plus the countable union; the backward half is where all the work is, and it is entirely a covering argument: the bad set is compact and null, hence of content zero, hence coverable by finitely many open intervals of small total length, and the rest of $[a,b]$ is chopped up by Cousin's construction into pieces of oscillation below $\sigma$.

- **Why Cousin's construction and not a Lebesgue number.** Step 6.2 to step 8.1 build the partition directly from the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$: the set of right endpoints reachable by a good partition is nonempty and bounded, and its supremum is shown to be $b$ and to be attained. This uses no sequence, no subsequence and no choice, whereas the usual Lebesgue-number argument selects a bad interval for each $n$ and then extracts a convergent subsequence, which costs countable choice. Since the whole point of this item's choice ledger is that the backward implication is a ZF theorem, the choice-free route is the one taken.

- **The superlevel sets, not the discontinuity set, are what is covered.** $D$ itself is in general not closed, so [[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]] does not apply to it; each $E_\sigma$ **is** closed in $[a,b]$ ([[lem-oscillation-superlevel-sets-are-closed]]) and bounded, and that is exactly the hypothesis needed. The passage back from the $E_{\sigma_k}$ to $D$ is step 2.2, and it is where the countable union appears.

- **The exhaustion $D = \bigcup_k E_{1/\iota(k+1)}$ is derived here, and it is also claim 1 of [[thm-discontinuity-set-is-f-sigma]].** When this proof was written that theorem stated only the descriptive form — $D$ as the trace on the domain of an $F_\sigma$ subset of $\mathbb{R}$ — which is not the pointwise identity step 2.2 needs, so the identity was derived inline from [[thm-continuity-iff-oscillation-zero]] and the Archimedean property. The exhaustion has since been stated there as claim 1, precisely because several items were quoting it from a theorem that did not assert it. The inline derivation is retained because it is three lines and keeps this item's choice ledger readable in one place; citing claim 1 instead would be equally correct.

- **Both directions are sharp in the obvious sense.** The indicator of the Cantor set is discontinuous on an uncountable null set and is integrable; the indicator of the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set is discontinuous on a nowhere dense set that is not null and is not integrable ([[fs-integrability-is-equivalent-to-a-nowhere-dense-discontinuity-set]]). So neither cardinality nor category decides integrability; only measure does.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be monotone, that is
nondecreasing or nonincreasing on $[a,b]$ ([[def-monotone-function]]). Then $f$
is bounded ([[def-bounded-set]]) and Riemann integrable on $[a,b]$
([[def-darboux-integral]]).

Moreover, for the uniform partition $U_N$ of $[a,b]$ into $N \ge 1$ parts
([[def-partition-and-refinement]]),

$$U(f,U_N) - L(f,U_N) \;=\; \bigl|f(b) - f(a)\bigr| \cdot \frac{b-a}{\iota(N)} ,$$

where $\iota(N)$ is the canonical natural of $N$ in $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-canonical-natural]]). The right-hand side is an **equality**, not an
estimate: the sum $\sum_{i<N}(M_i - m_i)$ telescopes exactly, because on each
subinterval a monotone function attains its extremes at the two endpoints.

No continuity is assumed, and none holds in general: a nondecreasing function may
be discontinuous at every rational
([[thm-monotone-with-prescribed-discontinuity-set]]), and the companion page of
this pair works out the integral of the floor function, the simplest
discontinuous monotone integrand.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and a monotone $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$. Let $N \ge 1$ be a natural number and let $U_N = (N,t)$ be the uniform partition of $[a,b]$ into $N$ parts, with subintervals $I_i = [t_i,t_{i+1}]$ and lengths $\Delta_i = (b-a)/\iota(N)$ for $i < N$.

[L1] $f$ is nondecreasing, meaning $f(x) \le f(y)$ whenever $x \le y$ in $[a,b]$, or nonincreasing, meaning $f(x) \ge f(y)$ whenever $x \le y$; these two cases are what "monotone" means and they exhaust it ([[def-monotone-function]]).

[L2] For the uniform partition: $t_0 = a$, $t_N = b$, $t_i < t_{i+1}$, every $\Delta_i = (b-a)/\iota(N) > 0$, and $\sum_{i<N}\Delta_i = b-a$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L3] If a nonempty set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ has a greatest element then that element is $\sup S$, and if it has a least element then that element is $\inf S$ ([[def-max-min]], [[def-infimum]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L4] $M_i = \sup f[I_i]$, $m_i = \inf f[I_i]$, $U(f,P) - L(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}(M_i-m_i)\Delta_i$ ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L5] Finite sums: scaling and telescoping, $\sum_{i<N}(c_{i+1}-c_i) = c_N - c_0$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L6] Riemann's criterion: a bounded $f$ is integrable if and only if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a partition $P$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$ ([[thm-riemann-criterion]]).

[L7] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N) < \eta$, and $\iota(N) > 0$ for $N \ge 1$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L8] Ordered-field arithmetic and the absolute value: adding a constant and multiplying by a positive quantity preserve an inequality; the order is total and transitive; $|x| = x$ for $x \ge 0$ and $|x| = -x$ for $x \le 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-interval]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 By [L1] there are two cases, $f$ nondecreasing and $f$ nonincreasing, and they exhaust the hypothesis. Every $x \in [a,b]$ satisfies $a \le x \le b$ ([[def-interval]]). [given, L1, cases]

1.2 **Case: $f$ is nondecreasing.** Then $f(a) \le f(x) \le f(b)$ for every $x \in [a,b]$, so $f$ is bounded by [L8]; and for $i < N$ and $x \in I_i$ one has $t_i \le x \le t_{i+1}$, hence $f(t_i) \le f(x) \le f(t_{i+1})$. Since $f(t_i)$ and $f(t_{i+1})$ themselves lie in $f[I_i]$, they are its least and greatest elements, so $m_i = f(t_i)$ and $M_i = f(t_{i+1})$ by [L3]. [assume-case up, given, L2, L3, L8]

1.3 **Case: $f$ is nonincreasing.** Then $f(b) \le f(x) \le f(a)$ for every $x \in [a,b]$, so $f$ is bounded; and for $i < N$ and $x \in I_i$ one has $f(t_{i+1}) \le f(x) \le f(t_i)$, so $m_i = f(t_{i+1})$ and $M_i = f(t_i)$ by [L3]. [assume-case down, given, L2, L3, L8]

2.1 In the nondecreasing case, $M_i - m_i = f(t_{i+1}) - f(t_i)$, so by [L4], [L2] and [L5], $U(f,U_N) - L(f,U_N) = \sum_{i<N}\bigl(f(t_{i+1}) - f(t_i)\bigr)\frac{b-a}{\iota(N)} = \frac{b-a}{\iota(N)}\bigl(f(t_N) - f(t_0)\bigr) = \frac{b-a}{\iota(N)}\bigl(f(b) - f(a)\bigr)$, and $f(b) - f(a) \ge 0$, so this equals $|f(b)-f(a)|(b-a)/\iota(N)$ by [L8]. [step 1.2, L2, L4, L5, L8]

2.2 In the nonincreasing case the same computation gives $U(f,U_N) - L(f,U_N) = \frac{b-a}{\iota(N)}\bigl(f(a) - f(b)\bigr)$ with $f(a) - f(b) \ge 0$, which is again $|f(b)-f(a)|(b-a)/\iota(N)$ by [L8]. The two cases of step 1.1 exhaust the hypothesis, so the displayed identity holds for every monotone $f$, which is also bounded. [step 1.3, L2, L4, L5, L8, cases-exhaustive]

3.1 Let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given and put $\eta := \varepsilon \cdot \bigl((|f(b)-f(a)| + 1)(b-a)\bigr)^{-1}$, a positive real by [L8]. By [L7] fix a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N) < \eta$. [step 2.2, L7, L8, choose]

4.1 Then $U(f,U_N) - L(f,U_N) = |f(b)-f(a)|\,(b-a)/\iota(N) \le (|f(b)-f(a)|+1)(b-a)/\iota(N) < (|f(b)-f(a)|+1)(b-a)\,\eta = \varepsilon$: the first inequality because $(b-a)/\iota(N) > 0$ and $|f(b)-f(a)| \le |f(b)-f(a)|+1$, and the second because $(|f(b)-f(a)|+1)(b-a) > 0$ and $1/\iota(N) < \eta$. So $U(f,U_N) - L(f,U_N) < \varepsilon$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, L8]

5.1 Since the real $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary and step 4.1 produced a partition with $U - L < \varepsilon$, criterion [L6] applies: $f$ is bounded by steps 1.2 and 1.3 and Riemann integrable on $[a,b]$. [step 1.2, step 1.3, step 4.1, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- **The telescoping is exact, and that is what makes the proof short.** No estimate of $M_i - m_i$ is needed subinterval by subinterval: the whole sum of the gaps is the total rise of $f$, however wildly the rise is distributed. This is why a monotone function with infinitely many jumps is no harder than a continuous one here, and it is the same telescoping that [[def-partition-and-refinement]] uses for the lengths.

- **Uniformity of the partition is a convenience, not a necessity.** For an arbitrary partition $P$ the same identification of $m_i$ and $M_i$ gives $U(f,P) - L(f,P) \le \|P\| \cdot |f(b)-f(a)|$, by bounding each $\Delta_i$ by the mesh before telescoping. The uniform partition is used above only so that $\Delta_i$ can be pulled out of the sum as a constant.

- **No choice principle is used.** The partition is given by a formula in $N$, and $N$ is obtained from one instance of the Archimedean property. See [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].

- **Monotone is strictly weaker than continuous here.** The floor function is nondecreasing with jumps at every integer and is integrable (the companion page of this pair); and a monotone function has at most countably many discontinuities ([[thm-froda]]), so this theorem is also a special case of [[cor-countably-many-discontinuities-integrable]] once that is available. The direct proof is kept because it is elementary and quantitative, and because it costs no choice at all.
