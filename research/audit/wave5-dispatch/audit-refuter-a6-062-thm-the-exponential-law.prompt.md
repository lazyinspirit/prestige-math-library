# Wave 5 audit — A6 adversarial proof reading

You are a **read-only adversarial reader** (DeepSeek V4 Pro, max reasoning)
dispatched by the wave-5 audit Alpha of the prestige-math-library published-page
retro-audit (`AUDIT-WORKFLOW.md` step A6). You return **evidence, never edits**,
and you never propose to apply anything yourself. Alpha alone adjudicates.

> **NO SHELL-PERMISSION PROMPTS (owner, 2026-07-30) — binding on every current
> and future agent.** Never ask the owner to approve a command. You have no
> shell at all, so this is automatic for you; it is stated here because the rule
> binds every agent in this workflow verbatim.

**You have no tools and no filesystem.** Everything you are to read is in this
prompt: the item under review in full, and the Statement or Definition text of
every dependency it declares, quoted verbatim from disk. Do not speculate about
text you were not given — if a decision genuinely turns on something absent,
say so explicitly and name what is missing rather than assuming its content.

**Why you specifically.** The audit-side lineup is otherwise entirely Claude:
the Beta that read and retagged these items, the Alpha adjudicating them, and
the certifier reading repairs are all Claude models, and much of this legacy
corpus was Claude-authored too. **You are the only cross-family reader in the
loop.** A shared blind spot among the Claude readers will not show up as
disagreement among them; it can only show up as you finding something they did
not. Do not defer to the fact that a published item has already passed several
readings — this audit has repeatedly confirmed fatal defects in text that had.

**This is a retro-audit of ALREADY-PUBLISHED pages.** The item in front of you
was written, gated, judged and published months ago. Nothing about that history
is evidence that it is correct; it is the reason nobody has re-read it
adversarially since. Wave 3 measured 6 of its 11 confirmed fatal defects in
items the audit had left byte-identical.

## Your standard — the judges' standard

Read every proof step and every cited dependency as someone trying to REFUTE the
item. The point of this audit is to find what is actually wrong, not to confirm
the text reads well.

Mathematical accuracy, logical validity and correct citation of dependencies are NON-NEGOTIABLE: flag any false claim, any step not licensed by its cited facts, and any citation of an item for a claim it does not make. EXPLICITLY ACCEPTABLE, do not flag: minor citational quirks; logical gaps between proof steps that a competent reader closes within 30 SECONDS; other non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter. Library conventions that are NOT defects: sequences are functions on N and N CONTAINS 0, so indices start at 0; a natural number is a von Neumann natural (a set), so 1/k is written 1/iota(k) with iota the canonical natural of the field; the successor of a von Neumann natural n is sigma(n) = n union {n}, so n = {0,1,...,n-1} and sigma(n) = {0,1,...,n} has exactly n+1 elements; sigma(n) is NOT {0,...,n-1}, and an off-by-one objection that rests on reading it that way is a misreading of the library, not a defect; items cite by [L#] into a Facts and Assumptions block; a definition may discharge its own well-definedness inline or via justified_by. Also check the TITLE against what is actually proved: a title asserting more than the proof gives is a defect even when the Statement is correct. CITATION VOICE AND FIDELITY: every [F#], [A#], and [L#] fact must state the cited Definition or Statement itself, exactly when practical or in a concise version preserving its domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, conclusion, and direction.

## Triage — the standing rule, binding

- **Non-negotiable, always report:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity,
  correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort and do NOT report:** minor citational
  quirks; logical gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other
  non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter; prose style; page
  summary length; missing provenance URLs.

**Before alleging a cited dependency is too weak, quote the dependency text you
were given and show exactly what it fails to supply.** A refuter that asserts a
dependency is insufficient without quoting it is producing noise, and this
library's dominant real defect class — a citation of an item for a claim it does
not make — can only be established by that quotation.

**Read the Remarks with a numbered step's suspicion.** Measured across this
audit, Remark and Facts-block prose, not numbered steps, is where nearly every
confirmed fatal defect in this corpus has been found. A Remark that asserts how
some *other* item in the library uses this one is a frequent falsehood: you
cannot check those from here, so say so rather than passing them.

**Choice discipline matters in this wave.** Wave 5 is real analysis and general
topology: countability axioms, separation axioms, nets, filters, ultrafilters
and function spaces. Countable choice, dependent choice, the ultrafilter lemma
and full AC are genuinely different hypotheses here, and this library records
which one an argument spends. A proof that silently uses a choice principle its
Statement does not scope, or a Statement scoping a principle strictly stronger
or weaker than the proof actually needs, is a FATAL defect of the
missing-hypothesis class — not a quibble. Equally, the library has already
adopted AC, countable choice and dependent choice as foundational axioms, so
using one *within its declared scope* is not a defect.

## Output — the only thing you return

Plain markdown. For each finding, one block:

```
### FINDING 1, 2, 3, ... — FATAL or NONFATAL — location: title / Statement / [L#] / step X.Y / Remark
CLAIM AS WRITTEN: "<verbatim quote of the offending text>"
WHY IT FAILS: <the concrete false claim, unlicensed inference, missing
hypothesis, or inaccurate citation — with the verbatim dependency text that
does or does not license it>
WHAT WOULD FIX IT: <the smallest correction you can name, or "not obvious">
```

If, having genuinely tried to refute it, you find nothing fatal, say so plainly
and list what you checked. Finish with one line: `N fatal, M nonfatal`.

A confident empty reading is worse than useless here. Either name a concrete
defect with its quotation, or state clearly that you could not find one.

## Statement

Let $(X,d)$ be a **locally compact** metric space
([[def-locally-compact-metric-space]]) carrying its metric topology, and let $Z$
and $Y$ be topological spaces ([[def-topological-space]]). Give $C(X,Y)$ the
compact-open topology ([[def-compact-open-topology]]) and $X \times Z$ the
product topology ([[def-product-topology]]). Define, for
$f \in C(X \times Z, Y)$,

$$\Phi(f) : Z \to C(X,Y), \qquad \Phi(f)(z)(x) := f(x,z) .$$

Then $\Phi$ is a well-defined map
$C(X \times Z, Y) \to C\big(Z, C(X,Y)\big)$ and it is a **bijection**
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]); its inverse sends a continuous
$F : Z \to C(X,Y)$ to the continuous map $(x,z) \mapsto F(z)(x)$.

### Exactly what is and is not claimed

**This is an assertion about two *sets* of continuous maps and a bijection
between them.** No topology is placed on $C(X \times Z, Y)$ or on
$C(Z, C(X,Y))$ anywhere in the statement, and **it is not claimed that $\Phi$ is
a homeomorphism.** The homeomorphism form of the exponential law is a genuinely
stronger statement, and this library does not have what it needs; the last remark
below says exactly what is missing. A reader who wants the categorical slogan
"$Y^{X \times Z} \cong (Y^{X})^{Z}$" should read it here as a bijection of
underlying sets, natural in the evident way, and no more.

No choice principle is used.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A locally compact metric space $(X,d)$ with its metric topology, topological spaces $Z$ and $Y$, the set $C(X,Y)$ with the compact-open topology, the evaluation map $e : C(X,Y) \times X \to Y$ ([[def-evaluation-map]]), and the assignment $\Phi$ of the Statement.

[L1] If $f : X \times Z \to Y$ is continuous then $\Phi(f)(z) \in C(X,Y)$ for every $z$, and $\Phi(f) : Z \to C(X,Y)$ is continuous for the compact-open topology ([[thm-exponential-correspondence-is-continuous]]).

[L2] $e$ is continuous, $X$ being locally compact ([[thm-evaluation-is-continuous-on-a-locally-compact-metric-domain]], [[def-evaluation-map]]).

[L3] A map into a product is continuous exactly when both its components are, and the projections of a product are continuous ([[thm-product-universal-property]], claims 1 and 2, [[def-product-topology]]).

[L4] A composite of continuous maps is continuous ([[lem-continuity-is-local-and-pastes]], claim 1); and continuity is preimages of open sets being open ([[def-continuous-map-top]], [[thm-continuity-characterisations-top]]).

[L5] Two functions with the same domain are equal exactly when they take the same value at every point of it; an element of $X \times Z$ is determined by its two coordinates ([[def-product-topology]], [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L6] A map is a bijection exactly when it is injective and surjective ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $f \in C(X \times Z, Y)$; by [L1] each $\Phi(f)(z)$ lies in $C(X,Y)$ and $\Phi(f)$ is a continuous map $Z \to C(X,Y)$, so $\Phi(f) \in C(Z, C(X,Y))$ and $\Phi$ is well defined. [L1]

1.2 Let $F \in C(Z, C(X,Y))$ and define $\Psi(F) : X \times Z \to Y$ by $\Psi(F)(x,z) := F(z)(x)$; this is a function, $F(z)$ being an element of $C(X,Y)$ and hence a function $X \to Y$. [L5, construct]

2.1 Let $h : X \times Z \to C(X,Y) \times X$ be given by $h(x,z) := (F(z), x)$; its two components are $(x,z) \mapsto F(z)$, which is the composite of the projection onto $Z$ with $F$, and $(x,z) \mapsto x$, which is the projection onto $X$; both are continuous, so $h$ is continuous. [step 1.2, L3, L4]

2.2 $\Phi$ is injective: if $\Phi(f) = \Phi(f')$ then for all $x \in X$ and $z \in Z$ we get $f(x,z) = \Phi(f)(z)(x) = \Phi(f')(z)(x) = f'(x,z)$, so $f = f'$. [step 1.1, L5]

3.1 $\Psi(F) = e \circ h$, since $(e \circ h)(x,z) = e(F(z), x) = F(z)(x) = \Psi(F)(x,z)$ for every $(x,z)$; hence $\Psi(F)$ is continuous, that is $\Psi(F) \in C(X \times Z, Y)$. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L2, L4, L5]

4.1 $\Phi$ is surjective: given $F \in C(Z,C(X,Y))$, step 3.1 puts $\Psi(F)$ in $C(X \times Z, Y)$, and for all $z \in Z$ and $x \in X$ we have $\Phi(\Psi(F))(z)(x) = \Psi(F)(x,z) = F(z)(x)$, so $\Phi(\Psi(F))(z) = F(z)$ for every $z$ and hence $\Phi(\Psi(F)) = F$. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L5]

5.1 By steps 2.2 and 4.1 the map $\Phi$ is a bijection from $C(X \times Z, Y)$ onto $C(Z, C(X,Y))$, and step 4.1 identifies its inverse as $\Psi$, that is $F \mapsto ((x,z) \mapsto F(z)(x))$. [step 2.2, step 4.1, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where each hypothesis is spent.** Continuity of $\Phi(f)$, which is injectivity's half of the correspondence, needs nothing beyond compactness being available for subsets of $X$ ([[thm-exponential-correspondence-is-continuous]]). Surjectivity is where local compactness enters, and it enters once, through continuity of the evaluation map at step 3.1 ([[thm-evaluation-is-continuous-on-a-locally-compact-metric-domain]]). Without it the map $\Psi(F)$ need not be continuous and $\Phi$ need not be onto.

- **What the homeomorphism form would additionally need, stated precisely.** To say that $\Phi$ is a homeomorphism one must first topologise both sides, which means giving $C(X \times Z, Y)$ a compact-open topology built over the compact subsets of $X \times Z$, and $C(Z, C(X,Y))$ one built over the compact subsets of $Z$. Neither is available here, and not for want of a notion of compactness: compactness for an arbitrary topological space ([[def-compact-space]]) and the tube lemma for a compact factor of an arbitrary product ([[lem-tube-lemma-for-a-compact-factor]]) are both developed earlier in the reading order, so "compact subset of $Z$" and "compact subset of $X \times Z$" do have meaning. What is missing is the topology itself: [[def-compact-open-topology]] is stated for a **metric** domain, whereas $Z$ here is an arbitrary topological space and $X \times Z$ carries no metric, so neither side is topologised by anything on this page. Beyond that, the direction that $\Phi^{-1}$ is continuous also needs that a compact subset of $X \times Z$ be covered by finitely many products of compacta, which this library does not prove. None of that is done here, and nothing above assumes it.

- **The bijection is what the name usually denotes.** Most treatments state the exponential law first as this correspondence and only afterwards ask when it is a homeomorphism, the answer requiring hypotheses on $Z$ as well as on $X$. The scope taken here is therefore the standard first form, and it is stated as such rather than as a weakened version of something else.

- **The companion page traces the correspondence through an explicit example**, the multiplication map on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ and its transpose, and checks both halves by hand.

## The dependencies it declares, quoted verbatim from disk

Each block below is the claim-bearing text of one declared dependency.
These are the only statements the item is entitled to use. If a step
needs more than the text below gives, that is the defect — quote the
dependency text and show exactly what it fails to supply.

### `thm-exponential-correspondence-is-continuous` — theorem — If $f : X \\times Z \\to Y$ is continuous then its transpose $F : Z \\to C(X,Y)$, $F(z)(x) = f(x,z)$, is continuous for the compact-open topology, with no hypothesis on $X$ beyond being metric

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space carrying its metric topology
([[def-metric-topology]], [[def-metrizable-space]]), let $Z$ and $Y$ be
topological spaces ([[def-topological-space]]), and let

$$f : X \times Z \to Y$$

be continuous, the product carrying the product topology
([[def-product-topology]]). For $z \in Z$ define $F(z) : X \to Y$ by
$F(z)(x) := f(x,z)$. Then:

1. $F(z) \in C(X,Y)$ for every $z \in Z$;
2. the **transpose** $F : Z \to C(X,Y)$ is continuous when $C(X,Y)$ carries the
   compact-open topology ([[def-compact-open-topology]]).

**No local compactness and no separation hypothesis is used**, on any of the
three spaces; $X$ is metric only because the compact-open topology is defined
here over the compact subsets of a metric space. No choice principle is used.

### `thm-evaluation-is-continuous-on-a-locally-compact-metric-domain` — theorem — If $X$ is a locally compact metric space then the evaluation map is continuous for the compact-open topology

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $(X,d)$ be a **locally compact** metric space
([[def-locally-compact-metric-space]]) carrying its metric topology, let
$(Y,\mathcal{T}_Y)$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]), and give
$C(X,Y)$ the compact-open topology ([[def-compact-open-topology]]). Then the
evaluation map

$$e : C(X,Y) \times X \to Y, \qquad e(f,x) = f(x)$$

([[def-evaluation-map]]) is continuous, the product carrying the product topology
([[def-product-topology]]).

**No hypothesis whatever is placed on $Y$**, which is an arbitrary topological
space: the argument uses only that a point of $Y$ lies in an open set. No choice
principle is used.

**Local compactness is not removable.** This page records as a false statement
that the evaluation map is continuous for every metric domain, and its witness is
$X = \mathbb{Q}$, a metric space that is locally compact at no point.

### `def-evaluation-map` — definition — The evaluation map $e : C(X,Y) \\times X \\to Y$, $e(f,x) = f(x)$

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space carrying its metric topology
([[def-metric-topology]], [[def-metrizable-space]]), let $(Y,\mathcal{T}_Y)$ be a
topological space ([[def-topological-space]]), and let $C(X,Y)$ carry the
compact-open topology ([[def-compact-open-topology]]). The **evaluation map** is

$$e : C(X,Y) \times X \longrightarrow Y, \qquad e(f,x) := f(x),$$

the domain carrying the product topology ([[def-product-topology]]) of the
compact-open topology on $C(X,Y)$ and the metric topology on $X$.

**This is a function.** For $f \in C(X,Y)$ and $x \in X$ the value $f(x)$ is a
well-determined element of $Y$, and a pair $(f,x)$ of the product determines both
entries ([[def-product-topology]]), so $e$ is defined on all of
$C(X,Y) \times X$ with no further condition.

**Which topology is meant is part of the definition.** Continuity of $e$ is a
statement about the pair of topologies on the source and the topology on the
target ([[def-continuous-map-top]]), and $C(X,Y)$ carries several topologies on
this page. Unless another is named, the topology on $C(X,Y)$ inside an evaluation
map is the compact-open one; where a subspace of $C(X,Y)$ is evaluated, it carries
the subspace topology ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]).

**Separate continuity is immediate; joint continuity is not.** For fixed
$f \in C(X,Y)$ the map $x \mapsto e(f,x) = f(x)$ is continuous, being $f$ itself.
For fixed $x \in X$ the map $f \mapsto e(f,x) = f(x)$ is continuous as well, since
for open $V \subseteq Y$ its preimage is $S(\{x\},V)$, a subbasic open set of the
compact-open topology, $\{x\}$ being compact ([[def-compact-open-topology]]).
What is at issue on this page is **joint** continuity, that is continuity of $e$
on the product, and that genuinely needs a hypothesis on $X$: it holds when $X$ is
locally compact, and this page records as a false statement that it holds for
every metric $X$, with an explicit witness.

### `def-compact-open-topology` — definition — The compact-open topology on $C(X,Y)$ for a metric domain $X$, with subbasis $S(K,V) = \\{f : f[K] \\subseteq V\\}$

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]) carrying its metric topology
([[def-metric-topology]], [[def-metrizable-space]]), let $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be
a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]), and let

$$C(X,Y) \;=\; \{\, f : X \to Y \;:\; f \text{ is continuous} \,\}$$

([[def-continuous-map-top]]). For a compact subset $K \subseteq X$
([[def-metric-compactness]]) and an open $V \in \mathcal{T}_Y$ put

$$S(K,V) \;:=\; \{\, f \in C(X,Y) \;:\; f[K] \subseteq V \,\} \;=\; \{\, f \in C(X,Y) : f(x) \in V \text{ for every } x \in K \,\} .$$

The **compact-open topology** on $C(X,Y)$ is the topology generated by

$$\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{co}} \;:=\; \{\, S(K,V) \;:\; K \subseteq X \text{ compact},\ V \in \mathcal{T}_Y \,\}$$

as a subbasis ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]). By [[thm-basis-criterion]] the
finite intersections

$$S(K_0,V_0) \cap \dots \cap S(K_{n-1},V_{n-1}) \qquad (n \in \mathbb{N})$$

form a basis for it, the value $n = 0$ giving the empty intersection $C(X,Y)$.
Nothing has to be checked for this to be a topology: a topology generated by an
arbitrary family exists and is the coarsest one containing it
([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]).

**Two degenerate members, recorded because they are used.** $S(\varnothing, V) = C(X,Y)$
for every open $V$, the empty set being compact and $f[\varnothing] = \varnothing$;
and $S(K, Y) = C(X,Y)$ for every compact $K$. Both are the whole space, so neither
constrains anything, and arguments below dispose of them separately rather than
dividing by a distance that does not exist.

**The domain is metric, and the target is not.** Compactness of $K$ is
[[def-metric-compactness]], which is defined for subsets of a metric space and,
at this point in the reading order, for nothing else; that is why $X$ carries a
metric here. The target $Y$ needs only its open sets, so it is an arbitrary
topological space throughout this definition and wherever the compact-open
topology alone is in play. Where a distance in the target is used — the uniform
metric, compact convergence, the comparison theorem — $Y$ is required to be
metric and the requirement is stated.

**Compactness of $K$ is intrinsic** ([[def-metric-compactness]]): it means that
the metric subspace $(K, d_K)$ is a compact metric space. The equivalent
description by families of open subsets of $X$ covering $K$ is
[[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]], and it is cited at every step that uses it.

**Notation.** The letter $S$ carries two unrelated meanings in this library:
$S(x,r)$ is the sphere of centre $x$ and radius $r$ in a metric space
([[def-metric-ball]]), and $S(K,V)$ is the set defined above. The two are never
ambiguous, because the first argument of a sphere is a point and its second a
positive real, while the first argument of $S(K,V)$ is a compact set and its
second an open set; no item on this page writes a sphere.

### `def-locally-compact-metric-space` — definition — Locally compact metric space: every point has a compact neighbourhood

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]), with balls as in
[[def-metric-ball]] and compact subsets as in [[def-metric-compactness]].

$(X,d)$ is **locally compact** if for every $x \in X$ there are a compact subset
$K \subseteq X$ and a real $r > 0$ with

$$B(x,r) \;\subseteq\; K .$$

**This is the condition "every point has a compact neighbourhood", written out.**
Give $X$ its metric topology $\mathcal{T}_d$ ([[def-metric-topology]]), so that
$(X, \mathcal{T}_d)$ is a topological space ([[def-metrizable-space]]). A set
$K \subseteq X$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ in the sense of
[[def-neighbourhood-top]] exactly when some open $U$ satisfies
$x \in U \subseteq K$, and by [[def-metric-topology]] that holds exactly when some
ball $B(x,r)$ satisfies $B(x,r) \subseteq K$. So the displayed condition says
precisely that $x$ has a compact neighbourhood, and the two readings are the same
condition and not two notions.

**Two conventions are fixed here, because both are live in the literature.**

- *Neighbourhoods need not be open.* This library's convention is
  [[def-neighbourhood-top]]'s, and it is what makes "compact neighbourhood" a
  useful phrase at all: a compact set is rarely open. Note that
  [[def-metric-topology]] uses the word *neighbourhood* for an open set
  containing the point; that narrower usage is confined to that item, and the
  present definition never relies on it.
- *Compactness of a subset is intrinsic.* $K$ compact means the metric subspace
  $(K, d_K)$ is a compact metric space ([[def-metric-compactness]],
  [[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]); the equivalent description by families
  of open subsets of the ambient $X$ is [[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]] and is
  cited wherever it is used.

**Every compact metric space is locally compact**, since $K := X$ and any $r > 0$
serve at every point. The empty metric space is locally compact, the condition
being vacuous.

### `def-product-topology` — definition — The product set $\\prod_{i \\in I} X_i$ of functions choosing a point in each factor, the projections, the box topology, and the product topology as the initial topology of the projections; the empty product is a one-point space

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

**The product set.** Let $I$ be a set and let $X_i$ be a set for each $i \in I$.
The **product** is

$$\prod_{i \in I} X_i \;:=\; \Big\{\, x : x \text{ is a function with domain } I \text{ and } x(i) \in X_i \text{ for every } i \in I \,\Big\},$$

and we write $x_i := x(i)$, the $i$-th **coordinate** of $x$. Two elements of the
product are equal exactly when they agree at every index, functions being equal
when they have the same domain and the same values. For $j \in I$ the $j$-th
**projection** is

$$\pi_j : \prod_{i \in I} X_i \to X_j, \qquad \pi_j(x) := x_j .$$

**Notation for a finite product.** For $I = n$ a natural number, which is the set
$\{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ of its predecessors, an element of $\prod_{k<n} X_k$ is a
function on $n$ and we write it $(x_0, \dots, x_{n-1})$. In particular $I = 2$
gives the **binary product**, written $X \times Y$ for $\prod_{i<2} X_i$ with
$X_0 = X$ and $X_1 = Y$, whose elements are written $(u,v)$ for the function
$0 \mapsto u$, $1 \mapsto v$. This is the only meaning the symbol $X \times Y$
carries on this page.

**Two facts about when the product is nonempty, stated because they are used and
because they cost something.** If some $X_{i_0}$ is empty then the product is
empty, since no function can take a value in $X_{i_0}$. Conversely, suppose every
$X_i$ is nonempty.

- For $I = n$ a natural number, the product is nonempty, and this is a theorem of
  ZF: [[lem-finite-choice]] applied to the function $i \mapsto X_i$ on $n$
  supplies a choice function $g$ for the family of values, and
  $x(i) := g(X_i)$ defines a member of $\prod_{k<n} X_k$.
- For an arbitrary $I$ the assertion "$\prod_{i \in I} X_i \ne \varnothing$
  whenever every $X_i$ is nonempty" **is** the Axiom of Choice: it is the
  formulation recorded in [[def-axiom-of-choice]], and the choice function of
  [[def-choice-function]] is exactly a point of the product of a family by
  itself. Every use of it below is flagged at the step that spends it.

**The box topology.** Now let each $X_i$ carry a topology $\mathcal{T}_i$
([[def-topological-space]]). Put

$$\mathcal{R} \;:=\; \Big\{\, \prod_{i \in I} U_i \;:\; U_i \in \mathcal{T}_i \text{ for every } i \in I \,\Big\},$$

the family of **boxes**. $\mathcal{R}$ is a basis for a topology
([[thm-basis-criterion]]): it contains $\prod_i X_i$, so it covers the product,
and it is closed under binary intersections, since

$$\Big(\prod_i U_i\Big) \cap \Big(\prod_i V_i\Big) = \prod_i (U_i \cap V_i)$$

and each $U_i \cap V_i$ is open by (T3). The topology it generates is the **box
topology** $\mathcal{T}^{\square}$, and $\mathcal{R}$ is a basis for it
([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]).

**The product topology.** The **product topology** $\mathcal{T}^{\Pi}$ on
$\prod_i X_i$ is the initial topology of the family of projections
$(\pi_i)_{i \in I}$ ([[def-initial-and-final-topology]]): the topology generated
by the subbasis

$$\mathcal{G} \;:=\; \{\, \pi_i^{-1}[U] : i \in I,\ U \in \mathcal{T}_i \,\}, \qquad \pi_i^{-1}[U] = \prod_{j \in I} W_j \ \text{ with } W_i = U \text{ and } W_j = X_j \text{ for } j \ne i .$$

By [[thm-basis-criterion]] the finite intersections of members of $\mathcal{G}$
form a basis for $\mathcal{T}^{\Pi}$, and those finite intersections are exactly
the boxes with all but finitely many factors unrestricted:

$$\mathcal{R}^{\Pi} \;=\; \Big\{\, \prod_{i \in I} U_i \;:\; U_i \in \mathcal{T}_i \text{ for every } i, \text{ and } U_i = X_i \text{ for all but finitely many } i \,\Big\}.$$

Indeed the intersection of $\pi_{i_1}^{-1}[U_1], \dots, \pi_{i_n}^{-1}[U_n]$ is
the box whose factor at $i$ is the intersection of those $U_m$ with $i_m = i$ and
is $X_i$ when no $i_m$ equals $i$; and the intersection of no members is the
whole product, the box with every factor $X_i$. Conversely a box with
$U_i = X_i$ off a finite set is such an intersection. Members of
$\mathcal{R}^{\Pi}$ are called **basic product-open** sets, and members of
$\mathcal{R}$ **boxes**. So $\mathcal{R}^{\Pi} \subseteq \mathcal{R}$, with
equality when $I$ is a natural number.

**The empty product.** For $I = \varnothing$ there is exactly one function with
domain $\varnothing$, the empty function, so $\prod_{i \in \varnothing} X_i$ is a
one-point set. A one-point set carries exactly one topology, namely
$\{\varnothing, \{\varnothing\}\}$, since a topology must contain the empty set
and the whole set and there is nothing else to contain
([[def-topological-space]]); so the box topology and the product topology agree
there, and both equal the discrete topology and the indiscrete topology
([[def-standard-topologies]]), which coincide on a one-point set. There are no
projections to speak of, and the initial topology of the empty family is indeed
the indiscrete one ([[def-initial-and-final-topology]]).

**Convention.** Unless the box topology is named explicitly, $\prod_i X_i$ always
carries the product topology in this library. That is not a matter of taste: the
product topology is the one with the characteristic property of the next item,
and the box topology has no such property.

### `thm-product-universal-property` — theorem — A map into a product is continuous iff each of its components is; the projections are continuous and open; and each projection is surjective when every factor is nonempty, which for an infinite index set uses the Axiom of Choice

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $(X_i, \mathcal{T}_i)_{i \in I}$ be topological spaces and let
$P := \prod_{i \in I} X_i$ carry the product topology, with projections $\pi_j$
([[def-product-topology]]). Then:

1. **The projections are continuous**, and the product topology is the coarsest
   topology on $P$ making all of them continuous.
2. **Characteristic property.** For every space $Z$ and every function
   $h : Z \to P$,
   $$h \text{ is continuous } \iff \pi_i \circ h \text{ is continuous for every } i \in I .$$
   The functions $\pi_i \circ h$ are the **components** of $h$, and every family
   of functions $h_i : Z \to X_i$ arises from exactly one $h$, namely
   $h(z)(i) := h_i(z)$.
3. **The projections are open maps** ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]), for
   the product topology and for the box topology alike. They need not be closed;
   that failure is recorded on this page as a false statement.
4. **Surjectivity.** If every $X_i$ is nonempty then every $\pi_j$ is surjective.
   For $I$ a natural number this is a theorem of ZF ([[lem-finite-choice]]); for
   an arbitrary $I$ it is the Axiom of Choice ([[def-axiom-of-choice]]), and this
   is the only place in the item where a choice principle is used.

### `def-continuous-map-top` — definition — Continuity of a map of topological spaces at a point and globally

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be topological spaces
([[def-topological-space]]), let $f : X \to Y$ be a function and let $x \in X$.
Neighbourhoods are as in [[def-neighbourhood-top]].

$f$ is **continuous at $x$** if for every neighbourhood $V$ of $f(x)$ in $Y$ the
preimage $f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ in $X$.

$f$ is **continuous** if it is continuous at every point of $X$.

**The same condition with open sets only.** $f$ is continuous at $x$ if and only
if for every open $V \subseteq Y$ with $f(x) \in V$ there is an open
$U \subseteq X$ with $x \in U$ and $f[U] \subseteq V$. Indeed, if $f$ is
continuous at $x$ and $V$ is such an open set, then $V$ is a neighbourhood of
$f(x)$, so $f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ and contains an open $U \ni x$,
which satisfies $f[U] \subseteq V$. Conversely, given the displayed condition and
a neighbourhood $V$ of $f(x)$, fix open $V_0$ with $f(x) \in V_0 \subseteq V$ and
then open $U \ni x$ with $f[U] \subseteq V_0$; then $x \in U \subseteq f^{-1}[V_0] \subseteq f^{-1}[V]$,
so $f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$. Both forms are used below and are the
same statement written twice.

**Preimage, not image.** $f^{-1}[V] = \{\, x \in X : f(x) \in V \,\}$
is the preimage in the sense of [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]] and is
defined for every function, invertible or not; no inverse function is being
asserted to exist. Continuity is a condition on preimages throughout, and the
corresponding conditions on images define the *open* and *closed* maps of a later
item, which are different notions.

### `lem-continuity-is-local-and-pastes` — lemma — Continuity may be checked on any open cover, and on any finite closed cover; composites of continuous maps are continuous

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ be topological spaces, with subspaces carrying the subspace
topology ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]). Then:

1. **Composites.** If $f : X \to Y$ and $g : Y \to Z$ are continuous
   ([[def-continuous-map-top]]) then $g \circ f : X \to Z$ is continuous.
2. **Open cover.** Let $f : X \to Y$ be a function and let
   $\{\, U_i : i \in I \,\}$ be a family of open subsets of $X$ with
   $\bigcup_{i \in I} U_i = X$. If $f|_{U_i} : U_i \to Y$ is continuous for every
   $i \in I$, then $f$ is continuous.
3. **Finite closed cover.** Let $f : X \to Y$ be a function, let $n \ge 1$ and
   let $F_1, \dots, F_n$ be closed subsets of $X$ with
   $F_1 \cup \dots \cup F_n = X$. If $f|_{F_k} : F_k \to Y$ is continuous for
   every $k$, then $f$ is continuous.

The converses of claims 2 and 3 hold with no hypothesis on the cover at all:
every restriction of a continuous map to a subspace is continuous
([[def-subspace-topology-top]]). The finiteness in claim 3 is not removable; see
the remarks.

### `def-injection-surjection-bijection` — definition — Injection, surjection, bijection

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets and let $f : A \to B$ be a function.

- $f$ is **injective** (one-to-one) if $f(x) = f(y)$ implies $x = y$, for all
  $x, y \in A$.
- $f$ is **surjective** (onto) if for every $b \in B$ there is some $x \in A$
  with $f(x) = b$; equivalently, the image $f[A] := \{ f(x) : x \in A \}$ equals
  $B$.
- $f$ is **bijective** if it is both injective and surjective.

For $S \subseteq A$ we write $f[S] = \{ f(x) : x \in S \}$ for the image of $S$,
and for $T \subseteq B$ we write $f^{-1}[T] = \{ x \in A : f(x) \in T \}$ for the
preimage of $T$.

### `def-topological-space` — definition — Topology on a set, open and closed sets, clopen sets, the closed-set axiomatisation, and the coarser/finer comparison

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $X$ be a set and write $\mathcal{P}(X)$ for its power set. A **topology** on
$X$ is a family $\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ such that

- **(T1)** $\varnothing \in \mathcal{T}$ and $X \in \mathcal{T}$;
- **(T2)** $\bigcup \mathcal{S} \in \mathcal{T}$ for every $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$;
- **(T3)** $U \cap V \in \mathcal{T}$ for all $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$.

A **topological space** is a pair $(X, \mathcal{T})$ consisting of a set $X$ and
a topology $\mathcal{T}$ on it; the elements of $X$ are its **points**. When only
one topology is in play we write $X$ for the pair; when several are, the topology
is always named.

The members of $\mathcal{T}$ are the **open** sets of $(X,\mathcal{T})$. A subset
$F \subseteq X$ is **closed** when its complement $X \setminus F$ is open, and
**clopen** when it is both open and closed. By (T1) both $\varnothing$ and $X$
are clopen. *Open and closed are not opposites*: a set may be neither, and it may
be both, so "not open" is never a synonym for "closed".

**Finite intersections, and the empty one.** Axiom (T3) is stated for two sets
because that is all that is ever needed: if $n \ge 1$ and
$U_1, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{T}$, then $U_1 \cap \dots \cap U_n \in \mathcal{T}$
follows by iterating (T3) $n-1$ times. The intersection of the **empty** family
of subsets of $X$ is $X$, since the condition "lies in every member of the empty
family" is vacuous; that case is covered by (T1) rather than by (T3), which is
one of the two reasons $X \in \mathcal{T}$ is demanded outright. The other is
that (T2) alone gives only $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$.

**The closed sets, and the dual axiomatisation.** Put
$\mathcal{C} := \{\, X \setminus U : U \in \mathcal{T} \,\}$, the family of closed
sets. Then

- **(C1)** $\varnothing \in \mathcal{C}$ and $X \in \mathcal{C}$;
- **(C2)** $\bigcap \mathcal{D} \in \mathcal{C}$ for every **nonempty**
  $\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$;
- **(C3)** $C \cup D \in \mathcal{C}$ for all $C, D \in \mathcal{C}$.

Conversely, if a family $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ satisfies (C1),
(C2) and (C3), then $\mathcal{T} := \{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{C} \,\}$
is a topology on $X$ whose closed sets are exactly the members of $\mathcal{C}$.
So a topology may be presented equally well by its open sets or by its closed
sets, and this library uses whichever is shorter.

*Both directions are one computation, and it is carried out here rather than
assumed.* The map $U \mapsto X \setminus U$ is an involution of
$\mathcal{P}(X)$, hence a bijection, and it carries the two De Morgan identities

$$X \setminus \bigcup_{i \in I} A_i = \bigcap_{i \in I} (X \setminus A_i) \quad (I \ne \varnothing), \qquad X \setminus \bigcap_{i \in I} A_i = \bigcup_{i \in I} (X \setminus A_i) \quad (I \ne \varnothing)$$

term by term into each other. Given (T1)–(T3): $\varnothing = X \setminus X$ and
$X = X \setminus \varnothing$ lie in $\mathcal{C}$, which is (C1); for nonempty
$\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$ the family
$\mathcal{S} = \{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{D} \,\}$ lies in $\mathcal{T}$
and $\bigcap \mathcal{D} = X \setminus \bigcup \mathcal{S}$ is closed by (T2),
which is (C2); and $C \cup D = X \setminus ((X \setminus C) \cap (X \setminus D))$
is closed by (T3), which is (C3). Given (C1)–(C3) the same three lines run
backwards, the empty-union case $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$ being supplied
by (C1) rather than by (C2); and $\{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{C} \,\}$ has
$\mathcal{C}$ as its family of complements because complementation is an
involution.

**Comparison of topologies.** If $\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ are
topologies on the same set $X$ and $\mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2$, then
$\mathcal{T}_1$ is **coarser** than $\mathcal{T}_2$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ is
**finer** than $\mathcal{T}_1$; the comparison is **strict** when the inclusion
is. Inclusion is a partial order on the set of topologies on $X$
([[def-partial-order]]), and it is not a total one: two topologies on the same
set may be incomparable.

### `def-metric-space` — definition — Metric space: $d(x,y) = 0$ iff $x = y$, symmetry, and the triangle inequality; pseudometric and ultrametric

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) constructed in this
library ([[def-real-numbers]]) and carrying its order ([[def-real-order]]).

Let $X$ be a set. A **metric** on $X$ is a function
$d : X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $x, y, z \in X$:

- **(M1) Separation.** $d(x,y) = 0$ if and only if $x = y$.
- **(M2) Symmetry.** $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$.
- **(M3) Triangle inequality.** $d(x,z) \le d(x,y) + d(y,z)$.

A **metric space** is a pair $(X,d)$ consisting of a set $X$ and a metric $d$ on
it. The elements of $X$ are its **points** and $d(x,y)$ is the **distance** from
$x$ to $y$. When only one metric is in play we write $X$ for $(X,d)$; when
several are, the metric is always named.

**The values of a metric are real numbers.** The codomain is $\mathbb{R}$, so
$d(x,y)$ is an honest element of the complete ordered field and every
inequality above is an inequality there. No infinite value is permitted;
[[rem-metric-axiom-conventions]] records why extended metrics are not treated in
this library.

**Nonnegativity is deliberately absent from the axiom list.** Many texts add a
fourth axiom $d(x,y) \ge 0$. It is redundant: (M1), (M2) and (M3) already force
it, as [[lem-metric-nonnegativity]] proves. Nothing below assumes it before that
lemma is available.

**Pseudometric.** A **pseudometric** on $X$ is a function
$p : X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying (M2), (M3) and the weakening

- **(M1') Reflexivity.** $p(x,x) = 0$ for every $x \in X$

of (M1). A pseudometric may therefore assign distance $0$ to two distinct
points. Every metric is a pseudometric, and a pseudometric is a metric exactly
when $p(x,y) = 0$ forces $x = y$.

**Ultrametric.** An **ultrametric** on $X$ is a metric $d$ that in addition
satisfies

- **(M3') Strong triangle inequality.** $d(x,z) \le \max\{d(x,y), d(y,z)\}$

for all $x, y, z \in X$, where the maximum is that of a two-element subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, which exists and is one of the two elements
([[def-max-min]], [[lem-finite-set-has-max]]). An **ultrametric space** is a pair
$(X,d)$ with $d$ an ultrametric.

### `def-metric-topology` — definition — The metric topology: a set is open when every one of its points has a ball around it inside the set; closed means open complement

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]).

A subset $U \subseteq X$ is **open in $(X,d)$** if for every $x \in U$ there is a
real $r > 0$ with $B(x,r) \subseteq U$ ([[def-metric-ball]]). A subset
$F \subseteq X$ is **closed in $(X,d)$** if its complement $X \setminus F$ is
open.

The collection

$$\mathcal{T}_d := \{\, U \subseteq X : U \text{ is open in } (X,d) \,\}$$

of all open subsets is the **metric topology** of $d$ on $X$. A subset of $X$
that is both open and closed is called **clopen**.

**Two sets are open for trivial reasons.** $\emptyset$ is open, because the
defining condition quantifies over no points; and $X$ is open, because
$B(x,r) \subseteq X$ for every $x$ and every $r > 0$. Consequently $X$ and
$\emptyset$ are also closed, and both are clopen.

**A neighbourhood of a point $x$** is any open set containing $x$. The condition
above therefore reads: $U$ is open exactly when every point of $U$ has a ball
around it inside $U$, and it is the balls alone that have to be tested.

**The metric, not the set, determines $\mathcal{T}_d$.** Two metrics on the same
set may have different metric topologies, and two different metrics may have the
same one; the systematic comparison is [[def-equivalent-metrics]].

### `def-metrizable-space` — definition — Metrizable space: a topological space whose topology is induced by some metric; metrizability is topological, the metric is not

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ ([[def-topological-space]]) is
**metrizable** if there is a metric $d$ on $X$ ([[def-metric-space]]) whose
metric topology is $\mathcal{T}$, that is $\mathcal{T} = \mathcal{T}_d$
([[def-metric-topology]]). Such a $d$ is said to **induce** or **metrise**
$\mathcal{T}$.

**The definition presupposes that $\mathcal{T}_d$ is a topology in the sense of
[[def-topological-space]], and it is.** By [[def-metric-topology]] both
$\varnothing$ and $X$ are open in $(X,d)$, which is (T1), and by
[[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]] the family $\mathcal{T}_d$ is closed under
arbitrary unions, which is (T2), and under intersections of $n \ge 1$ members,
which contains (T3). So every metric space is a topological space, and the
metric-space development of this library is a special case of the present one.

**The standard local notions in the two developments agree after translating
their neighbourhood conventions.** Let $d$ be a metric on $X$ and give $X$ the
topology $\mathcal{T}_d$.

- *Neighbourhoods and balls.* [[def-metric-topology]] uses "neighbourhood" for
  an open set containing $x$, whereas [[def-neighbourhood-top]] also allows a
  non-open superset of such a set. Thus the two collections are not literally
  equal, but the open metric neighbourhoods are cofinal in the broader
  neighbourhood filter. The balls $B(x,r)$, $r > 0$ ([[def-metric-ball]]), are
  open ([[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]]) and form a neighbourhood base at $x$:
  any neighbourhood $N$ contains an open $U \ni x$, hence a ball around $x$ by
  [[def-metric-topology]]. The balls of radius $1/n$ alone already suffice
  ([[lem-metric-ball-neighbourhood-base]]).
- *Interior, closure, boundary.* [[def-metric-interior-closure-boundary]] defines
  them by the same conditions with balls in place of neighbourhoods, and the
  previous bullet makes the two conditions equivalent; the metric closure is the
  smallest closed superset ([[thm-metric-closure-characterisation]]), which is the
  definition used here ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]). So the two
  closures, the two interiors and the two boundaries are the same three
  operations.
- *Convergence.* $x_k \to p$ in the sense of [[def-sequence-convergence-top]] is
  "eventually in every neighbourhood of $p$", and by the first bullet this is
  "eventually in every ball around $p$", which is [[def-metric-convergence]].
- *Continuity.* $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ continuity at $a$
  ([[def-metric-continuity]]) says that every ball around $f(a)$ has a ball
  around $a$ mapped into it, which by the first bullet is continuity at $a$ in
  the sense of [[def-continuous-map-top]].

- *Subspaces.* For $A \subseteq X$ the subspace topology
  $\{\, U \cap A : U \in \mathcal{T}_d \,\}$ of [[def-subspace-topology-top]] is
  exactly the metric topology of the subspace metric $d_A$
  ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]), so the two uses of the phrase
  *subspace topology* in this library name one thing. Indeed
  $B_A(a,r) = B_X(a,r) \cap A$: a trace $U \cap A$ is $d_A$-open, since each of
  its points $a$ has $B_X(a,r) \subseteq U$ and hence $B_A(a,r) \subseteq U \cap A$;
  and a $d_A$-open $W$ is the trace of
  $U := \bigcup \{\, B_X(a,r) : a \in W,\ r > 0,\ B_X(a,r) \cap A \subseteq W \,\}$,
  which is $d_X$-open, satisfies $U \cap A = W$, and involves no choice principle,
  the union being taken over a set of pairs rather than over a selection.

Consequently the metric-space notions of interior, closure, boundary, density,
convergence, continuity and subspace agree with the topological notions here,
and statements about them transfer once a metric is named. For neighbourhoods
the transfer uses the explicit convention change above: a metric-page
neighbourhood is an open topological neighbourhood, while every topological
neighbourhood contains one.

**Metrizability is a topological property; the metric is not part of it.** If
$h : X \to Y$ is a homeomorphism ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]) and $d$
metrises $X$, then $d'(y_1,y_2) := d(h^{-1}(y_1), h^{-1}(y_2))$ is a metric on
$Y$ — the three axioms transfer along the bijection $h^{-1}$ — and
$h[B_d(x,r)] = B_{d'}(h(x), r)$, so $h$ carries a basis of $\mathcal{T}_d$ to a
basis of $\mathcal{T}_{d'}$ and $\mathcal{T}_{d'} = h[\mathcal{T}_d] = \mathcal{T}_Y$.
Hence $Y$ is metrizable. The metric itself, however, is **not** determined by the
topology: two metrics on one set may induce the same topology without agreeing,
which is exactly topological equivalence ([[def-equivalent-metrics]]), and
properties of a metric that are not properties of its topology, boundedness among
them, are therefore not properties of a metrizable space.

**Two things every metrizable space has.** It is **Hausdorff**: distinct points
have disjoint open neighbourhoods, by [[thm-metric-hausdorff-separation]] applied
to any metric inducing the topology. And it is **first countable**
([[def-first-countable-top]]), by [[lem-metric-ball-neighbourhood-base]]. Either
failure is therefore an obstruction to metrizability, and this page uses the
first of them to exhibit a topology induced by no metric.

**Sequential limits in a metrizable space are unique, so the notation
$\lim_k x_k$ is available there.** In a metric space a sequence has at most one
limit ([[lem-metric-limits-unique]]), and by the agreement of convergence above
that uniqueness is a statement about the topology alone; so within a metrizable
space, and only there, this page writes $\lim_k x_k$ in the ordinary way. In a
general space the symbol is unavailable ([[def-sequence-convergence-top]]).

**The usual topology of $\mathbb{R}$.** The absolute value makes $\mathbb{R}$ a
metric space under $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) = |x-y|$, its open balls are the bounded
open intervals, and the resulting metric topology is what claim 3 of
[[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]] names the **usual topology** of $\mathbb{R}$.
That is the topology meant by the phrase throughout these two pages, and
$\mathbb{R}$ carrying it is metrizable by definition. Every statement about it on
these two pages is proved from the metric $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ and the bridge above,
and no example re-derives any of it.

### `thm-continuity-characterisations-top` — theorem — For a map of spaces the following agree: continuity at every point, preimages of open sets open, preimages of closed sets closed, preimages of subbasic open sets open, and $f(\\overline{A}) \\subseteq \\overline{f(A)}$

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be topological spaces, let
$f : X \to Y$ be a function, and let $\mathcal{S}$ be a subbasis for
$\mathcal{T}_Y$ ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]). The following five conditions
are equivalent.

- **(a)** $f$ is continuous at every point of $X$ ([[def-continuous-map-top]]).
- **(b)** $f^{-1}[V]$ is open in $X$ for every open $V \subseteq Y$.
- **(c)** $f^{-1}[F]$ is closed in $X$ for every closed $F \subseteq Y$.
- **(d)** $f^{-1}[S]$ is open in $X$ for every $S \in \mathcal{S}$.
- **(e)** $f[\overline{A}] \subseteq \overline{f[A]}$ for every $A \subseteq X$,
  closures being taken in $X$ and in $Y$ respectively
  ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

Condition (d) is what makes continuity checkable against a generating family
rather than against every open set, and it holds for a *basis* as well, a basis
being in particular a subbasis for the topology it generates.

### `def-metric-compactness` — definition — Open cover, subcover, compact metric space, and compact subset of a metric space

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]), with open sets as in
[[def-metric-topology]] and balls as in [[def-metric-ball]].

- An **open cover** of $(X,d)$ is a family $\mathcal{U}$ of open subsets of $X$
  with $X = \bigcup \mathcal{U}$, where
  $\bigcup \mathcal{U} = \{\, x \in X : x \in U \text{ for some } U \in \mathcal{U} \,\}$.
- A **subcover** of $\mathcal{U}$ is a subfamily
  $\mathcal{V} \subseteq \mathcal{U}$ that is itself an open cover.
- A family $\mathcal{V}$ of sets is **finite** when $\mathcal{V} = \emptyset$ or
  there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and sets $V_0, \dots, V_n$ with
  $\mathcal{V} = \{V_0, \dots, V_n\}$; repetitions in the list are allowed and
  harmless.
- $(X,d)$ is **compact** when every open cover of it has a finite subcover: for
  every open cover $\mathcal{U}$, either $X = \emptyset$ and the empty subfamily
  covers it, or there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
  $U_0, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{U}$ with
  $$X = U_0 \cup \dots \cup U_n .$$
- A subset $A \subseteq X$ is a **compact subset** of $X$ when the metric
  subspace $(A, d_A)$ is a compact metric space, $d_A$ being the restriction of
  $d$ to $A \times A$ ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]).

**Compactness of a subset is defined intrinsically, and only intrinsically.**
The last clause speaks about the subspace $(A,d_A)$ and its own open sets, not
about families of open subsets of the ambient $X$. The two readings do agree,
but that is a theorem and not a convention: it is
[[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]], and no item of this library may use the
ambient reading without citing it. Taking the intrinsic reading as the
definition is what makes "compact" a property of the metric space $(A,d_A)$
alone, so that a set compact in one ambient space is compact in every other one
containing it isometrically.

**The empty space is compact**, since the empty subfamily of any family covers
it; this is the reason the clause above is written with the two cases. The
one-point space is compact too, and so is every space listed as
$\{x_0, \dots, x_n\}$: given a cover, each $x_i$ lies in some member, and
finitely many members chosen in this way already cover.

**The finiteness convention, and how it is used both ways.** "Finite" above is
the listing form, matching the finite lists of
[[def-finite-intersection-property]]. It agrees with the definition of
finiteness by equinumerosity with a natural number ([[def-countable]]), and
both directions of the agreement are available and are used below:

- A nonempty finite set $F$ in the sense of [[def-countable]] satisfies
  $F \approx m$ for some $m \ge 1$, and a bijection $m \to F$ is exactly a
  listing $F = \{a_0, \dots, a_{m-1}\}$.
- Conversely a set listed as $A = \{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$, that is the image of a
  function $a$ with domain $\sigma(n)$, is finite in the sense of
  [[def-countable]]: the map sending $x \in A$ to the least $i \le n$ with
  $a_i = x$ is an injection of $A$ into $\sigma(n)$, so $A$ is equinumerous with
  a subset of $\mathbb{N}$ bounded above, and such a subset is finite
  ([[lem-subset-of-countable]]).

Neither direction uses a choice principle: the second selects nothing, taking a
least index instead.
