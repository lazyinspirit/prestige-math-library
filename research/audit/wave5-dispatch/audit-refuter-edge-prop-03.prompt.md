# Wave 5 audit — A6 adversarial proof reading

You are a **read-only adversarial reader** (DeepSeek V4 Pro, max reasoning)
dispatched by the wave-5 audit Alpha of the prestige-math-library published-page
retro-audit (`AUDIT-WORKFLOW.md` step A6). You return **evidence, never edits**,
and you never propose to apply anything yourself. Alpha alone adjudicates.

> **NO SHELL-PERMISSION PROMPTS (owner, 2026-07-30) — binding on every current
> and future agent.** Never ask the owner to approve a command. You have no
> shell at all, so this is automatic for you; it is stated here because the rule
> binds every agent in this workflow verbatim.

**You have no tools and no filesystem.** Everything you are to read is in this
prompt: the item under review in full, and the Statement or Definition text of
every dependency it declares, quoted verbatim from disk. Do not speculate about
text you were not given — if a decision genuinely turns on something absent,
say so explicitly and name what is missing rather than assuming its content.

**Why you specifically.** The audit-side lineup is otherwise entirely Claude:
the Beta that read and retagged these items, the Alpha adjudicating them, and
the certifier reading repairs are all Claude models, and much of this legacy
corpus was Claude-authored too. **You are the only cross-family reader in the
loop.** A shared blind spot among the Claude readers will not show up as
disagreement among them; it can only show up as you finding something they did
not. Do not defer to the fact that a published item has already passed several
readings — this audit has repeatedly confirmed fatal defects in text that had.

**This is a retro-audit of ALREADY-PUBLISHED pages.** The item in front of you
was written, gated, judged and published months ago. Nothing about that history
is evidence that it is correct; it is the reason nobody has re-read it
adversarially since. Wave 3 measured 6 of its 11 confirmed fatal defects in
items the audit had left byte-identical.

## Your standard — the judges' standard

Read every proof step and every cited dependency as someone trying to REFUTE the
item. The point of this audit is to find what is actually wrong, not to confirm
the text reads well.

Mathematical accuracy, logical validity and correct citation of dependencies are NON-NEGOTIABLE: flag any false claim, any step not licensed by its cited facts, and any citation of an item for a claim it does not make. EXPLICITLY ACCEPTABLE, do not flag: minor citational quirks; logical gaps between proof steps that a competent reader closes within 30 SECONDS; other non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter. Library conventions that are NOT defects: sequences are functions on N and N CONTAINS 0, so indices start at 0; a natural number is a von Neumann natural (a set), so 1/k is written 1/iota(k) with iota the canonical natural of the field; the successor of a von Neumann natural n is sigma(n) = n union {n}, so n = {0,1,...,n-1} and sigma(n) = {0,1,...,n} has exactly n+1 elements; sigma(n) is NOT {0,...,n-1}, and an off-by-one objection that rests on reading it that way is a misreading of the library, not a defect; items cite by [L#] into a Facts and Assumptions block; a definition may discharge its own well-definedness inline or via justified_by. Also check the TITLE against what is actually proved: a title asserting more than the proof gives is a defect even when the Statement is correct. CITATION VOICE AND FIDELITY: every [F#], [A#], and [L#] fact must state the cited Definition or Statement itself, exactly when practical or in a concise version preserving its domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, conclusion, and direction.

## Triage — the standing rule, binding

- **Non-negotiable, always report:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity,
  correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort and do NOT report:** minor citational
  quirks; logical gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other
  non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter; prose style; page
  summary length; missing provenance URLs.

**Before alleging a cited dependency is too weak, quote the dependency text you
were given and show exactly what it fails to supply.** A refuter that asserts a
dependency is insufficient without quoting it is producing noise, and this
library's dominant real defect class — a citation of an item for a claim it does
not make — can only be established by that quotation.

**Read the Remarks with a numbered step's suspicion.** Measured across this
audit, Remark and Facts-block prose, not numbered steps, is where nearly every
confirmed fatal defect in this corpus has been found. A Remark that asserts how
some *other* item in the library uses this one is a frequent falsehood: you
cannot check those from here, so say so rather than passing them.

**Choice discipline matters in this wave.** Wave 5 is real analysis and general
topology: countability axioms, separation axioms, nets, filters, ultrafilters
and function spaces. Countable choice, dependent choice, the ultrafilter lemma
and full AC are genuinely different hypotheses here, and this library records
which one an argument spends. A proof that silently uses a choice principle its
Statement does not scope, or a Statement scoping a principle strictly stronger
or weaker than the proof actually needs, is a FATAL defect of the
missing-hypothesis class — not a quibble. Equally, the library has already
adopted AC, countable choice and dependent choice as foundational axioms, so
using one *within its declared scope* is not a defect.

## Output — the only thing you return

Plain markdown. For each finding, one block:

```
### FINDING 1, 2, 3, ... — FATAL or NONFATAL — location: title / Statement / [L#] / step X.Y / Remark
CLAIM AS WRITTEN: "<verbatim quote of the offending text>"
WHY IT FAILS: <the concrete false claim, unlicensed inference, missing
hypothesis, or inaccurate citation — with the verbatim dependency text that
does or does not license it>
WHAT WOULD FIX IT: <the smallest correction you can name, or "not obvious">
```

If, having genuinely tried to refute it, you find nothing fatal, say so plainly
and list what you checked. Finish with one line: `N fatal, M nonfatal`.

A confident empty reading is worse than useless here. Either name a concrete
defect with its quotation, or state clearly that you could not find one.

# This dispatch

# Citation-precision audit — do these citing items state their target correctly?

You are reading a **published legacy corpus** of this library. Below are one or
more TARGET items, each quoted as it actually stands on disk, followed by every
place in this audit wave that cites it.

**The one question for every citing line:** does the citing text state the
target's own proposition — same domain, same quantifiers, same hypotheses, same
direction, same strength — or does it state something the target does not
actually give? A fact that quietly drops a hypothesis, flips an implication,
promotes an implication to a biconditional, or widens a domain is a **FATAL**
defect of the incorrect-dependency-citation class. It is this library's single
most common confirmed defect, and it is only visible by reading the two texts
against each other, which is what this file lets you do.

Do NOT report: a concise but faithful shortening (that is the required house
style); a paraphrase that preserves content; wording you would have chosen
differently; missing URLs; prose style. A citing line reading as a shortened
but faithful version of the target is CORRECT and must not be flagged.

Where a citing line says a dependency is declared but never cited in the body,
say whether that looks like a stale declaration or a use that lost its citation
— that one is NONFATAL either way.

For every finding use the block format from the brief, and finish with the
`N fatal, M nonfatal` line. If every citation is faithful, say so plainly and
name the targets you checked.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `thm-r-uncountable`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/thm-r-uncountable.md` — theorem — $\\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable (Cantor's nested intervals, 1874)

#### Statement

Let $\mathbb{R}$ be a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).
Then $\mathbb{R}$ is **uncountable** ([[def-countable]]): there is no surjection
$\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, so $\mathbb{R}$ is neither finite nor countably
infinite.

The proof is Cantor's original argument of 1874, not the decimal diagonal.
Assuming a surjection $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, one builds nested closed
intervals $[a_n, b_n]$ with $a_n < b_n$ and $f(n) \notin [a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}]$, and
then $\sup\{a_n\}$ is a real number that $f$ misses. **The decimal diagonal is
deliberately avoided**: decimal expansions are infinite series, which this
library has not yet constructed, so a diagonal proof here would rest on machinery
that does not exist. The diagonal argument survives in its non-circular form, on
power sets, as Cantor's theorem earlier on this page; see the remarks below.

**The construction uses no choice, and that is what the thirds are for.** Given
$[a_n, b_n]$ of length $d$, its three closed thirds
$[a_n, a_n + d/3]$, $[a_n + d/3, a_n + 2d/3]$, $[a_n + 2d/3, b_n]$ cannot all
contain $f(n)$, because the first and the third are disjoint; the rule takes the
**first one in that fixed order** which does not contain $f(n)$. That is a
definition by cases, so the whole construction is a single application of the
recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) to one explicitly given function. A version
of the argument that says "pick a third avoiding $f(n)$" would be using dependent
choice, silently and unnecessarily.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `thm-closure-characterisation-top`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/thm-closure-characterisation-top.md` — theorem — A point lies in the closure of $A$ iff every basic neighbourhood of it meets $A$; the closure is the smallest closed superset and equals $A$ together with its derived set

#### Statement

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, let $\mathcal{B}$ be a basis for
$\mathcal{T}$ ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]), let $A \subseteq X$ and let
$x \in X$. Closure, derived set and limit points are as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]. Then:

1. The following four conditions are equivalent.
   - (a) $x \in \overline{A}$;
   - (b) $N \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every neighbourhood $N$ of $x$
     ([[def-neighbourhood-top]]);
   - (c) $U \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every open $U$ with $x \in U$;
   - (d) $B \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every $B \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B$.
2. $\overline{A}$ is closed, contains $A$, and is contained in every closed
   $F \subseteq X$ with $A \subseteq F$; so it is the smallest closed superset of
   $A$, and $A$ is closed if and only if $A = \overline{A}$.
3. $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$.

Claim 2 is recorded here for reference and is discharged in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]], where it is what makes the definition of
$\overline{A}$ well posed; claims 1 and 3 are proved below. Claim 1 is the form in
which the closure is used everywhere afterwards, and clause (d) is what makes a
closure computable from a basis rather than from all open sets.

### `cex-the-deleted-tychonoff-plank-is-not-normal` (published-backward, page separation-axioms-examples)

Title: Refuted, assuming countable choice: every Hausdorff space built from ordinal spaces is normal. The deleted Tychonoff plank $((\\omega_1 + 1) \\times (\\omega + 1)) \\setminus \\{(\\omega_1, \\omega)\\}$ is Hausdorff and not normal

- [L6] Normality: two disjoint closed sets have disjoint open supersets. Hausdorff: distinct points have disjoint open neighbourhoods. A set is closed exactly when its complement is open ([[def-normal-and-t4-spaces]], [[def-hausdorff-space]], [[def-topological-space]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]], [[thm-closure-characterisation-top]]).

### `def-frechet-urysohn-and-sequential-spaces` (published-backward, page nets-and-filters)

Title: Fréchet–Urysohn spaces and sequential spaces

- **NO WIKILINK TO THE TARGET ANYWHERE IN THE BODY** — the dependency is declared in `deps` but never cited in a fact or step. Report whether that is a stale declaration or a use that lost its citation.

### `def-separated-sets` (published-backward, page separation-axioms)

- ([[thm-closure-characterisation-top]], claim 2).
- ([[thm-closure-characterisation-top]], claim 2), so both displayed
- [[thm-closure-characterisation-top]]; hence $\overline{U} \cap V = \varnothing$,

### `ex-arens-space-is-sequential-not-frechet-urysohn` (published-backward, page nets-and-filters-examples)

Title: Arens space $S_2$ is sequential but not Fréchet–Urysohn

- [L1] Closure is characterized by meeting every neighbourhood, and convergence by eventual membership in every neighbourhood ([[thm-closure-characterisation-top]], [[def-sequence-convergence-top]]).

### `ex-the-discrete-and-indiscrete-extremes-of-the-hierarchy` (published-backward, page separation-axioms-examples)

Title: A discrete space satisfies every axiom in the chain; an indiscrete space with two points is regular, completely regular, normal, completely normal and perfectly normal, and fails $T_0$

- [L3] $\overline{A} = A$ when $A$ is closed, and $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed superset of $A$ ([[thm-closure-characterisation-top]], claim 2, [[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

### `ex-the-particular-point-topology-in-the-separation-hierarchy` (published-backward, page separation-axioms-examples)

Title: The particular-point topology is $T_0$ and not $T_1$, it is not regular once the set has at least two points, and it is not normal once the set has at least three

- - **Closures here are as large as they can be.** For $A \ne \varnothing$ with $p \notin A$ one has $\overline{A} = A$, since $A$ is already closed; but $\overline{\{p\}} = X$, because the only closed set containing $p$ is $X$ ([[thm-closure-characterisation-top]]). So the particular point is dense, and a single point can be dense in a space with any number of points at all.

### `lem-normality-via-shrinking` (published-backward, page separation-axioms)

Title: A space is normal if and only if every closed $A$ inside an open $U$ admits an open $V$ with $A \\subseteq V \\subseteq \\overline{V} \\subseteq U$

- [L1] $\overline{V}$ is the smallest closed superset of $V$: it is closed, contains $V$, and is contained in every closed set containing $V$ ([[thm-closure-characterisation-top]], claim 2, [[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

### `lem-pseudocompact-euclidean-subset-is-closed` (published-backward, page the-topology-of-euclidean-space)

Title: A space is regular if and only if every point has a neighbourhood base of closed neighbourhoods, if and only if $x \\in U$ open gives an open $V$ with $x \\in V \\subseteq \\overline{V} \\subseteq U$

- [L2] $\overline{V}$ is the smallest closed superset of $V$: it is closed, contains $V$, and is contained in every closed set containing $V$ ([[thm-closure-characterisation-top]], claim 2, [[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `lem-rat-embeds-dense`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/lem-rat-embeds-dense.md` — lemma — The rationals embed densely in the reals

#### Statement

The map $q \mapsto \hat q$ ([[def-real-numbers]]) is an embedding of ordered
fields. Every real is approximated by rationals: for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and
rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ with
$|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$. Consequently, strictly between any two
reals lies a rational.

Title: The truncated decimal approximations of $\\sqrt{2}$ form a Cauchy sequence of rationals with no rational limit

- **Given:** For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the rational $s_n = k_n/10^n$, where $k_n$ is the largest natural with $k_n^2 \le 2 \cdot 10^{2n}$, together with the properties established for it in [[fs-rationals-complete]]; and the real $\sqrt 2$ ([[thm-of-square-roots]]). Rationals are identified with their images in $\mathbb{R}$ under the embedding $q \mapsto \hat q$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), so $(s_n)$ is also a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]).
- [L2] The embedding $q \mapsto \hat q$ is an injective, order-preserving field homomorphism of $\mathbb{Q}$ into $\mathbb{R}$, so every identity and inequality between rationals holds between their images and conversely ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]], [[def-rationals]]).

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `lem-compactness-is-intrinsic`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/lem-compactness-is-intrinsic.md` — lemma — A subset of a metric space is open in the subspace metric exactly when it is the trace of an open set of the ambient space, and it is compact as a metric space in its own right exactly when every family of open subsets of the ambient space covering it, indexed or not, has finitely many members covering it

#### Statement

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]), let $A \subseteq X$ and let
$(A,d_A)$ be the metric subspace ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]). Then:

1. **Relative openness is a trace.** A set $V \subseteq A$ is open in $(A,d_A)$
   ([[def-metric-topology]]) if and only if $V = U \cap A$ for some $U$ open in
   $(X,d)$.
2. **Compactness read in the ambient space.** $A$ is a compact subset of $X$
   ([[def-metric-compactness]]), that is $(A,d_A)$ is a compact metric space, if
   and only if for every family $\mathcal{U}$ of open subsets of $X$ with
   $A \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{U}$ there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
   $U_0, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{U}$ with $A \subseteq U_0 \cup \dots \cup U_n$,
   or else $A = \emptyset$.
3. **The same in indexed form.** $A$ is a compact subset of $X$ if and only if
   for every set $I$ and every family $(U_i)_{i \in I}$ of open subsets of $X$
   with $A \subseteq \bigcup_{i \in I} U_i$ there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
   indices $i_0, \dots, i_n \in I$ with
   $A \subseteq U_{i_0} \cup \dots \cup U_{i_n}$, or else $A = \emptyset$.

Claim 3 is the form used by almost every later proof on this page, because a
cover is usually produced by a rule that attaches an open set to each point or to
each index, and a set of open sets forgets that rule. No choice principle is used
anywhere below; the one place a selection is made is over a finite index set, and
[[lem-finite-choice]] is a theorem of ZF.

### `fs-the-compact-open-topology-is-always-metrizable` (published-backward, page function-space-topologies)

Title: FALSE: the compact-open topology on $C(X,Y)$ is metrizable for every metric $X$ and $Y$

- [L3] $K \subseteq X$ is compact exactly when every family of open subsets of $X$ covering $K$ has finitely many members covering $K$, or $K = \varnothing$; and every set listed as $\{x_0,\dots,x_n\}$ is compact ([[def-metric-compactness]], [[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]]).

### `fs-the-evaluation-map-is-always-continuous` (published-backward, page function-space-topologies)

Title: FALSE: the evaluation map on $C(X,Y)$ with the compact-open topology is continuous for every metric $X$

- [L1] A compact subset of a metric space is closed in it and bounded; compactness of a subset is a property of the subspace metric alone, so a compact subset of $\mathbb{Q}$ is a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-compact-subset-is-closed-and-bounded]], [[def-metric-compactness]], [[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]], [[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]).

### `lem-compact-closed-balls-in-a-locally-compact-metric-space` (published-backward, page function-space-topologies)

Title: In a locally compact metric space every point has arbitrarily small compact closed balls, hence a neighbourhood base of compact sets

- [L3] A subset of a metric subspace is open in that subspace exactly when it is the trace on it of a set open in the ambient space ([[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]], claim 1).

### `lem-tube-lemma-for-a-compact-metric-factor` (published-backward, page function-space-topologies)

Title: Tube lemma: if $K$ is a compact subset of a metric space $X$, $Z$ is a topological space and $N$ is open in $X \\times Z$ with $K \\times \\{z_0\\} \\subseteq N$, then $K \\times W \\subseteq N$ for some open $W \\ni z_0$

- [L2] $K$ is a compact subset of $X$ exactly when for every set $I$ and every family $(U_i)_{i \in I}$ of open subsets of $X$ with $K \subseteq \bigcup_{i \in I} U_i$ there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $i_0, \dots, i_n \in I$ with $K \subseteq U_{i_0} \cup \dots \cup U_{i_n}$, or else $K = \varnothing$ ([[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]], claim 3).
- - **Why the pairs and not the open sets.** A single open $U \subseteq X$ may be the first entry of many admissible pairs, and recovering a suitable $W$ from $U$ alone would be a selection over an infinite family. Indexing the cover by the *pairs* rather than by the sets is what makes the second entries come back with the indices, and it is the same device the ambient form of compactness uses ([[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]]).
- - **The general tube lemma, for a compact factor in an arbitrary topological product, is now available in this library, on an earlier page** ([[lem-tube-lemma-for-a-compact-factor]]). The proof above is the metric special case of that general lemma, narrowed to a metric factor $X$ and written independently of it: nothing above cites the general statement, and nothing needs to, since compactness of a metric-space subset is the same notion under either reading ([[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]]).

### `thm-compact-open-equals-compact-convergence` (published-backward, page function-space-topologies)

Title: For a metric domain and a metric target the compact-open topology on $C(X,Y)$ is the topology of compact convergence

- compactness ([[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]]) returns everything that is needed.
- [L7] $\bar B(a,r)$ is closed and $B(a,r)$ is open in $(X,d_X)$; relative openness in a subspace is tracing, so a closed subset of $X$ traces to a closed subset of any metric subspace, and a closed subset of a compact metric space is compact ([[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]], [[def-metric-topology]], [[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]], [[lem-closed-subset-of-a-compact-space-is-compact]], [[def-metric-ball]], [[def-metric-compactness]]).
- [L8] $K$ compact and $(U_i)_{i \in I}$ open in $X$ with $K \subseteq \bigcup_i U_i$ give $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and indices $i_0, \dots, i_n \in I$ with $K \subseteq U_{i_0} \cup \dots \cup U_{i_n}$, unless $K = \varnothing$ ([[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]], claim 3).

### `thm-comparison-of-the-three-function-space-topologies` (published-backward, page function-space-topologies)

Title: On $C(X,Y)$ with $X$ and $Y$ metric, uniform convergence is finer than compact convergence, which is finer than pointwise convergence

- [L5] A one-point subset of a metric space is compact, the one-point metric space being compact ([[def-metric-compactness]], [[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]], [[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]).

### `thm-dini` (published-backward, page function-space-topologies)

Title: Dini's theorem: on a compact metric space a nondecreasing sequence of continuous real functions converging pointwise to a continuous limit converges uniformly

- ([[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]]).
- [L6] $X$ is a compact subset of itself, so every family $(U_i)_{i \in I}$ of open subsets of $X$ with $X = \bigcup_i U_i$ has $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and indices $i_0, \dots, i_n \in I$ with $X = U_{i_0} \cup \dots \cup U_{i_n}$, unless $X = \varnothing$ ([[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]], claim 3, [[def-metric-compactness]]).

### `thm-exponential-correspondence-is-continuous` (published-backward, page function-space-topologies)

Title: If $f : X \\times Z \\to Y$ is continuous then its transpose $F : Z \\to C(X,Y)$, $F(z)(x) = f(x,z)$, is continuous for the compact-open topology, with no hypothesis on $X$ beyond being metric

- [L6] The sets $S(K,V) = \{\, g \in C(X,Y) : g[K] \subseteq V \,\}$, for compact $K \subseteq X$ and open $V \subseteq Y$, are a subbasis for the compact-open topology on $C(X,Y)$ ([[def-compact-open-topology]], [[def-metric-compactness]], [[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]]).
