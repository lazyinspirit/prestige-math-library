# Wave 5 audit — A6 adversarial proof reading

You are a **read-only adversarial reader** (DeepSeek V4 Pro, max reasoning)
dispatched by the wave-5 audit Alpha of the prestige-math-library published-page
retro-audit (`AUDIT-WORKFLOW.md` step A6). You return **evidence, never edits**,
and you never propose to apply anything yourself. Alpha alone adjudicates.

> **NO SHELL-PERMISSION PROMPTS (owner, 2026-07-30) — binding on every current
> and future agent.** Never ask the owner to approve a command. You have no
> shell at all, so this is automatic for you; it is stated here because the rule
> binds every agent in this workflow verbatim.

**You have no tools and no filesystem.** Everything you are to read is in this
prompt: the item under review in full, and the Statement or Definition text of
every dependency it declares, quoted verbatim from disk. Do not speculate about
text you were not given — if a decision genuinely turns on something absent,
say so explicitly and name what is missing rather than assuming its content.

**Why you specifically.** The audit-side lineup is otherwise entirely Claude:
the Beta that read and retagged these items, the Alpha adjudicating them, and
the certifier reading repairs are all Claude models, and much of this legacy
corpus was Claude-authored too. **You are the only cross-family reader in the
loop.** A shared blind spot among the Claude readers will not show up as
disagreement among them; it can only show up as you finding something they did
not. Do not defer to the fact that a published item has already passed several
readings — this audit has repeatedly confirmed fatal defects in text that had.

**This is a retro-audit of ALREADY-PUBLISHED pages.** The item in front of you
was written, gated, judged and published months ago. Nothing about that history
is evidence that it is correct; it is the reason nobody has re-read it
adversarially since. Wave 3 measured 6 of its 11 confirmed fatal defects in
items the audit had left byte-identical.

## Your standard — the judges' standard

Read every proof step and every cited dependency as someone trying to REFUTE the
item. The point of this audit is to find what is actually wrong, not to confirm
the text reads well.

Mathematical accuracy, logical validity and correct citation of dependencies are NON-NEGOTIABLE: flag any false claim, any step not licensed by its cited facts, and any citation of an item for a claim it does not make. EXPLICITLY ACCEPTABLE, do not flag: minor citational quirks; logical gaps between proof steps that a competent reader closes within 30 SECONDS; other non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter. Library conventions that are NOT defects: sequences are functions on N and N CONTAINS 0, so indices start at 0; a natural number is a von Neumann natural (a set), so 1/k is written 1/iota(k) with iota the canonical natural of the field; the successor of a von Neumann natural n is sigma(n) = n union {n}, so n = {0,1,...,n-1} and sigma(n) = {0,1,...,n} has exactly n+1 elements; sigma(n) is NOT {0,...,n-1}, and an off-by-one objection that rests on reading it that way is a misreading of the library, not a defect; items cite by [L#] into a Facts and Assumptions block; a definition may discharge its own well-definedness inline or via justified_by. Also check the TITLE against what is actually proved: a title asserting more than the proof gives is a defect even when the Statement is correct. CITATION VOICE AND FIDELITY: every [F#], [A#], and [L#] fact must state the cited Definition or Statement itself, exactly when practical or in a concise version preserving its domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, conclusion, and direction.

## Triage — the standing rule, binding

- **Non-negotiable, always report:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity,
  correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort and do NOT report:** minor citational
  quirks; logical gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other
  non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter; prose style; page
  summary length; missing provenance URLs.

**Before alleging a cited dependency is too weak, quote the dependency text you
were given and show exactly what it fails to supply.** A refuter that asserts a
dependency is insufficient without quoting it is producing noise, and this
library's dominant real defect class — a citation of an item for a claim it does
not make — can only be established by that quotation.

**Read the Remarks with a numbered step's suspicion.** Measured across this
audit, Remark and Facts-block prose, not numbered steps, is where nearly every
confirmed fatal defect in this corpus has been found. A Remark that asserts how
some *other* item in the library uses this one is a frequent falsehood: you
cannot check those from here, so say so rather than passing them.

**Choice discipline matters in this wave.** Wave 5 is real analysis and general
topology: countability axioms, separation axioms, nets, filters, ultrafilters
and function spaces. Countable choice, dependent choice, the ultrafilter lemma
and full AC are genuinely different hypotheses here, and this library records
which one an argument spends. A proof that silently uses a choice principle its
Statement does not scope, or a Statement scoping a principle strictly stronger
or weaker than the proof actually needs, is a FATAL defect of the
missing-hypothesis class — not a quibble. Equally, the library has already
adopted AC, countable choice and dependent choice as foundational axioms, so
using one *within its declared scope* is not a defect.

## Output — the only thing you return

Plain markdown. For each finding, one block:

```
### FINDING 1, 2, 3, ... — FATAL or NONFATAL — location: title / Statement / [L#] / step X.Y / Remark
CLAIM AS WRITTEN: "<verbatim quote of the offending text>"
WHY IT FAILS: <the concrete false claim, unlicensed inference, missing
hypothesis, or inaccurate citation — with the verbatim dependency text that
does or does not license it>
WHAT WOULD FIX IT: <the smallest correction you can name, or "not obvious">
```

If, having genuinely tried to refute it, you find nothing fatal, say so plainly
and list what you checked. Finish with one line: `N fatal, M nonfatal`.

A confident empty reading is worse than useless here. Either name a concrete
defect with its quotation, or state clearly that you could not find one.

## Statement

Let $(X,d)$ be a compact metric space ([[def-metric-compactness]]), let
$f_k : X \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$
([[def-metric-continuity]], $\mathbb{R}$ carrying its usual metric,
[[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]), and suppose

$$f_k(x) \le f_{k+1}(x) \qquad \text{for every } k \in \mathbb{N} \text{ and every } x \in X ,$$

so that the sequence is **nondecreasing at every point**
([[def-monotone-sequence]]). Suppose further that $f_k(x) \to f(x)$ for every
$x \in X$ ([[def-real-limit]]) with the limit function $f : X \to \mathbb{R}$
**continuous**. Then $(f_k)$ converges to $f$ uniformly
([[def-topology-of-uniform-convergence]]).

**All four hypotheses are used.** Compactness of $X$, monotonicity of the
sequence, continuity of every $f_k$ and continuity of the limit $f$ each enter the
proof, and dropping any one of them makes the conclusion false; the companion
page exhibits the failure when the limit is not continuous.

**The nonincreasing form holds too**, by applying the theorem to $(-f_k)$ and
$-f$, which are continuous and nondecreasing at every point; the proof below is
written for the nondecreasing direction only, and the Statement claims that
direction.

**No choice principle is used**: the finite subcover produced below is returned
as a list of *indices* by the indexed form of compactness
([[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A compact metric space $(X,d)$, continuous functions $f_k : X \to \mathbb{R}$ with $f_k(x) \le f_{k+1}(x)$ for all $k$ and $x$, a continuous $f : X \to \mathbb{R}$ with $f_k(x) \to f(x)$ for every $x \in X$, and $\iota$ the canonical natural of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-canonical-natural]]).

[A1] $f_k(x) \le f_{k+1}(x)$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and every $x \in X$.

[A2] $f_k(x) \to f(x)$ in $\mathbb{R}$ for every $x \in X$, and $f$ and every $f_k$ are continuous.

[L1] A sequence of reals with $x_k \le x_{k+1}$ for every $k$ is nondecreasing, that is $x_j \le x_m$ whenever $j \le m$ ([[def-monotone-sequence]]).

[L2] A convergent sequence of reals is bounded, and a nondecreasing sequence bounded above converges to the supremum of its range; limits of real sequences are unique ([[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]], [[thm-monotone-convergence]], [[lem-limit-unique]], [[def-bounded-set]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L3] A supremum is an upper bound of its set ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L4] Continuity of $h : X \to \mathbb{R}$ at $a$: for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ with $|h(x) - h(a)| < \eta$ whenever $d(x,a) < \delta$ ([[def-metric-continuity]], [[thm-metric-continuity-characterisations]], [[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]], [[def-abs-value]]).

[L5] A subset of a metric space is open exactly when each of its points has a ball around it inside the subset ([[def-metric-topology]], [[def-metric-ball]], [[def-metrizable-space]]).

[L6] $X$ is a compact subset of itself, so every family $(U_i)_{i \in I}$ of open subsets of $X$ with $X = \bigcup_i U_i$ has $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and indices $i_0, \dots, i_n \in I$ with $X = U_{i_0} \cup \dots \cup U_{i_n}$, unless $X = \varnothing$ ([[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]], claim 3, [[def-metric-compactness]]).

[L7] For $n \ge 1$ and natural numbers $k_0, \dots, k_{n-1}$ there is $j^{\ast} < n$ with $k_j \le k_{j^{\ast}}$ for every $j < n$: the nonempty finite set of reals $\{\iota(k_0), \dots, \iota(k_{n-1})\}$ has a maximum, attained at some index, and $\iota$ is strictly increasing on $\mathbb{N}$, hence reflects the order ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[def-canonical-natural]]).

[L8] Uniform convergence of $(f_k)$ to $f$ is: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $N \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|f_k(x) - f(x)| < \varepsilon$ for every $x \in X$ and every $k \ge N$ ([[def-topology-of-uniform-convergence]], [[lem-uniform-convergence-in-the-uniform-metric]], [[def-metric-convergence]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Fix $x \in X$; the sequence $(f_k(x))$ is nondecreasing by [A1] and [L1], and it converges by [A2], hence is bounded and in particular bounded above. [A1, A2, L1, L2]

1.2 Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real and put $U_k := \{\, x \in X : f(x) - f_k(x) < \varepsilon \,\}$ for $k \in \mathbb{N}$. [construct]

2.1 By [L2] the sequence $(f_k(x))$ converges to the supremum of its range, and by [A2] it converges to $f(x)$, so uniqueness of limits gives $f(x) = \sup_k f_k(x)$; hence $f_k(x) \le f(x)$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and every $x \in X$. [step 1.1, A2, L2, L3]

2.2 Each $U_k$ is open: let $a \in U_k$ and put $\eta := (\varepsilon - (f(a) - f_k(a)))/2 > 0$; continuity of $f$ and of $f_k$ at $a$ gives reals $\delta_1, \delta_2 > 0$ with $|f(x)-f(a)| < \eta$ for $d(x,a) < \delta_1$ and $|f_k(x)-f_k(a)| < \eta$ for $d(x,a) < \delta_2$, and then $\delta := \min\{\delta_1,\delta_2\} > 0$ gives, for $d(x,a) < \delta$, the estimate $f(x) - f_k(x) < (f(a)+\eta) - (f_k(a)-\eta) = (f(a)-f_k(a)) + 2\eta = \varepsilon$, so $B(a,\delta) \subseteq U_k$. [step 1.2, A2, L4, L5, choose]

2.3 $X = \bigcup_{k \in \mathbb{N}} U_k$: given $x \in X$, convergence $f_k(x) \to f(x)$ supplies $k$ with $|f_k(x) - f(x)| < \varepsilon$, hence $f(x) - f_k(x) < \varepsilon$ and $x \in U_k$. [step 1.2, A2]

3.1 If $X = \varnothing$ the conclusion holds with $N := 0$, the condition being vacuous; so assume $X \ne \varnothing$, and compactness applied to the family $(U_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ gives $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $k_0, \dots, k_n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $X = U_{k_0} \cup \dots \cup U_{k_n}$. [step 2.2, step 2.3, L6, L8]

4.1 By [L7] there is $j^{\ast} \le n$ with $k_j \le k_{j^{\ast}}$ for every $j \le n$; put $N := k_{j^{\ast}}$. [step 3.1, L7]

5.1 $U_m \subseteq U_N$ whenever $m \le N$: for $x \in U_m$ we have $f_m(x) \le f_N(x)$ by [L1], so $f(x) - f_N(x) \le f(x) - f_m(x) < \varepsilon$. [step 1.2, step 4.1, A1, L1]

6.1 Hence $X = U_{k_0} \cup \dots \cup U_{k_n} \subseteq U_N$, so $X = U_N$, that is $f(x) - f_N(x) < \varepsilon$ for every $x \in X$. [step 3.1, step 4.1, step 5.1]

7.1 For every $k \ge N$ and every $x \in X$: $0 \le f(x) - f_k(x) \le f(x) - f_N(x) < \varepsilon$, using $f_k(x) \le f(x)$ from step 2.1 and $f_N(x) \le f_k(x)$ from [L1]; so $|f_k(x) - f(x)| < \varepsilon$. [step 2.1, step 6.1, A1, L1]

8.1 As $\varepsilon$ was an arbitrary positive real, step 7.1 produces for each of them an index $N$ serving every point of $X$, which is uniform convergence of $(f_k)$ to $f$. [step 1.2, step 3.1, step 7.1, L8] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where continuity of the limit is used.** Only in step 2.2, to make $U_k$ open. Without it the sets $U_k$ need not be open, the cover argument collapses, and the conclusion is false: the companion page exhibits continuous $f_k$ increasing pointwise on the compact space $[0,1]$ to a discontinuous limit, with no uniform convergence.

- **Where monotonicity is used.** Twice, and both times to turn "some index works at this point" into "one index works at every point": at step 5.1, to make the sets $U_k$ increase with $k$ so that a finite subcover collapses to a single $U_N$, and at step 7.1, to propagate the bound from $N$ to every later index.

- **Where compactness is used.** Once, at step 3.1. On a non-compact domain the theorem fails, and the standard witness is the increasing sequence of functions on $(0,1]$ that are $0$ up to $1/(k+1)$ and rise to $1$; nothing on this page needs that witness and it is not constructed here.

- **The conclusion is genuinely about the sequence and not about the family.** Dini's theorem says nothing about an arbitrary set of continuous functions with a continuous pointwise supremum; the ordering of the sequence by its index is what steps 5.1 and 7.1 consume.

dependency text and show exactly what it fails to supply.

### `def-metric-compactness` — definition — Open cover, subcover, compact metric space, and compact subset of a metric space

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]), with open sets as in
[[def-metric-topology]] and balls as in [[def-metric-ball]].

- An **open cover** of $(X,d)$ is a family $\mathcal{U}$ of open subsets of $X$
  with $X = \bigcup \mathcal{U}$, where
  $\bigcup \mathcal{U} = \{\, x \in X : x \in U \text{ for some } U \in \mathcal{U} \,\}$.
- A **subcover** of $\mathcal{U}$ is a subfamily
  $\mathcal{V} \subseteq \mathcal{U}$ that is itself an open cover.
- A family $\mathcal{V}$ of sets is **finite** when $\mathcal{V} = \emptyset$ or
  there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and sets $V_0, \dots, V_n$ with
  $\mathcal{V} = \{V_0, \dots, V_n\}$; repetitions in the list are allowed and
  harmless.
- $(X,d)$ is **compact** when every open cover of it has a finite subcover: for
  every open cover $\mathcal{U}$, either $X = \emptyset$ and the empty subfamily
  covers it, or there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
  $U_0, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{U}$ with
  $$X = U_0 \cup \dots \cup U_n .$$
- A subset $A \subseteq X$ is a **compact subset** of $X$ when the metric
  subspace $(A, d_A)$ is a compact metric space, $d_A$ being the restriction of
  $d$ to $A \times A$ ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]).

**Compactness of a subset is defined intrinsically, and only intrinsically.**
The last clause speaks about the subspace $(A,d_A)$ and its own open sets, not
about families of open subsets of the ambient $X$. The two readings do agree,
but that is a theorem and not a convention: it is
[[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]], and no item of this library may use the
ambient reading without citing it. Taking the intrinsic reading as the
definition is what makes "compact" a property of the metric space $(A,d_A)$
alone, so that a set compact in one ambient space is compact in every other one
containing it isometrically.

**The empty space is compact**, since the empty subfamily of any family covers
it; this is the reason the clause above is written with the two cases. The
one-point space is compact too, and so is every space listed as
$\{x_0, \dots, x_n\}$: given a cover, each $x_i$ lies in some member, and
finitely many members chosen in this way already cover.

**The finiteness convention, and how it is used both ways.** "Finite" above is
the listing form, matching the finite lists of
[[def-finite-intersection-property]]. It agrees with the definition of
finiteness by equinumerosity with a natural number ([[def-countable]]), and
both directions of the agreement are available and are used below:

- A nonempty finite set $F$ in the sense of [[def-countable]] satisfies
  $F \approx m$ for some $m \ge 1$, and a bijection $m \to F$ is exactly a
  listing $F = \{a_0, \dots, a_{m-1}\}$.
- Conversely a set listed as $A = \{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$, that is the image of a
  function $a$ with domain $\sigma(n)$, is finite in the sense of
  [[def-countable]]: the map sending $x \in A$ to the least $i \le n$ with
  $a_i = x$ is an injection of $A$ into $\sigma(n)$, so $A$ is equinumerous with
  a subset of $\mathbb{N}$ bounded above, and such a subset is finite
  ([[lem-subset-of-countable]]).

Neither direction uses a choice principle: the second selects nothing, taking a
least index instead.

### `lem-compactness-is-intrinsic` — lemma — A subset of a metric space is open in the subspace metric exactly when it is the trace of an open set of the ambient space, and it is compact as a metric space in its own right exactly when every family of open subsets of the ambient space covering it, indexed or not, has finitely many members covering it

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]), let $A \subseteq X$ and let
$(A,d_A)$ be the metric subspace ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]). Then:

1. **Relative openness is a trace.** A set $V \subseteq A$ is open in $(A,d_A)$
   ([[def-metric-topology]]) if and only if $V = U \cap A$ for some $U$ open in
   $(X,d)$.
2. **Compactness read in the ambient space.** $A$ is a compact subset of $X$
   ([[def-metric-compactness]]), that is $(A,d_A)$ is a compact metric space, if
   and only if for every family $\mathcal{U}$ of open subsets of $X$ with
   $A \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{U}$ there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
   $U_0, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{U}$ with $A \subseteq U_0 \cup \dots \cup U_n$,
   or else $A = \emptyset$.
3. **The same in indexed form.** $A$ is a compact subset of $X$ if and only if
   for every set $I$ and every family $(U_i)_{i \in I}$ of open subsets of $X$
   with $A \subseteq \bigcup_{i \in I} U_i$ there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
   indices $i_0, \dots, i_n \in I$ with
   $A \subseteq U_{i_0} \cup \dots \cup U_{i_n}$, or else $A = \emptyset$.

Claim 3 is the form used by almost every later proof on this page, because a
cover is usually produced by a rule that attaches an open set to each point or to
each index, and a set of open sets forgets that rule. No choice principle is used
anywhere below; the one place a selection is made is over a finite index set, and
[[lem-finite-choice]] is a theorem of ZF.

### `def-metric-continuity` — definition — Continuity of a map between metric spaces, at a point and globally, in the $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ form

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Let $(X, d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$ be metric spaces ([[def-metric-space]]), let
$f : X \to Y$ be a function and let $a \in X$.

$f$ is **continuous at $a$** if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ such that

$$d_X(x,a) < \delta \;\Longrightarrow\; d_Y\big(f(x), f(a)\big) < \varepsilon \qquad \text{for all } x \in X .$$

$f$ is **continuous** (globally, or on $X$) if it is continuous at every point of
$X$.

**The same condition in balls.** Since $d_X(x,a) < \delta$ says $x \in B_X(a,\delta)$
and $d_Y(f(x),f(a)) < \varepsilon$ says $f(x) \in B_Y(f(a),\varepsilon)$
([[def-metric-ball]]), continuity at $a$ reads: for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there
is $\delta > 0$ with

$$f\big[B_X(a,\delta)\big] \subseteq B_Y\big(f(a), \varepsilon\big).$$

Both forms are used below and are the same statement written twice.

**Both metrics matter, and both are named.** Continuity is a property of the
triple $(d_X, d_Y, f)$, not of $f$ alone. When several metrics on the same
underlying sets are in play, as in [[def-equivalent-metrics]], the metrics are
always written out.

**Quantifier order.** The $\delta$ is allowed to depend on $\varepsilon$ **and on
the point $a$**. Requiring one $\delta$ to work at every point simultaneously is
a strictly stronger condition, uniform continuity; it is defined on a later page
of this library, and at this point in the reading order it is written out in full
where needed ([[def-equivalent-metrics]]).

### `thm-metric-continuity-characterisations` — theorem — For a map of metric spaces the following agree: $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuity everywhere, preimages of open sets are open, preimages of closed sets are closed, sequential continuity, and $f(\\overline{A}) \\subseteq \\overline{f(A)}$

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ be metric spaces ([[def-metric-space]]) and let
$f : X \to Y$ be a function, with images and preimages written $f[\,\cdot\,]$
and $f^{-1}[\,\cdot\,]$ ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]). The following
five statements are equivalent.

- **(a)** $f$ is continuous at every point of $X$ in the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$
  sense ([[def-metric-continuity]]).
- **(b)** $f^{-1}[V]$ is open in $X$ for every open $V \subseteq Y$
  ([[def-metric-topology]]).
- **(c)** $f^{-1}[G]$ is closed in $X$ for every closed $G \subseteq Y$.
- **(d)** $f$ is **sequentially continuous**: whenever $x_k \to x$ in $(X,d_X)$,
  also $f(x_k) \to f(x)$ in $(Y,d_Y)$ ([[def-metric-convergence]]).
- **(e)** $f[\overline{A}] \subseteq \overline{f[A]}$ for every $A \subseteq X$
  ([[def-metric-interior-closure-boundary]]).

**Where choice is used.** Only the implication (d) $\Rightarrow$ (e) uses a
choice principle, and it uses it only through
[[thm-metric-sequential-closure]], whose forward direction spends the Axiom of
Countable Choice ([[def-countable-choice]]). The cycle
(a) $\Rightarrow$ (b) $\Rightarrow$ (c) $\Rightarrow$ (e) $\Rightarrow$ (a) and
the implication (a) $\Rightarrow$ (d) are choice free.

### `lem-uniform-convergence-in-the-uniform-metric` — lemma — Convergence in the uniform metric is exactly uniform convergence: one $N$ serving every point

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Statement

Let $X$ be a nonempty set, let $(Y,d)$ be a metric space
([[def-metric-space]]), and let $\bar\rho$ be the uniform metric on $Y^{X}$
([[lem-uniform-metric-on-a-function-space]]). Let $(f_k)$ be a sequence in
$Y^{X}$ and let $f \in Y^{X}$. Then

$$f_k \to f \text{ in } (Y^{X}, \bar\rho) \qquad \Longleftrightarrow \qquad (f_k) \text{ converges uniformly to } f ,$$

convergence in a metric space being [[def-metric-convergence]] and uniform
convergence being [[def-topology-of-uniform-convergence]].

**This is what makes the name of the topology accurate**, and it is the reason
the truncation at $1$ in the uniform metric costs nothing: below the threshold the
truncated and untruncated distances agree, and convergence is a statement about
arbitrarily small distances. No choice principle is used.

### `def-topology-of-uniform-convergence` — definition — Uniform convergence, and the topology of uniform convergence: the metric topology of the uniform metric on $Y^{X}$ and on $C(X,Y)$

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Let $X$ be a nonempty set and let $(Y,d)$ be a metric space
([[def-metric-space]]).

**Uniform convergence.** A sequence $(f_k)$ in $Y^{X}$
([[def-topology-of-pointwise-convergence]]) **converges uniformly** to
$f \in Y^{X}$ if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$
such that

$$d\big(f_k(x), f(x)\big) < \varepsilon \qquad \text{for every } x \in X \text{ and every } k \ge K .$$

The whole content is the quantifier order: one index $K$ must serve **every**
point of $X$ at once, whereas pointwise convergence allows $K$ to depend on the
point as well as on $\varepsilon$. As everywhere in this library $\mathbb{N}$
contains $0$ and a sequence is indexed from $0$
([[def-topology-of-pointwise-convergence]]).

**The topology.** The **topology of uniform convergence** (the *uniform
topology*) on $Y^{X}$ is the metric topology $\mathcal{T}_{\bar\rho}$
([[def-metric-topology]]) of the uniform metric

$$\bar\rho(f,g) = \sup_{x \in X} \min\{\, d(f(x),g(x)),\ 1 \,\}$$

of [[lem-uniform-metric-on-a-function-space]]. Its basic open sets are the balls
$B_{\bar\rho}(f,\varepsilon)$ ([[def-metric-ball]]), and $Y^{X}$ with this
topology is a metrizable space ([[def-metrizable-space]]).

**On $C(X,Y)$.** If $X$ carries a topology, the **topology of uniform
convergence on $C(X,Y)$** ([[def-continuous-map-top]]) is the subspace topology
inherited from $Y^{X}$ ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]). It is the metric topology
of the restriction of $\bar\rho$ to $C(X,Y) \times C(X,Y)$: the subspace topology
of a metric topology is the metric topology of the subspace metric
([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]], [[def-metrizable-space]]). So the two
readings of the phrase agree, and $C(X,Y)$ carrying it is again metrizable.

**The name is justified by the next item.** That convergence in
$\mathcal{T}_{\bar\rho}$ is exactly uniform convergence in the sense defined above
is not part of the definition; it is
[[lem-uniform-convergence-in-the-uniform-metric]], and it is what entitles the
topology to the name.

**$X$ is nonempty throughout.** The uniform metric is defined only for nonempty
$X$ ([[lem-uniform-metric-on-a-function-space]]), so the topology of uniform
convergence is defined only there. The notion of uniform convergence itself makes
sense for $X = \varnothing$ and is vacuous, every sequence converging uniformly
to the unique element of $Y^{\varnothing}$; nothing below uses that case.

### `thm-monotone-convergence` — theorem — A nondecreasing sequence bounded above converges to the supremum of its range, and a nonincreasing sequence bounded below to the infimum

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Statement

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]) and let
$S = \{x_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$ be its range.

1. If $(x_k)$ is nondecreasing ([[def-monotone-sequence]]) and $S$ is bounded
   above ([[def-bounded-set]]), then $(x_k)$ converges ([[def-real-limit]]) and
   $$\lim_{k} x_k = \sup S .$$
2. If $(x_k)$ is nonincreasing and $S$ is bounded below, then $(x_k)$ converges
   and $$\lim_{k} x_k = \inf S .$$

Both suprema and infima exist under the stated hypotheses: $S$ is nonempty, so
the least-upper-bound property ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) supplies the
first and [[thm-infimum-property]] the second, and each is unique
([[lem-sup-unique]]).

This is the first place in this track where the least-upper-bound property
produces a **limit**. Everything on the sequences page held in any Archimedean
ordered field; the theorem below does not, and the sequence of decimal
truncations of $\sqrt 2$ inside $\mathbb{Q}$ is the standard witness of its
failure there.

### `def-metric-convergence` — definition — Convergence of a sequence in a metric space: $x_k \\to x$ iff $d(x_k, x) \\to 0$ in $\\mathbb{R}$

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]).

A **sequence in $X$** is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to X$, written $(x_k)$ with
$x_k := x(k)$. As everywhere in this library, $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
([[def-natural-numbers]]) and a sequence is indexed from $0$
([[def-sequence]]); an index range copied from a text that starts at $1$ must be
shifted before it is used here.

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence in $X$ and $p \in X$. The function
$k \mapsto d(x_k, p)$ is a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]), and it is
nonnegative ([[lem-metric-nonnegativity]]), so $|d(x_k,p)| = d(x_k,p)$
([[def-abs-value]]). Define

$$x_k \longrightarrow p \text{ in } (X,d) \quad :\Longleftrightarrow \quad d(x_k,p) \longrightarrow 0 \text{ in } \mathbb{R},$$

the convergence on the right being that of [[def-real-limit]]. Unwound, this
says: for every **rational** $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with
$d(x_k, p) < \varepsilon$ for every $k \ge K$. We then call $p$ a **limit** of
$(x_k)$, and say $(x_k)$ **converges** in $(X,d)$ if it has a limit.

**Rational and real $\varepsilon$ agree here, as they do on the real line.**
[[def-real-limit]] tests convergence against rational $\varepsilon$ only, and its
own remark, restated for sequences in [[def-sequence]], records that nothing is
lost: below any real $\eta > 0$ lies a positive rational
([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and the index belonging to that rational serves for
$\eta$. So a proof may establish convergence by producing an index for every
real $\varepsilon > 0$, and may use a convergence hypothesis at a real
$\varepsilon$ by first passing to a rational below it. Both moves are used on
this page and are always cited.

**Subsequences and subsequential limits.** A **subsequence** of $(x_k)$ is the
composite $x \circ n$ for a strictly increasing $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$,
written $(x_{n_j})$, exactly as for sequences of reals ([[def-sequence]]); and
$p$ is a **subsequential limit** of $(x_k)$ in $(X,d)$ when some subsequence
converges to $p$, which is the metric-space form of [[def-subsequential-limit]].

### `lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space` — lemma — The absolute value makes $\\mathbb{R}$ a metric space: $d(x,y) = |x-y|$ is a metric, its open balls are the intervals $(x-r, x+r)$, and it is unbounded

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Define $d_{\mathbb{R}} : \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ by
$d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) := |x - y|$ ([[def-abs-value]]). Then:

1. $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ is a metric on $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-metric-space]]); it is
   called the **usual metric** of $\mathbb{R}$.
2. For $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and $r > 0$ the open ball is the bounded open interval
   ([[def-interval]], [[def-metric-ball]])
   $$B(x,r) = (x-r,\ x+r),$$
   and the closed ball is $\bar B(x,r) = [x-r,\ x+r]$.
3. Consequently $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is open in the metric topology of
   $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-metric-topology]]) exactly when for every $x \in U$
   there is $r > 0$ with $(x-r, x+r) \subseteq U$. This topology is called the
   **usual topology** of $\mathbb{R}$.
4. $(\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$ is not a bounded metric space
   ([[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]): no ball contains $\mathbb{R}$, so
   $\operatorname{diam}(\mathbb{R})$ is not defined.

### `def-metrizable-space` — definition — Metrizable space: a topological space whose topology is induced by some metric; metrizability is topological, the metric is not

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ ([[def-topological-space]]) is
**metrizable** if there is a metric $d$ on $X$ ([[def-metric-space]]) whose
metric topology is $\mathcal{T}$, that is $\mathcal{T} = \mathcal{T}_d$
([[def-metric-topology]]). Such a $d$ is said to **induce** or **metrise**
$\mathcal{T}$.

**The definition presupposes that $\mathcal{T}_d$ is a topology in the sense of
[[def-topological-space]], and it is.** By [[def-metric-topology]] both
$\varnothing$ and $X$ are open in $(X,d)$, which is (T1), and by
[[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]] the family $\mathcal{T}_d$ is closed under
arbitrary unions, which is (T2), and under intersections of $n \ge 1$ members,
which contains (T3). So every metric space is a topological space, and the
metric-space development of this library is a special case of the present one.

**The standard local notions in the two developments agree after translating
their neighbourhood conventions.** Let $d$ be a metric on $X$ and give $X$ the
topology $\mathcal{T}_d$.

- *Neighbourhoods and balls.* [[def-metric-topology]] uses "neighbourhood" for
  an open set containing $x$, whereas [[def-neighbourhood-top]] also allows a
  non-open superset of such a set. Thus the two collections are not literally
  equal, but the open metric neighbourhoods are cofinal in the broader
  neighbourhood filter. The balls $B(x,r)$, $r > 0$ ([[def-metric-ball]]), are
  open ([[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]]) and form a neighbourhood base at $x$:
  any neighbourhood $N$ contains an open $U \ni x$, hence a ball around $x$ by
  [[def-metric-topology]]. The balls of radius $1/n$ alone already suffice
  ([[lem-metric-ball-neighbourhood-base]]).
- *Interior, closure, boundary.* [[def-metric-interior-closure-boundary]] defines
  them by the same conditions with balls in place of neighbourhoods, and the
  previous bullet makes the two conditions equivalent; the metric closure is the
  smallest closed superset ([[thm-metric-closure-characterisation]]), which is the
  definition used here ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]). So the two
  closures, the two interiors and the two boundaries are the same three
  operations.
- *Convergence.* $x_k \to p$ in the sense of [[def-sequence-convergence-top]] is
  "eventually in every neighbourhood of $p$", and by the first bullet this is
  "eventually in every ball around $p$", which is [[def-metric-convergence]].
- *Continuity.* $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ continuity at $a$
  ([[def-metric-continuity]]) says that every ball around $f(a)$ has a ball
  around $a$ mapped into it, which by the first bullet is continuity at $a$ in
  the sense of [[def-continuous-map-top]].

- *Subspaces.* For $A \subseteq X$ the subspace topology
  $\{\, U \cap A : U \in \mathcal{T}_d \,\}$ of [[def-subspace-topology-top]] is
  exactly the metric topology of the subspace metric $d_A$
  ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]), so the two uses of the phrase
  *subspace topology* in this library name one thing. Indeed
  $B_A(a,r) = B_X(a,r) \cap A$: a trace $U \cap A$ is $d_A$-open, since each of
  its points $a$ has $B_X(a,r) \subseteq U$ and hence $B_A(a,r) \subseteq U \cap A$;
  and a $d_A$-open $W$ is the trace of
  $U := \bigcup \{\, B_X(a,r) : a \in W,\ r > 0,\ B_X(a,r) \cap A \subseteq W \,\}$,
  which is $d_X$-open, satisfies $U \cap A = W$, and involves no choice principle,
  the union being taken over a set of pairs rather than over a selection.

Consequently the metric-space notions of interior, closure, boundary, density,
convergence, continuity and subspace agree with the topological notions here,
and statements about them transfer once a metric is named. For neighbourhoods
the transfer uses the explicit convention change above: a metric-page
neighbourhood is an open topological neighbourhood, while every topological
neighbourhood contains one.

**Metrizability is a topological property; the metric is not part of it.** If
$h : X \to Y$ is a homeomorphism ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]) and $d$
metrises $X$, then $d'(y_1,y_2) := d(h^{-1}(y_1), h^{-1}(y_2))$ is a metric on
$Y$ — the three axioms transfer along the bijection $h^{-1}$ — and
$h[B_d(x,r)] = B_{d'}(h(x), r)$, so $h$ carries a basis of $\mathcal{T}_d$ to a
basis of $\mathcal{T}_{d'}$ and $\mathcal{T}_{d'} = h[\mathcal{T}_d] = \mathcal{T}_Y$.
Hence $Y$ is metrizable. The metric itself, however, is **not** determined by the
topology: two metrics on one set may induce the same topology without agreeing,
which is exactly topological equivalence ([[def-equivalent-metrics]]), and
properties of a metric that are not properties of its topology, boundedness among
them, are therefore not properties of a metrizable space.

**Two things every metrizable space has.** It is **Hausdorff**: distinct points
have disjoint open neighbourhoods, by [[thm-metric-hausdorff-separation]] applied
to any metric inducing the topology. And it is **first countable**
([[def-first-countable-top]]), by [[lem-metric-ball-neighbourhood-base]]. Either
failure is therefore an obstruction to metrizability, and this page uses the
first of them to exhibit a topology induced by no metric.

**Sequential limits in a metrizable space are unique, so the notation
$\lim_k x_k$ is available there.** In a metric space a sequence has at most one
limit ([[lem-metric-limits-unique]]), and by the agreement of convergence above
that uniqueness is a statement about the topology alone; so within a metrizable
space, and only there, this page writes $\lim_k x_k$ in the ordinary way. In a
general space the symbol is unavailable ([[def-sequence-convergence-top]]).

**The usual topology of $\mathbb{R}$.** The absolute value makes $\mathbb{R}$ a
metric space under $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) = |x-y|$, its open balls are the bounded
open intervals, and the resulting metric topology is what claim 3 of
[[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]] names the **usual topology** of $\mathbb{R}$.
That is the topology meant by the phrase throughout these two pages, and
$\mathbb{R}$ carrying it is metrizable by definition. Every statement about it on
these two pages is proved from the metric $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ and the bridge above,
and no example re-derives any of it.

### `def-bounded-set` — definition — Lower bound, bounded below, bounded set

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ denotes the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a subset of it.

The notions **upper bound** and **bounded above** are already fixed by
[[def-complete-ordered-field]] and are only recalled here, never redefined:
$u \in \mathbb{R}$ is an *upper bound* of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$, and
$S$ is *bounded above* if it has at least one upper bound. The dual notions are:

- $\ell \in \mathbb{R}$ is a **lower bound** of $S$ if $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.
- $S$ is **bounded below** if it has at least one lower bound.
- $S$ is **bounded** if it is both bounded above and bounded below, that is, if
  there are $\ell, u \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\ell \le s \le u$ for every $s \in S$.

### `def-monotone-sequence` — definition — Nondecreasing, increasing, nonincreasing, decreasing, monotone, and eventually monotone sequences

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]), with $\mathbb{R}$ ordered
as in [[def-real-order]] and [[def-complete-ordered-field]], and with
$\mathbb{N}$ ordered as in [[def-nat-order]]. The sequence is:

- **nondecreasing** when $x_j \le x_k$ for all $j \le k$;
- **increasing** (or *strictly increasing*) when $x_j < x_k$ for all $j < k$;
- **nonincreasing** when $x_j \ge x_k$ for all $j \le k$;
- **decreasing** (or *strictly decreasing*) when $x_j > x_k$ for all $j < k$;
- **monotone** when it is nondecreasing or nonincreasing;
- **strictly monotone** when it is increasing or decreasing;
- **eventually monotone** when some tail $x^{(K)}$ ([[def-sequence]]) is
  monotone, that is when there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that the restriction of
  the comparison to indices $\ge K$ is one-signed.

An increasing sequence is nondecreasing and a decreasing sequence is
nonincreasing, since $j \le k$ means $j < k$ or $j = k$ and the second case gives
equality. A sequence that is both nondecreasing and nonincreasing is constant.

**Consecutive comparisons suffice, and that is an induction.** The four
conditions above quantify over *all* pairs of indices, but what one checks in
practice, and what a recursive construction delivers, is the comparison of
consecutive terms. The two agree:

> $(x_k)$ is nondecreasing **if and only if** $x_k \le x_{\sigma(k)}$ for every
> $k \in \mathbb{N}$, and $(x_k)$ is increasing **if and only if**
> $x_k < x_{\sigma(k)}$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$; likewise, with the
> inequalities reversed, for nonincreasing and decreasing.

The forward implications are the instances $j = k$, $k = \sigma(k)$ of the
definitions, using $k < \sigma(k)$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]). For the converse,
suppose $x_i \le x_{\sigma(i)}$ for every $i$ and fix $k$; we show by induction
on $k$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]) that $x_j \le x_k$ for every $j \le k$. For
$k = 0$: $j \le 0$ forces $j = 0$, and $x_0 \le x_0$. Assume the statement for
$k$ and let $j \le \sigma(k)$. If $j = \sigma(k)$ then $x_j \le x_{\sigma(k)}$ by
reflexivity. Otherwise $j < \sigma(k)$, and then $j \le k$: were $k < j$ we would
have $k < j < \sigma(k)$, which [[lem-nat-discrete]] excludes, so $j \le k$ by
totality of the order on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]). The induction
hypothesis gives $x_j \le x_k$, and $x_k \le x_{\sigma(k)}$ by assumption, so
$x_j \le x_{\sigma(k)}$ by transitivity. This completes the induction. The three
remaining equivalences are the same argument with $\le$ replaced by $<$,
$\ge$ or $>$, transitivity of the strict order being used in the same place.

**Boundedness of a monotone sequence is one-sided.** A nondecreasing sequence is
bounded below by its first term $x_0$, and a nonincreasing sequence is bounded
above by $x_0$, both immediately from the definition with $j = 0$. So for a
nondecreasing sequence the only substantive question is whether it is bounded
above, and for a nonincreasing sequence whether it is bounded below. The range of
$(x_k)$ is the set $\{x_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$ ([[def-sequence]]), and it is
bounded above, bounded below or bounded in the sense of [[def-bounded-set]]
exactly when the sequence is.

### `lem-convergent-implies-bounded` — lemma — Every convergent sequence is bounded

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Statement

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals converging to $x \in \mathbb{R}$
([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]). Then $(x_k)$ is bounded: there is
$M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

### `lem-limit-unique` — lemma — A sequence has at most one limit

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Statement

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]) and let $x, y \in
\mathbb{R}$. If $(x_k)$ converges to $x$ and $(x_k)$ converges to $y$
([[def-real-limit]]), then $x = y$. A sequence therefore has at most one limit,
and when a limit exists it may be denoted $\lim_{k} x_k$.

### `def-metric-ball` — definition — Open ball, closed ball and sphere in a metric space

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]), let $x \in X$ and let
$r \in \mathbb{R}$ with $r > 0$ ([[def-real-order]]). Define

$$B(x,r) := \{\, y \in X : d(x,y) < r \,\}, \qquad \bar B(x,r) := \{\, y \in X : d(x,y) \le r \,\}, \qquad S(x,r) := \{\, y \in X : d(x,y) = r \,\}.$$

$B(x,r)$ is the **open ball**, $\bar B(x,r)$ the **closed ball** and $S(x,r)$ the
**sphere** of **centre** $x$ and **radius** $r$. The radius is always a strictly
positive real; a ball of radius $0$ or of negative radius is never written in
this library.

**Immediate consequences of the definitions.** For every $x \in X$ and $r > 0$:

- $x \in B(x,r)$, because $d(x,x) = 0 < r$ (axiom (M1) of [[def-metric-space]]);
  in particular open and closed balls are nonempty.
- $B(x,r) \subseteq \bar B(x,r)$ and $S(x,r) \subseteq \bar B(x,r)$, and
  $\bar B(x,r)$ is the disjoint union of $B(x,r)$ and $S(x,r)$, by trichotomy of
  the order of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]):
  each $y$ satisfies exactly one of $d(x,y) < r$, $d(x,y) = r$, $d(x,y) > r$.
- If $0 < s \le r$ then $B(x,s) \subseteq B(x,r)$ and
  $\bar B(x,s) \subseteq \bar B(x,r)$, by transitivity of the order.
- Nonnegativity of the metric ([[lem-metric-nonnegativity]]) is what forces the
  radius convention, and it forces it for the **open** ball only: if $r \le 0$
  then $B(x,r) = \{y : d(x,y) < r\}$ is empty, because $d(x,y) \ge 0 \ge r$
  for every $y$. The other two sets behave differently at $r = 0$, and the
  convention $r > 0$ excludes them for uniformity rather than for emptiness:
  $\bar B(x,0) = S(x,0) = \{x\}$, since $d(x,y) \le 0$ together with
  $d(x,y) \ge 0$ gives $d(x,y) = 0$ and hence $y = x$ by (M1). For $r < 0$ all
  three sets are empty.

**A sphere may be empty, and so the three sets are not on a par.** For $r > 0$
the open and closed balls always contain $x$, but nothing in the definition
produces a point at distance exactly $r$ from $x$. If a metric takes only the
values $0$ and $1$, as the discrete metric on the companion page does, then
$S(x,2) = \emptyset$ while $B(x,2) = \bar B(x,2)$ is the whole space. So
nonemptiness of a sphere is never available by convention: where it is used, it
is proved.

**The ambient space is part of the notation.** $B(x,r)$ depends on $(X,d)$ and
not on $x$ and $r$ alone. When more than one space or more than one metric is in
play we write $B_X(x,r)$, or $B_d(x,r)$, and likewise for $\bar B$ and $S$. This
matters as soon as subspaces appear ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]): a
ball of a subspace is the trace on it of a ball of the ambient space, and the two
are different sets.

### `def-metric-topology` — definition — The metric topology: a set is open when every one of its points has a ball around it inside the set; closed means open complement

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]).

A subset $U \subseteq X$ is **open in $(X,d)$** if for every $x \in U$ there is a
real $r > 0$ with $B(x,r) \subseteq U$ ([[def-metric-ball]]). A subset
$F \subseteq X$ is **closed in $(X,d)$** if its complement $X \setminus F$ is
open.

The collection

$$\mathcal{T}_d := \{\, U \subseteq X : U \text{ is open in } (X,d) \,\}$$

of all open subsets is the **metric topology** of $d$ on $X$. A subset of $X$
that is both open and closed is called **clopen**.

**Two sets are open for trivial reasons.** $\emptyset$ is open, because the
defining condition quantifies over no points; and $X$ is open, because
$B(x,r) \subseteq X$ for every $x$ and every $r > 0$. Consequently $X$ and
$\emptyset$ are also closed, and both are clopen.

**A neighbourhood of a point $x$** is any open set containing $x$. The condition
above therefore reads: $U$ is open exactly when every point of $U$ has a ball
around it inside $U$, and it is the balls alone that have to be tested.

**The metric, not the set, determines $\mathcal{T}_d$.** Two metrics on the same
set may have different metric topologies, and two different metrics may have the
same one; the systematic comparison is [[def-equivalent-metrics]].

### `def-max-min` — definition — Maximum and minimum of a set

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $m \in \mathbb{R}$.

- $m$ is a **maximum** (or *greatest element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $s \le m$
  for every $s \in S$.
- $m$ is a **minimum** (or *least element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $m \le s$
  for every $s \in S$.

A set has at most one maximum: if $m_1$ and $m_2$ are both maxima then
$m_1 \in S$ gives $m_1 \le m_2$ and $m_2 \in S$ gives $m_2 \le m_1$, so
$m_1 = m_2$ by antisymmetry of the order, which is immediate from the trichotomy
axiom of an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).
The same argument applies to minima, so we may write $\max S$ and $\min S$.

### `lem-finite-set-has-max` — lemma — Every nonempty finite set of reals has a maximum and a minimum

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and all $a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n \in \mathbb{R}$, the
set $\{a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ has a maximum and a minimum ([[def-max-min]]).

What is proved below is exactly the displayed statement, by induction on $n$.

The usual reading, that *every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has a
maximum and a minimum*, follows once one identifies the nonempty finite subsets
of $\mathbb{R}$ with the sets listable as $\{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$. That
identification is recorded as a stipulation in the Given below, because this page
has no definition of finiteness to prove it against. **It is discharged, not
merely assumed**: [[lem-finite-subsets-listable]] proves that the two
descriptions of a nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ agree. That lemma is
recorded in `justified_by` rather than in `deps`, since it is about the sets this
lemma quantifies over and therefore depends on this one. This is what licenses
the notation
$\max\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ and $\min\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ for finite sets of
**real** numbers from this page onwards.

### `def-canonical-natural` — definition — The canonical natural $\\iota(n) = n \\cdot 1_F$ of a field

### Definition

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]) with additive identity $0_F$ and
multiplicative identity $1_F$. Define
$\iota : \mathbb{N} \to F$ by recursion on $\mathbb{N}$
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[thm-recursion]]):

$$\iota(0) \;:=\; 0_F, \qquad \iota(n+1) \;:=\; \iota(n) + 1_F .$$

$\iota(n)$ is the **canonical natural** of $n$ in $F$. It is also written
$n \cdot 1_F$, and for $n \ge 1$ it is $1_F$ added to itself $n$ times.

**Why the notation is needed at all.** A natural number in this library is a von
Neumann natural, that is a set ([[def-natural-numbers]]), and a set is not an
element of $F$. So $1/n$, $n^{\alpha}$ and $x/n$ are not expressions of $F$ when
$n$ is a natural: what they mean is $1/\iota(n)$, $\iota(n)^{\alpha}$ and
$x/\iota(n)$. The map $\iota$ is what carries a counting number into the field,
and writing it is the whole reason a reader meets $1/\iota(k+1)$ where an
informal text would write $1/(k+1)$.

### `lem-of-naturals-positive` — lemma — Canonical naturals are positive and strictly increasing

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field, with field structure as in [[def-field]], and for
$n \ge 1$ let $n \cdot 1_F$ denote the canonical natural number
$\underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$, defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$
and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$. Then for every $n \ge 1$:

- $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$;
- the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$;
- $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ and $(mn) \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F)$ for all $m, n \ge 1$.

### `def-abs-value` — definition — Absolute value in an ordered field

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]). The **absolute value** of
$x \in F$ is

$$|x| \;:=\; \begin{cases} x & \text{if } x \ge 0, \\ -x & \text{if } x < 0. \end{cases}$$

### `def-real-limit` — definition — Limits and Cauchy sequences of reals

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals **converges** to $x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for
every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with
$|x_k - x| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$. It is **Cauchy** when for
every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with
$|x_k - x_l| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$.

### `def-metric-space` — definition — Metric space: $d(x,y) = 0$ iff $x = y$, symmetry, and the triangle inequality; pseudometric and ultrametric

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) constructed in this
library ([[def-real-numbers]]) and carrying its order ([[def-real-order]]).

Let $X$ be a set. A **metric** on $X$ is a function
$d : X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $x, y, z \in X$:

- **(M1) Separation.** $d(x,y) = 0$ if and only if $x = y$.
- **(M2) Symmetry.** $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$.
- **(M3) Triangle inequality.** $d(x,z) \le d(x,y) + d(y,z)$.

A **metric space** is a pair $(X,d)$ consisting of a set $X$ and a metric $d$ on
it. The elements of $X$ are its **points** and $d(x,y)$ is the **distance** from
$x$ to $y$. When only one metric is in play we write $X$ for $(X,d)$; when
several are, the metric is always named.

**The values of a metric are real numbers.** The codomain is $\mathbb{R}$, so
$d(x,y)$ is an honest element of the complete ordered field and every
inequality above is an inequality there. No infinite value is permitted;
[[rem-metric-axiom-conventions]] records why extended metrics are not treated in
this library.

**Nonnegativity is deliberately absent from the axiom list.** Many texts add a
fourth axiom $d(x,y) \ge 0$. It is redundant: (M1), (M2) and (M3) already force
it, as [[lem-metric-nonnegativity]] proves. Nothing below assumes it before that
lemma is available.

**Pseudometric.** A **pseudometric** on $X$ is a function
$p : X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying (M2), (M3) and the weakening

- **(M1') Reflexivity.** $p(x,x) = 0$ for every $x \in X$

of (M1). A pseudometric may therefore assign distance $0$ to two distinct
points. Every metric is a pseudometric, and a pseudometric is a metric exactly
when $p(x,y) = 0$ forces $x = y$.

**Ultrametric.** An **ultrametric** on $X$ is a metric $d$ that in addition
satisfies

- **(M3') Strong triangle inequality.** $d(x,z) \le \max\{d(x,y), d(y,z)\}$

for all $x, y, z \in X$, where the maximum is that of a two-element subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, which exists and is one of the two elements
([[def-max-min]], [[lem-finite-set-has-max]]). An **ultrametric space** is a pair
$(X,d)$ with $d$ an ultrametric.

### `def-complete-ordered-field` — definition — Complete ordered field (least-upper-bound property)

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq F$.

- $u \in F$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$; $S$ is
  **bounded above** if it has an upper bound.
- $u \in F$ is a **least upper bound** (or **supremum**, $\sup S$) of $S$ if $u$
  is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le u'$ for every upper bound $u'$ of $S$.

$F$ is a **complete ordered field** (equivalently, $F$ has the
**least-upper-bound property**, or is **Dedekind complete**) if every nonempty
$S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$.

### `lem-sup-unique` — lemma — Suprema and infima are unique

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Statement

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. If $u_1$ and $u_2$ are both least upper bounds of
$S$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), then $u_1 = u_2$. If $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$
are both greatest lower bounds of $S$ ([[def-infimum]]), then
$\ell_1 = \ell_2$.

Consequently a set has at most one supremum and at most one infimum, and the
notations $\sup S$ and $\inf S$ denote single, well-determined real numbers
whenever they exist.
