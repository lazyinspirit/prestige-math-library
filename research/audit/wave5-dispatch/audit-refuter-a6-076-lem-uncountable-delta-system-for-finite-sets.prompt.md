# Wave 5 audit — A6 adversarial proof reading

You are a **read-only adversarial reader** (DeepSeek V4 Pro, max reasoning)
dispatched by the wave-5 audit Alpha of the prestige-math-library published-page
retro-audit (`AUDIT-WORKFLOW.md` step A6). You return **evidence, never edits**,
and you never propose to apply anything yourself. Alpha alone adjudicates.

> **NO SHELL-PERMISSION PROMPTS (owner, 2026-07-30) — binding on every current
> and future agent.** Never ask the owner to approve a command. You have no
> shell at all, so this is automatic for you; it is stated here because the rule
> binds every agent in this workflow verbatim.

**You have no tools and no filesystem.** Everything you are to read is in this
prompt: the item under review in full, and the Statement or Definition text of
every dependency it declares, quoted verbatim from disk. Do not speculate about
text you were not given — if a decision genuinely turns on something absent,
say so explicitly and name what is missing rather than assuming its content.

**Why you specifically.** The audit-side lineup is otherwise entirely Claude:
the Beta that read and retagged these items, the Alpha adjudicating them, and
the certifier reading repairs are all Claude models, and much of this legacy
corpus was Claude-authored too. **You are the only cross-family reader in the
loop.** A shared blind spot among the Claude readers will not show up as
disagreement among them; it can only show up as you finding something they did
not. Do not defer to the fact that a published item has already passed several
readings — this audit has repeatedly confirmed fatal defects in text that had.

**This is a retro-audit of ALREADY-PUBLISHED pages.** The item in front of you
was written, gated, judged and published months ago. Nothing about that history
is evidence that it is correct; it is the reason nobody has re-read it
adversarially since. Wave 3 measured 6 of its 11 confirmed fatal defects in
items the audit had left byte-identical.

## Your standard — the judges' standard

Read every proof step and every cited dependency as someone trying to REFUTE the
item. The point of this audit is to find what is actually wrong, not to confirm
the text reads well.

Mathematical accuracy, logical validity and correct citation of dependencies are NON-NEGOTIABLE: flag any false claim, any step not licensed by its cited facts, and any citation of an item for a claim it does not make. EXPLICITLY ACCEPTABLE, do not flag: minor citational quirks; logical gaps between proof steps that a competent reader closes within 30 SECONDS; other non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter. Library conventions that are NOT defects: sequences are functions on N and N CONTAINS 0, so indices start at 0; a natural number is a von Neumann natural (a set), so 1/k is written 1/iota(k) with iota the canonical natural of the field; the successor of a von Neumann natural n is sigma(n) = n union {n}, so n = {0,1,...,n-1} and sigma(n) = {0,1,...,n} has exactly n+1 elements; sigma(n) is NOT {0,...,n-1}, and an off-by-one objection that rests on reading it that way is a misreading of the library, not a defect; items cite by [L#] into a Facts and Assumptions block; a definition may discharge its own well-definedness inline or via justified_by. Also check the TITLE against what is actually proved: a title asserting more than the proof gives is a defect even when the Statement is correct. CITATION VOICE AND FIDELITY: every [F#], [A#], and [L#] fact must state the cited Definition or Statement itself, exactly when practical or in a concise version preserving its domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, conclusion, and direction.

## Triage — the standing rule, binding

- **Non-negotiable, always report:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity,
  correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort and do NOT report:** minor citational
  quirks; logical gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other
  non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter; prose style; page
  summary length; missing provenance URLs.

**Before alleging a cited dependency is too weak, quote the dependency text you
were given and show exactly what it fails to supply.** A refuter that asserts a
dependency is insufficient without quoting it is producing noise, and this
library's dominant real defect class — a citation of an item for a claim it does
not make — can only be established by that quotation.

**Read the Remarks with a numbered step's suspicion.** Measured across this
audit, Remark and Facts-block prose, not numbered steps, is where nearly every
confirmed fatal defect in this corpus has been found. A Remark that asserts how
some *other* item in the library uses this one is a frequent falsehood: you
cannot check those from here, so say so rather than passing them.

**Choice discipline matters in this wave.** Wave 5 is real analysis and general
topology: countability axioms, separation axioms, nets, filters, ultrafilters
and function spaces. Countable choice, dependent choice, the ultrafilter lemma
and full AC are genuinely different hypotheses here, and this library records
which one an argument spends. A proof that silently uses a choice principle its
Statement does not scope, or a Statement scoping a principle strictly stronger
or weaker than the proof actually needs, is a FATAL defect of the
missing-hypothesis class — not a quibble. Equally, the library has already
adopted AC, countable choice and dependent choice as foundational axioms, so
using one *within its declared scope* is not a defect.

## Output — the only thing you return

Plain markdown. For each finding, one block:

```
### FINDING 1, 2, 3, ... — FATAL or NONFATAL — location: title / Statement / [L#] / step X.Y / Remark
CLAIM AS WRITTEN: "<verbatim quote of the offending text>"
WHY IT FAILS: <the concrete false claim, unlicensed inference, missing
hypothesis, or inaccurate citation — with the verbatim dependency text that
does or does not license it>
WHAT WOULD FIX IT: <the smallest correction you can name, or "not obvious">
```

If, having genuinely tried to refute it, you find nothing fatal, say so plainly
and list what you checked. Finish with one line: `N fatal, M nonfatal`.

A confident empty reading is worse than useless here. Either name a concrete
defect with its quotation, or state clearly that you could not find one.

## Statement
Assuming choice, every uncountable family of finite sets has an uncountable subfamily forming a $\Delta$-system.
## Facts & Assumptions
**Given:** An uncountable family of finite sets.

[A1] The Axiom of Choice implies countable choice and Zorn's lemma ([[def-axiom-of-choice]], [[def-countable-choice]], [[thm-zorn]]).

[L1] Under countable choice, a countable union of at most countable sets is at most countable ([[thm-countable-union-of-countable]], [[def-countable]]).
## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Partition the family $\mathcal F$ by finite cardinality. Some layer $\mathcal F_n=\{A\in\mathcal F:|A|=n\}$ is uncountable; otherwise [L1] would make their countable union $\mathcal F$ countable. It therefore suffices to prove the assertion by induction on the common size $n$. [A1, L1]

1.2 The case $n=0$ is vacuous, since there is only one empty set. [base]

1.3 Suppose the result holds for $(n-1)$-element sets and $\mathcal F_n$ is uncountable. If some point $x$ belongs to uncountably many members, apply the induction hypothesis to $$\{A\setminus\{x\}:A\in\mathcal F_n,\ x\in A\}.$$ An uncountable $\Delta$-subfamily with root $R$ then restores to one with root $R\cup\{x\}$. [ih]

1.4 It remains to suppose that $\mathcal F_n(x)=\{A\in\mathcal F_n:x\in A\}$ is at most countable for every $x$. Order the pairwise-disjoint subfamilies of $\mathcal F_n$ by inclusion. The union of a chain is again pairwise disjoint, so Zorn's lemma in [A1] gives a maximal such family $\mathcal G$. [A1, construct]

2.1 If $\mathcal G$ were at most countable, then $M=\bigcup\mathcal G$ would be at most countable by [L1], because its members are finite. Maximality says every $A\in\mathcal F_n$ meets $M$, so $$\mathcal F_n=\bigcup_{x\in M}\mathcal F_n(x).$$ The right side is a countable union of at most countable families and is at most countable by [L1], a contradiction. Hence $\mathcal G$ is uncountable. [L1, step 1.4]

3.1 The family $\mathcal G$ is pairwise disjoint, hence is an uncountable $\Delta$-system with empty root. Together with step 1.3 this completes the induction and proves the lemma. [step 1.2, step 1.3, step 2.1, discharge-induction] ∎

## The dependencies it declares, quoted verbatim from disk

Each block below is the claim-bearing text of one declared dependency.
These are the only statements the item is entitled to use. If a step
needs more than the text below gives, that is the defect — quote the
dependency text and show exactly what it fails to supply.

### `def-countable` — definition — Finite, countably infinite, countable, uncountable

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Recall that a natural number is a von Neumann natural
([[def-natural-numbers]]): $0 = \varnothing$ and $\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$, so
that

$$n = \{\, m \in \mathbb{N} : m < n \,\} = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$$

is itself the set of its predecessors. Here $<$ is the order of
[[def-nat-order]], which is defined additively, so the displayed identity is a
theorem and not a convention: it is [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]], proved
immediately above. Let $A$ be a set, and let $\approx$ be equinumerosity
([[def-equinumerous]]).

- $A$ is **finite** if $A \approx n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
- $A$ is **countably infinite** if $A \approx \mathbb{N}$.
- $A$ is **at most countable** if it is finite or countably infinite.
- $A$ is **uncountable** if it is not at most countable.

### `def-axiom-of-choice` — definition — The Axiom of Choice

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

The **Axiom of Choice** (AC) is the following statement.

> Every family of nonempty sets has a choice function
> ([[def-choice-function]]).

Written out: for every set $\mathcal{F}$ all of whose members are nonempty,
there exists a function $g$ with domain $\mathcal{F}$ satisfying $g(S) \in S$ for
all $S \in \mathcal{F}$.

An equivalent formulation, immediate from the definition of the Cartesian
product, is that a product of nonempty sets is nonempty: if $X_i \ne \emptyset$
for every $i \in I$, then $\prod_{i \in I} X_i \ne \emptyset$.

### `def-countable-choice` — definition — The Axiom of Countable Choice ($\\mathrm{AC}_\\omega$)

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

The **Axiom of Countable Choice**, written $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$, is the following
statement.

> For every family $(X_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of nonempty sets indexed by
> $\mathbb{N}$ there is a function $f$ with domain $\mathbb{N}$ such that
> $f(n) \in X_n$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

Equivalently, in the vocabulary of [[def-choice-function]]: every at most
countable family of nonempty sets ([[def-countable]]) has a choice function.

### `thm-countable-union-of-countable` — theorem — Countable unions of at most countable sets, assuming $\\mathrm{AC}_\\omega$

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

**Assume the Axiom of Countable Choice** ([[def-countable-choice]]). Let
$(A_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a family of at most countable sets
([[def-countable]]) indexed by $\mathbb{N}$. Then

$$U = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n$$

is at most countable.

**The hypothesis $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ is not decoration and it is not removable.**
It is spent at exactly one step, step 3.1 below, where one surjection
$\mathbb{N} \to A_n$ is selected for every $n$ at once. Each $A_n$ has such
surjections, in general many of them, and the countability assumption provides no
rule for singling one out. Without some choice principle the theorem is not
available at all: ZF alone does not prove it, **conditionally on the consistency
of ZF**, as recorded among this page's false statements and discussed in the
remarks below, where that item is named and linked. The
consistency hypothesis is not a formality and cannot be dropped: the separation
rests on an external independence result that this library quotes rather than
proves, and it cannot be stated without it.

### `thm-zorn` — theorem — Zorn's lemma

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Statement

Assume the Axiom of Choice ([[def-axiom-of-choice]]). Let $(P, \le)$ be a
nonempty poset in which **every chain has an upper bound**. Then $P$ has a
maximal element ([[def-maximal-element]]).

Note the hypothesis asks only for an upper bound, not a least upper bound, and
the conclusion asserts only that a maximal element exists, never that a greatest
one does.

## What to return

Read `lem-uncountable-delta-system-for-finite-sets` adversarially against the dependency text above and return
