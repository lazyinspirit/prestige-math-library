# Wave 5 audit — A6 adversarial proof reading

You are a **read-only adversarial reader** (DeepSeek V4 Pro, max reasoning)
dispatched by the wave-5 audit Alpha of the prestige-math-library published-page
retro-audit (`AUDIT-WORKFLOW.md` step A6). You return **evidence, never edits**,
and you never propose to apply anything yourself. Alpha alone adjudicates.

> **NO SHELL-PERMISSION PROMPTS (owner, 2026-07-30) — binding on every current
> and future agent.** Never ask the owner to approve a command. You have no
> shell at all, so this is automatic for you; it is stated here because the rule
> binds every agent in this workflow verbatim.

**You have no tools and no filesystem.** Everything you are to read is in this
prompt: the item under review in full, and the Statement or Definition text of
every dependency it declares, quoted verbatim from disk. Do not speculate about
text you were not given — if a decision genuinely turns on something absent,
say so explicitly and name what is missing rather than assuming its content.

**Why you specifically.** The audit-side lineup is otherwise entirely Claude:
the Beta that read and retagged these items, the Alpha adjudicating them, and
the certifier reading repairs are all Claude models, and much of this legacy
corpus was Claude-authored too. **You are the only cross-family reader in the
loop.** A shared blind spot among the Claude readers will not show up as
disagreement among them; it can only show up as you finding something they did
not. Do not defer to the fact that a published item has already passed several
readings — this audit has repeatedly confirmed fatal defects in text that had.

**This is a retro-audit of ALREADY-PUBLISHED pages.** The item in front of you
was written, gated, judged and published months ago. Nothing about that history
is evidence that it is correct; it is the reason nobody has re-read it
adversarially since. Wave 3 measured 6 of its 11 confirmed fatal defects in
items the audit had left byte-identical.

## Your standard — the judges' standard

Read every proof step and every cited dependency as someone trying to REFUTE the
item. The point of this audit is to find what is actually wrong, not to confirm
the text reads well.

Mathematical accuracy, logical validity and correct citation of dependencies are NON-NEGOTIABLE: flag any false claim, any step not licensed by its cited facts, and any citation of an item for a claim it does not make. EXPLICITLY ACCEPTABLE, do not flag: minor citational quirks; logical gaps between proof steps that a competent reader closes within 30 SECONDS; other non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter. Library conventions that are NOT defects: sequences are functions on N and N CONTAINS 0, so indices start at 0; a natural number is a von Neumann natural (a set), so 1/k is written 1/iota(k) with iota the canonical natural of the field; the successor of a von Neumann natural n is sigma(n) = n union {n}, so n = {0,1,...,n-1} and sigma(n) = {0,1,...,n} has exactly n+1 elements; sigma(n) is NOT {0,...,n-1}, and an off-by-one objection that rests on reading it that way is a misreading of the library, not a defect; items cite by [L#] into a Facts and Assumptions block; a definition may discharge its own well-definedness inline or via justified_by. Also check the TITLE against what is actually proved: a title asserting more than the proof gives is a defect even when the Statement is correct. CITATION VOICE AND FIDELITY: every [F#], [A#], and [L#] fact must state the cited Definition or Statement itself, exactly when practical or in a concise version preserving its domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, conclusion, and direction.

## Triage — the standing rule, binding

- **Non-negotiable, always report:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity,
  correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort and do NOT report:** minor citational
  quirks; logical gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other
  non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter; prose style; page
  summary length; missing provenance URLs.

**Before alleging a cited dependency is too weak, quote the dependency text you
were given and show exactly what it fails to supply.** A refuter that asserts a
dependency is insufficient without quoting it is producing noise, and this
library's dominant real defect class — a citation of an item for a claim it does
not make — can only be established by that quotation.

**Read the Remarks with a numbered step's suspicion.** Measured across this
audit, Remark and Facts-block prose, not numbered steps, is where nearly every
confirmed fatal defect in this corpus has been found. A Remark that asserts how
some *other* item in the library uses this one is a frequent falsehood: you
cannot check those from here, so say so rather than passing them.

**Choice discipline matters in this wave.** Wave 5 is real analysis and general
topology: countability axioms, separation axioms, nets, filters, ultrafilters
and function spaces. Countable choice, dependent choice, the ultrafilter lemma
and full AC are genuinely different hypotheses here, and this library records
which one an argument spends. A proof that silently uses a choice principle its
Statement does not scope, or a Statement scoping a principle strictly stronger
or weaker than the proof actually needs, is a FATAL defect of the
missing-hypothesis class — not a quibble. Equally, the library has already
adopted AC, countable choice and dependent choice as foundational axioms, so
using one *within its declared scope* is not a defect.

## Output — the only thing you return

Plain markdown. For each finding, one block:

```
### FINDING 1, 2, 3, ... — FATAL or NONFATAL — location: title / Statement / [L#] / step X.Y / Remark
CLAIM AS WRITTEN: "<verbatim quote of the offending text>"
WHY IT FAILS: <the concrete false claim, unlicensed inference, missing
hypothesis, or inaccurate citation — with the verbatim dependency text that
does or does not license it>
WHAT WOULD FIX IT: <the smallest correction you can name, or "not obvious">
```

If, having genuinely tried to refute it, you find nothing fatal, say so plainly
and list what you checked. Finish with one line: `N fatal, M nonfatal`.

A confident empty reading is worse than useless here. Either name a concrete
defect with its quotation, or state clearly that you could not find one.

## Statement
Assuming choice, $|I|>2^{\aleph_0}$ implies $2^I$ is not separable.
## Facts & Assumptions
**Given:** Choice, $|I|>2^{\aleph_0}$, and the product topology on $2^I$.

[L1] Every nonempty at most countable set is a surjective image of $\mathbb N$ ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]]).

[L2] The binary sequences have cardinality $2^{\aleph_0}$ ([[def-cardinal-arithmetic]], [[thm-cardinal-power-set-and-cantor]]).

[F1] A condition on finitely many coordinates defines a basic open cylinder ([[def-product-topology]]).
## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose $D\subseteq2^I$ is at most countable and dense. It is nonempty because $2^I$ is nonempty, so choose a surjection $s:\mathbb N\to D$ by [L1]. For each $i\in I$ define its column $c_i\in2^{\mathbb N}$ by $c_i(n)=s(n)(i)$. [L1, assume-contra, construct]

2.1 By [L2] there are only $2^{\aleph_0}$ possible columns, whereas $|I|>2^{\aleph_0}$. Thus distinct $i,j\in I$ have $c_i=c_j$, which says $d(i)=d(j)$ for every $d\in D$ because $s$ is onto. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 The cylinder $$\{x\in2^I:x(i)=0,\ x(j)=1\}$$ is nonempty and open by [F1], but step 2.1 makes it disjoint from $D$, contradicting density. Hence $2^I$ is not separable. [step 2.1, F1, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## The dependencies it declares, quoted verbatim from disk

Each block below is the claim-bearing text of one declared dependency.
These are the only statements the item is entitled to use. If a step
needs more than the text below gives, that is the defect — quote the
dependency text and show exactly what it fails to supply.

### `def-product-topology` — definition — The product set $\\prod_{i \\in I} X_i$ of functions choosing a point in each factor, the projections, the box topology, and the product topology as the initial topology of the projections; the empty product is a one-point space

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

**The product set.** Let $I$ be a set and let $X_i$ be a set for each $i \in I$.
The **product** is

$$\prod_{i \in I} X_i \;:=\; \Big\{\, x : x \text{ is a function with domain } I \text{ and } x(i) \in X_i \text{ for every } i \in I \,\Big\},$$

and we write $x_i := x(i)$, the $i$-th **coordinate** of $x$. Two elements of the
product are equal exactly when they agree at every index, functions being equal
when they have the same domain and the same values. For $j \in I$ the $j$-th
**projection** is

$$\pi_j : \prod_{i \in I} X_i \to X_j, \qquad \pi_j(x) := x_j .$$

**Notation for a finite product.** For $I = n$ a natural number, which is the set
$\{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ of its predecessors, an element of $\prod_{k<n} X_k$ is a
function on $n$ and we write it $(x_0, \dots, x_{n-1})$. In particular $I = 2$
gives the **binary product**, written $X \times Y$ for $\prod_{i<2} X_i$ with
$X_0 = X$ and $X_1 = Y$, whose elements are written $(u,v)$ for the function
$0 \mapsto u$, $1 \mapsto v$. This is the only meaning the symbol $X \times Y$
carries on this page.

**Two facts about when the product is nonempty, stated because they are used and
because they cost something.** If some $X_{i_0}$ is empty then the product is
empty, since no function can take a value in $X_{i_0}$. Conversely, suppose every
$X_i$ is nonempty.

- For $I = n$ a natural number, the product is nonempty, and this is a theorem of
  ZF: [[lem-finite-choice]] applied to the function $i \mapsto X_i$ on $n$
  supplies a choice function $g$ for the family of values, and
  $x(i) := g(X_i)$ defines a member of $\prod_{k<n} X_k$.
- For an arbitrary $I$ the assertion "$\prod_{i \in I} X_i \ne \varnothing$
  whenever every $X_i$ is nonempty" **is** the Axiom of Choice: it is the
  formulation recorded in [[def-axiom-of-choice]], and the choice function of
  [[def-choice-function]] is exactly a point of the product of a family by
  itself. Every use of it below is flagged at the step that spends it.

**The box topology.** Now let each $X_i$ carry a topology $\mathcal{T}_i$
([[def-topological-space]]). Put

$$\mathcal{R} \;:=\; \Big\{\, \prod_{i \in I} U_i \;:\; U_i \in \mathcal{T}_i \text{ for every } i \in I \,\Big\},$$

the family of **boxes**. $\mathcal{R}$ is a basis for a topology
([[thm-basis-criterion]]): it contains $\prod_i X_i$, so it covers the product,
and it is closed under binary intersections, since

$$\Big(\prod_i U_i\Big) \cap \Big(\prod_i V_i\Big) = \prod_i (U_i \cap V_i)$$

and each $U_i \cap V_i$ is open by (T3). The topology it generates is the **box
topology** $\mathcal{T}^{\square}$, and $\mathcal{R}$ is a basis for it
([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]).

**The product topology.** The **product topology** $\mathcal{T}^{\Pi}$ on
$\prod_i X_i$ is the initial topology of the family of projections
$(\pi_i)_{i \in I}$ ([[def-initial-and-final-topology]]): the topology generated
by the subbasis

$$\mathcal{G} \;:=\; \{\, \pi_i^{-1}[U] : i \in I,\ U \in \mathcal{T}_i \,\}, \qquad \pi_i^{-1}[U] = \prod_{j \in I} W_j \ \text{ with } W_i = U \text{ and } W_j = X_j \text{ for } j \ne i .$$

By [[thm-basis-criterion]] the finite intersections of members of $\mathcal{G}$
form a basis for $\mathcal{T}^{\Pi}$, and those finite intersections are exactly
the boxes with all but finitely many factors unrestricted:

$$\mathcal{R}^{\Pi} \;=\; \Big\{\, \prod_{i \in I} U_i \;:\; U_i \in \mathcal{T}_i \text{ for every } i, \text{ and } U_i = X_i \text{ for all but finitely many } i \,\Big\}.$$

Indeed the intersection of $\pi_{i_1}^{-1}[U_1], \dots, \pi_{i_n}^{-1}[U_n]$ is
the box whose factor at $i$ is the intersection of those $U_m$ with $i_m = i$ and
is $X_i$ when no $i_m$ equals $i$; and the intersection of no members is the
whole product, the box with every factor $X_i$. Conversely a box with
$U_i = X_i$ off a finite set is such an intersection. Members of
$\mathcal{R}^{\Pi}$ are called **basic product-open** sets, and members of
$\mathcal{R}$ **boxes**. So $\mathcal{R}^{\Pi} \subseteq \mathcal{R}$, with
equality when $I$ is a natural number.

**The empty product.** For $I = \varnothing$ there is exactly one function with
domain $\varnothing$, the empty function, so $\prod_{i \in \varnothing} X_i$ is a
one-point set. A one-point set carries exactly one topology, namely
$\{\varnothing, \{\varnothing\}\}$, since a topology must contain the empty set
and the whole set and there is nothing else to contain
([[def-topological-space]]); so the box topology and the product topology agree
there, and both equal the discrete topology and the indiscrete topology
([[def-standard-topologies]]), which coincide on a one-point set. There are no
projections to speak of, and the initial topology of the empty family is indeed
the indiscrete one ([[def-initial-and-final-topology]]).

**Convention.** Unless the box topology is named explicitly, $\prod_i X_i$ always
carries the product topology in this library. That is not a matter of taste: the
product topology is the one with the characteristic property of the next item,
and the box topology has no such property.

### `def-separable-space` — definition — Separability: the existence of an at most countable dense subset

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

A topological space $X$ is **separable** if some at most countable subset $D\subseteq X$ is dense in $X$ ([[def-dense-top]], [[def-countable]]). Equivalently, every nonempty open subset of $X$ meets $D$.

### `def-cardinal-arithmetic` — definition — Cardinal sum $\\kappa \\oplus \\lambda$, product $\\kappa \\otimes \\lambda$ and exponentiation $\\kappa^{\\lambda}$, and why they are written apart from the ordinal operations

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $\kappa$ and $\lambda$ be cardinals ([[def-cardinal]]), and recall the
notation of [[lem-cardinal-operations-are-well-defined]]:

$$\kappa \sqcup \lambda = (\{0\} \times \kappa) \cup (\{1\} \times \lambda), \qquad {}^{\lambda}\kappa = \{\, h : h \text{ is a function } \lambda \to \kappa \,\}.$$

**Sum and product.**

$$\kappa \oplus \lambda \;:=\; \lvert \kappa \sqcup \lambda \rvert, \qquad \kappa \otimes \lambda \;:=\; \lvert \kappa \times \lambda \rvert .$$

Both values exist in ZF and are cardinals: claim (c) of
[[lem-cardinal-operations-are-well-defined]] well-orders each of the two sets
explicitly, and [[lem-cardinality-of-a-well-orderable-set]] then supplies the
least equinumerous ordinal. **No choice principle is used.**

**Exponentiation.**

$$\kappa^{\lambda} \;:=\; \lvert {}^{\lambda}\kappa \rvert ,$$

the number of functions from a set of size $\lambda$ to a set of size $\kappa$.
The right-hand side is defined exactly when ${}^{\lambda}\kappa$ is
well-orderable. **Assuming the Axiom of Choice** ([[def-axiom-of-choice]]) every
set is well-orderable ([[thm-well-ordering-theorem]]) and $\kappa^{\lambda}$ is
defined for all cardinals; every statement on this page that writes
$\kappa^{\lambda}$ for an infinite exponent says so in its own hypotheses.

**Transport to arbitrary sets.** If $A$ and $B$ are well-orderable with
$\lvert A \rvert = \kappa$ and $\lvert B \rvert = \lambda$, then

$$\lvert A \sqcup B \rvert = \kappa \oplus \lambda, \qquad \lvert A \times B \rvert = \kappa \otimes \lambda, \qquad \lvert {}^{B}A \rvert = \kappa^{\lambda}$$

whenever the sets on the left have cardinalities at all, because $A \approx \kappa$
and $B \approx \lambda$ ([[def-equinumerous]]) and the three constructions
respect $\approx$ (claim (a) of [[lem-cardinal-operations-are-well-defined]],
[[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]). So the operations may be computed from
any representatives.

**Finite and infinite cardinals.** A cardinal $\kappa$ is **finite** when
$\kappa \in \omega$ and **infinite** when $\omega \subseteq \kappa$, that is
$\omega \le \kappa$; by trichotomy ([[lem-ordinal-trichotomy]]) and
[[lem-omega-least-limit-ordinal]] every cardinal is exactly one of the two.

### `thm-cardinal-power-set-and-cantor` — theorem — Assuming the Axiom of Choice, $2^{\\kappa} = \\lvert \\mathcal{P}(\\kappa) \\rvert$, and Cantor's theorem in cardinal form: $\\kappa < 2^{\\kappa}$

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

**Assume the Axiom of Choice** ([[def-axiom-of-choice]]), so that every set has a
cardinality ([[thm-well-ordering-theorem]],
[[lem-cardinality-of-a-well-orderable-set]]). Let $\kappa$ be a cardinal
([[def-cardinal]]) and read $2 = \{0,1\}$ as a cardinal. Then:

**(a)** $2^{\kappa} = \lvert \mathcal{P}(\kappa) \rvert$
([[def-cardinal-arithmetic]]), and more generally
$2^{\lvert A \rvert} = \lvert \mathcal{P}(A) \rvert$ for every set $A$;

**(b)** $\kappa < 2^{\kappa}$.

Clause (b) is [[thm-cantor-powerset]] transcribed into cardinal arithmetic. The
underlying combinatorial fact — that there is no surjection $A \to \mathcal{P}(A)$
— is a theorem of ZF and needs no choice at all; what the Axiom of Choice buys
here is only the right to write $\lvert \mathcal{P}(A) \rvert$ and $2^{\kappa}$
as cardinals in the first place.

### `def-axiom-of-choice` — definition — The Axiom of Choice

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

The **Axiom of Choice** (AC) is the following statement.

> Every family of nonempty sets has a choice function
> ([[def-choice-function]]).

Written out: for every set $\mathcal{F}$ all of whose members are nonempty,
there exists a function $g$ with domain $\mathcal{F}$ satisfying $g(S) \in S$ for
all $S \in \mathcal{F}$.

An equivalent formulation, immediate from the definition of the Cartesian
product, is that a product of nonempty sets is nonempty: if $X_i \ne \emptyset$
for every $i \in I$, then $\prod_{i \in I} X_i \ne \emptyset$.

### `lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n` — lemma — A nonempty set is at most countable iff it is a surjective image of $\\mathbb{N}$

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $A$ be a nonempty set. Then $A$ is at most countable ([[def-countable]]) if
and only if there is a surjection $s : \mathbb{N} \to A$
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

Moreover, from any such surjection an injection $A \to \mathbb{N}$ is obtained
explicitly, without any choice, by

$$j(a) := \min\{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : s(k) = a \,\}.$$

This is the working form of countability used everywhere below: to prove a
nonempty set countable it suffices to list its elements, repetitions and all.

**No choice principle is used.** The backward direction is where an appeal to
choice would be natural ("for each $a$ pick some $k$ with $s(k) = a$") and it is
avoided outright, because $\min$ is canonical: every nonempty set of naturals has
a *least* element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]), so $j(a)$ is determined by
$a$ and $s$ alone.
