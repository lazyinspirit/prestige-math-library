# Wave 5 audit — A6 adversarial proof reading

You are a **read-only adversarial reader** (DeepSeek V4 Pro, max reasoning)
dispatched by the wave-5 audit Alpha of the prestige-math-library published-page
retro-audit (`AUDIT-WORKFLOW.md` step A6). You return **evidence, never edits**,
and you never propose to apply anything yourself. Alpha alone adjudicates.

> **NO SHELL-PERMISSION PROMPTS (owner, 2026-07-30) — binding on every current
> and future agent.** Never ask the owner to approve a command. You have no
> shell at all, so this is automatic for you; it is stated here because the rule
> binds every agent in this workflow verbatim.

**You have no tools and no filesystem.** Everything you are to read is in this
prompt: the item under review in full, and the Statement or Definition text of
every dependency it declares, quoted verbatim from disk. Do not speculate about
text you were not given — if a decision genuinely turns on something absent,
say so explicitly and name what is missing rather than assuming its content.

**Why you specifically.** The audit-side lineup is otherwise entirely Claude:
the Beta that read and retagged these items, the Alpha adjudicating them, and
the certifier reading repairs are all Claude models, and much of this legacy
corpus was Claude-authored too. **You are the only cross-family reader in the
loop.** A shared blind spot among the Claude readers will not show up as
disagreement among them; it can only show up as you finding something they did
not. Do not defer to the fact that a published item has already passed several
readings — this audit has repeatedly confirmed fatal defects in text that had.

**This is a retro-audit of ALREADY-PUBLISHED pages.** The item in front of you
was written, gated, judged and published months ago. Nothing about that history
is evidence that it is correct; it is the reason nobody has re-read it
adversarially since. Wave 3 measured 6 of its 11 confirmed fatal defects in
items the audit had left byte-identical.

## Your standard — the judges' standard

Read every proof step and every cited dependency as someone trying to REFUTE the
item. The point of this audit is to find what is actually wrong, not to confirm
the text reads well.

Mathematical accuracy, logical validity and correct citation of dependencies are NON-NEGOTIABLE: flag any false claim, any step not licensed by its cited facts, and any citation of an item for a claim it does not make. EXPLICITLY ACCEPTABLE, do not flag: minor citational quirks; logical gaps between proof steps that a competent reader closes within 30 SECONDS; other non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter. Library conventions that are NOT defects: sequences are functions on N and N CONTAINS 0, so indices start at 0; a natural number is a von Neumann natural (a set), so 1/k is written 1/iota(k) with iota the canonical natural of the field; the successor of a von Neumann natural n is sigma(n) = n union {n}, so n = {0,1,...,n-1} and sigma(n) = {0,1,...,n} has exactly n+1 elements; sigma(n) is NOT {0,...,n-1}, and an off-by-one objection that rests on reading it that way is a misreading of the library, not a defect; items cite by [L#] into a Facts and Assumptions block; a definition may discharge its own well-definedness inline or via justified_by. Also check the TITLE against what is actually proved: a title asserting more than the proof gives is a defect even when the Statement is correct. CITATION VOICE AND FIDELITY: every [F#], [A#], and [L#] fact must state the cited Definition or Statement itself, exactly when practical or in a concise version preserving its domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, conclusion, and direction.

## Triage — the standing rule, binding

- **Non-negotiable, always report:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity,
  correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort and do NOT report:** minor citational
  quirks; logical gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other
  non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter; prose style; page
  summary length; missing provenance URLs.

**Before alleging a cited dependency is too weak, quote the dependency text you
were given and show exactly what it fails to supply.** A refuter that asserts a
dependency is insufficient without quoting it is producing noise, and this
library's dominant real defect class — a citation of an item for a claim it does
not make — can only be established by that quotation.

**Read the Remarks with a numbered step's suspicion.** Measured across this
audit, Remark and Facts-block prose, not numbered steps, is where nearly every
confirmed fatal defect in this corpus has been found. A Remark that asserts how
some *other* item in the library uses this one is a frequent falsehood: you
cannot check those from here, so say so rather than passing them.

**Choice discipline matters in this wave.** Wave 5 is real analysis and general
topology: countability axioms, separation axioms, nets, filters, ultrafilters
and function spaces. Countable choice, dependent choice, the ultrafilter lemma
and full AC are genuinely different hypotheses here, and this library records
which one an argument spends. A proof that silently uses a choice principle its
Statement does not scope, or a Statement scoping a principle strictly stronger
or weaker than the proof actually needs, is a FATAL defect of the
missing-hypothesis class — not a quibble. Equally, the library has already
adopted AC, countable choice and dependent choice as foundational axioms, so
using one *within its declared scope* is not a defect.

## Output — the only thing you return

Plain markdown. For each finding, one block:

```
### FINDING 1, 2, 3, ... — FATAL or NONFATAL — location: title / Statement / [L#] / step X.Y / Remark
CLAIM AS WRITTEN: "<verbatim quote of the offending text>"
WHY IT FAILS: <the concrete false claim, unlicensed inference, missing
hypothesis, or inaccurate citation — with the verbatim dependency text that
does or does not license it>
WHAT WOULD FIX IT: <the smallest correction you can name, or "not obvious">
```

If, having genuinely tried to refute it, you find nothing fatal, say so plainly
and list what you checked. Finish with one line: `N fatal, M nonfatal`.

A confident empty reading is worse than useless here. Either name a concrete
defect with its quotation, or state clearly that you could not find one.

## Statement

Let $X$ be a set, let $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be a topological space, and give
$Y^{X}$ the topology of pointwise convergence
([[def-topology-of-pointwise-convergence]]). Let $(f_k)$ be a sequence in
$Y^{X}$ and let $f \in Y^{X}$. Then

$$f_k \to f \text{ in } Y^{X} \qquad \Longleftrightarrow \qquad f_k(x) \to f(x) \text{ in } Y \text{ for every } x \in X ,$$

convergence being that of [[def-sequence-convergence-top]] on both sides.

**No uniqueness of limits is asserted on either side.** In a general topological
space a sequence may converge to several points, and the equivalence above is
between two conditions on the pair $((f_k), f)$, not between two values
([[def-sequence-convergence-top]]). No choice principle is used: the only
selection made below is of a least natural number and of a maximum among finitely
many.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $X$, a topological space $(Y,\mathcal{T}_Y)$, the space $Y^{X}$ with the topology of pointwise convergence, a sequence $(f_k)$ in $Y^{X}$ and a point $f \in Y^{X}$; $\iota$ is the canonical natural of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-canonical-natural]]).

[L1] For $x \in X$ and $V \in \mathcal{T}_Y$ the set $\pi_x^{-1}[V] = \{\, g \in Y^{X} : g(x) \in V \,\}$ is open in $Y^{X}$, and the sets $\{\, g \in Y^{X} : g(x_j) \in V_j \text{ for every } j < n \,\}$, for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, points $x_0, \dots, x_{n-1} \in X$ and open $V_0, \dots, V_{n-1} \subseteq Y$, form a basis for the topology of pointwise convergence ([[def-topology-of-pointwise-convergence]], [[def-product-topology]], [[thm-basis-criterion]]).

[L2] A set $N$ is a neighbourhood of a point $p$ exactly when there is an open $U$ with $p \in U \subseteq N$; in particular an open set containing $p$ is a neighbourhood of $p$ ([[def-neighbourhood-top]]).

[L3] $g_k \to g$ in a topological space means: for every neighbourhood $N$ of $g$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $g_k \in N$ for every $k \ge K$ ([[def-sequence-convergence-top]]).

[L4] If $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for a topology and $N$ is a neighbourhood of $g$, then there is $B \in \mathcal{B}$ with $g \in B \subseteq N$ ([[def-neighbourhood-top]], [[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]).

[L5] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L6] For $n \ge 1$ and natural numbers $k_0, \dots, k_{n-1}$ there is an index $j^{\ast} < n$ with $k_j \le k_{j^{\ast}}$ for every $j < n$: the nonempty finite set of reals $\{\iota(k_0), \dots, \iota(k_{n-1})\}$ has a maximum, attained at some index, and $\iota$ is strictly increasing on $\mathbb{N}$, hence reflects the order ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[def-canonical-natural]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Suppose $f_k \to f$ in $Y^{X}$; fix $x \in X$ and a neighbourhood $N$ of $f(x)$ in $Y$, and fix an open $V \subseteq Y$ with $f(x) \in V \subseteq N$. [assume-hyp, L2, choose]

1.2 Suppose instead that $f_k(x) \to f(x)$ in $Y$ for every $x \in X$, and let $N$ be a neighbourhood of $f$ in $Y^{X}$. [assume-hyp, L2]

2.1 Under the assumption of step 1.1: $\pi_x^{-1}[V]$ is open in $Y^{X}$ and contains $f$, hence is a neighbourhood of $f$, so there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $f_k \in \pi_x^{-1}[V]$ for every $k \ge K$, that is $f_k(x) \in V \subseteq N$ for every $k \ge K$. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L3]

2.2 Under the assumption of step 1.2: there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$, points $x_0, \dots, x_{n-1} \in X$ and open $V_0, \dots, V_{n-1} \subseteq Y$ such that $f \in B \subseteq N$, where $B := \{\, g \in Y^{X} : g(x_j) \in V_j \text{ for every } j < n \,\}$. [step 1.2, L1, L4, choose]

3.1 Since $N$ was an arbitrary neighbourhood of $f(x)$ and $x$ an arbitrary point of $X$, step 2.1 says exactly that $f_k(x) \to f(x)$ in $Y$ for every $x \in X$; this is the forward implication. [step 2.1, L3]

3.2 If $n = 0$ in step 2.2 then $B$ is the empty intersection $Y^{X}$, so $f_k \in B \subseteq N$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.2, L1]

3.3 If $n \ge 1$ in step 2.2 then for each $j < n$ the set $A_j := \{\, m \in \mathbb{N} : f_k(x_j) \in V_j \text{ for every } k \ge m \,\}$ is nonempty, because $f \in B$ gives $f(x_j) \in V_j$ with $V_j$ open, hence $V_j$ is a neighbourhood of $f(x_j)$, and $f_k(x_j) \to f(x_j)$; put $N_j := \min A_j$. [step 1.2, step 2.2, L2, L3, L5]

4.1 If $n \ge 1$: there is $j^{\ast} < n$ with $N_j \le N_{j^{\ast}}$ for every $j < n$, and then every $k \ge N_{j^{\ast}}$ satisfies $k \ge N_j$ for every $j < n$, so $f_k(x_j) \in V_j$ for every $j < n$, that is $f_k \in B \subseteq N$. [step 2.2, step 3.3, L6]

5.1 By steps 3.2 and 4.1 there is in either case a $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $f_k \in N$ for every $k \ge K$, namely $K = 0$ when $n = 0$ and $K = N_{j^{\ast}}$ when $n \ge 1$; as $N$ was an arbitrary neighbourhood of $f$, this says $f_k \to f$ in $Y^{X}$, which is the converse implication. [step 3.2, step 4.1, L3]

6.1 Steps 3.1 and 5.1 are the two implications, so the two conditions are equivalent. [step 3.1, step 5.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **This is what the name of the topology records.** The topology of pointwise convergence is defined as the product topology ([[def-topology-of-pointwise-convergence]]), with no reference to sequences; the lemma above is what makes the name accurate, and it is the reason the product topology, rather than the box topology, is the one used on a set of functions.

- **The corresponding statement for the box topology is false.** A basic box constrains a member of $Y^{X}$ at *every* index at once, so a sequence converging in the box topology must converge in a much stronger sense; the failure of the characteristic property of the box topology is recorded on the page that builds it ([[def-product-topology]]).

- **Nothing here makes the pointwise topology well behaved for limits of continuous functions.** A pointwise limit of continuous functions need not be continuous, so $C(X,Y)$ is in general *not* closed in $Y^{X}$ for this topology; that failure is what the uniform topology of this page repairs, and it is witnessed on the companion page.

## The dependencies it declares, quoted verbatim from disk

Each block below is the claim-bearing text of one declared dependency.
These are the only statements the item is entitled to use. If a step
needs more than the text below gives, that is the defect — quote the
dependency text and show exactly what it fails to supply.

### `def-topology-of-pointwise-convergence` — definition — The topology of pointwise convergence on $Y^{X}$, which is the product topology, and its restriction to $C(X,Y)$

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Let $X$ be a set and let $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be a topological space
([[def-topological-space]]). Write

$$Y^{X} \;:=\; \prod_{x \in X} Y ,$$

the product of the constant family whose factor at every index $x \in X$ is $Y$
([[def-product-topology]]). Unwinding that definition, an element of $Y^{X}$ is a
function with domain $X$ taking its value at each $x$ in $Y$; so $Y^{X}$ **is**
the set of all functions $X \to Y$, and the projection at $x$ is evaluation,

$$\pi_x : Y^{X} \to Y, \qquad \pi_x(f) = f(x) .$$

The **topology of pointwise convergence** on $Y^{X}$ is the product topology: the
initial topology of the family $(\pi_x)_{x \in X}$
([[def-initial-and-final-topology]]), that is the topology generated by the
subbasis

$$\mathcal{G} \;:=\; \{\, \pi_x^{-1}[V] \;:\; x \in X,\ V \in \mathcal{T}_Y \,\}, \qquad \pi_x^{-1}[V] = \{\, f \in Y^{X} : f(x) \in V \,\} .$$

By [[thm-basis-criterion]] the finite intersections of members of $\mathcal{G}$
form a basis for it ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]), so the basic open sets are
exactly the sets

$$\{\, f \in Y^{X} \;:\; f(x_j) \in V_j \text{ for every } j < n \,\} \qquad (n \in \mathbb{N},\ x_0, \dots, x_{n-1} \in X,\ V_0, \dots, V_{n-1} \in \mathcal{T}_Y),$$

the value $n = 0$ giving the empty intersection $Y^{X}$ itself. A basic open set
therefore constrains a member of $Y^{X}$ at **finitely many points only**, and
that is the whole content of the topology.

**The restriction to the continuous maps.** Suppose in addition that $X$ carries
a topology, and write

$$C(X,Y) \;:=\; \{\, f \in Y^{X} : f \text{ is continuous} \,\}$$

([[def-continuous-map-top]]). The **topology of pointwise convergence on
$C(X,Y)$** is the subspace topology inherited from $Y^{X}$
([[def-subspace-topology-top]]); its subbasic open sets are the traces
$\pi_x^{-1}[V] \cap C(X,Y)$, since tracing carries a subbasis to a subbasis
([[def-subspace-topology-top]]).

**Nothing on this page gives $C(X,Y)$ a default topology.** The set $C(X,Y)$
carries several different topologies below, and every statement names the one it
means at the point of use.

### `def-sequence-convergence-top` — definition — Convergence and cluster points of a sequence in a topological space, sequential continuity, and the sequential closure

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]), with
neighbourhoods as in [[def-neighbourhood-top]].

A **sequence in $X$** is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to X$, written $(x_k)$ with
$x_k := x(k)$. As everywhere in this library $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
([[def-natural-numbers]]) and a sequence is indexed from $0$
([[def-sequence]]); an index range copied from a text that starts at $1$ must be
shifted before it is used here. The **range** of $(x_k)$ is
$\{\, x_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\}$. Following [[def-sequence]], a property of
indices holds **eventually** if it holds for all $k \ge K$ for some
$K \in \mathbb{N}$, and **frequently** if for every $K$ it holds for some
$k \ge K$; that vocabulary is used here for sequences in an arbitrary set.

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence in $X$ and let $p \in X$.

- $(x_k)$ **converges to $p$**, written $x_k \to p$, if for every neighbourhood
  $N$ of $p$ one has $x_k \in N$ eventually. The point $p$ is then called **a
  limit of $(x_k)$**.
- $p$ is a **cluster point** of $(x_k)$ if for every neighbourhood $N$ of $p$ one
  has $x_k \in N$ frequently.
- For $A \subseteq X$, the **sequential closure** of $A$ is
  $$\operatorname{seqcl}(A) := \{\, p \in X : x_k \to p \text{ for some sequence } (x_k) \text{ with } x_k \in A \text{ for all } k \,\} .$$
- A function $f : X \to Y$ into a topological space $Y$ is **sequentially
  continuous at $p$** if $x_k \to p$ in $X$ implies $f(x_k) \to f(p)$ in $Y$, and
  **sequentially continuous** if it is sequentially continuous at every point of
  $X$ ([[def-continuous-map-top]] for the ordinary notion).

**The notation $\lim_k x_k$ is not available at this generality, and the reason
is not fastidiousness.** In a general topological space a sequence may converge
to more than one point, so there is no function taking a convergent sequence to
"its" limit, and a symbol $\lim_k x_k$ would not denote. In the indiscrete
topology on a set with at least two points the only neighbourhood of any point is
$X$, so **every** sequence converges to **every** point; in the cofinite topology
on an infinite set every injective sequence converges to every point. Both
witnesses are on the companion page. Accordingly this library writes "$p$ is *a*
limit of $(x_k)$" and "$(x_k)$ converges to $p$", never "*the* limit" and never
$\lim_k x_k$, for a sequence in a space that has not been given a hypothesis
restoring uniqueness.

**Where the notation becomes legitimate again.** Uniqueness of limits is what
licenses the symbol, exactly as it does for sequences of reals
([[lem-limit-unique]]) and in a metric space ([[lem-metric-limits-unique]]): in a
metric space a sequence has at most one limit and $\lim_k x_k$ is unambiguous.
Every metrizable space therefore admits the notation, and so does every space in
which distinct points have disjoint neighbourhoods; where this page uses a
metrizable space, and only there, the usual notation is used without further
comment. The general reading of "$x_k \to p$" above never presupposes it.

**Convergence agrees with the metric notion on a metric topology.** For a metric
space the balls around $p$ are a neighbourhood base at $p$
([[lem-metric-ball-neighbourhood-base]]), so "eventually in every neighbourhood
of $p$" and "eventually in every ball around $p$" are the same condition, and the
latter is [[def-metric-convergence]]. The identification is carried out where
metrizable spaces are defined, later on this page.

### `def-product-topology` — definition — The product set $\\prod_{i \\in I} X_i$ of functions choosing a point in each factor, the projections, the box topology, and the product topology as the initial topology of the projections; the empty product is a one-point space

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

**The product set.** Let $I$ be a set and let $X_i$ be a set for each $i \in I$.
The **product** is

$$\prod_{i \in I} X_i \;:=\; \Big\{\, x : x \text{ is a function with domain } I \text{ and } x(i) \in X_i \text{ for every } i \in I \,\Big\},$$

and we write $x_i := x(i)$, the $i$-th **coordinate** of $x$. Two elements of the
product are equal exactly when they agree at every index, functions being equal
when they have the same domain and the same values. For $j \in I$ the $j$-th
**projection** is

$$\pi_j : \prod_{i \in I} X_i \to X_j, \qquad \pi_j(x) := x_j .$$

**Notation for a finite product.** For $I = n$ a natural number, which is the set
$\{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ of its predecessors, an element of $\prod_{k<n} X_k$ is a
function on $n$ and we write it $(x_0, \dots, x_{n-1})$. In particular $I = 2$
gives the **binary product**, written $X \times Y$ for $\prod_{i<2} X_i$ with
$X_0 = X$ and $X_1 = Y$, whose elements are written $(u,v)$ for the function
$0 \mapsto u$, $1 \mapsto v$. This is the only meaning the symbol $X \times Y$
carries on this page.

**Two facts about when the product is nonempty, stated because they are used and
because they cost something.** If some $X_{i_0}$ is empty then the product is
empty, since no function can take a value in $X_{i_0}$. Conversely, suppose every
$X_i$ is nonempty.

- For $I = n$ a natural number, the product is nonempty, and this is a theorem of
  ZF: [[lem-finite-choice]] applied to the function $i \mapsto X_i$ on $n$
  supplies a choice function $g$ for the family of values, and
  $x(i) := g(X_i)$ defines a member of $\prod_{k<n} X_k$.
- For an arbitrary $I$ the assertion "$\prod_{i \in I} X_i \ne \varnothing$
  whenever every $X_i$ is nonempty" **is** the Axiom of Choice: it is the
  formulation recorded in [[def-axiom-of-choice]], and the choice function of
  [[def-choice-function]] is exactly a point of the product of a family by
  itself. Every use of it below is flagged at the step that spends it.

**The box topology.** Now let each $X_i$ carry a topology $\mathcal{T}_i$
([[def-topological-space]]). Put

$$\mathcal{R} \;:=\; \Big\{\, \prod_{i \in I} U_i \;:\; U_i \in \mathcal{T}_i \text{ for every } i \in I \,\Big\},$$

the family of **boxes**. $\mathcal{R}$ is a basis for a topology
([[thm-basis-criterion]]): it contains $\prod_i X_i$, so it covers the product,
and it is closed under binary intersections, since

$$\Big(\prod_i U_i\Big) \cap \Big(\prod_i V_i\Big) = \prod_i (U_i \cap V_i)$$

and each $U_i \cap V_i$ is open by (T3). The topology it generates is the **box
topology** $\mathcal{T}^{\square}$, and $\mathcal{R}$ is a basis for it
([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]).

**The product topology.** The **product topology** $\mathcal{T}^{\Pi}$ on
$\prod_i X_i$ is the initial topology of the family of projections
$(\pi_i)_{i \in I}$ ([[def-initial-and-final-topology]]): the topology generated
by the subbasis

$$\mathcal{G} \;:=\; \{\, \pi_i^{-1}[U] : i \in I,\ U \in \mathcal{T}_i \,\}, \qquad \pi_i^{-1}[U] = \prod_{j \in I} W_j \ \text{ with } W_i = U \text{ and } W_j = X_j \text{ for } j \ne i .$$

By [[thm-basis-criterion]] the finite intersections of members of $\mathcal{G}$
form a basis for $\mathcal{T}^{\Pi}$, and those finite intersections are exactly
the boxes with all but finitely many factors unrestricted:

$$\mathcal{R}^{\Pi} \;=\; \Big\{\, \prod_{i \in I} U_i \;:\; U_i \in \mathcal{T}_i \text{ for every } i, \text{ and } U_i = X_i \text{ for all but finitely many } i \,\Big\}.$$

Indeed the intersection of $\pi_{i_1}^{-1}[U_1], \dots, \pi_{i_n}^{-1}[U_n]$ is
the box whose factor at $i$ is the intersection of those $U_m$ with $i_m = i$ and
is $X_i$ when no $i_m$ equals $i$; and the intersection of no members is the
whole product, the box with every factor $X_i$. Conversely a box with
$U_i = X_i$ off a finite set is such an intersection. Members of
$\mathcal{R}^{\Pi}$ are called **basic product-open** sets, and members of
$\mathcal{R}$ **boxes**. So $\mathcal{R}^{\Pi} \subseteq \mathcal{R}$, with
equality when $I$ is a natural number.

**The empty product.** For $I = \varnothing$ there is exactly one function with
domain $\varnothing$, the empty function, so $\prod_{i \in \varnothing} X_i$ is a
one-point set. A one-point set carries exactly one topology, namely
$\{\varnothing, \{\varnothing\}\}$, since a topology must contain the empty set
and the whole set and there is nothing else to contain
([[def-topological-space]]); so the box topology and the product topology agree
there, and both equal the discrete topology and the indiscrete topology
([[def-standard-topologies]]), which coincide on a one-point set. There are no
projections to speak of, and the initial topology of the empty family is indeed
the indiscrete one ([[def-initial-and-final-topology]]).

**Convention.** Unless the box topology is named explicitly, $\prod_i X_i$ always
carries the product topology in this library. That is not a matter of taste: the
product topology is the one with the characteristic property of the next item,
and the box topology has no such property.

### `def-neighbourhood-top` — definition — Neighbourhood of a point and neighbourhood base, with this library's convention that a neighbourhood need not be open

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]) and let
$x \in X$.

A set $N \subseteq X$ is a **neighbourhood of $x$** if there is an open
$U \in \mathcal{T}$ with $x \in U \subseteq N$. The family of all neighbourhoods
of $x$ is written $\mathcal{N}(x)$ and called the **neighbourhood filter** at
$x$. A neighbourhood that is itself open is an **open neighbourhood**.

**Convention, and it is a live fork: in this library a neighbourhood need not be
open.** The competing convention, used by Munkres among others, defines a
neighbourhood of $x$ to be an *open* set containing $x$. Both are in current use;
this library follows the one above and writes "open neighbourhood" in full
whenever openness is wanted, so that no statement here depends on which
convention a reader brings.

A family $\mathcal{B}_x \subseteq \mathcal{N}(x)$ is a **neighbourhood base at
$x$** if every neighbourhood of $x$ contains a member of $\mathcal{B}_x$: for
every $N \in \mathcal{N}(x)$ there is $B \in \mathcal{B}_x$ with $B \subseteq N$.

**Four immediate consequences, established here because they are used
constantly.**

1. *$X$ is a neighbourhood of each of its points*, since $x \in X \subseteq X$
   and $X$ is open by (T1); so $\mathcal{N}(x) \ne \varnothing$ and every point
   has at least one neighbourhood base, namely $\mathcal{N}(x)$ itself.
2. *A superset of a neighbourhood of $x$ is a neighbourhood of $x$*: if
   $x \in U \subseteq N \subseteq M$ with $U$ open then $x \in U \subseteq M$.
3. *The intersection of two neighbourhoods of $x$ is a neighbourhood of $x$*: if
   $x \in U \subseteq N$ and $x \in V \subseteq M$ with $U, V$ open, then
   $U \cap V$ is open by (T3) and $x \in U \cap V \subseteq N \cap M$. By
   iteration the same holds for any intersection of finitely many
   neighbourhoods of $x$.
4. *A set is open exactly when it is a neighbourhood of each of its points.* If
   $U$ is open and $x \in U$ then $x \in U \subseteq U$. Conversely, if $N$ is a
   neighbourhood of each of its points, choose for each $x \in N$ an open $U_x$
   with $x \in U_x \subseteq N$; then $N = \bigcup_{x \in N} U_x$ is open by (T2).
   No choice principle is involved: $U_x$ may be taken to be the union of *all*
   open subsets of $N$ containing $x$, which is determined by $x$ and $N$, and is
   open by (T2).

**Basic sets give neighbourhood bases.** If $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for
$\mathcal{T}$ ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]) then
$\mathcal{B}_x := \{\, B \in \mathcal{B} : x \in B \,\}$ is a neighbourhood base
at $x$ consisting of open sets. Each such $B$ is open and contains $x$, hence is
a neighbourhood of $x$; and if $N \in \mathcal{N}(x)$, fix open $U$ with
$x \in U \subseteq N$ and then $B \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B \subseteq U$,
which gives $B \in \mathcal{B}_x$ with $B \subseteq N$. A member of
$\mathcal{B}_x$ is called a **basic neighbourhood** of $x$.

### `def-topology-basis-subbasis` — definition — Basis and subbasis for a topology, and the topology generated by a family of sets

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]).

A family $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$ is a **basis for $\mathcal{T}$** if
every open set is a union of members of $\mathcal{B}$: for every
$U \in \mathcal{T}$ there is $\mathcal{B}_U \subseteq \mathcal{B}$ with
$U = \bigcup \mathcal{B}_U$. Equivalently, and this is the form used in proofs,

$$\text{for every } U \in \mathcal{T} \text{ and every } x \in U \text{ there is } B \in \mathcal{B} \text{ with } x \in B \subseteq U .$$

*The two forms say the same thing.* If every open $U$ is such a union and
$x \in U$, then $x$ lies in one of the sets united, which is a member of
$\mathcal{B}$ inside $U$. Conversely, if the displayed condition holds then
$U = \bigcup \{\, B \in \mathcal{B} : B \subseteq U \,\}$, since each such $B$ is
contained in $U$ and each $x \in U$ lies in one of them. Note that
$\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$, so the empty open set is covered by the empty
subfamily and needs no member of $\mathcal{B}$. The members of a basis are called
**basic open sets**.

**The topology generated by a family.** Let $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$
be *any* family of subsets of $X$. Then

$$\langle \mathcal{S} \rangle := \bigcap \{\, \mathcal{T}' : \mathcal{T}' \text{ is a topology on } X \text{ with } \mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{T}' \,\}$$

is a topology on $X$, it contains $\mathcal{S}$, and it is contained in every
topology on $X$ that contains $\mathcal{S}$. It is called the **topology
generated by $\mathcal{S}$**, and $\mathcal{S}$ is a **subbasis** for a topology
$\mathcal{T}$ when $\mathcal{T} = \langle \mathcal{S} \rangle$.

*This is well posed, and the obligation is discharged here.* The collection being
intersected is nonempty, because $\mathcal{P}(X)$ is a topology on $X$ containing
$\mathcal{S}$; so the intersection is an intersection of a nonempty family of
subsets of $\mathcal{P}(X)$ and is a set. It is a topology: $\varnothing$ and $X$
lie in every topology on $X$, hence in the intersection, which is (T1); if
$\mathcal{S}' \subseteq \langle \mathcal{S} \rangle$ then $\mathcal{S}'$ is a
subfamily of each $\mathcal{T}'$ in the collection, so $\bigcup \mathcal{S}'$ lies
in each $\mathcal{T}'$ and hence in the intersection, which is (T2); and the same
argument with $U \cap V$ gives (T3). It contains $\mathcal{S}$ because every
$\mathcal{T}'$ in the collection does, and it is contained in each such
$\mathcal{T}'$ because an intersection is contained in each of its members. So
$\langle \mathcal{S} \rangle$ is the coarsest topology on $X$ containing
$\mathcal{S}$ ([[def-topological-space]]), and in particular it is uniquely
determined by $\mathcal{S}$.

**Neither notion is intrinsic to the family alone.** "$\mathcal{B}$ is a basis
for $\mathcal{T}$" and "$\mathcal{S}$ is a subbasis for $\mathcal{T}$" are
relations between a family and a topology, not properties of the family. The
question of which families are a basis *for some* topology, and how the topology
generated by a subbasis is computed from it, is settled by the next item.

### `thm-basis-criterion` — theorem — A family is a basis for a unique topology iff it covers the set and every point of an intersection of two members lies in a member inside that intersection; finite intersections of any subbasis form a basis

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $X$ be a set, and for $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ write

$$\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{B}} := \{\, U \subseteq X : \text{for every } x \in U \text{ there is } B \in \mathcal{B} \text{ with } x \in B \subseteq U \,\} .$$

1. $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for some topology on $X$ ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]])
   if and only if

   - **(B1)** $\bigcup \mathcal{B} = X$, and
   - **(B2)** for all $B_1, B_2 \in \mathcal{B}$ and every $x \in B_1 \cap B_2$
     there is $B_3 \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B_3 \subseteq B_1 \cap B_2$.

   When (B1) and (B2) hold, that topology is **unique**: it is
   $\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{B}}$, which is also exactly the family of all unions of
   subfamilies of $\mathcal{B}$.

2. Let $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ be an arbitrary family and let
   $\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S}}$ be the family of intersections of finitely many
   members of $\mathcal{S}$. Then $\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S}}$ satisfies (B1) and
   (B2), and $\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S}}} = \langle \mathcal{S} \rangle$,
   the topology generated by $\mathcal{S}$. So the finite intersections of any
   subbasis form a basis for the topology it generates.

**The nullary intersection: this library takes the empty intersection to be $X$.**
In claim 2 the phrase "finitely many" includes **none**, and the intersection of
the empty subfamily of $\mathcal{S}$ is $X$, because the defining condition "lies
in every member of the empty family" holds of every point of $X$. Hence
$X \in \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S}}$ for every $\mathcal{S}$, including
$\mathcal{S} = \varnothing$, and **no covering hypothesis is imposed on a
subbasis**. The competing convention takes only nonempty finite intersections and
compensates by requiring $\bigcup \mathcal{S} = X$; under it claim 2 holds
verbatim once that hypothesis is added, and the two conventions differ only in
which of the two devices supplies (B1). The choice made here is recorded again
among this page's conventions, and it is the reason
$\langle \varnothing \rangle$ comes out as the indiscrete topology
$\{\varnothing, X\}$ rather than being undefined.

### `thm-well-ordering-principle` — theorem — The well-ordering principle

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Statement

Every nonempty subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ has a least element: there is $\ell \in S$ with $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.

### `lem-finite-set-has-max` — lemma — Every nonempty finite set of reals has a maximum and a minimum

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and all $a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n \in \mathbb{R}$, the
set $\{a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ has a maximum and a minimum ([[def-max-min]]).

What is proved below is exactly the displayed statement, by induction on $n$.

The usual reading, that *every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has a
maximum and a minimum*, follows once one identifies the nonempty finite subsets
of $\mathbb{R}$ with the sets listable as $\{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$. That
identification is recorded as a stipulation in the Given below, because this page
has no definition of finiteness to prove it against. **It is discharged, not
merely assumed**: [[lem-finite-subsets-listable]] proves that the two
descriptions of a nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ agree. That lemma is
recorded in `justified_by` rather than in `deps`, since it is about the sets this
lemma quantifies over and therefore depends on this one. This is what licenses
the notation
$\max\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ and $\min\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ for finite sets of
**real** numbers from this page onwards.

### `def-max-min` — definition — Maximum and minimum of a set

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $m \in \mathbb{R}$.

- $m$ is a **maximum** (or *greatest element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $s \le m$
  for every $s \in S$.
- $m$ is a **minimum** (or *least element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $m \le s$
  for every $s \in S$.

A set has at most one maximum: if $m_1$ and $m_2$ are both maxima then
$m_1 \in S$ gives $m_1 \le m_2$ and $m_2 \in S$ gives $m_2 \le m_1$, so
$m_1 = m_2$ by antisymmetry of the order, which is immediate from the trichotomy
axiom of an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).
The same argument applies to minima, so we may write $\max S$ and $\min S$.

### `def-canonical-natural` — definition — The canonical natural $\\iota(n) = n \\cdot 1_F$ of a field

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]) with additive identity $0_F$ and
multiplicative identity $1_F$. Define
$\iota : \mathbb{N} \to F$ by recursion on $\mathbb{N}$
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[thm-recursion]]):

$$\iota(0) \;:=\; 0_F, \qquad \iota(n+1) \;:=\; \iota(n) + 1_F .$$

$\iota(n)$ is the **canonical natural** of $n$ in $F$. It is also written
$n \cdot 1_F$, and for $n \ge 1$ it is $1_F$ added to itself $n$ times.

**Why the notation is needed at all.** A natural number in this library is a von
Neumann natural, that is a set ([[def-natural-numbers]]), and a set is not an
element of $F$. So $1/n$, $n^{\alpha}$ and $x/n$ are not expressions of $F$ when
$n$ is a natural: what they mean is $1/\iota(n)$, $\iota(n)^{\alpha}$ and
$x/\iota(n)$. The map $\iota$ is what carries a counting number into the field,
and writing it is the whole reason a reader meets $1/\iota(k+1)$ where an
informal text would write $1/(k+1)$.

### `lem-of-naturals-positive` — lemma — Canonical naturals are positive and strictly increasing

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field, with field structure as in [[def-field]], and for
$n \ge 1$ let $n \cdot 1_F$ denote the canonical natural number
$\underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$, defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$
and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$. Then for every $n \ge 1$:

- $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$;
- the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$;
- $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ and $(mn) \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F)$ for all $m, n \ge 1$.
