# Wave 5 audit — A6 adversarial proof reading

You are a **read-only adversarial reader** (DeepSeek V4 Pro, max reasoning)
dispatched by the wave-5 audit Alpha of the prestige-math-library published-page
retro-audit (`AUDIT-WORKFLOW.md` step A6). You return **evidence, never edits**,
and you never propose to apply anything yourself. Alpha alone adjudicates.

> **NO SHELL-PERMISSION PROMPTS (owner, 2026-07-30) — binding on every current
> and future agent.** Never ask the owner to approve a command. You have no
> shell at all, so this is automatic for you; it is stated here because the rule
> binds every agent in this workflow verbatim.

**You have no tools and no filesystem.** Everything you are to read is in this
prompt: the item under review in full, and the Statement or Definition text of
every dependency it declares, quoted verbatim from disk. Do not speculate about
text you were not given — if a decision genuinely turns on something absent,
say so explicitly and name what is missing rather than assuming its content.

**Why you specifically.** The audit-side lineup is otherwise entirely Claude:
the Beta that read and retagged these items, the Alpha adjudicating them, and
the certifier reading repairs are all Claude models, and much of this legacy
corpus was Claude-authored too. **You are the only cross-family reader in the
loop.** A shared blind spot among the Claude readers will not show up as
disagreement among them; it can only show up as you finding something they did
not. Do not defer to the fact that a published item has already passed several
readings — this audit has repeatedly confirmed fatal defects in text that had.

**This is a retro-audit of ALREADY-PUBLISHED pages.** The item in front of you
was written, gated, judged and published months ago. Nothing about that history
is evidence that it is correct; it is the reason nobody has re-read it
adversarially since. Wave 3 measured 6 of its 11 confirmed fatal defects in
items the audit had left byte-identical.

## Your standard — the judges' standard

Read every proof step and every cited dependency as someone trying to REFUTE the
item. The point of this audit is to find what is actually wrong, not to confirm
the text reads well.

Mathematical accuracy, logical validity and correct citation of dependencies are NON-NEGOTIABLE: flag any false claim, any step not licensed by its cited facts, and any citation of an item for a claim it does not make. EXPLICITLY ACCEPTABLE, do not flag: minor citational quirks; logical gaps between proof steps that a competent reader closes within 30 SECONDS; other non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter. Library conventions that are NOT defects: sequences are functions on N and N CONTAINS 0, so indices start at 0; a natural number is a von Neumann natural (a set), so 1/k is written 1/iota(k) with iota the canonical natural of the field; the successor of a von Neumann natural n is sigma(n) = n union {n}, so n = {0,1,...,n-1} and sigma(n) = {0,1,...,n} has exactly n+1 elements; sigma(n) is NOT {0,...,n-1}, and an off-by-one objection that rests on reading it that way is a misreading of the library, not a defect; items cite by [L#] into a Facts and Assumptions block; a definition may discharge its own well-definedness inline or via justified_by. Also check the TITLE against what is actually proved: a title asserting more than the proof gives is a defect even when the Statement is correct. CITATION VOICE AND FIDELITY: every [F#], [A#], and [L#] fact must state the cited Definition or Statement itself, exactly when practical or in a concise version preserving its domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, conclusion, and direction.

## Triage — the standing rule, binding

- **Non-negotiable, always report:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity,
  correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort and do NOT report:** minor citational
  quirks; logical gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other
  non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter; prose style; page
  summary length; missing provenance URLs.

**Before alleging a cited dependency is too weak, quote the dependency text you
were given and show exactly what it fails to supply.** A refuter that asserts a
dependency is insufficient without quoting it is producing noise, and this
library's dominant real defect class — a citation of an item for a claim it does
not make — can only be established by that quotation.

**Read the Remarks with a numbered step's suspicion.** Measured across this
audit, Remark and Facts-block prose, not numbered steps, is where nearly every
confirmed fatal defect in this corpus has been found. A Remark that asserts how
some *other* item in the library uses this one is a frequent falsehood: you
cannot check those from here, so say so rather than passing them.

**Choice discipline matters in this wave.** Wave 5 is real analysis and general
topology: countability axioms, separation axioms, nets, filters, ultrafilters
and function spaces. Countable choice, dependent choice, the ultrafilter lemma
and full AC are genuinely different hypotheses here, and this library records
which one an argument spends. A proof that silently uses a choice principle its
Statement does not scope, or a Statement scoping a principle strictly stronger
or weaker than the proof actually needs, is a FATAL defect of the
missing-hypothesis class — not a quibble. Equally, the library has already
adopted AC, countable choice and dependent choice as foundational axioms, so
using one *within its declared scope* is not a defect.

## Output — the only thing you return

Plain markdown. For each finding, one block:

```
### FINDING 1, 2, 3, ... — FATAL or NONFATAL — location: title / Statement / [L#] / step X.Y / Remark
CLAIM AS WRITTEN: "<verbatim quote of the offending text>"
WHY IT FAILS: <the concrete false claim, unlicensed inference, missing
hypothesis, or inaccurate citation — with the verbatim dependency text that
does or does not license it>
WHAT WOULD FIX IT: <the smallest correction you can name, or "not obvious">
```

If, having genuinely tried to refute it, you find nothing fatal, say so plainly
and list what you checked. Finish with one line: `N fatal, M nonfatal`.

A confident empty reading is worse than useless here. Either name a concrete
defect with its quotation, or state clearly that you could not find one.

# This dispatch

# Citation-precision audit — do these citing items state their target correctly?

You are reading a **published legacy corpus** of this library. Below are one or
more TARGET items, each quoted as it actually stands on disk, followed by every
place in this audit wave that cites it.

**The one question for every citing line:** does the citing text state the
target's own proposition — same domain, same quantifiers, same hypotheses, same
direction, same strength — or does it state something the target does not
actually give? A fact that quietly drops a hypothesis, flips an implication,
promotes an implication to a biconditional, or widens a domain is a **FATAL**
defect of the incorrect-dependency-citation class. It is this library's single
most common confirmed defect, and it is only visible by reading the two texts
against each other, which is what this file lets you do.

Do NOT report: a concise but faithful shortening (that is the required house
style); a paraphrase that preserves content; wording you would have chosen
differently; missing URLs; prose style. A citing line reading as a shortened
but faithful version of the target is CORRECT and must not be flagged.

Where a citing line says a dependency is declared but never cited in the body,
say whether that looks like a stale declaration or a use that lost its citation
— that one is NONFATAL either way.

For every finding use the block format from the brief, and finish with the
`N fatal, M nonfatal` line. If every citation is faithful, say so plainly and
name the targets you checked.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `lem-finite-set-has-max`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/lem-finite-set-has-max.md` — lemma — Every nonempty finite set of reals has a maximum and a minimum

#### Statement

For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and all $a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n \in \mathbb{R}$, the
set $\{a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ has a maximum and a minimum ([[def-max-min]]).

What is proved below is exactly the displayed statement, by induction on $n$.

The usual reading, that *every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has a
maximum and a minimum*, follows once one identifies the nonempty finite subsets
of $\mathbb{R}$ with the sets listable as $\{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$. That
identification is recorded as a stipulation in the Given below, because this page
has no definition of finiteness to prove it against. **It is discharged, not
merely assumed**: [[lem-finite-subsets-listable]] proves that the two
descriptions of a nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ agree. That lemma is
recorded in `justified_by` rather than in `deps`, since it is about the sets this
lemma quantifies over and therefore depends on this one. This is what licenses
the notation
$\max\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ and $\min\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ for finite sets of
**real** numbers from this page onwards.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space.md` — lemma — The absolute value makes $\\mathbb{R}$ a metric space: $d(x,y) = |x-y|$ is a metric, its open balls are the intervals $(x-r, x+r)$, and it is unbounded

#### Statement

Define $d_{\mathbb{R}} : \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ by
$d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) := |x - y|$ ([[def-abs-value]]). Then:

1. $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ is a metric on $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-metric-space]]); it is
   called the **usual metric** of $\mathbb{R}$.
2. For $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and $r > 0$ the open ball is the bounded open interval
   ([[def-interval]], [[def-metric-ball]])
   $$B(x,r) = (x-r,\ x+r),$$
   and the closed ball is $\bar B(x,r) = [x-r,\ x+r]$.
3. Consequently $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is open in the metric topology of
   $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-metric-topology]]) exactly when for every $x \in U$
   there is $r > 0$ with $(x-r, x+r) \subseteq U$. This topology is called the
   **usual topology** of $\mathbb{R}$.
4. $(\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$ is not a bounded metric space
   ([[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]): no ball contains $\mathbb{R}$, so
   $\operatorname{diam}(\mathbb{R})$ is not defined.

#### Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field, with field structure as in [[def-field]], and for
$n \ge 1$ let $n \cdot 1_F$ denote the canonical natural number
$\underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$, defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$
and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$. Then for every $n \ge 1$:

- $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$;
- the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$;
- $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ and $(mn) \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F)$ for all $m, n \ge 1$.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `cor-archimedean-reciprocal`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/cor-archimedean-reciprocal.md` — corollary — For every $\\varepsilon > 0$ in a complete ordered field there is a natural $n \\ge 1$ with $1/n < \\varepsilon$

#### Statement

Let $F$ be a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and let
$\varepsilon \in F$ with $\varepsilon > 0$. Then there is a natural number
$n \ge 1$ such that

$$\frac{1}{n \cdot 1_F} < \varepsilon ,$$

where $n \cdot 1_F$ is the canonical natural of $F$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]]) and
$1/(n \cdot 1_F)$ is its multiplicative inverse ([[def-field]]). As is standard
we abbreviate $n \cdot 1_F$ to $n$ and write the conclusion $1/n < \varepsilon$.

This is the **reciprocal form** of the Archimedean property.
[[thm-of-archimedean]] on its own delivers only the assertion that the canonical
naturals are cofinal, $x < n \cdot 1_F$; the form actually used in analysis, that
the reciprocals of the naturals get below every positive bound, is the statement
above, and it is recorded separately so that no proof has to reconstruct the
inversion step in passing.
