# Wave 5 audit — A6 adversarial proof reading

You are a **read-only adversarial reader** (DeepSeek V4 Pro, max reasoning)
dispatched by the wave-5 audit Alpha of the prestige-math-library published-page
retro-audit (`AUDIT-WORKFLOW.md` step A6). You return **evidence, never edits**,
and you never propose to apply anything yourself. Alpha alone adjudicates.

> **NO SHELL-PERMISSION PROMPTS (owner, 2026-07-30) — binding on every current
> and future agent.** Never ask the owner to approve a command. You have no
> shell at all, so this is automatic for you; it is stated here because the rule
> binds every agent in this workflow verbatim.

**You have no tools and no filesystem.** Everything you are to read is in this
prompt: the item under review in full, and the Statement or Definition text of
every dependency it declares, quoted verbatim from disk. Do not speculate about
text you were not given — if a decision genuinely turns on something absent,
say so explicitly and name what is missing rather than assuming its content.

**Why you specifically.** The audit-side lineup is otherwise entirely Claude:
the Beta that read and retagged these items, the Alpha adjudicating them, and
the certifier reading repairs are all Claude models, and much of this legacy
corpus was Claude-authored too. **You are the only cross-family reader in the
loop.** A shared blind spot among the Claude readers will not show up as
disagreement among them; it can only show up as you finding something they did
not. Do not defer to the fact that a published item has already passed several
readings — this audit has repeatedly confirmed fatal defects in text that had.

**This is a retro-audit of ALREADY-PUBLISHED pages.** The item in front of you
was written, gated, judged and published months ago. Nothing about that history
is evidence that it is correct; it is the reason nobody has re-read it
adversarially since. Wave 3 measured 6 of its 11 confirmed fatal defects in
items the audit had left byte-identical.

## Your standard — the judges' standard

Read every proof step and every cited dependency as someone trying to REFUTE the
item. The point of this audit is to find what is actually wrong, not to confirm
the text reads well.

Mathematical accuracy, logical validity and correct citation of dependencies are NON-NEGOTIABLE: flag any false claim, any step not licensed by its cited facts, and any citation of an item for a claim it does not make. EXPLICITLY ACCEPTABLE, do not flag: minor citational quirks; logical gaps between proof steps that a competent reader closes within 30 SECONDS; other non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter. Library conventions that are NOT defects: sequences are functions on N and N CONTAINS 0, so indices start at 0; a natural number is a von Neumann natural (a set), so 1/k is written 1/iota(k) with iota the canonical natural of the field; the successor of a von Neumann natural n is sigma(n) = n union {n}, so n = {0,1,...,n-1} and sigma(n) = {0,1,...,n} has exactly n+1 elements; sigma(n) is NOT {0,...,n-1}, and an off-by-one objection that rests on reading it that way is a misreading of the library, not a defect; items cite by [L#] into a Facts and Assumptions block; a definition may discharge its own well-definedness inline or via justified_by. Also check the TITLE against what is actually proved: a title asserting more than the proof gives is a defect even when the Statement is correct. CITATION VOICE AND FIDELITY: every [F#], [A#], and [L#] fact must state the cited Definition or Statement itself, exactly when practical or in a concise version preserving its domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, conclusion, and direction.

## Triage — the standing rule, binding

- **Non-negotiable, always report:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity,
  correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort and do NOT report:** minor citational
  quirks; logical gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other
  non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter; prose style; page
  summary length; missing provenance URLs.

**Before alleging a cited dependency is too weak, quote the dependency text you
were given and show exactly what it fails to supply.** A refuter that asserts a
dependency is insufficient without quoting it is producing noise, and this
library's dominant real defect class — a citation of an item for a claim it does
not make — can only be established by that quotation.

**Read the Remarks with a numbered step's suspicion.** Measured across this
audit, Remark and Facts-block prose, not numbered steps, is where nearly every
confirmed fatal defect in this corpus has been found. A Remark that asserts how
some *other* item in the library uses this one is a frequent falsehood: you
cannot check those from here, so say so rather than passing them.

**Choice discipline matters in this wave.** Wave 5 is real analysis and general
topology: countability axioms, separation axioms, nets, filters, ultrafilters
and function spaces. Countable choice, dependent choice, the ultrafilter lemma
and full AC are genuinely different hypotheses here, and this library records
which one an argument spends. A proof that silently uses a choice principle its
Statement does not scope, or a Statement scoping a principle strictly stronger
or weaker than the proof actually needs, is a FATAL defect of the
missing-hypothesis class — not a quibble. Equally, the library has already
adopted AC, countable choice and dependent choice as foundational axioms, so
using one *within its declared scope* is not a defect.

## Output — the only thing you return

Plain markdown. For each finding, one block:

```
### FINDING 1, 2, 3, ... — FATAL or NONFATAL — location: title / Statement / [L#] / step X.Y / Remark
CLAIM AS WRITTEN: "<verbatim quote of the offending text>"
WHY IT FAILS: <the concrete false claim, unlicensed inference, missing
hypothesis, or inaccurate citation — with the verbatim dependency text that
does or does not license it>
WHAT WOULD FIX IT: <the smallest correction you can name, or "not obvious">
```

If, having genuinely tried to refute it, you find nothing fatal, say so plainly
and list what you checked. Finish with one line: `N fatal, M nonfatal`.

A confident empty reading is worse than useless here. Either name a concrete
defect with its quotation, or state clearly that you could not find one.

## Statement

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a $T_4$ space, that is a normal $T_1$ space
([[def-normal-and-t4-spaces]], [[def-t0-and-t1-spaces]]). Then $X$ is regular
([[def-regular-and-t3-spaces]]), hence $T_3$, and therefore also Urysohn
([[def-urysohn-space]]), Hausdorff ([[def-hausdorff-space]]), $T_1$ and $T_0$.

**The $T_1$ hypothesis is not decoration.** Normality alone implies none of the
conclusions: the indiscrete topology on a two-point set is normal and not even
$T_0$, which is recorded among this page's false statements.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A topological space $(X,\mathcal{T})$ that is normal and $T_1$, a closed set $C \subseteq X$ and a point $x \in X \setminus C$.

[A1] Normality: disjoint closed sets admit disjoint open supersets ([[def-normal-and-t4-spaces]]).

[A2] $X$ is regular when a point and a closed set not containing it admit disjoint open supersets; $T_3$ means regular and $T_1$ ([[def-regular-and-t3-spaces]]).

[L1] In a $T_1$ space every singleton is closed ([[thm-t1-iff-singletons-are-closed]], clause (b)).

[L2] Every regular $T_1$ space is Urysohn, every Urysohn space is Hausdorff, and every Hausdorff space is $T_1$ and hence $T_0$ ([[lem-urysohn-sits-between-hausdorff-and-regular-plus-t1]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $\{x\}$ is closed, since $X$ is $T_1$. [L1]

1.2 $\{x\} \cap C = \varnothing$, since $x \notin C$. [given]

2.1 By [A1] applied to the disjoint closed sets $\{x\}$ and $C$ there are disjoint open $U \supseteq \{x\}$ and $V \supseteq C$; in particular $x \in U$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, A1]

3.1 Since $C$ and $x \notin C$ were arbitrary, step 2.1 shows that $X$ is regular; being also $T_1$, it is $T_3$. [step 2.1, A2]

4.1 By [L2] the space $X$ is Urysohn, hence Hausdorff, hence $T_1$ and $T_0$; with step 3.1 this is the whole statement. [step 3.1, L2] ∎

## Remarks

- **The proof is one line and the hypothesis does all the work.** Normality separates two *closed* sets; the $T_1$ hypothesis is exactly what turns the point into one of them. This is the pattern of every "$T_{n+1}$ implies $T_n$" argument in the chain, and it is why this library never builds $T_1$ silently into the words *regular* and *normal* ([[def-normal-and-t4-spaces]]).

- **The converse is not proved here and is not asserted.** Whether a $T_3$ space must be normal is left open on this page: every witness reachable from this page's material would need machinery it does not have, so no false statement asserting a reversal is planted here ([[rem-separation-axiom-conventions]]).

## The dependencies it declares, quoted verbatim from disk

Each block below is the claim-bearing text of one declared dependency.
These are the only statements the item is entitled to use. If a step
needs more than the text below gives, that is the defect — quote the
dependency text and show exactly what it fails to supply.

### `def-normal-and-t4-spaces` — definition — Normal spaces and $T_4$ spaces, with the source disagreement over whether normality includes $T_1$ stated explicitly

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]).

- $X$ is **normal** when any two disjoint closed sets can be separated by
  disjoint open sets: for all closed $A, B \subseteq X$ with
  $A \cap B = \varnothing$ there are $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$ with
  $$A \subseteq U, \qquad B \subseteq V, \qquad U \cap V = \varnothing .$$
- $X$ is **$T_4$** when it is normal **and** $T_1$ ([[def-t0-and-t1-spaces]]).

Either of $A$, $B$ may be empty, and those cases are met by $U = \varnothing$ or
$V = \varnothing$ together with $X$; so the condition hides no nonemptiness
hypothesis. As with regularity, "disjoint open sets" may equivalently be read as
"disjoint open neighbourhoods of the two sets" ([[def-neighbourhood-top]]).

**Normality is the special case of complete normality at a disjoint closed
pair.** Disjoint closed sets are separated in the sense of
[[def-separated-sets]], since the closure of a closed set is itself; so a space
in which every *separated* pair can be put into disjoint open sets is in
particular normal. That stronger condition is defined later on this page, and the
implication is proved there.

**The convention fork, and this library's side of it.** Exactly as for
regularity, textbooks disagree about whether *normal* carries a $T_1$ hypothesis.
Munkres builds it in; Kelley, Willard and Engelking do not. **This library takes
the second side**: *normal* names the separation condition alone, $T_4$ names
normal plus $T_1$, and the $T_1$ hypothesis is written out wherever it is used.
The reason is again that the two halves are independent, and here the point is
sharp: **normality without $T_1$ implies nothing at all** in the hierarchy. The
indiscrete topology on a two-point set ([[def-standard-topologies]]) is normal,
its only closed sets being $\varnothing$ and the whole space, and it is not even
$T_0$; Sierpinski space is normal, $T_0$ and not regular. Both are recorded on
this page, the first as a false statement and both on the companion page.

### `def-regular-and-t3-spaces` — definition — Regular spaces and $T_3$ spaces, with the source disagreement over whether regularity includes $T_1$ stated explicitly

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]).

- $X$ is **regular** when a point can be separated from a closed set not
  containing it: for every closed $C \subseteq X$ and every
  $x \in X \setminus C$ there are $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$ with
  $$x \in U, \qquad C \subseteq V, \qquad U \cap V = \varnothing .$$
- $X$ is **$T_3$** when it is regular **and** $T_1$ ([[def-t0-and-t1-spaces]]).

Since an open set containing a point is an open neighbourhood of it
([[def-neighbourhood-top]]), regularity reads: $x$ and $C$ have disjoint open
neighbourhoods. The case $C = \varnothing$ is allowed and is satisfied by
$U = X$, $V = \varnothing$, so no nonemptiness is hidden in the condition.

**The convention fork, and this library's side of it.** Textbooks disagree about
whether the word *regular* carries a $T_1$ hypothesis. Munkres builds it in,
defining a regular space to be one in which points are closed and the separation
condition above holds; Kelley, Willard and Engelking do not, and reserve $T_3$
for the conjunction. **This library takes the second side**: *regular* names the
separation condition alone, $T_3$ names regular plus $T_1$, and every statement
that needs points to be closed writes the $T_1$ hypothesis out. The reason is
that the two halves are genuinely independent and each is used alone below: the
indiscrete topology on a two-point set is regular and not $T_0$
([[def-standard-topologies]]), and the cofinite topology on an infinite set is
$T_1$ and not regular, both witnessed on the companion page.

**Regularity alone implies no other separation axiom.** It does not imply $T_0$,
$T_1$ or Hausdorff ([[def-hausdorff-space]]): in the indiscrete topology on a set
$X$ the only closed sets are $\varnothing$ and $X$, so the only pair $(C, x)$ to
be separated has $C = \varnothing$, and $U = X$, $V = \varnothing$ separates it;
yet no two distinct points are distinguished by any open set. Conversely $T_1$
does not imply regularity. It is the *conjunction* $T_3$ that sits above
Hausdorff in the hierarchy, and the proof of that is two items below.

### `def-t0-and-t1-spaces` — definition — $T_0$ (Kolmogorov) and $T_1$ (Frechet) spaces

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]).

- $X$ is **$T_0$**, or a **Kolmogorov space**, when any two distinct points are
  *topologically distinguishable*: for all $x, y \in X$ with $x \ne y$ there is
  an open set containing exactly one of $x$ and $y$.
- $X$ is **$T_1$**, or a **Frechet space**, when each of any two distinct points
  has an open set containing it and missing the other: for all $x, y \in X$ with
  $x \ne y$ there are $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$ with

$$x \in U, \quad y \notin U, \qquad y \in V, \quad x \notin V .$$

Nothing is asserted about a pair of equal points, so a space with at most one
point satisfies both conditions vacuously.

Since an open set containing a point is an open neighbourhood of it
([[def-neighbourhood-top]]), both conditions may be read with "open
neighbourhood" in place of "open set"; and by the same equivalence recorded in
[[def-neighbourhood-top]] they may be read with arbitrary neighbourhoods, since
a neighbourhood of $x$ contains an open one and an open neighbourhood is a
neighbourhood.

**Every $T_1$ space is $T_0$, and this is discharged here** rather than left to
the reader, because it is the bottom arrow of the whole hierarchy on this page.
Let $x \ne y$ and take $U, V$ as in the $T_1$ condition. Then $U$ is an open set
containing $x$ and not $y$, so it contains exactly one of the two points, which
is the $T_0$ condition. Only the first half of the $T_1$ condition is used, so
the implication does not reverse formally, and it does not reverse in fact:
Sierpinski space is a witness, recorded on the companion page.

**The two conditions differ exactly in symmetry.** $T_0$ asks for *one* open set
that tells the pair apart, with no control over which of the two it contains;
$T_1$ asks for *both* separations at once. In Sierpinski space
$(\{a,b\}, \{\varnothing, \{b\}, \{a,b\}\})$ of [[def-standard-topologies]] the
open set $\{b\}$ contains $b$ and not $a$, so the space is $T_0$; but the only
open set containing $a$ is the whole space, which also contains $b$, so it is
not $T_1$.

**Neither condition is a property of a set alone.** Both are properties of the
pair $(X, \mathcal{T})$, and both are inherited upwards along the comparison
order of [[def-topological-space]]: if $\mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2$
and $(X,\mathcal{T}_1)$ is $T_0$, respectively $T_1$, then so is
$(X,\mathcal{T}_2)$, since the separating open sets of the coarser topology lie
in the finer one. In particular the discrete topology satisfies both, and the
indiscrete topology on a set with at least two points satisfies neither.

### `thm-t1-iff-singletons-are-closed` — theorem — A space is $T_1$ if and only if every singleton is closed, if and only if every finite subset is closed, if and only if its topology contains the cofinite topology

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Statement

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]) and let
$\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{cof}}$ be the cofinite topology on the set $X$
([[def-standard-topologies]]). The following four conditions are equivalent.

- **(a)** $X$ is $T_1$ ([[def-t0-and-t1-spaces]]).
- **(b)** $\{x\}$ is closed for every $x \in X$.
- **(c)** $F$ is closed for every finite $F \subseteq X$ ([[def-countable]]).
- **(d)** $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{cof}} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$, that is, the
  topology of $X$ is finer than the cofinite topology on the same set.

Condition (d) says that the cofinite topology is the **coarsest** $T_1$ topology
on any set: it is $T_1$ by the equivalence, and every $T_1$ topology on that set
contains it.

### `lem-urysohn-sits-between-hausdorff-and-regular-plus-t1` — lemma — Every Urysohn space is Hausdorff, every Hausdorff space is $T_1$ and hence $T_0$, and every regular $T_1$ space is Urysohn

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]). Then:

1. If $X$ is Urysohn ([[def-urysohn-space]]) then $X$ is Hausdorff
   ([[def-hausdorff-space]]).
2. If $X$ is Hausdorff then $X$ is $T_1$, and hence $T_0$
   ([[def-t0-and-t1-spaces]]).
3. If $X$ is regular ([[def-regular-and-t3-spaces]]) and $T_1$ — that is, if $X$
   is $T_3$ — then $X$ is Urysohn.

Consequently $T_3$ implies $T_{2\frac12}$, which implies $T_2$, which implies
$T_1$, which implies $T_0$. Nothing here asserts that any of the four
implications reverses; two of the failures are recorded among this page's false
statements.

### `def-hausdorff-space` — definition — Hausdorff space: distinct points have disjoint open neighbourhoods; every metrizable space is Hausdorff and the indiscrete topology on two points is not

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ ([[def-topological-space]]) is
**Hausdorff** when any two distinct points are separated by disjoint open sets:
for all $x, y \in X$ with $x \ne y$ there are $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$ with

$$x \in U, \qquad y \in V, \qquad U \cap V = \varnothing .$$

Since an open set containing a point is an open neighbourhood of it
([[def-neighbourhood-top]]), the condition reads: distinct points have disjoint
open neighbourhoods. Nothing is asserted about points that are equal, and the
condition is vacuous for a space with at most one point, so every such space is
Hausdorff.

**Every metrizable space is Hausdorff.** This is not proved here, because it is
already discharged: [[def-metrizable-space]] records it among the two things
every metrizable space has, deriving it from
[[thm-metric-hausdorff-separation]], which separates $p \ne q$ in a metric space
by the disjoint open balls $B(p,r)$ and $B(q,r)$ with $r = d(p,q)/2 > 0$. In
particular $\mathbb{R}$ with its usual topology, every $\mathbb{R}^n$, and every
subspace of a metrizable space are Hausdorff.

**Not every space is Hausdorff.** The indiscrete topology
$\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{ind}} = \{\varnothing, X\}$ on a set $X = \{a,b\}$ with
$a \ne b$ ([[def-standard-topologies]]) is not: the only open set containing $a$
is $X$, the only one containing $b$ is $X$, and $X \cap X = X \ne \varnothing$.
This is the same two-point space that [[def-metrizable-space]] uses to exhibit a
topology induced by no metric, and the reason is the same one: failure of the
Hausdorff condition is an obstruction to metrizability.

**Being Hausdorff is a topological property** ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]).
If $h : X \to Z$ is a homeomorphism and $X$ is Hausdorff, then for $z \ne z'$ in
$Z$ the points $h^{-1}(z)$ and $h^{-1}(z')$ are distinct, so they have disjoint
open $U, V$; the images $h[U]$ and $h[V]$ are open, disjoint, and contain $z$ and
$z'$ respectively, a homeomorphism carrying the open sets of one space
bijectively onto those of the other. So no space homeomorphic to a Hausdorff
space fails the condition.

**Scope of this item.** Only the definition, the metrizable case and the
two-point failure are recorded here, because that is all this page uses. The
Hausdorff condition is one of a graded family of separation axioms; that family,
its ordering, and the questions of which of its members are hereditary or
preserved by products, are not available at this point in the reading order and
nothing here anticipates them. What this page does use is a single negative
result: a quotient of a Hausdorff space need not be Hausdorff, which is recorded
below as a false statement and witnessed on the companion page.

### `def-urysohn-space` — definition — Urysohn ($T_{2\\frac{1}{2}}$) space: distinct points have neighbourhoods with disjoint closures

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]), with
closures as in [[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]. Then $X$ is an **Urysohn
space**, also written **$T_{2\frac{1}{2}}$**, when any two distinct points have
open neighbourhoods whose *closures* are disjoint: for all $x, y \in X$ with
$x \ne y$ there are $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$ with

$$x \in U, \qquad y \in V, \qquad \overline{U} \cap \overline{V} = \varnothing .$$

Equivalently, by [[def-neighbourhood-top]], distinct points have disjoint closed
neighbourhoods: if $U$ and $V$ are as displayed then $\overline{U}$ and
$\overline{V}$ are disjoint closed neighbourhoods of $x$ and $y$; conversely
disjoint closed neighbourhoods $K \ni x$ and $L \ni y$ contain open
$U \ni x$ and $V \ni y$ with $\overline{U} \subseteq K$ and
$\overline{V} \subseteq L$, since $K$ and $L$ are closed, so the closures are
disjoint.

The condition is vacuous for a space with at most one point, and nothing is
asserted about equal points.

**The condition strictly strengthens the Hausdorff condition** on its face:
$U \subseteq \overline{U}$ and $V \subseteq \overline{V}$, so disjointness of the
closures forces disjointness of $U$ and $V$ and hence the Hausdorff property
([[def-hausdorff-space]]). That implication is proved as the next item, together
with the implication that puts Urysohn spaces below the regular $T_1$ spaces.
This page does not exhibit a Hausdorff space that is not Urysohn, and it does not
assert that one exists: every witness reachable from the material developed here
would need machinery this page does not have, so the question whether the
implication reverses is left open here.

**A live naming collision, flagged here and settled in this page's
conventions.** Two different conditions travel under Urysohn's name:

- the one defined above, separation of points by *disjoint closed
  neighbourhoods*, which is what this library calls **Urysohn** and
  $T_{2\frac{1}{2}}$;
- separation of points by a *continuous real-valued function*, which is usually
  called **completely Hausdorff** and which this library does not define.

Some texts exchange the two names. Neither is **Urysohn's lemma**, a theorem
about normal spaces that is not proved on this page at all
([[rem-separation-axiom-conventions]]).

### `def-topological-space` — definition — Topology on a set, open and closed sets, clopen sets, the closed-set axiomatisation, and the coarser/finer comparison

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $X$ be a set and write $\mathcal{P}(X)$ for its power set. A **topology** on
$X$ is a family $\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ such that

- **(T1)** $\varnothing \in \mathcal{T}$ and $X \in \mathcal{T}$;
- **(T2)** $\bigcup \mathcal{S} \in \mathcal{T}$ for every $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$;
- **(T3)** $U \cap V \in \mathcal{T}$ for all $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$.

A **topological space** is a pair $(X, \mathcal{T})$ consisting of a set $X$ and
a topology $\mathcal{T}$ on it; the elements of $X$ are its **points**. When only
one topology is in play we write $X$ for the pair; when several are, the topology
is always named.

The members of $\mathcal{T}$ are the **open** sets of $(X,\mathcal{T})$. A subset
$F \subseteq X$ is **closed** when its complement $X \setminus F$ is open, and
**clopen** when it is both open and closed. By (T1) both $\varnothing$ and $X$
are clopen. *Open and closed are not opposites*: a set may be neither, and it may
be both, so "not open" is never a synonym for "closed".

**Finite intersections, and the empty one.** Axiom (T3) is stated for two sets
because that is all that is ever needed: if $n \ge 1$ and
$U_1, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{T}$, then $U_1 \cap \dots \cap U_n \in \mathcal{T}$
follows by iterating (T3) $n-1$ times. The intersection of the **empty** family
of subsets of $X$ is $X$, since the condition "lies in every member of the empty
family" is vacuous; that case is covered by (T1) rather than by (T3), which is
one of the two reasons $X \in \mathcal{T}$ is demanded outright. The other is
that (T2) alone gives only $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$.

**The closed sets, and the dual axiomatisation.** Put
$\mathcal{C} := \{\, X \setminus U : U \in \mathcal{T} \,\}$, the family of closed
sets. Then

- **(C1)** $\varnothing \in \mathcal{C}$ and $X \in \mathcal{C}$;
- **(C2)** $\bigcap \mathcal{D} \in \mathcal{C}$ for every **nonempty**
  $\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$;
- **(C3)** $C \cup D \in \mathcal{C}$ for all $C, D \in \mathcal{C}$.

Conversely, if a family $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ satisfies (C1),
(C2) and (C3), then $\mathcal{T} := \{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{C} \,\}$
is a topology on $X$ whose closed sets are exactly the members of $\mathcal{C}$.
So a topology may be presented equally well by its open sets or by its closed
sets, and this library uses whichever is shorter.

*Both directions are one computation, and it is carried out here rather than
assumed.* The map $U \mapsto X \setminus U$ is an involution of
$\mathcal{P}(X)$, hence a bijection, and it carries the two De Morgan identities

$$X \setminus \bigcup_{i \in I} A_i = \bigcap_{i \in I} (X \setminus A_i) \quad (I \ne \varnothing), \qquad X \setminus \bigcap_{i \in I} A_i = \bigcup_{i \in I} (X \setminus A_i) \quad (I \ne \varnothing)$$

term by term into each other. Given (T1)–(T3): $\varnothing = X \setminus X$ and
$X = X \setminus \varnothing$ lie in $\mathcal{C}$, which is (C1); for nonempty
$\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$ the family
$\mathcal{S} = \{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{D} \,\}$ lies in $\mathcal{T}$
and $\bigcap \mathcal{D} = X \setminus \bigcup \mathcal{S}$ is closed by (T2),
which is (C2); and $C \cup D = X \setminus ((X \setminus C) \cap (X \setminus D))$
is closed by (T3), which is (C3). Given (C1)–(C3) the same three lines run
backwards, the empty-union case $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$ being supplied
by (C1) rather than by (C2); and $\{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{C} \,\}$ has
$\mathcal{C}$ as its family of complements because complementation is an
involution.

**Comparison of topologies.** If $\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ are
topologies on the same set $X$ and $\mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2$, then
$\mathcal{T}_1$ is **coarser** than $\mathcal{T}_2$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ is
**finer** than $\mathcal{T}_1$; the comparison is **strict** when the inclusion
is. Inclusion is a partial order on the set of topologies on $X$
([[def-partial-order]]), and it is not a total one: two topologies on the same
set may be incomparable.
