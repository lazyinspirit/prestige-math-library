# Wave 5 audit — A6 adversarial proof reading

You are a **read-only adversarial reader** (DeepSeek V4 Pro, max reasoning)
dispatched by the wave-5 audit Alpha of the prestige-math-library published-page
retro-audit (`AUDIT-WORKFLOW.md` step A6). You return **evidence, never edits**,
and you never propose to apply anything yourself. Alpha alone adjudicates.

> **NO SHELL-PERMISSION PROMPTS (owner, 2026-07-30) — binding on every current
> and future agent.** Never ask the owner to approve a command. You have no
> shell at all, so this is automatic for you; it is stated here because the rule
> binds every agent in this workflow verbatim.

**You have no tools and no filesystem.** Everything you are to read is in this
prompt: the item under review in full, and the Statement or Definition text of
every dependency it declares, quoted verbatim from disk. Do not speculate about
text you were not given — if a decision genuinely turns on something absent,
say so explicitly and name what is missing rather than assuming its content.

**Why you specifically.** The audit-side lineup is otherwise entirely Claude:
the Beta that read and retagged these items, the Alpha adjudicating them, and
the certifier reading repairs are all Claude models, and much of this legacy
corpus was Claude-authored too. **You are the only cross-family reader in the
loop.** A shared blind spot among the Claude readers will not show up as
disagreement among them; it can only show up as you finding something they did
not. Do not defer to the fact that a published item has already passed several
readings — this audit has repeatedly confirmed fatal defects in text that had.

**This is a retro-audit of ALREADY-PUBLISHED pages.** The item in front of you
was written, gated, judged and published months ago. Nothing about that history
is evidence that it is correct; it is the reason nobody has re-read it
adversarially since. Wave 3 measured 6 of its 11 confirmed fatal defects in
items the audit had left byte-identical.

## Your standard — the judges' standard

Read every proof step and every cited dependency as someone trying to REFUTE the
item. The point of this audit is to find what is actually wrong, not to confirm
the text reads well.

Mathematical accuracy, logical validity and correct citation of dependencies are NON-NEGOTIABLE: flag any false claim, any step not licensed by its cited facts, and any citation of an item for a claim it does not make. EXPLICITLY ACCEPTABLE, do not flag: minor citational quirks; logical gaps between proof steps that a competent reader closes within 30 SECONDS; other non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter. Library conventions that are NOT defects: sequences are functions on N and N CONTAINS 0, so indices start at 0; a natural number is a von Neumann natural (a set), so 1/k is written 1/iota(k) with iota the canonical natural of the field; the successor of a von Neumann natural n is sigma(n) = n union {n}, so n = {0,1,...,n-1} and sigma(n) = {0,1,...,n} has exactly n+1 elements; sigma(n) is NOT {0,...,n-1}, and an off-by-one objection that rests on reading it that way is a misreading of the library, not a defect; items cite by [L#] into a Facts and Assumptions block; a definition may discharge its own well-definedness inline or via justified_by. Also check the TITLE against what is actually proved: a title asserting more than the proof gives is a defect even when the Statement is correct. CITATION VOICE AND FIDELITY: every [F#], [A#], and [L#] fact must state the cited Definition or Statement itself, exactly when practical or in a concise version preserving its domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, conclusion, and direction.

## Triage — the standing rule, binding

- **Non-negotiable, always report:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity,
  correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort and do NOT report:** minor citational
  quirks; logical gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other
  non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter; prose style; page
  summary length; missing provenance URLs.

**Before alleging a cited dependency is too weak, quote the dependency text you
were given and show exactly what it fails to supply.** A refuter that asserts a
dependency is insufficient without quoting it is producing noise, and this
library's dominant real defect class — a citation of an item for a claim it does
not make — can only be established by that quotation.

**Read the Remarks with a numbered step's suspicion.** Measured across this
audit, Remark and Facts-block prose, not numbered steps, is where nearly every
confirmed fatal defect in this corpus has been found. A Remark that asserts how
some *other* item in the library uses this one is a frequent falsehood: you
cannot check those from here, so say so rather than passing them.

**Choice discipline matters in this wave.** Wave 5 is real analysis and general
topology: countability axioms, separation axioms, nets, filters, ultrafilters
and function spaces. Countable choice, dependent choice, the ultrafilter lemma
and full AC are genuinely different hypotheses here, and this library records
which one an argument spends. A proof that silently uses a choice principle its
Statement does not scope, or a Statement scoping a principle strictly stronger
or weaker than the proof actually needs, is a FATAL defect of the
missing-hypothesis class — not a quibble. Equally, the library has already
adopted AC, countable choice and dependent choice as foundational axioms, so
using one *within its declared scope* is not a defect.

## Output — the only thing you return

Plain markdown. For each finding, one block:

```
### FINDING 1, 2, 3, ... — FATAL or NONFATAL — location: title / Statement / [L#] / step X.Y / Remark
CLAIM AS WRITTEN: "<verbatim quote of the offending text>"
WHY IT FAILS: <the concrete false claim, unlicensed inference, missing
hypothesis, or inaccurate citation — with the verbatim dependency text that
does or does not license it>
WHAT WOULD FIX IT: <the smallest correction you can name, or "not obvious">
```

If, having genuinely tried to refute it, you find nothing fatal, say so plainly
and list what you checked. Finish with one line: `N fatal, M nonfatal`.

A confident empty reading is worse than useless here. Either name a concrete
defect with its quotation, or state clearly that you could not find one.

## Example

Let $S_\omega=(\mathbb N\times\mathbb N)\cup\{\infty\}$, with all $(n,m)$ isolated. A neighbourhood of $\infty$ contains $\infty$ and, for every $n$, all but finitely many $(n,m)$ on the $n$-th spoke. This is the sequential fan. It is Fréchet–Urysohn but not first countable.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The sequential fan and a subset $A\subseteq S_\omega$.

[A1] A space is Fréchet–Urysohn when closure points are limits of sequences from the set, and first countability means a countable local base ([[def-frechet-urysohn-and-sequential-spaces]], [[def-first-countable-top]]).

[L1] Every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb N$ has a maximum, every nonempty subset of $\mathbb N$ has a least member, and recursion defines sequences from uniquely specified successive terms ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[thm-well-ordering-principle]], [[thm-recursion]]).


## Verification

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 Suppose $\infty\in\overline A$. If every spoke met $A$ only finitely, define $$ f(n)= \begin{cases} 0,&\{m:(n,m)\in A\}=\varnothing,\\ 1+\max\{m:(n,m)\in A\},&\text{otherwise}. \end{cases} $$ This is a canonically defined function by [L1], and the neighbourhood containing on spoke $n$ exactly the points $(n,m)$ with $m\ge f(n)$ misses $A$, a contradiction. Hence one spoke meets $A$ infinitely. [A1, L1, construct]

1.2 Suppose $(B_k)$ were a countable neighbourhood base at $\infty$. For each $k,n$, let $f_k(n)$ be the least threshold such that $(n,m)\in B_k$ for every $m\ge f_k(n)$; it exists and is unique by [L1]. Form the neighbourhood whose threshold on spoke $k$ is $g(k)=f_k(k)+1$. [A1, L1, construct]

2.1 On the infinite spoke supplied by step 1.1, recursion and least elements from [L1] list the second coordinates increasingly. The resulting sequence in $A$ is eventually beyond every threshold on that spoke, hence converges to $\infty$. Isolated closure points already lie in $A$, so $S_\omega$ is Fréchet–Urysohn. [step 1.1, A1, L1]

2.2 The point $(k,f_k(k))$ lies in $B_k$ but not in this neighbourhood, so no $B_k$ is contained in it. This contradicts the base property. [step 1.2, A1]

3.1 Therefore the sequential fan is Fréchet–Urysohn and not first countable. [step 2.1, step 2.2, discharge-construct] ∎

## The dependencies it declares, quoted verbatim from disk

Each block below is the claim-bearing text of one declared dependency.
These are the only statements the item is entitled to use. If a step
needs more than the text below gives, that is the defect — quote the
dependency text and show exactly what it fails to supply.

### `def-frechet-urysohn-and-sequential-spaces` — definition — Fréchet–Urysohn spaces and sequential spaces

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

A topological space $X$ is **Fréchet–Urysohn** if, whenever $p\in\overline A$, there is a sequence in $A$ converging to $p$. Equivalently, $\operatorname{seqcl}(A)=\overline A$ for every $A\subseteq X$, since sequential closure is always contained in closure ([[lem-sequential-closure-inside-closure]]).

A subset $C\subseteq X$ is **sequentially closed** if every sequence in $C$ that converges in $X$ has its limit in $C$. The space is **sequential** if every sequentially closed subset is closed. Equivalently, $\operatorname{seqcl}(A)=A$ implies $\overline A=A$ for every $A\subseteq X$.

### `def-first-countable-top` — definition — First countable space: a countable neighbourhood base at every point

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ ([[def-topological-space]]) is **first
countable** if every point of $X$ has an at most countable neighbourhood base:
for each $x \in X$ there is a family
$\mathcal{B}_x \subseteq \mathcal{N}(x)$ that is at most countable
([[def-countable]], [[def-equinumerous]]) and such that every neighbourhood of
$x$ contains a member of $\mathcal{B}_x$ ([[def-neighbourhood-top]]).

**"Countable" here means "at most countable"**, as everywhere in this library
([[def-countable]]), so a *finite* neighbourhood base is permitted. That is not a
degenerate case: in a discrete space the one-element family $\{\{x\}\}$ is a
neighbourhood base at $x$, so every discrete space is first countable, and in an
indiscrete space $\{X\}$ is a neighbourhood base at every point.

**The base may be taken to consist of open sets, and it may be taken
decreasing.** If $\mathcal{B}_x$ is an at most countable neighbourhood base at
$x$, then replacing each $N \in \mathcal{B}_x$ by an open $U_N$ with
$x \in U_N \subseteq N$ gives an at most countable neighbourhood base of open
sets. Making the base decreasing, that is arranging
$M_0 \supseteq M_1 \supseteq \dots$, requires enumerating it and forming the
running finite intersections; both operations are carried out inside the proof of
the theorem that uses them, the next item, where the enumeration and the
recursion are cited explicitly rather than assumed here.

**First countability is a topological property**
([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]): a homeomorphism $h : X \to Y$ carries a
neighbourhood base at $x$ to a neighbourhood base at $h(x)$, since
$N \mapsto h[N]$ is a bijection between the neighbourhood filters preserving
inclusion, and a bijection preserves at most countability
([[def-equinumerous]]).

### `def-topology-basis-subbasis` — definition — Basis and subbasis for a topology, and the topology generated by a family of sets

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]).

A family $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$ is a **basis for $\mathcal{T}$** if
every open set is a union of members of $\mathcal{B}$: for every
$U \in \mathcal{T}$ there is $\mathcal{B}_U \subseteq \mathcal{B}$ with
$U = \bigcup \mathcal{B}_U$. Equivalently, and this is the form used in proofs,

$$\text{for every } U \in \mathcal{T} \text{ and every } x \in U \text{ there is } B \in \mathcal{B} \text{ with } x \in B \subseteq U .$$

*The two forms say the same thing.* If every open $U$ is such a union and
$x \in U$, then $x$ lies in one of the sets united, which is a member of
$\mathcal{B}$ inside $U$. Conversely, if the displayed condition holds then
$U = \bigcup \{\, B \in \mathcal{B} : B \subseteq U \,\}$, since each such $B$ is
contained in $U$ and each $x \in U$ lies in one of them. Note that
$\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$, so the empty open set is covered by the empty
subfamily and needs no member of $\mathcal{B}$. The members of a basis are called
**basic open sets**.

**The topology generated by a family.** Let $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$
be *any* family of subsets of $X$. Then

$$\langle \mathcal{S} \rangle := \bigcap \{\, \mathcal{T}' : \mathcal{T}' \text{ is a topology on } X \text{ with } \mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{T}' \,\}$$

is a topology on $X$, it contains $\mathcal{S}$, and it is contained in every
topology on $X$ that contains $\mathcal{S}$. It is called the **topology
generated by $\mathcal{S}$**, and $\mathcal{S}$ is a **subbasis** for a topology
$\mathcal{T}$ when $\mathcal{T} = \langle \mathcal{S} \rangle$.

*This is well posed, and the obligation is discharged here.* The collection being
intersected is nonempty, because $\mathcal{P}(X)$ is a topology on $X$ containing
$\mathcal{S}$; so the intersection is an intersection of a nonempty family of
subsets of $\mathcal{P}(X)$ and is a set. It is a topology: $\varnothing$ and $X$
lie in every topology on $X$, hence in the intersection, which is (T1); if
$\mathcal{S}' \subseteq \langle \mathcal{S} \rangle$ then $\mathcal{S}'$ is a
subfamily of each $\mathcal{T}'$ in the collection, so $\bigcup \mathcal{S}'$ lies
in each $\mathcal{T}'$ and hence in the intersection, which is (T2); and the same
argument with $U \cap V$ gives (T3). It contains $\mathcal{S}$ because every
$\mathcal{T}'$ in the collection does, and it is contained in each such
$\mathcal{T}'$ because an intersection is contained in each of its members. So
$\langle \mathcal{S} \rangle$ is the coarsest topology on $X$ containing
$\mathcal{S}$ ([[def-topological-space]]), and in particular it is uniquely
determined by $\mathcal{S}$.

**Neither notion is intrinsic to the family alone.** "$\mathcal{B}$ is a basis
for $\mathcal{T}$" and "$\mathcal{S}$ is a subbasis for $\mathcal{T}$" are
relations between a family and a topology, not properties of the family. The
question of which families are a basis *for some* topology, and how the topology
generated by a subbasis is computed from it, is settled by the next item.

### `thm-recursion` — theorem — The recursion theorem

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Statement

Let $(N,0,\sigma)$ be a Peano system ([[def-peano-system]]), in particular the natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]). For any set $A$, any element $a \in A$, and any function $f : A \to A$, there is a unique function $g : N \to A$ such that $g(0) = a$ and $g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n))$ for all $n \in N$.

### `lem-finite-set-has-max` — lemma — Every nonempty finite set of reals has a maximum and a minimum

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and all $a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n \in \mathbb{R}$, the
set $\{a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ has a maximum and a minimum ([[def-max-min]]).

What is proved below is exactly the displayed statement, by induction on $n$.

The usual reading, that *every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has a
maximum and a minimum*, follows once one identifies the nonempty finite subsets
of $\mathbb{R}$ with the sets listable as $\{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$. That
identification is recorded as a stipulation in the Given below, because this page
has no definition of finiteness to prove it against. **It is discharged, not
merely assumed**: [[lem-finite-subsets-listable]] proves that the two
descriptions of a nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ agree. That lemma is
recorded in `justified_by` rather than in `deps`, since it is about the sets this
lemma quantifies over and therefore depends on this one. This is what licenses
the notation
$\max\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ and $\min\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ for finite sets of
**real** numbers from this page onwards.

### `thm-well-ordering-principle` — theorem — The well-ordering principle

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Statement

Every nonempty subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ has a least element: there is $\ell \in S$ with $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.
