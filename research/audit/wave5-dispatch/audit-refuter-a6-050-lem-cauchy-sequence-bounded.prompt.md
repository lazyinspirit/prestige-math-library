# Wave 5 audit — A6 adversarial proof reading

You are a **read-only adversarial reader** (DeepSeek V4 Pro, max reasoning)
dispatched by the wave-5 audit Alpha of the prestige-math-library published-page
retro-audit (`AUDIT-WORKFLOW.md` step A6). You return **evidence, never edits**,
and you never propose to apply anything yourself. Alpha alone adjudicates.

> **NO SHELL-PERMISSION PROMPTS (owner, 2026-07-30) — binding on every current
> and future agent.** Never ask the owner to approve a command. You have no
> shell at all, so this is automatic for you; it is stated here because the rule
> binds every agent in this workflow verbatim.

**You have no tools and no filesystem.** Everything you are to read is in this
prompt: the item under review in full, and the Statement or Definition text of
every dependency it declares, quoted verbatim from disk. Do not speculate about
text you were not given — if a decision genuinely turns on something absent,
say so explicitly and name what is missing rather than assuming its content.

**Why you specifically.** The audit-side lineup is otherwise entirely Claude:
the Beta that read and retagged these items, the Alpha adjudicating them, and
the certifier reading repairs are all Claude models, and much of this legacy
corpus was Claude-authored too. **You are the only cross-family reader in the
loop.** A shared blind spot among the Claude readers will not show up as
disagreement among them; it can only show up as you finding something they did
not. Do not defer to the fact that a published item has already passed several
readings — this audit has repeatedly confirmed fatal defects in text that had.

**This is a retro-audit of ALREADY-PUBLISHED pages.** The item in front of you
was written, gated, judged and published months ago. Nothing about that history
is evidence that it is correct; it is the reason nobody has re-read it
adversarially since. Wave 3 measured 6 of its 11 confirmed fatal defects in
items the audit had left byte-identical.

## Your standard — the judges' standard

Read every proof step and every cited dependency as someone trying to REFUTE the
item. The point of this audit is to find what is actually wrong, not to confirm
the text reads well.

Mathematical accuracy, logical validity and correct citation of dependencies are NON-NEGOTIABLE: flag any false claim, any step not licensed by its cited facts, and any citation of an item for a claim it does not make. EXPLICITLY ACCEPTABLE, do not flag: minor citational quirks; logical gaps between proof steps that a competent reader closes within 30 SECONDS; other non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter. Library conventions that are NOT defects: sequences are functions on N and N CONTAINS 0, so indices start at 0; a natural number is a von Neumann natural (a set), so 1/k is written 1/iota(k) with iota the canonical natural of the field; the successor of a von Neumann natural n is sigma(n) = n union {n}, so n = {0,1,...,n-1} and sigma(n) = {0,1,...,n} has exactly n+1 elements; sigma(n) is NOT {0,...,n-1}, and an off-by-one objection that rests on reading it that way is a misreading of the library, not a defect; items cite by [L#] into a Facts and Assumptions block; a definition may discharge its own well-definedness inline or via justified_by. Also check the TITLE against what is actually proved: a title asserting more than the proof gives is a defect even when the Statement is correct. CITATION VOICE AND FIDELITY: every [F#], [A#], and [L#] fact must state the cited Definition or Statement itself, exactly when practical or in a concise version preserving its domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, conclusion, and direction.

## Triage — the standing rule, binding

- **Non-negotiable, always report:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity,
  correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort and do NOT report:** minor citational
  quirks; logical gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other
  non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter; prose style; page
  summary length; missing provenance URLs.

**Before alleging a cited dependency is too weak, quote the dependency text you
were given and show exactly what it fails to supply.** A refuter that asserts a
dependency is insufficient without quoting it is producing noise, and this
library's dominant real defect class — a citation of an item for a claim it does
not make — can only be established by that quotation.

**Read the Remarks with a numbered step's suspicion.** Measured across this
audit, Remark and Facts-block prose, not numbered steps, is where nearly every
confirmed fatal defect in this corpus has been found. A Remark that asserts how
some *other* item in the library uses this one is a frequent falsehood: you
cannot check those from here, so say so rather than passing them.

**Choice discipline matters in this wave.** Wave 5 is real analysis and general
topology: countability axioms, separation axioms, nets, filters, ultrafilters
and function spaces. Countable choice, dependent choice, the ultrafilter lemma
and full AC are genuinely different hypotheses here, and this library records
which one an argument spends. A proof that silently uses a choice principle its
Statement does not scope, or a Statement scoping a principle strictly stronger
or weaker than the proof actually needs, is a FATAL defect of the
missing-hypothesis class — not a quibble. Equally, the library has already
adopted AC, countable choice and dependent choice as foundational axioms, so
using one *within its declared scope* is not a defect.

## Output — the only thing you return

Plain markdown. For each finding, one block:

```
### FINDING 1, 2, 3, ... — FATAL or NONFATAL — location: title / Statement / [L#] / step X.Y / Remark
CLAIM AS WRITTEN: "<verbatim quote of the offending text>"
WHY IT FAILS: <the concrete false claim, unlicensed inference, missing
hypothesis, or inaccurate citation — with the verbatim dependency text that
does or does not license it>
WHAT WOULD FIX IT: <the smallest correction you can name, or "not obvious">
```

If, having genuinely tried to refute it, you find nothing fatal, say so plainly
and list what you checked. Finish with one line: `N fatal, M nonfatal`.

A confident empty reading is worse than useless here. Either name a concrete
defect with its quotation, or state clearly that you could not find one.

## Statement

Every Cauchy sequence of reals is bounded: if $(x_k)$ is a Cauchy sequence
([[def-real-limit]]) then there is $M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for every
$k \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-sequence]]).

This is the real-number counterpart of the lemma proving the same statement for
Cauchy sequences of rationals inside $\mathbb{Q}$, and the argument is the same
one: the Cauchy condition at a single value of $\varepsilon$
confines all but finitely many terms, and the finitely many exceptions are
handled by a maximum.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A Cauchy sequence $(x_k)$ of reals.

[A1] Cauchy condition: for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$ ([[def-real-limit]]).

[L1] Triangle inequality: $|x| = |(x - y) + y| \le |x - y| + |y|$ for all reals $x, y$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L2] Every nonempty finite list of reals has a maximum, so $\max\{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$ is a well-determined real that dominates each listed value ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L3] The rational $1$ is positive, and the embedding of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ carries it to $1 \in \mathbb{R}$, so $\varepsilon = 1$ is an admissible test value in [A1] ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L4] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: translation invariance, $a < b \Rightarrow a + c < b + c$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]); and the mixed transitivity $a \le b < c \Rightarrow a < c$, immediate from the reading of $a \le b$ as "$a < b$ or $a = b$" together with transitivity of $<$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total, so every index satisfies $k \le K$ or $k \ge K$ ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

[L6] A sequence of reals is bounded when some $M \in \mathbb{R}$ satisfies $|x_k| \le M$ at every index ([[def-sequence]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Apply [A1] with the rational test value $\varepsilon = 1$: fix $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $|x_k - x_l| < 1$ for all $k, l \ge K$. [A1, L3, choose]

1.2 For all reals $x_k$ and $x_K$ the triangle inequality gives $|x_k| \le |x_k - x_K| + |x_K|$. [L1]

2.1 For every $k \ge K$: $|x_k - x_K| < 1$ by step 1.1, and adding $|x_K|$ to both sides then combining with step 1.2 gives $|x_k| < |x_K| + 1$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L4]

2.2 Define $M := \max\{\,|x_0|, |x_1|, \dots, |x_K|, |x_K| + 1\,\}$, the maximum of a nonempty finite list of reals, which exists by [L2]. [step 1.1, L2, choose]

3.1 For every $k \le K$: $|x_k|$ is one of the listed values, so $|x_k| \le M$. [step 2.2, L2]

3.2 For every $k \ge K$: $|x_k| < |x_K| + 1 \le M$, since $|x_K| + 1$ is one of the listed values. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L2]

4.1 Every index satisfies $k \le K$ or $k \ge K$, so $|x_k| \le M$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and $(x_k)$ is bounded. [step 3.1, step 3.2, L5, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- **One value of $\varepsilon$ suffices, and $\varepsilon = 1$ is not special.**
  Any single positive rational would do; what matters is that the Cauchy
  condition confines all terms from some index onward to within a fixed distance
  of one term, after which only finitely many terms remain, and a finite list of
  reals has a maximum ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]). This is the same division of
  labour as in [[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]].

- **The converse is false.** A bounded sequence need not be Cauchy: the
  alternating sequence of [[fs-bounded-implies-convergent]] is bounded and, being
  divergent, is not Cauchy ([[lem-convergent-implies-cauchy]] would otherwise
  make it convergent by [[thm-cauchy-criterion-via-lub]]). Boundedness is
  strictly weaker, and what it does yield is a convergent *subsequence*
  ([[thm-bolzano-weierstrass]]).

- **No completeness is used.** The argument runs in any ordered field, and it is
  used here as the first of the three steps by which the least-upper-bound
  property is converted into Cauchy completeness in
  [[thm-cauchy-criterion-via-lub]].

- The rational counterpart, proved on the Cauchy-construction page, is
  [[lem-cauchy-bounded]]. It is the house-style exemplar for this argument, and
  nothing here depends on it, since the two lemmas live in different fields.

## The dependencies it declares, quoted verbatim from disk

Each block below is the claim-bearing text of one declared dependency.
These are the only statements the item is entitled to use. If a step
needs more than the text below gives, that is the defect — quote the
dependency text and show exactly what it fails to supply.

### `def-real-limit` — definition — Limits and Cauchy sequences of reals

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals **converges** to $x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for
every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with
$|x_k - x| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$. It is **Cauchy** when for
every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with
$|x_k - x_l| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$.

### `def-sequence` — definition — Sequences of reals: bounded, eventually, frequently, tails, subsequences

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]],
[[def-real-numbers]]) with its order and absolute value ([[def-real-order]]), and
$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers with its order ([[def-natural-numbers]],
[[def-nat-order]]).

A **sequence of reals** is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$. We write
$x_k$ for the value $x(k)$, call it the **$k$-th term**, and write $(x_k)$, or
$(x_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$, for the function itself. The **range** of $(x_k)$ is
the subset $\{\, x_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals and let $P$ be a property of indices.

- $(x_k)$ is **bounded** if there is $M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for
  every $k \in \mathbb{N}$; it is **unbounded** otherwise.
- $P$ holds **eventually** if there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $P(k)$ holds
  for every $k \ge K$.
- $P$ holds **frequently** if for every $K \in \mathbb{N}$ there is some
  $k \ge K$ for which $P(k)$ holds.
- For $K \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$K$-th tail** of $(x_k)$ is the sequence
  $x^{(K)}$ defined by $x^{(K)}_j := x_{j + K}$ for $j \in \mathbb{N}$; it is
  again a sequence of reals.
- A function $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is **strictly increasing** if
  $n_j < n_k$ whenever $j < k$. For such an $n$, the **subsequence** of $(x_k)$
  along $n$ is the composite $x \circ n$, written $(x_{n_k})_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$;
  it is again a sequence of reals.

**Convergence and Cauchyness are not defined here.** They are already fixed, for
sequences of reals, by the published [[def-real-limit]]: $(x_k)$ *converges* to
$x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is
$K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$, and $(x_k)$
is *Cauchy* when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$
with $|x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$. This page builds the
toolkit for those two notions and does not restate them. A sequence
**converges** if it converges to some real, and **diverges** if it does not.

### `lem-finite-set-has-max` — lemma — Every nonempty finite set of reals has a maximum and a minimum

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and all $a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n \in \mathbb{R}$, the
set $\{a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ has a maximum and a minimum ([[def-max-min]]).

What is proved below is exactly the displayed statement, by induction on $n$.

The usual reading, that *every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has a
maximum and a minimum*, follows once one identifies the nonempty finite subsets
of $\mathbb{R}$ with the sets listable as $\{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$. That
identification is recorded as a stipulation in the Given below, because this page
has no definition of finiteness to prove it against. **It is discharged, not
merely assumed**: [[lem-finite-subsets-listable]] proves that the two
descriptions of a nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ agree. That lemma is
recorded in `justified_by` rather than in `deps`, since it is about the sets this
lemma quantifies over and therefore depends on this one. This is what licenses
the notation
$\max\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ and $\min\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ for finite sets of
**real** numbers from this page onwards.

### `lem-of-triangle-inequality` — lemma — The triangle inequality

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$. Then

$$|x + y| \le |x| + |y|.$$

### `def-max-min` — definition — Maximum and minimum of a set

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $m \in \mathbb{R}$.

- $m$ is a **maximum** (or *greatest element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $s \le m$
  for every $s \in S$.
- $m$ is a **minimum** (or *least element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $m \le s$
  for every $s \in S$.

A set has at most one maximum: if $m_1$ and $m_2$ are both maxima then
$m_1 \in S$ gives $m_1 \le m_2$ and $m_2 \in S$ gives $m_2 \le m_1$, so
$m_1 = m_2$ by antisymmetry of the order, which is immediate from the trichotomy
axiom of an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).
The same argument applies to minima, so we may write $\max S$ and $\min S$.

### `lem-rat-embeds-dense` — lemma — The rationals embed densely in the reals

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

The map $q \mapsto \hat q$ ([[def-real-numbers]]) is an embedding of ordered
fields. Every real is approximated by rationals: for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and
rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ with
$|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$. Consequently, strictly between any two
reals lies a rational.

### `lem-of-add-order` — lemma — Order is preserved by adding a constant and by adding inequalities

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b, c, d \in F$.

1. **Translation invariance.** If $a < b$ then $a + c < b + c$.
2. **Adding inequalities.** If $a < b$ and $c < d$ then $a + c < b + d$.

### `thm-nat-linear-order` — theorem — $\\le$ is a linear order on $\\mathbb{N}$

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

The relation $\le$ on $\mathbb{N}$, where $m \le n \iff \exists k\ (m + k = n)$ ([[def-nat-order]]), is a linear (total) order: reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive, and total.

### `def-complete-ordered-field` — definition — Complete ordered field (least-upper-bound property)

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq F$.

- $u \in F$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$; $S$ is
  **bounded above** if it has an upper bound.
- $u \in F$ is a **least upper bound** (or **supremum**, $\sup S$) of $S$ if $u$
  is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le u'$ for every upper bound $u'$ of $S$.

$F$ is a **complete ordered field** (equivalently, $F$ has the
**least-upper-bound property**, or is **Dedekind complete**) if every nonempty
$S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$.

### `def-ordered-field` — definition — Ordered field

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ ([[def-field]]) together with a subset
$P \subseteq F$, the set of **positive** elements (the *positive cone*),
satisfying:

- **(O1) Trichotomy.** For each $x \in F$, exactly one of the following holds:
  $x \in P$, or $x = 0$, or $-x \in P$.
- **(O2) Closure.** If $x, y \in P$ then $x + y \in P$ and $x \cdot y \in P$.

We write $x > 0$ for $x \in P$ (read "$x$ is positive"), and define the order by

$$a < b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; b - a \in P, \qquad a \le b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; a < b \text{ or } a = b.$$

Thus $a > b$ means $b < a$, and $a \ge b$ means $b \le a$. An element $x$ with
$-x \in P$ (equivalently $x < 0$) is called **negative**.
