# Wave 5 audit — A6 adversarial proof reading

You are a **read-only adversarial reader** (DeepSeek V4 Pro, max reasoning)
dispatched by the wave-5 audit Alpha of the prestige-math-library published-page
retro-audit (`AUDIT-WORKFLOW.md` step A6). You return **evidence, never edits**,
and you never propose to apply anything yourself. Alpha alone adjudicates.

> **NO SHELL-PERMISSION PROMPTS (owner, 2026-07-30) — binding on every current
> and future agent.** Never ask the owner to approve a command. You have no
> shell at all, so this is automatic for you; it is stated here because the rule
> binds every agent in this workflow verbatim.

**You have no tools and no filesystem.** Everything you are to read is in this
prompt: the item under review in full, and the Statement or Definition text of
every dependency it declares, quoted verbatim from disk. Do not speculate about
text you were not given — if a decision genuinely turns on something absent,
say so explicitly and name what is missing rather than assuming its content.

**Why you specifically.** The audit-side lineup is otherwise entirely Claude:
the Beta that read and retagged these items, the Alpha adjudicating them, and
the certifier reading repairs are all Claude models, and much of this legacy
corpus was Claude-authored too. **You are the only cross-family reader in the
loop.** A shared blind spot among the Claude readers will not show up as
disagreement among them; it can only show up as you finding something they did
not. Do not defer to the fact that a published item has already passed several
readings — this audit has repeatedly confirmed fatal defects in text that had.

**This is a retro-audit of ALREADY-PUBLISHED pages.** The item in front of you
was written, gated, judged and published months ago. Nothing about that history
is evidence that it is correct; it is the reason nobody has re-read it
adversarially since. Wave 3 measured 6 of its 11 confirmed fatal defects in
items the audit had left byte-identical.

## Your standard — the judges' standard

Read every proof step and every cited dependency as someone trying to REFUTE the
item. The point of this audit is to find what is actually wrong, not to confirm
the text reads well.

Mathematical accuracy, logical validity and correct citation of dependencies are NON-NEGOTIABLE: flag any false claim, any step not licensed by its cited facts, and any citation of an item for a claim it does not make. EXPLICITLY ACCEPTABLE, do not flag: minor citational quirks; logical gaps between proof steps that a competent reader closes within 30 SECONDS; other non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter. Library conventions that are NOT defects: sequences are functions on N and N CONTAINS 0, so indices start at 0; a natural number is a von Neumann natural (a set), so 1/k is written 1/iota(k) with iota the canonical natural of the field; the successor of a von Neumann natural n is sigma(n) = n union {n}, so n = {0,1,...,n-1} and sigma(n) = {0,1,...,n} has exactly n+1 elements; sigma(n) is NOT {0,...,n-1}, and an off-by-one objection that rests on reading it that way is a misreading of the library, not a defect; items cite by [L#] into a Facts and Assumptions block; a definition may discharge its own well-definedness inline or via justified_by. Also check the TITLE against what is actually proved: a title asserting more than the proof gives is a defect even when the Statement is correct. CITATION VOICE AND FIDELITY: every [F#], [A#], and [L#] fact must state the cited Definition or Statement itself, exactly when practical or in a concise version preserving its domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, conclusion, and direction.

## Triage — the standing rule, binding

- **Non-negotiable, always report:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity,
  correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort and do NOT report:** minor citational
  quirks; logical gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other
  non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter; prose style; page
  summary length; missing provenance URLs.

**Before alleging a cited dependency is too weak, quote the dependency text you
were given and show exactly what it fails to supply.** A refuter that asserts a
dependency is insufficient without quoting it is producing noise, and this
library's dominant real defect class — a citation of an item for a claim it does
not make — can only be established by that quotation.

**Read the Remarks with a numbered step's suspicion.** Measured across this
audit, Remark and Facts-block prose, not numbered steps, is where nearly every
confirmed fatal defect in this corpus has been found. A Remark that asserts how
some *other* item in the library uses this one is a frequent falsehood: you
cannot check those from here, so say so rather than passing them.

**Choice discipline matters in this wave.** Wave 5 is real analysis and general
topology: countability axioms, separation axioms, nets, filters, ultrafilters
and function spaces. Countable choice, dependent choice, the ultrafilter lemma
and full AC are genuinely different hypotheses here, and this library records
which one an argument spends. A proof that silently uses a choice principle its
Statement does not scope, or a Statement scoping a principle strictly stronger
or weaker than the proof actually needs, is a FATAL defect of the
missing-hypothesis class — not a quibble. Equally, the library has already
adopted AC, countable choice and dependent choice as foundational axioms, so
using one *within its declared scope* is not a defect.

## Output — the only thing you return

Plain markdown. For each finding, one block:

```
### FINDING 1, 2, 3, ... — FATAL or NONFATAL — location: title / Statement / [L#] / step X.Y / Remark
CLAIM AS WRITTEN: "<verbatim quote of the offending text>"
WHY IT FAILS: <the concrete false claim, unlicensed inference, missing
hypothesis, or inaccurate citation — with the verbatim dependency text that
does or does not license it>
WHAT WOULD FIX IT: <the smallest correction you can name, or "not obvious">
```

If, having genuinely tried to refute it, you find nothing fatal, say so plainly
and list what you checked. Finish with one line: `N fatal, M nonfatal`.

A confident empty reading is worse than useless here. Either name a concrete
defect with its quotation, or state clearly that you could not find one.

## Statement

**False claim:** every connected subset of $\mathbb R^n$ is polygonally connected.

The unit circle $S^1\subseteq\mathbb R^2$ is connected but is not polygonally connected.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The unit circle $S^1=\{u\in\mathbb R^2:\lVert u\rVert_2=1\}$ and the points $e_0,-e_0\in S^1$.

[A1] Every connected subset of Euclidean space is polygonally connected.

[L1] $S^1$ is path-connected and connected ([[cor-euclidean-spheres-are-path-connected]]).

[L2] A polygonal path is a finite concatenation of straight segments ([[def-polygonal-path-and-polygonal-connectedness]]).

[L3] If distinct unit vectors $u,v$ are joined by a segment, its midpoint has squared Euclidean norm $\lVert(u+v)/2\rVert_2^2=1-\lVert u-v\rVert_2^2/4<1$ ([[def-euclidean-inner-product]], [[def-norm-and-normed-space]]).

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose the claim [A1] holds. Since $S^1$ is connected by [L1], there is a polygonal path in $S^1$ from $e_0$ to $-e_0$. [A1, L1, assume-contra]

2.1 In its finite vertex list some adjacent vertices $u,v$ are distinct, since its endpoints are distinct. The straight segment from $u$ to $v$ lies in $S^1$ by [L2]. [L2, step 1.1]

3.1 But the midpoint of this segment has norm strictly less than $1$ by [L3], so it does not lie in $S^1$. This contradicts step 2.1. [L3, step 2.1, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## The dependencies it declares, quoted verbatim from disk

Each block below is the claim-bearing text of one declared dependency.
These are the only statements the item is entitled to use. If a step
needs more than the text below gives, that is the defect — quote the
dependency text and show exactly what it fails to supply.

### `cor-euclidean-spheres-are-path-connected` — corollary — For $n\\ge2$, the sphere $S^{n-1}$ is path-connected and connected

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

For $n\ge2$, the unit sphere $S^{n-1}\subseteq\mathbb R^n$ is path-connected and connected.

### `def-polygonal-path-and-polygonal-connectedness` — definition — Polygonal paths and polygonally connected subsets of $\\mathbb{R}^n$

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$. A **polygonal path in $A$** from $x$ to $y$ is a path $\gamma:[0,1]\to A$ ([[def-path-connected]], [[def-interval]]) for which there are a finite list of vertices $v_0,\ldots,v_m\in A$ and a partition $0=t_0<t_1<\cdots<t_m=1$ such that $v_0=x$, $v_m=y$, and

$$\gamma(t)=\frac{t_i-t}{t_i-t_{i-1}}v_{i-1}+\frac{t-t_{i-1}}{t_i-t_{i-1}}v_i\quad\text{when }t_{i-1}\le t\le t_i.$$

The formula uses only scalar multiplication and vector addition in $\mathbb{R}^n$ ([[def-vector-space]]). The finite list is indexed by a natural number ([[def-finite-cardinality]]).

The subset $A$ is **polygonally connected** when every pair of its points is joined by a polygonal path in $A$.

### `def-norm-and-normed-space` — definition — A norm on a real vector space, the induced metric, and the dictionary with the metric axioms

(statement provenance: untagged)

### Definition

Throughout this page $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) constructed in this library, in particular a
field, so that "vector space" below always means vector space over $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-vector-space]]).

Let $V$ be a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$, with zero vector $0_V$. A **norm on
$V$** is a function $N : V \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $u, v \in V$ and all
$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$:

- **(N1) Separation.** $N(v) = 0$ if and only if $v = 0_V$.
- **(N2) Absolute homogeneity.** $N(\lambda v) = |\lambda|\,N(v)$, the absolute
  value being that of [[def-abs-value]].
- **(N3) Triangle inequality.** $N(u + v) \le N(u) + N(v)$.

A **normed space** is a pair $(V, N)$ consisting of a vector space $V$ over
$\mathbb{R}$ and a norm $N$ on it. When only one norm is in play we write
$\lVert v\rVert$ for $N(v)$; when several are, the norm is always named.

**The values of a norm are real numbers.** The codomain is $\mathbb{R}$, so
$N(v)$ is an honest element of the complete ordered field and no infinite value
is permitted. This is the same convention [[rem-metric-axiom-conventions]]
records for metrics.

### Nonnegativity is a theorem, not an axiom

Many texts add a fourth condition $N(v) \ge 0$. It is redundant. Applying (N2)
with $\lambda = -1$ gives $N(-v) = |-1|\,N(v) = N(v)$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]],
[[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]] for $(-1)v = -v$), and then (N3)
with $u = v$ and $-v$ gives

$$0 \;=\; N(0_V) \;=\; N\bigl(v + (-v)\bigr) \;\le\; N(v) + N(-v) \;=\; N(v) + N(v),$$

where $N(0_V) = 0$ is (N1). So $N(v) + N(v) \ge 0$, and if $N(v) < 0$ then
$N(v) + N(v) < 0$ by addition of inequalities, which trichotomy forbids
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]). Hence $N(v) \ge 0$ for every $v \in V$.

**Consequently the verification of a candidate norm has three things to check and
not four**, exactly as the verification of a candidate metric has three and not
four ([[def-metric-space]], [[lem-metric-nonnegativity]]). No item in this
library assumes nonnegativity of a norm before the argument above.

### The induced metric

Let $N$ be a norm on $V$ and define

$$d_N(u,v) \;:=\; N(u - v) \qquad (u, v \in V),$$

where $u - v = u + (-v)$ ([[def-vector-space]]). **Then $d_N$ is a metric on
$V$** ([[def-metric-space]]), and the three axioms are the three conditions
above, in order:

- **(M1)** $d_N(u,v) = 0$ means $N(u-v) = 0$, which by (N1) says $u - v = 0_V$,
  that is $u = v$; and conversely $d_N(v,v) = N(0_V) = 0$.
- **(M2)** $d_N(v,u) = N(v-u) = N\bigl((-1)(u-v)\bigr) = |-1|\,N(u-v) = d_N(u,v)$,
  by (N2), [[lem-of-abs-value]] and $(-1)w = -w$
  ([[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]]).
- **(M3)** $d_N(u,w) = N\bigl((u-v) + (v-w)\bigr) \le N(u-v) + N(v-w) = d_N(u,v) + d_N(v,w)$,
  by (N3).

A normed space is therefore a metric space, and every notion defined for metric
spaces — open set ([[def-metric-topology]]), convergence, Cauchyness,
continuity, compactness — is available in it with no further definition. **This
library never introduces a second notion of any of them for normed spaces.**

### Two properties an arbitrary metric need not have

The metric $d_N$ satisfies, for all $u, v, w \in V$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$:

- **translation invariance**, $d_N(u + w, v + w) = N\bigl((u+w)-(v+w)\bigr) = N(u-v) = d_N(u,v)$;
- **absolute homogeneity**, $d_N(\lambda u, \lambda v) = N\bigl(\lambda(u-v)\bigr) = |\lambda|\,d_N(u,v)$, by (N2).

**Not every metric on a vector space arises from a norm**, and homogeneity is
what fails. The published bounded remetrisation [[lem-bounded-remetrisation]]
replaces a metric $d$ by $d' = \min\{d, 1\}$, a metric with the same topology
whose values never exceed $1$; on a vector space $V$ containing a vector $v$ with
$d(v, 0_V) > 0$ this $d'$ cannot be $d_M$ for any norm $M$, since absolute
homogeneity would force $d'(\lambda v, 0_V) = |\lambda|\,d'(v, 0_V)$, which is
unbounded in $\lambda$, while $d'$ is bounded by $1$. So the passage from norms
to metrics is not reversible, and a statement about a metric on a vector space is
strictly weaker than the corresponding statement about a norm.

### `def-euclidean-inner-product` — definition — The Euclidean inner product $\\langle x,y\\rangle = \\sum_{k<n} x_k y_k$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$

(statement provenance: untagged)

### Definition

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. A natural number is a von Neumann natural, that is a set,
and $n = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]],
[[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]), so

$$\mathbb{R}^{n} \;=\; \{\, x \;:\; x \text{ is a function } n \to \mathbb{R} \,\}$$

is the function space of [[def-function-space]] at $F = \mathbb{R}$ and $X = n$,
a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ under the pointwise operations
([[def-vector-space]]). We write $x_k := x(k)$ for $k < n$, and two elements of
$\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are equal exactly when they agree at every $k < n$. This is the
same set that [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] calls $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.

The **Euclidean inner product** of $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the real number

$$\langle x, y\rangle \;:=\; \sum_{k<n} x_k\,y_k ,$$

the finite sum of [[def-finite-sum]] applied to the list $k \mapsto x_k y_k$
(extended by $0$ beyond $n$, as every finite list in this library is). The
**Euclidean norm** of $x$ is

$$\lVert x\rVert_2 \;:=\; \sqrt{\langle x, x\rangle},$$

which is defined because $\langle x,x\rangle = \sum_{k<n} x_k^{2} \ge 0$ (a sum
of nonnegative terms, [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 4 and
[[lem-of-square-positive]], the case $x_k = 0$ giving $x_k^2 = 0$ by
[[def-integer-power]]) and every nonnegative real has a unique nonnegative square
root ([[thm-of-square-roots]]).

### Both are defined for every $n$, including $n = 0$

At $n = 0$ the set $\mathbb{R}^{0}$ has exactly one element, the empty function,
and it is the zero vector space ([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]] clause 5); the sum
above is the empty sum, so $\langle x,y\rangle = 0$ and $\lVert x\rVert_2 = 0$.
**This is the first place on this page where the two index regimes diverge, and
the divergence is deliberate.** The published metrics $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_\infty$ of
[[lem-metrics-on-rn]] are defined only for $n \ge 1$, because $d_\infty$ would
otherwise be a maximum over the empty index set; the algebra above needs no such
restriction. The boundary in this page runs between the algebra and the metric,
not where a reader would guess, and [[rem-rn-conventions-and-scope]] lists
exactly which items inherit $n \ge 1$.

### The algebra of the inner product

For all $x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$:

1. **Symmetry.** $\langle x,y\rangle = \langle y,x\rangle$, since $x_ky_k = y_kx_k$
   termwise.
2. **Additivity in the first argument.**
   $\langle x + y, z\rangle = \langle x,z\rangle + \langle y,z\rangle$: the list
   $k \mapsto (x_k+y_k)z_k$ is the termwise sum of $k \mapsto x_kz_k$ and
   $k \mapsto y_kz_k$, so [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 1 applies.
3. **Homogeneity in the first argument.**
   $\langle \lambda x, y\rangle = \lambda\langle x,y\rangle$, by
   [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 2.
4. **Bilinearity.** Clauses 2 and 3 together with symmetry give the same two laws
   in the second argument.
5. **Positive definiteness.** $\langle x,x\rangle \ge 0$, and
   $\langle x,x\rangle = 0$ if and only if $x = 0$. Indeed a vanishing sum of
   nonnegative terms has every term $0$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 4), so
   $x_k^{2} = 0$ for every $k < n$, and a nonzero real has a positive square
   ([[lem-of-square-positive]]), whence $x_k = 0$ for every $k < n$ and $x = 0$.
6. **Agreement with the published Euclidean metric.** For $n \ge 1$ and
   $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$,
   $\lVert x - y\rVert_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}(x_k-y_k)^{2}} = d_2(x,y)$, the two
   sides being the same expression ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]]). In particular
   $\lVert x\rVert_2 = d_2(x, 0)$.

That $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ is a norm in the sense of [[def-norm-and-normed-space]]
is proved in [[thm-cauchy-schwarz-and-the-euclidean-norm]], where the triangle
inequality is obtained from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality; it is not assumed
here.
