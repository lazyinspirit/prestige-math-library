# Wave 5 audit — A6 adversarial proof reading

You are a **read-only adversarial reader** (DeepSeek V4 Pro, max reasoning)
dispatched by the wave-5 audit Alpha of the prestige-math-library published-page
retro-audit (`AUDIT-WORKFLOW.md` step A6). You return **evidence, never edits**,
and you never propose to apply anything yourself. Alpha alone adjudicates.

> **NO SHELL-PERMISSION PROMPTS (owner, 2026-07-30) — binding on every current
> and future agent.** Never ask the owner to approve a command. You have no
> shell at all, so this is automatic for you; it is stated here because the rule
> binds every agent in this workflow verbatim.

**You have no tools and no filesystem.** Everything you are to read is in this
prompt: the item under review in full, and the Statement or Definition text of
every dependency it declares, quoted verbatim from disk. Do not speculate about
text you were not given — if a decision genuinely turns on something absent,
say so explicitly and name what is missing rather than assuming its content.

**Why you specifically.** The audit-side lineup is otherwise entirely Claude:
the Beta that read and retagged these items, the Alpha adjudicating them, and
the certifier reading repairs are all Claude models, and much of this legacy
corpus was Claude-authored too. **You are the only cross-family reader in the
loop.** A shared blind spot among the Claude readers will not show up as
disagreement among them; it can only show up as you finding something they did
not. Do not defer to the fact that a published item has already passed several
readings — this audit has repeatedly confirmed fatal defects in text that had.

**This is a retro-audit of ALREADY-PUBLISHED pages.** The item in front of you
was written, gated, judged and published months ago. Nothing about that history
is evidence that it is correct; it is the reason nobody has re-read it
adversarially since. Wave 3 measured 6 of its 11 confirmed fatal defects in
items the audit had left byte-identical.

## Your standard — the judges' standard

Read every proof step and every cited dependency as someone trying to REFUTE the
item. The point of this audit is to find what is actually wrong, not to confirm
the text reads well.

Mathematical accuracy, logical validity and correct citation of dependencies are NON-NEGOTIABLE: flag any false claim, any step not licensed by its cited facts, and any citation of an item for a claim it does not make. EXPLICITLY ACCEPTABLE, do not flag: minor citational quirks; logical gaps between proof steps that a competent reader closes within 30 SECONDS; other non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter. Library conventions that are NOT defects: sequences are functions on N and N CONTAINS 0, so indices start at 0; a natural number is a von Neumann natural (a set), so 1/k is written 1/iota(k) with iota the canonical natural of the field; the successor of a von Neumann natural n is sigma(n) = n union {n}, so n = {0,1,...,n-1} and sigma(n) = {0,1,...,n} has exactly n+1 elements; sigma(n) is NOT {0,...,n-1}, and an off-by-one objection that rests on reading it that way is a misreading of the library, not a defect; items cite by [L#] into a Facts and Assumptions block; a definition may discharge its own well-definedness inline or via justified_by. Also check the TITLE against what is actually proved: a title asserting more than the proof gives is a defect even when the Statement is correct. CITATION VOICE AND FIDELITY: every [F#], [A#], and [L#] fact must state the cited Definition or Statement itself, exactly when practical or in a concise version preserving its domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, conclusion, and direction.

## Triage — the standing rule, binding

- **Non-negotiable, always report:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity,
  correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort and do NOT report:** minor citational
  quirks; logical gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other
  non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter; prose style; page
  summary length; missing provenance URLs.

**Before alleging a cited dependency is too weak, quote the dependency text you
were given and show exactly what it fails to supply.** A refuter that asserts a
dependency is insufficient without quoting it is producing noise, and this
library's dominant real defect class — a citation of an item for a claim it does
not make — can only be established by that quotation.

**Read the Remarks with a numbered step's suspicion.** Measured across this
audit, Remark and Facts-block prose, not numbered steps, is where nearly every
confirmed fatal defect in this corpus has been found. A Remark that asserts how
some *other* item in the library uses this one is a frequent falsehood: you
cannot check those from here, so say so rather than passing them.

**Choice discipline matters in this wave.** Wave 5 is real analysis and general
topology: countability axioms, separation axioms, nets, filters, ultrafilters
and function spaces. Countable choice, dependent choice, the ultrafilter lemma
and full AC are genuinely different hypotheses here, and this library records
which one an argument spends. A proof that silently uses a choice principle its
Statement does not scope, or a Statement scoping a principle strictly stronger
or weaker than the proof actually needs, is a FATAL defect of the
missing-hypothesis class — not a quibble. Equally, the library has already
adopted AC, countable choice and dependent choice as foundational axioms, so
using one *within its declared scope* is not a defect.

## Output — the only thing you return

Plain markdown. For each finding, one block:

```
### FINDING 1, 2, 3, ... — FATAL or NONFATAL — location: title / Statement / [L#] / step X.Y / Remark
CLAIM AS WRITTEN: "<verbatim quote of the offending text>"
WHY IT FAILS: <the concrete false claim, unlicensed inference, missing
hypothesis, or inaccurate citation — with the verbatim dependency text that
does or does not license it>
WHAT WOULD FIX IT: <the smallest correction you can name, or "not obvious">
```

If, having genuinely tried to refute it, you find nothing fatal, say so plainly
and list what you checked. Finish with one line: `N fatal, M nonfatal`.

A confident empty reading is worse than useless here. Either name a concrete
defect with its quotation, or state clearly that you could not find one.

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ be a monotone sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]],
[[def-monotone-sequence]]). Then $(x_k)$ converges if and only if it is bounded,
that is if and only if there is $M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for every
$k \in \mathbb{N}$.

The forward implication holds for every sequence and is
[[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]]. What monotonicity buys is the converse, which
is false for sequences in general.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A monotone sequence $(x_k)$ of reals, with range $S = \{x_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$.

[L1] Monotone means nondecreasing or nonincreasing ([[def-monotone-sequence]]).

[L2] Monotone convergence: a nondecreasing sequence whose range is bounded above converges, to the supremum of its range; a nonincreasing sequence whose range is bounded below converges, to the infimum ([[thm-monotone-convergence]]).

[L3] Every convergent sequence of reals is bounded ([[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]]).

[L4] A sequence is bounded when some $M$ satisfies $|x_k| \le M$ for every $k$; its range is bounded above by $u$ when $x_k \le u$ for every $k$, and bounded below by $\ell$ when $\ell \le x_k$ for every $k$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L5] Absolute value: $|t| \le M$ exactly when $-M \le t \le M$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Suppose $(x_k)$ converges. Then it is bounded by [L3], and this direction uses neither the monotonicity hypothesis nor any case distinction. [given, L3]

1.2 Suppose instead that $(x_k)$ is bounded, and fix $M$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for every $k$; then $-M \le x_k \le M$ for every $k$, so the range $S$ is bounded above by $M$ and bounded below by $-M$. [given, L4, L5, assume-hyp]

2.1 If $(x_k)$ is nondecreasing then its range is bounded above by step 1.2, so $(x_k)$ converges, to $\sup S$. [step 1.2, L2, assume-case nondec]

2.2 If $(x_k)$ is nonincreasing then its range is bounded below by step 1.2, so $(x_k)$ converges, to $\inf S$. [step 1.2, L2, assume-case noninc]

3.1 A monotone sequence is nondecreasing or nonincreasing, so those two cases exhaust the hypothesis, and in both a bounded monotone sequence converges. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L1, cases: nondecreasing or nonincreasing, cases-exhaustive]

4.1 Both directions are established: a monotone sequence converges if and only if it is bounded. [step 1.1, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The limit is named, not merely asserted to exist.** In the nondecreasing case
  it is $\sup S$ and in the nonincreasing case $\inf S$, by
  [[thm-monotone-convergence]]. The equivalence is stated without the value only
  because the value depends on which of the two cases holds.

- **This is the form in which the result is used.** Bolzano-Weierstrass
  ([[thm-bolzano-weierstrass]]) extracts a monotone subsequence of a bounded
  sequence and then needs exactly this corollary, since what is available about
  the subsequence is boundedness, inherited from the sequence, and not a bound on
  a particular side.

- **Neither hypothesis can be dropped.** Without monotonicity the converse
  direction fails, by [[fs-bounded-implies-convergent]]. Without boundedness the
  forward direction is what fails, and it fails in the describable way recorded
  by [[lem-monotone-unbounded-diverges]]: a nondecreasing unbounded sequence
  diverges to $+\infty$.

## The dependencies it declares, quoted verbatim from disk

Each block below is the claim-bearing text of one declared dependency.
These are the only statements the item is entitled to use. If a step
needs more than the text below gives, that is the defect — quote the
dependency text and show exactly what it fails to supply.

### `thm-monotone-convergence` — theorem — A nondecreasing sequence bounded above converges to the supremum of its range, and a nonincreasing sequence bounded below to the infimum

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Statement

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]) and let
$S = \{x_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$ be its range.

1. If $(x_k)$ is nondecreasing ([[def-monotone-sequence]]) and $S$ is bounded
   above ([[def-bounded-set]]), then $(x_k)$ converges ([[def-real-limit]]) and
   $$\lim_{k} x_k = \sup S .$$
2. If $(x_k)$ is nonincreasing and $S$ is bounded below, then $(x_k)$ converges
   and $$\lim_{k} x_k = \inf S .$$

Both suprema and infima exist under the stated hypotheses: $S$ is nonempty, so
the least-upper-bound property ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) supplies the
first and [[thm-infimum-property]] the second, and each is unique
([[lem-sup-unique]]).

This is the first place in this track where the least-upper-bound property
produces a **limit**. Everything on the sequences page held in any Archimedean
ordered field; the theorem below does not, and the sequence of decimal
truncations of $\sqrt 2$ inside $\mathbb{Q}$ is the standard witness of its
failure there.

### `lem-convergent-implies-bounded` — lemma — Every convergent sequence is bounded

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Statement

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals converging to $x \in \mathbb{R}$
([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]). Then $(x_k)$ is bounded: there is
$M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

### `def-monotone-sequence` — definition — Nondecreasing, increasing, nonincreasing, decreasing, monotone, and eventually monotone sequences

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]), with $\mathbb{R}$ ordered
as in [[def-real-order]] and [[def-complete-ordered-field]], and with
$\mathbb{N}$ ordered as in [[def-nat-order]]. The sequence is:

- **nondecreasing** when $x_j \le x_k$ for all $j \le k$;
- **increasing** (or *strictly increasing*) when $x_j < x_k$ for all $j < k$;
- **nonincreasing** when $x_j \ge x_k$ for all $j \le k$;
- **decreasing** (or *strictly decreasing*) when $x_j > x_k$ for all $j < k$;
- **monotone** when it is nondecreasing or nonincreasing;
- **strictly monotone** when it is increasing or decreasing;
- **eventually monotone** when some tail $x^{(K)}$ ([[def-sequence]]) is
  monotone, that is when there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that the restriction of
  the comparison to indices $\ge K$ is one-signed.

An increasing sequence is nondecreasing and a decreasing sequence is
nonincreasing, since $j \le k$ means $j < k$ or $j = k$ and the second case gives
equality. A sequence that is both nondecreasing and nonincreasing is constant.

**Consecutive comparisons suffice, and that is an induction.** The four
conditions above quantify over *all* pairs of indices, but what one checks in
practice, and what a recursive construction delivers, is the comparison of
consecutive terms. The two agree:

> $(x_k)$ is nondecreasing **if and only if** $x_k \le x_{\sigma(k)}$ for every
> $k \in \mathbb{N}$, and $(x_k)$ is increasing **if and only if**
> $x_k < x_{\sigma(k)}$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$; likewise, with the
> inequalities reversed, for nonincreasing and decreasing.

The forward implications are the instances $j = k$, $k = \sigma(k)$ of the
definitions, using $k < \sigma(k)$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]). For the converse,
suppose $x_i \le x_{\sigma(i)}$ for every $i$ and fix $k$; we show by induction
on $k$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]) that $x_j \le x_k$ for every $j \le k$. For
$k = 0$: $j \le 0$ forces $j = 0$, and $x_0 \le x_0$. Assume the statement for
$k$ and let $j \le \sigma(k)$. If $j = \sigma(k)$ then $x_j \le x_{\sigma(k)}$ by
reflexivity. Otherwise $j < \sigma(k)$, and then $j \le k$: were $k < j$ we would
have $k < j < \sigma(k)$, which [[lem-nat-discrete]] excludes, so $j \le k$ by
totality of the order on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]). The induction
hypothesis gives $x_j \le x_k$, and $x_k \le x_{\sigma(k)}$ by assumption, so
$x_j \le x_{\sigma(k)}$ by transitivity. This completes the induction. The three
remaining equivalences are the same argument with $\le$ replaced by $<$,
$\ge$ or $>$, transitivity of the strict order being used in the same place.

**Boundedness of a monotone sequence is one-sided.** A nondecreasing sequence is
bounded below by its first term $x_0$, and a nonincreasing sequence is bounded
above by $x_0$, both immediately from the definition with $j = 0$. So for a
nondecreasing sequence the only substantive question is whether it is bounded
above, and for a nonincreasing sequence whether it is bounded below. The range of
$(x_k)$ is the set $\{x_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$ ([[def-sequence]]), and it is
bounded above, bounded below or bounded in the sense of [[def-bounded-set]]
exactly when the sequence is.

### `def-bounded-set` — definition — Lower bound, bounded below, bounded set

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ denotes the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a subset of it.

The notions **upper bound** and **bounded above** are already fixed by
[[def-complete-ordered-field]] and are only recalled here, never redefined:
$u \in \mathbb{R}$ is an *upper bound* of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$, and
$S$ is *bounded above* if it has at least one upper bound. The dual notions are:

- $\ell \in \mathbb{R}$ is a **lower bound** of $S$ if $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.
- $S$ is **bounded below** if it has at least one lower bound.
- $S$ is **bounded** if it is both bounded above and bounded below, that is, if
  there are $\ell, u \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\ell \le s \le u$ for every $s \in S$.

### `def-sequence` — definition — Sequences of reals: bounded, eventually, frequently, tails, subsequences

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]],
[[def-real-numbers]]) with its order and absolute value ([[def-real-order]]), and
$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers with its order ([[def-natural-numbers]],
[[def-nat-order]]).

A **sequence of reals** is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$. We write
$x_k$ for the value $x(k)$, call it the **$k$-th term**, and write $(x_k)$, or
$(x_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$, for the function itself. The **range** of $(x_k)$ is
the subset $\{\, x_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals and let $P$ be a property of indices.

- $(x_k)$ is **bounded** if there is $M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for
  every $k \in \mathbb{N}$; it is **unbounded** otherwise.
- $P$ holds **eventually** if there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $P(k)$ holds
  for every $k \ge K$.
- $P$ holds **frequently** if for every $K \in \mathbb{N}$ there is some
  $k \ge K$ for which $P(k)$ holds.
- For $K \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$K$-th tail** of $(x_k)$ is the sequence
  $x^{(K)}$ defined by $x^{(K)}_j := x_{j + K}$ for $j \in \mathbb{N}$; it is
  again a sequence of reals.
- A function $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is **strictly increasing** if
  $n_j < n_k$ whenever $j < k$. For such an $n$, the **subsequence** of $(x_k)$
  along $n$ is the composite $x \circ n$, written $(x_{n_k})_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$;
  it is again a sequence of reals.

**Convergence and Cauchyness are not defined here.** They are already fixed, for
sequences of reals, by the published [[def-real-limit]]: $(x_k)$ *converges* to
$x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is
$K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$, and $(x_k)$
is *Cauchy* when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$
with $|x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$. This page builds the
toolkit for those two notions and does not restate them. A sequence
**converges** if it converges to some real, and **diverges** if it does not.

### `lem-of-abs-value` — lemma — Basic properties of the absolute value

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$, with
$|x|$ the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]). Then

$$|x| \ge 0; \quad |x| = 0 \iff x = 0; \quad -|x| \le x \le |x|; \quad |-x| = |x|; \quad |xy| = |x|\,|y|;$$

and, for every $c > 0$, one has $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$.
