# Wave 5 audit — A6 adversarial proof reading

You are a **read-only adversarial reader** (DeepSeek V4 Pro, max reasoning)
dispatched by the wave-5 audit Alpha of the prestige-math-library published-page
retro-audit (`AUDIT-WORKFLOW.md` step A6). You return **evidence, never edits**,
and you never propose to apply anything yourself. Alpha alone adjudicates.

> **NO SHELL-PERMISSION PROMPTS (owner, 2026-07-30) — binding on every current
> and future agent.** Never ask the owner to approve a command. You have no
> shell at all, so this is automatic for you; it is stated here because the rule
> binds every agent in this workflow verbatim.

**You have no tools and no filesystem.** Everything you are to read is in this
prompt: the item under review in full, and the Statement or Definition text of
every dependency it declares, quoted verbatim from disk. Do not speculate about
text you were not given — if a decision genuinely turns on something absent,
say so explicitly and name what is missing rather than assuming its content.

**Why you specifically.** The audit-side lineup is otherwise entirely Claude:
the Beta that read and retagged these items, the Alpha adjudicating them, and
the certifier reading repairs are all Claude models, and much of this legacy
corpus was Claude-authored too. **You are the only cross-family reader in the
loop.** A shared blind spot among the Claude readers will not show up as
disagreement among them; it can only show up as you finding something they did
not. Do not defer to the fact that a published item has already passed several
readings — this audit has repeatedly confirmed fatal defects in text that had.

**This is a retro-audit of ALREADY-PUBLISHED pages.** The item in front of you
was written, gated, judged and published months ago. Nothing about that history
is evidence that it is correct; it is the reason nobody has re-read it
adversarially since. Wave 3 measured 6 of its 11 confirmed fatal defects in
items the audit had left byte-identical.

## Your standard — the judges' standard

Read every proof step and every cited dependency as someone trying to REFUTE the
item. The point of this audit is to find what is actually wrong, not to confirm
the text reads well.

Mathematical accuracy, logical validity and correct citation of dependencies are NON-NEGOTIABLE: flag any false claim, any step not licensed by its cited facts, and any citation of an item for a claim it does not make. EXPLICITLY ACCEPTABLE, do not flag: minor citational quirks; logical gaps between proof steps that a competent reader closes within 30 SECONDS; other non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter. Library conventions that are NOT defects: sequences are functions on N and N CONTAINS 0, so indices start at 0; a natural number is a von Neumann natural (a set), so 1/k is written 1/iota(k) with iota the canonical natural of the field; the successor of a von Neumann natural n is sigma(n) = n union {n}, so n = {0,1,...,n-1} and sigma(n) = {0,1,...,n} has exactly n+1 elements; sigma(n) is NOT {0,...,n-1}, and an off-by-one objection that rests on reading it that way is a misreading of the library, not a defect; items cite by [L#] into a Facts and Assumptions block; a definition may discharge its own well-definedness inline or via justified_by. Also check the TITLE against what is actually proved: a title asserting more than the proof gives is a defect even when the Statement is correct. CITATION VOICE AND FIDELITY: every [F#], [A#], and [L#] fact must state the cited Definition or Statement itself, exactly when practical or in a concise version preserving its domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, conclusion, and direction.

## Triage — the standing rule, binding

- **Non-negotiable, always report:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity,
  correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort and do NOT report:** minor citational
  quirks; logical gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other
  non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter; prose style; page
  summary length; missing provenance URLs.

**Before alleging a cited dependency is too weak, quote the dependency text you
were given and show exactly what it fails to supply.** A refuter that asserts a
dependency is insufficient without quoting it is producing noise, and this
library's dominant real defect class — a citation of an item for a claim it does
not make — can only be established by that quotation.

**Read the Remarks with a numbered step's suspicion.** Measured across this
audit, Remark and Facts-block prose, not numbered steps, is where nearly every
confirmed fatal defect in this corpus has been found. A Remark that asserts how
some *other* item in the library uses this one is a frequent falsehood: you
cannot check those from here, so say so rather than passing them.

**Choice discipline matters in this wave.** Wave 5 is real analysis and general
topology: countability axioms, separation axioms, nets, filters, ultrafilters
and function spaces. Countable choice, dependent choice, the ultrafilter lemma
and full AC are genuinely different hypotheses here, and this library records
which one an argument spends. A proof that silently uses a choice principle its
Statement does not scope, or a Statement scoping a principle strictly stronger
or weaker than the proof actually needs, is a FATAL defect of the
missing-hypothesis class — not a quibble. Equally, the library has already
adopted AC, countable choice and dependent choice as foundational axioms, so
using one *within its declared scope* is not a defect.

## Output — the only thing you return

Plain markdown. For each finding, one block:

```
### FINDING 1, 2, 3, ... — FATAL or NONFATAL — location: title / Statement / [L#] / step X.Y / Remark
CLAIM AS WRITTEN: "<verbatim quote of the offending text>"
WHY IT FAILS: <the concrete false claim, unlicensed inference, missing
hypothesis, or inaccurate citation — with the verbatim dependency text that
does or does not license it>
WHAT WOULD FIX IT: <the smallest correction you can name, or "not obvious">
```

If, having genuinely tried to refute it, you find nothing fatal, say so plainly
and list what you checked. Finish with one line: `N fatal, M nonfatal`.

A confident empty reading is worse than useless here. Either name a concrete
defect with its quotation, or state clearly that you could not find one.

## Statement

**False claim:** if every sequence in a topological space has at most one limit
([[def-sequence-convergence-top]]), then the space is Hausdorff
([[def-hausdorff-space]]).

The refutation is the **cocountable topology** $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{coc}}$ on
$\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-standard-topologies]]), whose open sets are $\varnothing$
together with the complements of the at most countable subsets of $\mathbb{R}$.
In it every convergent sequence is eventually constant, so limits are unique; and
no two nonempty open sets are disjoint, so the space is not Hausdorff. It is
nevertheless $T_1$.

**This is why [[def-sequence-convergence-top]] refuses the notation
$\lim_k x_k$ in a general space and restores it only under a hypothesis.**
Uniqueness of sequential limits is strictly weaker than the Hausdorff condition,
so it is uniqueness, and not the Hausdorff condition, that is the exact
licensing condition for the symbol — and the two are not interchangeable.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $\mathbb{R}$ with the cocountable topology $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{coc}}$, a sequence $(x_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $\mathbb{R}$, and points $p, q \in \mathbb{R}$.

[A1] $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{coc}}$ consists of $\varnothing$ together with the sets whose complement in $\mathbb{R}$ is at most countable; its closed sets are $\mathbb{R}$ and the at most countable sets ([[def-standard-topologies]]).

[A2] $x_k \to p$ means that for every neighbourhood $N$ of $p$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $x_k \in N$ for all $k \ge K$; an open set containing $p$ is such a neighbourhood ([[def-sequence-convergence-top]]).

[A3] A space is Hausdorff when distinct points have disjoint open neighbourhoods ([[def-hausdorff-space]], [[def-topological-space]]).

[L1] The range $\{\, x_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\}$ of a sequence is nonempty and at most countable, the sequence itself being a surjection of $\mathbb{N}$ onto it; and a subset of an at most countable set is at most countable ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]], [[lem-subset-of-countable]], [[def-countable]]).

[L2] A union of two at most countable sets is at most countable; this is the two-set instance of [[thm-countable-union-of-countable]], padded with copies of $\varnothing$, and it needs no choice principle, exactly as [[def-standard-topologies]] records for the cocountable topology itself.

[L3] $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable ([[thm-r-uncountable]]).

[L4] A topology is $T_1$ exactly when it contains the cofinite topology on the same set ([[thm-t1-iff-singletons-are-closed]], clause (d), [[def-t0-and-t1-spaces]]); a finite set is at most countable ([[def-countable]]).

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Suppose $x_k \to p$, and put $R := \{\, x_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\} \setminus \{p\}$, which is at most countable by [L1]. [A2, L1, assume-hyp]

1.2 Let $U, V \in \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{coc}}$ be nonempty and suppose $U \cap V = \varnothing$; then $\mathbb{R} = (\mathbb{R} \setminus U) \cup (\mathbb{R} \setminus V)$ is a union of two at most countable sets, hence at most countable by [L2], contradicting [L3]. [A1, L2, L3, assume-hyp]

1.3 The cofinite topology on $\mathbb{R}$ is contained in $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{coc}}$, a finite set being at most countable, so $(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{coc}})$ is $T_1$. [A1, L4]

2.1 Under step 1.1: $\mathbb{R} \setminus R$ is open by [A1] and contains $p$, so by [A2] there is $K$ with $x_k \in \mathbb{R} \setminus R$ for all $k \ge K$. [step 1.1, A1, A2]

2.2 So no two nonempty open sets of $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{coc}}$ are disjoint; taking $p = 0$ and $q = 1$, any open $U \ni p$ and $V \ni q$ are nonempty and therefore meet, and $(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{coc}})$ is not Hausdorff. [step 1.2, A3]

3.1 Under step 1.1: for $k \ge K$ the point $x_k$ lies in the range of the sequence and not in $R$, hence $x_k = p$; so the sequence is eventually constant with value $p$. [step 2.1]

4.1 If also $x_k \to q$ with $q \ne p$, then $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{p\}$ is open by [A1], since $\{p\}$ is at most countable, and it contains $q$; so by [A2] there is $K'$ with $x_k \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \{p\}$ for all $k \ge K'$, contradicting step 3.1 at any index at least $\max\{K, K'\}$. [step 3.1, A1, A2]

5.1 By step 4.1 every sequence in $(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{coc}})$ has at most one limit. [step 4.1]

6.1 By step 5.1 every sequence has at most one limit and by step 2.2 the space is not Hausdorff, so the claim is false; by step 1.3 the witness is moreover $T_1$. [step 5.1, step 2.2, step 1.3] ∎

## Remarks

- **The refutation is not about pathological sequences but about their scarcity.** In the cocountable topology on an uncountable set a sequence can only reach at most countably many points, and every at most countable set is closed, so convergence degenerates to eventual constancy. Sequences are simply too small to detect this topology, which is also why nothing about it can be read off from sequential arguments.

- **What a countability hypothesis would change is not settled here.** Whether adding first countability to the hypothesis rescues the claim is a question this library does not address, and nothing above asserts an answer. What *is* recorded is the metrizable case, where limits are unique and the space is Hausdorff for reasons independent of each other ([[def-sequence-convergence-top]], [[def-metrizable-space]]).

- **The converse is true and easy.** In a Hausdorff space limits are unique: two distinct limits would have disjoint open neighbourhoods, each of which contains the sequence eventually, which is impossible. That direction is not what this item refutes.

## The dependencies it declares, quoted verbatim from disk

These are the only statements the item is entitled to use. If a step
needs more than the text below gives, that is the defect — quote the
dependency text and show exactly what it fails to supply.

### `def-standard-topologies` — definition — The discrete, indiscrete, cofinite, cocountable, particular-point and Sierpinski topologies

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Throughout, a topology is as in [[def-topological-space]], and *finite*,
*at most countable* and *uncountable* are as in [[def-countable]], so that
"countable" always means "at most countable" and every finite set is countable.
Let $X$ be a set. The six families below are topologies on $X$; that each really
satisfies (T1), (T2) and (T3) is discharged in full after the list.

1. **Discrete topology.** $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{disc}} := \mathcal{P}(X)$: every
   subset is open, hence every subset is closed, hence every subset is clopen.
2. **Indiscrete topology.** $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{ind}} := \{\varnothing, X\}$.
   Its closed sets are again $\varnothing$ and $X$.
3. **Cofinite topology.**
   $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{cof}} := \{\varnothing\} \cup \{\, U \subseteq X : X \setminus U \text{ is finite} \,\}$.
   Its closed sets are $X$ together with the finite subsets of $X$.
4. **Cocountable topology.**
   $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{coc}} := \{\varnothing\} \cup \{\, U \subseteq X : X \setminus U \text{ is at most countable} \,\}$.
   Its closed sets are $X$ together with the at most countable subsets of $X$.
5. **Particular-point topology.** Fix $p \in X$ and put
   $\mathcal{T}_p := \{\varnothing\} \cup \{\, U \subseteq X : p \in U \,\}$: the
   open sets are $\varnothing$ and the sets containing $p$. Its closed sets are
   $X$ together with the sets **not** containing $p$.
6. **Sierpinski topology.** On a two-point set $S = \{a, b\}$ with $a \ne b$,
   $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{Sier}} := \{\varnothing, \{b\}, S\}$. The pair
   $(S, \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{Sier}})$ is **Sierpinski space**; $b$ is its open
   point and $a$ its closed point. This is exactly the particular-point topology
   of item 5 on a two-point set with particular point $b$, listed separately
   because it is quoted so often.

**Two elementary facts about finite sets are used below, and both are proved
here.**

*(i) A subset of a finite set is finite.* Let $F \approx n$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}$
([[def-equinumerous]], [[def-natural-numbers]]), witnessed by a bijection
$\varphi : F \to n$, and let $B \subseteq F$. Then $\varphi$ restricts to a
bijection of $B$ onto $\varphi[B] \subseteq n$
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]). Every element of the von Neumann natural
$n$ is a natural number strictly smaller than $n$
([[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]), so $\varphi[B]$ is a subset of $\mathbb{N}$
bounded above by $n$, hence finite by the sharper form of
[[lem-subset-of-countable]] ("a subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is finite if it is
bounded above"). Since $\approx$ is symmetric and transitive, $B$ is finite.

*(ii) A union of two finite sets is finite.* First, if $H$ is finite and $g$ is
any object then $H \cup \{g\}$ is finite: if $g \in H$ there is nothing to prove,
and otherwise a bijection $u : H \to k$ extends to a bijection
$H \cup \{g\} \to k \cup \{k\} = \sigma(k)$ by setting $u(g) := k$, which is
injective because $k \notin k$ ([[lem-nat-transitive-irreflexive]]). Now fix a
finite set $F$ and argue by induction ([[thm-induction-principle]]) on
$m \in \mathbb{N}$ over the statement "for every $G$ with $G \approx m$, the union
$F \cup G$ is finite". At $m = 0$ we have $G = \varnothing$ and $F \cup G = F$. At
$m = \sigma(j)$, a bijection $\psi : G \to \sigma(j)$ gives $g := \psi^{-1}(j)$
and $G' := G \setminus \{g\} \approx j$ (restrict $\psi$), so
$F \cup G = (F \cup G') \cup \{g\}$ is finite by the induction hypothesis and the
previous sentence.

**Discharge of the topology axioms.**

*Discrete.* Every subset of $X$ lies in $\mathcal{P}(X)$, so (T1), (T2) and (T3)
hold with nothing to check.

*Indiscrete.* (T1) is the definition. For (T2), a subfamily of
$\{\varnothing, X\}$ has union $\varnothing$ (if it is empty or $\{\varnothing\}$)
or $X$ (otherwise). For (T3), $\varnothing \cap A = \varnothing$ and
$X \cap X = X$.

*Cofinite.* (T1): $\varnothing$ is listed, and $X \setminus X = \varnothing$ is
finite. (T2): let $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{cof}}$. If every
member is $\varnothing$ the union is $\varnothing$. Otherwise fix
$U_0 \in \mathcal{S}$ with $U_0 \ne \varnothing$; then
$X \setminus \bigcup \mathcal{S} \subseteq X \setminus U_0$, which is finite, so
the left side is finite by (i). (T3): for nonempty $U, V$ with finite
complements, $X \setminus (U \cap V) = (X \setminus U) \cup (X \setminus V)$ is
finite by (ii); and if either of $U, V$ is empty so is $U \cap V$. The closed sets
are the complements of the open ones, that is $X = X \setminus \varnothing$
together with the finite sets.

*Cocountable.* Identical to the cofinite case with "at most countable" in place of
"finite": (i) is replaced by [[lem-subset-of-countable]] itself, and (ii) by the
statement that a union of two at most countable sets is at most countable, which
is the two-set instance of [[thm-countable-union-of-countable]] applied to the
family $A_0 := U, A_1 := V, A_k := \varnothing$ for $k \ge 2$.

*Particular point.* (T1): $\varnothing$ is listed and $p \in X$. (T2): a
subfamily whose members are all $\varnothing$ has union $\varnothing$; otherwise
some member contains $p$, hence so does the union. (T3): if $U$ and $V$ both
contain $p$ then so does $U \cap V$; and if either is $\varnothing$ then so is the
intersection.

*Sierpinski.* The special case $X = \{a,b\}$, $p = b$ of the previous paragraph:
the sets containing $b$ are $\{b\}$ and $S$, so
$\mathcal{T}_b = \{\varnothing, \{b\}, S\} = \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{Sier}}$.

### `def-sequence-convergence-top` — definition — Convergence and cluster points of a sequence in a topological space, sequential continuity, and the sequential closure

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]), with
neighbourhoods as in [[def-neighbourhood-top]].

A **sequence in $X$** is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to X$, written $(x_k)$ with
$x_k := x(k)$. As everywhere in this library $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
([[def-natural-numbers]]) and a sequence is indexed from $0$
([[def-sequence]]); an index range copied from a text that starts at $1$ must be
shifted before it is used here. The **range** of $(x_k)$ is
$\{\, x_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\}$. Following [[def-sequence]], a property of
indices holds **eventually** if it holds for all $k \ge K$ for some
$K \in \mathbb{N}$, and **frequently** if for every $K$ it holds for some
$k \ge K$; that vocabulary is used here for sequences in an arbitrary set.

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence in $X$ and let $p \in X$.

- $(x_k)$ **converges to $p$**, written $x_k \to p$, if for every neighbourhood
  $N$ of $p$ one has $x_k \in N$ eventually. The point $p$ is then called **a
  limit of $(x_k)$**.
- $p$ is a **cluster point** of $(x_k)$ if for every neighbourhood $N$ of $p$ one
  has $x_k \in N$ frequently.
- For $A \subseteq X$, the **sequential closure** of $A$ is
  $$\operatorname{seqcl}(A) := \{\, p \in X : x_k \to p \text{ for some sequence } (x_k) \text{ with } x_k \in A \text{ for all } k \,\} .$$
- A function $f : X \to Y$ into a topological space $Y$ is **sequentially
  continuous at $p$** if $x_k \to p$ in $X$ implies $f(x_k) \to f(p)$ in $Y$, and
  **sequentially continuous** if it is sequentially continuous at every point of
  $X$ ([[def-continuous-map-top]] for the ordinary notion).

**The notation $\lim_k x_k$ is not available at this generality, and the reason
is not fastidiousness.** In a general topological space a sequence may converge
to more than one point, so there is no function taking a convergent sequence to
"its" limit, and a symbol $\lim_k x_k$ would not denote. In the indiscrete
topology on a set with at least two points the only neighbourhood of any point is
$X$, so **every** sequence converges to **every** point; in the cofinite topology
on an infinite set every injective sequence converges to every point. Both
witnesses are on the companion page. Accordingly this library writes "$p$ is *a*
limit of $(x_k)$" and "$(x_k)$ converges to $p$", never "*the* limit" and never
$\lim_k x_k$, for a sequence in a space that has not been given a hypothesis
restoring uniqueness.

**Where the notation becomes legitimate again.** Uniqueness of limits is what
licenses the symbol, exactly as it does for sequences of reals
([[lem-limit-unique]]) and in a metric space ([[lem-metric-limits-unique]]): in a
metric space a sequence has at most one limit and $\lim_k x_k$ is unambiguous.
Every metrizable space therefore admits the notation, and so does every space in
which distinct points have disjoint neighbourhoods; where this page uses a
metrizable space, and only there, the usual notation is used without further
comment. The general reading of "$x_k \to p$" above never presupposes it.

**Convergence agrees with the metric notion on a metric topology.** For a metric
space the balls around $p$ are a neighbourhood base at $p$
([[lem-metric-ball-neighbourhood-base]]), so "eventually in every neighbourhood
of $p$" and "eventually in every ball around $p$" are the same condition, and the
latter is [[def-metric-convergence]]. The identification is carried out where
metrizable spaces are defined, later on this page.

### `def-hausdorff-space` — definition — Hausdorff space: distinct points have disjoint open neighbourhoods; every metrizable space is Hausdorff and the indiscrete topology on two points is not

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ ([[def-topological-space]]) is
**Hausdorff** when any two distinct points are separated by disjoint open sets:
for all $x, y \in X$ with $x \ne y$ there are $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$ with

$$x \in U, \qquad y \in V, \qquad U \cap V = \varnothing .$$

Since an open set containing a point is an open neighbourhood of it
([[def-neighbourhood-top]]), the condition reads: distinct points have disjoint
open neighbourhoods. Nothing is asserted about points that are equal, and the
condition is vacuous for a space with at most one point, so every such space is
Hausdorff.

**Every metrizable space is Hausdorff.** This is not proved here, because it is
already discharged: [[def-metrizable-space]] records it among the two things
every metrizable space has, deriving it from
[[thm-metric-hausdorff-separation]], which separates $p \ne q$ in a metric space
by the disjoint open balls $B(p,r)$ and $B(q,r)$ with $r = d(p,q)/2 > 0$. In
particular $\mathbb{R}$ with its usual topology, every $\mathbb{R}^n$, and every
subspace of a metrizable space are Hausdorff.

**Not every space is Hausdorff.** The indiscrete topology
$\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{ind}} = \{\varnothing, X\}$ on a set $X = \{a,b\}$ with
$a \ne b$ ([[def-standard-topologies]]) is not: the only open set containing $a$
is $X$, the only one containing $b$ is $X$, and $X \cap X = X \ne \varnothing$.
This is the same two-point space that [[def-metrizable-space]] uses to exhibit a
topology induced by no metric, and the reason is the same one: failure of the
Hausdorff condition is an obstruction to metrizability.

**Being Hausdorff is a topological property** ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]).
If $h : X \to Z$ is a homeomorphism and $X$ is Hausdorff, then for $z \ne z'$ in
$Z$ the points $h^{-1}(z)$ and $h^{-1}(z')$ are distinct, so they have disjoint
open $U, V$; the images $h[U]$ and $h[V]$ are open, disjoint, and contain $z$ and
$z'$ respectively, a homeomorphism carrying the open sets of one space
bijectively onto those of the other. So no space homeomorphic to a Hausdorff
space fails the condition.

**Scope of this item.** Only the definition, the metrizable case and the
two-point failure are recorded here, because that is all this page uses. The
Hausdorff condition is one of a graded family of separation axioms; that family,
its ordering, and the questions of which of its members are hereditary or
preserved by products, are not available at this point in the reading order and
nothing here anticipates them. What this page does use is a single negative
result: a quotient of a Hausdorff space need not be Hausdorff, which is recorded
below as a false statement and witnessed on the companion page.

### `def-t0-and-t1-spaces` — definition — $T_0$ (Kolmogorov) and $T_1$ (Frechet) spaces

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]).

- $X$ is **$T_0$**, or a **Kolmogorov space**, when any two distinct points are
  *topologically distinguishable*: for all $x, y \in X$ with $x \ne y$ there is
  an open set containing exactly one of $x$ and $y$.
- $X$ is **$T_1$**, or a **Frechet space**, when each of any two distinct points
  has an open set containing it and missing the other: for all $x, y \in X$ with
  $x \ne y$ there are $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$ with

$$x \in U, \quad y \notin U, \qquad y \in V, \quad x \notin V .$$

Nothing is asserted about a pair of equal points, so a space with at most one
point satisfies both conditions vacuously.

Since an open set containing a point is an open neighbourhood of it
([[def-neighbourhood-top]]), both conditions may be read with "open
neighbourhood" in place of "open set"; and by the same equivalence recorded in
[[def-neighbourhood-top]] they may be read with arbitrary neighbourhoods, since
a neighbourhood of $x$ contains an open one and an open neighbourhood is a
neighbourhood.

**Every $T_1$ space is $T_0$, and this is discharged here** rather than left to
the reader, because it is the bottom arrow of the whole hierarchy on this page.
Let $x \ne y$ and take $U, V$ as in the $T_1$ condition. Then $U$ is an open set
containing $x$ and not $y$, so it contains exactly one of the two points, which
is the $T_0$ condition. Only the first half of the $T_1$ condition is used, so
the implication does not reverse formally, and it does not reverse in fact:
Sierpinski space is a witness, recorded on the companion page.

**The two conditions differ exactly in symmetry.** $T_0$ asks for *one* open set
that tells the pair apart, with no control over which of the two it contains;
$T_1$ asks for *both* separations at once. In Sierpinski space
$(\{a,b\}, \{\varnothing, \{b\}, \{a,b\}\})$ of [[def-standard-topologies]] the
open set $\{b\}$ contains $b$ and not $a$, so the space is $T_0$; but the only
open set containing $a$ is the whole space, which also contains $b$, so it is
not $T_1$.

**Neither condition is a property of a set alone.** Both are properties of the
pair $(X, \mathcal{T})$, and both are inherited upwards along the comparison
order of [[def-topological-space]]: if $\mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2$
and $(X,\mathcal{T}_1)$ is $T_0$, respectively $T_1$, then so is
$(X,\mathcal{T}_2)$, since the separating open sets of the coarser topology lie
in the finer one. In particular the discrete topology satisfies both, and the
indiscrete topology on a set with at least two points satisfies neither.

### `thm-t1-iff-singletons-are-closed` — theorem — A space is $T_1$ if and only if every singleton is closed, if and only if every finite subset is closed, if and only if its topology contains the cofinite topology

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Statement

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]) and let
$\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{cof}}$ be the cofinite topology on the set $X$
([[def-standard-topologies]]). The following four conditions are equivalent.

- **(a)** $X$ is $T_1$ ([[def-t0-and-t1-spaces]]).
- **(b)** $\{x\}$ is closed for every $x \in X$.
- **(c)** $F$ is closed for every finite $F \subseteq X$ ([[def-countable]]).
- **(d)** $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{cof}} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$, that is, the
  topology of $X$ is finer than the cofinite topology on the same set.

Condition (d) says that the cofinite topology is the **coarsest** $T_1$ topology
on any set: it is $T_1$ by the equivalence, and every $T_1$ topology on that set
contains it.

### `def-countable` — definition — Finite, countably infinite, countable, uncountable

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Recall that a natural number is a von Neumann natural
([[def-natural-numbers]]): $0 = \varnothing$ and $\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$, so
that

$$n = \{\, m \in \mathbb{N} : m < n \,\} = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$$

is itself the set of its predecessors. Here $<$ is the order of
[[def-nat-order]], which is defined additively, so the displayed identity is a
theorem and not a convention: it is [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]], proved
immediately above. Let $A$ be a set, and let $\approx$ be equinumerosity
([[def-equinumerous]]).

- $A$ is **finite** if $A \approx n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
- $A$ is **countably infinite** if $A \approx \mathbb{N}$.
- $A$ is **at most countable** if it is finite or countably infinite.
- $A$ is **uncountable** if it is not at most countable.

### `lem-subset-of-countable` — lemma — Every subset of an at most countable set is at most countable

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $A$ be at most countable ([[def-countable]]) and let $B \subseteq A$. Then
$B$ is at most countable.

The proof establishes the sharper statement about subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ from
which this follows: **a subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is finite if it is
bounded above, and countably infinite if it is not.**

**No choice principle is used.** This is the point of the lemma rather than a
footnote to it. The enumeration of an unbounded $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is built
by always taking the *least* element of $S$ above the previous one, and the least
element of a nonempty set of naturals is canonical
([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]): it is determined by $S$, not selected from it.
Replacing "least" by "some" would turn the construction into an appeal to
dependent choice.

### `lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n` — lemma — A nonempty set is at most countable iff it is a surjective image of $\\mathbb{N}$

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $A$ be a nonempty set. Then $A$ is at most countable ([[def-countable]]) if
and only if there is a surjection $s : \mathbb{N} \to A$
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

Moreover, from any such surjection an injection $A \to \mathbb{N}$ is obtained
explicitly, without any choice, by

$$j(a) := \min\{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : s(k) = a \,\}.$$

This is the working form of countability used everywhere below: to prove a
nonempty set countable it suffices to list its elements, repetitions and all.

**No choice principle is used.** The backward direction is where an appeal to
choice would be natural ("for each $a$ pick some $k$ with $s(k) = a$") and it is
avoided outright, because $\min$ is canonical: every nonempty set of naturals has
a *least* element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]), so $j(a)$ is determined by
$a$ and $s$ alone.

### `thm-r-uncountable` — theorem — $\\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable (Cantor's nested intervals, 1874)

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $\mathbb{R}$ be a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).
Then $\mathbb{R}$ is **uncountable** ([[def-countable]]): there is no surjection
$\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, so $\mathbb{R}$ is neither finite nor countably
infinite.

The proof is Cantor's original argument of 1874, not the decimal diagonal.
Assuming a surjection $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, one builds nested closed
intervals $[a_n, b_n]$ with $a_n < b_n$ and $f(n) \notin [a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}]$, and
then $\sup\{a_n\}$ is a real number that $f$ misses. **The decimal diagonal is
deliberately avoided**: decimal expansions are infinite series, which this
library has not yet constructed, so a diagonal proof here would rest on machinery
that does not exist. The diagonal argument survives in its non-circular form, on
power sets, as Cantor's theorem earlier on this page; see the remarks below.

**The construction uses no choice, and that is what the thirds are for.** Given
$[a_n, b_n]$ of length $d$, its three closed thirds
$[a_n, a_n + d/3]$, $[a_n + d/3, a_n + 2d/3]$, $[a_n + 2d/3, b_n]$ cannot all
contain $f(n)$, because the first and the third are disjoint; the rule takes the
**first one in that fixed order** which does not contain $f(n)$. That is a
definition by cases, so the whole construction is a single application of the
recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) to one explicitly given function. A version
of the argument that says "pick a third avoiding $f(n)$" would be using dependent
choice, silently and unnecessarily.

### `thm-countable-union-of-countable` — theorem — Countable unions of at most countable sets, assuming $\\mathrm{AC}_\\omega$

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

**Assume the Axiom of Countable Choice** ([[def-countable-choice]]). Let
$(A_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a family of at most countable sets
([[def-countable]]) indexed by $\mathbb{N}$. Then

$$U = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n$$

is at most countable.

**The hypothesis $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ is not decoration and it is not removable.**
It is spent at exactly one step, step 3.1 below, where one surjection
$\mathbb{N} \to A_n$ is selected for every $n$ at once. Each $A_n$ has such
surjections, in general many of them, and the countability assumption provides no
rule for singling one out. Without some choice principle the theorem is not
available at all: ZF alone does not prove it, **conditionally on the consistency
of ZF**, as recorded among this page's false statements and discussed in the
remarks below, where that item is named and linked. The
consistency hypothesis is not a formality and cannot be dropped: the separation
rests on an external independence result that this library quotes rather than
proves, and it cannot be stated without it.

### `def-topological-space` — definition — Topology on a set, open and closed sets, clopen sets, the closed-set axiomatisation, and the coarser/finer comparison

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $X$ be a set and write $\mathcal{P}(X)$ for its power set. A **topology** on
$X$ is a family $\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ such that

- **(T1)** $\varnothing \in \mathcal{T}$ and $X \in \mathcal{T}$;
- **(T2)** $\bigcup \mathcal{S} \in \mathcal{T}$ for every $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$;
- **(T3)** $U \cap V \in \mathcal{T}$ for all $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$.

A **topological space** is a pair $(X, \mathcal{T})$ consisting of a set $X$ and
a topology $\mathcal{T}$ on it; the elements of $X$ are its **points**. When only
one topology is in play we write $X$ for the pair; when several are, the topology
is always named.

The members of $\mathcal{T}$ are the **open** sets of $(X,\mathcal{T})$. A subset
$F \subseteq X$ is **closed** when its complement $X \setminus F$ is open, and
**clopen** when it is both open and closed. By (T1) both $\varnothing$ and $X$
are clopen. *Open and closed are not opposites*: a set may be neither, and it may
be both, so "not open" is never a synonym for "closed".

**Finite intersections, and the empty one.** Axiom (T3) is stated for two sets
because that is all that is ever needed: if $n \ge 1$ and
$U_1, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{T}$, then $U_1 \cap \dots \cap U_n \in \mathcal{T}$
follows by iterating (T3) $n-1$ times. The intersection of the **empty** family
of subsets of $X$ is $X$, since the condition "lies in every member of the empty
family" is vacuous; that case is covered by (T1) rather than by (T3), which is
one of the two reasons $X \in \mathcal{T}$ is demanded outright. The other is
that (T2) alone gives only $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$.

**The closed sets, and the dual axiomatisation.** Put
$\mathcal{C} := \{\, X \setminus U : U \in \mathcal{T} \,\}$, the family of closed
sets. Then

- **(C1)** $\varnothing \in \mathcal{C}$ and $X \in \mathcal{C}$;
- **(C2)** $\bigcap \mathcal{D} \in \mathcal{C}$ for every **nonempty**
  $\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$;
- **(C3)** $C \cup D \in \mathcal{C}$ for all $C, D \in \mathcal{C}$.

Conversely, if a family $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ satisfies (C1),
(C2) and (C3), then $\mathcal{T} := \{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{C} \,\}$
is a topology on $X$ whose closed sets are exactly the members of $\mathcal{C}$.
So a topology may be presented equally well by its open sets or by its closed
sets, and this library uses whichever is shorter.

*Both directions are one computation, and it is carried out here rather than
assumed.* The map $U \mapsto X \setminus U$ is an involution of
$\mathcal{P}(X)$, hence a bijection, and it carries the two De Morgan identities

$$X \setminus \bigcup_{i \in I} A_i = \bigcap_{i \in I} (X \setminus A_i) \quad (I \ne \varnothing), \qquad X \setminus \bigcap_{i \in I} A_i = \bigcup_{i \in I} (X \setminus A_i) \quad (I \ne \varnothing)$$

term by term into each other. Given (T1)–(T3): $\varnothing = X \setminus X$ and
$X = X \setminus \varnothing$ lie in $\mathcal{C}$, which is (C1); for nonempty
$\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$ the family
$\mathcal{S} = \{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{D} \,\}$ lies in $\mathcal{T}$
and $\bigcap \mathcal{D} = X \setminus \bigcup \mathcal{S}$ is closed by (T2),
which is (C2); and $C \cup D = X \setminus ((X \setminus C) \cap (X \setminus D))$
is closed by (T3), which is (C3). Given (C1)–(C3) the same three lines run
backwards, the empty-union case $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$ being supplied
by (C1) rather than by (C2); and $\{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{C} \,\}$ has
$\mathcal{C}$ as its family of complements because complementation is an
involution.

**Comparison of topologies.** If $\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ are
topologies on the same set $X$ and $\mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2$, then
$\mathcal{T}_1$ is **coarser** than $\mathcal{T}_2$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ is
**finer** than $\mathcal{T}_1$; the comparison is **strict** when the inclusion
is. Inclusion is a partial order on the set of topologies on $X$
([[def-partial-order]]), and it is not a total one: two topologies on the same
set may be incomparable.

### `def-metrizable-space` — definition — Metrizable space: a topological space whose topology is induced by some metric; metrizability is topological, the metric is not

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ ([[def-topological-space]]) is
**metrizable** if there is a metric $d$ on $X$ ([[def-metric-space]]) whose
metric topology is $\mathcal{T}$, that is $\mathcal{T} = \mathcal{T}_d$
([[def-metric-topology]]). Such a $d$ is said to **induce** or **metrise**
$\mathcal{T}$.

**The definition presupposes that $\mathcal{T}_d$ is a topology in the sense of
[[def-topological-space]], and it is.** By [[def-metric-topology]] both
$\varnothing$ and $X$ are open in $(X,d)$, which is (T1), and by
[[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]] the family $\mathcal{T}_d$ is closed under
arbitrary unions, which is (T2), and under intersections of $n \ge 1$ members,
which contains (T3). So every metric space is a topological space, and the
metric-space development of this library is a special case of the present one.

**The standard local notions in the two developments agree after translating
their neighbourhood conventions.** Let $d$ be a metric on $X$ and give $X$ the
topology $\mathcal{T}_d$.

- *Neighbourhoods and balls.* [[def-metric-topology]] uses "neighbourhood" for
  an open set containing $x$, whereas [[def-neighbourhood-top]] also allows a
  non-open superset of such a set. Thus the two collections are not literally
  equal, but the open metric neighbourhoods are cofinal in the broader
  neighbourhood filter. The balls $B(x,r)$, $r > 0$ ([[def-metric-ball]]), are
  open ([[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]]) and form a neighbourhood base at $x$:
  any neighbourhood $N$ contains an open $U \ni x$, hence a ball around $x$ by
  [[def-metric-topology]]. The balls of radius $1/n$ alone already suffice
  ([[lem-metric-ball-neighbourhood-base]]).
- *Interior, closure, boundary.* [[def-metric-interior-closure-boundary]] defines
  them by the same conditions with balls in place of neighbourhoods, and the
  previous bullet makes the two conditions equivalent; the metric closure is the
  smallest closed superset ([[thm-metric-closure-characterisation]]), which is the
  definition used here ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]). So the two
  closures, the two interiors and the two boundaries are the same three
  operations.
- *Convergence.* $x_k \to p$ in the sense of [[def-sequence-convergence-top]] is
  "eventually in every neighbourhood of $p$", and by the first bullet this is
  "eventually in every ball around $p$", which is [[def-metric-convergence]].
- *Continuity.* $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ continuity at $a$
  ([[def-metric-continuity]]) says that every ball around $f(a)$ has a ball
  around $a$ mapped into it, which by the first bullet is continuity at $a$ in
  the sense of [[def-continuous-map-top]].

- *Subspaces.* For $A \subseteq X$ the subspace topology
  $\{\, U \cap A : U \in \mathcal{T}_d \,\}$ of [[def-subspace-topology-top]] is
  exactly the metric topology of the subspace metric $d_A$
  ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]), so the two uses of the phrase
  *subspace topology* in this library name one thing. Indeed
  $B_A(a,r) = B_X(a,r) \cap A$: a trace $U \cap A$ is $d_A$-open, since each of
  its points $a$ has $B_X(a,r) \subseteq U$ and hence $B_A(a,r) \subseteq U \cap A$;
  and a $d_A$-open $W$ is the trace of
  $U := \bigcup \{\, B_X(a,r) : a \in W,\ r > 0,\ B_X(a,r) \cap A \subseteq W \,\}$,
  which is $d_X$-open, satisfies $U \cap A = W$, and involves no choice principle,
  the union being taken over a set of pairs rather than over a selection.

Consequently the metric-space notions of interior, closure, boundary, density,
convergence, continuity and subspace agree with the topological notions here,
and statements about them transfer once a metric is named. For neighbourhoods
the transfer uses the explicit convention change above: a metric-page
neighbourhood is an open topological neighbourhood, while every topological
neighbourhood contains one.

**Metrizability is a topological property; the metric is not part of it.** If
$h : X \to Y$ is a homeomorphism ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]) and $d$
metrises $X$, then $d'(y_1,y_2) := d(h^{-1}(y_1), h^{-1}(y_2))$ is a metric on
$Y$ — the three axioms transfer along the bijection $h^{-1}$ — and
$h[B_d(x,r)] = B_{d'}(h(x), r)$, so $h$ carries a basis of $\mathcal{T}_d$ to a
basis of $\mathcal{T}_{d'}$ and $\mathcal{T}_{d'} = h[\mathcal{T}_d] = \mathcal{T}_Y$.
Hence $Y$ is metrizable. The metric itself, however, is **not** determined by the
topology: two metrics on one set may induce the same topology without agreeing,
which is exactly topological equivalence ([[def-equivalent-metrics]]), and
properties of a metric that are not properties of its topology, boundedness among
them, are therefore not properties of a metrizable space.

**Two things every metrizable space has.** It is **Hausdorff**: distinct points
have disjoint open neighbourhoods, by [[thm-metric-hausdorff-separation]] applied
to any metric inducing the topology. And it is **first countable**
([[def-first-countable-top]]), by [[lem-metric-ball-neighbourhood-base]]. Either
failure is therefore an obstruction to metrizability, and this page uses the
first of them to exhibit a topology induced by no metric.

**Sequential limits in a metrizable space are unique, so the notation
$\lim_k x_k$ is available there.** In a metric space a sequence has at most one
limit ([[lem-metric-limits-unique]]), and by the agreement of convergence above
that uniqueness is a statement about the topology alone; so within a metrizable
space, and only there, this page writes $\lim_k x_k$ in the ordinary way. In a
general space the symbol is unavailable ([[def-sequence-convergence-top]]).

**The usual topology of $\mathbb{R}$.** The absolute value makes $\mathbb{R}$ a
metric space under $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) = |x-y|$, its open balls are the bounded
open intervals, and the resulting metric topology is what claim 3 of
[[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]] names the **usual topology** of $\mathbb{R}$.
That is the topology meant by the phrase throughout these two pages, and
$\mathbb{R}$ carrying it is metrizable by definition. Every statement about it on
these two pages is proved from the metric $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ and the bridge above,
and no example re-derives any of it.
