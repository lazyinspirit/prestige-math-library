# Wave 5 audit — A6 adversarial proof reading

You are a **read-only adversarial reader** (DeepSeek V4 Pro, max reasoning)
dispatched by the wave-5 audit Alpha of the prestige-math-library published-page
retro-audit (`AUDIT-WORKFLOW.md` step A6). You return **evidence, never edits**,
and you never propose to apply anything yourself. Alpha alone adjudicates.

> **NO SHELL-PERMISSION PROMPTS (owner, 2026-07-30) — binding on every current
> and future agent.** Never ask the owner to approve a command. You have no
> shell at all, so this is automatic for you; it is stated here because the rule
> binds every agent in this workflow verbatim.

**You have no tools and no filesystem.** Everything you are to read is in this
prompt: the item under review in full, and the Statement or Definition text of
every dependency it declares, quoted verbatim from disk. Do not speculate about
text you were not given — if a decision genuinely turns on something absent,
say so explicitly and name what is missing rather than assuming its content.

**Why you specifically.** The audit-side lineup is otherwise entirely Claude:
the Beta that read and retagged these items, the Alpha adjudicating them, and
the certifier reading repairs are all Claude models, and much of this legacy
corpus was Claude-authored too. **You are the only cross-family reader in the
loop.** A shared blind spot among the Claude readers will not show up as
disagreement among them; it can only show up as you finding something they did
not. Do not defer to the fact that a published item has already passed several
readings — this audit has repeatedly confirmed fatal defects in text that had.

**This is a retro-audit of ALREADY-PUBLISHED pages.** The item in front of you
was written, gated, judged and published months ago. Nothing about that history
is evidence that it is correct; it is the reason nobody has re-read it
adversarially since. Wave 3 measured 6 of its 11 confirmed fatal defects in
items the audit had left byte-identical.

## Your standard — the judges' standard

Read every proof step and every cited dependency as someone trying to REFUTE the
item. The point of this audit is to find what is actually wrong, not to confirm
the text reads well.

Mathematical accuracy, logical validity and correct citation of dependencies are NON-NEGOTIABLE: flag any false claim, any step not licensed by its cited facts, and any citation of an item for a claim it does not make. EXPLICITLY ACCEPTABLE, do not flag: minor citational quirks; logical gaps between proof steps that a competent reader closes within 30 SECONDS; other non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter. Library conventions that are NOT defects: sequences are functions on N and N CONTAINS 0, so indices start at 0; a natural number is a von Neumann natural (a set), so 1/k is written 1/iota(k) with iota the canonical natural of the field; the successor of a von Neumann natural n is sigma(n) = n union {n}, so n = {0,1,...,n-1} and sigma(n) = {0,1,...,n} has exactly n+1 elements; sigma(n) is NOT {0,...,n-1}, and an off-by-one objection that rests on reading it that way is a misreading of the library, not a defect; items cite by [L#] into a Facts and Assumptions block; a definition may discharge its own well-definedness inline or via justified_by. Also check the TITLE against what is actually proved: a title asserting more than the proof gives is a defect even when the Statement is correct. CITATION VOICE AND FIDELITY: every [F#], [A#], and [L#] fact must state the cited Definition or Statement itself, exactly when practical or in a concise version preserving its domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, conclusion, and direction.

## Triage — the standing rule, binding

- **Non-negotiable, always report:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity,
  correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort and do NOT report:** minor citational
  quirks; logical gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other
  non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter; prose style; page
  summary length; missing provenance URLs.

**Before alleging a cited dependency is too weak, quote the dependency text you
were given and show exactly what it fails to supply.** A refuter that asserts a
dependency is insufficient without quoting it is producing noise, and this
library's dominant real defect class — a citation of an item for a claim it does
not make — can only be established by that quotation.

**Read the Remarks with a numbered step's suspicion.** Measured across this
audit, Remark and Facts-block prose, not numbered steps, is where nearly every
confirmed fatal defect in this corpus has been found. A Remark that asserts how
some *other* item in the library uses this one is a frequent falsehood: you
cannot check those from here, so say so rather than passing them.

**Choice discipline matters in this wave.** Wave 5 is real analysis and general
topology: countability axioms, separation axioms, nets, filters, ultrafilters
and function spaces. Countable choice, dependent choice, the ultrafilter lemma
and full AC are genuinely different hypotheses here, and this library records
which one an argument spends. A proof that silently uses a choice principle its
Statement does not scope, or a Statement scoping a principle strictly stronger
or weaker than the proof actually needs, is a FATAL defect of the
missing-hypothesis class — not a quibble. Equally, the library has already
adopted AC, countable choice and dependent choice as foundational axioms, so
using one *within its declared scope* is not a defect.

## Output — the only thing you return

Plain markdown. For each finding, one block:

```
### FINDING 1, 2, 3, ... — FATAL or NONFATAL — location: title / Statement / [L#] / step X.Y / Remark
CLAIM AS WRITTEN: "<verbatim quote of the offending text>"
WHY IT FAILS: <the concrete false claim, unlicensed inference, missing
hypothesis, or inaccurate citation — with the verbatim dependency text that
does or does not license it>
WHAT WOULD FIX IT: <the smallest correction you can name, or "not obvious">
```

If, having genuinely tried to refute it, you find nothing fatal, say so plainly
and list what you checked. Finish with one line: `N fatal, M nonfatal`.

A confident empty reading is worse than useless here. Either name a concrete
defect with its quotation, or state clearly that you could not find one.

## Example

Let $I := [0,1]$ carry the metric $d(s,t) = |s-t|$ inherited from $\mathbb{R}$
([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]], [[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]) and
let $\mathbb{R}$ carry the same metric. Write $C(I,\mathbb{R})$ for the
continuous real functions on $I$, $\bar\rho$ for the uniform metric of
[[lem-uniform-metric-on-a-function-space]] and $d_\infty$ for the supremum metric
of [[lem-sup-metric-is-a-metric]]. Then:

1. every $f \in C(I,\mathbb{R})$ is bounded, so $d_\infty$ is defined on
   $C(I,\mathbb{R})$;
2. $\bar\rho$ and $d_\infty$ are **uniformly equivalent** on $C(I,\mathbb{R})$,
   hence induce the same topology there
   ([[def-equivalent-metrics]], [[thm-metric-equivalence-hierarchy]]);
3. $\big(C(I,\mathbb{R}), \bar\rho\big)$ is a complete metric space
   ([[def-complete-metric-space]]).

**Claim 2 is this page's guarantee that no second notion of convergence has been
created.** [[lem-uniform-metric-on-a-function-space]] mints a metric on
$Y^{X}$ that is *not* the published supremum metric — it truncates distances at
$1$ and needs no boundedness hypothesis — and a reader who has met $d_\infty$
first is entitled to ask whether "uniform convergence" now means two things. On
the set where both are defined it does not: the two metrics take different values
but have the same open sets, so they have the same convergent sequences, the same
continuous functions and the same closed sets.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $I = [0,1]$ with $d(s,t) = |s-t|$, the target $\mathbb{R}$ with the same metric, $C(I,\mathbb{R})$, the truncated metric $\bar d = \min\{d,1\}$ on $\mathbb{R}$, the uniform metric $\bar\rho$ and, once claim 1 is available, the supremum metric $d_\infty(f,g) = \sup_{t \in I} |f(t)-g(t)|$.

[L1] $I$ is a nonempty compact metric space: it is bounded, lying in $B(0,2)$, and closed in $\mathbb{R}$, so it is a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-heine-borel-rn]], claim 3, [[def-metric-compactness]], [[def-metric-topology]], [[def-metric-ball]], [[def-interval]]).

[L2] A continuous real function on a nonempty compact metric space is bounded and attains a greatest and a least value ([[thm-extreme-value-metric]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L3] $d_\infty(f,g) = \sup\{\, |f(t)-g(t)| : t \in I \,\}$ is a metric on the bounded real functions on a nonempty set, and the supremum is an upper bound of its set and the least one ([[lem-sup-metric-is-a-metric]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L4] $\bar d \le d$ and $\bar d \le 1$; if $\bar d(u,v) < 1$ then $\bar d(u,v) = d(u,v)$; $\bar\rho(f,g) = \sup\{\, \bar d(f(t),g(t)) : t \in I \,\}$ is an upper bound of that set and the least one ([[lem-bounded-remetrisation]], [[lem-uniform-metric-on-a-function-space]], [[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L5] Uniform equivalence of two metrics on one set, and the implication uniform $\Rightarrow$ topological ([[def-equivalent-metrics]], [[thm-metric-equivalence-hierarchy]], claim 2).

[L6] $(\mathbb{R}, d)$ is complete ([[thm-euclidean-space-complete]], claim 1), and for a nonempty topological domain and a complete metric target $C(X,Y)$ is complete in the uniform metric ([[thm-function-space-is-complete-for-a-complete-target]], claim 2, [[thm-uniform-limit-theorem]], [[def-topology-of-uniform-convergence]], [[def-continuous-map-top]], [[def-metrizable-space]], [[def-metric-space]]).

## Verification

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $I$ is nonempty and compact, and every $f \in C(I,\mathbb{R})$ is continuous on it, hence bounded; so $C(I,\mathbb{R})$ is a subset of the bounded real functions on $I$ and $d_\infty$ is defined on it, which is claim 1. [L1, L2, L3]

2.1 For all $f, g \in C(I,\mathbb{R})$ and every $t \in I$: $\bar d(f(t),g(t)) \le |f(t)-g(t)| \le d_\infty(f,g)$, so $d_\infty(f,g)$ bounds the set whose supremum is $\bar\rho(f,g)$ and therefore $\bar\rho(f,g) \le d_\infty(f,g)$. [step 1.1, L3, L4]

3.1 Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real and put $\delta := \min\{\varepsilon, 1\}/2$, a real with $0 < \delta \le 1/2 < 1$ and $\delta < \varepsilon$; if $\bar\rho(f,g) < \delta$ then for every $t \in I$ we have $\bar d(f(t),g(t)) \le \bar\rho(f,g) < \delta < 1$, hence $|f(t)-g(t)| = \bar d(f(t),g(t)) < \delta$, so $\delta$ bounds the set whose supremum is $d_\infty(f,g)$ and $d_\infty(f,g) \le \delta < \varepsilon$. [step 2.1, L3, L4]

4.1 Steps 2.1 and 3.1 give uniform equivalence: for a real $\varepsilon > 0$ the choice $\delta' := \varepsilon$ makes $d_\infty(f,g) < \delta'$ imply $\bar\rho(f,g) < \varepsilon$, and the $\delta$ of step 3.1 makes $\bar\rho(f,g) < \delta$ imply $d_\infty(f,g) < \varepsilon$; hence the two metrics are uniformly equivalent on $C(I,\mathbb{R})$ and therefore topologically equivalent, which is claim 2. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L5]

5.1 $(\mathbb{R},d)$ is complete and $I$ is a nonempty topological space, so $C(I,\mathbb{R})$ with the restriction of $\bar\rho$ is a complete metric space, which is claim 3. [step 1.1, L1, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- **The two metrics really are different functions.** Take $f$ constant $0$ and $g$ constant $2$: then $d_\infty(f,g) = 2$ while $\bar\rho(f,g) = 1$. What claim 2 says is that this difference is invisible to the topology, not that it does not exist. In particular an assertion about the *value* of the distance — a diameter, a Lipschitz constant, a radius — must name which metric it means.

- **Completeness is inherited from $\mathbb{R}$ and from closedness, in that order.** $\mathbb{R}$ is complete, so all the real functions on $I$ are complete in the uniform metric; the continuous ones form a closed subset by the uniform limit theorem ([[thm-uniform-limit-theorem]]); and a closed subset of a complete space is complete. Completeness in $d_\infty$ follows as well, since uniformly equivalent metrics have the same Cauchy sequences and the same convergent sequences, both conditions being expressed with $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ alone.

- **Compactness of $I$ is used only for claim 1.** Boundedness of every continuous function is what makes $d_\infty$ defined at all, and that is the extreme value theorem. On a non-compact domain the supremum metric is unavailable on all of $C(X,\mathbb{R})$, while the uniform metric $\bar\rho$ remains defined; that is the whole reason this page mints the truncated metric.

## The dependencies it declares, quoted verbatim from disk

Each block below is the claim-bearing text of one declared dependency.
These are the only statements the item is entitled to use. If a step
needs more than the text below gives, that is the defect — quote the
dependency text and show exactly what it fails to supply.

### `lem-uniform-metric-on-a-function-space` — lemma — For a nonempty set $X$ and a metric space $(Y,d)$ the uniform metric $\\bar\\rho(f,g) = \\sup_{x} \\min\\{d(f(x),g(x)), 1\\}$ is a metric on $Y^{X}$

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Statement

Let $X$ be a **nonempty** set, let $(Y,d)$ be a metric space
([[def-metric-space]]) and write

$$\bar d(u,v) \;:=\; \min\{\, d(u,v),\ 1 \,\} \qquad (u, v \in Y),$$

which is a metric on $Y$ with $\bar d \le 1$ everywhere
([[lem-bounded-remetrisation]], claims 1 and 2). For $f, g \in Y^{X}$
([[def-topology-of-pointwise-convergence]]) put

$$R(f,g) \;:=\; \{\, \bar d\big(f(x), g(x)\big) : x \in X \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}, \qquad \bar\rho(f,g) \;:=\; \sup R(f,g) .$$

This is well defined: $R(f,g)$ is nonempty because $X$ is, and $1$ is an upper
bound of it, so the least upper bound exists ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and
is unique ([[lem-sup-unique]]).

**Then $\bar\rho$ is a metric on $Y^{X}$** ([[def-metric-space]]), the **uniform
metric**, and $\bar\rho(f,g) \le 1$ for all $f, g$.

**Both hypotheses are used and neither is decoration.** Nonemptiness of $X$ is
what makes $R(f,g)$ nonempty; for $X = \varnothing$ the set $Y^{X}$ has a single
element and $\sup \varnothing$ does not exist in this library, which has no
extended real line ([[rem-sup-conventions]]). Truncating $d$ at $1$ is what makes
$R(f,g)$ bounded above **with no boundedness hypothesis on $f$ and $g$**; that is
the whole reason the truncation is there.

### `def-topology-of-uniform-convergence` — definition — Uniform convergence, and the topology of uniform convergence: the metric topology of the uniform metric on $Y^{X}$ and on $C(X,Y)$

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Let $X$ be a nonempty set and let $(Y,d)$ be a metric space
([[def-metric-space]]).

**Uniform convergence.** A sequence $(f_k)$ in $Y^{X}$
([[def-topology-of-pointwise-convergence]]) **converges uniformly** to
$f \in Y^{X}$ if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$
such that

$$d\big(f_k(x), f(x)\big) < \varepsilon \qquad \text{for every } x \in X \text{ and every } k \ge K .$$

The whole content is the quantifier order: one index $K$ must serve **every**
point of $X$ at once, whereas pointwise convergence allows $K$ to depend on the
point as well as on $\varepsilon$. As everywhere in this library $\mathbb{N}$
contains $0$ and a sequence is indexed from $0$
([[def-topology-of-pointwise-convergence]]).

**The topology.** The **topology of uniform convergence** (the *uniform
topology*) on $Y^{X}$ is the metric topology $\mathcal{T}_{\bar\rho}$
([[def-metric-topology]]) of the uniform metric

$$\bar\rho(f,g) = \sup_{x \in X} \min\{\, d(f(x),g(x)),\ 1 \,\}$$

of [[lem-uniform-metric-on-a-function-space]]. Its basic open sets are the balls
$B_{\bar\rho}(f,\varepsilon)$ ([[def-metric-ball]]), and $Y^{X}$ with this
topology is a metrizable space ([[def-metrizable-space]]).

**On $C(X,Y)$.** If $X$ carries a topology, the **topology of uniform
convergence on $C(X,Y)$** ([[def-continuous-map-top]]) is the subspace topology
inherited from $Y^{X}$ ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]). It is the metric topology
of the restriction of $\bar\rho$ to $C(X,Y) \times C(X,Y)$: the subspace topology
of a metric topology is the metric topology of the subspace metric
([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]], [[def-metrizable-space]]). So the two
readings of the phrase agree, and $C(X,Y)$ carrying it is again metrizable.

**The name is justified by the next item.** That convergence in
$\mathcal{T}_{\bar\rho}$ is exactly uniform convergence in the sense defined above
is not part of the definition; it is
[[lem-uniform-convergence-in-the-uniform-metric]], and it is what entitles the
topology to the name.

**$X$ is nonempty throughout.** The uniform metric is defined only for nonempty
$X$ ([[lem-uniform-metric-on-a-function-space]]), so the topology of uniform
convergence is defined only there. The notion of uniform convergence itself makes
sense for $X = \varnothing$ and is vacuous, every sequence converging uniformly
to the unique element of $Y^{\varnothing}$; nothing below uses that case.

### `thm-function-space-is-complete-for-a-complete-target` — theorem — If $(Y,d)$ is complete then $Y^{X}$ is complete in the uniform metric, and so is $C(X,Y)$

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Statement

Let $X$ be a **nonempty** set, let $(Y,d)$ be a **complete** metric space
([[def-complete-metric-space]]) and let $\bar\rho$ be the uniform metric on
$Y^{X}$ ([[lem-uniform-metric-on-a-function-space]]). Then:

1. $(Y^{X}, \bar\rho)$ is a complete metric space.
2. If in addition $X$ carries a topology, then $C(X,Y)$ with the restriction of
   $\bar\rho$ ([[def-topology-of-uniform-convergence]]) is a complete metric
   space.

**No choice principle is used.** The limit function is defined by a formula, not
chosen: a Cauchy sequence in a complete metric space has exactly one limit
([[lem-metric-limits-unique]]), so $x \mapsto \lim_k f_k(x)$ is a function, and
nothing is selected.

### `thm-uniform-limit-theorem` — theorem — A uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous, so $C(X,Y)$ is closed in $Y^{X}$ under the uniform metric

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Statement

Let $(X,\mathcal{T}_X)$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]) and
let $(Y,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]) carrying its metric
topology. Then:

1. **The $\varepsilon/3$ criterion.** Let $f : X \to Y$ be a function such that
   for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a **continuous** $g : X \to Y$ with
   $$d\big(f(x), g(x)\big) < \varepsilon \qquad \text{for every } x \in X .$$
   Then $f$ is continuous ([[def-continuous-map-top]]).
2. **Uniform limit theorem.** If $X$ is nonempty, $(f_k)$ is a sequence of
   continuous maps $X \to Y$ and $(f_k)$ converges uniformly to $f$
   ([[def-topology-of-uniform-convergence]]), then $f$ is continuous.
3. **Closedness.** If $X$ is nonempty, $C(X,Y)$ is a closed subset of
   $(Y^{X}, \bar\rho)$, the uniform metric being that of
   [[lem-uniform-metric-on-a-function-space]].

**The domain is an arbitrary topological space**, not a metric space: nothing in
the argument uses a distance in $X$. Only the target carries a metric, and it
carries one because the hypothesis of claim 1 is a statement about distances in
$Y$.

**No choice principle is used, and claim 3 in particular is choice free.** The
proof of claim 3 instantiates *one* continuous $g$ for each $\varepsilon$ and uses
it immediately, rather than manufacturing a sequence of them; a sequential
argument through [[thm-metric-sequential-closure]] would spend the Axiom of
Countable Choice, and that route is deliberately not taken.

### `lem-sup-metric-is-a-metric` — lemma — The supremum metric $d_\\infty(f,g) = \\sup_x |f(x) - g(x)|$ is a metric on the bounded real-valued functions on a nonempty set

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $S$ be a nonempty set. Call a function $f : S \to \mathbb{R}$ **bounded** when
its range $f[S] = \{f(s) : s \in S\}$ is a bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-bounded-set]]), and write

$$\mathcal{B}(S) := \{\, f : f \text{ is a bounded function } S \to \mathbb{R} \,\}.$$

For $f, g \in \mathcal{B}(S)$ put $D(f,g) := \{\, |f(s) - g(s)| : s \in S \,\}$ and

$$d_\infty(f,g) := \sup D(f,g).$$

This is well defined: $D(f,g)$ is nonempty because $S$ is, and it is bounded
above (step 1.1 below), so its least upper bound exists
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and is unique ([[lem-sup-unique]]).

**Then $d_\infty$ is a metric on $\mathcal{B}(S)$** ([[def-metric-space]]), the
**supremum metric** (also called the uniform metric).

The hypotheses ensure that the formula is a finite real-valued metric for every
pair in the stated function space. Boundedness of $f$ and $g$ makes $D(f,g)$
bounded above, and nonemptiness of $S$ makes it nonempty. Some unbounded pairs
can still have a finite supremum, but allowing all real-valued functions would
not give a finite-valued metric: for example, on $S=\mathbb{R}$ the functions
$f(s)=s$ and $g(s)=0$ make $D(f,g)$ unbounded above
([[rem-sup-conventions]]).

### `thm-extreme-value-metric` — theorem — A continuous real-valued function on a nonempty compact metric space is bounded and attains a greatest and a least value

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $(X,d)$ be a nonempty compact metric space ([[def-metric-compactness]],
[[def-metric-space]]) and let $f : X \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous
([[def-metric-continuity]]), $\mathbb{R}$ carrying its usual metric
$d_{\mathbb{R}}(s,t) = |s-t|$ ([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]). Then the
image $f[X]$ is bounded above and below ([[def-bounded-set]]), and it has a
maximum and a minimum ([[def-max-min]]): there are points
$x_{\max}, x_{\min} \in X$ with

$$f(x_{\min}) \;\le\; f(x) \;\le\; f(x_{\max}) \qquad \text{for every } x \in X,$$

and then $f(x_{\max}) = \sup f[X]$ and $f(x_{\min}) = \inf f[X]$
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-infimum]]).

Nonemptiness of $X$ is a hypothesis and not an oversight: for $X = \emptyset$ the
image is empty and has neither a supremum nor a maximum. No choice principle is
used.

### `def-metric-compactness` — definition — Open cover, subcover, compact metric space, and compact subset of a metric space

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]), with open sets as in
[[def-metric-topology]] and balls as in [[def-metric-ball]].

- An **open cover** of $(X,d)$ is a family $\mathcal{U}$ of open subsets of $X$
  with $X = \bigcup \mathcal{U}$, where
  $\bigcup \mathcal{U} = \{\, x \in X : x \in U \text{ for some } U \in \mathcal{U} \,\}$.
- A **subcover** of $\mathcal{U}$ is a subfamily
  $\mathcal{V} \subseteq \mathcal{U}$ that is itself an open cover.
- A family $\mathcal{V}$ of sets is **finite** when $\mathcal{V} = \emptyset$ or
  there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and sets $V_0, \dots, V_n$ with
  $\mathcal{V} = \{V_0, \dots, V_n\}$; repetitions in the list are allowed and
  harmless.
- $(X,d)$ is **compact** when every open cover of it has a finite subcover: for
  every open cover $\mathcal{U}$, either $X = \emptyset$ and the empty subfamily
  covers it, or there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
  $U_0, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{U}$ with
  $$X = U_0 \cup \dots \cup U_n .$$
- A subset $A \subseteq X$ is a **compact subset** of $X$ when the metric
  subspace $(A, d_A)$ is a compact metric space, $d_A$ being the restriction of
  $d$ to $A \times A$ ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]).

**Compactness of a subset is defined intrinsically, and only intrinsically.**
The last clause speaks about the subspace $(A,d_A)$ and its own open sets, not
about families of open subsets of the ambient $X$. The two readings do agree,
but that is a theorem and not a convention: it is
[[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]], and no item of this library may use the
ambient reading without citing it. Taking the intrinsic reading as the
definition is what makes "compact" a property of the metric space $(A,d_A)$
alone, so that a set compact in one ambient space is compact in every other one
containing it isometrically.

**The empty space is compact**, since the empty subfamily of any family covers
it; this is the reason the clause above is written with the two cases. The
one-point space is compact too, and so is every space listed as
$\{x_0, \dots, x_n\}$: given a cover, each $x_i$ lies in some member, and
finitely many members chosen in this way already cover.

**The finiteness convention, and how it is used both ways.** "Finite" above is
the listing form, matching the finite lists of
[[def-finite-intersection-property]]. It agrees with the definition of
finiteness by equinumerosity with a natural number ([[def-countable]]), and
both directions of the agreement are available and are used below:

- A nonempty finite set $F$ in the sense of [[def-countable]] satisfies
  $F \approx m$ for some $m \ge 1$, and a bijection $m \to F$ is exactly a
  listing $F = \{a_0, \dots, a_{m-1}\}$.
- Conversely a set listed as $A = \{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$, that is the image of a
  function $a$ with domain $\sigma(n)$, is finite in the sense of
  [[def-countable]]: the map sending $x \in A$ to the least $i \le n$ with
  $a_i = x$ is an injection of $A$ into $\sigma(n)$, so $A$ is equinumerous with
  a subset of $\mathbb{N}$ bounded above, and such a subset is finite
  ([[lem-subset-of-countable]]).

Neither direction uses a choice principle: the second selects nothing, taking a
least index instead.

### `thm-heine-borel-rn` — theorem — Heine-Borel in $\\mathbb{R}^n$: with the Euclidean metric a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded, and the proof by bisection uses no choice principle; the same holds on the real line

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, let $\mathbb{R}^n$ be the set of functions
$n \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $d_2$ be the Euclidean metric on it
([[lem-metrics-on-rn]]). Then:

1. **Closed boxes are compact.** For reals $a_k \le b_k$ $(k < n)$ the box
   $Q = \{\, x \in \mathbb{R}^n : a_k \le x_k \le b_k \text{ for every } k < n \,\}$
   is a compact subset of $(\mathbb{R}^n, d_2)$ ([[def-metric-compactness]]).
2. **Heine-Borel.** A subset $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is a compact subset of
   $(\mathbb{R}^n, d_2)$ if and only if $K$ is closed in $\mathbb{R}^n$
   ([[def-metric-topology]]) and bounded
   ([[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]).
3. **The real line.** A subset $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a compact subset of
   $(\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$, the usual metric $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) = |x-y|$
   ([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]), if and only if $K$ is closed in
   $\mathbb{R}$ and bounded.

**No choice principle is used.** The bisection below halves one coordinate at a
time and takes the **left** half whenever the left half still fails to be finitely
covered, the right half otherwise: a rule with two outcomes, decided by a
property of the box, not a selection. That is the whole reason the theorem is
available in ZF, while the general "complete and totally bounded implies compact"
([[thm-complete-and-totally-bounded-implies-compact]]) is not.

The hypothesis $n \ge 1$ is inherited from [[lem-metrics-on-rn]], which defines
$\mathbb{R}^n$ and its metrics only there; the last remark below records what
happens at $n = 0$.

### `def-interval` — definition — Intervals of $\\mathbb{R}$: the nine order-convex forms, nondegeneracy, and length

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

### `lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space` — lemma — The absolute value makes $\\mathbb{R}$ a metric space: $d(x,y) = |x-y|$ is a metric, its open balls are the intervals $(x-r, x+r)$, and it is unbounded

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Define $d_{\mathbb{R}} : \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ by
$d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) := |x - y|$ ([[def-abs-value]]). Then:

1. $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ is a metric on $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-metric-space]]); it is
   called the **usual metric** of $\mathbb{R}$.
2. For $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and $r > 0$ the open ball is the bounded open interval
   ([[def-interval]], [[def-metric-ball]])
   $$B(x,r) = (x-r,\ x+r),$$
   and the closed ball is $\bar B(x,r) = [x-r,\ x+r]$.
3. Consequently $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is open in the metric topology of
   $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-metric-topology]]) exactly when for every $x \in U$
   there is $r > 0$ with $(x-r, x+r) \subseteq U$. This topology is called the
   **usual topology** of $\mathbb{R}$.
4. $(\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$ is not a bounded metric space
   ([[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]): no ball contains $\mathbb{R}$, so
   $\operatorname{diam}(\mathbb{R})$ is not defined.

### `def-equivalent-metrics` — definition — Topologically, uniformly and Lipschitz equivalent metrics on a set

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $X$ be a set and let $d$ and $d'$ both be metrics on $X$
([[def-metric-space]]). Note that the underlying set is the same; nothing below
compares metrics on different sets.

- $d$ and $d'$ are **topologically equivalent** if they have the same metric
  topology ([[def-metric-topology]]):
  $$\mathcal{T}_d = \mathcal{T}_{d'} .$$
- $d$ and $d'$ are **uniformly equivalent** if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$
  there are reals $\delta > 0$ and $\delta' > 0$ such that, for all
  $x, y \in X$,
  $$d(x,y) < \delta \;\Longrightarrow\; d'(x,y) < \varepsilon \qquad \text{and} \qquad d'(x,y) < \delta' \;\Longrightarrow\; d(x,y) < \varepsilon .$$
- $d$ and $d'$ are **Lipschitz equivalent** if there are reals
  $\alpha, \beta > 0$ with
  $$\alpha\, d(x,y) \;\le\; d'(x,y) \;\le\; \beta\, d(x,y) \qquad \text{for all } x, y \in X .$$

**What the middle condition says in words.** It is the statement that both
identity maps $\mathrm{id} : (X,d) \to (X,d')$ and
$\mathrm{id} : (X,d') \to (X,d)$ are *uniformly* continuous: the same $\delta$
works at every pair of points, not merely at each point separately as in
[[def-metric-continuity]]. Uniform continuity has no definition of its own at
this point in the reading order, so the condition is written out in full above;
a later page defines it, and until then this write-out is what earlier pages
quote.

**Each of the three is an equivalence relation on the metrics on $X$.**
Reflexivity is immediate ($\delta = \varepsilon$, and $\alpha = \beta = 1$);
symmetry is built into the statements, the uniform one being symmetric by
construction and the Lipschitz one because
$\alpha d \le d' \le \beta d$ gives $\beta^{-1} d' \le d \le \alpha^{-1} d'$;
and transitivity follows by composing the $\delta$s and multiplying the
constants.

### `thm-metric-equivalence-hierarchy` — theorem — Lipschitz equivalence implies uniform equivalence implies topological equivalence

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $d$ and $d'$ be metrics on the same set $X$ ([[def-metric-space]]), with the
three equivalences as in [[def-equivalent-metrics]]. Then:

1. If $d$ and $d'$ are Lipschitz equivalent, they are uniformly equivalent.
2. If $d$ and $d'$ are uniformly equivalent, they are topologically equivalent.

**Strictness is not claimed here.** The theorem asserts the two implications and
nothing more; that neither reverses is witnessed by explicit pairs of metrics on
the companion page, and those witnesses are not prerequisites of this theorem.
See the first remark below.

### `thm-euclidean-space-complete` — theorem — $\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n \\ge 1$ with the Euclidean metric are complete, componentwise from the Cauchy criterion in $\\mathbb{R}$

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

1. $(\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$ with the usual metric $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) = |x-y|$
   ([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]) is a complete metric space
   ([[def-complete-metric-space]]).
2. Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$ and let $d_2$ be the Euclidean metric on
   $\mathbb{R}^n$ ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]]). Then $(\mathbb{R}^n, d_2)$ is complete.

**The hypothesis $n \ge 1$ is inherited and is not decoration.**
[[lem-metrics-on-rn]] defines $\mathbb{R}^n$ and its three metrics only for
$n \ge 1$, because at $n = 0$ the metric $d_\infty$ would be a maximum over the
empty index set. Every statement about $\mathbb{R}^n$ in this library carries the
hypothesis, and this one does too.

### `def-metrizable-space` — definition — Metrizable space: a topological space whose topology is induced by some metric; metrizability is topological, the metric is not

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ ([[def-topological-space]]) is
**metrizable** if there is a metric $d$ on $X$ ([[def-metric-space]]) whose
metric topology is $\mathcal{T}$, that is $\mathcal{T} = \mathcal{T}_d$
([[def-metric-topology]]). Such a $d$ is said to **induce** or **metrise**
$\mathcal{T}$.

**The definition presupposes that $\mathcal{T}_d$ is a topology in the sense of
[[def-topological-space]], and it is.** By [[def-metric-topology]] both
$\varnothing$ and $X$ are open in $(X,d)$, which is (T1), and by
[[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]] the family $\mathcal{T}_d$ is closed under
arbitrary unions, which is (T2), and under intersections of $n \ge 1$ members,
which contains (T3). So every metric space is a topological space, and the
metric-space development of this library is a special case of the present one.

**The standard local notions in the two developments agree after translating
their neighbourhood conventions.** Let $d$ be a metric on $X$ and give $X$ the
topology $\mathcal{T}_d$.

- *Neighbourhoods and balls.* [[def-metric-topology]] uses "neighbourhood" for
  an open set containing $x$, whereas [[def-neighbourhood-top]] also allows a
  non-open superset of such a set. Thus the two collections are not literally
  equal, but the open metric neighbourhoods are cofinal in the broader
  neighbourhood filter. The balls $B(x,r)$, $r > 0$ ([[def-metric-ball]]), are
  open ([[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]]) and form a neighbourhood base at $x$:
  any neighbourhood $N$ contains an open $U \ni x$, hence a ball around $x$ by
  [[def-metric-topology]]. The balls of radius $1/n$ alone already suffice
  ([[lem-metric-ball-neighbourhood-base]]).
- *Interior, closure, boundary.* [[def-metric-interior-closure-boundary]] defines
  them by the same conditions with balls in place of neighbourhoods, and the
  previous bullet makes the two conditions equivalent; the metric closure is the
  smallest closed superset ([[thm-metric-closure-characterisation]]), which is the
  definition used here ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]). So the two
  closures, the two interiors and the two boundaries are the same three
  operations.
- *Convergence.* $x_k \to p$ in the sense of [[def-sequence-convergence-top]] is
  "eventually in every neighbourhood of $p$", and by the first bullet this is
  "eventually in every ball around $p$", which is [[def-metric-convergence]].
- *Continuity.* $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ continuity at $a$
  ([[def-metric-continuity]]) says that every ball around $f(a)$ has a ball
  around $a$ mapped into it, which by the first bullet is continuity at $a$ in
  the sense of [[def-continuous-map-top]].

- *Subspaces.* For $A \subseteq X$ the subspace topology
  $\{\, U \cap A : U \in \mathcal{T}_d \,\}$ of [[def-subspace-topology-top]] is
  exactly the metric topology of the subspace metric $d_A$
  ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]), so the two uses of the phrase
  *subspace topology* in this library name one thing. Indeed
  $B_A(a,r) = B_X(a,r) \cap A$: a trace $U \cap A$ is $d_A$-open, since each of
  its points $a$ has $B_X(a,r) \subseteq U$ and hence $B_A(a,r) \subseteq U \cap A$;
  and a $d_A$-open $W$ is the trace of
  $U := \bigcup \{\, B_X(a,r) : a \in W,\ r > 0,\ B_X(a,r) \cap A \subseteq W \,\}$,
  which is $d_X$-open, satisfies $U \cap A = W$, and involves no choice principle,
  the union being taken over a set of pairs rather than over a selection.

Consequently the metric-space notions of interior, closure, boundary, density,
convergence, continuity and subspace agree with the topological notions here,
and statements about them transfer once a metric is named. For neighbourhoods
the transfer uses the explicit convention change above: a metric-page
neighbourhood is an open topological neighbourhood, while every topological
neighbourhood contains one.

**Metrizability is a topological property; the metric is not part of it.** If
$h : X \to Y$ is a homeomorphism ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]) and $d$
metrises $X$, then $d'(y_1,y_2) := d(h^{-1}(y_1), h^{-1}(y_2))$ is a metric on
$Y$ — the three axioms transfer along the bijection $h^{-1}$ — and
$h[B_d(x,r)] = B_{d'}(h(x), r)$, so $h$ carries a basis of $\mathcal{T}_d$ to a
basis of $\mathcal{T}_{d'}$ and $\mathcal{T}_{d'} = h[\mathcal{T}_d] = \mathcal{T}_Y$.
Hence $Y$ is metrizable. The metric itself, however, is **not** determined by the
topology: two metrics on one set may induce the same topology without agreeing,
which is exactly topological equivalence ([[def-equivalent-metrics]]), and
properties of a metric that are not properties of its topology, boundedness among
them, are therefore not properties of a metrizable space.

**Two things every metrizable space has.** It is **Hausdorff**: distinct points
have disjoint open neighbourhoods, by [[thm-metric-hausdorff-separation]] applied
to any metric inducing the topology. And it is **first countable**
([[def-first-countable-top]]), by [[lem-metric-ball-neighbourhood-base]]. Either
failure is therefore an obstruction to metrizability, and this page uses the
first of them to exhibit a topology induced by no metric.

**Sequential limits in a metrizable space are unique, so the notation
$\lim_k x_k$ is available there.** In a metric space a sequence has at most one
limit ([[lem-metric-limits-unique]]), and by the agreement of convergence above
that uniqueness is a statement about the topology alone; so within a metrizable
space, and only there, this page writes $\lim_k x_k$ in the ordinary way. In a
general space the symbol is unavailable ([[def-sequence-convergence-top]]).

**The usual topology of $\mathbb{R}$.** The absolute value makes $\mathbb{R}$ a
metric space under $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) = |x-y|$, its open balls are the bounded
open intervals, and the resulting metric topology is what claim 3 of
[[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]] names the **usual topology** of $\mathbb{R}$.
That is the topology meant by the phrase throughout these two pages, and
$\mathbb{R}$ carrying it is metrizable by definition. Every statement about it on
these two pages is proved from the metric $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ and the bridge above,
and no example re-derives any of it.

### `def-bounded-set` — definition — Lower bound, bounded below, bounded set

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ denotes the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a subset of it.

The notions **upper bound** and **bounded above** are already fixed by
[[def-complete-ordered-field]] and are only recalled here, never redefined:
$u \in \mathbb{R}$ is an *upper bound* of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$, and
$S$ is *bounded above* if it has at least one upper bound. The dual notions are:

- $\ell \in \mathbb{R}$ is a **lower bound** of $S$ if $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.
- $S$ is **bounded below** if it has at least one lower bound.
- $S$ is **bounded** if it is both bounded above and bounded below, that is, if
  there are $\ell, u \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\ell \le s \le u$ for every $s \in S$.

### `def-metric-topology` — definition — The metric topology: a set is open when every one of its points has a ball around it inside the set; closed means open complement

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]).

A subset $U \subseteq X$ is **open in $(X,d)$** if for every $x \in U$ there is a
real $r > 0$ with $B(x,r) \subseteq U$ ([[def-metric-ball]]). A subset
$F \subseteq X$ is **closed in $(X,d)$** if its complement $X \setminus F$ is
open.

The collection

$$\mathcal{T}_d := \{\, U \subseteq X : U \text{ is open in } (X,d) \,\}$$

of all open subsets is the **metric topology** of $d$ on $X$. A subset of $X$
that is both open and closed is called **clopen**.

**Two sets are open for trivial reasons.** $\emptyset$ is open, because the
defining condition quantifies over no points; and $X$ is open, because
$B(x,r) \subseteq X$ for every $x$ and every $r > 0$. Consequently $X$ and
$\emptyset$ are also closed, and both are clopen.

**A neighbourhood of a point $x$** is any open set containing $x$. The condition
above therefore reads: $U$ is open exactly when every point of $U$ has a ball
around it inside $U$, and it is the balls alone that have to be tested.

**The metric, not the set, determines $\mathcal{T}_d$.** Two metrics on the same
set may have different metric topologies, and two different metrics may have the
same one; the systematic comparison is [[def-equivalent-metrics]].

### `def-metric-ball` — definition — Open ball, closed ball and sphere in a metric space

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]), let $x \in X$ and let
$r \in \mathbb{R}$ with $r > 0$ ([[def-real-order]]). Define

$$B(x,r) := \{\, y \in X : d(x,y) < r \,\}, \qquad \bar B(x,r) := \{\, y \in X : d(x,y) \le r \,\}, \qquad S(x,r) := \{\, y \in X : d(x,y) = r \,\}.$$

$B(x,r)$ is the **open ball**, $\bar B(x,r)$ the **closed ball** and $S(x,r)$ the
**sphere** of **centre** $x$ and **radius** $r$. The radius is always a strictly
positive real; a ball of radius $0$ or of negative radius is never written in
this library.

**Immediate consequences of the definitions.** For every $x \in X$ and $r > 0$:

- $x \in B(x,r)$, because $d(x,x) = 0 < r$ (axiom (M1) of [[def-metric-space]]);
  in particular open and closed balls are nonempty.
- $B(x,r) \subseteq \bar B(x,r)$ and $S(x,r) \subseteq \bar B(x,r)$, and
  $\bar B(x,r)$ is the disjoint union of $B(x,r)$ and $S(x,r)$, by trichotomy of
  the order of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]):
  each $y$ satisfies exactly one of $d(x,y) < r$, $d(x,y) = r$, $d(x,y) > r$.
- If $0 < s \le r$ then $B(x,s) \subseteq B(x,r)$ and
  $\bar B(x,s) \subseteq \bar B(x,r)$, by transitivity of the order.
- Nonnegativity of the metric ([[lem-metric-nonnegativity]]) is what forces the
  radius convention, and it forces it for the **open** ball only: if $r \le 0$
  then $B(x,r) = \{y : d(x,y) < r\}$ is empty, because $d(x,y) \ge 0 \ge r$
  for every $y$. The other two sets behave differently at $r = 0$, and the
  convention $r > 0$ excludes them for uniformity rather than for emptiness:
  $\bar B(x,0) = S(x,0) = \{x\}$, since $d(x,y) \le 0$ together with
  $d(x,y) \ge 0$ gives $d(x,y) = 0$ and hence $y = x$ by (M1). For $r < 0$ all
  three sets are empty.

**A sphere may be empty, and so the three sets are not on a par.** For $r > 0$
the open and closed balls always contain $x$, but nothing in the definition
produces a point at distance exactly $r$ from $x$. If a metric takes only the
values $0$ and $1$, as the discrete metric on the companion page does, then
$S(x,2) = \emptyset$ while $B(x,2) = \bar B(x,2)$ is the whole space. So
nonemptiness of a sphere is never available by convention: where it is used, it
is proved.

**The ambient space is part of the notation.** $B(x,r)$ depends on $(X,d)$ and
not on $x$ and $r$ alone. When more than one space or more than one metric is in
play we write $B_X(x,r)$, or $B_d(x,r)$, and likewise for $\bar B$ and $S$. This
matters as soon as subspaces appear ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]): a
ball of a subspace is the trace on it of a ball of the ambient space, and the two
are different sets.

### `def-max-min` — definition — Maximum and minimum of a set

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $m \in \mathbb{R}$.

- $m$ is a **maximum** (or *greatest element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $s \le m$
  for every $s \in S$.
- $m$ is a **minimum** (or *least element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $m \le s$
  for every $s \in S$.

A set has at most one maximum: if $m_1$ and $m_2$ are both maxima then
$m_1 \in S$ gives $m_1 \le m_2$ and $m_2 \in S$ gives $m_2 \le m_1$, so
$m_1 = m_2$ by antisymmetry of the order, which is immediate from the trichotomy
axiom of an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).
The same argument applies to minima, so we may write $\max S$ and $\min S$.

### `lem-finite-set-has-max` — lemma — Every nonempty finite set of reals has a maximum and a minimum

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and all $a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n \in \mathbb{R}$, the
set $\{a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ has a maximum and a minimum ([[def-max-min]]).

What is proved below is exactly the displayed statement, by induction on $n$.

The usual reading, that *every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has a
maximum and a minimum*, follows once one identifies the nonempty finite subsets
of $\mathbb{R}$ with the sets listable as $\{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$. That
identification is recorded as a stipulation in the Given below, because this page
has no definition of finiteness to prove it against. **It is discharged, not
merely assumed**: [[lem-finite-subsets-listable]] proves that the two
descriptions of a nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ agree. That lemma is
recorded in `justified_by` rather than in `deps`, since it is about the sets this
lemma quantifies over and therefore depends on this one. This is what licenses
the notation
$\max\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ and $\min\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ for finite sets of
**real** numbers from this page onwards.

### `lem-bounded-remetrisation` — lemma — $\\min(d,1)$ and $d/(1+d)$ are metrics uniformly equivalent to $d$, so every metric space carries a bounded metric with the same topology

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]) and define, for
$x, y \in X$,

$$d'(x,y) := \min\{\, d(x,y),\ 1 \,\}, \qquad d''(x,y) := \frac{d(x,y)}{1 + d(x,y)} .$$

Both are well defined: $d(x,y) \ge 0$ ([[lem-metric-nonnegativity]]), so
$1 + d(x,y) > 0$ and is invertible, and the minimum of a two-element set of
reals exists ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]). Then:

1. $d'$ and $d''$ are metrics on $X$.
2. $d'(x,y) \le 1$ and $d''(x,y) < 1$ for all $x,y$; hence $(X,d')$ and
   $(X,d'')$ are bounded metric spaces
   ([[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]), and if $X \ne \emptyset$ then
   $\operatorname{diam}(X) \le 1$ for both.
3. $d'$ and $d''$ are each uniformly equivalent to $d$, hence topologically
   equivalent to it ([[def-equivalent-metrics]],
   [[thm-metric-equivalence-hierarchy]]).

**Consequently every metric space carries a bounded metric with exactly the same
topology**, so boundedness cannot be read off the topology alone.

### `def-complete-metric-space` — definition — Complete metric space: every Cauchy sequence converges in the space

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]).

$(X,d)$ is **complete** if every Cauchy sequence in $(X,d)$
([[def-cauchy-in-metric]]) converges to a point of $X$
([[def-metric-convergence]]).

A subset $A \subseteq X$ is called **complete** when the metric subspace
$(A, d_A)$ is complete ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]); as always, the
metric is part of the data, and $d_A$ is the restriction of $d$ to $A \times A$.

**The limit is unique when it exists**, since limits in a metric space are unique
([[lem-metric-limits-unique]]), so a complete space assigns to each of its Cauchy
sequences one point and not a set of points.

**Completeness is a property of the pair $(X,d)$, not of $X$ and not of the
topology of $d$.** Both quantifiers in the definition are about the metric: the
Cauchy condition is stated with distances, and so is convergence. Two metrics on
the same set can have the same open sets while exactly one of them is complete,
which is the content of [[fs-completeness-is-a-topological-property]] and its
witness. Read the word *complete* as an abbreviation for *complete with respect
to this metric*, always.

### `def-metric-space` — definition — Metric space: $d(x,y) = 0$ iff $x = y$, symmetry, and the triangle inequality; pseudometric and ultrametric

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) constructed in this
library ([[def-real-numbers]]) and carrying its order ([[def-real-order]]).

Let $X$ be a set. A **metric** on $X$ is a function
$d : X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $x, y, z \in X$:

- **(M1) Separation.** $d(x,y) = 0$ if and only if $x = y$.
- **(M2) Symmetry.** $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$.
- **(M3) Triangle inequality.** $d(x,z) \le d(x,y) + d(y,z)$.

A **metric space** is a pair $(X,d)$ consisting of a set $X$ and a metric $d$ on
it. The elements of $X$ are its **points** and $d(x,y)$ is the **distance** from
$x$ to $y$. When only one metric is in play we write $X$ for $(X,d)$; when
several are, the metric is always named.

**The values of a metric are real numbers.** The codomain is $\mathbb{R}$, so
$d(x,y)$ is an honest element of the complete ordered field and every
inequality above is an inequality there. No infinite value is permitted;
[[rem-metric-axiom-conventions]] records why extended metrics are not treated in
this library.

**Nonnegativity is deliberately absent from the axiom list.** Many texts add a
fourth axiom $d(x,y) \ge 0$. It is redundant: (M1), (M2) and (M3) already force
it, as [[lem-metric-nonnegativity]] proves. Nothing below assumes it before that
lemma is available.

**Pseudometric.** A **pseudometric** on $X$ is a function
$p : X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying (M2), (M3) and the weakening

- **(M1') Reflexivity.** $p(x,x) = 0$ for every $x \in X$

of (M1). A pseudometric may therefore assign distance $0$ to two distinct
points. Every metric is a pseudometric, and a pseudometric is a metric exactly
when $p(x,y) = 0$ forces $x = y$.

**Ultrametric.** An **ultrametric** on $X$ is a metric $d$ that in addition
satisfies

- **(M3') Strong triangle inequality.** $d(x,z) \le \max\{d(x,y), d(y,z)\}$

for all $x, y, z \in X$, where the maximum is that of a two-element subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, which exists and is one of the two elements
([[def-max-min]], [[lem-finite-set-has-max]]). An **ultrametric space** is a pair
$(X,d)$ with $d$ an ultrametric.

### `def-isometry-and-metric-embedding` — definition — Isometry, isometric embedding, and the subspace metric on a subset

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ be metric spaces ([[def-metric-space]]).

**Isometric embedding and isometry.** A function $f : X \to Y$ is an
**isometric embedding** if

$$d_Y\big(f(x), f(x')\big) = d_X(x,x') \qquad \text{for all } x, x' \in X ,$$

and an **isometry** if it is in addition bijective
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]). Two metric spaces are **isometric** if
some isometry between them exists.

**Subspace metric.** Let $A \subseteq X$ and let

$$d_A := d_X \restriction (A \times A)$$

be the restriction of $d_X$ to pairs from $A$. Then $d_A$ is a metric on $A$:
the three axioms (M1), (M2), (M3) of [[def-metric-space]] are conditions on
triples of points, and each holds for points of $A$ because it holds for points
of $X$. The pair $(A, d_A)$ is the **metric subspace** $A$ of $X$, and the
inclusion $A \to X$ is an isometric embedding by construction. The metric
topology of $d_A$ ([[def-metric-topology]]) is the **subspace topology** of $A$.

**Balls of a subspace are traces of balls of the ambient space.** For $a \in A$
and $r > 0$,

$$B_A(a,r) = B_X(a,r) \cap A ,$$

directly from the definitions: a point $z$ lies in the left side exactly when
$z \in A$ and $d_A(a,z) = d_X(a,z) < r$ ([[def-metric-ball]]). This is why the
ambient space is always written into the ball notation, and it is the source of
every apparent paradox about balls in subspaces.

### `def-complete-ordered-field` — definition — Complete ordered field (least-upper-bound property)

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq F$.

- $u \in F$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$; $S$ is
  **bounded above** if it has an upper bound.
- $u \in F$ is a **least upper bound** (or **supremum**, $\sup S$) of $S$ if $u$
  is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le u'$ for every upper bound $u'$ of $S$.

$F$ is a **complete ordered field** (equivalently, $F$ has the
**least-upper-bound property**, or is **Dedekind complete**) if every nonempty
$S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$.

### `lem-sup-unique` — lemma — Suprema and infima are unique

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Statement

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. If $u_1$ and $u_2$ are both least upper bounds of
$S$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), then $u_1 = u_2$. If $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$
are both greatest lower bounds of $S$ ([[def-infimum]]), then
$\ell_1 = \ell_2$.

Consequently a set has at most one supremum and at most one infimum, and the
notations $\sup S$ and $\inf S$ denote single, well-determined real numbers
whenever they exist.

### `def-continuous-map-top` — definition — Continuity of a map of topological spaces at a point and globally

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be topological spaces
([[def-topological-space]]), let $f : X \to Y$ be a function and let $x \in X$.
Neighbourhoods are as in [[def-neighbourhood-top]].

$f$ is **continuous at $x$** if for every neighbourhood $V$ of $f(x)$ in $Y$ the
preimage $f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ in $X$.

$f$ is **continuous** if it is continuous at every point of $X$.

**The same condition with open sets only.** $f$ is continuous at $x$ if and only
if for every open $V \subseteq Y$ with $f(x) \in V$ there is an open
$U \subseteq X$ with $x \in U$ and $f[U] \subseteq V$. Indeed, if $f$ is
continuous at $x$ and $V$ is such an open set, then $V$ is a neighbourhood of
$f(x)$, so $f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ and contains an open $U \ni x$,
which satisfies $f[U] \subseteq V$. Conversely, given the displayed condition and
a neighbourhood $V$ of $f(x)$, fix open $V_0$ with $f(x) \in V_0 \subseteq V$ and
then open $U \ni x$ with $f[U] \subseteq V_0$; then $x \in U \subseteq f^{-1}[V_0] \subseteq f^{-1}[V]$,
so $f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$. Both forms are used below and are the
same statement written twice.

**Preimage, not image.** $f^{-1}[V] = \{\, x \in X : f(x) \in V \,\}$
is the preimage in the sense of [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]] and is
defined for every function, invertible or not; no inverse function is being
asserted to exist. Continuity is a condition on preimages throughout, and the
corresponding conditions on images define the *open* and *closed* maps of a later
item, which are different notions.
