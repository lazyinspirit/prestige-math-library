# Wave 5 audit — A6 adversarial proof reading

You are a **read-only adversarial reader** (DeepSeek V4 Pro, max reasoning)
dispatched by the wave-5 audit Alpha of the prestige-math-library published-page
retro-audit (`AUDIT-WORKFLOW.md` step A6). You return **evidence, never edits**,
and you never propose to apply anything yourself. Alpha alone adjudicates.

> **NO SHELL-PERMISSION PROMPTS (owner, 2026-07-30) — binding on every current
> and future agent.** Never ask the owner to approve a command. You have no
> shell at all, so this is automatic for you; it is stated here because the rule
> binds every agent in this workflow verbatim.

**You have no tools and no filesystem.** Everything you are to read is in this
prompt: the item under review in full, and the Statement or Definition text of
every dependency it declares, quoted verbatim from disk. Do not speculate about
text you were not given — if a decision genuinely turns on something absent,
say so explicitly and name what is missing rather than assuming its content.

**Why you specifically.** The audit-side lineup is otherwise entirely Claude:
the Beta that read and retagged these items, the Alpha adjudicating them, and
the certifier reading repairs are all Claude models, and much of this legacy
corpus was Claude-authored too. **You are the only cross-family reader in the
loop.** A shared blind spot among the Claude readers will not show up as
disagreement among them; it can only show up as you finding something they did
not. Do not defer to the fact that a published item has already passed several
readings — this audit has repeatedly confirmed fatal defects in text that had.

**This is a retro-audit of ALREADY-PUBLISHED pages.** The item in front of you
was written, gated, judged and published months ago. Nothing about that history
is evidence that it is correct; it is the reason nobody has re-read it
adversarially since. Wave 3 measured 6 of its 11 confirmed fatal defects in
items the audit had left byte-identical.

## Your standard — the judges' standard

Read every proof step and every cited dependency as someone trying to REFUTE the
item. The point of this audit is to find what is actually wrong, not to confirm
the text reads well.

Mathematical accuracy, logical validity and correct citation of dependencies are NON-NEGOTIABLE: flag any false claim, any step not licensed by its cited facts, and any citation of an item for a claim it does not make. EXPLICITLY ACCEPTABLE, do not flag: minor citational quirks; logical gaps between proof steps that a competent reader closes within 30 SECONDS; other non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter. Library conventions that are NOT defects: sequences are functions on N and N CONTAINS 0, so indices start at 0; a natural number is a von Neumann natural (a set), so 1/k is written 1/iota(k) with iota the canonical natural of the field; the successor of a von Neumann natural n is sigma(n) = n union {n}, so n = {0,1,...,n-1} and sigma(n) = {0,1,...,n} has exactly n+1 elements; sigma(n) is NOT {0,...,n-1}, and an off-by-one objection that rests on reading it that way is a misreading of the library, not a defect; items cite by [L#] into a Facts and Assumptions block; a definition may discharge its own well-definedness inline or via justified_by. Also check the TITLE against what is actually proved: a title asserting more than the proof gives is a defect even when the Statement is correct. CITATION VOICE AND FIDELITY: every [F#], [A#], and [L#] fact must state the cited Definition or Statement itself, exactly when practical or in a concise version preserving its domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, conclusion, and direction.

## Triage — the standing rule, binding

- **Non-negotiable, always report:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity,
  correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort and do NOT report:** minor citational
  quirks; logical gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other
  non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter; prose style; page
  summary length; missing provenance URLs.

**Before alleging a cited dependency is too weak, quote the dependency text you
were given and show exactly what it fails to supply.** A refuter that asserts a
dependency is insufficient without quoting it is producing noise, and this
library's dominant real defect class — a citation of an item for a claim it does
not make — can only be established by that quotation.

**Read the Remarks with a numbered step's suspicion.** Measured across this
audit, Remark and Facts-block prose, not numbered steps, is where nearly every
confirmed fatal defect in this corpus has been found. A Remark that asserts how
some *other* item in the library uses this one is a frequent falsehood: you
cannot check those from here, so say so rather than passing them.

**Choice discipline matters in this wave.** Wave 5 is real analysis and general
topology: countability axioms, separation axioms, nets, filters, ultrafilters
and function spaces. Countable choice, dependent choice, the ultrafilter lemma
and full AC are genuinely different hypotheses here, and this library records
which one an argument spends. A proof that silently uses a choice principle its
Statement does not scope, or a Statement scoping a principle strictly stronger
or weaker than the proof actually needs, is a FATAL defect of the
missing-hypothesis class — not a quibble. Equally, the library has already
adopted AC, countable choice and dependent choice as foundational axioms, so
using one *within its declared scope* is not a defect.

## Output — the only thing you return

Plain markdown. For each finding, one block:

```
### FINDING 1, 2, 3, ... — FATAL or NONFATAL — location: title / Statement / [L#] / step X.Y / Remark
CLAIM AS WRITTEN: "<verbatim quote of the offending text>"
WHY IT FAILS: <the concrete false claim, unlicensed inference, missing
hypothesis, or inaccurate citation — with the verbatim dependency text that
does or does not license it>
WHAT WOULD FIX IT: <the smallest correction you can name, or "not obvious">
```

If, having genuinely tried to refute it, you find nothing fatal, say so plainly
and list what you checked. Finish with one line: `N fatal, M nonfatal`.

A confident empty reading is worse than useless here. Either name a concrete
defect with its quotation, or state clearly that you could not find one.

## Statement

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space carrying its metric topology
([[def-metric-topology]], [[def-metrizable-space]]), let $(Z, \mathcal{T}_Z)$ be
a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]), and give $X \times Z$ the
product topology ([[def-product-topology]]). Let $K \subseteq X$ be a compact
subset ([[def-metric-compactness]]), let $z_0 \in Z$, and let $N \subseteq X \times Z$
be open with

$$K \times \{z_0\} \;\subseteq\; N .$$

Then there is an open $W \subseteq Z$ with $z_0 \in W$ and

$$K \times W \;\subseteq\; N .$$

The set $K \times W$ is the **tube** of the name. The case $K = \varnothing$ is
included and is settled by $W = Z$. **No choice principle is used at all**: the
cover produced below is indexed by *pairs* of open sets, so the ambient form of
compactness returns the second entries together with the indices and nothing has
to be selected afterwards.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A metric space $(X,d)$ with its metric topology, a topological space $(Z,\mathcal{T}_Z)$, the product $X \times Z$ with the product topology, a compact $K \subseteq X$, a point $z_0 \in Z$ and an open $N \subseteq X \times Z$ with $K \times \{z_0\} \subseteq N$.

[A1] $K \times \{z_0\} \subseteq N$, that is $(a, z_0) \in N$ for every $a \in K$.

[L1] For a two-element index set the basic product-open sets are exactly the boxes: the sets $U \times W$ with $U$ open in $X$ and $W$ open in $Z$ form a basis for the product topology on $X \times Z$ ([[def-product-topology]], [[thm-basis-criterion]], [[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]).

[L2] $K$ is a compact subset of $X$ exactly when for every set $I$ and every family $(U_i)_{i \in I}$ of open subsets of $X$ with $K \subseteq \bigcup_{i \in I} U_i$ there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $i_0, \dots, i_n \in I$ with $K \subseteq U_{i_0} \cup \dots \cup U_{i_n}$, or else $K = \varnothing$ ([[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]], claim 3).

[L3] $Z$ is open in $Z$, and an intersection of finitely many open subsets of $Z$ is open ([[def-topological-space]], axioms (T1) and (T3) iterated).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 If $K = \varnothing$ then $K \times Z = \varnothing \subseteq N$ and $Z$ is an open set containing $z_0$, so $W := Z$ settles the claim; assume from here on that $K \ne \varnothing$. [L3, given]

1.2 Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the set of all pairs $(U, W)$ with $U$ open in $X$, $W$ open in $Z$, $z_0 \in W$ and $U \times W \subseteq N$; this is a set cut out by a property of the pair, and nothing is selected in forming it. [construct, L1]

2.1 The family $(U)_{(U,W) \in \mathcal{P}}$, indexed by $\mathcal{P}$ and assigning to each pair its first entry, is a family of open subsets of $X$ and it covers $K$: for $a \in K$ we have $(a,z_0) \in N$ by [A1], so by [L1] there are $U$ open in $X$ and $W$ open in $Z$ with $(a,z_0) \in U \times W \subseteq N$, and then $(U,W) \in \mathcal{P}$ with $a \in U$. [A1, L1, step 1.2]

3.1 Since $K \ne \varnothing$ is compact, there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and pairs $(U_0,W_0), \dots, (U_n,W_n) \in \mathcal{P}$ with $K \subseteq U_0 \cup \dots \cup U_n$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L2]

4.1 Each index returned by step 3.1 is itself a pair, so its second entry $W_j$ is given with it and nothing is chosen; put $W := W_0 \cap \dots \cap W_n$, which contains $z_0$ because every $W_j$ does, and is open in $Z$ as an intersection of $n+1 \ge 1$ open sets. [step 3.1, L3]

5.1 $K \times W \subseteq N$: given $a \in K$ and $z \in W$, step 3.1 gives $j \le n$ with $a \in U_j$, and $z \in W \subseteq W_j$, so $(a,z) \in U_j \times W_j \subseteq N$ by the defining property of $\mathcal{P}$. [step 1.2, step 3.1, step 4.1]

6.1 Steps 4.1 and 5.1 exhibit an open $W \ni z_0$ with $K \times W \subseteq N$, which with step 1.1 proves the lemma in both cases. [step 1.1, step 4.1, step 5.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the pairs and not the open sets.** A single open $U \subseteq X$ may be the first entry of many admissible pairs, and recovering a suitable $W$ from $U$ alone would be a selection over an infinite family. Indexing the cover by the *pairs* rather than by the sets is what makes the second entries come back with the indices, and it is the same device the ambient form of compactness uses ([[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]]).

- **Compactness of the metric factor is what the lemma is about.** No hypothesis whatever is placed on $Z$, and none is needed: the finite intersection of the $W_j$ is taken in $Z$ and uses only axiom (T3). What compactness of $K$ buys is that finitely many boxes already cover the slice $K \times \{z_0\}$, so that finitely many second entries have to be intersected.

- **The hypothesis cannot be moved to the other factor.** With $K$ replaced by a non-compact set the conclusion fails: the region under the graph of a positive function tending to $0$ contains a whole slice and no tube around it. Nothing on this page needs that witness, and it is not constructed here.

- **The general tube lemma, for a compact factor in an arbitrary topological product, is now available in this library, on an earlier page** ([[lem-tube-lemma-for-a-compact-factor]]). The proof above is the metric special case of that general lemma, narrowed to a metric factor $X$ and written independently of it: nothing above cites the general statement, and nothing needs to, since compactness of a metric-space subset is the same notion under either reading ([[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]]).

### `def-metric-compactness` — definition — Open cover, subcover, compact metric space, and compact subset of a metric space

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]), with open sets as in
[[def-metric-topology]] and balls as in [[def-metric-ball]].

- An **open cover** of $(X,d)$ is a family $\mathcal{U}$ of open subsets of $X$
  with $X = \bigcup \mathcal{U}$, where
  $\bigcup \mathcal{U} = \{\, x \in X : x \in U \text{ for some } U \in \mathcal{U} \,\}$.
- A **subcover** of $\mathcal{U}$ is a subfamily
  $\mathcal{V} \subseteq \mathcal{U}$ that is itself an open cover.
- A family $\mathcal{V}$ of sets is **finite** when $\mathcal{V} = \emptyset$ or
  there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and sets $V_0, \dots, V_n$ with
  $\mathcal{V} = \{V_0, \dots, V_n\}$; repetitions in the list are allowed and
  harmless.
- $(X,d)$ is **compact** when every open cover of it has a finite subcover: for
  every open cover $\mathcal{U}$, either $X = \emptyset$ and the empty subfamily
  covers it, or there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
  $U_0, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{U}$ with
  $$X = U_0 \cup \dots \cup U_n .$$
- A subset $A \subseteq X$ is a **compact subset** of $X$ when the metric
  subspace $(A, d_A)$ is a compact metric space, $d_A$ being the restriction of
  $d$ to $A \times A$ ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]).

**Compactness of a subset is defined intrinsically, and only intrinsically.**
The last clause speaks about the subspace $(A,d_A)$ and its own open sets, not
about families of open subsets of the ambient $X$. The two readings do agree,
but that is a theorem and not a convention: it is
[[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]], and no item of this library may use the
ambient reading without citing it. Taking the intrinsic reading as the
definition is what makes "compact" a property of the metric space $(A,d_A)$
alone, so that a set compact in one ambient space is compact in every other one
containing it isometrically.

**The empty space is compact**, since the empty subfamily of any family covers
it; this is the reason the clause above is written with the two cases. The
one-point space is compact too, and so is every space listed as
$\{x_0, \dots, x_n\}$: given a cover, each $x_i$ lies in some member, and
finitely many members chosen in this way already cover.

**The finiteness convention, and how it is used both ways.** "Finite" above is
the listing form, matching the finite lists of
[[def-finite-intersection-property]]. It agrees with the definition of
finiteness by equinumerosity with a natural number ([[def-countable]]), and
both directions of the agreement are available and are used below:

- A nonempty finite set $F$ in the sense of [[def-countable]] satisfies
  $F \approx m$ for some $m \ge 1$, and a bijection $m \to F$ is exactly a
  listing $F = \{a_0, \dots, a_{m-1}\}$.
- Conversely a set listed as $A = \{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$, that is the image of a
  function $a$ with domain $\sigma(n)$, is finite in the sense of
  [[def-countable]]: the map sending $x \in A$ to the least $i \le n$ with
  $a_i = x$ is an injection of $A$ into $\sigma(n)$, so $A$ is equinumerous with
  a subset of $\mathbb{N}$ bounded above, and such a subset is finite
  ([[lem-subset-of-countable]]).

Neither direction uses a choice principle: the second selects nothing, taking a
least index instead.

### `lem-compactness-is-intrinsic` — lemma — A subset of a metric space is open in the subspace metric exactly when it is the trace of an open set of the ambient space, and it is compact as a metric space in its own right exactly when every family of open subsets of the ambient space covering it, indexed or not, has finitely many members covering it

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]), let $A \subseteq X$ and let
$(A,d_A)$ be the metric subspace ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]). Then:

1. **Relative openness is a trace.** A set $V \subseteq A$ is open in $(A,d_A)$
   ([[def-metric-topology]]) if and only if $V = U \cap A$ for some $U$ open in
   $(X,d)$.
2. **Compactness read in the ambient space.** $A$ is a compact subset of $X$
   ([[def-metric-compactness]]), that is $(A,d_A)$ is a compact metric space, if
   and only if for every family $\mathcal{U}$ of open subsets of $X$ with
   $A \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{U}$ there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
   $U_0, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{U}$ with $A \subseteq U_0 \cup \dots \cup U_n$,
   or else $A = \emptyset$.
3. **The same in indexed form.** $A$ is a compact subset of $X$ if and only if
   for every set $I$ and every family $(U_i)_{i \in I}$ of open subsets of $X$
   with $A \subseteq \bigcup_{i \in I} U_i$ there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
   indices $i_0, \dots, i_n \in I$ with
   $A \subseteq U_{i_0} \cup \dots \cup U_{i_n}$, or else $A = \emptyset$.

Claim 3 is the form used by almost every later proof on this page, because a
cover is usually produced by a rule that attaches an open set to each point or to
each index, and a set of open sets forgets that rule. No choice principle is used
anywhere below; the one place a selection is made is over a finite index set, and
[[lem-finite-choice]] is a theorem of ZF.

### `def-product-topology` — definition — The product set $\\prod_{i \\in I} X_i$ of functions choosing a point in each factor, the projections, the box topology, and the product topology as the initial topology of the projections; the empty product is a one-point space

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

**The product set.** Let $I$ be a set and let $X_i$ be a set for each $i \in I$.
The **product** is

$$\prod_{i \in I} X_i \;:=\; \Big\{\, x : x \text{ is a function with domain } I \text{ and } x(i) \in X_i \text{ for every } i \in I \,\Big\},$$

and we write $x_i := x(i)$, the $i$-th **coordinate** of $x$. Two elements of the
product are equal exactly when they agree at every index, functions being equal
when they have the same domain and the same values. For $j \in I$ the $j$-th
**projection** is

$$\pi_j : \prod_{i \in I} X_i \to X_j, \qquad \pi_j(x) := x_j .$$

**Notation for a finite product.** For $I = n$ a natural number, which is the set
$\{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ of its predecessors, an element of $\prod_{k<n} X_k$ is a
function on $n$ and we write it $(x_0, \dots, x_{n-1})$. In particular $I = 2$
gives the **binary product**, written $X \times Y$ for $\prod_{i<2} X_i$ with
$X_0 = X$ and $X_1 = Y$, whose elements are written $(u,v)$ for the function
$0 \mapsto u$, $1 \mapsto v$. This is the only meaning the symbol $X \times Y$
carries on this page.

**Two facts about when the product is nonempty, stated because they are used and
because they cost something.** If some $X_{i_0}$ is empty then the product is
empty, since no function can take a value in $X_{i_0}$. Conversely, suppose every
$X_i$ is nonempty.

- For $I = n$ a natural number, the product is nonempty, and this is a theorem of
  ZF: [[lem-finite-choice]] applied to the function $i \mapsto X_i$ on $n$
  supplies a choice function $g$ for the family of values, and
  $x(i) := g(X_i)$ defines a member of $\prod_{k<n} X_k$.
- For an arbitrary $I$ the assertion "$\prod_{i \in I} X_i \ne \varnothing$
  whenever every $X_i$ is nonempty" **is** the Axiom of Choice: it is the
  formulation recorded in [[def-axiom-of-choice]], and the choice function of
  [[def-choice-function]] is exactly a point of the product of a family by
  itself. Every use of it below is flagged at the step that spends it.

**The box topology.** Now let each $X_i$ carry a topology $\mathcal{T}_i$
([[def-topological-space]]). Put

$$\mathcal{R} \;:=\; \Big\{\, \prod_{i \in I} U_i \;:\; U_i \in \mathcal{T}_i \text{ for every } i \in I \,\Big\},$$

the family of **boxes**. $\mathcal{R}$ is a basis for a topology
([[thm-basis-criterion]]): it contains $\prod_i X_i$, so it covers the product,
and it is closed under binary intersections, since

$$\Big(\prod_i U_i\Big) \cap \Big(\prod_i V_i\Big) = \prod_i (U_i \cap V_i)$$

and each $U_i \cap V_i$ is open by (T3). The topology it generates is the **box
topology** $\mathcal{T}^{\square}$, and $\mathcal{R}$ is a basis for it
([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]).

**The product topology.** The **product topology** $\mathcal{T}^{\Pi}$ on
$\prod_i X_i$ is the initial topology of the family of projections
$(\pi_i)_{i \in I}$ ([[def-initial-and-final-topology]]): the topology generated
by the subbasis

$$\mathcal{G} \;:=\; \{\, \pi_i^{-1}[U] : i \in I,\ U \in \mathcal{T}_i \,\}, \qquad \pi_i^{-1}[U] = \prod_{j \in I} W_j \ \text{ with } W_i = U \text{ and } W_j = X_j \text{ for } j \ne i .$$

By [[thm-basis-criterion]] the finite intersections of members of $\mathcal{G}$
form a basis for $\mathcal{T}^{\Pi}$, and those finite intersections are exactly
the boxes with all but finitely many factors unrestricted:

$$\mathcal{R}^{\Pi} \;=\; \Big\{\, \prod_{i \in I} U_i \;:\; U_i \in \mathcal{T}_i \text{ for every } i, \text{ and } U_i = X_i \text{ for all but finitely many } i \,\Big\}.$$

Indeed the intersection of $\pi_{i_1}^{-1}[U_1], \dots, \pi_{i_n}^{-1}[U_n]$ is
the box whose factor at $i$ is the intersection of those $U_m$ with $i_m = i$ and
is $X_i$ when no $i_m$ equals $i$; and the intersection of no members is the
whole product, the box with every factor $X_i$. Conversely a box with
$U_i = X_i$ off a finite set is such an intersection. Members of
$\mathcal{R}^{\Pi}$ are called **basic product-open** sets, and members of
$\mathcal{R}$ **boxes**. So $\mathcal{R}^{\Pi} \subseteq \mathcal{R}$, with
equality when $I$ is a natural number.

**The empty product.** For $I = \varnothing$ there is exactly one function with
domain $\varnothing$, the empty function, so $\prod_{i \in \varnothing} X_i$ is a
one-point set. A one-point set carries exactly one topology, namely
$\{\varnothing, \{\varnothing\}\}$, since a topology must contain the empty set
and the whole set and there is nothing else to contain
([[def-topological-space]]); so the box topology and the product topology agree
there, and both equal the discrete topology and the indiscrete topology
([[def-standard-topologies]]), which coincide on a one-point set. There are no
projections to speak of, and the initial topology of the empty family is indeed
the indiscrete one ([[def-initial-and-final-topology]]).

**Convention.** Unless the box topology is named explicitly, $\prod_i X_i$ always
carries the product topology in this library. That is not a matter of taste: the
product topology is the one with the characteristic property of the next item,
and the box topology has no such property.

### `def-metric-topology` — definition — The metric topology: a set is open when every one of its points has a ball around it inside the set; closed means open complement

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]).

A subset $U \subseteq X$ is **open in $(X,d)$** if for every $x \in U$ there is a
real $r > 0$ with $B(x,r) \subseteq U$ ([[def-metric-ball]]). A subset
$F \subseteq X$ is **closed in $(X,d)$** if its complement $X \setminus F$ is
open.

The collection

$$\mathcal{T}_d := \{\, U \subseteq X : U \text{ is open in } (X,d) \,\}$$

of all open subsets is the **metric topology** of $d$ on $X$. A subset of $X$
that is both open and closed is called **clopen**.

**Two sets are open for trivial reasons.** $\emptyset$ is open, because the
defining condition quantifies over no points; and $X$ is open, because
$B(x,r) \subseteq X$ for every $x$ and every $r > 0$. Consequently $X$ and
$\emptyset$ are also closed, and both are clopen.

**A neighbourhood of a point $x$** is any open set containing $x$. The condition
above therefore reads: $U$ is open exactly when every point of $U$ has a ball
around it inside $U$, and it is the balls alone that have to be tested.

**The metric, not the set, determines $\mathcal{T}_d$.** Two metrics on the same
set may have different metric topologies, and two different metrics may have the
same one; the systematic comparison is [[def-equivalent-metrics]].

### `def-metrizable-space` — definition — Metrizable space: a topological space whose topology is induced by some metric; metrizability is topological, the metric is not

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ ([[def-topological-space]]) is
**metrizable** if there is a metric $d$ on $X$ ([[def-metric-space]]) whose
metric topology is $\mathcal{T}$, that is $\mathcal{T} = \mathcal{T}_d$
([[def-metric-topology]]). Such a $d$ is said to **induce** or **metrise**
$\mathcal{T}$.

**The definition presupposes that $\mathcal{T}_d$ is a topology in the sense of
[[def-topological-space]], and it is.** By [[def-metric-topology]] both
$\varnothing$ and $X$ are open in $(X,d)$, which is (T1), and by
[[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]] the family $\mathcal{T}_d$ is closed under
arbitrary unions, which is (T2), and under intersections of $n \ge 1$ members,
which contains (T3). So every metric space is a topological space, and the
metric-space development of this library is a special case of the present one.

**The standard local notions in the two developments agree after translating
their neighbourhood conventions.** Let $d$ be a metric on $X$ and give $X$ the
topology $\mathcal{T}_d$.

- *Neighbourhoods and balls.* [[def-metric-topology]] uses "neighbourhood" for
  an open set containing $x$, whereas [[def-neighbourhood-top]] also allows a
  non-open superset of such a set. Thus the two collections are not literally
  equal, but the open metric neighbourhoods are cofinal in the broader
  neighbourhood filter. The balls $B(x,r)$, $r > 0$ ([[def-metric-ball]]), are
  open ([[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]]) and form a neighbourhood base at $x$:
  any neighbourhood $N$ contains an open $U \ni x$, hence a ball around $x$ by
  [[def-metric-topology]]. The balls of radius $1/n$ alone already suffice
  ([[lem-metric-ball-neighbourhood-base]]).
- *Interior, closure, boundary.* [[def-metric-interior-closure-boundary]] defines
  them by the same conditions with balls in place of neighbourhoods, and the
  previous bullet makes the two conditions equivalent; the metric closure is the
  smallest closed superset ([[thm-metric-closure-characterisation]]), which is the
  definition used here ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]). So the two
  closures, the two interiors and the two boundaries are the same three
  operations.
- *Convergence.* $x_k \to p$ in the sense of [[def-sequence-convergence-top]] is
  "eventually in every neighbourhood of $p$", and by the first bullet this is
  "eventually in every ball around $p$", which is [[def-metric-convergence]].
- *Continuity.* $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ continuity at $a$
  ([[def-metric-continuity]]) says that every ball around $f(a)$ has a ball
  around $a$ mapped into it, which by the first bullet is continuity at $a$ in
  the sense of [[def-continuous-map-top]].

- *Subspaces.* For $A \subseteq X$ the subspace topology
  $\{\, U \cap A : U \in \mathcal{T}_d \,\}$ of [[def-subspace-topology-top]] is
  exactly the metric topology of the subspace metric $d_A$
  ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]), so the two uses of the phrase
  *subspace topology* in this library name one thing. Indeed
  $B_A(a,r) = B_X(a,r) \cap A$: a trace $U \cap A$ is $d_A$-open, since each of
  its points $a$ has $B_X(a,r) \subseteq U$ and hence $B_A(a,r) \subseteq U \cap A$;
  and a $d_A$-open $W$ is the trace of
  $U := \bigcup \{\, B_X(a,r) : a \in W,\ r > 0,\ B_X(a,r) \cap A \subseteq W \,\}$,
  which is $d_X$-open, satisfies $U \cap A = W$, and involves no choice principle,
  the union being taken over a set of pairs rather than over a selection.

Consequently the metric-space notions of interior, closure, boundary, density,
convergence, continuity and subspace agree with the topological notions here,
and statements about them transfer once a metric is named. For neighbourhoods
the transfer uses the explicit convention change above: a metric-page
neighbourhood is an open topological neighbourhood, while every topological
neighbourhood contains one.

**Metrizability is a topological property; the metric is not part of it.** If
$h : X \to Y$ is a homeomorphism ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]) and $d$
metrises $X$, then $d'(y_1,y_2) := d(h^{-1}(y_1), h^{-1}(y_2))$ is a metric on
$Y$ — the three axioms transfer along the bijection $h^{-1}$ — and
$h[B_d(x,r)] = B_{d'}(h(x), r)$, so $h$ carries a basis of $\mathcal{T}_d$ to a
basis of $\mathcal{T}_{d'}$ and $\mathcal{T}_{d'} = h[\mathcal{T}_d] = \mathcal{T}_Y$.
Hence $Y$ is metrizable. The metric itself, however, is **not** determined by the
topology: two metrics on one set may induce the same topology without agreeing,
which is exactly topological equivalence ([[def-equivalent-metrics]]), and
properties of a metric that are not properties of its topology, boundedness among
them, are therefore not properties of a metrizable space.

**Two things every metrizable space has.** It is **Hausdorff**: distinct points
have disjoint open neighbourhoods, by [[thm-metric-hausdorff-separation]] applied
to any metric inducing the topology. And it is **first countable**
([[def-first-countable-top]]), by [[lem-metric-ball-neighbourhood-base]]. Either
failure is therefore an obstruction to metrizability, and this page uses the
first of them to exhibit a topology induced by no metric.

**Sequential limits in a metrizable space are unique, so the notation
$\lim_k x_k$ is available there.** In a metric space a sequence has at most one
limit ([[lem-metric-limits-unique]]), and by the agreement of convergence above
that uniqueness is a statement about the topology alone; so within a metrizable
space, and only there, this page writes $\lim_k x_k$ in the ordinary way. In a
general space the symbol is unavailable ([[def-sequence-convergence-top]]).

**The usual topology of $\mathbb{R}$.** The absolute value makes $\mathbb{R}$ a
metric space under $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) = |x-y|$, its open balls are the bounded
open intervals, and the resulting metric topology is what claim 3 of
[[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]] names the **usual topology** of $\mathbb{R}$.
That is the topology meant by the phrase throughout these two pages, and
$\mathbb{R}$ carrying it is metrizable by definition. Every statement about it on
these two pages is proved from the metric $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ and the bridge above,
and no example re-derives any of it.

### `def-topological-space` — definition — Topology on a set, open and closed sets, clopen sets, the closed-set axiomatisation, and the coarser/finer comparison

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $X$ be a set and write $\mathcal{P}(X)$ for its power set. A **topology** on
$X$ is a family $\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ such that

- **(T1)** $\varnothing \in \mathcal{T}$ and $X \in \mathcal{T}$;
- **(T2)** $\bigcup \mathcal{S} \in \mathcal{T}$ for every $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$;
- **(T3)** $U \cap V \in \mathcal{T}$ for all $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$.

A **topological space** is a pair $(X, \mathcal{T})$ consisting of a set $X$ and
a topology $\mathcal{T}$ on it; the elements of $X$ are its **points**. When only
one topology is in play we write $X$ for the pair; when several are, the topology
is always named.

The members of $\mathcal{T}$ are the **open** sets of $(X,\mathcal{T})$. A subset
$F \subseteq X$ is **closed** when its complement $X \setminus F$ is open, and
**clopen** when it is both open and closed. By (T1) both $\varnothing$ and $X$
are clopen. *Open and closed are not opposites*: a set may be neither, and it may
be both, so "not open" is never a synonym for "closed".

**Finite intersections, and the empty one.** Axiom (T3) is stated for two sets
because that is all that is ever needed: if $n \ge 1$ and
$U_1, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{T}$, then $U_1 \cap \dots \cap U_n \in \mathcal{T}$
follows by iterating (T3) $n-1$ times. The intersection of the **empty** family
of subsets of $X$ is $X$, since the condition "lies in every member of the empty
family" is vacuous; that case is covered by (T1) rather than by (T3), which is
one of the two reasons $X \in \mathcal{T}$ is demanded outright. The other is
that (T2) alone gives only $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$.

**The closed sets, and the dual axiomatisation.** Put
$\mathcal{C} := \{\, X \setminus U : U \in \mathcal{T} \,\}$, the family of closed
sets. Then

- **(C1)** $\varnothing \in \mathcal{C}$ and $X \in \mathcal{C}$;
- **(C2)** $\bigcap \mathcal{D} \in \mathcal{C}$ for every **nonempty**
  $\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$;
- **(C3)** $C \cup D \in \mathcal{C}$ for all $C, D \in \mathcal{C}$.

Conversely, if a family $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ satisfies (C1),
(C2) and (C3), then $\mathcal{T} := \{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{C} \,\}$
is a topology on $X$ whose closed sets are exactly the members of $\mathcal{C}$.
So a topology may be presented equally well by its open sets or by its closed
sets, and this library uses whichever is shorter.

*Both directions are one computation, and it is carried out here rather than
assumed.* The map $U \mapsto X \setminus U$ is an involution of
$\mathcal{P}(X)$, hence a bijection, and it carries the two De Morgan identities

$$X \setminus \bigcup_{i \in I} A_i = \bigcap_{i \in I} (X \setminus A_i) \quad (I \ne \varnothing), \qquad X \setminus \bigcap_{i \in I} A_i = \bigcup_{i \in I} (X \setminus A_i) \quad (I \ne \varnothing)$$

term by term into each other. Given (T1)–(T3): $\varnothing = X \setminus X$ and
$X = X \setminus \varnothing$ lie in $\mathcal{C}$, which is (C1); for nonempty
$\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$ the family
$\mathcal{S} = \{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{D} \,\}$ lies in $\mathcal{T}$
and $\bigcap \mathcal{D} = X \setminus \bigcup \mathcal{S}$ is closed by (T2),
which is (C2); and $C \cup D = X \setminus ((X \setminus C) \cap (X \setminus D))$
is closed by (T3), which is (C3). Given (C1)–(C3) the same three lines run
backwards, the empty-union case $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$ being supplied
by (C1) rather than by (C2); and $\{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{C} \,\}$ has
$\mathcal{C}$ as its family of complements because complementation is an
involution.

**Comparison of topologies.** If $\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ are
topologies on the same set $X$ and $\mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2$, then
$\mathcal{T}_1$ is **coarser** than $\mathcal{T}_2$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ is
**finer** than $\mathcal{T}_1$; the comparison is **strict** when the inclusion
is. Inclusion is a partial order on the set of topologies on $X$
([[def-partial-order]]), and it is not a total one: two topologies on the same
set may be incomparable.

### `def-topology-basis-subbasis` — definition — Basis and subbasis for a topology, and the topology generated by a family of sets

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]).

A family $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$ is a **basis for $\mathcal{T}$** if
every open set is a union of members of $\mathcal{B}$: for every
$U \in \mathcal{T}$ there is $\mathcal{B}_U \subseteq \mathcal{B}$ with
$U = \bigcup \mathcal{B}_U$. Equivalently, and this is the form used in proofs,

$$\text{for every } U \in \mathcal{T} \text{ and every } x \in U \text{ there is } B \in \mathcal{B} \text{ with } x \in B \subseteq U .$$

*The two forms say the same thing.* If every open $U$ is such a union and
$x \in U$, then $x$ lies in one of the sets united, which is a member of
$\mathcal{B}$ inside $U$. Conversely, if the displayed condition holds then
$U = \bigcup \{\, B \in \mathcal{B} : B \subseteq U \,\}$, since each such $B$ is
contained in $U$ and each $x \in U$ lies in one of them. Note that
$\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$, so the empty open set is covered by the empty
subfamily and needs no member of $\mathcal{B}$. The members of a basis are called
**basic open sets**.

**The topology generated by a family.** Let $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$
be *any* family of subsets of $X$. Then

$$\langle \mathcal{S} \rangle := \bigcap \{\, \mathcal{T}' : \mathcal{T}' \text{ is a topology on } X \text{ with } \mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{T}' \,\}$$

is a topology on $X$, it contains $\mathcal{S}$, and it is contained in every
topology on $X$ that contains $\mathcal{S}$. It is called the **topology
generated by $\mathcal{S}$**, and $\mathcal{S}$ is a **subbasis** for a topology
$\mathcal{T}$ when $\mathcal{T} = \langle \mathcal{S} \rangle$.

*This is well posed, and the obligation is discharged here.* The collection being
intersected is nonempty, because $\mathcal{P}(X)$ is a topology on $X$ containing
$\mathcal{S}$; so the intersection is an intersection of a nonempty family of
subsets of $\mathcal{P}(X)$ and is a set. It is a topology: $\varnothing$ and $X$
lie in every topology on $X$, hence in the intersection, which is (T1); if
$\mathcal{S}' \subseteq \langle \mathcal{S} \rangle$ then $\mathcal{S}'$ is a
subfamily of each $\mathcal{T}'$ in the collection, so $\bigcup \mathcal{S}'$ lies
in each $\mathcal{T}'$ and hence in the intersection, which is (T2); and the same
argument with $U \cap V$ gives (T3). It contains $\mathcal{S}$ because every
$\mathcal{T}'$ in the collection does, and it is contained in each such
$\mathcal{T}'$ because an intersection is contained in each of its members. So
$\langle \mathcal{S} \rangle$ is the coarsest topology on $X$ containing
$\mathcal{S}$ ([[def-topological-space]]), and in particular it is uniquely
determined by $\mathcal{S}$.

**Neither notion is intrinsic to the family alone.** "$\mathcal{B}$ is a basis
for $\mathcal{T}$" and "$\mathcal{S}$ is a subbasis for $\mathcal{T}$" are
relations between a family and a topology, not properties of the family. The
question of which families are a basis *for some* topology, and how the topology
generated by a subbasis is computed from it, is settled by the next item.

### `thm-basis-criterion` — theorem — A family is a basis for a unique topology iff it covers the set and every point of an intersection of two members lies in a member inside that intersection; finite intersections of any subbasis form a basis

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $X$ be a set, and for $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ write

$$\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{B}} := \{\, U \subseteq X : \text{for every } x \in U \text{ there is } B \in \mathcal{B} \text{ with } x \in B \subseteq U \,\} .$$

1. $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for some topology on $X$ ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]])
   if and only if

   - **(B1)** $\bigcup \mathcal{B} = X$, and
   - **(B2)** for all $B_1, B_2 \in \mathcal{B}$ and every $x \in B_1 \cap B_2$
     there is $B_3 \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B_3 \subseteq B_1 \cap B_2$.

   When (B1) and (B2) hold, that topology is **unique**: it is
   $\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{B}}$, which is also exactly the family of all unions of
   subfamilies of $\mathcal{B}$.

2. Let $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ be an arbitrary family and let
   $\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S}}$ be the family of intersections of finitely many
   members of $\mathcal{S}$. Then $\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S}}$ satisfies (B1) and
   (B2), and $\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S}}} = \langle \mathcal{S} \rangle$,
   the topology generated by $\mathcal{S}$. So the finite intersections of any
   subbasis form a basis for the topology it generates.

**The nullary intersection: this library takes the empty intersection to be $X$.**
In claim 2 the phrase "finitely many" includes **none**, and the intersection of
the empty subfamily of $\mathcal{S}$ is $X$, because the defining condition "lies
in every member of the empty family" holds of every point of $X$. Hence
$X \in \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S}}$ for every $\mathcal{S}$, including
$\mathcal{S} = \varnothing$, and **no covering hypothesis is imposed on a
subbasis**. The competing convention takes only nonempty finite intersections and
compensates by requiring $\bigcup \mathcal{S} = X$; under it claim 2 holds
verbatim once that hypothesis is added, and the two conventions differ only in
which of the two devices supplies (B1). The choice made here is recorded again
among this page's conventions, and it is the reason
$\langle \varnothing \rangle$ comes out as the indiscrete topology
$\{\varnothing, X\}$ rather than being undefined.

### `def-metric-space` — definition — Metric space: $d(x,y) = 0$ iff $x = y$, symmetry, and the triangle inequality; pseudometric and ultrametric

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) constructed in this
library ([[def-real-numbers]]) and carrying its order ([[def-real-order]]).

Let $X$ be a set. A **metric** on $X$ is a function
$d : X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $x, y, z \in X$:

- **(M1) Separation.** $d(x,y) = 0$ if and only if $x = y$.
- **(M2) Symmetry.** $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$.
- **(M3) Triangle inequality.** $d(x,z) \le d(x,y) + d(y,z)$.

A **metric space** is a pair $(X,d)$ consisting of a set $X$ and a metric $d$ on
it. The elements of $X$ are its **points** and $d(x,y)$ is the **distance** from
$x$ to $y$. When only one metric is in play we write $X$ for $(X,d)$; when
several are, the metric is always named.

**The values of a metric are real numbers.** The codomain is $\mathbb{R}$, so
$d(x,y)$ is an honest element of the complete ordered field and every
inequality above is an inequality there. No infinite value is permitted;
[[rem-metric-axiom-conventions]] records why extended metrics are not treated in
this library.

**Nonnegativity is deliberately absent from the axiom list.** Many texts add a
fourth axiom $d(x,y) \ge 0$. It is redundant: (M1), (M2) and (M3) already force
it, as [[lem-metric-nonnegativity]] proves. Nothing below assumes it before that
lemma is available.

**Pseudometric.** A **pseudometric** on $X$ is a function
$p : X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying (M2), (M3) and the weakening

- **(M1') Reflexivity.** $p(x,x) = 0$ for every $x \in X$

of (M1). A pseudometric may therefore assign distance $0$ to two distinct
points. Every metric is a pseudometric, and a pseudometric is a metric exactly
when $p(x,y) = 0$ forces $x = y$.

**Ultrametric.** An **ultrametric** on $X$ is a metric $d$ that in addition
satisfies

- **(M3') Strong triangle inequality.** $d(x,z) \le \max\{d(x,y), d(y,z)\}$

for all $x, y, z \in X$, where the maximum is that of a two-element subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, which exists and is one of the two elements
([[def-max-min]], [[lem-finite-set-has-max]]). An **ultrametric space** is a pair
$(X,d)$ with $d$ an ultrametric.

### `lem-tube-lemma-for-a-compact-factor` — lemma — Tube lemma: if $K$ is compact and an open $N \\subseteq X \\times Z$ contains $K \\times \\{z_0\\}$, then $N$ contains $K \\times W$ for some open $W \\ni z_0$

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Z, \mathcal{T}_Z)$ be topological spaces
([[def-topological-space]]) and give $X \times Z$ the product topology
([[def-product-topology]]). Let $K \subseteq X$ be a compact subset
([[def-compact-space]]), let $z_0 \in Z$, and let $N \subseteq X \times Z$ be open
with

$$K \times \{z_0\} \;\subseteq\; N .$$

Then there is an open $W \subseteq Z$ with $z_0 \in W$ and

$$K \times W \;\subseteq\; N .$$

The set $K \times W$ is the **tube** of the name. The case $K = \varnothing$ is
included and is settled by $W = Z$. **No choice principle is used at all**: the
cover produced below is indexed by *pairs* of open sets, so the indexed form of
the ambient compactness criterion ([[lem-compactness-of-a-subspace-is-ambient]],
claim 2) returns the second entries together with the indices and nothing has to
be selected afterwards.
