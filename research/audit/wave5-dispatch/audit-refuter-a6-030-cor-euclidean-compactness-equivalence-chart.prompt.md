# Wave 5 audit — A6 adversarial proof reading

You are a **read-only adversarial reader** (DeepSeek V4 Pro, max reasoning)
dispatched by the wave-5 audit Alpha of the prestige-math-library published-page
retro-audit (`AUDIT-WORKFLOW.md` step A6). You return **evidence, never edits**,
and you never propose to apply anything yourself. Alpha alone adjudicates.

> **NO SHELL-PERMISSION PROMPTS (owner, 2026-07-30) — binding on every current
> and future agent.** Never ask the owner to approve a command. You have no
> shell at all, so this is automatic for you; it is stated here because the rule
> binds every agent in this workflow verbatim.

**You have no tools and no filesystem.** Everything you are to read is in this
prompt: the item under review in full, and the Statement or Definition text of
every dependency it declares, quoted verbatim from disk. Do not speculate about
text you were not given — if a decision genuinely turns on something absent,
say so explicitly and name what is missing rather than assuming its content.

**Why you specifically.** The audit-side lineup is otherwise entirely Claude:
the Beta that read and retagged these items, the Alpha adjudicating them, and
the certifier reading repairs are all Claude models, and much of this legacy
corpus was Claude-authored too. **You are the only cross-family reader in the
loop.** A shared blind spot among the Claude readers will not show up as
disagreement among them; it can only show up as you finding something they did
not. Do not defer to the fact that a published item has already passed several
readings — this audit has repeatedly confirmed fatal defects in text that had.

**This is a retro-audit of ALREADY-PUBLISHED pages.** The item in front of you
was written, gated, judged and published months ago. Nothing about that history
is evidence that it is correct; it is the reason nobody has re-read it
adversarially since. Wave 3 measured 6 of its 11 confirmed fatal defects in
items the audit had left byte-identical.

## Your standard — the judges' standard

Read every proof step and every cited dependency as someone trying to REFUTE the
item. The point of this audit is to find what is actually wrong, not to confirm
the text reads well.

Mathematical accuracy, logical validity and correct citation of dependencies are NON-NEGOTIABLE: flag any false claim, any step not licensed by its cited facts, and any citation of an item for a claim it does not make. EXPLICITLY ACCEPTABLE, do not flag: minor citational quirks; logical gaps between proof steps that a competent reader closes within 30 SECONDS; other non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter. Library conventions that are NOT defects: sequences are functions on N and N CONTAINS 0, so indices start at 0; a natural number is a von Neumann natural (a set), so 1/k is written 1/iota(k) with iota the canonical natural of the field; the successor of a von Neumann natural n is sigma(n) = n union {n}, so n = {0,1,...,n-1} and sigma(n) = {0,1,...,n} has exactly n+1 elements; sigma(n) is NOT {0,...,n-1}, and an off-by-one objection that rests on reading it that way is a misreading of the library, not a defect; items cite by [L#] into a Facts and Assumptions block; a definition may discharge its own well-definedness inline or via justified_by. Also check the TITLE against what is actually proved: a title asserting more than the proof gives is a defect even when the Statement is correct. CITATION VOICE AND FIDELITY: every [F#], [A#], and [L#] fact must state the cited Definition or Statement itself, exactly when practical or in a concise version preserving its domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, conclusion, and direction.

## Triage — the standing rule, binding

- **Non-negotiable, always report:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity,
  correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort and do NOT report:** minor citational
  quirks; logical gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other
  non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter; prose style; page
  summary length; missing provenance URLs.

**Before alleging a cited dependency is too weak, quote the dependency text you
were given and show exactly what it fails to supply.** A refuter that asserts a
dependency is insufficient without quoting it is producing noise, and this
library's dominant real defect class — a citation of an item for a claim it does
not make — can only be established by that quotation.

**Read the Remarks with a numbered step's suspicion.** Measured across this
audit, Remark and Facts-block prose, not numbered steps, is where nearly every
confirmed fatal defect in this corpus has been found. A Remark that asserts how
some *other* item in the library uses this one is a frequent falsehood: you
cannot check those from here, so say so rather than passing them.

**Choice discipline matters in this wave.** Wave 5 is real analysis and general
topology: countability axioms, separation axioms, nets, filters, ultrafilters
and function spaces. Countable choice, dependent choice, the ultrafilter lemma
and full AC are genuinely different hypotheses here, and this library records
which one an argument spends. A proof that silently uses a choice principle its
Statement does not scope, or a Statement scoping a principle strictly stronger
or weaker than the proof actually needs, is a FATAL defect of the
missing-hypothesis class — not a quibble. Equally, the library has already
adopted AC, countable choice and dependent choice as foundational axioms, so
using one *within its declared scope* is not a defect.

## Output — the only thing you return

Plain markdown. For each finding, one block:

```
### FINDING 1, 2, 3, ... — FATAL or NONFATAL — location: title / Statement / [L#] / step X.Y / Remark
CLAIM AS WRITTEN: "<verbatim quote of the offending text>"
WHY IT FAILS: <the concrete false claim, unlicensed inference, missing
hypothesis, or inaccurate citation — with the verbatim dependency text that
does or does not license it>
WHAT WOULD FIX IT: <the smallest correction you can name, or "not obvious">
```

If, having genuinely tried to refute it, you find nothing fatal, say so plainly
and list what you checked. Finish with one line: `N fatal, M nonfatal`.

A confident empty reading is worse than useless here. Either name a concrete
defect with its quotation, or state clearly that you could not find one.

## Statement

Assume $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ and $\mathrm{DC}$. If $n\ge1$ and $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ is nonempty, then the following conditions are equivalent: compactness; closedness and boundedness; pseudocompactness; attainment of a maximum and minimum by every continuous $A\to\mathbb{R}$; countable compactness; sequential compactness; limit point compactness; and completeness together with total boundedness.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ ([[def-countable-choice]]), $\mathrm{DC}$ ([[def-dependent-choice]]), an integer $n\ge1$, and a nonempty Euclidean subset $A$.

[L1] The four Euclidean conditions compactness, closedness and boundedness, pseudocompactness, and the extreme-value property are equivalent in ZF ([[thm-euclidean-heine-borel-pseudocompactness-and-extreme-values]]).

[L2] Under $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ and $\mathrm{DC}$, a metric space is compact if and only if it is countably compact, limit point compact, sequentially compact, or complete and totally bounded ([[thm-metric-compactness-equivalences]]).

[L3] The topological and metric readings of compactness for a Euclidean subspace agree ([[thm-compactness-agrees-with-metric-compactness]]); the named topological variants have the meanings of [[def-compactness-variants]].

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The ZF part of the chart is exactly [L1]. [L1]

1.2 In the Euclidean metric, compactness is equivalent to each of countable compactness, limit point compactness, sequential compactness, and completeness together with total boundedness by [L2]. [L2]

2.1 By [L3], this metric compactness is the compactness already occurring in step 1.1. Joining the two equivalence classes proves the asserted chart. [L3, step 1.1, step 1.2] ∎

## The dependencies it declares, quoted verbatim from disk

Each block below is the claim-bearing text of one declared dependency.
These are the only statements the item is entitled to use. If a step
needs more than the text below gives, that is the defect — quote the
dependency text and show exactly what it fails to supply.

### `thm-euclidean-heine-borel-pseudocompactness-and-extreme-values` — theorem — For a nonempty subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with $n\\ge1$, compactness, closedness and boundedness, pseudocompactness, and attainment of extrema by every continuous real-valued function are equivalent

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $n\ge1$ and let $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ be nonempty. The following are equivalent.

1. $A$ is compact.
2. $A$ is closed and bounded.
3. $A$ is pseudocompact.
4. Every continuous $f:A\to\mathbb{R}$ attains a maximum and a minimum on $A$.

This theorem is a ZF statement. The nonemptiness hypothesis is necessary for condition 4, because the empty image has neither a maximum nor a minimum.

### `thm-metric-compactness-equivalences` — theorem — For a metric space, compact, countably compact, limit point compact, sequentially compact, and complete together with totally bounded are all equivalent, given countable choice and dependent choice

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

**Assume the Axiom of Countable Choice ([[def-countable-choice]]) and the Axiom
of Dependent Choice ([[def-dependent-choice]]).** Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space
([[def-metric-space]]). Then the following five conditions are equivalent.

- **(a)** $(X,d)$ is compact ([[def-metric-compactness]]).
- **(b)** $(X,d)$ is countably compact ([[def-metric-compactness-variants]]).
- **(c)** $(X,d)$ is limit point compact.
- **(d)** $(X,d)$ is sequentially compact.
- **(e)** $(X,d)$ is complete ([[def-complete-metric-space]]) and totally bounded
  ([[def-totally-bounded]]).

**The two hypotheses are not needed everywhere, and the statement should not be
read as if they were.** Of the implications assembled below, all but two are
theorems of ZF. Dependent choice is used only for "sequentially compact implies
totally bounded" ([[thm-sequentially-compact-implies-totally-bounded]]), and
countable choice only for "complete and totally bounded implies compact"
([[thm-complete-and-totally-bounded-implies-compact]]). Each is an upper bound on
the cost of the proof given in this library and not a claim of necessity; the
implication-by-implication account is
[[rem-compactness-choice-ledger-metric]].

### `def-compactness-variants` — definition — Countably compact, Lindel\\\"of, sequentially compact, limit point compact and $\\sigma$-compact spaces, and relatively compact subsets

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]), with
open covers, subcovers, finiteness and compactness as in [[def-compact-space]],
and *finite*, *at most countable* and *uncountable* as in [[def-countable]].

- $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is **countably compact** when every open cover of $X$ that
  is at most countable has a finite subcover.
- $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is **Lindel&ouml;f** when every open cover of $X$ has an at
  most countable subcover.
- $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is **sequentially compact** when every sequence $(x_k)$ in
  $X$, that is every function $x : \mathbb{N} \to X$
  ([[def-sequence-convergence-top]]), has a subsequence $(x_{n_j})$ converging to
  a point of $X$, the index map $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ being strictly
  increasing ([[def-sequence]], [[lem-index-map-grows]]).
- $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is **limit point compact** when every infinite subset
  $A \subseteq X$ has a limit point in $X$, that is a point $p \in X$ every
  neighbourhood $N$ of which satisfies $N \cap (A \setminus \{p\}) \ne \varnothing$
  ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]). Here *infinite* means not finite in
  the sense of [[def-countable]].
- $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is **$\sigma$-compact** when there is an at most countable
  family $\mathcal{K}$ of compact subsets of $X$ with $X = \bigcup \mathcal{K}$.
- A subset $A \subseteq X$ is **relatively compact in $X$** when its closure
  $\overline{A}$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]) is a compact subset of
  $X$.

A subset $A \subseteq X$ is called countably compact, Lindel&ouml;f,
sequentially compact, limit point compact or $\sigma$-compact when the subspace
$(A, \mathcal{T}_A)$ is ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]), exactly as for
compactness. **Relative compactness is the exception and is deliberately not of
that form**: it is a statement about $A$ *inside* $X$, since $\overline{A}$ is
computed in $X$, and a set may be relatively compact in one space and not in
another that contains it. Every other notion on this list is intrinsic to the
subspace.

**The countable covers may be listed.** A nonempty at most countable family
$\mathcal{U}$ admits a surjection $\mathbb{N} \to \mathcal{U}$
([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]]), so countable compactness says: for
every sequence $(U_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of open sets with
$X = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} U_n$ there are finitely many indices whose sets
already cover $X$. That surjection is produced from the countability assumption
alone and no choice principle is involved; the empty family covers only the empty
space, which is compact anyway.

**Indexing starts at $0$.** A sequence here is a function on $\mathbb{N}$ and
$\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$ ([[def-sequence]]), so a subsequence is
$(x_{n_j})_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ with $n_0 < n_1 < \cdots$ and $n_j \ge j$
([[lem-index-map-grows]]). An index range taken from a text that starts at $1$
must be shifted before it is used here.

**Agreement with the metric definitions.** Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space carrying
its metric topology $\mathcal{T}_d$ ([[def-metric-topology]],
[[def-metrizable-space]]). Then the three notions that
[[def-metric-compactness-variants]] defines metrically are the three defined
above, read in $(X, \mathcal{T}_d)$:

- *Countably compact.* The open sets used there are the members of
  $\mathcal{T}_d$, so the at most countable open covers are the same families and
  the condition is the same condition, exactly as for compactness itself
  ([[thm-compactness-agrees-with-metric-compactness]]).
- *Sequentially compact.* Convergence of a sequence in the metric sense and in
  the sense of [[def-sequence-convergence-top]] agree on a metric topology,
  because the balls around a point are a neighbourhood base at it
  ([[def-metrizable-space]]); the subsequences quantified over are the same.
- *Limit point compact.* A point $p$ is a limit point of $A$ in the metric sense
  when every ball around $p$ meets $A \setminus \{p\}$, and in the sense above
  when every neighbourhood does; the same neighbourhood base makes the two
  conditions one ([[def-metrizable-space]],
  [[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

So no statement below about a metrizable space introduces a second notion, and
every theorem of the metric development about these three properties may be
quoted here once a metric inducing the topology is named. Lindel&ouml;fness,
$\sigma$-compactness and relative compactness have no metric counterpart in this
library and are defined here for the first time.

### `def-countable-choice` — definition — The Axiom of Countable Choice ($\\mathrm{AC}_\\omega$)

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

The **Axiom of Countable Choice**, written $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$, is the following
statement.

> For every family $(X_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of nonempty sets indexed by
> $\mathbb{N}$ there is a function $f$ with domain $\mathbb{N}$ such that
> $f(n) \in X_n$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

Equivalently, in the vocabulary of [[def-choice-function]]: every at most
countable family of nonempty sets ([[def-countable]]) has a choice function.

### `def-dependent-choice` — definition — The axiom of dependent choice: a relation in which every element is related to something admits an $\\mathbb{N}$-indexed chain

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $X$ be a set and let $R \subseteq X \times X$ be a binary relation on $X$.
Call $R$ **entire on $X$** when

$$\text{for every } x \in X \text{ there is } y \in X \text{ with } x \mathbin{R} y .$$

The **Axiom of Dependent Choice**, written $\mathrm{DC}$, is the following
statement.

> For every nonempty set $X$, every relation $R$ entire on $X$, and every
> $a \in X$, there is a sequence $x : \mathbb{N} \to X$ ([[def-sequence]],
> [[def-natural-numbers]]) with
> $$x_0 = a \qquad \text{and} \qquad x_n \mathbin{R} x_{n+1} \ \text{ for every } n \in \mathbb{N}.$$

As everywhere in this library $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$, and the sequence is
indexed from $0$; the term $x_0$ is the prescribed starting point $a$ and every
later term is related to its predecessor.

**What DC adds to what came before.** [[def-choice-function]] and
[[def-axiom-of-choice]] select one element from each member of a family that is
fixed in advance, and [[def-countable-choice]] does the same for a family indexed
by $\mathbb{N}$. In both, the family is given before any selection is made. DC is
the principle needed when the $n$-th set to select from is not known until the
first $n$ selections have been made: here the admissible values of $x_{n+1}$ are
exactly the $R$-successors of $x_n$, so the family being chosen from is built
along the choosing. That is precisely the situation $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ does not
cover, and it is why a construction "pick $x_{n+1}$ depending on $x_n$, for every
$n$ at once" is not licensed by countable choice.

**The starting point may be dropped.** The formally weaker statement obtained by
deleting the clause $x_0 = a$ — for every nonempty $X$ and every entire $R$ there
is a sequence with $x_n \mathbin{R} x_{n+1}$ for all $n$ — is an immediate
consequence of the form above, since $X$ is nonempty and any of its elements may
be taken as $a$. The reverse derivation is standard and is not needed anywhere in
this library, so it is not carried out; every use below prescribes $x_0$.

**$R$ need not be an order and the terms need not be distinct.** What DC delivers
is a sequence, that is a function $\mathbb{N} \to X$, not a chain in the
order-theoretic sense ([[def-chain]]). The relation may be symmetric, and the
sequence may repeat a value or be constant; all that is asserted is
$x_n \mathbin{R} x_{n+1}$ at every index.

### `thm-compactness-agrees-with-metric-compactness` — theorem — For a metric space with its metric topology, compactness in the topological sense is compactness in the metric sense, and the two notions of compact subset coincide

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]) and let $\mathcal{T}_d$ be
its metric topology ([[def-metric-topology]]), so that $(X, \mathcal{T}_d)$ is a
topological space ([[def-topological-space]]) and is metrizable
([[def-metrizable-space]]). Then:

1. $(X,d)$ is a compact metric space ([[def-metric-compactness]]) **if and only
   if** $(X, \mathcal{T}_d)$ is a compact topological space
   ([[def-compact-space]]).
2. For every $A \subseteq X$: $A$ is a compact subset of the metric space
   $(X,d)$ if and only if $A$ is a compact subset of the topological space
   $(X, \mathcal{T}_d)$, the two readings of "compact subset" being the metric
   subspace $(A, d_A)$ ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]) and the topological
   subspace $(A, (\mathcal{T}_d)_A)$ ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]).

**Nothing here is a coincidence and nothing is transported.** The open-cover
condition of [[def-metric-compactness]] quantifies over families of subsets open
in $(X,d)$, and by [[def-metric-topology]] those are exactly the members of
$\mathcal{T}_d$; so the two conditions are not merely equivalent, they are the
same condition written twice. No choice principle is used.
