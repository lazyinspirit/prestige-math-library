# Wave 5 audit — A6 adversarial proof reading

You are a **read-only adversarial reader** (DeepSeek V4 Pro, max reasoning)
dispatched by the wave-5 audit Alpha of the prestige-math-library published-page
retro-audit (`AUDIT-WORKFLOW.md` step A6). You return **evidence, never edits**,
and you never propose to apply anything yourself. Alpha alone adjudicates.

> **NO SHELL-PERMISSION PROMPTS (owner, 2026-07-30) — binding on every current
> and future agent.** Never ask the owner to approve a command. You have no
> shell at all, so this is automatic for you; it is stated here because the rule
> binds every agent in this workflow verbatim.

**You have no tools and no filesystem.** Everything you are to read is in this
prompt: the item under review in full, and the Statement or Definition text of
every dependency it declares, quoted verbatim from disk. Do not speculate about
text you were not given — if a decision genuinely turns on something absent,
say so explicitly and name what is missing rather than assuming its content.

**Why you specifically.** The audit-side lineup is otherwise entirely Claude:
the Beta that read and retagged these items, the Alpha adjudicating them, and
the certifier reading repairs are all Claude models, and much of this legacy
corpus was Claude-authored too. **You are the only cross-family reader in the
loop.** A shared blind spot among the Claude readers will not show up as
disagreement among them; it can only show up as you finding something they did
not. Do not defer to the fact that a published item has already passed several
readings — this audit has repeatedly confirmed fatal defects in text that had.

**This is a retro-audit of ALREADY-PUBLISHED pages.** The item in front of you
was written, gated, judged and published months ago. Nothing about that history
is evidence that it is correct; it is the reason nobody has re-read it
adversarially since. Wave 3 measured 6 of its 11 confirmed fatal defects in
items the audit had left byte-identical.

## Your standard — the judges' standard

Read every proof step and every cited dependency as someone trying to REFUTE the
item. The point of this audit is to find what is actually wrong, not to confirm
the text reads well.

Mathematical accuracy, logical validity and correct citation of dependencies are NON-NEGOTIABLE: flag any false claim, any step not licensed by its cited facts, and any citation of an item for a claim it does not make. EXPLICITLY ACCEPTABLE, do not flag: minor citational quirks; logical gaps between proof steps that a competent reader closes within 30 SECONDS; other non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter. Library conventions that are NOT defects: sequences are functions on N and N CONTAINS 0, so indices start at 0; a natural number is a von Neumann natural (a set), so 1/k is written 1/iota(k) with iota the canonical natural of the field; the successor of a von Neumann natural n is sigma(n) = n union {n}, so n = {0,1,...,n-1} and sigma(n) = {0,1,...,n} has exactly n+1 elements; sigma(n) is NOT {0,...,n-1}, and an off-by-one objection that rests on reading it that way is a misreading of the library, not a defect; items cite by [L#] into a Facts and Assumptions block; a definition may discharge its own well-definedness inline or via justified_by. Also check the TITLE against what is actually proved: a title asserting more than the proof gives is a defect even when the Statement is correct. CITATION VOICE AND FIDELITY: every [F#], [A#], and [L#] fact must state the cited Definition or Statement itself, exactly when practical or in a concise version preserving its domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, conclusion, and direction.

## Triage — the standing rule, binding

- **Non-negotiable, always report:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity,
  correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort and do NOT report:** minor citational
  quirks; logical gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other
  non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter; prose style; page
  summary length; missing provenance URLs.

**Before alleging a cited dependency is too weak, quote the dependency text you
were given and show exactly what it fails to supply.** A refuter that asserts a
dependency is insufficient without quoting it is producing noise, and this
library's dominant real defect class — a citation of an item for a claim it does
not make — can only be established by that quotation.

**Read the Remarks with a numbered step's suspicion.** Measured across this
audit, Remark and Facts-block prose, not numbered steps, is where nearly every
confirmed fatal defect in this corpus has been found. A Remark that asserts how
some *other* item in the library uses this one is a frequent falsehood: you
cannot check those from here, so say so rather than passing them.

**Choice discipline matters in this wave.** Wave 5 is real analysis and general
topology: countability axioms, separation axioms, nets, filters, ultrafilters
and function spaces. Countable choice, dependent choice, the ultrafilter lemma
and full AC are genuinely different hypotheses here, and this library records
which one an argument spends. A proof that silently uses a choice principle its
Statement does not scope, or a Statement scoping a principle strictly stronger
or weaker than the proof actually needs, is a FATAL defect of the
missing-hypothesis class — not a quibble. Equally, the library has already
adopted AC, countable choice and dependent choice as foundational axioms, so
using one *within its declared scope* is not a defect.

## Output — the only thing you return

Plain markdown. For each finding, one block:

```
### FINDING 1, 2, 3, ... — FATAL or NONFATAL — location: title / Statement / [L#] / step X.Y / Remark
CLAIM AS WRITTEN: "<verbatim quote of the offending text>"
WHY IT FAILS: <the concrete false claim, unlicensed inference, missing
hypothesis, or inaccurate citation — with the verbatim dependency text that
does or does not license it>
WHAT WOULD FIX IT: <the smallest correction you can name, or "not obvious">
```

If, having genuinely tried to refute it, you find nothing fatal, say so plainly
and list what you checked. Finish with one line: `N fatal, M nonfatal`.

A confident empty reading is worse than useless here. Either name a concrete
defect with its quotation, or state clearly that you could not find one.

## Statement

**False claim:** if a sequence $(y_n)$ of reals has a convergent subsequence,
then $(y_n)$ is bounded ([[def-sequence]], [[def-subsequential-limit]]).

This is the converse of [[thm-bolzano-weierstrass]], which says that
boundedness implies the existence of a convergent subsequence. The implication
does not reverse, and it fails as badly as it can: a sequence can be unbounded
and still have a *constant* subsequence.

The witness is the interleaving $1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, \dots$, in which the terms
at even indices run through $1, 2, 3, \dots$ and every odd-indexed term is $1$.
It is recorded separately as the named counterexample of the companion page. The
even and odd index maps are supplied by [[lem-alternating-sequence]], which also
supplies what makes the definition legitimate: every natural number is an even
index or an odd index, and never both.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The strictly increasing index maps $e, o : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ of [[lem-alternating-sequence]], whose ranges partition $\mathbb{N}$, and the sequence $(y_n)$ of reals defined by cases on that partition: $y_n := (j+1) \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ when $n = e_j$, and $y_n := 1$ when $n = o_j$ ([[def-sequence]]).

[L1] The index maps: $e$ and $o$ are strictly increasing, and every natural number is $e_j$ for exactly one $j$, or $o_j$ for exactly one $j$, and never both ([[lem-alternating-sequence]]).

[L2] Canonical naturals: $m \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} > 0$ for $m \ge 1$, and $m \mapsto m \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ is strictly increasing ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L3] Archimedean property: for every real $x$ there is a natural $m \ge 1$ with $x < m \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]]).

[L4] Absolute value: $|t| \ge t$ always, and $|t| = t$ when $t \ge 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L5] A constant sequence converges to its value, and a sequence is bounded when some real $M$ satisfies $|y_n| \le M$ at every index ([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L6] Subsequences and subsequential limits: for strictly increasing $n$, $(y_{n_j})$ is a subsequence, and its limit is a subsequential limit of $(y_n)$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-subsequential-limit]]).

[L7] Trichotomy of the order on $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L8] The refuted claim: a sequence of reals with a convergent subsequence is bounded.

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The sequence $(y_n)$ is well defined: by [L1] each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ falls under exactly one of the two clauses, and the index $j$ realising it is unique, so exactly one value is assigned to each $n$. [given, L1]

2.1 The subsequence along $o$ is the constant sequence with value $1$: for every $j$, $y_{o_j} = 1$ by the second clause. Since $o$ is strictly increasing, this is a subsequence of $(y_n)$. [step 1.1, L1, L6]

2.2 The subsequence along $e$ takes the value $y_{e_j} = (j+1)\cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ for every $j$. [step 1.1, L1]

3.1 The constant subsequence $(y_{o_j})$ converges, to $1$, so $(y_n)$ has a convergent subsequence and $1$ is a subsequential limit of it: $(y_n)$ satisfies the hypothesis of the claim. [step 2.1, L5, L6, L8]

3.2 $(y_n)$ is not bounded. Let $M \in \mathbb{R}$ be arbitrary. By [L3] fix a natural $m \ge 1$ with $|M| < m \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$, and take $j := m - 1 \in \mathbb{N}$, which is legitimate since $m \ge 1$. Then $y_{e_j} = m \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} > |M| \ge M$, and $y_{e_j} > 0$ gives $|y_{e_j}| = y_{e_j} > M$. So no real $M$ satisfies $|y_n| \le M$ at every index. [step 2.2, L2, L3, L4, L5, L7]

4.1 The sequence $(y_n)$ therefore has a convergent subsequence and is unbounded: the claim is false. [step 3.1, step 3.2, L8] ∎

## Remarks

- **What survives is exactly Bolzano-Weierstrass in the stated direction.**
  Boundedness gives a convergent subsequence ([[thm-bolzano-weierstrass]]); a
  convergent subsequence gives nothing about the sequence. The correct
  strengthening on the other side is not boundedness at all but a Cauchy
  hypothesis: a Cauchy sequence with a convergent subsequence does converge, and
  is bounded, by [[lem-cauchy-with-convergent-subsequence]] and
  [[lem-cauchy-sequence-bounded]].

- **One subsequence is never evidence about a sequence.** The same point in a
  different form is [[fs-subsequence-convergence-implies-convergence]] on the
  previous page: a convergent subsequence does not force convergence. Here it
  does not even force boundedness, which is weaker, so this is the sharper
  failure of the two.

- **The witness is as extreme as possible in one direction and as tame as
  possible in the other.** Its subsequential limit set is exactly $\{1\}$, a
  single point, while the sequence itself is unbounded; so having a one-point
  subsequential limit set does not imply convergence either, and
  [[def-subsequential-limit]] records that consequence.

- The witness is recorded as the named counterexample
  [[cex-unbounded-with-convergent-subsequence]], which also computes its
  subsequential limit set.

## The dependencies it declares, quoted verbatim from disk

Each block below is the claim-bearing text of one declared dependency.
These are the only statements the item is entitled to use. If a step
needs more than the text below gives, that is the defect — quote the
dependency text and show exactly what it fails to supply.

### `thm-bolzano-weierstrass` — theorem — Bolzano-Weierstrass: every bounded real sequence has a convergent subsequence

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Statement

Every bounded sequence of reals has a convergent subsequence: if $(x_k)$ is a
sequence of reals and there is $M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for every
$k \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-sequence]]), then there is a strictly increasing
$n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ and a real $L$ with $x_{n_j} \to L$.

Equivalently: the subsequential limit set of a bounded sequence is nonempty
([[def-subsequential-limit]]).

The theorem is the exact repair of the false claim that a bounded sequence
converges. A bounded
sequence need not converge, and the alternating sequence is the standing witness;
what boundedness does force is that *some* subsequence converges. The converse of
the theorem is false, and badly so: a sequence with a convergent subsequence need
not be bounded.

### `lem-alternating-sequence` — lemma — The even and odd index maps and the alternating sequence: strictly increasing $e, o$ with $\\mathbb{N}$ their disjoint union, and the unique $(s_k)$ with $s_0 = 1$, $s_{\\sigma(k)} = -s_k$, which satisfies $|s_k| = 1$, $s \\circ e \\equiv 1$ and $s \\circ o \\equiv -1$

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $\sigma$ be the successor on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]). There are
functions $e, o : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ and a sequence $(s_k)$ of reals
([[def-sequence]]) with the following properties.

1. **The index maps.** $e$ is the unique function with
   $e_0 = 0$ and $e_{\sigma(j)} = \sigma(\sigma(e_j))$, and $o$ the unique
   function with $o_0 = \sigma(0)$ and $o_{\sigma(j)} = \sigma(\sigma(o_j))$.
   Both are **strictly increasing**.
2. **The partition.** $\mathbb{N}$ is the **disjoint union** of the ranges of $e$
   and of $o$: every natural number is $e_i$ for exactly one $i$ or $o_i$ for
   exactly one $i$, and never both.
3. **The alternating sequence.** $(s_k)$ is the **unique** sequence of reals with
   $$s_0 = 1, \qquad s_{\sigma(k)} = -s_k \quad (k \in \mathbb{N}).$$
4. **Its values.** $|s_k| = 1$ for every $k$, so $(s_k)$ is bounded; and
   $$s_{e_j} = 1, \qquad s_{o_j} = -1 \qquad (j \in \mathbb{N}),$$
   that is $s \circ e$ is constantly $1$ and $s \circ o$ constantly $-1$.

This is the sequence usually written $s_k = (-1)^k$, with $e_j = 2j$ and
$o_j = 2j+1$, presented by the recursions that its proofs actually use. It is
collected here once because three separate items on this page and its companion
need an alternating or interleaved witness, and rebuilding the recursion inside
each of them is what this lemma exists to prevent.

### `def-subsequential-limit` — definition — Subsequential limit of a real sequence, and the subsequential limit set

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]) and let $L \in \mathbb{R}$.
Then $L$ is a **subsequential limit** of $(x_k)$ when some subsequence of $(x_k)$
converges to $L$: that is, when there is a strictly increasing
$n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that

$$x_{n_j} \longrightarrow L \qquad (j \to \infty)$$

in the sense of [[def-real-limit]]. The **subsequential limit set** of $(x_k)$ is

$$\operatorname{SL}(x) \;:=\; \{\, L \in \mathbb{R} : L \text{ is a subsequential limit of } (x_k) \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}.$$

Both pieces of the definition are already fixed elsewhere and are only combined
here: *strictly increasing* and *subsequence* are [[def-sequence]], and
*converges* is [[def-real-limit]]. Nothing about $(x_k)$ itself is assumed; in
particular $(x_k)$ is not assumed to converge, and $\operatorname{SL}(x)$ may be
empty, a single point, or larger.

**A subsequence looks arbitrarily far out.** A strictly increasing index map
satisfies $n_j \ge j$ for every $j$ ([[lem-index-map-grows]]), so the indices
$n_j$ are cofinal in $\mathbb{N}$ and a subsequential limit is determined by the
behaviour of $(x_k)$ at arbitrarily large indices. Consequently no finite
initial segment of $(x_k)$ affects $\operatorname{SL}(x)$: a sequence and each of
its tails have the same subsequential limits.

**Terminology.** Some texts say *cluster point*, *limit point* or *accumulation
value* of the sequence for the same notion. This library says *subsequential
limit* throughout, reserving *limit point* for the topological notion of a limit
point of a set, which is a different thing: the set $\{x_k\}$ of values of the
constant sequence $x_k = 0$ has no limit point, while $0$ is a subsequential
limit of that sequence.

### `def-sequence` — definition — Sequences of reals: bounded, eventually, frequently, tails, subsequences

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]],
[[def-real-numbers]]) with its order and absolute value ([[def-real-order]]), and
$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers with its order ([[def-natural-numbers]],
[[def-nat-order]]).

A **sequence of reals** is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$. We write
$x_k$ for the value $x(k)$, call it the **$k$-th term**, and write $(x_k)$, or
$(x_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$, for the function itself. The **range** of $(x_k)$ is
the subset $\{\, x_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals and let $P$ be a property of indices.

- $(x_k)$ is **bounded** if there is $M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for
  every $k \in \mathbb{N}$; it is **unbounded** otherwise.
- $P$ holds **eventually** if there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $P(k)$ holds
  for every $k \ge K$.
- $P$ holds **frequently** if for every $K \in \mathbb{N}$ there is some
  $k \ge K$ for which $P(k)$ holds.
- For $K \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$K$-th tail** of $(x_k)$ is the sequence
  $x^{(K)}$ defined by $x^{(K)}_j := x_{j + K}$ for $j \in \mathbb{N}$; it is
  again a sequence of reals.
- A function $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is **strictly increasing** if
  $n_j < n_k$ whenever $j < k$. For such an $n$, the **subsequence** of $(x_k)$
  along $n$ is the composite $x \circ n$, written $(x_{n_k})_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$;
  it is again a sequence of reals.

**Convergence and Cauchyness are not defined here.** They are already fixed, for
sequences of reals, by the published [[def-real-limit]]: $(x_k)$ *converges* to
$x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is
$K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$, and $(x_k)$
is *Cauchy* when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$
with $|x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$. This page builds the
toolkit for those two notions and does not restate them. A sequence
**converges** if it converges to some real, and **diverges** if it does not.

### `def-real-limit` — definition — Limits and Cauchy sequences of reals

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals **converges** to $x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for
every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with
$|x_k - x| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$. It is **Cauchy** when for
every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with
$|x_k - x_l| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$.

### `thm-of-archimedean` — theorem — Every complete ordered field is Archimedean

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Statement

Every complete ordered field $F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) is Archimedean:
for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$,
where $n \cdot 1_F$ is the canonical natural of the ordered field $F$
([[def-ordered-field]]). Equivalently, the canonical naturals are cofinal in $F$.

### `lem-of-naturals-positive` — lemma — Canonical naturals are positive and strictly increasing

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field, with field structure as in [[def-field]], and for
$n \ge 1$ let $n \cdot 1_F$ denote the canonical natural number
$\underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$, defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$
and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$. Then for every $n \ge 1$:

- $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$;
- the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$;
- $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ and $(mn) \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F)$ for all $m, n \ge 1$.

### `lem-of-abs-value` — lemma — Basic properties of the absolute value

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$, with
$|x|$ the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]). Then

$$|x| \ge 0; \quad |x| = 0 \iff x = 0; \quad -|x| \le x \le |x|; \quad |-x| = |x|; \quad |xy| = |x|\,|y|;$$

and, for every $c > 0$, one has $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$.

### `def-complete-ordered-field` — definition — Complete ordered field (least-upper-bound property)

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq F$.

- $u \in F$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$; $S$ is
  **bounded above** if it has an upper bound.
- $u \in F$ is a **least upper bound** (or **supremum**, $\sup S$) of $S$ if $u$
  is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le u'$ for every upper bound $u'$ of $S$.

$F$ is a **complete ordered field** (equivalently, $F$ has the
**least-upper-bound property**, or is **Dedekind complete**) if every nonempty
$S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$.

### `def-ordered-field` — definition — Ordered field

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ ([[def-field]]) together with a subset
$P \subseteq F$, the set of **positive** elements (the *positive cone*),
satisfying:

- **(O1) Trichotomy.** For each $x \in F$, exactly one of the following holds:
  $x \in P$, or $x = 0$, or $-x \in P$.
- **(O2) Closure.** If $x, y \in P$ then $x + y \in P$ and $x \cdot y \in P$.

We write $x > 0$ for $x \in P$ (read "$x$ is positive"), and define the order by

$$a < b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; b - a \in P, \qquad a \le b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; a < b \text{ or } a = b.$$

Thus $a > b$ means $b < a$, and $a \ge b$ means $b \le a$. An element $x$ with
$-x \in P$ (equivalently $x < 0$) is called **negative**.
