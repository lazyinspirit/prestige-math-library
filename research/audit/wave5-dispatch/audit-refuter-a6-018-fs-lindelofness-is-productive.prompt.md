# Wave 5 audit — A6 adversarial proof reading

You are a **read-only adversarial reader** (DeepSeek V4 Pro, max reasoning)
dispatched by the wave-5 audit Alpha of the prestige-math-library published-page
retro-audit (`AUDIT-WORKFLOW.md` step A6). You return **evidence, never edits**,
and you never propose to apply anything yourself. Alpha alone adjudicates.

> **NO SHELL-PERMISSION PROMPTS (owner, 2026-07-30) — binding on every current
> and future agent.** Never ask the owner to approve a command. You have no
> shell at all, so this is automatic for you; it is stated here because the rule
> binds every agent in this workflow verbatim.

**You have no tools and no filesystem.** Everything you are to read is in this
prompt: the item under review in full, and the Statement or Definition text of
every dependency it declares, quoted verbatim from disk. Do not speculate about
text you were not given — if a decision genuinely turns on something absent,
say so explicitly and name what is missing rather than assuming its content.

**Why you specifically.** The audit-side lineup is otherwise entirely Claude:
the Beta that read and retagged these items, the Alpha adjudicating them, and
the certifier reading repairs are all Claude models, and much of this legacy
corpus was Claude-authored too. **You are the only cross-family reader in the
loop.** A shared blind spot among the Claude readers will not show up as
disagreement among them; it can only show up as you finding something they did
not. Do not defer to the fact that a published item has already passed several
readings — this audit has repeatedly confirmed fatal defects in text that had.

**This is a retro-audit of ALREADY-PUBLISHED pages.** The item in front of you
was written, gated, judged and published months ago. Nothing about that history
is evidence that it is correct; it is the reason nobody has re-read it
adversarially since. Wave 3 measured 6 of its 11 confirmed fatal defects in
items the audit had left byte-identical.

## Your standard — the judges' standard

Read every proof step and every cited dependency as someone trying to REFUTE the
item. The point of this audit is to find what is actually wrong, not to confirm
the text reads well.

Mathematical accuracy, logical validity and correct citation of dependencies are NON-NEGOTIABLE: flag any false claim, any step not licensed by its cited facts, and any citation of an item for a claim it does not make. EXPLICITLY ACCEPTABLE, do not flag: minor citational quirks; logical gaps between proof steps that a competent reader closes within 30 SECONDS; other non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter. Library conventions that are NOT defects: sequences are functions on N and N CONTAINS 0, so indices start at 0; a natural number is a von Neumann natural (a set), so 1/k is written 1/iota(k) with iota the canonical natural of the field; the successor of a von Neumann natural n is sigma(n) = n union {n}, so n = {0,1,...,n-1} and sigma(n) = {0,1,...,n} has exactly n+1 elements; sigma(n) is NOT {0,...,n-1}, and an off-by-one objection that rests on reading it that way is a misreading of the library, not a defect; items cite by [L#] into a Facts and Assumptions block; a definition may discharge its own well-definedness inline or via justified_by. Also check the TITLE against what is actually proved: a title asserting more than the proof gives is a defect even when the Statement is correct. CITATION VOICE AND FIDELITY: every [F#], [A#], and [L#] fact must state the cited Definition or Statement itself, exactly when practical or in a concise version preserving its domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, conclusion, and direction.

## Triage — the standing rule, binding

- **Non-negotiable, always report:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity,
  correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort and do NOT report:** minor citational
  quirks; logical gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other
  non-fatal quirks; imperfection at the level of the letter; prose style; page
  summary length; missing provenance URLs.

**Before alleging a cited dependency is too weak, quote the dependency text you
were given and show exactly what it fails to supply.** A refuter that asserts a
dependency is insufficient without quoting it is producing noise, and this
library's dominant real defect class — a citation of an item for a claim it does
not make — can only be established by that quotation.

**Read the Remarks with a numbered step's suspicion.** Measured across this
audit, Remark and Facts-block prose, not numbered steps, is where nearly every
confirmed fatal defect in this corpus has been found. A Remark that asserts how
some *other* item in the library uses this one is a frequent falsehood: you
cannot check those from here, so say so rather than passing them.

**Choice discipline matters in this wave.** Wave 5 is real analysis and general
topology: countability axioms, separation axioms, nets, filters, ultrafilters
and function spaces. Countable choice, dependent choice, the ultrafilter lemma
and full AC are genuinely different hypotheses here, and this library records
which one an argument spends. A proof that silently uses a choice principle its
Statement does not scope, or a Statement scoping a principle strictly stronger
or weaker than the proof actually needs, is a FATAL defect of the
missing-hypothesis class — not a quibble. Equally, the library has already
adopted AC, countable choice and dependent choice as foundational axioms, so
using one *within its declared scope* is not a defect.

## Output — the only thing you return

Plain markdown. For each finding, one block:

```
### FINDING 1, 2, 3, ... — FATAL or NONFATAL — location: title / Statement / [L#] / step X.Y / Remark
CLAIM AS WRITTEN: "<verbatim quote of the offending text>"
WHY IT FAILS: <the concrete false claim, unlicensed inference, missing
hypothesis, or inaccurate citation — with the verbatim dependency text that
does or does not license it>
WHAT WOULD FIX IT: <the smallest correction you can name, or "not obvious">
```

If, having genuinely tried to refute it, you find nothing fatal, say so plainly
and list what you checked. Finish with one line: `N fatal, M nonfatal`.

A confident empty reading is worse than useless here. Either name a concrete
defect with its quotation, or state clearly that you could not find one.

## Statement
Assuming countable choice, products of Lindelöf spaces are Lindelöf.
## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The lower-limit line $S$, with basis $[a,b)$ for $a<b$, and its product $S^2$.

[L1] A basis characterises its open sets locally, and the products of basic open sets form a basis for the product topology ([[thm-basis-criterion]], [[def-product-topology]]).

[L2] The rationals are at most countable and dense in the real line, the real line is uncountable, and a set injecting into an at most countable set is at most countable ([[thm-rationals-countable]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]], [[thm-r-uncountable]], [[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]]).

[A1] Countable choice selects from every nonempty family indexed by an at most countable set ([[def-countable-choice]]).

[L3] Lindelöfness means that every open cover has an at most countable subcover ([[def-compactness-variants]]).
## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For an open cover $\mathcal U$ of $S$, let $\mathcal D$ be all basic intervals $[a,b)$ lying in members of $\mathcal U$, and put $C=\bigcup\{(a,b):[a,b)\in\mathcal D\}$. For every rational pair $p<q$ for which $(p,q)\subseteq(a,b)$ for some $[a,b)\in\mathcal D$, use [A1] to select one such member of $\mathcal D$. The selected family is at most countable and covers $C$: every point of an interval $(a,b)$ lies in some rational interval $(p,q)\subseteq(a,b)$. [L1, L2, A1]

1.2 The antidiagonal $A=\{(x,-x):x\in\mathbb R\}$ is uncountable and discrete in $S^2$, because $[x,x+1)\times[-x,-x+1)$ meets $A$ only in $(x,-x)$. [L1, L2]

1.3 The antidiagonal is closed: a point $(u,v)$ with $u+v\ne0$ has a basic rectangle avoiding $A$, using $[u,u+1)\times[v,v+1)$ when $u+v>0$ and sufficiently short intervals ending before the sum reaches $0$ when $u+v<0$. [L1]

2.1 Fix an enumeration of $\mathbb Q$. If $x\notin C$, some member of $\mathcal D$ containing $x$ must have left endpoint exactly $x$; otherwise $x$ would lie in its ordinary interior and hence in $C$. Let $r_x$ be the first rational in the fixed enumeration satisfying $x<r_x$ and $[x,r_x)\in\mathcal D$; such a rational exists by [L2]. If $x<y$ and $r_x=r_y$, then $y\in(x,r_x)\subseteq C$, a contradiction. Thus $x\mapsto r_x$ injects $\mathbb R\setminus C$ into $\mathbb Q$, so $\mathbb R\setminus C$ is at most countable. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.2 The open cover consisting of $S^2\setminus A$ and one isolating basic rectangle for each point of $A$ has no at most countable subcover, so $S^2$ is not Lindelöf. [step 1.2, step 1.3, L3]

3.1 The selected basic intervals from step 1.1 together with the $[x,r_x)$ from step 2.1 form an at most countable basic cover of $S$. Using [A1], select for each of them a containing member of $\mathcal U$. The result is an at most countable subcover, so $S$ is Lindelöf. [step 1.1, step 2.1, A1, L3]

4.1 Thus the Lindelöf space $S$ has a non-Lindelöf square, refuting productivity of Lindelöfness. [step 3.1, step 2.2] ∎

## The dependencies it declares, quoted verbatim from disk

Each block below is the claim-bearing text of one declared dependency.
These are the only statements the item is entitled to use. If a step
needs more than the text below gives, that is the defect — quote the
dependency text and show exactly what it fails to supply.

### `def-compactness-variants` — definition — Countably compact, Lindel\\\"of, sequentially compact, limit point compact and $\\sigma$-compact spaces, and relatively compact subsets

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]), with
open covers, subcovers, finiteness and compactness as in [[def-compact-space]],
and *finite*, *at most countable* and *uncountable* as in [[def-countable]].

- $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is **countably compact** when every open cover of $X$ that
  is at most countable has a finite subcover.
- $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is **Lindel&ouml;f** when every open cover of $X$ has an at
  most countable subcover.
- $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is **sequentially compact** when every sequence $(x_k)$ in
  $X$, that is every function $x : \mathbb{N} \to X$
  ([[def-sequence-convergence-top]]), has a subsequence $(x_{n_j})$ converging to
  a point of $X$, the index map $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ being strictly
  increasing ([[def-sequence]], [[lem-index-map-grows]]).
- $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is **limit point compact** when every infinite subset
  $A \subseteq X$ has a limit point in $X$, that is a point $p \in X$ every
  neighbourhood $N$ of which satisfies $N \cap (A \setminus \{p\}) \ne \varnothing$
  ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]). Here *infinite* means not finite in
  the sense of [[def-countable]].
- $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is **$\sigma$-compact** when there is an at most countable
  family $\mathcal{K}$ of compact subsets of $X$ with $X = \bigcup \mathcal{K}$.
- A subset $A \subseteq X$ is **relatively compact in $X$** when its closure
  $\overline{A}$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]) is a compact subset of
  $X$.

A subset $A \subseteq X$ is called countably compact, Lindel&ouml;f,
sequentially compact, limit point compact or $\sigma$-compact when the subspace
$(A, \mathcal{T}_A)$ is ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]), exactly as for
compactness. **Relative compactness is the exception and is deliberately not of
that form**: it is a statement about $A$ *inside* $X$, since $\overline{A}$ is
computed in $X$, and a set may be relatively compact in one space and not in
another that contains it. Every other notion on this list is intrinsic to the
subspace.

**The countable covers may be listed.** A nonempty at most countable family
$\mathcal{U}$ admits a surjection $\mathbb{N} \to \mathcal{U}$
([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]]), so countable compactness says: for
every sequence $(U_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of open sets with
$X = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} U_n$ there are finitely many indices whose sets
already cover $X$. That surjection is produced from the countability assumption
alone and no choice principle is involved; the empty family covers only the empty
space, which is compact anyway.

**Indexing starts at $0$.** A sequence here is a function on $\mathbb{N}$ and
$\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$ ([[def-sequence]]), so a subsequence is
$(x_{n_j})_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ with $n_0 < n_1 < \cdots$ and $n_j \ge j$
([[lem-index-map-grows]]). An index range taken from a text that starts at $1$
must be shifted before it is used here.

**Agreement with the metric definitions.** Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space carrying
its metric topology $\mathcal{T}_d$ ([[def-metric-topology]],
[[def-metrizable-space]]). Then the three notions that
[[def-metric-compactness-variants]] defines metrically are the three defined
above, read in $(X, \mathcal{T}_d)$:

- *Countably compact.* The open sets used there are the members of
  $\mathcal{T}_d$, so the at most countable open covers are the same families and
  the condition is the same condition, exactly as for compactness itself
  ([[thm-compactness-agrees-with-metric-compactness]]).
- *Sequentially compact.* Convergence of a sequence in the metric sense and in
  the sense of [[def-sequence-convergence-top]] agree on a metric topology,
  because the balls around a point are a neighbourhood base at it
  ([[def-metrizable-space]]); the subsequences quantified over are the same.
- *Limit point compact.* A point $p$ is a limit point of $A$ in the metric sense
  when every ball around $p$ meets $A \setminus \{p\}$, and in the sense above
  when every neighbourhood does; the same neighbourhood base makes the two
  conditions one ([[def-metrizable-space]],
  [[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

So no statement below about a metrizable space introduces a second notion, and
every theorem of the metric development about these three properties may be
quoted here once a metric inducing the topology is named. Lindel&ouml;fness,
$\sigma$-compactness and relative compactness have no metric counterpart in this
library and are defined here for the first time.

### `def-product-topology` — definition — The product set $\\prod_{i \\in I} X_i$ of functions choosing a point in each factor, the projections, the box topology, and the product topology as the initial topology of the projections; the empty product is a one-point space

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

**The product set.** Let $I$ be a set and let $X_i$ be a set for each $i \in I$.
The **product** is

$$\prod_{i \in I} X_i \;:=\; \Big\{\, x : x \text{ is a function with domain } I \text{ and } x(i) \in X_i \text{ for every } i \in I \,\Big\},$$

and we write $x_i := x(i)$, the $i$-th **coordinate** of $x$. Two elements of the
product are equal exactly when they agree at every index, functions being equal
when they have the same domain and the same values. For $j \in I$ the $j$-th
**projection** is

$$\pi_j : \prod_{i \in I} X_i \to X_j, \qquad \pi_j(x) := x_j .$$

**Notation for a finite product.** For $I = n$ a natural number, which is the set
$\{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ of its predecessors, an element of $\prod_{k<n} X_k$ is a
function on $n$ and we write it $(x_0, \dots, x_{n-1})$. In particular $I = 2$
gives the **binary product**, written $X \times Y$ for $\prod_{i<2} X_i$ with
$X_0 = X$ and $X_1 = Y$, whose elements are written $(u,v)$ for the function
$0 \mapsto u$, $1 \mapsto v$. This is the only meaning the symbol $X \times Y$
carries on this page.

**Two facts about when the product is nonempty, stated because they are used and
because they cost something.** If some $X_{i_0}$ is empty then the product is
empty, since no function can take a value in $X_{i_0}$. Conversely, suppose every
$X_i$ is nonempty.

- For $I = n$ a natural number, the product is nonempty, and this is a theorem of
  ZF: [[lem-finite-choice]] applied to the function $i \mapsto X_i$ on $n$
  supplies a choice function $g$ for the family of values, and
  $x(i) := g(X_i)$ defines a member of $\prod_{k<n} X_k$.
- For an arbitrary $I$ the assertion "$\prod_{i \in I} X_i \ne \varnothing$
  whenever every $X_i$ is nonempty" **is** the Axiom of Choice: it is the
  formulation recorded in [[def-axiom-of-choice]], and the choice function of
  [[def-choice-function]] is exactly a point of the product of a family by
  itself. Every use of it below is flagged at the step that spends it.

**The box topology.** Now let each $X_i$ carry a topology $\mathcal{T}_i$
([[def-topological-space]]). Put

$$\mathcal{R} \;:=\; \Big\{\, \prod_{i \in I} U_i \;:\; U_i \in \mathcal{T}_i \text{ for every } i \in I \,\Big\},$$

the family of **boxes**. $\mathcal{R}$ is a basis for a topology
([[thm-basis-criterion]]): it contains $\prod_i X_i$, so it covers the product,
and it is closed under binary intersections, since

$$\Big(\prod_i U_i\Big) \cap \Big(\prod_i V_i\Big) = \prod_i (U_i \cap V_i)$$

and each $U_i \cap V_i$ is open by (T3). The topology it generates is the **box
topology** $\mathcal{T}^{\square}$, and $\mathcal{R}$ is a basis for it
([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]).

**The product topology.** The **product topology** $\mathcal{T}^{\Pi}$ on
$\prod_i X_i$ is the initial topology of the family of projections
$(\pi_i)_{i \in I}$ ([[def-initial-and-final-topology]]): the topology generated
by the subbasis

$$\mathcal{G} \;:=\; \{\, \pi_i^{-1}[U] : i \in I,\ U \in \mathcal{T}_i \,\}, \qquad \pi_i^{-1}[U] = \prod_{j \in I} W_j \ \text{ with } W_i = U \text{ and } W_j = X_j \text{ for } j \ne i .$$

By [[thm-basis-criterion]] the finite intersections of members of $\mathcal{G}$
form a basis for $\mathcal{T}^{\Pi}$, and those finite intersections are exactly
the boxes with all but finitely many factors unrestricted:

$$\mathcal{R}^{\Pi} \;=\; \Big\{\, \prod_{i \in I} U_i \;:\; U_i \in \mathcal{T}_i \text{ for every } i, \text{ and } U_i = X_i \text{ for all but finitely many } i \,\Big\}.$$

Indeed the intersection of $\pi_{i_1}^{-1}[U_1], \dots, \pi_{i_n}^{-1}[U_n]$ is
the box whose factor at $i$ is the intersection of those $U_m$ with $i_m = i$ and
is $X_i$ when no $i_m$ equals $i$; and the intersection of no members is the
whole product, the box with every factor $X_i$. Conversely a box with
$U_i = X_i$ off a finite set is such an intersection. Members of
$\mathcal{R}^{\Pi}$ are called **basic product-open** sets, and members of
$\mathcal{R}$ **boxes**. So $\mathcal{R}^{\Pi} \subseteq \mathcal{R}$, with
equality when $I$ is a natural number.

**The empty product.** For $I = \varnothing$ there is exactly one function with
domain $\varnothing$, the empty function, so $\prod_{i \in \varnothing} X_i$ is a
one-point set. A one-point set carries exactly one topology, namely
$\{\varnothing, \{\varnothing\}\}$, since a topology must contain the empty set
and the whole set and there is nothing else to contain
([[def-topological-space]]); so the box topology and the product topology agree
there, and both equal the discrete topology and the indiscrete topology
([[def-standard-topologies]]), which coincide on a one-point set. There are no
projections to speak of, and the initial topology of the empty family is indeed
the indiscrete one ([[def-initial-and-final-topology]]).

**Convention.** Unless the box topology is named explicitly, $\prod_i X_i$ always
carries the product topology in this library. That is not a matter of taste: the
product topology is the one with the characteristic property of the next item,
and the box topology has no such property.

### `def-interval` — definition — Intervals of $\\mathbb{R}$: the nine order-convex forms, nondegeneracy, and length

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

### `thm-basis-criterion` — theorem — A family is a basis for a unique topology iff it covers the set and every point of an intersection of two members lies in a member inside that intersection; finite intersections of any subbasis form a basis

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $X$ be a set, and for $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ write

$$\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{B}} := \{\, U \subseteq X : \text{for every } x \in U \text{ there is } B \in \mathcal{B} \text{ with } x \in B \subseteq U \,\} .$$

1. $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for some topology on $X$ ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]])
   if and only if

   - **(B1)** $\bigcup \mathcal{B} = X$, and
   - **(B2)** for all $B_1, B_2 \in \mathcal{B}$ and every $x \in B_1 \cap B_2$
     there is $B_3 \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B_3 \subseteq B_1 \cap B_2$.

   When (B1) and (B2) hold, that topology is **unique**: it is
   $\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{B}}$, which is also exactly the family of all unions of
   subfamilies of $\mathcal{B}$.

2. Let $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ be an arbitrary family and let
   $\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S}}$ be the family of intersections of finitely many
   members of $\mathcal{S}$. Then $\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S}}$ satisfies (B1) and
   (B2), and $\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S}}} = \langle \mathcal{S} \rangle$,
   the topology generated by $\mathcal{S}$. So the finite intersections of any
   subbasis form a basis for the topology it generates.

**The nullary intersection: this library takes the empty intersection to be $X$.**
In claim 2 the phrase "finitely many" includes **none**, and the intersection of
the empty subfamily of $\mathcal{S}$ is $X$, because the defining condition "lies
in every member of the empty family" holds of every point of $X$. Hence
$X \in \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S}}$ for every $\mathcal{S}$, including
$\mathcal{S} = \varnothing$, and **no covering hypothesis is imposed on a
subbasis**. The competing convention takes only nonempty finite intersections and
compensates by requiring $\bigcup \mathcal{S} = X$; under it claim 2 holds
verbatim once that hypothesis is added, and the two conventions differ only in
which of the two devices supplies (B1). The choice made here is recorded again
among this page's conventions, and it is the reason
$\langle \varnothing \rangle$ comes out as the indiscrete topology
$\{\varnothing, X\}$ rather than being undefined.

### `thm-rationals-countable` — theorem — $\\mathbb{Q}$ is countably infinite

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

$\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-equinumerous]]): the rationals are
countably infinite ([[def-countable]]).

**No choice principle is used.** The one place where a reader expects a choice,
"pick a representative $a/b$ of each rational", is exactly where
[[lem-rat-positive-denominator]] applies: every rational *has* a representative
with positive denominator, so the map $(a,b) \mapsto [(a,b)]$ defined on
$\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ is already **surjective** onto $\mathbb{Q}$,
and countability follows from a surjection without ever selecting a
representative. The same device handles $\mathbb{Z}$, which is a surjective image
of $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ by construction ([[def-integers]]).

### `thm-r-uncountable` — theorem — $\\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable (Cantor's nested intervals, 1874)

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $\mathbb{R}$ be a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).
Then $\mathbb{R}$ is **uncountable** ([[def-countable]]): there is no surjection
$\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, so $\mathbb{R}$ is neither finite nor countably
infinite.

The proof is Cantor's original argument of 1874, not the decimal diagonal.
Assuming a surjection $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, one builds nested closed
intervals $[a_n, b_n]$ with $a_n < b_n$ and $f(n) \notin [a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}]$, and
then $\sup\{a_n\}$ is a real number that $f$ misses. **The decimal diagonal is
deliberately avoided**: decimal expansions are infinite series, which this
library has not yet constructed, so a diagonal proof here would rest on machinery
that does not exist. The diagonal argument survives in its non-circular form, on
power sets, as Cantor's theorem earlier on this page; see the remarks below.

**The construction uses no choice, and that is what the thirds are for.** Given
$[a_n, b_n]$ of length $d$, its three closed thirds
$[a_n, a_n + d/3]$, $[a_n + d/3, a_n + 2d/3]$, $[a_n + 2d/3, b_n]$ cannot all
contain $f(n)$, because the first and the third are disjoint; the rule takes the
**first one in that fixed order** which does not contain $f(n)$. That is a
definition by cases, so the whole construction is a single application of the
recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) to one explicitly given function. A version
of the argument that says "pick a third avoiding $f(n)$" would be using dependent
choice, silently and unnecessarily.

### `lem-rat-embeds-dense` — lemma — The rationals embed densely in the reals

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

The map $q \mapsto \hat q$ ([[def-real-numbers]]) is an embedding of ordered
fields. Every real is approximated by rationals: for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and
rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ with
$|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$. Consequently, strictly between any two
reals lies a rational.

### `lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n` — lemma — A nonempty set is at most countable iff it is a surjective image of $\\mathbb{N}$

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $A$ be a nonempty set. Then $A$ is at most countable ([[def-countable]]) if
and only if there is a surjection $s : \mathbb{N} \to A$
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

Moreover, from any such surjection an injection $A \to \mathbb{N}$ is obtained
explicitly, without any choice, by

$$j(a) := \min\{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : s(k) = a \,\}.$$

This is the working form of countability used everywhere below: to prove a
nonempty set countable it suffices to list its elements, repetitions and all.

**No choice principle is used.** The backward direction is where an appeal to
choice would be natural ("for each $a$ pick some $k$ with $s(k) = a$") and it is
avoided outright, because $\min$ is canonical: every nonempty set of naturals has
a *least* element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]), so $j(a)$ is determined by
$a$ and $s$ alone.

### `def-countable-choice` — definition — The Axiom of Countable Choice ($\\mathrm{AC}_\\omega$)

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

The **Axiom of Countable Choice**, written $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$, is the following
statement.

> For every family $(X_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of nonempty sets indexed by
> $\mathbb{N}$ there is a function $f$ with domain $\mathbb{N}$ such that
> $f(n) \in X_n$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

Equivalently, in the vocabulary of [[def-choice-function]]: every at most
countable family of nonempty sets ([[def-countable]]) has a choice function.
