## Statement

Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals. If the series $\sum a_k$ converges
([[def-series]]) then the sequence $(a_k)$ converges ([[def-real-limit]]), with

$$\lim_{k} a_k \;=\; 0 .$$

Equivalently, in the contrapositive form in which the lemma is almost always
used: **if $(a_k)$ does not converge to $0$ then $\sum a_k$ diverges.**

The same statement holds for a series $\sum_{k \ge m} a_k$ with a general
starting index, with the conclusion that $(a_{j+m})_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges
to $0$: that series is by definition the series of the sequence
$b_j = a_{j+m}$ ([[def-series]]), so it is the statement above applied to $(b_j)$.

The converse is false; it is refuted by [[fs-nth-term-test-converse]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(a_k)$ of reals whose series converges, with partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[A1] $(s_n)$ converges to some real $S$ ([[def-series]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L1] The recursion clause of the finite sum: $s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[def-series]]).

[L2] Convergence depends only on the tail: if $(x_n)$ converges to $x$ then so does its $1$-st tail $(x_{n+1})_{n}$ ([[lem-limit-of-tail]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L3] Algebra of limits: if $x_n \to x$ and $y_n \to y$ then $x_n - y_n \to x - y$ ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The sequence $(s_{n+1})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is the $1$-st tail of $(s_n)$, and it converges to $S$. [A1, L2]

1.2 From the recursion clause, $a_n = s_{n+1} - s_n$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. [L1, algebra]

2.1 Hence $(a_n)$ is the difference of two sequences converging to $S$, so it converges to $S - S = 0$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, A1, L3]

3.1 That is the claim, and its contrapositive is the assertion that a series whose terms do not tend to $0$ diverges. [step 2.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **This is a necessary condition and never a sufficient one.** It rules a series out; it never rules one in. The harmonic series has terms tending to $0$ and diverges, which is exactly the content of [[fs-nth-term-test-converse]].

- **What the proof actually uses.** Only that the partial sums converge and that consecutive partial sums differ by a term. No sign hypothesis is placed on $(a_k)$, and none is available at this point on the page.

## Definition

Throughout this page $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), in particular an ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]]) and a field ([[def-field]]), and $\mathbb{N}$ is the set
of natural numbers ([[def-natural-numbers]]) with successor $\sigma(n) = n + 1$
([[def-nat-addition]]).

Let $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a sequence of reals, written $a_k$ for
$a(k)$. **Finite sums and finite products of $a$ are defined by recursion on the
upper index**, which is legitimate because of the recursion theorem
([[thm-recursion]]). That theorem produces a function of one variable, so the
running index has to be carried along inside the value: applying it to the set
$A = \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$, the starting element $(0, 0)$ and the function
$f(n, s) = (\sigma(n),\, s + a_n)$ gives a unique
$g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$ with

$$g(0) = (0, 0), \qquad g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n)) \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Write $g(n) = \big(\pi_1(g(n)),\, \Sigma_n\big)$ for its two coordinates.

**The first coordinate is the index itself, and that is a small induction, not an
observation** ([[thm-induction-principle]]). Indeed $\pi_1(g(0)) = 0$; and if
$\pi_1(g(n)) = n$, then
$g(\sigma(n)) = f\big(\pi_1(g(n)), \Sigma_n\big) = \big(\sigma(\pi_1(g(n))),\, \Sigma_n + a_{\pi_1(g(n))}\big) = \big(\sigma(n),\, \Sigma_n + a_n\big)$,
so $\pi_1(g(\sigma(n))) = \sigma(n)$. By induction $\pi_1(g(n)) = n$ for every
$n \in \mathbb{N}$. Only now may the second coordinate of the two displayed
clauses be read off, and doing so gives

$$\Sigma_0 = 0, \qquad \Sigma_{\sigma(n)} = \Sigma_n + a_n .$$

$\Sigma$ is moreover the **unique** function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with those
two properties: if $\Sigma'$ also has them then $n \mapsto (n, \Sigma'_n)$ satisfies
the two clauses defining $g$, hence equals $g$ by the uniqueness clause of
[[thm-recursion]], so $\Sigma' = \Sigma$.

We write $\sum_{k < n} a_k := \Sigma_n$. The same construction with starting
element $(0, 1)$ and $f(n, p) = (\sigma(n),\, p \cdot a_n)$, with the same
induction on the first coordinate and the same uniqueness argument, gives the
unique $\Pi : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with

$$\Pi_0 = 1, \qquad \Pi_{\sigma(n)} = \Pi_n \cdot a_n ,$$

and we write $\prod_{k < n} a_k := \Pi_n$.

**Notation.** For $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ we abbreviate

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \sum_{k < n+1} a_k, \qquad \prod_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \prod_{k < n+1} a_k,$$

and, for a general lower index $m$ with $m \le n + 1$, writing $d = n + 1 - m$
for the number of terms,

$$\sum_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \sum_{j < d} a_{m+j}, \qquad \prod_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \prod_{j < d} a_{m+j} .$$

When $m = n + 1$ we have $d = 0$ and the sum is **empty**, with value $0$, while
the empty product has value $1$. In the same spirit $\sum_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ is
notation for the empty sum $\Sigma_0 = 0$ and $\prod_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ for the
empty product $\Pi_0 = 1$; the index $-1$ never occurs as an element of
$\mathbb{N}$ and is only a way of writing "no terms".

Only finitely many values of $a$ enter $\sum_{k<n} a_k$, so the notation
$\sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\prod_{k<n} a_k$ is also used for a list
$a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$ of reals given without reference to any extension of the
list to all of $\mathbb{N}$: extend the list by $a_k = 0$ (respectively
$a_k = 1$) for $k \ge n$ and apply the definition above.

## Remarks

- **Why recursion and not "$a_0 + a_1 + \cdots + a_{n-1}$".** The dots are not a
  definition: they presuppose that the displayed pattern determines a value for
  every $n$, which is exactly what the recursion theorem
  ([[thm-recursion]]) supplies, and its uniqueness clause is what makes
  $\sum_{k<n} a_k$ a single well-determined real rather than a family of choices.
  Associativity and commutativity of addition are *not* used in the definition;
  they are used in the laws proved from it ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).
- **Naturals and rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$ (a convention used on the whole
  page).** A natural number $n$ and a rational number $r$ are not literally
  elements of $\mathbb{R}$: they enter $\mathbb{R}$ through the canonical
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$, which is an injective,
  order-preserving field homomorphism ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), restricting on
  positive naturals to $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} = 1_\mathbb{R} + \cdots + 1_\mathbb{R}$
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). Following ordinary practice, and only where no
  confusion is possible, we write $n$ for $\iota(n)$ and $r$ for $\iota(r)$; so,
  for instance, $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k<n} a_k$ means
  $\iota(n)^{-1} \cdot \sum_{k<n} a_k$, which makes sense because
  $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$. Exponents are the one place where the
  identification is deliberately NOT made: in $a^n$ and $a^r$ the exponent stays
  a natural, an integer or a rational ([[def-integer-power]],
  [[def-rational-power]]), never a real.
- The two indexings are related by $\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k = \sum_{k < n+1} a_k$, so
  a statement proved for one is available for the other. Sums over $k < n$ are
  the primitive form here because $\Sigma_0$, the empty sum, is then the base
  case of every induction, and no index outside $\mathbb{N}$ is ever needed.

## Definition

A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals **converges** to $x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for
every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with
$|x_k - x| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$. It is **Cauchy** when for

## Remarks

- Quantifying over rational $\varepsilon$ loses nothing: below any real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ lies a positive rational ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).
- $|\cdot|$ is the absolute value of [[def-real-order]].

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]],
[[def-real-numbers]]) with its order and absolute value ([[def-real-order]]), and
$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers with its order ([[def-natural-numbers]],
[[def-nat-order]]).

A **sequence of reals** is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$. We write
$x_k$ for the value $x(k)$, call it the **$k$-th term**, and write $(x_k)$, or
$(x_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$, for the function itself. The **range** of $(x_k)$ is
the subset $\{\, x_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals and let $P$ be a property of indices.

- $(x_k)$ is **bounded** if there is $M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for
  every $k \in \mathbb{N}$; it is **unbounded** otherwise.
- $P$ holds **eventually** if there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $P(k)$ holds
  for every $k \ge K$.
- $P$ holds **frequently** if for every $K \in \mathbb{N}$ there is some
  $k \ge K$ for which $P(k)$ holds.
- For $K \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$K$-th tail** of $(x_k)$ is the sequence
  $x^{(K)}$ defined by $x^{(K)}_j := x_{j + K}$ for $j \in \mathbb{N}$; it is
  again a sequence of reals.
- A function $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is **strictly increasing** if
  $n_j < n_k$ whenever $j < k$. For such an $n$, the **subsequence** of $(x_k)$
  along $n$ is the composite $x \circ n$, written $(x_{n_k})_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$;
  it is again a sequence of reals.

**Convergence and Cauchyness are not defined here.** They are already fixed, for
sequences of reals, by the published [[def-real-limit]]: $(x_k)$ *converges* to
$x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is
$K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$, and $(x_k)$
is *Cauchy* when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$
with $|x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$. This page builds the
toolkit for those two notions and does not restate them. A sequence
**converges** if it converges to some real, and **diverges** if it does not.

## Remarks

- **Identification of $\mathbb{Q}$ with its image.** The map $q \mapsto \hat q$
  is an embedding of ordered fields ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and as is
  standard we write $q$ for $\hat q$, so that a rational may be compared with a
  real without further comment. [[def-real-limit]] is stated with the hat; every
  rational $\varepsilon$ occurring on this page is its image under this
  embedding.

- **Rational and real $\varepsilon$ agree.** [[def-real-limit]] tests convergence
  against every *rational* $\varepsilon > 0$, and its own remark records that
  this loses nothing. Spelled out: suppose that for every rational
  $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all
  $k \ge K$, and let $\eta > 0$ be an arbitrary *real*. Since $0 < \eta$,
  density of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) supplies a
  rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, and the index $K$
  belonging to that $\varepsilon$ satisfies $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon < \eta$ for
  all $k \ge K$. The converse implication is immediate, since every positive
  rational is a positive real. So the two formulations define the same relation,
  and the same two lines apply verbatim to the Cauchy condition and to any
  condition of the shape "for every $\varepsilon > 0$, eventually
  $\cdots < \varepsilon$". Proofs on this page therefore run the test with a real
  $\varepsilon$ wherever that is more convenient, and say so by citing this
  remark; nothing is smuggled in.

- **Constant sequences converge.** For $c \in \mathbb{R}$ the constant sequence
  $x_k := c$ converges to $c$, because $|x_k - c| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ for
  every $\varepsilon > 0$ and every $k$; it is bounded by $|c|$.

- **Eventually and frequently are dual.** $P$ holds frequently exactly when
  $\lnot P$ does not hold eventually, and $P$ holds eventually exactly when
  $\lnot P$ does not hold frequently. So the two quantifier patterns are
  negations of one another applied to the complementary property, and there is no
  third pattern hiding between them.

- **A sequence is not its range.** $(x_k)$ is a function, not a set, and the
  range does not determine the function: the sequence $x_0 = 0$, $x_k = 1$ for
  $k \ge 1$ and the sequence $y_0 = y_1 = 0$, $y_k = 1$ for $k \ge 2$ have the
  same range $\{0, 1\}$, yet they differ at $k = 1$, so they are different
  sequences. Order and repetition are part of the data and the range forgets
  both. Boundedness, on the other hand, depends only on the range.

- **Indexing.** Sequences here start at $k = 0$ because $\mathbb{N}$ contains
  $0$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]). Texts that index from $1$ describe the same
  objects up to a shift, and the shift changes nothing about convergence, by
  [[lem-limit-of-tail]].

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-real-numbers]]) and
a **sequence of reals** is a function $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$
([[def-sequence]]), written $(a_k)$; recall that $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$.

**Partial sums.** Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals. Its **sequence of partial
sums** is

$$s_n \;:=\; \sum_{k < n} a_k \qquad (n \in \mathbb{N}),$$

the finite sum of [[def-finite-sum]]. In particular $s_0 = 0$, the empty sum, and
$s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ for every $n$, those being exactly the two recursion clauses
that define the finite sum. Note that $s_n$ is the sum of the $n$ terms
$a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$, so the index $n$ counts terms rather than naming the last
one.

**Convergence, the sum, divergence.** The **series** of $(a_k)$, written
$\sum a_k$, **converges** when the sequence $(s_n)$ of partial sums converges
([[def-real-limit]]), and then the **sum of the series** is

$$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k \;:=\; \lim_{n} s_n .$$

The series **diverges** when $(s_n)$ does not converge. A convergent sequence of
reals has exactly one limit ([[lem-limit-unique]]), so the displayed symbol names
a single real number and nothing further has to be checked for it to be
well defined.

**Series with a general starting index.** Let $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $a$ be a
function on $\{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : k \ge m \,\}$, which we call a **family from
$m$** and write $(a_k)_{k \ge m}$. The series

$$\sum_{k \ge m} a_k$$

is by definition the series of the sequence $b_j := a_{j + m}$,
$j \in \mathbb{N}$, which is a genuine sequence of reals; it converges exactly
when that series converges, and its sum is then written
$\sum_{k = m}^{\infty} a_k$. Its partial sums are

$$\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k \;=\; \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j} \qquad (n \ge m),$$

in the notation of [[def-finite-sum]], the value at $n = m$ being the empty sum
$0$. A sequence on $\mathbb{N}$ is the case $m = 0$, and the two readings of
$\sum a_k$ agree there, since $b_j = a_j$.

**This clause is not a convenience.** Sequences in this library are functions on
$\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$ ([[def-sequence]]), while many of the
classical series are built from expressions that are undefined at the index $0$:
$1/k$, $1/k^{p}$ and $|a_k|^{1/k}$ all require $k \ge 1$. Writing such a series as
$\sum_{k \ge 1} a_k$ names an honest object, whereas writing it as a sequence on
$\mathbb{N}$ would require a value at an index where the defining expression has
none. Every statement on this page says which starting index it uses.

**Tail series.** For $N \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$N$-th tail series** of
$\sum a_k$ is $\sum_{k \ge N} a_k$, that is the series of the $N$-th tail
$a^{(N)}$ of [[def-sequence]], whose terms are $a^{(N)}_j = a_{j+N}$. The
$0$-th tail series is the series itself.

## Remarks

- **"Diverges" here means "does not converge", and nothing more.** A divergent
  series may have partial sums that run away to $+\infty$, or to $-\infty$, or
  that oscillate without settling anywhere. The three behaviours are not
  distinguished by the word, and no statement on this page uses "diverges" to
  mean "the partial sums are unbounded" unless it says so.

- **The symbol $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k$ is defined only for a convergent
  series.** It denotes a real number, not a formal object, and it is illegitimate
  to write it down before convergence has been established. Where a proof needs
  to speak of the series without knowing whether it converges, it speaks of
  $(a_k)$ and of $(s_n)$.

- **Two indices, doing different work.** The index $k$ runs over the terms and is
  bound; the index $n$ runs over the partial sums and is the variable in which the
  limit is taken. Confusing them is the commonest slip in the subject, and it is
  the reason the definition above fixes $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ rather than
  $\sum_{k \le n} a_k$: with this choice the recursion $s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ is
  the one supplied by [[def-finite-sum]], with no shift anywhere.

## Statement

**False claim:** for every sequence $(a_k)$ of reals, if $(a_k)$ converges to $0$
([[def-real-limit]]) then $\sum a_k$ converges ([[def-series]]).

What is true is the converse implication, [[lem-nth-term-test]]: a convergent
series has terms tending to $0$. The claim above reverses it, and the reversal
fails at the very first place one looks, the harmonic series.

The witness is $a_k := 1/(k+1)$ for $k \in \mathbb{N}$, which is the family
$1/k$, $k \ge 1$, written as a sequence on $\mathbb{N}$; by [[def-series]] the
series of this sequence is exactly $\sum_{k \ge 1} 1/k$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The sequence $a_k := 1/\iota(k+1)$, $k \in \mathbb{N}$, where $\iota(k+1)$ is the canonical natural, positive for every $k$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L1] For every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]]); and $0 < x \le y$ implies $0 < 1/y \le 1/x$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

[L2] Convergence to $0$ means: for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with $|a_k| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$ ([[def-real-limit]]).

[L3] $\sum_{k \ge 1} 1/k^{p}$ converges if and only if $p > 1$; and $k^{1} = \iota(k)$, the rational power at exponent $1$ being the element itself ([[thm-p-series-rational]], [[def-rational-power]], [[thm-nth-roots-exist]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L4] The series $\sum_{k \ge 1} x_k$ from the starting index $1$ is by definition the series of the sequence $j \mapsto x_{j+1}$ ([[def-series]]).

[L5] The refuted claim: for every sequence of reals converging to $0$, the associated series converges.

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Every term $a_k = 1/\iota(k+1)$ is a positive real, the canonical naturals $\iota(k+1)$ being positive. [given, L1]

1.2 The series of $(a_k)$ is $\sum_{k \ge 1} 1/k$, the series from starting index $1$ of the family $1/k$, since that series is by definition the series of $j \mapsto 1/\iota(j+1)$. [given, L4]

2.1 The sequence $(a_k)$ converges to $0$: given a rational $\varepsilon > 0$, choose a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$; then for every $k \ge n$ we have $\iota(k+1) \ge \iota(n)$, hence $|a_k| = 1/\iota(k+1) \le 1/n < \varepsilon$. [step 1.1, L1, L2, choose]

2.2 That series is the case $p = 1$ of the $p$-series, and $p = 1$ does not exceed $1$, so it diverges. [step 1.2, L3]

3.1 So $(a_k)$ converges to $0$ while $\sum a_k$ diverges, and the claim fails for this sequence. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L5]

4.1 The claim is therefore false, and what survives of it is only the converse implication, that a convergent series has null terms. [step 3.1, L5] ∎

## Remarks

- **The failure is not marginal.** The harmonic series has terms tending to $0$ and partial sums diverging to $+\infty$, so no weakening of the false claim to "the partial sums are bounded" would rescue it either. The rate at which the terms tend to $0$ is what decides convergence, and the term test reads no rate at all.

- **The other tests use rate information that the term test ignores.** The
  $p$-series theorem distinguishes $1/k$ from $1/k^2$. The basic root and
  ratio tests do not: for both sequences their relevant limit is the boundary
  value $1$, so those two tests are inconclusive.

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]), let $x \in \mathbb{R}$,
and for $K \in \mathbb{N}$ let $x^{(K)}$ denote the $K$-th tail, $x^{(K)}_j =
x_{j+K}$. The following are equivalent ([[def-real-limit]]):

1. $(x_k)$ converges to $x$;
2. every tail $x^{(K)}$ converges to $x$;
3. some tail $x^{(K)}$ converges to $x$.

The same three statements with "converges to $x$" replaced by "is Cauchy" are
likewise equivalent. Consequently, if two sequences agree from some index on,
then either both converge to $x$ or neither does, and either both are Cauchy or
neither is.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals, a real $x$, and for each $K \in \mathbb{N}$ the $K$-th tail $x^{(K)}$ defined by $x^{(K)}_j := x_{j+K}$ ([[def-sequence]]).

[L1] Convergence and the Cauchy condition: $(z_k)$ converges to $z$ when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $N$ with $|z_k - z| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge N$, and $(z_k)$ is Cauchy when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $N$ with $|z_k - z_l| < \varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge N$ ([[def-real-limit]]).

[L2] Index arithmetic, first half: $j \ge N$ implies $j + K \ge N + K$, and $N + K \ge N$ ([[def-nat-order]], [[lem-nat-order-add-compatible]]).

[L3] Index arithmetic, second half: every $k \ge N + K$ has the form $k = j + K$ with $j \ge N$. Indeed $N + K \le k$ gives $i$ with $(N+K) + i = k$; put $j := N + i$, so that $j \ge N$ and $j + K = (N+i) + K = N + (i + K) = N + (K + i) = (N+K) + i = k$ ([[def-nat-order]], [[lem-nat-add-associative]], [[lem-nat-add-commutative]]).

[L4] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is reflexive and transitive, so $k \ge N + K \ge N$ gives $k \ge N$; and $j + 0 = j$ for every $j$ ([[thm-nat-linear-order]], [[def-nat-order]], [[def-nat-addition]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 (1) implies (2). Assume $(x_k)$ converges to $x$, let $K \in \mathbb{N}$ be arbitrary and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be rational; take $N$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge N$. For every $j \ge N$ we have $j + K \ge N + K \ge N$, hence $|x^{(K)}_j - x| = |x_{j+K} - x| < \varepsilon$; so $x^{(K)}$ converges to $x$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2, L4]

1.2 (2) implies (3), in both families. The $0$-th tail satisfies $x^{(0)}_j = x_{j+0} = x_j$, so $(x_k)$ is itself one of its own tails; statement (2) quantifies over all tails, so applying it to this one already yields (3). [given, L4]

1.3 (3) implies (1). Assume $x^{(K)}$ converges to $x$ for some fixed $K$, and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be rational; take $N$ with $|x^{(K)}_j - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $j \ge N$. Every $k \ge N + K$ is of the form $j + K$ with $j \ge N$, so $|x_k - x| = |x^{(K)}_j - x| < \varepsilon$; taking $N + K$ as the threshold shows $(x_k)$ converges to $x$. [assume-hyp, L1, L3]

1.4 The Cauchy version of (1) implies (2). Assume $(x_k)$ is Cauchy, fix $K$ and a rational $\varepsilon > 0$, and take $N$ with $|x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge N$. For $i, j \ge N$ both $i + K \ge N$ and $j + K \ge N$, so $|x^{(K)}_i - x^{(K)}_j| = |x_{i+K} - x_{j+K}| < \varepsilon$; so $x^{(K)}$ is Cauchy. [assume-hyp, L1, L2, L4]

1.5 The Cauchy version of (3) implies (1). Assume $x^{(K)}$ is Cauchy and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be rational; take $N$ with $|x^{(K)}_i - x^{(K)}_j| < \varepsilon$ for all $i, j \ge N$. Any $k, l \ge N + K$ are of the form $i + K$ and $j + K$ with $i, j \ge N$, so $|x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon$; so $(x_k)$ is Cauchy. [assume-hyp, L1, L3]

2.1 In each of the two families the cycle (1) implies (2) implies (3) implies (1) is closed, so within each family the three statements are equivalent. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, step 1.4, step 1.5]

3.1 If $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ agree from index $K$ on, then $x^{(K)} = y^{(K)}$ as functions, so by the established equivalence $(x_k)$ converges to $x$ exactly when $y^{(K)}$ does, exactly when $(y_k)$ does, and the same chain applies to the Cauchy condition. [step 2.1, given] ∎

## Remarks

- This is the lemma that makes the word "eventually" usable. Once it is known that finitely many initial terms are irrelevant, a hypothesis of the form "$P(k)$ for all $k$" can everywhere be weakened to "$P(k)$ eventually" ([[def-sequence]]) at the cost of passing to a tail.

- It also settles the bookkeeping question of where the indexing starts. A text that writes $(x_k)_{k \ge 1}$ is describing the first tail of a sequence in the sense used here, and the two have the same limits and the same Cauchy status.

- Boundedness, by contrast, is *not* a tail property in the same trivial way: a tail of a bounded sequence is bounded, and a sequence with a bounded tail is bounded only because the finitely many omitted terms can be absorbed into the bound, which is exactly the argument of [[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]].

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ be sequences of reals ([[def-sequence]]) converging to
$x$ and $y$ respectively ([[def-real-limit]]), and let $c \in \mathbb{R}$. Then

$$x_k + y_k \to x + y, \qquad c\,x_k \to c\,x, \qquad x_k - y_k \to x - y, \qquad x_k y_k \to x y,$$

and if in addition $y \ne 0$ and $y_k \ne 0$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, then

$$\frac{1}{y_k} \to \frac{1}{y} \qquad \text{and} \qquad \frac{x_k}{y_k} \to \frac{x}{y}.$$

The quotient case rests on an eventual lower bound for $|y_k|$, proved below
rather than assumed: $|y_k| > |y|/2$ for all sufficiently large $k$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $(x_k)$, $(y_k)$ of reals with $(x_k)$ converging to $x$ and $(y_k)$ converging to $y$, and a real $c$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]). For the last two claims we assume in addition $y \ne 0$ and $y_k \ne 0$ for every $k$.

[L1] Convergence, quantified over rational $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-real-limit]]).

[L2] Absolute value and the triangle inequality: $|uv| = |u|\,|v|$, $|u| \ge 0$, $|u| = 0$ if and only if $u = 0$, $|-u| = |u|$, and $|a + b| \le |a| + |b|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L3] Real versus rational $\varepsilon$: for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, by density ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) or by the Archimedean property ([[thm-of-archimedean]]) applied to $1/\eta$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]); consequently the convergence test of [[def-real-limit]] may equivalently be run with real $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-sequence]]).

[L4] Convergent sequences are bounded ([[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]]), and a constant sequence $(c)$ is bounded by $|c|$ ([[def-sequence]]).

[L5] A null sequence times a bounded sequence is null ([[lem-null-times-bounded]]).

[L6] Reverse triangle inequality: $\bigl||u| - |v|\bigr| \le |u - v|$, hence $|u| \ge |v| - |v - u|$ ([[cor-of-reverse-triangle]]).

[L7] Inverses and order: $a > 0$ implies $a^{-1} > 0$; $0 < a < b$ implies $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$; $(u^{-1})^{-1} = u$ for $u \ne 0$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-field]]).

[L8] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: adding a constant and adding inequalities preserve the order, multiplying a strict inequality by a positive factor preserves it, and $\le$ and $<$ compose transitively; trichotomy holds, and since $u \ge 0$ means $u > 0$ or $u = 0$, an element with $u \ge 0$ and $u \ne 0$ satisfies $u > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]). Moreover $2 = 1 + 1 > 0$ and $2$ is invertible: $0 < 1$ in any ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]) and the positives are closed under addition, so $2 > 0$ and in particular $2 \ne 0$ ([[def-ordered-field]]), whence $2^{-1}$ exists ([[def-field]]).

[L9] Rational arithmetic: $\varepsilon/2$ is a rational $> 0$ whenever $\varepsilon$ is, and $\varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$ ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]); the order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total, so finitely many thresholds admit a common index ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Reduction to null sequences: for any sequence $(z_k)$ of reals and any real $z$, the statements "$(z_k)$ converges to $z$" and "$(z_k - z)$ converges to $0$" are literally the same condition, because $|(z_k - z) - 0| = |z_k - z|$ for every $k$. [L1, L2]

1.2 Sum rule, in general form. Let $(u_k) \to u$ and $(v_k) \to v$ be any convergent sequences of reals and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be rational; take $K_1$ with $|u_k - u| < \varepsilon/2$ for $k \ge K_1$ and $K_2$ with $|v_k - v| < \varepsilon/2$ for $k \ge K_2$, and let $K$ be an index at least as large as both. For $k \ge K$, $|(u_k + v_k) - (u + v)| = |(u_k - u) + (v_k - v)| \le |u_k - u| + |v_k - v| < \varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$; hence $u_k + v_k \to u + v$, and in particular $x_k + y_k \to x + y$. [L1, L2, L8, L9, algebra]

1.3 Boundedness: every convergent sequence of reals is bounded, and every constant sequence $(d)$ is bounded by $|d|$. [L4]

1.4 Quotient preparation. Assume $y \ne 0$ and $y_k \ne 0$ for every $k$. Then $|y| > 0$ by [L2], so $|y|/2 > 0$; running the convergence test of $(y_k)$ with the real number $|y|/2$ as tolerance, which [L3] licenses, produces $K_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|y_k - y| < |y|/2$ for all $k \ge K_0$. [L1, L2, L3, L7, L8, choose]

2.1 Scalar rule, in general form. Let $(u_k) \to u$ and let $d \in \mathbb{R}$. By step 1.1 the sequence $(u_k - u)$ is null and by step 1.3 the constant sequence $(d)$ is bounded, so $(d(u_k - u)) = (d u_k - d u)$ is null by [L5]; by step 1.1 again, $d u_k \to d u$, and in particular $c x_k \to c x$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, L5, algebra]

2.2 Product rule, in general form. Let $(u_k) \to u$ and $(v_k) \to v$, and write $u_k v_k - u v = u_k(v_k - v) + v(u_k - u)$. By step 1.1 both $(v_k - v)$ and $(u_k - u)$ are null; by step 1.3 both $(u_k)$ and the constant sequence $(v)$ are bounded; so both $(u_k(v_k - v))$ and $(v(u_k - u))$ are null by [L5], and their sum is null by step 1.2 applied with both limits equal to $0$. By step 1.1, $u_k v_k \to u v$, and in particular $x_k y_k \to x y$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, L5, algebra]

2.3 Eventual lower bound. For every $k \ge K_0$, the reverse triangle inequality gives $|y_k| \ge |y| - |y - y_k| = |y| - |y_k - y| > |y| - |y|/2 = |y|/2 > 0$; so $|y_k| > |y|/2$ for all $k \ge K_0$, and in particular $|y_k| \ne 0$ there. [step 1.4, L2, L6, L8]

3.1 Difference rule. Applying step 2.1 to the sequence $(y_k)$ with $d = -1$ gives $-y_k \to -y$; the sum rule of step 1.2 applied to $(x_k)$ and $(-y_k)$ then gives $x_k - y_k = x_k + (-y_k) \to x + (-y) = x - y$. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L8, algebra]

3.2 Reciprocal estimate. For $k \ge K_0$ we have $y_k \ne 0$ and $|y_k| > |y|/2 > 0$, so [L7] applied to $0 < |y|/2 < |y_k|$ gives $0 < |y_k|^{-1} < 2/|y|$, and therefore $\left|\dfrac{1}{y_k} - \dfrac{1}{y}\right| = \dfrac{|y - y_k|}{|y_k|\,|y|} \le \dfrac{2}{|y|^2}\,|y_k - y|$. [step 2.3, L2, L7, L8, algebra]

4.1 Reciprocal rule. Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real and put $\eta := \varepsilon |y|^2/2$, a real $> 0$; by [L3] there is $K_1$ with $|y_k - y| < \eta$ for all $k \ge K_1$. For every $k$ at least as large as both $K_0$ and $K_1$, step 3.2 gives $\left|\dfrac{1}{y_k} - \dfrac{1}{y}\right| \le \dfrac{2}{|y|^2}|y_k - y| < \dfrac{2}{|y|^2}\,\eta = \varepsilon$; hence $1/y_k \to 1/y$. [step 3.2, L1, L3, L7, L8, L9, algebra]

5.1 Quotient rule. By step 4.1 the sequence $(1/y_k)$ converges to $1/y$, so the product rule of step 2.2 applied to $(x_k)$ and $(1/y_k)$ gives $x_k/y_k = x_k \cdot (1/y_k) \to x \cdot (1/y) = x/y$. [step 2.2, step 4.1, algebra]

6.1 All the claims are established: the sum rule in step 1.2, the scalar rule in step 2.1, the difference rule in step 3.1, the product rule in step 2.2, and the reciprocal and quotient rules in steps 4.1 and 5.1. [step 1.2, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, step 4.1, step 5.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The quotient case is where proofs usually cheat.** The estimate $|1/y_k - 1/y| = |y - y_k| / (|y_k||y|)$ is worthless until $|y_k|$ is known to stay away from $0$: without a lower bound the denominator can be arbitrarily small and the fraction arbitrarily large, even while $|y - y_k|$ shrinks. Step 2.3 supplies that bound, $|y_k| > |y|/2$ for $k \ge K_0$, and it is proved from the reverse triangle inequality, not assumed.

- The hypothesis $y_k \ne 0$ for every $k$ is only there so that $1/y_k$ is defined for every index. It is not needed for the limit: step 2.3 shows $|y_k| > |y|/2 > 0$ from $K_0$ on, so a sequence with $y \ne 0$ has at most finitely many zero terms, and by [[lem-limit-of-tail]] one may pass to the $K_0$-th tail and read the conclusion there.

- The hypothesis $y \ne 0$ cannot be dropped. With $x_k = 1$ and $y_k = 1/(k+1)$, both sequences converge: the first is constant ([[def-sequence]]) and the second is null ([[fs-limit-preserves-strict-inequality]]), so $y = 0$. Yet $x_k/y_k = k+1$, and no real $M$ bounds every $k+1$, by the Archimedean property ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); so the quotient sequence is unbounded, hence not convergent by [[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]].

- Nothing in the proof uses completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ beyond the Archimedean property invoked in [L3], so the same rules hold verbatim for sequences of rationals.
