## Statement

Every filter converging in the induced topology of a uniform space is Cauchy.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A filter $\mathcal F$ converging to $x$ in a uniform space.

[L1] Filter convergence means that every neighbourhood of the limit belongs to the filter ([[def-filter-convergence-and-cluster-point]]).

[L2] Entourage balls form neighbourhood bases, and every entourage has a symmetric square root ([[thm-uniformity-induces-a-topology]], [[def-uniform-space-by-entourages]], [[lem-symmetric-entourages-form-a-base]]).

[L3] A Cauchy filter has an $E$-small member for every entourage $E$ ([[def-cauchy-filter-in-a-uniform-space]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $E$ be an entourage and choose a symmetric entourage $D$ with $D\circ D\subseteq E$. [L2, choose]

1.2 The neighbourhood $D[x]$ belongs to $\mathcal F$ by convergence. [L1, L2]

2.1 Since $D$ is symmetric, $D[x]\times D[x]\subseteq D^{-1}\circ D=D\circ D\subseteq E$, so $D[x]$ is $E$-small. [step 1.1, step 1.2]

3.1 As $E$ was arbitrary, $\mathcal F$ is Cauchy by [L3]. [step 2.1, L3] ∎

## Definition

Let $\mathcal F$ be a filter on a topological space $X$ and let $p\in X$.

- $\mathcal F$ **converges to $p$**, written $\mathcal F\to p$, if every neighbourhood of $p$ belongs to $\mathcal F$.
- $p$ is a **cluster point** of $\mathcal F$ if $N\cap A\ne\varnothing$ for every neighbourhood $N$ of $p$ and every $A\in\mathcal F$.

The second condition says precisely that the neighbourhood filter at $p$ and $\mathcal F$ have no disjoint members.

## Definition

Let $X$ be a set and write $\Delta_X=\{(x,x):x\in X\}$ for its diagonal ([[def-the-diagonal-of-a-space]]). For $E\subseteq X\times X$, put $E[x]:=\{y\in X:(x,y)\in E\}$, $E^{-1}:=\{(y,x):(x,y)\in E\}$, and $E\circ F:=\{(x,z):\text{some }y\text{ has }(x,y)\in E,(y,z)\in F\}$.

A **uniformity** on $X$ is a filter $\mathcal U$ on $X\times X$ ([[def-filter]]) such that:

- every $E\in\mathcal U$ contains $\Delta_X$;
- $E\in\mathcal U$ implies $E^{-1}\in\mathcal U$;
- for every $E\in\mathcal U$ there is $D\in\mathcal U$ with $D\circ D\subseteq E$.

Its members are **entourages**. A **uniform space** is a set equipped with a uniformity. The induced topology and its neighbourhoods are constructed in [[thm-uniformity-induces-a-topology]].

## Statement

If $\mathcal U$ is a uniformity on $X$, then its symmetric entourages form a filter base: for every $E\in\mathcal U$ there is a symmetric $D\in\mathcal U$ with $D\subseteq E$. More generally, for every entourage $E$ and every integer $n\ge 1$, there is a symmetric entourage $D$ whose $n$-fold composite satisfies $D^{\circ n}\subseteq E$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A uniformity $\mathcal U$ on $X$, an entourage $E\in\mathcal U$, and an integer $n\ge 1$.

[A1] A uniformity is a filter whose members are closed under inverse and admit square roots ([[def-uniform-space-by-entourages]]).

[L1] A nonempty, proper family that refines every pair of its members is a filter base ([[def-filter-base]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Choose $R\in\mathcal U$ with $R\circ R\subseteq E$, and put $S:=R\cap R^{-1}$. [A1, choose]

1.2 Put $E_0:=E$. By finitely iterating the square-root axiom, choose entourages $E_1,\ldots,E_n$ such that $E_{k+1}\circ E_{k+1}\subseteq E_k$ for $0\le k<n$, and put $D:=E_n\cap E_n^{-1}$. [A1, choose]

2.1 The set $S$ is an entourage, since $R,R^{-1}\in\mathcal U$ and a filter is closed under intersections; also $S=S^{-1}$ and $S\subseteq R\circ R\subseteq E$, because every entourage contains the diagonal. [step 1.1, A1]

2.2 The entourage $D$ is symmetric and $D\subseteq E_n$. Induction on $k$ gives $D^{\circ 2^k}\subseteq E_{n-k}$ for $0\le k\le n$, hence $D^{\circ 2^n}\subseteq E$. Since every entourage contains the diagonal and $n\le 2^n$, one may insert diagonal factors to obtain $D^{\circ n}\subseteq D^{\circ 2^n}\subseteq E$. [step 1.2, A1, algebra]

3.1 Thus symmetric entourages refine every entourage; their intersections are symmetric entourages and none is empty because each contains the diagonal, so they form a filter base by [L1]. [step 2.1, L1]

4.1 Therefore symmetric entourages form a base and admit the asserted finite-composite control. [step 3.1, step 2.2] ∎

## Statement

For a uniformity $\mathcal U$ on $X$, call $O\subseteq X$ open when every $x\in O$ has an entourage $E$ with $E[x]\subseteq O$. These open sets form a topology on $X$. Its neighbourhood filter at $x$ has $\{E[x]:E\in\mathcal U\}$ as a base.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A uniform space $(X,\mathcal U)$.

[A1] Entourages contain the diagonal, are closed under finite intersection, and have symmetric square roots ([[def-uniform-space-by-entourages]], [[lem-symmetric-entourages-form-a-base]]).

[L1] A topology contains $\varnothing,X$, is closed under arbitrary unions, and under binary intersections ([[def-topological-space]]).

[L2] A neighbourhood base at $x$ refines every neighbourhood of $x$ ([[def-neighbourhood-top]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The sets $\varnothing$ and $X$ are open: the first has no points to test, and for $x\in X$ every entourage ball is contained in $X$. [A1]

1.2 An arbitrary union of open sets is open, because a point in the union lies in one member and retains that member's entourage ball. [A1]

1.3 If $x\in O\cap P$, choose entourage balls $E[x]\subseteq O$ and $F[x]\subseteq P$; then $(E\cap F)[x]\subseteq O\cap P$, so binary intersections are open. [A1]

2.1 By steps 1.1 to 1.3, the open sets form a topology by [L1]. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, L1]

3.1 Let $E$ be an entourage and define $$ O_E=\{y\in E[x]:F[y]\subseteq E[x]\text{ for some }F\in\mathcal U\}. $$ This set is open. Indeed, given $y\in O_E$, choose $F$ as displayed and then a symmetric $G$ with $G\circ G\subseteq F$. If $z\in G[y]$, symmetry gives $G[z]\subseteq(G\circ G)[y]\subseteq F[y]\subseteq E[x]$, so $z\in O_E$; hence $G[y]\subseteq O_E$. Now choose a symmetric $D$ with $D\circ D\subseteq E$. If $y\in D[x]$, then $D[y]\subseteq E[x]$, so $y\in O_E$. Thus $x\in D[x]\subseteq O_E\subseteq E[x]$, proving that $E[x]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$. [A1, step 2.1]

4.1 Conversely, if $N$ is a neighbourhood of $x$, it contains an open set $O$ with $x\in O$; the definition of the topology supplies an entourage $E$ with $E[x]\subseteq O\subseteq N$. Thus the entourage balls refine every neighbourhood, and by step 3.1 they are themselves neighbourhoods. They form a neighbourhood base by [L2]. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L2] ∎
