## Statement

**Assume the Axiom of Dependent Choice** ([[def-dependent-choice]]). Let
$(X,\mathcal{T})$ be compact ([[def-compact-space]]) and Hausdorff
([[def-hausdorff-space]]). Then $X$ is Tychonoff
([[def-completely-regular-and-tychonoff-spaces]]), and any two disjoint closed
subsets of $X$ are separated by a continuous function into $[0,1]$ in the sense
of [[thm-urysohn-lemma]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A compact Hausdorff topological space $(X,\mathcal{T})$, and dependent choice.

[L1] A compact Hausdorff space is regular and normal, hence $T_3$ and $T_4$ ([[thm-a-compact-hausdorff-space-is-regular-and-normal]]).

[L2] Under dependent choice, a normal $T_1$ space is completely regular ([[cor-urysohns-lemma-closes-the-separation-chain]]).

[L3] Under dependent choice, if $X$ is normal and $P,Q \subseteq X$ are disjoint closed sets, there is a continuous $f : X \to [0,1]$ with $P \subseteq f^{-1}(\{0\})$, $Q \subseteq f^{-1}(\{1\})$ ([[thm-urysohn-lemma]]).

[L4] Tychonoff means completely regular and $T_1$ ([[def-completely-regular-and-tychonoff-spaces]], [[def-t0-and-t1-spaces]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $X$ is compact and Hausdorff (given); by [L1], $X$ is regular and normal, hence $T_3$ and $T_4$, that is, in particular, normal and $T_1$. [given, L1]

2.1 By [L2] applied to step 1.1 (normal and $T_1$), $X$ is completely regular. [step 1.1, L2]

2.2 Let $A, B \subseteq X$ be disjoint closed sets; by [L3] applied to step 1.1 (normal), fix a continuous $f : X \to [0,1]$ with $A \subseteq f^{-1}(\{0\})$ and $B \subseteq f^{-1}(\{1\})$. [step 1.1, L3, choose]

3.1 By step 1.1 ($T_1$) and step 2.1 (completely regular), $X$ is Tychonoff by [L4]. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L4]

4.1 Steps 3.1 and 2.2 establish the two clauses of the statement. [step 3.1, step 2.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Nothing here is new mathematics.** This item exists so that "compact Hausdorff" has a one-step citation to both Tychonoff-ness and to Urysohn separation, rather than requiring every citing page to chain [[thm-a-compact-hausdorff-space-is-regular-and-normal]] through [[cor-urysohns-lemma-closes-the-separation-chain]] or [[thm-urysohn-lemma]] by hand.

## Statement

**Assume the Axiom of Dependent Choice** ([[def-dependent-choice]]). If
$(X,\mathcal{T})$ is normal and $T_1$, that is $T_4$
([[def-normal-and-t4-spaces]], [[def-t0-and-t1-spaces]]), then $X$ is
completely regular ([[def-completely-regular-and-tychonoff-spaces]]). Since $X$
is also $T_1$, $X$ is Tychonoff, and $T_4 \Rightarrow T_{3\frac12}$.

Combined with [[thm-the-separation-implication-chain]], every arrow of

$$T_6 \Rightarrow T_5 \Rightarrow T_4 \Rightarrow T_{3\frac12} \Rightarrow T_3 \Rightarrow T_{2\frac12} \Rightarrow T_2 \Rightarrow T_1 \Rightarrow T_0$$

now holds: the first arrow under the Axiom of Countable Choice
([[def-countable-choice]]), the arrow $T_4 \Rightarrow T_{3\frac12}$ proved here
under dependent choice, and every other arrow with no choice principle at all.
No arrow of this chain is asserted to reverse.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A normal, $T_1$ topological space $(X,\mathcal{T})$, a closed set $C \subseteq X$, and a point $x_0 \in X \setminus C$.

[A1] $X$ is normal ([[def-normal-and-t4-spaces]]) and $T_1$ ([[def-t0-and-t1-spaces]]).

[L1] In a $T_1$ space every singleton is closed ([[thm-t1-iff-singletons-are-closed]], clause (b)).

[L2] Urysohn's lemma, clause 1: assuming DC, if $X$ is normal and $P, Q \subseteq X$ are disjoint closed sets, there is a continuous $h : X \to [0,1]$ with $P \subseteq h^{-1}(\{0\})$ and $Q \subseteq h^{-1}(\{1\})$ ([[thm-urysohn-lemma]]).

[L3] $X$ is completely regular when for every closed $C$ and every $x_0 \in X \setminus C$ there is a continuous $f : X \to [0,1]$ with $f(x_0) = 1$ and $f \equiv 0$ on $C$ ([[def-completely-regular-and-tychonoff-spaces]]).

[L4] Clauses 3 and 4 of [[thm-the-separation-implication-chain]]: normal with $T_1$ implies $T_3$; completely regular implies regular, and Tychonoff implies $T_3$; and clauses 1, 2 and 5 give the remaining arrows of the displayed chain, clause 1 — perfectly normal implies completely normal, that is $T_6 \Rightarrow T_5$ — under the Axiom of Countable Choice.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $\{x_0\}$ is closed, since $X$ is $T_1$ by [A1]. [A1, L1]

1.2 $\{x_0\} \cap C = \varnothing$, since $x_0 \notin C$. [given]

2.1 By [A1] $X$ is normal, so [L2] applies to the disjoint closed sets $C$ and $\{x_0\}$: there is a continuous $f : X \to [0,1]$ with $C \subseteq f^{-1}(\{0\})$ and $\{x_0\} \subseteq f^{-1}(\{1\})$, that is $f \equiv 0$ on $C$ and $f(x_0) = 1$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, A1, L2]

3.1 Since $C$ and $x_0 \notin C$ were arbitrary, step 2.1 exhibits, for every closed $C$ and every $x_0 \in X \setminus C$, a continuous $f : X \to [0,1]$ with $f(x_0)=1$ and $f \equiv 0$ on $C$; by [L3] this makes $X$ completely regular. [step 2.1, L3]

4.1 Since $X$ is also $T_1$ by [A1], $X$ is Tychonoff, so $T_4 \Rightarrow T_{3\frac12}$. [step 3.1, A1]

5.1 By [L4], $T_{3\frac12} \Rightarrow T_3 \Rightarrow T_{2\frac12} \Rightarrow T_2 \Rightarrow T_1 \Rightarrow T_0$ and $T_6 \Rightarrow T_5 \Rightarrow T_4$ all hold, the arrow $T_6 \Rightarrow T_5$ under countable choice; combined with step 4.1, every arrow of the displayed chain holds. [step 4.1, L4] ∎

## Remarks

- **This corollary supplies exactly the one arrow the published `separation-axioms` page could not reach.** That page's own `rem-separation-axiom-conventions` names the missing arrow as *normal $T_1$ implies completely regular* and records that no rearrangement of material already on that page could supply it, since the implication is Urysohn's lemma. Nothing in this corollary revisits or amends that page; it only supplies, at a later point in the reading order, the theorem that page named as absent.

- **The chain above is not asserted to be a theorem of ZF.** Its weakest link is this corollary's own dependent-choice hypothesis, and the first arrow separately costs countable choice; neither cost is removed by combining the arrows, and no clause of [[thm-the-separation-implication-chain]] is reproved here.

## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]).

- An **open cover** of $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a family
  $\mathcal{U} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$ of open sets with $X = \bigcup \mathcal{U}$,
  where $\bigcup \mathcal{U} = \{\, x \in X : x \in U \text{ for some } U \in \mathcal{U} \,\}$.
- A **subcover** of $\mathcal{U}$ is a subfamily $\mathcal{V} \subseteq \mathcal{U}$
  that is itself an open cover.
- A family $\mathcal{V}$ of sets is **finite** when $\mathcal{V} = \varnothing$ or
  there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and sets $V_0, \dots, V_n$ with
  $\mathcal{V} = \{V_0, \dots, V_n\}$; repetitions in the list are allowed and
  harmless.
- $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is **compact** when every open cover of it has a finite
  subcover: for every open cover $\mathcal{U}$, either $X = \varnothing$ and the
  empty subfamily covers it, or there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
  $U_0, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{U}$ with
  $$X = U_0 \cup \dots \cup U_n .$$
- A subset $A \subseteq X$ is a **compact subset** of $X$ when the subspace
  $(A, \mathcal{T}_A)$ is a compact topological space, $\mathcal{T}_A$ being the
  subspace topology ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]).

**Compactness of a subset is defined intrinsically, and only intrinsically.**
The last clause speaks about the subspace $(A, \mathcal{T}_A)$ and its own open
sets, not about families of open subsets of the ambient $X$. The two readings do
agree, but that is a theorem and not a convention: it is
[[lem-compactness-of-a-subspace-is-ambient]], and no item of this library may use
the ambient reading without citing it. Taking the intrinsic reading makes
compactness a property of the topological space $(A, \mathcal{T}_A)$ alone.
Hence it is preserved when $A$ is embedded homeomorphically as a subspace, or
when another ambient space induces the same topology on $A$; it need not be
preserved if the induced topology changes. This is exactly the convention already fixed for
metric spaces by [[def-metric-compactness]], and the agreement of that
definition with this one is [[thm-compactness-agrees-with-metric-compactness]].

**The empty space is compact**, since the empty subfamily of any family covers
it; this is the reason the clause above is written with the two cases. Every
space listed as $\{x_0, \dots, x_n\}$ is compact too: given a cover, each $x_i$
lies in some member, and finitely many members named in this way already cover.
So every finite space is compact, whatever its topology, and in particular the
discrete topology on a finite set is compact while the discrete topology on an
infinite set is not ([[def-standard-topologies]]).

**The finiteness convention.** "Finite" above is the listing form. It agrees with
the definition of finiteness by equinumerosity with a natural number
([[def-countable]]), in both directions, and the agreement is the one already
discharged in [[def-metric-compactness]]: a nonempty set equinumerous with
$m \ge 1$ is listable, and a set listed as $\{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$ injects into
$\sigma(n)$ by sending $x$ to the least $i \le n$ with $a_i = x$. Neither
direction uses a choice principle; the second selects nothing, taking a least
index instead.

**Quasicompact is not used here.** Some authors, following Bourbaki, reserve
*compact* for a space that is both compact in the above sense and Hausdorff, and
call the open-cover condition alone *quasicompact*. This library follows the more
widely adopted convention: **compact** means the open-cover condition and nothing
more, and a Hausdorff hypothesis is always written out. The fork is recorded in
[[rem-compactness-conventions-and-choice-ledger]].

## Remarks

**Why open covers rather than covers by arbitrary sets.** Nothing in the
definition would break if $\mathcal{U}$ were allowed to consist of arbitrary
subsets of $X$, but the resulting notion would be uninteresting: every space is
covered by its singletons, and only a finite space would survive. Openness of the
members is what makes the condition a genuine restriction, and it is what
[[lem-compactness-of-a-subspace-is-ambient]] has to keep track of when the
ambient space changes.

**A warning about the word "cover".** A family may cover $A \subseteq X$ without
being a family of subsets of $A$: the members are open subsets of $X$ and their
union merely contains $A$. That is the ambient reading, and it is a different
statement from "$\mathcal{U}$ is an open cover of the space
$(A, \mathcal{T}_A)$", whose members are open subsets of $A$. Which of the two is
meant is written out everywhere on this page.

## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]) and let
$[0,1] \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ carry the subspace topology of the usual topology of
$\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-interval]], [[def-subspace-topology-top]],
[[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]], [[def-metrizable-space]]).

- $X$ is **completely regular** when a point can be separated from a closed set
  not containing it *by a continuous function*: for every closed $C \subseteq X$
  and every $x_0 \in X \setminus C$ there is a continuous
  $f : X \to [0,1]$ ([[def-continuous-map-top]]) with
  $$f(x_0) = 1 \qquad \text{and} \qquad f(y) = 0 \ \text{ for every } y \in C .$$
- $X$ is **Tychonoff**, also written **$T_{3\frac{1}{2}}$** and *completely
  regular Hausdorff*, when it is completely regular **and** $T_1$
  ([[def-t0-and-t1-spaces]]).

The case $C = \varnothing$ is allowed and is satisfied by the constant function
$1$, which is continuous ([[def-zero-sets-and-cozero-sets]]); so the condition
hides no nonemptiness hypothesis.

**The same condition in the vocabulary of zero sets.** With $f$ as displayed,
$C \subseteq Z(f)$ and $x_0 \in \operatorname{coz}(f)$
([[def-zero-sets-and-cozero-sets]]), so complete regularity says: for every
closed $C$ and every $x_0 \notin C$ there is a continuous $f$ whose zero set
contains $C$ and whose cozero set contains $x_0$. In particular
$\operatorname{coz}(f)$ is an open set containing $x_0$ and disjoint from $C$;
that alone is weaker than regularity, and the passage from the function to two
*disjoint* open sets is the next item.

**The values $0$ and $1$ are a normalisation, not a restriction.** If
$g : X \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous with $g(x_0) = a$, $g[C] = \{b\}$ and
$a \ne b$, then the condition above is met by a function built from $g$ by an
affine change of variable followed by truncation into $[0,1]$; this page never
needs that construction, because every function it builds is already normalised.
The *direction* of the normalisation is a genuine convention and is fixed here as
$f(x_0) = 1$ and $f[C] = \{0\}$, following the most common usage; some texts
write the reverse, and a reader must check which is meant before quoting a
formula.

**The convention fork over $T_1$ is the same one as for regularity.** *Completely
regular* names the function-separation condition alone, and Tychonoff names the
conjunction with $T_1$ ([[def-regular-and-t3-spaces]]). The indiscrete topology
on a two-point set ([[def-standard-topologies]]) is completely regular, its only
closed set disjoint from a point being $\varnothing$, and it is not $T_0$; so the
two halves are independent here as well.

## Remarks

- **Complete regularity is a strong hypothesis in disguise.** It asserts the
  existence of many continuous real-valued functions, and a space may have almost
  none; producing such functions is what Urysohn's lemma does for normal $T_1$
  spaces, and that lemma is not available at this point in the reading order
  ([[rem-separation-axiom-conventions]]).

- **Why the numeral is $3\frac12$.** Complete regularity implies regularity, as
  the next item proves, and every normal $T_1$ space is completely regular, which
  this page does **not** prove; so the axiom sits between $T_3$ and $T_4$, and
  the fractional numeral records that position and nothing more.

- **Both names are in use for the conjunction.** *Tychonoff*, *completely regular
  Hausdorff* and *$T_{3\frac12}$* denote the same class; this library writes
  Tychonoff.

## Definition

Let $X$ be a set and let $R \subseteq X \times X$ be a binary relation on $X$.
Call $R$ **entire on $X$** when

$$\text{for every } x \in X \text{ there is } y \in X \text{ with } x \mathbin{R} y .$$

The **Axiom of Dependent Choice**, written $\mathrm{DC}$, is the following
statement.

> For every nonempty set $X$, every relation $R$ entire on $X$, and every
> $a \in X$, there is a sequence $x : \mathbb{N} \to X$ ([[def-sequence]],
> [[def-natural-numbers]]) with
> $$x_0 = a \qquad \text{and} \qquad x_n \mathbin{R} x_{n+1} \ \text{ for every } n \in \mathbb{N}.$$

As everywhere in this library $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$, and the sequence is
indexed from $0$; the term $x_0$ is the prescribed starting point $a$ and every
later term is related to its predecessor.

**What DC adds to what came before.** [[def-choice-function]] and
[[def-axiom-of-choice]] select one element from each member of a family that is
fixed in advance, and [[def-countable-choice]] does the same for a family indexed
by $\mathbb{N}$. In both, the family is given before any selection is made. DC is
the principle needed when the $n$-th set to select from is not known until the
first $n$ selections have been made: here the admissible values of $x_{n+1}$ are
exactly the $R$-successors of $x_n$, so the family being chosen from is built
along the choosing. That is precisely the situation $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ does not
cover, and it is why a construction "pick $x_{n+1}$ depending on $x_n$, for every
$n$ at once" is not licensed by countable choice.

**The starting point may be dropped.** The formally weaker statement obtained by
deleting the clause $x_0 = a$ — for every nonempty $X$ and every entire $R$ there
is a sequence with $x_n \mathbin{R} x_{n+1}$ for all $n$ — is an immediate
consequence of the form above, since $X$ is nonempty and any of its elements may
be taken as $a$. The reverse derivation is standard and is not needed anywhere in
this library, so it is not carried out; every use below prescribes $x_0$.

**$R$ need not be an order and the terms need not be distinct.** What DC delivers
is a sequence, that is a function $\mathbb{N} \to X$, not a chain in the
order-theoretic sense ([[def-chain]]). The relation may be symmetric, and the
sequence may repeat a value or be constant; all that is asserted is
$x_n \mathbin{R} x_{n+1}$ at every index.

## Remarks

**Where DC sits among the choice principles.** It is a standard fact, proved in
the references and **not** in this library, that

$$\mathrm{AC} \;\Longrightarrow\; \mathrm{DC} \;\Longrightarrow\; \mathrm{AC}_\omega ,$$

and that neither implication reverses. The non-reversals are relative-consistency
results: what they establish is that ZF, if consistent, does not prove the
missing implications, never that those implications are false. This library
contains neither forcing nor permutation models and proves no independence
result, so all of that is quoted from the references and used nowhere.

**Nothing in this library proves DC, and nothing assumes it silently.** Like
[[def-axiom-of-choice]] and [[def-countable-choice]], DC is a statement that may
be assumed or not. Every theorem whose proof uses it says so in its own
statement, and the accounting for the compactness page is collected in
[[rem-compactness-choice-ledger-metric]].

**An upper bound, never a lower one.** When a later item records that its proof
uses DC, the claim made is that the argument given here is carried out in
$\mathrm{ZF} + \mathrm{DC}$. No item claims that DC is *necessary* for the
statement proved, because establishing necessity means separating the statement
from ZF, and that is an independence result of exactly the kind this library does
not prove.

## Definition

A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ ([[def-topological-space]]) is
**Hausdorff** when any two distinct points are separated by disjoint open sets:
for all $x, y \in X$ with $x \ne y$ there are $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$ with

$$x \in U, \qquad y \in V, \qquad U \cap V = \varnothing .$$

Since an open set containing a point is an open neighbourhood of it
([[def-neighbourhood-top]]), the condition reads: distinct points have disjoint
open neighbourhoods. Nothing is asserted about points that are equal, and the
condition is vacuous for a space with at most one point, so every such space is
Hausdorff.

**Every metrizable space is Hausdorff.** This is not proved here, because it is
already discharged: [[def-metrizable-space]] records it among the two things
every metrizable space has, deriving it from
[[thm-metric-hausdorff-separation]], which separates $p \ne q$ in a metric space
by the disjoint open balls $B(p,r)$ and $B(q,r)$ with $r = d(p,q)/2 > 0$. In
particular $\mathbb{R}$ with its usual topology, every $\mathbb{R}^n$, and every
subspace of a metrizable space are Hausdorff.

**Not every space is Hausdorff.** The indiscrete topology
$\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{ind}} = \{\varnothing, X\}$ on a set $X = \{a,b\}$ with
$a \ne b$ ([[def-standard-topologies]]) is not: the only open set containing $a$
is $X$, the only one containing $b$ is $X$, and $X \cap X = X \ne \varnothing$.
This is the same two-point space that [[def-metrizable-space]] uses to exhibit a
topology induced by no metric, and the reason is the same one: failure of the
Hausdorff condition is an obstruction to metrizability.

**Being Hausdorff is a topological property** ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]).
If $h : X \to Z$ is a homeomorphism and $X$ is Hausdorff, then for $z \ne z'$ in
$Z$ the points $h^{-1}(z)$ and $h^{-1}(z')$ are distinct, so they have disjoint
open $U, V$; the images $h[U]$ and $h[V]$ are open, disjoint, and contain $z$ and
$z'$ respectively, a homeomorphism carrying the open sets of one space
bijectively onto those of the other. So no space homeomorphic to a Hausdorff
space fails the condition.

**Scope of this item.** Only the definition, the metrizable case and the
two-point failure are recorded here, because that is all this page uses. The
Hausdorff condition is one of a graded family of separation axioms; that family,
its ordering, and the questions of which of its members are hereditary or
preserved by products, are not available at this point in the reading order and
nothing here anticipates them. What this page does use is a single negative
result: a quotient of a Hausdorff space need not be Hausdorff, which is recorded
below as a false statement and witnessed on the companion page.

## Remarks

- **Hausdorff spaces have closed singletons.** Fix $x \in X$ and take the union
  of all open subsets of $X$ that avoid $x$. Every $y \ne x$ belongs to one of
  them, by Hausdorff separation of $x$ and $y$, while $x$ belongs to none. The
  union is therefore exactly $X \setminus \{x\}$, so $\{x\}$ is closed.
  Thus the Hausdorff property implies the singleton-closed ($T_1$) property.
  The converse fails: closed singletons need not give disjoint neighbourhoods
  of distinct points.

- **What the Hausdorff condition buys, in the one place this page needs it.**
  Separation of distinct points by disjoint open sets is exactly what a quotient
  map can destroy: identifying points of a Hausdorff space can leave two classes
  every pair of whose open neighbourhoods meet, and the companion page exhibits
  such a quotient of a metrizable space. Nothing weaker than an explicit witness
  settles that, since the condition is a statement about all pairs of open sets.

- **The name.** Hausdorff's own 1914 axiom system for a topological space
  included this condition, so "topological space" once meant what is now called a
  Hausdorff space; this library follows the modern convention in which
  [[def-topological-space]] assumes no separation at all and every separation
  hypothesis is stated where it is used.

## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]).

- $X$ is **$T_0$**, or a **Kolmogorov space**, when any two distinct points are
  *topologically distinguishable*: for all $x, y \in X$ with $x \ne y$ there is
  an open set containing exactly one of $x$ and $y$.
- $X$ is **$T_1$**, or a **Frechet space**, when each of any two distinct points
  has an open set containing it and missing the other: for all $x, y \in X$ with
  $x \ne y$ there are $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$ with

$$x \in U, \quad y \notin U, \qquad y \in V, \quad x \notin V .$$

Nothing is asserted about a pair of equal points, so a space with at most one
point satisfies both conditions vacuously.

Since an open set containing a point is an open neighbourhood of it
([[def-neighbourhood-top]]), both conditions may be read with "open
neighbourhood" in place of "open set"; and by the same equivalence recorded in
[[def-neighbourhood-top]] they may be read with arbitrary neighbourhoods, since
a neighbourhood of $x$ contains an open one and an open neighbourhood is a
neighbourhood.

**Every $T_1$ space is $T_0$, and this is discharged here** rather than left to
the reader, because it is the bottom arrow of the whole hierarchy on this page.
Let $x \ne y$ and take $U, V$ as in the $T_1$ condition. Then $U$ is an open set
containing $x$ and not $y$, so it contains exactly one of the two points, which
is the $T_0$ condition. Only the first half of the $T_1$ condition is used, so
the implication does not reverse formally, and it does not reverse in fact:
Sierpinski space is a witness, recorded on the companion page.

**The two conditions differ exactly in symmetry.** $T_0$ asks for *one* open set
that tells the pair apart, with no control over which of the two it contains;
$T_1$ asks for *both* separations at once. In Sierpinski space
$(\{a,b\}, \{\varnothing, \{b\}, \{a,b\}\})$ of [[def-standard-topologies]] the
open set $\{b\}$ contains $b$ and not $a$, so the space is $T_0$; but the only
open set containing $a$ is the whole space, which also contains $b$, so it is
not $T_1$.

**Neither condition is a property of a set alone.** Both are properties of the
pair $(X, \mathcal{T})$, and both are inherited upwards along the comparison
order of [[def-topological-space]]: if $\mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2$
and $(X,\mathcal{T}_1)$ is $T_0$, respectively $T_1$, then so is
$(X,\mathcal{T}_2)$, since the separating open sets of the coarser topology lie
in the finer one. In particular the discrete topology satisfies both, and the
indiscrete topology on a set with at least two points satisfies neither.

## Remarks

- **The names.** The numbering $T_0, T_1, T_2, \dots$ is Alexandroff and Hopf's
  *Trennungsaxiome*; the individual names honour Kolmogorov and Frechet. This
  page fixes each axiom by its condition and treats the numeral as an
  abbreviation, because the numerals above $T_3$ are used inconsistently in the
  literature ([[rem-separation-axiom-conventions]]).

- **What $T_1$ says about closures.** $T_1$ is equivalent to the closedness of
  every singleton, and hence to $\overline{\{x\}} = \{x\}$ for every point
  ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]); that equivalence is the next item and
  is a theorem, not a restatement. The corresponding characterisation of $T_0$,
  that distinct points have distinct closures, is not needed on this page and is
  not proved here.

- **No separation is built into the word *space*.** [[def-topological-space]]
  assumes none; every separation property on this page is a hypothesis written
  out where it is used.

## Statement

Let $X$ be a compact ([[def-compact-space]]) Hausdorff
([[def-hausdorff-space]]) topological space. Then:

1. $X$ is **regular** ([[def-regular-and-t3-spaces]]);
2. $X$ is **normal** ([[def-normal-and-t4-spaces]]);
3. $X$ is $T_1$ ([[def-t0-and-t1-spaces]]), and hence $X$ is $T_3$ and $T_4$.

Following [[def-regular-and-t3-spaces]] and [[def-normal-and-t4-spaces]],
*regular* and *normal* name the separation conditions alone and the numerals
$T_3$ and $T_4$ name their conjunctions with $T_1$; claim 3 is what supplies the
$T_1$ half, and it is stated separately for that reason.

**Nothing stronger is claimed.** In particular it is not asserted here that a
compact Hausdorff space is completely regular
([[def-regular-and-t3-spaces]] distinguishes the two conditions), and no
continuous real-valued function is produced anywhere below.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A compact Hausdorff topological space $X$.

[A1] $X$ is regular when for every closed $C \subseteq X$ and every $x \in X \setminus C$ there are disjoint open $U \ni x$ and $V \supseteq C$; the case $C = \varnothing$ is met by $U = X$ and $V = \varnothing$, and $T_3$ is regular together with $T_1$ ([[def-regular-and-t3-spaces]], [[def-t0-and-t1-spaces]]).

[A2] $X$ is normal when for all disjoint closed $A, B \subseteq X$ there are disjoint open $U \supseteq A$ and $V \supseteq B$; the cases $A = \varnothing$ and $B = \varnothing$ are met by $\varnothing$ together with $X$, and $T_4$ is normal together with $T_1$ ([[def-normal-and-t4-spaces]], [[def-t0-and-t1-spaces]]).

[A3] $X$ is a topological space, so a subset is closed exactly when its complement is open ([[def-topological-space]]).

[L1] A closed subspace of a compact space is compact ([[thm-closed-subspace-of-a-compact-space-is-compact]], [[def-compact-space]]).

[L2] In a Hausdorff space, a point and a disjoint compact set have disjoint open neighbourhoods, and two disjoint compact sets have disjoint open neighbourhoods ([[thm-compact-subset-of-a-hausdorff-space-is-closed]], [[def-hausdorff-space]], [[def-compact-space]]).

[L3] Every Hausdorff space is $T_1$ ([[lem-urysohn-sits-between-hausdorff-and-regular-plus-t1]], claim 2, [[def-t0-and-t1-spaces]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $C \subseteq X$ be closed and let $x \in X \setminus C$; since $X$ is compact and $C$ is closed in $X$, the subspace $C$ is compact, and $x$ does not lie in it. [A3, L1]

1.2 Let $A, B \subseteq X$ be closed with $A \cap B = \varnothing$; since $X$ is compact and both are closed in $X$, both subspaces $A$ and $B$ are compact. [A3, L1]

1.3 $X$ is $T_1$, being Hausdorff. [L3]

2.1 By [L2], applied to the point $x$ and the disjoint compact set $C$ of step 1.1, there are disjoint open $U \ni x$ and $V \supseteq C$; as $C$ and $x$ were arbitrary this is exactly the condition of [A1], so $X$ is regular, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, A1, L2]

2.2 By [L2], applied to the two disjoint compact sets $A$ and $B$ of step 1.2, there are disjoint open $U \supseteq A$ and $V \supseteq B$; as $A$ and $B$ were arbitrary this is the condition of [A2], so $X$ is normal, which is claim 2. [step 1.2, A2, L2]

3.1 By step 1.3 the space is $T_1$; with step 2.1 it is regular and $T_1$, hence $T_3$, and with step 2.2 it is normal and $T_1$, hence $T_4$. This is claim 3. [step 1.3, step 2.1, step 2.2, A1, A2]

4.1 Steps 2.1, 2.2 and 3.1 are claims 1, 2 and 3, so a compact Hausdorff space is regular, normal, $T_3$ and $T_4$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The whole content is that "closed" and "compact" coincide here, in the direction that is needed.** Regularity asks a point to be separated from a closed set and normality asks two closed sets to be separated; compactness of the ambient space converts each closed set into a compact one, and the separation of compact sets in a Hausdorff space is what [[thm-compact-subset-of-a-hausdorff-space-is-closed]] supplies. No new separation argument is run.

- **Why compactness of $X$ is needed and not just of the sets separated.** The hypothesis is used only through [L1], to know that an arbitrary closed subset of $X$ is compact. A Hausdorff space in which the sets to be separated happen to be compact is separated by [L2] alone and needs no hypothesis on the ambient space at all; what compactness of $X$ buys is that *every* closed set is such a set.

- **The degenerate cases are not a gap.** If $C$, $A$ or $B$ is empty the required open sets are named outright in [A1] and [A2], so the argument does not depend on any nonemptiness hidden in the compact-separation clauses.

## Statement

**Assume the Axiom of Dependent Choice** ([[def-dependent-choice]]). Let
$(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space.

1. If $X$ is normal ([[def-normal-and-t4-spaces]]) and $A, B \subseteq X$ are
   disjoint closed sets, there is a continuous $f : X \to [0,1]$
   ([[def-continuous-map-top]], [[def-interval]]) with
   $A \subseteq f^{-1}(\{0\})$ and $B \subseteq f^{-1}(\{1\})$.
2. Conversely, if every pair of disjoint closed subsets of $X$ admits a
   continuous function into $[0,1]$ separating them in the sense of clause 1,
   then $X$ is normal. **This direction uses no choice principle.**

**Where the choice principle of clause 1 is spent, and why not less.** The
construction below builds, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, an assignment of an
open set to every dyadic rational of level $n$, extending the level-$(n-1)$
assignment; at each single level the finitely many new open sets are chosen at
once by [[lem-finite-choice]], a theorem of ZF, but stringing together
infinitely many such levels, each depending on the one before, is exactly the
situation dependent choice is for. The published
[[rem-urysohn-lemma-not-a-zf-theorem]] records, with its sources, that
$\mathrm{ZF}$ and even $\mathrm{ZF}$ together with the Axiom of Countable
Choice do not suffice, and that dependent choice does; nothing here claims
dependent choice is *necessary* for clause 1, only that the construction given
is carried out in $\mathrm{ZF} + \mathrm{DC}$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A topological space $(X,\mathcal{T})$ and dependent choice.

[A1] $\mathrm{DC}$: for every nonempty set $P$, every relation $R \subseteq P \times P$ entire on $P$ (every $p \in P$ has some $q \in P$ with $p \mathbin{R} q$), and every $a \in P$, there is a sequence $(p_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ with $p_0 = a$ and $p_k \mathbin{R} p_{k+1}$ for every $k$ ([[def-dependent-choice]]).

[L1] Shrinking: if $X$ is normal, $C \subseteq X$ is closed and $O \subseteq X$ is open with $C \subseteq O$, then there is open $W$ with $C \subseteq W \subseteq \overline{W} \subseteq O$ ([[lem-normality-via-shrinking]]).

[L2] Finite choice: a function $F$ with domain a natural number $n$, all of whose values are nonempty sets, admits a choice function for the family $F[n]$ of its values ([[lem-finite-choice]], [[def-choice-function]]), a theorem of ZF.

[L3] The dyadic rationals $D = \bigcup_{n} D_n$ of $[0,1]$ are an increasing union of finite levels; for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $D_{n+1} = D_n \cup \{\, t_j : 0 \le j < 2^n \,\}$, where $t_j$ is strictly between the $D_n$-consecutive pair $r_j := j/2^n$ and $s_j := (j+1)/2^n$, the $2^n$ points $t_j$ are pairwise distinct and disjoint from $D_n$, and every two elements of $D$ lie together in some common $D_n$ ([[def-the-dyadic-rationals-of-the-unit-interval]]).

[L4] Chaining: if $V_0, \dots, V_k$ ($k \ge 0$) are subsets of $X$ with $\overline{V_i} \subseteq V_{i+1}$ for every $i < k$, then $\overline{V_0} \subseteq V_k$, since $V_i \subseteq \overline{V_i} \subseteq V_{i+1}$ for each $i$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]) makes $\overline{V_0} \subseteq V_1 \subseteq V_2 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq V_k$ a chain of inclusions.

[L5] The generic construction: if $(U_r)_{r \in D}$ is a family of open subsets of $X$ with $\overline{U_r} \subseteq U_s$ whenever $r<s$ in $D$ and $U_1 = X$, then $g(x) := \inf(\{r \in D : x \in U_r\} \cup \{1\})$ is a continuous map $X \to [0,1]$ ([[lem-a-dyadic-scale-of-open-sets-defines-a-continuous-function]]).

[L6] The order rays $(-\infty,\tfrac12)$ and $(\tfrac12,\infty)$ are open in the usual topology of $\mathbb R$ ([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]], clause 3), so their traces $[0,\tfrac12)$ and $(\tfrac12,1]$ are open in the subspace topology of $[0,1]$ ([[def-subspace-topology-top]], [[def-interval]]). They are disjoint and contain $0$ and $1$, respectively.

[L7] Preimages of open sets under a continuous map are open ([[thm-continuity-characterisations-top]], clause (b), [[def-continuous-map-top]]).

[L8] $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ for every $A \subseteq X$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 Assume $X$ is normal and $A, B \subseteq X$ are disjoint closed sets (the hypothesis of clause 1). [assume-hyp]

1.2 Assume instead that every pair of disjoint closed subsets of $X$ admits a continuous function into $[0,1]$ separating them as in clause 1 (the hypothesis of clause 2). [assume-hyp]

2.1 Under step 1.1: $A \subseteq X \setminus B$, since $A \cap B = \varnothing$, and $X \setminus B$ is open since $B$ is closed; by [L1] applied to the closed set $A$ and the open set $X \setminus B$, fix open $\Phi_0(0)$ with $A \subseteq \Phi_0(0) \subseteq \overline{\Phi_0(0)} \subseteq X \setminus B$, and put $\Phi_0(1) := X \setminus B$, defining $\Phi_0 : D_0 \to \mathcal{T}$ on $D_0 = \{0,1\}$. [step 1.1, L1, choose, construct]

2.2 Under step 1.2: let $C, E \subseteq X$ be disjoint closed sets; fix a continuous $h : X \to [0,1]$ with $C \subseteq h^{-1}(\{0\})$ and $E \subseteq h^{-1}(\{1\})$. [step 1.2, choose]

3.1 Under step 1.1: $A \subseteq \Phi_0(0)$; $\overline{\Phi_0(0)} \subseteq \Phi_0(1)$; and $\Phi_0(1) = X \setminus B$. [step 2.1]

3.2 Under step 1.2, continuing: by [L6], $[0,\tfrac12)$ and $(\tfrac12,1]$ are open in $[0,1]$, disjoint, with $0 \in [0,\tfrac12)$ and $1 \in (\tfrac12,1]$; put $O_1 := h^{-1}(\,[0,\tfrac12)\,)$ and $O_2 := h^{-1}(\,(\tfrac12,1]\,)$, open in $X$ by [L7]. [step 2.2, L6, L7]

4.1 Under step 1.1: for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, call $\Phi : D_n \to \mathcal{T}$ **admissible at level $n$** when (i) $\overline{\Phi(r)} \subseteq \Phi(s)$ for every $r < s$ in $D_n$; (ii) $A \subseteq \Phi(0)$; (iii) $\Phi(1) = X \setminus B$. Put $P := \{\, (n,\Phi) : n \in \mathbb{N},\ \Phi \text{ admissible at level } n \,\}$, and for $(n,\Phi), (n',\Phi') \in P$ say $(n,\Phi) \mathbin{R} (n',\Phi')$ when $n' = n+1$ and $\Phi'|_{D_n} = \Phi$. By step 3.1, $(0,\Phi_0) \in P$. [step 3.1, construct]

4.2 Under step 1.2: $C \subseteq O_1$, since $h \equiv 0 \in [0,\tfrac12)$ on $C$; $E \subseteq O_2$, since $h \equiv 1 \in (\tfrac12,1]$ on $E$; and $O_1 \cap O_2 = h^{-1}\big(\,[0,\tfrac12) \cap (\tfrac12,1]\,\big) = h^{-1}(\varnothing) = \varnothing$. [step 2.2, step 3.2, L6]

5.1 Under step 1.1: let $(n,\Phi) \in P$. For each $j$ with $0 \le j < 2^n$, with $r_j, s_j, t_j$ as in [L3]: since $r_j < s_j$ in $D_n$, admissibility (i) gives $\overline{\Phi(r_j)} \subseteq \Phi(s_j)$, so by [L1] the set of open $W$ with $\overline{\Phi(r_j)} \subseteq W \subseteq \overline{W} \subseteq \Phi(s_j)$ is nonempty. [step 4.1, L1, L3]

5.2 Under step 1.2: since $C, E$ were an arbitrary disjoint closed pair, step 4.2 exhibits disjoint open supersets for every such pair, so $X$ is normal by [[def-normal-and-t4-spaces]]; this is clause 2, and no step of it used [A1]. [step 4.2]

6.1 Under step 1.1, continuing under step 5.1: by [L2] applied to the function assigning, to each $j < 2^n$, the nonempty set of open $W$ with $\overline{\Phi(r_j)} \subseteq W \subseteq \overline{W} \subseteq \Phi(s_j)$, fix a simultaneous choice, giving open $W_j$ with $\overline{\Phi(r_j)} \subseteq W_j \subseteq \overline{W_j} \subseteq \Phi(s_j)$ for every $0 \le j < 2^n$. [step 5.1, L2, choose]

7.1 Under step 1.1: define $\Phi' : D_{n+1} \to \mathcal{T}$ by $\Phi'|_{D_n} := \Phi$ and $\Phi'(t_j) := W_j$ for $0 \le j < 2^n$; this is well defined since $D_{n+1} = D_n \cup \{t_j : 0 \le j < 2^n\}$ with the $t_j$ pairwise distinct and disjoint from $D_n$ by [L3]. Then $(n,\Phi) \mathbin{R} (n+1,\Phi')$. [step 6.1, L3, construct]

8.1 Under step 1.1, with $\Phi, \Phi'$ as in step 7.1: for the $D_{n+1}$-consecutive pair $(r_j, t_j)$: $\overline{\Phi'(r_j)} = \overline{\Phi(r_j)} \subseteq W_j = \Phi'(t_j)$ by step 6.1; for the pair $(t_j, s_j)$: $\overline{\Phi'(t_j)} = \overline{W_j} \subseteq \Phi(s_j) = \Phi'(s_j)$ by step 6.1. [step 7.1, step 6.1]

9.1 Under step 1.1: for $x < y$ in $D_{n+1}$, the finitely many elements of $D_{n+1} \cap [x,y]$, listed increasingly as $x = u_0 < u_1 < \cdots < u_k = y$, are $D_{n+1}$-consecutive at each step $u_i < u_{i+1}$, and each such pair is one of the pairs of step 8.1 (every $D_{n+1}$-consecutive pair has at least one member among the new points $t_j$, since a new point was inserted into every $D_n$-consecutive gap); so $\overline{\Phi'(u_i)} \subseteq \Phi'(u_{i+1})$ at each step, and [L4] gives $\overline{\Phi'(x)} = \overline{\Phi'(u_0)} \subseteq \Phi'(u_k) = \Phi'(y)$. [step 8.1, L3, L4]

10.1 Under step 1.1: $A \subseteq \Phi'(0) = \Phi(0)$, since $0 \in D_n$ is unaffected by the extension; $\Phi'(1) = \Phi(1) = X \setminus B$, since $1 \in D_n$ is likewise unaffected; with step 9.1 this is admissibility of $\Phi'$ at level $n+1$, so $(n+1,\Phi') \in P$. [step 7.1, step 9.1, L3]

11.1 Under step 1.1: by steps 5.1, 6.1, 7.1 and 10.1, every $(n,\Phi) \in P$ has some $(n+1,\Phi') \in P$ with $(n,\Phi) \mathbin{R} (n+1,\Phi')$; so $R$ is entire on $P$. [step 7.1, step 10.1]

12.1 Under step 1.1: $P$ is nonempty by step 4.1 and $R$ is entire on $P$ by step 11.1; by [A1] applied with $a := (0,\Phi_0)$, there is a sequence $\big((m_k,\Psi_k)\big)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ with $(m_0,\Psi_0) = (0,\Phi_0)$ and $(m_k,\Psi_k) \mathbin{R} (m_{k+1},\Psi_{k+1})$ for every $k$. [step 4.1, step 11.1, A1, construct]

13.1 Under step 1.1: since $(n,\Phi) \mathbin{R} (n',\Phi')$ forces $n' = n+1$, and $m_0 = 0$, induction on $k$ gives $m_k = k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$; so each $\Psi_k : D_k \to \mathcal{T}$ is admissible at level $k$, and $\Psi_{k+1}|_{D_k} = \Psi_k$ for every $k$. [step 12.1]

14.1 Under step 1.1: for $r \in D$, fix $n$ with $r \in D_n$ [L3] and define $V_r := \Psi_n(r)$; by step 13.1, for $n \le n'$ with $r \in D_n$, $\Psi_{n'}(r) = \Psi_n(r)$ (chaining $\Psi_{n'}|_{D_n} = \Psi_n$ through the intermediate levels), so $V_r$ does not depend on the level $n$ chosen. [step 13.1, L3, construct]

15.1 Under step 1.1: for $r < s$ in $D$, fix $n$ with $r, s \in D_n$ [L3]; then $\overline{V_r} = \overline{\Psi_n(r)} \subseteq \Psi_n(s) = V_s$ by admissibility (i) of $\Psi_n$. Also $A \subseteq V_0$ and $V_1 = X \setminus B$, by admissibility (ii) and (iii) of $\Psi_n$ for any $n$. [step 14.1, step 13.1, L3]

16.1 Under step 1.1: define $U_r := V_r$ for $r \in D$ with $r < 1$, and $U_1 := X$. For $r < s$ in $D$: if $s < 1$, $\overline{U_r} = \overline{V_r} \subseteq V_s = U_s$ by step 15.1; if $s = 1$, $\overline{U_r} = \overline{V_r} \subseteq V_1 = X \setminus B \subseteq X = U_1$ by step 15.1. So $\overline{U_r} \subseteq U_s$ whenever $r < s$ in $D$, and $U_1 = X$. [step 15.1, construct]

17.1 Under step 1.1: by [L5] applied to $(U_r)_{r \in D}$ of step 16.1, $f(x) := \inf(\{r \in D : x \in U_r\} \cup \{1\})$ is a continuous map $X \to [0,1]$. [step 16.1, L5]

17.2 Under step 1.1: for $b \in B$ and $r \in D$ with $r < 1$: fix $n$ with $r \in D_n$ [L3]; since $1 \in D_n$ also, admissibility (i) of $\Psi_n$ applied to $r < 1$ gives $\overline{\Psi_n(r)} \subseteq \Psi_n(1) = X \setminus B$, that is $\overline{V_r} \subseteq X \setminus B$; since $V_r \subseteq \overline{V_r}$ by [L8] and $U_r = V_r$ by step 16.1, $U_r \cap B = \varnothing$, so $b \notin U_r$. [step 14.1, step 13.1, step 16.1, L3, L8]

18.1 Under step 1.1: for $a \in A$: $a \in V_0$ by step 15.1, and $U_0 = V_0$ by step 16.1 (as $0 < 1$), so $a \in U_0$ and $0 \in \{r \in D : a \in U_r\}$; hence $f(a) \le 0$, and $f(a) \ge 0$ since $f$ maps into $[0,1]$ by step 17.1, so $f(a) = 0$. [step 17.1, step 16.1, step 15.1]

18.2 Under step 1.1: for $b \in B$: by step 17.2, $b \notin U_r$ for every $r \in D$ with $r < 1$, and $b \in U_1 = X$ by step 16.1; so $\{r \in D : b \in U_r\} \cup \{1\} = \{1\}$, giving $f(b) = \inf\{1\} = 1$. [step 17.2, step 16.1]

19.1 Steps 17.1, 18.1 and 18.2 show that, under the hypothesis of step 1.1, $f$ is a continuous map $X \to [0,1]$ with $A \subseteq f^{-1}(\{0\})$ and $B \subseteq f^{-1}(\{1\})$, which is clause 1. [step 17.1, step 18.1, step 18.2]

20.1 Steps 19.1 and 5.2 establish clauses 1 and 2 respectively. [step 19.1, step 5.2, discharge-construct] ∎

## Remarks

- **The lemma is stated for a normal space, not a $T_4$ space.** $T_1$ is used nowhere above; it is needed only to turn a *point* into a closed set, which is the extra step the next corollary spends. The published [[rem-urysohn-lemma-not-a-zf-theorem]] states the classical $T_4$ form; the form proved here is the more general one, and the two are not in tension — the $T_4$ form follows by adding the $T_1$ hypothesis, which is not used in this proof at all.

- **Only clause 1 costs a choice principle**, and it is spent at exactly one place: the single application of dependent choice in step 12.1, which strings together the countably many admissible levels built one finite step at a time in steps 5.1–10.1. Every other existential instantiation above (steps 2.1, 2.2 and 6.1) draws from a single nonempty set or, in step 6.1, from a finite family of them via [[lem-finite-choice]], and neither costs anything beyond ZF.

- **Why the construction tracks $X \setminus B$ rather than $X$ at $r=1$.** Recording $\Phi_n(1) := X \setminus B$ throughout the recursion, rather than $X$, is what makes admissibility clause (i) alone carry the whole $B$-avoidance property: since $1 \in D_n$ for every $n$, clause (i) applied to any $r<1$ already gives $\overline{\Phi_n(r)} \subseteq \Phi_n(1) = X \setminus B$, with no separate bookkeeping. Only at the very end, in step 16.1, is the top value widened from $X \setminus B$ to $X$, which is exactly what [[lem-a-dyadic-scale-of-open-sets-defines-a-continuous-function]] requires.
