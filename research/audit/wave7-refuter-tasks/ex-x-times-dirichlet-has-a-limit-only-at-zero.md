## Example

With $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ as in [[cex-dirichlet-has-no-limit-anywhere]], let

$$d : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad d(x) := x \cdot \mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(x),$$

so $d(x) = x$ for rational $x$ and $d(x) = 0$ for irrational $x$. Then the limit
of $d$ at $0$ exists, with

$$\lim_{x \to 0} d(x) = 0 ,$$

and at **every** $c \ne 0$ the function $d$ has no limit.

**The point of the example.** The factor $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ has a limit
nowhere; multiplying it by $x$ repairs exactly one point, and only that one. The
repair at $0$ is the squeeze theorem
([[thm-squeeze-for-function-limits]]) applied to
$-|x| \le d(x) \le |x|$; the failure elsewhere is the same two-sequence argument
as in [[cex-dirichlet-has-no-limit-anywhere]], now with image limits $c$ and $0$,
which are distinct precisely because $c \ne 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The canonical copy $\mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ of the rationals, the irrationals $X = \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$, the function $d(x) = x \cdot \mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(x)$, and a real $c \ne 0$.

[L1] The values of $d$: $d(x) = x$ for $x \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $d(x) = 0$ for $x \in X$; every real lies in exactly one of $\mathbb{Q}$ and $X$ ([[cex-dirichlet-has-no-limit-anywhere]]).

[L2] The limit condition ([[def-function-limit]]): $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = P$ means that for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x$ in the domain with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|f(x) - P| < \varepsilon$.

[L3] Squeeze theorem: if $f \le g \le k$ on $A \cap N^{*}_{\eta}(c)$ for some real $\eta > 0$ and the limits of $f$ and of $k$ at $c$ exist and are equal to $L$, then the limit of $g$ at $c$ exists and equals $L$ ([[thm-squeeze-for-function-limits]]).

[L4] Nonexistence criterion ([[cor-sequential-criterion-for-nonexistence]]).

[L5] For every real $c$ there are a sequence $(q_k)$ with all terms in $\mathbb{Q} \setminus \{c\}$ and a sequence $(u_k)$ with all terms in $X \setminus \{c\}$, both converging to $c$. This is exactly what is established in the course of [[cex-dirichlet-has-no-limit-anywhere]], from density ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) and the sequential characterisation of the closure ([[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]], [[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]); the countable choice spent there is inherited here.

[L6] Every real is a limit point of $\mathbb{R}$, punctured neighbourhoods being never empty ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L7] Absolute value: $|u| \ge 0$; $-|u| \le u \le |u|$; $|u| = u$ for $u \ge 0$; $|0| = 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]). Order arithmetic: trichotomy and totality; $0 < 1$, so $2 > 0$ and $\varepsilon/2 < \varepsilon$ for $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L8] A constant sequence converges to its value ([[def-real-limit]], [[def-sequence]]).

## Verification

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For every $x \in \mathbb{R}$, $-|x| \le d(x) \le |x|$: if $x \in \mathbb{Q}$ then $d(x) = x$ and $-|x| \le x \le |x|$; if $x \in X$ then $d(x) = 0$ and $-|x| \le 0 \le |x|$. [L1, L7]

1.2 Every real is a limit point of $\mathbb{R}$; in particular $0$ and the given $c$ are. [L6]

1.3 The functions $x \mapsto -|x|$ and $x \mapsto |x|$ have limit $0$ at $0$: given a real $\varepsilon > 0$ take $\delta := \varepsilon$; every $x$ with $0 < |x - 0| < \delta$ satisfies $\bigl| |x| - 0 \bigr| = |x| < \varepsilon$ and $\bigl| -|x| - 0 \bigr| = |x| < \varepsilon$. [L2, L7]

2.1 The three functions satisfy $-|x| \le d(x) \le |x|$ on all of $\mathbb{R}$, in particular on $\mathbb{R} \cap N^{*}_{1}(0)$, and the outer two have limit $0$ at $0$; since $0$ is a limit point of $\mathbb{R}$, the squeeze theorem [L3] gives that the limit of $d$ at $0$ exists and equals $0$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, L3]

2.2 Fix the real $c \ne 0$. By [L5] there are a sequence $(q_k)$ with all terms in $\mathbb{Q} \setminus \{c\}$ and a sequence $(u_k)$ with all terms in $X \setminus \{c\}$, both converging to $c$. [step 1.2, L5, choose]

3.1 By [L1], $d(q_k) = q_k$ for every $k$, so the image sequence $(d(q_k))$ is $(q_k)$ itself and converges to $c$; and $d(u_k) = 0$ for every $k$, so that image sequence is constant and converges to $0$. Since $c \ne 0$, the two limits are distinct, and both sequences have all their terms in $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{c\}$ and converge to $c$; by [L4] the function $d$ has no limit at $c$. [step 2.2, L1, L4, L7, L8]

4.1 So the limit of $d$ exists at $0$, with value $0$, and fails to exist at every other real: $d$ has a limit at exactly one point. [step 2.1, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why $0$ is the exceptional point.** The squeeze bound $|d(x)| \le |x|$ is useful only where $|x|$ is small, that is near $0$; at any other $c$ the two bounding functions have limit $|c| \ne 0$ and $-|c|$, which are different, so the squeeze theorem says nothing there. That is not an accident of the proof: the two-sequence argument shows the limit genuinely fails at every such $c$.

- **The value $d(0) = 0$ happens to equal the limit**, since $0$ is rational, so $d$ satisfies at $0$ the equality that [[fs-limit-equals-value]] shows is not automatic. It is the only point of $\mathbb{R}$ at which $d$ does so.

- **Contrast with $\psi(1/x)$.** There the oscillation is bounded and the failure is confined to a single point, $0$, with the multiplication by $x$ repairing precisely that point ([[ex-x-times-psi-tends-to-zero]]). Here the failure is everywhere and the multiplication repairs precisely one point. The two examples are the same mechanism — a bounded factor damped by a vanishing one — applied to opposite kinds of irregularity.

Drop the requirement and the implication can be satisfied\n   vacuously by *every* real $L$ at once, which is exactly what\n   [[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]] records. At a point of $A$\n   that is not a limit point of $A$ — an isolated point — the symbol\n   $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x)$ is therefore **not defined** in this library.\n\n2. **$c \\in A$ is not required.** A limit point of $A$ need not belong to $A$\n   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and the definition never evaluates $f$ at $c$. This\n   is what allows a limit to be taken at a point where the function is not\n   defined at all, as at $0$ for $x \\mapsto x\\,\\psi(1/x)$.\n\n3. **The value $f(c)$, when it exists, is irrelevant.** The hypothesis\n   $0 < |x - c|$ excludes $x = c$ from the quantifier, so changing $f$ at the\n   single point $c$ changes nothing. Equality of the limit with the value is an\n   extra condition, not a consequence: [[fs-limit-equals-value]].\n\n**The notation presumes uniqueness.** Writing $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = L$ treats\nthe left-hand side as a name for a single real number, which is legitimate only\nbecause at a limit point at most one $L$ can satisfy the displayed condition.\nThat obligation is discharged by [[lem-function-limit-unique]], recorded in this\nitem's `justified_by`.

Restricting either\nquantifier to the positive rationals gives the same relation: every positive\nrational is a positive real, and below every positive real lies a positive\nrational ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), so an $\\varepsilon$-condition verified for\nall positive rationals is verified for an arbitrary positive real $\\eta$ by\nrunning it at a rational $\\varepsilon$ with $0 < \\varepsilon < \\eta$, and a\n$\\delta$ produced as a real may be shrunk to a rational one below it.

## Statement refuted

Write $\mathbb{Q}$ for the canonical copy of the rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$
([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), $X := \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$ for the
irrationals, and let

$$\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}} : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad \mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(x) := \begin{cases} 1 & x \in \mathbb{Q}, \\ 0 & x \in X. \end{cases}$$

**Refuted claim:** there is a point $c \in \mathbb{R}$ at which
$\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ has a limit ([[def-function-limit]]).

The refutation fixes an arbitrary real $c$ and produces two sequences tending to
$c$, one of rationals and one of irrationals, both avoiding $c$; the image
sequences are constantly $1$ and constantly $0$, and
[[cor-sequential-criterion-for-nonexistence]] applies. Since $c$ was arbitrary,
the function has a limit nowhere.

**Where the choice principle enters, and where it does not.** Producing the two
sequences is a use of [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]], whose
left-to-right direction spends countable choice, and that cost is inherited here
and recorded by that item. The criterion applied afterwards is the choice-free
one ([[cor-sequential-criterion-for-nonexistence]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The canonical copy $\mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ of the rationals, the irrationals $X = \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$, the function $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ above, and an arbitrary real $c$.

[L1] Density: $\mathbb{Q}$ and $X$ are both dense in $\mathbb{R}$, that is, each has closure $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]); and the closure of a set $S$ is exactly the set of points every neighbourhood of which meets $S$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L2] Sequential characterisation of the closure: $x$ lies in the closure of $S$ if and only if there is a sequence with all terms in $S$ converging to $x$ ([[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]], [[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]). The direction used below, from the closure to a sequence, is the one that spends countable choice, as that item records.

[L3] Neighbourhoods: $N_{\rho}(u) = \{\, y : |y - u| < \rho \,\}$ for real $\rho > 0$, so $N_{\varepsilon/2}(c + \varepsilon/2) = \{\, y : c < y < c + \varepsilon \,\}$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L4] Nonexistence criterion: if two sequences with all terms in $A \setminus \{c\}$ converge to $c$ while the image sequences converge to distinct reals, then the function has no limit at $c$ ([[cor-sequential-criterion-for-nonexistence]]).

[L5] Every real is a limit point of $\mathbb{R}$, punctured neighbourhoods being never empty ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L6] A constant sequence converges to its value ([[def-real-limit]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L7] Absolute value and order: $|u| \ge 0$ and $|u| = u$ for $u \ge 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]); $0 < 1$, so $2 > 0$, $\varepsilon/2 > 0$ and $\varepsilon/2 < \varepsilon$ for $\varepsilon > 0$; trichotomy and totality ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $c \in \mathbb{R}$ be arbitrary. Then $c$ is a limit point of $\mathbb{R}$, the domain of $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$, so the question of a limit at $c$ is well posed. [L5]

1.2 Let $S$ be either $\mathbb{Q}$ or $X$, and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real. Applying [L1] at the real $c + \varepsilon/2$ with the radius $\varepsilon/2 > 0$, the neighbourhood $N_{\varepsilon/2}(c + \varepsilon/2)$ meets $S$; and by [L3] every $y$ in that neighbourhood satisfies $c < y < c + \varepsilon$, hence $y \ne c$ and $0 < |y - c| < \varepsilon$. So every neighbourhood of $c$ meets $S \setminus \{c\}$. [L1, L3, L7]

2.1 By [L1] again, step 1.2 says exactly that $c$ lies in the closure of $\mathbb{Q} \setminus \{c\}$ and in the closure of $X \setminus \{c\}$. Hence [L2] supplies a sequence $(q_k)$ with all terms in $\mathbb{Q} \setminus \{c\}$ converging to $c$, and a sequence $(u_k)$ with all terms in $X \setminus \{c\}$ converging to $c$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, choose]

3.1 Every term of $(q_k)$ lies in $\mathbb{Q}$, so $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(q_k) = 1$ for every $k$ and the image sequence is the constant sequence $1$, converging to $1$; every term of $(u_k)$ lies in $X$, so $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(u_k) = 0$ for every $k$ and that image sequence converges to $0$. The reals $1$ and $0$ are distinct. [step 2.1, L6, L7]

4.1 Both sequences have all their terms in $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{c\}$ and converge to $c$, while their image sequences converge to distinct reals; by [L4] the function $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ has no limit at $c$. Since $c \in \mathbb{R}$ was arbitrary, it has a limit at no point of $\mathbb{R}$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 3.1, L4] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the sets are punctured before the sequences are drawn.** [[cor-sequential-criterion-for-nonexistence]] requires all terms to lie in $A \setminus \{c\}$, since a sequence allowed to take the value $c$ would report on $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(c)$, which the limit ignores ([[def-function-limit]]). Step 1.2 therefore verifies density of $\mathbb{Q} \setminus \{c\}$ and of $X \setminus \{c\}$ directly, by placing the auxiliary neighbourhood strictly to the right of $c$.

- **The two densities are not proved the same way.** $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense because it is built to approximate; $X$ is dense because a countable set cannot exhaust an interval. Both are claims 1 and 2 of [[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]], and this item uses them only through the neighbourhood formulation of [L1].

- **The failure is as total as possible.** Not merely does the limit fail at some points: it fails at every point of $\mathbb{R}$, while the function is bounded throughout, taking only the values $0$ and $1$. Multiplying by $x$ leaves exactly one point where a limit survives, which is [[ex-x-times-dirichlet-has-a-limit-only-at-zero]].

## Statement

In any ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, the multiplicative identity
satisfies $0 < 1$; that is, $1 \in P$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$ and multiplicative identity $1$ ([[def-field]]).

[L1] In any field $1 \neq 0$ ([[def-field]]).

[L2] For every $x \neq 0$ the square satisfies $x^2 > 0$ ([[lem-of-square-positive]]).

[L3] The identity axiom gives $1 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1^2$ ([[def-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By the field axioms $1 \neq 0$, and $1 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1^2$. [L1, L3]

2.1 Since $1 \neq 0$, applying the square lemma with $x = 1$ gives $1^2 > 0$. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 Because $1 = 1^2$, it follows that $1 > 0$, i.e. $0 < 1$. [step 2.1, step 1.1, L3] ∎

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c$ be a limit
point of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]). Then $f$ has **no** limit at $c$ — that
is, no $L \in \mathbb{R}$ satisfies $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$
([[def-function-limit]]) — as soon as either of the following occurs.

1. There are sequences $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ with all terms in $A \setminus \{c\}$,
   both converging to $c$, and reals $P \ne Q$ with $f(x_k) \to P$ and
   $f(y_k) \to Q$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]).
2. There is a sequence $(x_k)$ with all terms in $A \setminus \{c\}$, converging
   to $c$, for which $(f(x_k))$ does not converge.

**Only the choice-free half of the Heine criterion is used.** The proof runs the
implication from condition 1 to condition 2 of
[[thm-sequential-criterion-for-function-limits]], which is a theorem of ZF; no
sequence is constructed here, both being supplied by the hypothesis. So this
corollary, the workhorse for showing that a limit fails to exist, costs no
choice principle at all.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and a limit point $c$ of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-function-limit]]).

[L1] Heine criterion, the direction from the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ limit to sequences: if $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$ then $f(z_k) \to L$ for every sequence $(z_k)$ with all terms in $A \setminus \{c\}$ converging to $c$ ([[thm-sequential-criterion-for-function-limits]]). That direction is proved without any choice principle.

[L2] A sequence of reals has at most one limit, so two limits of the same sequence are equal, and a sequence with a limit converges ([[lem-limit-unique]], [[def-real-limit]], [[def-sequence]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contrapositive.

1.1 Each of the two claims has the form "hypothesis $\Rightarrow$ $f$ has no limit at $c$"; we prove the contrapositive of each, namely that if some $L \in \mathbb{R}$ satisfies $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$ then neither hypothesis can hold. [contrapositive-reduce]

1.2 Assume there is $L \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$. [assume-hyp]

2.1 Let $(z_k)$ be an arbitrary sequence with all terms in $A \setminus \{c\}$ converging to $c$. By [L1], $(f(z_k))$ converges, with limit $L$. [step 1.2, L1]

3.1 Under hypothesis 1 this applies to $(x_k)$ and to $(y_k)$: $f(x_k) \to P$ and $f(x_k) \to L$ give $P = L$ by [L2], and likewise $Q = L$, so $P = Q$; hypothesis 1, which asserts $P \ne Q$, therefore fails. [step 2.1, L2]

3.2 Under hypothesis 2 it applies to $(x_k)$ and gives that $(f(x_k))$ converges; hypothesis 2, which asserts that it does not, therefore fails. [step 2.1, L2]

4.1 So the existence of a limit of $f$ at $c$ excludes both hypotheses; contrapositively, either hypothesis excludes the existence of a limit of $f$ at $c$. [step 3.1, step 3.2, discharge-contrapositive] ∎

## Remarks

- **This is the standard way a limit is shown not to exist**, and the reason is that the direct route would have to refute a statement beginning "there exists $L$": one would have to argue about every real $L$ at once. Two sequences reduce that to a single computation, as on the companion page for $\psi(1/x)$ at $0$ and for the indicator of $\mathbb{Q}$ at every point.

- **The hypothesis "all terms in $A \setminus \{c\}$" is not decorative.** A sequence allowed to take the value $c$ carries information about $f(c)$, which [[def-function-limit]] deliberately ignores; the constant sequence $z_k = c$ would then refute every limit at once.

- **What the corollary does not say.** It gives a sufficient condition for the limit not to exist, not a necessary one in any weaker form: the converse statement, that a limit exists as soon as all such image sequences converge to one value, is the other direction of [[thm-sequential-criterion-for-function-limits]] and is exactly the direction that spends countable choice ([[rem-heine-criterion-choice-cost]]).

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) with its order and absolute value
([[def-real-order]]).

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$, let $c \in \mathbb{R}$
be a **limit point** of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and let $L \in \mathbb{R}$.
We say that **$f(x)$ tends to $L$ as $x$ tends to $c$**, and write

$$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L ,$$

when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ 0 < |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - L| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

where $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ range over the **positive reals**.

In the language of neighbourhoods ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]) the condition reads:
for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ with

$$f\bigl(A \cap N^{*}_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \;\subseteq\; N_{\varepsilon}(L),$$

$N^{*}_{\delta}(c) = \{\, y : 0 < |y - c| < \delta \,\}$ being the punctured
$\delta$-neighbourhood of $c$ and $N_{\varepsilon}(L) = (L - \varepsilon,\ L +
\varepsilon)$ the open interval of [[def-interval]]. The two forms agree because
$|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ says exactly $f(x) \in N_\varepsilon(L)$, and
$0 < |x - c| < \delta$ says exactly $x \in N^{*}_\delta(c)$.

**Three features of this definition are load bearing, not decoration.**

1. **$c$ is required to be a limit point of $A$.** By [[def-limit-point-r]] that
   says every punctured neighbourhood of $c$ meets $A$, so for every $\delta > 0$
   the set $A \cap N^{*}_\delta(c)$ over which the implication quantifies is
   nonempty. Drop the requirement and the implication can be satisfied
   vacuously by *every* real $L$ at once, which is exactly what
   [[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]] records. At a point of $A$
   that is not a limit point of $A$ — an isolated point — the symbol
   $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ is therefore **not defined** in this library.

2. **$c \in A$ is not required.** A limit point of $A$ need not belong to $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and the definition never evaluates $f$ at $c$. This
   is what allows a limit to be taken at a point where the function is not
   defined at all, as at $0$ for $x \mapsto x\,\psi(1/x)$.

3. **The value $f(c)$, when it exists, is irrelevant.** The hypothesis
   $0 < |x - c|$ excludes $x = c$ from the quantifier, so changing $f$ at the
   single point $c$ changes nothing. Equality of the limit with the value is an
   extra condition, not a consequence: [[fs-limit-equals-value]].

**The notation presumes uniqueness.** Writing $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$ treats
the left-hand side as a name for a single real number, which is legitimate only
because at a limit point at most one $L$ can satisfy the displayed condition.
That obligation is discharged by [[lem-function-limit-unique]], recorded in this
item's `justified_by`. As with $\sup S$ ([[rem-sup-conventions]]) and
$\lim_k x_k$ ([[lem-limit-unique]]), the symbol is written only for a function
already known to have a limit at $c$.

**Real and rational $\varepsilon$ define the same relation.** Above,
$\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ range over the positive reals. Restricting either
quantifier to the positive rationals gives the same relation: every positive
rational is a positive real, and below every positive real lies a positive
rational ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), so an $\varepsilon$-condition verified for
all positive rationals is verified for an arbitrary positive real $\eta$ by
running it at a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, and a
$\delta$ produced as a real may be shrunk to a rational one below it. This is
the passage sanctioned in the remarks of [[def-sequence]], and it is what lets
this definition be compared with [[def-real-limit]], whose $\varepsilon$ is
rational, in [[thm-sequential-criterion-for-function-limits]].

## Remarks

- **Terminology.** *Limit point* here is a property of the set $A$ and the point
  $c$, in the sense of [[def-limit-point-r]]; it has nothing to do with
  subsequential limits ([[def-subsequential-limit]]), and the distinction is the
  one that item records.

- **Why the punctured condition, and not $|x - c| < \delta$.** With the
  unpunctured condition the definition would force $f$ to be defined at $c$ and
  would force $|f(c) - L| < \varepsilon$ for every $\varepsilon$, that is,
  $L = f(c)$. The resulting notion is continuity at $c$, a strictly stronger
  condition, and conflating the two is the error catalogued in
  [[fs-limit-equals-value]].

- **One-sided and infinite variants.** Restricting the domain to one side of $c$
  gives the one-sided limits of [[def-one-sided-limits]]; replacing the
  conditions on $x$ or on $f(x)$ by unboundedness conditions gives the limits at
  and to infinity of [[def-limits-at-infinity]]. Both are built on this
  definition rather than beside it.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with open and closed sets as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

- The **interior** of $A$ is the union of all open subsets of $A$:
  $$A^{\circ} \;:=\; \bigcup \{\, U \subseteq \mathbb{R} : U \text{ open and } U \subseteq A \,\}.$$
- The **closure** of $A$ is the intersection of all closed supersets of $A$:
  $$\overline{A} \;:=\; \bigcap \{\, F \subseteq \mathbb{R} : F \text{ closed and } A \subseteq F \,\}.$$
- The **boundary** of $A$ is $\partial A := \overline{A} \setminus A^{\circ}$.
- The **exterior** of $A$ is $\operatorname{ext} A := (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)^{\circ}$.

**Both operators are well defined and deliver what their names claim.** The
family whose union defines $A^{\circ}$ always contains $\varnothing$, and the
family whose intersection defines $\overline{A}$ always contains $\mathbb{R}$,
so the second family is nonempty and both expressions denote subsets of
$\mathbb{R}$ without appeal to any convention about empty unions or
intersections. Moreover:

- $A^{\circ}$ is **open**, being a union of open sets
  ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], claim 1), and $A^{\circ} \subseteq A$, since
  every set in the family is a subset of $A$. It is therefore the **largest**
  open subset of $A$: any open $U \subseteq A$ is a member of the family and so
  $U \subseteq A^{\circ}$.
- $\overline{A}$ is **closed**, being an intersection of a nonempty family of
  closed sets ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], claim 3), and $A \subseteq
  \overline{A}$, since every set in the family contains $A$. It is therefore the
  **smallest** closed superset of $A$: any closed $F \supseteq A$ is a member of
  the family and so $\overline{A} \subseteq F$.

**Pointwise description of the interior.** For $x \in \mathbb{R}$,

$$x \in A^{\circ} \iff \text{there is } \varepsilon > 0 \text{ with } N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A .$$

If $x \in A^{\circ}$ then, $A^{\circ}$ being open and containing $x$, there is
$\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A^{\circ} \subseteq A$.
Conversely if $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A$ then $N_\varepsilon(x)$ is an open
subset of $A$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) containing $x$, hence
$x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A^{\circ}$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

The corresponding pointwise description of the closure is not a definitional
matter and is proved separately, as [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

## Remarks

- **The four sets partition nothing by themselves, but three of them do.** For
  every $A$ the three sets $A^{\circ}$, $\partial A$ and $\operatorname{ext} A$
  are pairwise disjoint with union $\mathbb{R}$. This is not proved here and is
  not used on this page; what is used is only the definitions above and the
  characterisations of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

- **Interior and closure are dual.** Complementation exchanges the two families
  above, since $U$ is open exactly when $\mathbb{R} \setminus U$ is closed, so
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus A^{\circ} = \overline{\mathbb{R} \setminus A}$ and
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A} = (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)^{\circ} =
  \operatorname{ext} A$. The second identity is the reason the exterior is
  usually described as "the complement of the closure".

- **$A$ is open exactly when $A = A^{\circ}$, and closed exactly when
  $A = \overline{A}$.** For the first: $A^{\circ} \subseteq A$ always, and
  $A \subseteq A^{\circ}$ holds exactly when $A$ is one of the open subsets of
  $A$, that is, exactly when $A$ is open. The closure half is the same argument
  read the other way, and it is recorded as a claim of
  [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] because the rest of that theorem needs it.

- **Boundary points may or may not belong to the set.** $\partial (0,1) =
  \partial [0,1] = \{0,1\}$, and the two boundary points lie outside the first
  set and inside the second; the boundary sees only the way the set meets its
  complement, not which side the edge is assigned to.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]] and closure as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]].

- $x$ is an **adherent point** of $A$ when $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne
  \varnothing$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$.
- $x$ is a **limit point** (or *accumulation point*) of $A$ when
  $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every real
  $\varepsilon > 0$: every punctured neighbourhood of $x$ meets $A$.
- $x$ is an **isolated point** of $A$ when $x \in A$ and there is a real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$.
- The **derived set** of $A$ is
  $$A' \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \text{ is a limit point of } A \,\}.$$
- $A$ is **dense in $\mathbb{R}$** when $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$.

**A limit point is an adherent point**, since $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq
N_\varepsilon(x)$; and an element of $A$ is an adherent point of $A$, since
$x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). So the adherent
points of $A$ are exactly the points of $A \cup A'$, a statement proved as part
of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

**Limit point and isolated point are exact opposites inside $A$.** For
$x \in A$: $x$ is an isolated point of $A$ exactly when it is not a limit point
of $A$. Indeed $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$ says precisely that
$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, because $x$ itself always lies in
$N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ when $x \in A$; so the existence of an $\varepsilon$
witnessing isolation is the negation of the condition defining a limit point.
A point of $A$ is therefore either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$, and
never both.

**A limit point need not belong to the set, and a point of the set need not be a
limit point.** Both possibilities occur, and the two examples that matter later
are $0$, which is a limit point of $\{\, 1/k : k \ge 1 \,\}$ without belonging
to it, and $0$ again, which belongs to $\{0\} \cup [1,2]$ as an isolated point.

## Remarks

- **Terminology: *limit point* here is about a set, never about a sequence.**
  This library reserves *subsequential limit* for the sequential notion
  ([[def-subsequential-limit]]), and the two are genuinely different: the
  constant sequence $x_k = 0$ has $0$ as a subsequential limit, while its set of
  values $\{0\}$ has no limit point at all. The distinction is the one
  [[def-subsequential-limit]] records under "Terminology", and it is respected
  throughout this page.

- **Density is defined through the closure, not through intervals.** Saying
  $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$ is equivalent to saying that every nonempty open
  subset of $\mathbb{R}$ meets $A$, and also to saying that every neighbourhood
  of every real meets $A$; the equivalences follow from
  [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] and are used in that form in
  [[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]].

- **The derived set need not be comparable with the set.** It can be strictly
  larger, as for $\mathbb{Q}$: every punctured neighbourhood of any real
  contains a rational, since density supplies one strictly between $x$ and
  $x + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]), so the derived set of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is all of $\mathbb{R}$. It can be strictly smaller, as for
  $\{0\}$, whose derived set is empty; and it can be neither, as for
  $\{0\} \cup (1,2)$, whose derived set is $[1,2]$, a set containing points
  outside the original and omitting the point $0$ of it. A closed set satisfying
  $A \subseteq A'$ is called perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]).

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]) and its absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]).

Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ with
$\varepsilon > 0$. The **$\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\},$$

and the **punctured $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \;=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}.$$

The two descriptions of $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ agree because $|y - x| = 0$ holds
exactly when $y = x$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**A neighbourhood is an open interval.** For every $x$ and every
$\varepsilon > 0$,

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;=\; (x - \varepsilon,\ x + \varepsilon),$$

the interval of [[def-interval]]. Indeed [[lem-of-abs-value]] gives, for
$\varepsilon > 0$, the equivalence $|y - x| < \varepsilon \iff -\varepsilon <
y - x < \varepsilon$, and adding $x$ throughout turns the right-hand side into
$x - \varepsilon < y < x + \varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**The centre lies in its own neighbourhoods.** $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, since
$|x - x| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**Punctured neighbourhoods are never empty.** The element
$y := x + \varepsilon/2$ satisfies $|y - x| = \varepsilon/2$, which is
$> 0$ and $< \varepsilon$, so $y \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$
([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

**Monotonicity in the radius.** If $0 < \delta \le \varepsilon$ then
$N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, because $|y - x| < \delta \le
\varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**Nesting at an interior point.** If $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and
$0 < \delta \le \varepsilon - |y - x|$, then

$$N_\delta(y) \;\subseteq\; N_\varepsilon(x).$$

Indeed for $z \in N_\delta(y)$ the triangle inequality
([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]) gives
$|z - x| = |(z - y) + (y - x)| \le |z - y| + |y - x| < \delta + |y - x| \le
\varepsilon$. Note that $\varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ precisely because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, so such a $\delta$ always exists.

## Remarks

- **The radius is a real number, not a rational.** Nothing on this page tests a
  condition against rational radii only. That convention belongs to
  [[def-real-limit]], where the quantifier is over rational $\varepsilon$ and
  the passage between the rational and the real form is the sanctioned remark of
  [[def-sequence]]. Here $\varepsilon$ ranges over the positive reals
  throughout, and every statement above is proved for an arbitrary positive
  real.

- **Why the punctured version is separated out.** A limit point of a set is a
  point every punctured neighbourhood of which meets the set
  ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and deleting the centre is exactly what stops a point
  of the set from qualifying automatically. The unpunctured condition defines
  the weaker notion of an adherent point, and the difference between the two is
  precisely an isolated point.

- **Nesting is the workhorse.** Almost every openness verification on this page
  has the shape "given $y$ in the set, shrink the radius by the distance
  already travelled", which is the nesting property above. It is recorded here
  once so that no later proof has to redo the triangle inequality in passing.

## Definition

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ ([[def-field]]) together with a subset
$P \subseteq F$, the set of **positive** elements (the *positive cone*),
satisfying:

- **(O1) Trichotomy.** For each $x \in F$, exactly one of the following holds:
  $x \in P$, or $x = 0$, or $-x \in P$.
- **(O2) Closure.** If $x, y \in P$ then $x + y \in P$ and $x \cdot y \in P$.

We write $x > 0$ for $x \in P$ (read "$x$ is positive"), and define the order by

$$a < b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; b - a \in P, \qquad a \le b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; a < b \text{ or } a = b.$$

Thus $a > b$ means $b < a$, and $a \ge b$ means $b \le a$. An element $x$ with
$-x \in P$ (equivalently $x < 0$) is called **negative**.

## Remarks

- By trichotomy applied to $b - a$, for any $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$,
  $a = b$, $a > b$ holds; this makes $\le$ a total order.
- (O2) says the positives are closed under addition and multiplication: sums and
  products of positives are positive.
- The rationals ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and both constructions of the reals
  ([[thm-reals-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-dedekind-ordered-field]]) are ordered
  fields, so every fact proved here from (O1)-(O2) holds in each of them.

## Definition

A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals **converges** to $x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for
every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with
$|x_k - x| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$. It is **Cauchy** when for
every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with
$|x_k - x_l| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$.

## Remarks

- Quantifying over rational $\varepsilon$ loses nothing: below any real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ lies a positive rational ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).
- $|\cdot|$ is the absolute value of [[def-real-order]].

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]],
[[def-real-numbers]]) with its order and absolute value ([[def-real-order]]), and
$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers with its order ([[def-natural-numbers]],
[[def-nat-order]]).

A **sequence of reals** is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$. We write
$x_k$ for the value $x(k)$, call it the **$k$-th term**, and write $(x_k)$, or
$(x_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$, for the function itself. The **range** of $(x_k)$ is
the subset $\{\, x_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals and let $P$ be a property of indices.

- $(x_k)$ is **bounded** if there is $M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for
  every $k \in \mathbb{N}$; it is **unbounded** otherwise.
- $P$ holds **eventually** if there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $P(k)$ holds
  for every $k \ge K$.
- $P$ holds **frequently** if for every $K \in \mathbb{N}$ there is some
  $k \ge K$ for which $P(k)$ holds.
- For $K \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$K$-th tail** of $(x_k)$ is the sequence
  $x^{(K)}$ defined by $x^{(K)}_j := x_{j + K}$ for $j \in \mathbb{N}$; it is
  again a sequence of reals.
- A function $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is **strictly increasing** if
  $n_j < n_k$ whenever $j < k$. For such an $n$, the **subsequence** of $(x_k)$
  along $n$ is the composite $x \circ n$, written $(x_{n_k})_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$;
  it is again a sequence of reals.

**Convergence and Cauchyness are not defined here.** They are already fixed, for
sequences of reals, by the published [[def-real-limit]]: $(x_k)$ *converges* to
$x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is
$K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$, and $(x_k)$
is *Cauchy* when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$
with $|x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$. This page builds the
toolkit for those two notions and does not restate them. A sequence
**converges** if it converges to some real, and **diverges** if it does not.

## Remarks

- **Identification of $\mathbb{Q}$ with its image.** The map $q \mapsto \hat q$
  is an embedding of ordered fields ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and as is
  standard we write $q$ for $\hat q$, so that a rational may be compared with a
  real without further comment. [[def-real-limit]] is stated with the hat; every
  rational $\varepsilon$ occurring on this page is its image under this
  embedding.

- **Rational and real $\varepsilon$ agree.** [[def-real-limit]] tests convergence
  against every *rational* $\varepsilon > 0$, and its own remark records that
  this loses nothing. Spelled out: suppose that for every rational
  $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all
  $k \ge K$, and let $\eta > 0$ be an arbitrary *real*. Since $0 < \eta$,
  density of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) supplies a
  rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, and the index $K$
  belonging to that $\varepsilon$ satisfies $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon < \eta$ for
  all $k \ge K$. The converse implication is immediate, since every positive
  rational is a positive real. So the two formulations define the same relation,
  and the same two lines apply verbatim to the Cauchy condition and to any
  condition of the shape "for every $\varepsilon > 0$, eventually
  $\cdots < \varepsilon$". Proofs on this page therefore run the test with a real
  $\varepsilon$ wherever that is more convenient, and say so by citing this
  remark; nothing is smuggled in.

- **Constant sequences converge.** For $c \in \mathbb{R}$ the constant sequence
  $x_k := c$ converges to $c$, because $|x_k - c| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ for
  every $\varepsilon > 0$ and every $k$; it is bounded by $|c|$.

- **Eventually and frequently are dual.** $P$ holds frequently exactly when
  $\lnot P$ does not hold eventually, and $P$ holds eventually exactly when
  $\lnot P$ does not hold frequently. So the two quantifier patterns are
  negations of one another applied to the complementary property, and there is no
  third pattern hiding between them.

- **A sequence is not its range.** $(x_k)$ is a function, not a set, and the
  range does not determine the function: the sequence $x_0 = 0$, $x_k = 1$ for
  $k \ge 1$ and the sequence $y_0 = y_1 = 0$, $y_k = 1$ for $k \ge 2$ have the
  same range $\{0, 1\}$, yet they differ at $k = 1$, so they are different
  sequences. Order and repetition are part of the data and the range forgets
  both. Boundedness, on the other hand, depends only on the range.

- **Indexing.** Sequences here start at $k = 0$ because $\mathbb{N}$ contains
  $0$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]). Texts that index from $1$ describe the same
  objects up to a shift, and the shift changes nothing about convergence, by
  [[lem-limit-of-tail]].

## Example

Let $A := \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$ and define $h : A \to \mathbb{R}$ by

$$h(x) \;:=\; x \cdot \psi(1/x),$$

with $\psi$ as in [[ex-distance-to-the-integers]]. Then $0$ is a limit point of
$A$, the limit of $h$ at $0$ exists, and

$$\lim_{x \to 0} h(x) \;=\; 0 .$$

**The point of the example.** The factor $\psi(1/x)$ has no limit at $0$ at all
([[cex-psi-of-one-over-x-has-no-limit-at-zero]]), so
[[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]] cannot be applied to the product: its product
rule requires both factors to have limits. What is available is that
$\psi(1/x)$ stays inside $[0,1/2]$, and a bounded factor multiplied by one
tending to $0$ is killed. That is exactly what
[[thm-squeeze-for-function-limits]] delivers, and it delivers the *existence* of
the limit, not merely its value.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The set $A = \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$ and the function $h : A \to \mathbb{R}$, $h(x) = x \cdot \psi(1/x)$, with $\psi$ the function of [[ex-distance-to-the-integers]].

[L1] Range of $\psi$: $0 \le \psi(u) \le 1/2$ for every real $u$ ([[ex-distance-to-the-integers]], claim 2).

[L2] The limit condition ([[def-function-limit]]): $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = P$ means that for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x$ in the domain with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|f(x) - P| < \varepsilon$.

[L3] Squeeze theorem: if $f \le g \le k$ on $A \cap N^{*}_{\eta}(c)$ for some real $\eta > 0$, and the limits of $f$ and of $k$ at $c$ exist and are equal to $L$, then the limit of $g$ at $c$ exists and equals $L$ ([[thm-squeeze-for-function-limits]]).

[L4] Absolute value: $|u| \ge 0$; $|u| = 0$ exactly when $u = 0$; $|uv| = |u|\,|v|$; $|-u| = |u|$; $|u| = u$ for $u \ge 0$; and $-|u| \le u \le |u|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L5] Order and field arithmetic: $x \ne 0$ has an inverse $1/x$ ([[def-field]]); $0 < 1$, so $2 > 0$ and $1/2 > 0$ with $t/2 < t$ for $t > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]]); multiplying an inequality by a non-negative factor, and adding inequalities ([[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[lem-of-add-order]]); the order is total ([[def-ordered-field]]). Those two sources state their moves in their STRICT forms only; the non-strict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L6] Limit point and neighbourhoods ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

## Verification

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $0$ is a limit point of $A = \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$: given a real $\varepsilon > 0$, the real $\varepsilon/2$ satisfies $\varepsilon/2 > 0$, so it lies in $A$, and $0 < |\varepsilon/2 - 0| = \varepsilon/2 < \varepsilon$. [L4, L5, L6]

1.2 $h$ is defined on all of $A$, and $|h(x)| \le |x|/2$ there: for $x \in A$ we have $x \ne 0$, so $1/x$ exists, and $|h(x)| = |x| \cdot \psi(1/x)$ by [L4], while $0 \le \psi(1/x) \le 1/2$ by [L1] and $|x| \ge 0$, so multiplying the inequality $\psi(1/x) \le 1/2$ by the non-negative factor $|x|$ gives $|h(x)| \le |x|/2$. [L1, L4, L5]

1.3 The two functions $x \mapsto -|x|/2$ and $x \mapsto |x|/2$ on $A$ each have limit $0$ at $0$: given a real $\varepsilon > 0$, take $\delta := \varepsilon$; every $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - 0| < \delta$ satisfies $\bigl| |x|/2 - 0 \bigr| = |x|/2 < \varepsilon/2 < \varepsilon$, and likewise $\bigl| -|x|/2 - 0 \bigr| = |x|/2 < \varepsilon$. [L2, L4, L5]

2.1 Hence $-|x|/2 \le h(x) \le |x|/2$ for every $x \in A$, by [L4] applied to $|h(x)| \le |x|/2$. [step 1.2, L4]

3.1 The three functions satisfy $-|x|/2 \le h(x) \le |x|/2$ on all of $A$, in particular on $A \cap N^{*}_{1}(0)$, and the two outer ones have limit $0$ at $0$; since $0$ is a limit point of $A$, the squeeze theorem [L3] gives that the limit of $h$ at $0$ exists and equals $0$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, step 2.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the hypotheses of the squeeze theorem are met.** The order hypothesis holds on all of $A$, so any $\eta > 0$ serves and $\eta = 1$ is taken; the two outer limits are computed by hand in step 1.3; and $0$ is a limit point of $A$ by step 1.1, which is what makes every limit here well posed ([[def-function-limit]]).

- **Nothing about $\psi$ beyond its range is used.** Replacing $\psi$ by any function with values in a fixed bounded set would give the same conclusion by the same three steps. What makes the example worth stating is the contrast with [[cex-psi-of-one-over-x-has-no-limit-at-zero]]: the same oscillating factor, multiplied by $x$ or not, is the difference between a limit existing and not.

- **The classical version of this example** is $x \sin(1/x) \to 0$ as $x \to 0$; see [[rem-classical-oscillator-is-sine-of-one-over-x]] for why this library writes $\psi$ and not $\sin$.

## Statement

**False claim:** if $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, if $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$, if
$c \in A$ is a limit point of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]) and if the limit of $f$
at $c$ exists ([[def-function-limit]]), then

$$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c) .$$

Both sides of the asserted equation are defined under the stated hypotheses: the
left because the limit is assumed to exist and is single valued
([[lem-function-limit-unique]]), the right because $c \in A$. The claim is that
they always agree, and that is false.

**Why it is tempting.** The condition $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ is imposed on
points $x$ arbitrarily close to $c$, and it feels as though $x = c$ were the
limiting case of that. It is not: [[def-function-limit]] quantifies over
$0 < |x - c| < \delta$, and the strict inequality on the left removes $x = c$
from the quantifier entirely. Changing the value of $f$ at the single point $c$
therefore changes nothing on the left-hand side and everything on the right.

**What is true.** The equation above is not a theorem but a *condition*, and it
is the condition the next page of this track takes as the definition of
continuity at $c$. This library states it as a hypothesis and never as a
consequence; hypothesis (i) of [[thm-composition-of-function-limits]] is exactly
this condition for the outer function.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The set $A := \mathbb{R}$, the point $c := 0$, and the function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x) := 0$ for $x \ne 0$ and $f(0) := 1$.

[L1] The limit condition: $\lim_{x \to c} h(x) = L$ means that for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x$ in the domain of $h$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|h(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ ([[def-function-limit]]).

[L2] Limit point: $c$ is a limit point of $S$ when every punctured neighbourhood $N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c)$ meets $S$; and punctured neighbourhoods in $\mathbb{R}$ are never empty ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] Absolute value: $|0| = 0$, and $|u| \ge 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L4] Order in $\mathbb{R}$: trichotomy, so every real either equals $0$ or does not, and never both; and $0 < 1$, so $1 \ne 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The point $c = 0$ lies in $A = \mathbb{R}$ and is a limit point of $\mathbb{R}$: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the punctured neighbourhood $N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(0)$ is nonempty and is contained in $\mathbb{R}$, so it meets $\mathbb{R}$. [L2]

1.2 $f$ is a well-defined function on $\mathbb{R}$, since by trichotomy every real either equals $0$ or does not, exclusively; and the reals $0$ and $1$ are distinct. [L4]

2.1 The limit of $f$ at $0$ exists and equals $0$: given an arbitrary real $\varepsilon > 0$, take $\delta := 1 > 0$; every $x \in \mathbb{R}$ with $0 < |x - 0| < 1$ has $|x| \ne 0$, hence $x \ne 0$, hence $f(x) = 0$ and $|f(x) - 0| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1, L3, L4]

3.1 Yet $f(0) = 1$, and $1 \ne 0 = \lim_{x \to 0} f(x)$. So at the point $c = 0$ of the domain, which is a limit point of the domain, the limit exists and differs from the value: the claim is false. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L4] ∎

## Remarks

- **The witness is the smallest possible one.** It differs from a constant function at exactly one point, and the limit cannot see that point. Any function agreeing with a constant off $c$ and taking a different value at $c$ would serve equally well; the companion page works this witness out in full, computes its one-sided limits, and shows that redefining the single value repairs the equality.

- **Where the false claim does hold.** Under the extra hypothesis that $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$ — which is what continuity at $c$ will mean — it holds trivially, and that is the only sense in which it is ever true. It is emphatically not a consequence of the limit existing.

- **The consequence for composition.** Because $f(c)$ is invisible to the limit, substituting an inner function that takes the value $c$ is not licensed by the limits alone; that is the content of [[fs-naive-composition-of-limits]], whose witness is built from this one.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$, with
$|x|$ the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]). Then

$$|x| \ge 0; \quad |x| = 0 \iff x = 0; \quad -|x| \le x \le |x|; \quad |-x| = |x|; \quad |xy| = |x|\,|y|;$$

and, for every $c > 0$, one has $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and elements $x, y \in F$.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| = u$ if $u \ge 0$, and $|u| = -u$ if $u < 0$ ([[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Ordered-field order: trichotomy holds (for each $u$ exactly one of $u > 0$, $u = 0$, $u < 0$), $a < b$ means $b - a$ is positive, and sums and products of positives are positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Signs in products: $(-a)b = -(ab)$ and $(-a)(-b) = ab$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] Sign rules: a product of two elements of the same sign is positive, and a product of two elements of opposite sign is negative ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Case $x > 0$: by [L1] $|x| = x > 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; since $-x < 0$ we get $|-x| = -(-x) = x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -x < 0 < x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case pos, L1, L2, algebra]

1.2 Case $x = 0$: then $|x| = |0| = 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ holds with $|x| = 0$ and $x = 0$, while $|-x| = |0| = |x|$ and $-|x| = 0 \le 0 \le 0 = |x|$. [assume-case zero, L1]

1.3 Case $x < 0$: by [L1] $|x| = -x$, and [L2] gives $-x > 0$, so $|x| > 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; here $|-x| = -x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -(-x) = x \le x$ while $x < 0 < -x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case neg, L1, L2, algebra]

1.4 Case $x = 0$ or $y = 0$: then $xy = 0$, so $|xy| = 0$, and one of $|x|, |y|$ is $0$, whence $|x|\,|y| = 0 = |xy|$. [assume-case zerofactor, L1]

1.5 Case $x, y$ have the same sign (both positive or both negative): by [L4] $xy > 0$, so $|xy| = xy$, while $|x|\,|y| = xy$ by [L3] (for $x, y < 0$ this is $(-x)(-y) = xy$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case same, L1, L3, L4]

1.6 Case $x, y$ have opposite signs (one positive, one negative): by [L4] $xy < 0$, so $|xy| = -(xy)$, while $|x|\,|y| = -(xy)$ by [L3] (namely $x(-y)$ or $(-x)y$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case opposite, L1, L3, L4]

2.1 By trichotomy [L2] each $x$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.1-1.3, and in each we verified $|x| \ge 0$, that $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$, that $|-x| = |x|$, and that $-|x| \le x \le |x|$; hence all four hold for every $x$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, cases-exhaustive]

2.2 By trichotomy [L2] each pair $x, y$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.4-1.6, and in each $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$ for all $x, y$. [step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6, cases-exhaustive]

3.1 Let $c > 0$: if $|x| < c$ then $-c < -|x| \le x \le |x| < c$ by [step 2.1] and [L2], so $-c < x < c$; conversely if $-c < x < c$ then both $x < c$ and $-x < c$, and since $|x|$ equals $x$ or $-x$ by [L1], we get $|x| < c$, so $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$. [step 2.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b, c, d \in F$.

1. **Translation invariance.** If $a < b$ then $a + c < b + c$.
2. **Adding inequalities.** If $a < b$ and $c < d$ then $a + c < b + d$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b, c, d \in F$.

[L1] For $x, y \in F$, the relation $x < y$ means $y - x \in P$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] $P$ is closed under addition: if $u, v \in P$ then $u + v \in P$ (axiom O2 of [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a < b$; by the definition of the order this means $b - a \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.2 For every $c \in F$ the field identities give $(b + c) - (a + c) = b - a$. [algebra]

1.3 Assume moreover $c < d$; by the definition of the order this means $d - c \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.4 The field identities give $(b + d) - (a + c) = (b - a) + (d - c)$. [algebra]

2.1 Hence $(b + c) - (a + c) = b - a \in P$, which is exactly $a + c < b + c$, proving claim 1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1]

2.2 Since $b - a \in P$ and $d - c \in P$, closure under addition gives $(b - a) + (d - c) \in P$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, L2]

3.1 Therefore $(b + d) - (a + c) = (b - a) + (d - c) \in P$, which is exactly $a + c < b + d$, proving claim 2. [step 1.4, step 2.2, L1] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b, c \in F$.

1. If $a > 0$ and $b > 0$ then $ab > 0$.
2. If $a > 0$ and $b < 0$ then $ab < 0$.
3. If $a < 0$ and $b < 0$ then $ab > 0$.
4. If $c > 0$ then $a < b \iff ac < bc$.
5. If $c < 0$ then $a < b \iff bc < ac$ (multiplication by a negative reverses order).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b, c \in F$.

[L1] For $x, y \in F$: $x < y \iff y - x \in P$; $x > 0 \iff x \in P$; $x < 0 \iff -x \in P$; and (trichotomy) for each $x$ exactly one of $x \in P$, $x = 0$, $-x \in P$ holds, so $0 \notin P$ and $x \in P \Rightarrow x \neq 0$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] $P$ is closed under multiplication: if $u, v \in P$ then $uv \in P$ (axiom O2 of [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] In any field, $(-u)v = -(uv)$ and $(-u)(-v) = uv$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] In any field, $0 \cdot u = 0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a > 0$ and $b > 0$, i.e. $a \in P$ and $b \in P$; closure gives $ab \in P$, so $ab > 0$, proving claim 1. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.2 Assume $a > 0$ and $b < 0$, i.e. $a \in P$ and $-b \in P$; closure gives $a(-b) \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.3 Assume $a < 0$ and $b < 0$, i.e. $-a \in P$ and $-b \in P$; closure gives $(-a)(-b) \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.4 Assume $c > 0$ and $a < b$, i.e. $c \in P$ and $b - a \in P$; closure gives $(b - a)c \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.5 Assume $c < 0$ and $a < b$, i.e. $-c \in P$ and $b - a \in P$; closure gives $(b - a)(-c) \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

2.1 Since $a(-b) = -(ab)$ by L3, step 1.2 gives $-(ab) \in P$, so $ab < 0$, proving claim 2. [step 1.2, L3, L1]

2.2 Since $(-a)(-b) = ab$ by L3, step 1.3 gives $ab \in P$, so $ab > 0$, proving claim 3. [step 1.3, L3, L1]

2.3 By distributivity $(b - a)c = bc - ac$, so step 1.4 gives $bc - ac \in P$, i.e. $ac < bc$: this is the forward direction of claim 4. [step 1.4, algebra, L1]

2.4 By L3 and distributivity $(b - a)(-c) = -((b - a)c) = -(bc - ac) = ac - bc$, so step 1.5 gives $ac - bc \in P$, i.e. $bc < ac$: this is the forward direction of claim 5. [step 1.5, L3, algebra, L1]

3.1 Conversely, assume $c > 0$ and $ac < bc$; by trichotomy exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds. If $a = b$ then $ac = bc$, contradicting $ac < bc$; if $b < a$ then the argument of step 2.3 applied to the pair $b < a$ gives $bc < ac$, so $bc - ac \in P$ (from $ac < bc$) while $ac - bc \in P$ (from $bc < ac$), putting the element $bc - ac$ and its negative $ac - bc$ both in $P$, which trichotomy forbids; hence $a < b$: this completes claim 4. [assume-hyp, step 2.3, L4, L1, algebra]

4.1 Conversely, assume $c < 0$ and $bc < ac$; by trichotomy exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds. If $a = b$ then $ac = bc$, contradicting $bc < ac$; if $b < a$ then the argument of step 2.4 applied to the pair $b < a$ gives $ac < bc$, so $ac - bc \in P$ (from $bc < ac$) while $bc - ac \in P$ (from $ac < bc$), putting the element $ac - bc$ and its negative $bc - ac$ both in $P$, which trichotomy forbids; hence $a < b$: this completes claim 5.

## Statement

Write $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the image of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$
under the canonical embedding $q \mapsto \hat q$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), the
set usually written $\mathbb{Q}$ once the identification is made, and put
$X := \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the irrationals. Then:

1. $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$, that is,
   $\overline{\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}} = \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]);
2. $X$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$;
3. every nonempty open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable
   ([[def-countable]]).

Claim 2 is not a symmetry of claim 1: the rationals are dense because they are
*constructed* to approximate, whereas the irrationals are dense because there are
too many points in any interval for a countable set to exhaust it, which is why
claim 3 is proved alongside and used for it.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The canonical embedding $q \mapsto \hat q$ of $\mathbb{Q}$ into $\mathbb{R}$, its image $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, and the complement $X = \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$.

[L1] $\overline{A}$ is the set of points every neighbourhood of which meets $A$; $A$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ when $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L2] $N_\varepsilon(x) = (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon)$ for real $\varepsilon > 0$, and $x - \varepsilon < x + \varepsilon$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L3] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L4] Strictly between any two reals lies an element of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, and $q \mapsto \hat q$ is injective ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L5] $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-rationals-countable]]); an injection is a bijection onto its image, and $\approx$ is symmetric and transitive ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]], [[def-equinumerous]]).

[L6] Every subset of an at most countable set is at most countable, and uncountable means not at most countable ([[lem-subset-of-countable]], [[def-countable]]).

[L7] For $a < b$ the interval $(a,b)$ is uncountable ([[cor-interval-uncountable]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is dense: let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real; by [L2] one has $x - \varepsilon < x + \varepsilon$, so [L4] supplies $\hat q$ with $x - \varepsilon < \hat q < x + \varepsilon$, that is $\hat q \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$. Every real is therefore an adherent point of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and claim 1 follows from [L1]. [L1, L2, L4]

1.2 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is at most countable: the embedding is an injection of $\mathbb{Q}$ with image $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, hence a bijection onto it, so $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \approx \mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$. [L4, L5]

1.3 For all reals $a < b$ the interval $(a,b)$ is uncountable. [L7]

2.1 For all reals $a < b$ the interval $(a,b)$ contains an irrational: if it did not, then $(a,b) \subseteq \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, so $(a,b)$ would be a subset of an at most countable set by step 1.2 and hence at most countable by [L6], contradicting step 1.3. So some $z \in (a,b)$ lies in $X$. [step 1.2, step 1.3, L6]

2.2 Every nonempty open $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is uncountable: fix $x \in U$ and, by [L3], a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; by [L2] the set $N_\varepsilon(x)$ is the interval $(x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon)$ with $x - \varepsilon < x + \varepsilon$, hence uncountable by step 1.3. Were $U$ at most countable, its subset $N_\varepsilon(x)$ would be at most countable by [L6], which it is not; so $U$ is uncountable, which is claim 3. [step 1.3, L2, L3, L6, choose]

3.1 $X$ is dense: let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real; applying step 2.1 with $a = x - \varepsilon$ and $b = x + \varepsilon$ gives $z \in (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon) \cap X$, which is $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap X$ by [L2]. Every real is therefore an adherent point of $X$, so $\overline{X} = \mathbb{R}$ by [L1], which is claim 2. [step 2.1, L1, L2]

4.1 Claims 1, 2 and 3 are steps 1.1, 3.1 and 2.2, so both $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and its complement are dense in $\mathbb{R}$ and every nonempty open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable. [step 1.1, step 2.2, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Two dense sets can be disjoint.** $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and $X$ partition
  $\mathbb{R}$ and both are dense, so density says nothing about size: one of
  them is countable and the other is not
  ([[cor-irrationals-uncountable]]). What density does say is that neither has
  interior: a set whose complement is dense has empty interior, which is the
  computation carried out for $\mathbb{Q}$ in
  [[ex-closure-interior-boundary-of-q]].

- **Claim 3 is a statement about open sets, not about intervals.** It follows
  from the uncountability of intervals ([[cor-interval-uncountable]]) only
  because openness supplies an interval inside the set at each of its points.
  A nonempty set with empty interior can perfectly well be countable, as
  $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ shows.

- **An explicit irrational is not produced here.** Step 2.1 is a counting
  argument and exhibits nothing. The library does exhibit one separately,
  $\sqrt 2$ ([[thm-of-square-roots]], [[fs-sqrt2-rational]]), and an explicit
  irrational in a given interval $(a,b)$ can be built from it as
  $q_1 + (q_2 - q_1)/\sqrt 2$ for suitable rationals $q_1 < q_2$ in the
  interval; that route is longer and is not the one taken above.

## Statement

The map $q \mapsto \hat q$ ([[def-real-numbers]]) is an embedding of ordered
fields. Every real is approximated by rationals: for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and
rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ with
$|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$. Consequently, strictly between any two
reals lies a rational.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real $x = [(a_n)]$ and a rational $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] The orders of $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}$; ordered-field arithmetic ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Field arithmetic in $\mathbb{Q}$: $\varepsilon/2, \delta/4$ are positive rationals, and every nonzero rational $q$ has a reciprocal $1/q$ with $q \cdot (1/q) = 1$ ([[thm-rat-field]]).

[L3] Cauchy definition ([[def-rational-cauchy-sequence]]).

[L4] Real positivity via eventual rational lower bounds ([[def-real-order]]).

[L5] $\mathbb{R} = \mathcal{C}/\mathcal{N}$ is a field ([[thm-reals-field]]), and $0_{\mathbb{R}} = \hat 0$, $1_{\mathbb{R}} = \hat 1$ are the classes of the constant sequences ([[def-real-numbers]]). A multiplicative inverse there is unique: if $ab = 1_{\mathbb{R}} = ac$ then $b = b(ac) = (ba)c = c$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Embedding: constant sequences are Cauchy; $\hat q = \hat r$ iff the constant $q - r$ is null iff $q = r$; operations match termwise; and $q < r$ gives the constant lower bound $r - q > 0$, so $\hat q < \hat r$ and order is preserved and reflected. [L1, L4]

1.2 Fix $N$ with $|a_m - a_n| < \varepsilon/2$ for all $m, n \ge N$, and set $q = a_N$. [L3, L2]

2.1 The difference $\hat q - x$ has representative $(a_N - a_n)$ with $|a_N - a_n| < \varepsilon/2$ for $n \ge N$; hence both $\hat\varepsilon - (x - \hat q)$ and $\hat\varepsilon - (\hat q - x)$ have representatives eventually $> \varepsilon/2$, so both are positive: $|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$. [step 1.2, L4, L1]

2.2 Inverses: let $q$ be a nonzero rational. Then $\hat q \ne \hat 0 = 0_{\mathbb{R}}$ by the injectivity of step 1.1, and $1/q$ exists in $\mathbb{Q}$ by [L2]; since the operations match termwise (step 1.1), $\hat q \cdot \widehat{1/q} = \widehat{q \cdot (1/q)} = \hat 1 = 1_{\mathbb{R}}$. Inverses in $\mathbb{R}$ are unique by [L5], so $(\hat q)^{-1} = \widehat{1/q}$: the embedding preserves reciprocals. [step 1.1, L2, L5]

3.1 Density: let $x < y$; pick $\delta > 0$ rational and $N$ with the representative of $y - x$ eventually $> \delta$; set $\varepsilon = \delta/4$ and pick $q$ with $|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$; then $q' = q + 2\varepsilon$ satisfies $\hat q' - x \ge -\hat\varepsilon + 2\hat\varepsilon = \hat\varepsilon > 0$ and $y - \hat q' \ge \hat\delta - \hat\varepsilon - 2\hat\varepsilon = \hat\delta/4 > 0$, so $x < \hat q' < y$. [step 2.1, L4, L1, L2]

4.1 The rationals embed as an ordered subfield — injectively, preserving the order in both directions, the ring operations, and reciprocals — and they approximate every real arbitrarily well and separate any two reals. [step 1.1, step 2.2, step 3.1] ∎

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}$, with closure as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]] and sequences and convergence as in
[[def-sequence]] and [[def-real-limit]]. Then

$$x \in \overline{A} \iff \text{there is a sequence } (a_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \text{ with } a_k \in A \text{ for every } k \text{ and } a_k \to x .$$

Consequently $A$ is closed if and only if it is **sequentially closed**: whenever
a sequence with all its terms in $A$ converges, its limit lies in $A$.

**The right-to-left direction is choice free; the left-to-right direction spends
$\mathrm{AC}_\omega$** ([[def-countable-choice]]). Producing a sequence from a
point of the closure requires selecting one point of $A$ from each of the
countably many sets $N_{1/(k+1)}(x) \cap A$, and this library has no canonical
rule for that selection, so the axiom of countable choice is invoked
explicitly at step 2.2 and nowhere else.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a real $x$. Sequences are functions on $\mathbb{N}$, which contains $0$, so a sequence is $(a_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ and the radii used below are $1/(k+1)$ rather than $1/k$ ([[def-sequence]]).

[L1] $\overline{A}$ is exactly the set of adherent points of $A$, that is, of points every neighbourhood of which meets $A$; and $A$ is closed exactly when $A = \overline{A}$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L2] $N_\varepsilon(x) = \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}$ for real $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L3] $(a_k) \to x$ means: for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|a_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$ ([[def-real-limit]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L4] Strictly between any two reals lies a rational; in particular for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a rational $q$ with $0 < q < \varepsilon$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L5] Reciprocal Archimedean property: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]]).

[L6] Canonical naturals: $n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ and $m \le n$ in $\mathbb{N}$ gives $m \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} \le n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]); a positive element has a positive inverse and $0 < a \le b$ gives $0 < 1/b \le 1/a$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

[L7] Countable choice: for every family $(X_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of nonempty sets there is a function $f$ with domain $\mathbb{N}$ such that $f(k) \in X_k$ for every $k$ ([[def-countable-choice]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For the right-to-left implication, assume $a_k \in A$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and $a_k \to x$, and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real. [assume-hyp, L3]

1.2 For the left-to-right implication, assume $x \in \overline{A}$; then for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ the radius $1/(k+1)$ is a positive real and the set $X_k := N_{1/(k+1)}(x) \cap A$ is nonempty, because $x$ is an adherent point of $A$ by [L1]. [assume-hyp, L1, L2, L6]

2.1 Fix a rational $q$ with $0 < q < \varepsilon$ by [L4], and then $K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|a_k - x| < q$ for all $k \ge K$ by [L3]; in particular $|a_K - x| < q < \varepsilon$, so $a_K \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ and that intersection is nonempty. As $\varepsilon$ was an arbitrary positive real, $x$ is an adherent point of $A$, hence $x \in \overline{A}$ by [L1]. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L3, L4, choose]

2.2 Apply [L7] to the family $(X_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of step 1.2 and fix $f$ with $f(k) \in X_k$ for every $k$; putting $a_k := f(k)$ gives a sequence with $a_k \in A$ and $|a_k - x| < 1/(k+1)$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 1.2, L2, L7, choose]

3.1 That sequence converges to $x$: let $\varepsilon > 0$ be rational, fix by [L5] a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$, and put $K := n - 1$, a natural number since $n \ge 1$; for every $k \ge K$ one has $k + 1 \ge n \ge 1$, hence $0 < 1/(k+1) \le 1/n < \varepsilon$ by [L6], and therefore $|a_k - x| < 1/(k+1) < \varepsilon$. [step 2.2, L3, L5, L6, choose]

4.1 Step 2.1 gives the implication from right to left and steps 2.2 and 3.1 give it from left to right, so $x \in \overline{A}$ holds exactly when some sequence with all terms in $A$ converges to $x$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1]

4.2 Sequential closedness: if $A$ is closed and a sequence with all terms in $A$ converges to some $y$, then $y \in \overline{A}$ by step 2.1 and $\overline{A} = A$ by [L1], so $y \in A$; conversely, if every convergent sequence with terms in $A$ has its limit in $A$, then any $y \in \overline{A}$ is the limit of the sequence produced by steps 2.2 and 3.1, hence lies in $A$, so $\overline{A} \subseteq A$, and with $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ this gives $A = \overline{A}$, that is, $A$ is closed. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, L1]

5.1 Both assertions of the statement are proved, namely the sequential description of the closure in step 4.1 and the equivalence of closedness with sequential closedness in step 4.2. [step 4.1, step 4.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the choice is spent, and why it cannot be avoided here.** Step 2.2 is
  the only appeal to [[def-countable-choice]]. A canonical selection would
  require a rule picking a distinguished element of an arbitrary nonempty subset
  of $\mathbb{R}$, and $\mathbb{R}$ carries no well-ordering that this library
  has constructed, so this library has no such rule to offer. Contrast
  [[lem-subset-of-countable]] and [[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]], where
  the selection is from subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ and the least element is
  canonical.

- **The choice is genuinely confined to one direction.** Step 2.1 selects a
  single rational $q$ and a single index $K$ for one $\varepsilon$ at a time, and
  finitely many selections need no choice principle. So "the limit of a
  convergent sequence in a closed set lies in the set" is a theorem of ZF, and
  only the production of a sequence out of a point of the closure is not.

- **The indices start at $0$.** Since $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
  ([[def-sequence]]), the shrinking radii are $1/(k+1)$ and not $1/k$; the
  latter is undefined at $k = 0$. The threshold in step 3.1 is $K = n - 1$ for
  the same reason, and $n \ge 1$ is exactly what makes $K$ a natural number.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with closure $\overline{A}$ as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]] and derived set $A'$ as in
[[def-limit-point-r]]. Write

$$E \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing \text{ for every real } \varepsilon > 0 \,\}$$

for the set of adherent points of $A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). Then:

1. $\overline{A} = E$.
2. $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$.
3. $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed superset of $A$: it is closed, it
   contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed $F$ with $A \subseteq F$.
4. $A$ is closed if and only if $A = \overline{A}$, if and only if
   $A' \subseteq A$.

Claim 3 is the content of the definition of $\overline{A}$ and is restated here
so that the four descriptions stand together; claims 1, 2 and 4 are the ones
that carry work.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, and the set $E$ of adherent points of $A$ as displayed in the Statement.

[L1] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; $F$ is closed when $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L2] $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$; $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) = N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$; and if $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ then $\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ and $N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] $\overline{A}$ is the intersection of the nonempty family of closed supersets of $A$; it is closed, it contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed superset of $A$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]).

[L4] $x$ is an adherent point of $A$ when every $N_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $A$, a limit point when every $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $A$, and $A'$ is the set of limit points ([[def-limit-point-r]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $A \subseteq E$: for $x \in A$ and any $\varepsilon > 0$ one has $x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$, so that intersection is nonempty. [L2, L4]

1.2 Let $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus E$; by the definition of $E$ there is a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$. [L4, choose]

1.3 Let $F$ be closed with $A \subseteq F$, and let $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus F$; since $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open there is a real $\eta > 0$ with $N_\eta(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus F$. [L1, choose]

2.1 For every $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ the radius $\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x|$ is positive and $N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, so $N_\delta(y) \cap A = \varnothing$ and $y \notin E$; hence $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$, and since $x$ was an arbitrary point of $\mathbb{R} \setminus E$ that set is open, that is, $E$ is closed. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L4]

2.2 From $N_\eta(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus F \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus A$ we get $N_\eta(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, so $x \notin E$; hence $\mathbb{R} \setminus F \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$, that is, $E \subseteq F$, for every closed $F \supseteq A$. [step 1.3, L4]

3.1 By steps 1.1 and 2.1 the set $E$ is a closed superset of $A$, so $\overline{A} \subseteq E$ by the leastness in [L3]; and $\overline{A}$ is itself a closed superset of $A$ by [L3], so step 2.2 applied to $F = \overline{A}$ gives $E \subseteq \overline{A}$. Hence $\overline{A} = E$, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, L3]

4.1 $E = A \cup A'$: if $x \in E$ and $x \notin A$ then for every $\varepsilon > 0$ some $a \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ exists, and $a \ne x$ because $x \notin A$, so $a \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ and $x \in A'$; conversely $A \subseteq E$ by step 1.1, and $A' \subseteq E$ because $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$. Combining with step 3.1 gives $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$, which is claim 2. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L2, L4]

5.1 Claim 4: if $A$ is closed then $A$ is a closed superset of itself, so $\overline{A} \subseteq A$ by [L3], while $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ by [L3], whence $A = \overline{A}$; conversely if $A = \overline{A}$ then $A$ is closed because $\overline{A}$ is. Finally $A = \overline{A}$ says $A = A \cup A'$ by step 4.1, and $A = A \cup A'$ holds exactly when $A' \subseteq A$. [step 4.1, L3]

6.1 Claim 3 is [L3] restated, and claims 1, 2 and 4 are steps 3.1, 4.1 and 5.1, so all four hold. [step 3.1, step 4.1, step 5.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Which claim does the work in practice.** Claim 1 is the one used almost
  everywhere below: to show a point lies in $\overline{A}$ one exhibits, for each
  $\varepsilon > 0$, a point of $A$ within $\varepsilon$ of it. Claim 2 is what
  separates the two ways a point can be adherent, by membership or by
  accumulation, and it is what makes the notion of an isolated point visible.

- **No special property of $\mathbb{R}$ is used.** The argument uses the
  definitions of open, closed, neighbourhood and closure, and the order enters
  only through the nesting property of neighbourhoods; neither the
  least-upper-bound property nor the Archimedean property appears at any step.
  The results of this page that do use them are flagged in
  [[rem-r-native-topology-scope]].

- **The sequential form is a separate theorem and costs more.** Replacing
  "every neighbourhood meets $A$" by "some sequence in $A$ converges to $x$" is
  [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]], and the passage from the
  first to the second spends the axiom of countable choice, since it selects one
  point of $A$ from each of infinitely many neighbourhoods. The characterisation
  proved above is choice free.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $c$ be a limit point of $A$
([[def-limit-point-r]]) and let $f, g, h : A \to \mathbb{R}$. Suppose there is a
real $\eta > 0$ with

$$f(x) \le g(x) \le h(x) \qquad \text{for every } x \in A \text{ with } 0 < |x - c| < \eta ,$$

and suppose the limits of $f$ and of $h$ at $c$ exist and are equal, say
$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = \lim_{x \to c} h(x) = L$ ([[def-function-limit]]). Then
the limit of $g$ at $c$ **exists**, and

$$\lim_{x \to c} g(x) \;=\; \lim_{x \to c} f(x) \;=\; \lim_{x \to c} h(x) \;=\; L .$$

**This is the one result on this page that produces a limit rather than
computing one.** No hypothesis whatever is placed on $g$ beyond the two
inequalities: $g$ may be wildly irregular, as $x \mapsto x\,\psi(1/x)$ on the
companion page is, and the theorem still delivers its limit at $c$.

The proof is a direct $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ argument and uses no choice
principle.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a limit point $c$ of $A$, functions $f, g, h : A \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\eta > 0$ with $f(x) \le g(x) \le h(x)$ for every $x \in A$ satisfying $0 < |x - c| < \eta$, and a real $L$ with $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$ and $\lim_{x \to c} h(x) = L$ ([[def-function-limit]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L1] The limit condition: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$, and likewise for $h$ ([[def-function-limit]]).

[L2] Absolute value: for $t > 0$, $|u| < t$ is equivalent to $-t < u < t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L3] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: the order is transitive, and mixed chains compose, so $u < v \le w$ gives $u < w$ and $u \le v < w$ gives $u < w$; adding a constant to an inequality ([[lem-of-add-order]]); of finitely many positive reals the smallest is positive, the order being total ([[def-ordered-field]]). [[lem-of-add-order]] states its moves in their STRICT forms only; the non-strict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide, the order being total ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L4] Neighbourhoods: $N^{*}_{\delta}(c) = \{\, y : 0 < |y - c| < \delta \,\}$, and a smaller radius gives a smaller punctured neighbourhood ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real. By [L1] fix reals $\delta_1, \delta_2 > 0$ such that every $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta_1$ satisfies $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ and every $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta_2$ satisfies $|h(x) - L| < \varepsilon$; let $\delta$ be the smallest of $\delta_1$, $\delta_2$ and $\eta$, so $\delta > 0$. [L1, L3, L4, choose]

2.1 Let $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$. Then $0 < |x - c| < \delta_1$ gives $L - \varepsilon < f(x)$, and $0 < |x - c| < \delta_2$ gives $h(x) < L + \varepsilon$, while $0 < |x - c| < \eta$ gives $f(x) \le g(x) \le h(x)$. [step 1.1, L2, L3, L4]

3.1 Chaining those four inequalities, $L - \varepsilon < f(x) \le g(x) \le h(x) < L + \varepsilon$, hence $L - \varepsilon < g(x) < L + \varepsilon$, that is $-\varepsilon < g(x) - L < \varepsilon$, that is $|g(x) - L| < \varepsilon$. [step 2.1, L2, L3]

4.1 So for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ a real $\delta > 0$ has been produced with $|g(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ for every $x \in A$ satisfying $0 < |x - c| < \delta$: the limit of $g$ at $c$ exists and equals $L$. [step 3.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the three hypotheses are spent.** The inequality $f \le g$ is used only for the lower estimate and $g \le h$ only for the upper one; the equality of the two outer limits is what makes the two estimates close on the same number $L$. Drop it and the argument gives only $\lim f \le \liminf$-style information, which this page does not develop.

- **The order hypothesis is local.** It is imposed only on $A \cap N^{*}_{\eta}(c)$, so the theorem is insensitive to the behaviour of the three functions far from $c$, and to their values at $c$; that is [[lem-limit-is-local]] in action.

- **Typical use.** To prove that a bounded oscillating factor is killed by a factor tending to $0$: if $|u(x)| \le B$ near $c$ then $-B|x - c| \le (x - c)u(x) \le B|x - c|$ near $c$, and both outer functions tend to $0$. That is exactly how $x\,\psi(1/x) \to 0$ is proved on the companion page.

- **The sequential analogue** is [[thm-squeeze]].
