## Statement

Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals with $a_k > 0$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$,
and put $q_k := a_{k+1}/a_k$, which is the ratio family of [[thm-ratio-test]]
since $|a_k| = a_k$ here. Take the constant weights $\zeta_k := 1$, so that
Kummer's expression ([[thm-kummer-test]]) is

$$K_k \;=\; \frac{a_k}{a_{k+1}} - 1 \qquad (k \in \mathbb{N}) .$$

Then:

1. if $\limsup_{k} q_k < 1$ then $\liminf_{k} K_k > 0$, so Kummer's convergence
   criterion applies and yields convergence of $\sum a_k$;
2. if $\liminf_{k} q_k > 1$ then $\sum 1/\zeta_k$ diverges and $K_k \le 0$ from
   some index on, so Kummer's divergence criterion applies and yields divergence
   of $\sum a_k$.

Both conclusions are exactly those of [[thm-ratio-test]] for a sequence of
positive terms. So the ratio test is the constant-weight case of Kummer's test,
and every strengthening of Kummer's test by a better choice of weights is a
strengthening of the ratio test.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(a_k)$ of reals with $a_k > 0$ for every $k$; the ratios $q_k = a_{k+1}/a_k$, which are positive; the constant weights $\zeta_k = 1$; and Kummer's expression $K_k = a_k/a_{k+1} - 1$ ([[thm-kummer-test]], [[def-limsup-liminf]]).

[L1] Every subset of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ has a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound there ([[lem-extended-reals-complete]], [[def-extended-reals]]); $\limsup_k x_k = \inf\{s_n\}$ and $\liminf_k x_k = \sup\{i_n\}$ with $s_n, i_n$ the tail bounds, and both exist for every sequence ([[def-limsup-liminf]], [[lem-limsup-exists]]).

[L2] Kummer's test, in both halves, for positive terms and positive weights ([[thm-kummer-test]]).

[L3] Reciprocation on the positives: $0 < x < y$ implies $0 < 1/y < 1/x$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

[L4] A series whose terms do not tend to $0$ diverges ([[lem-nth-term-test]]).

[L5] For positive terms $|a_k| = a_k$, so the ratio family of [[thm-ratio-test]] is the family $q_k$ above ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The constant weights $\zeta_k = 1$ are positive, and the terms $a_k$ are positive, so Kummer's test applies with these data and its expression is $K_k = a_k/a_{k+1} - 1$. [given, L2]

1.2 Each $q_k$ is positive, so $\limsup_k q_k \ge 0$, every tail supremum being at least $q_n > 0$. [given, L1]

1.3 Suppose instead $\liminf_k q_k > 1$. The real $1$ is not an upper bound of $\{i'_n\}$, the tail infima of $(q_k)$, so there is $N$ with $i'_N > 1$, and then $q_k \ge i'_N > 1$ for every $k \ge N$. [given, L1, choose]

1.4 The weight series $\sum 1/\zeta_k$ is $\sum 1$, whose terms are constantly $1$ and so do not tend to $0$; it diverges. [given, L4]

2.1 Suppose $\limsup_k q_k < 1$. Then $\Lambda := \limsup_k q_k$ lies between the reals $0$ and $1$ and is therefore real; put $t := (\Lambda+1)/2$, so that $\Lambda < t < 1$ and $t \ge 1/2 > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, choose]

2.2 For $k \ge N$: $a_{k+1}/a_k > 1$ gives $a_{k+1} > a_k > 0$, hence $a_k/a_{k+1} < 1$, hence $K_k < 0$ and in particular $K_k \le 0$. [step 1.3, L3, algebra]

3.1 Since $t > \inf\{s_n\}$, the real $t$ is not a lower bound of $\{s_n\}$, so there is $N$ with $s_N < t$, and then $q_k \le s_N < t$ for every $k \ge N$. [step 2.1, L1, choose]

3.2 Kummer's divergence criterion therefore applies and $\sum a_k$ diverges, which is claim 2. [step 2.2, step 1.4, step 1.1, L2]

4.1 For $k \ge N$: $0 < a_{k+1}/a_k < t$, so $a_k/a_{k+1} > 1/t$, and hence $K_k = a_k/a_{k+1} - 1 > 1/t - 1 =: c$, where $c > 0$ because $0 < t < 1$ gives $1/t > 1$. [step 3.1, L3, algebra]

5.1 So $c$ is a lower bound of $\{K_k : k \ge N\}$, whence $i_N \ge c$ and $\liminf_k K_k = \sup\{i_n\} \ge i_N \ge c > 0$. [step 4.1, L1]

6.1 Kummer's convergence criterion therefore applies and $\sum a_k$ converges, which is claim 1. [step 5.1, step 1.1, L2]

7.1 The hypotheses in claims 1 and 2 are precisely those of the two halves of the ratio test for this sequence, and the conclusions agree, so the ratio test for positive terms is the case $\zeta_k = 1$ of Kummer's test. [step 6.1, step 3.2, L5] ∎

## Remarks

- **What this corollary is for.** It is not a new criterion. It fixes the place of the ratio test inside the Kummer family, so that the later choices of weights on this page can be read as improvements on a known test rather than as unrelated criteria.

- **The ratio test proved earlier is more general in one respect.** It allows terms of either sign, provided none vanishes, and concludes convergence of $\sum |a_k|$. Kummer's test needs positivity throughout, so the identification above is between the positive-term case of the ratio test and the constant-weight case of Kummer's test, and it says nothing about signed terms.

The read-only DeepSeek V4 Pro audit-refuter received the complete target and every cited dependency and returned CLEAN. Boundary evidence: The proof correctly handles the extremal cases admitted by the hypotheses. If limsup < 1 then Λ is a real number in [0,1); taking t = (Λ+1)/2 gives a strict gap, and all inequalities remain strict. If liminf > 1 then the tail infimum eventually exceeds 1, so Kₖ becomes strictly negative. Sequences with qₖ → 1 from either side lie outside both hypotheses and make no claim. The extended‑real machinery is used only for existence of limsup/liminf; all quantities that appear in the inequalities are real. No counterexample to the stated implication was found (e.g., aₖ = 2⁻ᵏ satisfies limsup < 1 and yields liminf Kₖ = 1 > 0; aₖ = 2ᵏ satisfies liminf > 1 and makes Kₖ = -½ ≤ 0). The constant‑weight series ∑ 1/ζₖ = ∑ 1 diverges by the term test, and the positivity of all aₖ keeps every reciprocal well defined. Checked surface: The title, the public Statement, every numbered proof step (1.1 through 7.1), and both Remarks were read and scrutinised for mathematical accuracy, logical validity, and citation correctness.

## Definition

Fix two objects $-\infty$ and $+\infty$, distinct from one another and neither of
them a real number ([[def-real-numbers]]), and set

$$\overline{\mathbb{R}} := \mathbb{R} \cup \{-\infty, +\infty\}.$$

This is a **new object**, introduced here explicitly with its own order and its
own partial arithmetic. It is not an enlargement of the field $\mathbb{R}$, and
no operation of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) is redefined by
anything below.

**The order.** For $a, b \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ declare

$$a \le b \quad :\Longleftrightarrow \quad a = -\infty \ \text{ or } \ b = +\infty \ \text{ or } \ \big(a, b \in \mathbb{R} \text{ and } a \le b \text{ in } \mathbb{R}\big),$$

with $\mathbb{R}$ ordered as in [[def-real-order]], and write $a < b$ for
"$a \le b$ and $a \ne b$" as usual ([[def-partial-order]]).

**$(\overline{\mathbb{R}}, \le)$ is a totally ordered set, and the inclusion of
$\mathbb{R}$ preserves and reflects the order.** All four checks are immediate
from the displayed clauses.

- *Reflexive.* For $a = \pm\infty$ one of the first two clauses applies; for
  $a \in \mathbb{R}$ the third does, since $a \le a$ in $\mathbb{R}$.
- *Antisymmetric.* Suppose $a \le b$ and $b \le a$. If $a = -\infty$ then
  $b \le a$ forces $b = -\infty$, since the clause $a = +\infty$ fails and $b, a$
  are not both real. Symmetrically $b = -\infty$ forces $a = -\infty$, and
  $a = +\infty$ or $b = +\infty$ forces the other to be $+\infty$. In the one
  remaining situation $a$ and $b$ are both real and antisymmetry is that of
  $\mathbb{R}$.
- *Transitive.* Let $a \le b \le c$. If $a = -\infty$ or $c = +\infty$ the
  conclusion is one of the first two clauses. Otherwise $a \ne -\infty$ forces,
  in $a \le b$, either $b = +\infty$ or $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$; and $c \ne +\infty$
  forces, in $b \le c$, either $b = -\infty$ or $b, c \in \mathbb{R}$. The value
  $b = +\infty$ is incompatible with the second alternative pair, so $b$ is real,
  hence so are $a$ and $c$, and transitivity is that of $\mathbb{R}$.
- *Total.* If $a = -\infty$ or $b = +\infty$ then $a \le b$; if $b = -\infty$ or
  $a = +\infty$ then $b \le a$; otherwise both are real and the order of
  $\mathbb{R}$ is total.
- *Preserved and reflected.* For $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ the first two clauses fail,
  so $a \le b$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ says exactly $a \le b$ in $\mathbb{R}$.

In particular $-\infty$ is the least and $+\infty$ the greatest element of
$\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, and $-\infty < x < +\infty$ for every $x \in \mathbb{R}$.

**Reflection.** Extend negation by

$$-(+\infty) := -\infty, \qquad -(-\infty) := +\infty,$$

keeping the field negative on $\mathbb{R}$. The resulting map
$\nu : \overline{\mathbb{R}} \to \overline{\mathbb{R}}$, $\nu(a) = -a$, satisfies
$\nu(\nu(a)) = a$ and

$$a \le b \iff -b \le -a \qquad (a, b \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}).$$

For $a$ and $b$ real this is the elementwise order reversal in $\mathbb{R}$:
translation invariance ([[lem-of-add-order]]) applied with the constant $-a-b$
turns $a < b$ into $-b < -a$ and, applied with the constant $a+b$, turns it back,
while $a = b$ holds exactly when $-a = -b$. In every other case both sides are
decided by the first two clauses of the order: $a = -\infty$ makes both sides
true, as does $b = +\infty$, and if $a \ne -\infty$, $b \ne +\infty$ and $a, b$
are not both real then one of $a = +\infty$, $b = -\infty$ holds and both sides
are false.

**Partial addition.** For $a, b \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ the sum $a + b$ is
defined by

- $a + b$ = the field sum, when $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$;
- $a + b := +\infty$ when $a = +\infty$ and $b \ne -\infty$, or $b = +\infty$ and $a \ne -\infty$;
- $a + b := -\infty$ when $a = -\infty$ and $b \ne +\infty$, or $b = -\infty$ and $a \ne +\infty$;

and **the two sums $(+\infty) + (-\infty)$ and $(-\infty) + (+\infty)$ are left
undefined**. Addition is commutative where defined, and

$$-(a + b) = (-a) + (-b),$$

each side being defined exactly when the other is: the excluded pairs
$\{+\infty, -\infty\}$ are exchanged by $\nu$, and the three clauses above are
exchanged accordingly.

**Partial multiplication.** For $a, b \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ the product $ab$
is defined by

- $ab$ = the field product, when $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$;
- $ab := +\infty$ when one of $a, b$ is $\pm\infty$, the other is $\ne 0$, and both are $> 0$ or both are $< 0$;
- $ab := -\infty$ when one of $a, b$ is $\pm\infty$, the other is $\ne 0$, and one is $> 0$ and the other $< 0$;

and **every product with one factor $0$ and the other $\pm\infty$ is left
undefined**. The comparisons $> 0$ and $< 0$ here are taken in the order above,
under which $+\infty > 0 > -\infty$.

**Nothing else is defined.** There is no subtraction, no division, no
exponentiation and no absolute value on $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ in this library;
where such an expression is wanted it is written out in the two defined
operations, and where a case falls in the undefined list the statement carries an
explicit hypothesis saying so.

## Remarks

- **$\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is not a field, and not an ordered field.** It has no
  additive inverse for $+\infty$: $(+\infty) + b$ is $+\infty$ whenever it is
  defined and is never $0$. So none of the field axioms
  ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) is available here, and no algebraic
  manipulation valid in $\mathbb{R}$ may be transported to
  $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ without a separate justification.

- **Why the excluded cases are excluded.** The three defined clauses of each
  operation are exactly the cases in which the value is forced by the limiting
  behaviour of the sequences involved, and the excluded cases are exactly the
  ones in which it is not. For the product this is proved on the companion page:
  [[cex-zero-times-infinity-indeterminate]] exhibits a null sequence and two
  sequences diverging to $+\infty$ whose products behave differently, so no value
  assigned to $0 \cdot (+\infty)$ could be compatible with products of limits.
  The same phenomenon rules out a value for $(+\infty) + (-\infty)$: with
  $a_k = k$ and $b_k = -k$ the sum is constantly $0$, while with $b_k = -2k$ it
  diverges to $-\infty$. Leaving them undefined is not squeamishness, it is the
  only option that keeps every later statement about limits true without a
  side condition hidden inside the arithmetic.

- **This is the separate introduction that [[rem-sup-conventions]] points to.**
  That remark refuses the conventions $\sup S = +\infty$ and
  $\inf \emptyset = +\infty$ inside $\mathbb{R}$, and records that the extended
  real line is introduced explicitly here, with its own order and its own partial
  arithmetic kept separate from $\mathbb{R}$ rather than quietly extending it.
  This is that introduction. The suprema and infima of [[def-complete-ordered-field]],
  [[def-infimum]] and the whole suprema page remain real numbers with their
  nonempty and bounded hypotheses intact; what is new is a *separate* supremum
  operation, taken in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ and named as such, supplied by
  [[lem-extended-reals-complete]].

- **The symbols were already in circulation, and this definition does not change
  what they meant.** [[def-divergence-to-infinity]] defines the single phrase
  "$x_k \to +\infty$" as an abbreviation for a condition on $(x_k)$, and says in
  as many words that it does not define an object named $+\infty$. That reading
  is still correct: nothing in [[def-divergence-to-infinity]] is restated or
  reinterpreted here, and [[def-extended-limits]] is where the two are related, by
  a definition that quotes the old one rather than replacing it. Likewise the
  interval notation $(a, \infty)$ of [[def-interval]] is notation for a condition
  on one side, not an endpoint, and stays that way.

- **Why the order is defined by three clauses rather than by a picture.** The
  clauses are what the verifications above actually use, and they make the two
  facts that later proofs lean on immediate: every element is $\le +\infty$ and
  every element is $\ge -\infty$, with no case analysis at the point of use.

## Definition

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]). For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ let

$$T_n \;:=\; \{\, x_k : k \in \mathbb{N},\ k \ge n \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$$

be the **$n$-th tail range** of $(x_k)$, a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ since
$x_n \in T_n$. Regard $T_n$ as a subset of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$
([[def-extended-reals]]) and put

$$s_n \;:=\; \sup T_n \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}, \qquad i_n \;:=\; \inf T_n \in \overline{\mathbb{R}},$$

the supremum and infimum taken in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, which exist for every
$n$ and for every sequence by [[lem-extended-reals-complete]]. The **limit
superior** and **limit inferior** of $(x_k)$ are then

$$\limsup_{k} x_k \;:=\; \inf \{\, s_n : n \in \mathbb{N} \,\}, \qquad \liminf_{k} x_k \;:=\; \sup \{\, i_n : n \in \mathbb{N} \,\},$$

again taken in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ and again existing by
[[lem-extended-reals-complete]], since $\{s_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ and
$\{i_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ are subsets of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ on which no
hypothesis is needed. Both are elements of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, and either may
be $+\infty$ or $-\infty$. The notations $\limsup_{k \to \infty} x_k$,
$\varlimsup_k x_k$ and $\overline{\lim}_k x_k$ all denote the first of them
elsewhere; this library writes $\limsup_k x_k$.

**Every quantity written here exists, and that is why the extended line was
introduced.** Each of the four operations above is an application of
[[lem-extended-reals-complete]] to a subset of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ carrying no
hypothesis whatever. Written with the real supremum of
[[def-complete-ordered-field]] and the real infimum of [[thm-infimum-property]]
instead, the definition would be available only for sequences that are bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]): $\sup T_n$ needs $T_n$ bounded above, and
$\inf\{s_n\}$ needs $\{s_n\}$ nonempty, bounded below, and made of real numbers
([[def-infimum]]). None of those is automatic, and the discipline recorded in
[[rem-sup-conventions]] forbids papering over the gap with a convention. The
extended supremum is a different operation in a different ordered set, and it is
total.

**Values, when the sequence is bounded.** If $(x_k)$ is bounded, say
$|x_k| \le M$ for every $k$, then each $T_n$ is a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$
bounded above by $M$ and below by $-M$, so by the agreement clause of
[[lem-extended-reals-complete]] each $s_n$ and each $i_n$ is the *real* supremum
or infimum of $T_n$, and lies in $[-M, M]$. The family $\{s_n\}$ is then a
nonempty set of reals bounded below by $-M$, so $\limsup_k x_k$ is likewise the
real infimum of $\{s_n\}$ and lies in $[-M, M]$; dually for $\liminf_k x_k$. So
for a bounded sequence both quantities are ordinary real numbers computed with
the ordinary real supremum and infimum, and the extended line is doing no work.
It is only for unbounded sequences that the values $\pm\infty$ occur.

## Remarks

- **The order of the two operations is not symmetric and must be kept straight.**
  $\limsup$ is an infimum of suprema and $\liminf$ a supremum of infima. Taking
  them in the other order gives $\sup_n \sup_{k \ge n} x_k = \sup_k x_k$ and
  $\inf_n \inf_{k \ge n} x_k = \inf_k x_k$, which are the extreme values of the
  whole sequence and carry no information about its behaviour at large indices.
  The point of the definition is that the inner operation looks at a tail and the
  outer one lets the tail recede.

- **Why tails at all.** Each $s_n$ is a bound on the whole tail from index $n$ on,
  so it forgets the first $n$ terms; letting $n$ grow forgets any fixed finite
  number of them. That is what makes $\limsup$ and $\liminf$ tail quantities in
  the sense of [[lem-limit-of-tail]], and it is the reason they can characterise
  convergence, which is itself a tail property.

- **Neither quantity is a limit, and neither is claimed to be one.** The symbols
  $\limsup$ and $\liminf$ are single pieces of notation for the two displayed
  expressions, exactly as "$x_k \to +\infty$" is a single abbreviation in
  [[def-divergence-to-infinity]]. That the family $(s_n)$ does decrease to
  $\limsup_k x_k$ in a precise sense is a theorem, not part of this definition;
  the monotonicity half is [[lem-limsup-exists]].

- **The tail ranges are sets, not sequences.** $T_n$ is the range of the $n$-th
  tail, so repetitions and order are forgotten ([[def-sequence]]). That is
  harmless here, since a supremum depends only on the set of values, and it is
  what lets the whole definition be phrased with the order-theoretic operations of
  [[lem-extended-reals-complete]] and nothing else.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-real-numbers]]) and
a **sequence of reals** is a function $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$
([[def-sequence]]), written $(a_k)$; recall that $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$.

**Partial sums.** Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals. Its **sequence of partial
sums** is

$$s_n \;:=\; \sum_{k < n} a_k \qquad (n \in \mathbb{N}),$$

the finite sum of [[def-finite-sum]]. In particular $s_0 = 0$, the empty sum, and
$s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ for every $n$, those being exactly the two recursion clauses
that define the finite sum. Note that $s_n$ is the sum of the $n$ terms
$a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$, so the index $n$ counts terms rather than naming the last
one.

**Convergence, the sum, divergence.** The **series** of $(a_k)$, written
$\sum a_k$, **converges** when the sequence $(s_n)$ of partial sums converges
([[def-real-limit]]), and then the **sum of the series** is

$$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k \;:=\; \lim_{n} s_n .$$

The series **diverges** when $(s_n)$ does not converge. A convergent sequence of
reals has exactly one limit ([[lem-limit-unique]]), so the displayed symbol names
a single real number and nothing further has to be checked for it to be
well defined.

**Series with a general starting index.** Let $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $a$ be a
function on $\{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : k \ge m \,\}$, which we call a **family from
$m$** and write $(a_k)_{k \ge m}$. The series

$$\sum_{k \ge m} a_k$$

is by definition the series of the sequence $b_j := a_{j + m}$,
$j \in \mathbb{N}$, which is a genuine sequence of reals; it converges exactly
when that series converges, and its sum is then written
$\sum_{k = m}^{\infty} a_k$. Its partial sums are

$$\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k \;=\; \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j} \qquad (n \ge m),$$

in the notation of [[def-finite-sum]], the value at $n = m$ being the empty sum
$0$. A sequence on $\mathbb{N}$ is the case $m = 0$, and the two readings of
$\sum a_k$ agree there, since $b_j = a_j$.

**This clause is not a convenience.** Sequences in this library are functions on
$\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$ ([[def-sequence]]), while many of the
classical series are built from expressions that are undefined at the index $0$:
$1/k$, $1/k^{p}$ and $|a_k|^{1/k}$ all require $k \ge 1$. Writing such a series as
$\sum_{k \ge 1} a_k$ names an honest object, whereas writing it as a sequence on
$\mathbb{N}$ would require a value at an index where the defining expression has
none. Every statement on this page says which starting index it uses.

**Tail series.** For $N \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$N$-th tail series** of
$\sum a_k$ is $\sum_{k \ge N} a_k$, that is the series of the $N$-th tail
$a^{(N)}$ of [[def-sequence]], whose terms are $a^{(N)}_j = a_{j+N}$. The
$0$-th tail series is the series itself.

## Remarks

- **"Diverges" here means "does not converge", and nothing more.** A divergent
  series may have partial sums that run away to $+\infty$, or to $-\infty$, or
  that oscillate without settling anywhere. The three behaviours are not
  distinguished by the word, and no statement on this page uses "diverges" to
  mean "the partial sums are unbounded" unless it says so.

- **The symbol $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k$ is defined only for a convergent
  series.** It denotes a real number, not a formal object, and it is illegitimate
  to write it down before convergence has been established. Where a proof needs
  to speak of the series without knowing whether it converges, it speaks of
  $(a_k)$ and of $(s_n)$.

- **Two indices, doing different work.** The index $k$ runs over the terms and is
  bound; the index $n$ runs over the partial sums and is the variable in which the
  limit is taken. Confusing them is the commonest slip in the subject, and it is
  the reason the definition above fixes $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ rather than
  $\sum_{k \le n} a_k$: with this choice the recursion $s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ is
  the one supplied by [[def-finite-sum]], with no shift anywhere.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ be **any** subset of the extended real
line ([[def-extended-reals]]) and write $A_{\mathbb{R}} := A \cap \mathbb{R}$.
Then $A$ has a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound in
$\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-upper-bound]]), each unique, which we write
$\sup A$ and $\inf A$ with the ambient set always $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$.
Explicitly:

- $\sup A = +\infty$ if $+\infty \in A$, or if $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ is not bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$;
- $\sup A = -\infty$ if $+\infty \notin A$ and $A_{\mathbb{R}} = \emptyset$;
- $\sup A$ is the real supremum $\sup A_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) if $+\infty \notin A$ and $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ is nonempty and bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$;

and dually, with $-\infty$ and $+\infty$ exchanged and "above" replaced by
"below", for $\inf A$ ([[def-infimum]], [[thm-infimum-property]]).

**Agreement.** If $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and bounded above in
$\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-bounded-set]]) then $\sup A$ computed in
$\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is the real number $\sup A$ of
[[def-complete-ordered-field]]; if $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and
bounded below then $\inf A$ computed in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is the real
number $\inf A$ of [[thm-infimum-property]]. In particular the notation is
unambiguous on the sets for which the real supremum and infimum are defined, and
$\sup \emptyset = -\infty$, $\inf \emptyset = +\infty$ in
$\overline{\mathbb{R}}$.

**No hypothesis is placed on $A$.** This is exactly what the real supremum cannot
do, and it is why every $\limsup$ statement on this page holds for every sequence
rather than for bounded ones only. It is also not a weakening of the discipline
this library keeps around suprema: the operation supplied here is a *different*
operation, taken in a *different* ordered set, and the agreement clause records
exactly where the two coincide.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $A \subseteq \overline{\mathbb{R}}$, and its real part $A_{\mathbb{R}} := A \cap \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] $(\overline{\mathbb{R}}, \le)$ is a totally ordered set in which $-\infty$ is the least element and $+\infty$ the greatest, and whose order restricted to $\mathbb{R}$ is the order of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-extended-reals]], [[def-partial-order]], [[def-real-order]]).

[L2] Upper and lower bounds in a poset: $u$ is an upper bound of $A$ when $a \le u$ for all $a \in A$, and a least upper bound when moreover $u \le v$ for every upper bound $v$; dually for lower bounds and greatest lower bounds. Each is unique when it exists, by antisymmetry ([[def-upper-bound]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L3] Least-upper-bound property of $\mathbb{R}$: every nonempty $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$ has a real least upper bound $\sup S$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L4] Greatest-lower-bound property of $\mathbb{R}$: every nonempty $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ that is bounded below in $\mathbb{R}$ has a real greatest lower bound $\inf S$ ([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]).

[L5] Bounded above and bounded below in $\mathbb{R}$ mean the existence of a real upper, respectively lower, bound ([[def-bounded-set]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Case S1 for the supremum: $+\infty \in A$. [given, assume-case suptop]

1.2 Case S2 for the supremum: $+\infty \notin A$ and $A_{\mathbb{R}} = \emptyset$, so that every element of $A$ equals $-\infty$. [given, assume-case supbot]

1.3 Case S3 for the supremum: $+\infty \notin A$, $A_{\mathbb{R}} \ne \emptyset$, and $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ is bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$. [given, assume-case supfin]

1.4 Case S4 for the supremum: $+\infty \notin A$, $A_{\mathbb{R}} \ne \emptyset$, and $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ is not bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$. [given, assume-case supunb]

1.5 Case I1 for the infimum: $-\infty \in A$. [given, assume-case infbot]

1.6 Case I2 for the infimum: $-\infty \notin A$ and $A_{\mathbb{R}} = \emptyset$, so that every element of $A$ equals $+\infty$. [given, assume-case inftop]

1.7 Case I3 for the infimum: $-\infty \notin A$, $A_{\mathbb{R}} \ne \emptyset$, and $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ is bounded below in $\mathbb{R}$. [given, assume-case inffin]

1.8 Case I4 for the infimum: $-\infty \notin A$, $A_{\mathbb{R}} \ne \emptyset$, and $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ is not bounded below in $\mathbb{R}$. [given, assume-case infunb]

2.1 In case S1 the element $+\infty$ is an upper bound of $A$, being the greatest element of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$; and if $v$ is any upper bound of $A$ then $+\infty \in A$ gives $+\infty \le v$, whence $v = +\infty$ by antisymmetry. So $+\infty$ is the least upper bound of $A$. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.2 In case S2 every element of $A$ equals $-\infty$, so $-\infty$ is an upper bound of $A$ by reflexivity; and $-\infty \le v$ for every $v \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$, being the least element. So $-\infty$ is the least upper bound of $A$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.3 In case S3 the real number $\sigma := \sup A_{\mathbb{R}}$ exists, and it is an upper bound of $A$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$: an element of $A$ is either real, hence lies in $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ and satisfies $a \le \sigma$ in $\mathbb{R}$ and so in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, or equals $-\infty$, which is $\le \sigma$; the value $+\infty$ does not occur in $A$ in this case. [step 1.3, L1, L3]

2.4 In case S4 the element $+\infty$ is an upper bound of $A$; and if $v$ is an upper bound then $v \ne -\infty$, because fixing $a \in A_{\mathbb{R}}$, which is possible in this case, gives $a \le v$ with $a$ real and $-\infty$ is below no real, while $v$ real would make $v$ a real upper bound of $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ and contradict the case hypothesis. So $v = +\infty$, and $+\infty$ is the least upper bound of $A$. [step 1.4, L1, L2, L5]

2.5 In case I1 the element $-\infty$ is a lower bound of $A$, being least; and any lower bound $w$ satisfies $w \le -\infty$ because $-\infty \in A$, whence $w = -\infty$ by antisymmetry. So $-\infty$ is the greatest lower bound of $A$. [step 1.5, L1, L2]

2.6 In case I2 every element of $A$ equals $+\infty$, so $+\infty$ is a lower bound of $A$ by reflexivity, and $w \le +\infty$ for every $w$. So $+\infty$ is the greatest lower bound of $A$. [step 1.6, L1, L2]

2.7 In case I3 the real number $\iota := \inf A_{\mathbb{R}}$ exists and is a lower bound of $A$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$: an element of $A$ is either real, hence in $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ and $\ge \iota$, or equals $+\infty \ge \iota$; the value $-\infty$ does not occur in $A$ in this case. [step 1.7, L1, L4]

2.8 In case I4 the element $-\infty$ is a lower bound of $A$; any lower bound $w$ satisfies $w \ne +\infty$, because fixing $a \in A_{\mathbb{R}}$ gives $w \le a$ with $a$ real and $+\infty$ is above no real, while $w$ real would be a real lower bound of $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ and contradict the case hypothesis. So $w = -\infty$ is the greatest lower bound of $A$. [step 1.8, L1, L2, L5]

3.1 In case S3 let $v$ be any upper bound of $A$ and fix $a \in A_{\mathbb{R}}$, which is possible since $A_{\mathbb{R}} \ne \emptyset$. From $a \le v$ with $a$ real we get $v \ne -\infty$, since $-\infty$ is below no real. If $v = +\infty$ then $\sigma \le v$ because $+\infty$ is greatest. Otherwise $v$ is real, and it bounds $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ above in $\mathbb{R}$, so $\sigma \le v$ by leastness of the real supremum. Hence $\sigma$ is the least upper bound of $A$. [step 1.3, step 2.3, L1, L2, L3]

3.2 In case I3 let $w$ be a lower bound of $A$ and fix $a \in A_{\mathbb{R}}$. From $w \le a$ with $a$ real we get $w \ne +\infty$. If $w = -\infty$ then $w \le \iota$; otherwise $w$ is real and bounds $A_{\mathbb{R}}$ below in $\mathbb{R}$, so $w \le \iota$. Hence $\iota$ is the greatest lower bound of $A$. [step 1.7, step 2.7, L1, L2, L4]

4.1 The four supremum cases are exhaustive and mutually exclusive: either $+\infty \in A$, which is S1, or not, and then either $A_{\mathbb{R}} = \emptyset$, which is S2, or $A_{\mathbb{R}} \ne \emptyset$ and it is bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$, which is S3, or it is not, which is S4. In each case a least upper bound was produced, and it is unique. The same four alternatives with $-\infty$, $+\infty$ and "below" in place of $+\infty$, $-\infty$ and "above" are I1 to I4, and in each a greatest lower bound was produced. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, step 2.4, step 2.5, step 2.6, step 3.2, step 2.8, L2, L5, cases: a two-fold split followed by a three-fold split, cases-exhaustive]

5.1 The agreement clause follows: a nonempty $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$ satisfies $+\infty \notin A$ and $A_{\mathbb{R}} = A$, so case S3 applies and $\sup A = \sup A_{\mathbb{R}}$ is the real supremum; a nonempty $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ bounded below satisfies case I3 and $\inf A$ is the real infimum; and $A = \emptyset$ falls under S2 and I2, giving $\sup \emptyset = -\infty$ and $\inf \emptyset = +\infty$. [step 2.3, step 3.1, step 2.7, step 3.2, step 4.1, L3, L4] ∎

## Remarks

- **What makes this work is that $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ has a top and a bottom.**
  The three defining clauses of the order ([[def-extended-reals]]) put $+\infty$
  above everything and $-\infty$ below everything, and every case above is settled
  by one of those two facts or by the least-upper-bound property of $\mathbb{R}$
  applied to the real part. Nothing else about $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is used,
  and in particular no arithmetic is used at all.

- **The two exceptional cases of [[fs-every-set-has-sup]] are not repaired, they
  are relocated.** That false statement records that in $\mathbb{R}$ a set may
  fail to have a supremum, and it stays true; the discipline of
  [[rem-sup-conventions]], which refuses to write $\sup S = +\infty$ inside
  $\mathbb{R}$, also stays in force. What is proved here is a statement about a
  different ordered set.

- **The empty set is not an exception here, and that is the point of the
  ambient set.** In $\mathbb{R}$ the empty set has no supremum, because every
  real is an upper bound and there is no least one.
  In $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ every element is still an upper bound of $\emptyset$,
  but now there *is* a least one, namely $-\infty$. The two statements are about
  different ordered sets and neither contradicts the other.

- **Where this is consumed.** [[def-limsup-liminf]] needs the supremum of a tail
  range of an arbitrary real sequence, which may be unbounded, and then the
  infimum of the resulting family, which may contain $+\infty$; both are supplied
  here and by nothing earlier in the library. Fourteen items on this page depend
  on it, and five more on the companion page of examples.

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]), with tail ranges $T_n$ and
extended tail bounds $s_n = \sup T_n$, $i_n = \inf T_n$ as in
[[def-limsup-liminf]].

1. **Monotonicity of the extended bounds under inclusion.** If
   $A \subseteq B \subseteq \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-extended-reals]]) then
   $$\sup A \le \sup B \qquad \text{and} \qquad \inf B \le \inf A,$$
   the four quantities being the extended bounds of [[lem-extended-reals-complete]].
   No hypothesis is placed on $A$ or $B$; in particular $A$ may be empty.
2. **The tail bounds are monotone.** $T_m \subseteq T_n$ whenever $n \le m$, and
   hence
   $$s_m \le s_n \qquad \text{and} \qquad i_n \le i_m \qquad (n \le m).$$
   In particular $s_{n+1} \le s_n$ and $i_n \le i_{n+1}$ for every $n$, and
   $i_n \le s_n$ for every $n$.
3. **Existence.** $\limsup_k x_k$ and $\liminf_k x_k$ exist in
   $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ for **every** sequence of reals, bounded or not.

Claim 1 is the tool the rest of this page uses whenever two extended suprema are
compared. It is proved here, from the definition of a least upper bound, rather
than quoted from the suprema page, for the reason given in the remarks below.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals, its tail ranges $T_n = \{x_k : k \ge n\}$, and the extended bounds $s_n = \sup T_n$, $i_n = \inf T_n$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-limsup-liminf]]).

[L1] Every subset of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ has a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, with no hypothesis on the subset ([[lem-extended-reals-complete]]).

[L2] Least upper bound and greatest lower bound in a poset: $\sup A$ is an upper bound of $A$ that is $\le$ every upper bound of $A$, and $\inf A$ is a lower bound that is $\ge$ every lower bound; each is unique when it exists ([[def-upper-bound]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L3] $(\overline{\mathbb{R}}, \le)$ is a totally ordered set, so its order is reflexive and transitive ([[def-extended-reals]], [[def-partial-order]]).

[L4] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total and transitive ([[def-nat-order]], [[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $A \subseteq B \subseteq \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ be arbitrary. By [L1] the four elements $\sup A$, $\sup B$, $\inf A$, $\inf B$ of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ all exist and are uniquely determined. [given, L1, L2]

1.2 Let $n \le m$ in $\mathbb{N}$. Every element of $T_m$ has the form $x_k$ with $k \ge m$, and then $k \ge n$ by transitivity, so $x_k \in T_n$; hence $T_m \subseteq T_n$. [given, L4]

1.3 For every $n$ the tail range $T_n$ contains $x_n$, so $i_n \le x_n$ because $i_n$ is a lower bound of $T_n$, and $x_n \le s_n$ because $s_n$ is an upper bound of $T_n$; transitivity gives $i_n \le s_n$. [given, L1, L2, L3]

2.1 Since $\sup B$ is an upper bound of $B$ and $A \subseteq B$, every element of $A$ is $\le \sup B$, so $\sup B$ is an upper bound of $A$; as $\sup A$ is the least of the upper bounds of $A$, this gives $\sup A \le \sup B$. Dually $\inf B$ is a lower bound of $B$, hence of $A$, and as $\inf A$ is the greatest of the lower bounds of $A$ this gives $\inf B \le \inf A$. Claim 1 is proved. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

3.1 Applying claim 1 to the inclusion $T_m \subseteq T_n$ valid for $n \le m$ gives $s_m \le s_n$ and $i_n \le i_m$; the special case $m = n + 1$ gives $s_{n+1} \le s_n$ and $i_n \le i_{n+1}$. Together with $i_n \le s_n$ this is claim 2. [step 1.2, step 1.3, step 2.1]

4.1 The families $\{s_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ and $\{i_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ are subsets of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, so [L1] applies to them with no hypothesis, and $\limsup_k x_k = \inf\{s_n\}$ and $\liminf_k x_k = \sup\{i_n\}$ exist in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ for every sequence of reals. This is claim 3. [step 3.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Remarks

- **The monotonicity is where the two operations of the definition interlock.**
  Because $(s_n)$ is nonincreasing, the outer infimum in
  $\limsup_k x_k = \inf_n s_n$ is an infimum of a decreasing family, so it is the
  value the tail suprema are pressing down towards; and because $(i_n)$ is
  nondecreasing, $\liminf_k x_k = \sup_n i_n$ is the value the tail infima are
  pressing up towards. Nothing in this lemma says the pressing converges, and for
  an unbounded sequence there is nothing in $\mathbb{R}$ for it to converge to;
  the exact statement is [[lem-limsup-epsilon-characterisation]].

- **Why the word "nonincreasing" is spelled out rather than cited.**
  [[def-monotone-sequence]] defines monotone for sequences of *reals*, and
  $(s_n)$ takes values in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, so the definition does not
  apply to it. Claim 2 is therefore stated as the inequality it is. When $(x_k)$
  is bounded every $s_n$ is real ([[def-limsup-liminf]]) and $(s_n)$ is then a
  nonincreasing sequence of reals in the sense of [[def-monotone-sequence]], but
  no proof on this page needs that reading.

- **Claim 1 is not [[lem-sup-monotone]].** That lemma is the same one-line
  argument carried out in $\mathbb{R}$, and its statement carries the hypotheses
  that the smaller set be nonempty and the larger one bounded above, without
  which neither supremum denotes anything. Those are exactly the hypotheses that
  the extended bounds of [[lem-extended-reals-complete]] dispense with, so the
  extended statement is not an instance of the real one and is proved from the
  definition of a least upper bound instead.

- **Claim 1 costs nothing and is used everywhere.** It is the one-line poset
  argument: the larger set's supremum bounds the smaller set, and leastness does
  the rest. It is stated as part of this lemma rather than as an item of its own
  because it is used only in company with the tail bounds.

## Statement

Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals. If the series $\sum a_k$ converges
([[def-series]]) then the sequence $(a_k)$ converges ([[def-real-limit]]), with

$$\lim_{k} a_k \;=\; 0 .$$

Equivalently, in the contrapositive form in which the lemma is almost always
used: **if $(a_k)$ does not converge to $0$ then $\sum a_k$ diverges.**

The same statement holds for a series $\sum_{k \ge m} a_k$ with a general
starting index, with the conclusion that $(a_{j+m})_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges
to $0$: that series is by definition the series of the sequence
$b_j = a_{j+m}$ ([[def-series]]), so it is the statement above applied to $(b_j)$.

The converse is false; it is refuted by [[fs-nth-term-test-converse]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(a_k)$ of reals whose series converges, with partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[A1] $(s_n)$ converges to some real $S$ ([[def-series]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L1] The recursion clause of the finite sum: $s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[def-series]]).

[L2] Convergence depends only on the tail: if $(x_n)$ converges to $x$ then so does its $1$-st tail $(x_{n+1})_{n}$ ([[lem-limit-of-tail]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L3] Algebra of limits: if $x_n \to x$ and $y_n \to y$ then $x_n - y_n \to x - y$ ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The sequence $(s_{n+1})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is the $1$-st tail of $(s_n)$, and it converges to $S$. [A1, L2]

1.2 From the recursion clause, $a_n = s_{n+1} - s_n$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. [L1, algebra]

2.1 Hence $(a_n)$ is the difference of two sequences converging to $S$, so it converges to $S - S = 0$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, A1, L3]

3.1 That is the claim, and its contrapositive is the assertion that a series whose terms do not tend to $0$ diverges. [step 2.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **This is a necessary condition and never a sufficient one.** It rules a series out; it never rules one in. The harmonic series has terms tending to $0$ and diverges, which is exactly the content of [[fs-nth-term-test-converse]].

- **What the proof actually uses.** Only that the partial sums converge and that consecutive partial sums differ by a term. No sign hypothesis is placed on $(a_k)$, and none is available at this point on the page.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$, with
$|x|$ the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]). Then

$$|x| \ge 0; \quad |x| = 0 \iff x = 0; \quad -|x| \le x \le |x|; \quad |-x| = |x|; \quad |xy| = |x|\,|y|;$$

and, for every $c > 0$, one has $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and elements $x, y \in F$.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| = u$ if $u \ge 0$, and $|u| = -u$ if $u < 0$ ([[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Ordered-field order: trichotomy holds (for each $u$ exactly one of $u > 0$, $u = 0$, $u < 0$), $a < b$ means $b - a$ is positive, and sums and products of positives are positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Signs in products: $(-a)b = -(ab)$ and $(-a)(-b) = ab$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] Sign rules: a product of two elements of the same sign is positive, and a product of two elements of opposite sign is negative ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Case $x > 0$: by [L1] $|x| = x > 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; since $-x < 0$ we get $|-x| = -(-x) = x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -x < 0 < x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case pos, L1, L2, algebra]

1.2 Case $x = 0$: then $|x| = |0| = 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ holds with $|x| = 0$ and $x = 0$, while $|-x| = |0| = |x|$ and $-|x| = 0 \le 0 \le 0 = |x|$. [assume-case zero, L1]

1.3 Case $x < 0$: by [L1] $|x| = -x$, and [L2] gives $-x > 0$, so $|x| > 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; here $|-x| = -x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -(-x) = x \le x$ while $x < 0 < -x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case neg, L1, L2, algebra]

1.4 Case $x = 0$ or $y = 0$: then $xy = 0$, so $|xy| = 0$, and one of $|x|, |y|$ is $0$, whence $|x|\,|y| = 0 = |xy|$. [assume-case zerofactor, L1]

1.5 Case $x, y$ have the same sign (both positive or both negative): by [L4] $xy > 0$, so $|xy| = xy$, while $|x|\,|y| = xy$ by [L3] (for $x, y < 0$ this is $(-x)(-y) = xy$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case same, L1, L3, L4]

1.6 Case $x, y$ have opposite signs (one positive, one negative): by [L4] $xy < 0$, so $|xy| = -(xy)$, while $|x|\,|y| = -(xy)$ by [L3] (namely $x(-y)$ or $(-x)y$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case opposite, L1, L3, L4]

2.1 By trichotomy [L2] each $x$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.1-1.3, and in each we verified $|x| \ge 0$, that $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$, that $|-x| = |x|$, and that $-|x| \le x \le |x|$; hence all four hold for every $x$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, cases-exhaustive]

2.2 By trichotomy [L2] each pair $x, y$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.4-1.6, and in each $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$ for all $x, y$. [step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6, cases-exhaustive]

3.1 Let $c > 0$: if $|x| < c$ then $-c < -|x| \le x \le |x| < c$ by [step 2.1] and [L2], so $-c < x < c$; conversely if $-c < x < c$ then both $x < c$ and $-x < c$, and since $|x|$ equals $x$ or $-x$ by [L1], we get $|x| < c$, so $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$. [step 2.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b \in F$.

1. If $a > 0$ then $a^{-1} > 0$.
2. If $0 < a < b$ then $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b \in F$.

[L1] $x > 0 \iff x \in P$; $x < 0 \iff -x \in P$; and for $x \neq 0$ exactly one of $x \in P$, $-x \in P$ holds ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Sign rules: a product of a positive and a negative is negative, a product of two positives is positive, and for $c > 0$ one has $a < b \iff ac < bc$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

[L3] $0 < 1$; in particular $1 \neq 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L4] $P$ is closed under addition, so $<$ is transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a > 0$, so $a \neq 0$ and its inverse $a^{-1}$ exists with $a \cdot a^{-1} = 1$; moreover $a^{-1} \neq 0$, since $a^{-1}$ has $a$ as its inverse while $0$ is non-invertible ($1 \neq 0$ by L3). [assume-hyp, L1, L3]

2.1 By trichotomy $a^{-1} \in P$ or $-a^{-1} \in P$; if $-a^{-1} \in P$, then $a > 0$ and $a^{-1} < 0$ give $a \cdot a^{-1} < 0$ by the sign rules, i.e. $1 < 0$, contradicting $0 < 1$; hence $a^{-1} \in P$, i.e. $a^{-1} > 0$, proving claim 1. [step 1.1, L2, L3, L1]

3.1 Assume $0 < a < b$; then $0 < b$ by transitivity, so by claim 1 both $a^{-1} > 0$ and $b^{-1} > 0$, and the sign rules give $a^{-1} b^{-1} > 0$. [assume-hyp, step 2.1, L4, L2, L1]

4.1 Multiplying $a < b$ by the positive $a^{-1} b^{-1}$ via the sign rules gives $a (a^{-1} b^{-1}) < b (a^{-1} b^{-1})$; since $a a^{-1} = 1$ and $b b^{-1} = 1$, this simplifies to $b^{-1} < a^{-1}$. [step 3.1, L2, algebra]

5.1 Together with $b^{-1} > 0$ from step 3.1, we conclude $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$, proving claim 2. [step 3.1, step 4.1] ∎

and define **Kummer's expression**

$$K_k \;:=\; \zeta_k \frac{a_k}{a_{k+1}} \;-\; \zeta_{k+1} \qquad (k \in \mathbb{N}),$$

a sequence of reals whose limit inferior exists in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$
([[lem-limsup-exists]]). Then:

1. if $\liminf_{k} K_k > 0$ then $\sum a_k$ converges;
2. if $\sum 1/\zeta_k$ diverges and $K_k \le 0$ for all $k$ from some index on,
   then $\sum a_k$ diverges.

**Positivity of $(a_k)$ is load bearing and is not a normalisation.** Claim 2 is
FALSE for terms of mixed sign, and the failure is not delicate: see the first
remark below, where a convergent geometric series with negative ratio satisfies
every hypothesis of claim 2 with the weights $\zeta_k = 1$.

The two claims specialise to the ratio test at $\zeta_k = 1$ and to Raabe's test
at $\zeta_k = k+1$; those two corollaries follow immediately below, and they are
the only ways this theorem is used on this page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $(a_k)$, $(\zeta_k)$ of reals with $a_k > 0$ and $\zeta_k > 0$ for every $k$; Kummer's expression $K_k = \zeta_k a_k/a_{k+1} - \zeta_{k+1}$; the auxiliary sequence $b_k := \zeta_k a_k$, which is positive; and the tail infima $i_n = \inf\{K_k : k \ge n\}$ taken in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, so that $\liminf_k K_k = \sup\{i_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ ([[def-limsup-liminf]], [[def-extended-reals]]).

[L1] Every subset of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ has a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound there ([[lem-extended-reals-complete]]). In particular a real $u$ below $\sup\{i_n\}$ is not an upper bound of $\{i_n\}$; $i_n$ is a lower bound of $\{K_k : k \ge n\}$; and $i_n \le K_n$, so $i_n$ is not $+\infty$.

[L2] Both limit quantities exist for every sequence ([[lem-limsup-exists]], [[def-limsup-liminf]]).

[L3] A nonincreasing sequence bounded below converges ([[thm-monotone-convergence]], [[def-monotone-sequence]], [[def-bounded-set]]); consecutive comparisons suffice to establish monotonicity ([[def-monotone-sequence]]).

[L4] $\sum (x_k - x_{k+1})$ converges whenever $(x_k)$ converges ([[lem-telescoping-series]]).

[L5] Direct comparison: if $0 \le x_k \le y_k$ from some index on and $\sum y_k$ converges then $\sum x_k$ converges ([[thm-direct-comparison-test]]).

[L6] For $c \ne 0$, $\sum c\,x_k$ converges if and only if $\sum x_k$ converges ([[lem-series-linearity]]); and a series converges if and only if each of its tail series converges ([[lem-series-tail-invariance]], [[def-series]]).

[L7] The principle of induction ([[thm-induction-principle]]); and $1/x > 0$ for $x > 0$, with $x \le y$ implying $1/y \le 1/x$ for positive $x, y$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Suppose $\liminf_k K_k > 0$. The real $0$ is then not an upper bound of $\{i_n\}$, so there is $N \in \mathbb{N}$ with $i_N > 0$. [given, L1, L2, choose]

1.2 Suppose now that $\sum 1/\zeta_k$ diverges and that there is $N$ with $K_k \le 0$ for every $k \ge N$. [given]

2.1 Since $i_N \le K_N$ and $i_N > 0$, the value $i_N$ is a real number; put $c := i_N > 0$, so that $K_k \ge c$ for every $k \ge N$. [step 1.1, L1]

2.2 Multiplying $K_k \le 0$ by $a_{k+1} > 0$ gives $\zeta_k a_k \le \zeta_{k+1} a_{k+1}$, that is $b_k \le b_{k+1}$, for every $k \ge N$. [step 1.2, given, algebra]

3.1 Multiplying $K_k \ge c$ by $a_{k+1} > 0$ gives $\zeta_k a_k - \zeta_{k+1} a_{k+1} \ge c\,a_{k+1}$, that is $b_k - b_{k+1} \ge c\,a_{k+1} > 0$, for every $k \ge N$. [step 2.1, given, algebra]

3.2 An induction on $j$ gives $b_{N+j} \ge b_N$ for every $j \in \mathbb{N}$: at $j = 0$ it is an equality, and if it holds at $j$ then $b_{N+j+1} \ge b_{N+j} \ge b_N$. [step 2.2, L7]

4.1 Hence $b_{N+j} \ge b_{N+j+1}$ for every $j \in \mathbb{N}$, so the tail sequence $(b_{N+j})_{j}$ is nonincreasing; and it is bounded below by $0$, every $b_k$ being positive. [step 3.1, given, L3]

4.2 So $\zeta_m a_m \ge b_N > 0$ for every $m \ge N$, and dividing by $\zeta_m > 0$ gives $a_m \ge b_N \cdot (1/\zeta_m) > 0$. [step 3.2, given, L7]

5.1 Therefore $(b_{N+j})_{j}$ converges, and by the telescoping lemma $\sum_{j} \big(b_{N+j} - b_{N+j+1}\big)$ converges. [step 4.1, L3, L4]

5.2 Since $\sum 1/\zeta_k$ diverges and $b_N \ne 0$, the series $\sum b_N (1/\zeta_k)$ diverges. [step 1.2, step 4.2, L6]

6.1 By step 3.1 we have $0 \le c\,a_{N+j+1} \le b_{N+j} - b_{N+j+1}$ for every $j$, so $\sum_{j} c\,a_{N+j+1}$ converges by comparison, and since $c \ne 0$ so does $\sum_{j} a_{N+j+1}$. [step 3.1, step 5.1, L5, L6]

7.1 That last series is the $(N+1)$-th tail series of $\sum a_k$, so $\sum a_k$ converges, which is claim 1. [step 6.1, L6]

8.1 If $\sum a_k$ converged then, since $0 \le b_N(1/\zeta_m) \le a_m$ for $m \ge N$, comparison would make $\sum b_N(1/\zeta_k)$ converge, contradicting step 5.2; so $\sum a_k$ diverges, which is claim 2. [step 4.2, step 5.2, L5] ∎

## Remarks

- **Claim 2 fails for terms of mixed sign, and here is the witness.** Take $\zeta_k = 1$ for every $k$ and $a_k = (-1/2)^{k}$. Then $a_k / a_{k+1} = 1/(-1/2) = -2$ ([[lem-power-laws]], [[def-integer-power]]), so $K_k = -2 - 1 = -3 \le 0$ at every index; and $\sum 1/\zeta_k = \sum 1$ diverges, its terms not tending to $0$ ([[lem-nth-term-test]]). Both hypotheses of claim 2 hold. Yet $\sum (-1/2)^{k}$ converges, with sum $2/3$, since $|-1/2| < 1$ ([[thm-geometric-series]]). The conclusion therefore fails, and what fails with it is exactly step 2.2, which multiplied an inequality by $a_{k+1}$ and needed that factor to be positive. The classical signed witness at $\zeta_k = 1$ is $a_k = (-1)^{k}/k$, whose hypotheses check the same way; its convergence is the alternating series test, which this page does not prove, and that is why the geometric witness is the one used here.

- **The weights are a free parameter, and that is the point of the theorem.** Kummer's test is not a single criterion but a family of them, one for each positive sequence $(\zeta_k)$, and the strength of the resulting test is exactly the strength of the divergent comparison series $\sum 1/\zeta_k$ it carries. Constant weights give the ratio test, weights $k+1$ give Raabe's test, and the pattern continues past what this page can state, since the next natural choice needs the logarithm.

- **Claim 1 does not need $\sum 1/\zeta_k$ to diverge.** The convergence half uses only positivity of the weights, through the telescoping bound in step 5.1. The divergence half is where the weights have to be tied to a known divergent series, and that asymmetry is why the two halves are not mirror images.

## Statement

Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals with $a_k \ne 0$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$
and put

$$q_k \;:=\; \Big|\frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k}\Big| \;=\; \frac{|a_{k+1}|}{|a_k|} \qquad (k \in \mathbb{N}),$$

a genuine sequence on $\mathbb{N}$, whose limit superior and limit inferior exist
in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ for every such $(a_k)$ ([[lem-limsup-exists]]). Then:

1. if $\limsup_{k} q_k < 1$ then $\sum |a_k|$ converges, and hence $\sum a_k$
   converges as well ([[lem-absolute-convergence-implies-convergence]]);
2. if $\liminf_{k} q_k > 1$ then $\sum a_k$ diverges.

The hypothesis $a_k \ne 0$ is what makes $q_k$ exist and is not a convenience: a
single vanishing term leaves the ratio at that index undefined. For a family from
a starting index $m$ the statement is the one above applied to the shifted
sequence $j \mapsto a_{j+m}$ ([[def-series]]), whose ratios are
$|a_{j+m+1}/a_{j+m}|$.

**Nothing is claimed when $\limsup_k q_k \ge 1 \ge \liminf_k q_k$.** In that
regime the test is silent, and it has to be: the companion page carries a
convergent series whose ratios have limit superior $2$, and both a convergent and
a divergent series with ratio limit exactly $1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(a_k)$ of reals with $a_k \ne 0$ for every $k$; the ratios $q_k = |a_{k+1}|/|a_k|$; the tail bounds $s_n = \sup\{q_k : k \ge n\}$ and $i_n = \inf\{q_k : k \ge n\}$ taken in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, so that $\limsup_k q_k = \inf\{s_n\}$ and $\liminf_k q_k = \sup\{i_n\}$ ([[def-limsup-liminf]], [[def-extended-reals]]); and the assumption that one of the two hypotheses of the Statement holds.

[L1] Every subset of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ has a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound there, and the extended order is total ([[lem-extended-reals-complete]]). In particular $\inf\{s_n\} \le s_n$ and $\sup\{i_n\} \ge i_n$ for every $n$; $q_k \le s_n$ and $q_k \ge i_n$ for every $k \ge n$; a real $t$ exceeding $\inf\{s_n\}$ is not a lower bound of $\{s_n\}$; and a real $u$ below $\sup\{i_n\}$ is not an upper bound of $\{i_n\}$.

[L2] Both quantities exist for every sequence ([[lem-limsup-exists]], [[def-limsup-liminf]]).

[L3] Absolute value: $|x| \ge 0$; $|x| = 0$ exactly when $x = 0$; $|xy| = |x||y|$, so $|a_{k+1}/a_k| = |a_{k+1}|/|a_k|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L4] The principle of induction ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L5] The geometric series $\sum_{j \ge 0} t^{j}$ converges when $|t| < 1$; a series converges if and only if each of its tail series converges; and $\sum c\,x_j$ converges when $\sum x_j$ does ([[thm-geometric-series]], [[lem-series-tail-invariance]], [[lem-series-linearity]]).

[L6] Direct comparison: if $0 \le x_j \le y_j$ from some index on and $\sum y_j$ converges then $\sum x_j$ converges ([[thm-direct-comparison-test]]).

[L7] If a series converges then its terms tend to $0$ ([[lem-nth-term-test]], [[def-real-limit]]); and for every real $c > 0$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with the rational $1/n < c$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]]).

[L8] Powers: $t^{0} = 1$, $t^{j+1} = t^{j} t$, and $t^{j} > 0$ for $t > 0$ ([[def-integer-power]], [[lem-power-monotone]]).

[L9] If $\sum |x_k|$ converges then $\sum x_k$ converges ([[lem-absolute-convergence-implies-convergence]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Assume $\limsup_{k} q_k < 1$. [assume-case lt]

1.2 Assume instead $\liminf_{k} q_k > 1$. [assume-case gt]

1.3 Each $q_k$ is a nonnegative real, being a quotient of a nonnegative real by a positive one, so every $s_n \ge q_n \ge 0$ and hence $\limsup_k q_k \ge 0$. [given, L1, L2, L3]

2.1 In the case $\limsup_k q_k < 1$ the value $\Lambda := \limsup_k q_k$ therefore lies strictly between the reals $0$ and $1$ inclusive of $0$, so it is a real number; put $t := (\Lambda + 1)/2$, a real with $0 \le \Lambda < t < 1$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, L1, choose]

2.2 In the case $\liminf_k q_k > 1$, the real $1$ is not an upper bound of $\{i_n\}$, so there is $N \in \mathbb{N}$ with $i_N > 1$. [step 1.2, L1, choose]

3.1 In the case $\Lambda < 1$: since $t > \Lambda = \inf\{s_n\}$, the real $t$ is not a lower bound of $\{s_n\}$, so there is $N$ with $s_N < t$, and then $q_k \le s_N < t$ for every $k \ge N$. [step 2.1, L1, choose]

3.2 In the case $\liminf_k q_k > 1$: $q_k \ge i_N > 1$ for every $k \ge N$, since $i_N$ is a lower bound of $\{q_k : k \ge N\}$. [step 2.2, L1]

3.3 In the case $\Lambda < 1$: the series $\sum_{j \ge 0} t^{\,j}$ converges since $|t| = t < 1$, hence so does $\sum_{j \ge 0} |a_N| t^{\,j}$. [step 2.1, L5]

4.1 In the case $\Lambda < 1$: for $k \ge N$, $|a_{k+1}|/|a_k| < t$ with $|a_k| > 0$, hence $|a_{k+1}| < t\,|a_k|$. [step 3.1, L3, algebra]

4.2 In the case $\liminf_k q_k > 1$: for $k \ge N$, $|a_{k+1}| > |a_k|$, again multiplying by $|a_k| > 0$. [step 3.2, L3, algebra]

5.1 In the case $\Lambda < 1$: an induction on $j$ gives $|a_{N+j}| \le |a_N|\,t^{\,j}$ for every $j \in \mathbb{N}$. At $j = 0$ this is an equality, since $t^{0} = 1$; and if it holds at $j$ then $|a_{N+j+1}| < t\,|a_{N+j}| \le t\,|a_N| t^{\,j} = |a_N| t^{\,j+1}$, using $t > 0$. [step 4.1, L4, L8]

5.2 In the case $\liminf_k q_k > 1$: an induction on $j$ gives $|a_{N+j}| \ge |a_N| > 0$ for every $j \in \mathbb{N}$. At $j = 0$ it is an equality, and if it holds at $j$ then $|a_{N+j+1}| > |a_{N+j}| \ge |a_N|$. [step 4.2, L3, L4]

6.1 In the case $\Lambda < 1$: with $x_j := |a_{N+j}|$ and $y_j := |a_N| t^{\,j}$ we have $0 \le x_j \le y_j$ for every $j$, so $\sum_j |a_{N+j}|$ converges; that is the $N$-th tail series of $\sum |a_k|$, so $\sum |a_k|$ converges. [step 5.1, step 3.3, L3, L5, L6]

6.2 In the case $\liminf_k q_k > 1$: $(a_k)$ does not converge to $0$. Choose a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < |a_N|$; if $a_k \to 0$ there would be $K$ with $|a_k| < 1/n$ for all $k \ge K$, contradicting $|a_k| \ge |a_N| > 1/n$ at any index $k$ that is at least both $K$ and $N$. [step 5.2, L7, choose]

7.1 In the case $\liminf_k q_k > 1$: by the term test $\sum a_k$ diverges, which is claim 2. [step 6.2, L7]

7.2 In the case $\Lambda < 1$: the series $\sum |a_k|$ having been shown to converge, $\sum a_k$ converges as well; together with the convergence of $\sum |a_k|$ that is claim 1. [step 6.1, L9]

8.1 The two assumed hypotheses are the cases of the disjunction in the Given, and they exhaust it; outside them both claims are vacuous, each hypothesis being false, so the theorem holds for every sequence with nonvanishing terms. [step 7.2, step 7.1, cases-exhaustive] ∎

## Remarks

- **The two halves are not dual, and the asymmetry is real.** Convergence needs the ratios to be *eventually* below a fixed $t < 1$, which $\limsup < 1$ supplies; divergence needs them *eventually* above $1$, which is what $\liminf > 1$ supplies. A hypothesis on $\limsup$ alone can never force divergence, since a single large ratio occurring arbitrarily late says nothing about the size of the terms. That is exactly what [[fs-ratio-limsup-at-least-one-diverges]] records.

- **The geometric series is the only convergent series the proof knows.** Claim 1 is a comparison against $|a_N| t^{j}$, and every later refinement on this page, Kummer's test included, exists because that comparison is too coarse when the ratios approach $1$.
