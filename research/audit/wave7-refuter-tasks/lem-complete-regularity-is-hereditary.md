## Statement

Complete regularity, with no $T_1$ condition built into its name, is hereditary.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A completely regular space $X$, a subspace $S\subseteq X$, a closed set $F$ of $S$, and $x\in S\setminus F$.

[F1] A closed subset of $S$ has the form $C\cap S$ for a closed $C\subseteq X$ ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]).

[F2] Complete regularity supplies a continuous $f:X\to[0,1]$ with $f(x)=1$ and $f[C]=\{0\}$ when $C$ is closed and misses $x$ ([[def-completely-regular-and-tychonoff-spaces]]).

[L1] A restriction of a continuous map to a subspace is continuous ([[def-subspace-topology-top]], [[thm-continuity-characterisations-top]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Choose closed $C\subseteq X$ with $F=C\cap S$; since $x\in S\setminus F$, one has $x\notin C$. [F1]

1.2 Choose $f:X\to[0,1]$ continuous with $f(x)=1$ and $f[C]=\{0\}$. [F2]

2.1 The restriction $f|_S:S\to[0,1]$ is continuous, takes $x$ to $1$, and vanishes on $F\subseteq C$. [L1, step 1.2]

3.1 Thus $S$ is completely regular, and the arbitrariness of $S$ proves heredity. [F2, step 2.1] ∎

## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]) and let
$[0,1] \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ carry the subspace topology of the usual topology of
$\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-interval]], [[def-subspace-topology-top]],
[[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]], [[def-metrizable-space]]).

- $X$ is **completely regular** when a point can be separated from a closed set
  not containing it *by a continuous function*: for every closed $C \subseteq X$
  and every $x_0 \in X \setminus C$ there is a continuous
  $f : X \to [0,1]$ ([[def-continuous-map-top]]) with
  $$f(x_0) = 1 \qquad \text{and} \qquad f(y) = 0 \ \text{ for every } y \in C .$$
- $X$ is **Tychonoff**, also written **$T_{3\frac{1}{2}}$** and *completely
  regular Hausdorff*, when it is completely regular **and** $T_1$
  ([[def-t0-and-t1-spaces]]).

The case $C = \varnothing$ is allowed and is satisfied by the constant function
$1$, which is continuous ([[def-zero-sets-and-cozero-sets]]); so the condition
hides no nonemptiness hypothesis.

**The same condition in the vocabulary of zero sets.** With $f$ as displayed,
$C \subseteq Z(f)$ and $x_0 \in \operatorname{coz}(f)$
([[def-zero-sets-and-cozero-sets]]), so complete regularity says: for every
closed $C$ and every $x_0 \notin C$ there is a continuous $f$ whose zero set
contains $C$ and whose cozero set contains $x_0$. In particular
$\operatorname{coz}(f)$ is an open set containing $x_0$ and disjoint from $C$;
that alone is weaker than regularity, and the passage from the function to two
*disjoint* open sets is the next item.

**The values $0$ and $1$ are a normalisation, not a restriction.** If
$g : X \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous with $g(x_0) = a$, $g[C] = \{b\}$ and
$a \ne b$, then the condition above is met by a function built from $g$ by an
affine change of variable followed by truncation into $[0,1]$; this page never
needs that construction, because every function it builds is already normalised.
The *direction* of the normalisation is a genuine convention and is fixed here as
$f(x_0) = 1$ and $f[C] = \{0\}$, following the most common usage; some texts
write the reverse, and a reader must check which is meant before quoting a
formula.

**The convention fork over $T_1$ is the same one as for regularity.** *Completely
regular* names the function-separation condition alone, and Tychonoff names the
conjunction with $T_1$ ([[def-regular-and-t3-spaces]]). The indiscrete topology
on a two-point set ([[def-standard-topologies]]) is completely regular, its only
closed set disjoint from a point being $\varnothing$, and it is not $T_0$; so the
two halves are independent here as well.

## Remarks

- **Complete regularity is a strong hypothesis in disguise.** It asserts the
  existence of many continuous real-valued functions, and a space may have almost
  none; producing such functions is what Urysohn's lemma does for normal $T_1$
  spaces, and that lemma is not available at this point in the reading order
  ([[rem-separation-axiom-conventions]]).

- **Why the numeral is $3\frac12$.** Complete regularity implies regularity, as
  the next item proves, and every normal $T_1$ space is completely regular, which
  this page does **not** prove; so the axiom sits between $T_3$ and $T_4$, and
  the fractional numeral records that position and nothing more.

- **Both names are in use for the conjunction.** *Tychonoff*, *completely regular
  Hausdorff* and *$T_{3\frac12}$* denote the same class; this library writes
  Tychonoff.

## Definition

A **property of topological spaces** is a condition $P$ that is either true or
false of each space, as in [[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]; a **topological
property** is one whose truth value is the same for homeomorphic spaces. Every
subset of a space is regarded as a space by giving it the subspace topology
([[def-subspace-topology-top]]).

Let $P$ be a property of topological spaces. Then $P$ is

- **hereditary** if, whenever a space $X$ has $P$, every subspace of $X$ has $P$;
- **open-hereditary** if, whenever $X$ has $P$, every subspace $S \subseteq X$
  with $S$ open in $X$ has $P$;
- **closed-hereditary** if, whenever $X$ has $P$, every subspace $S \subseteq X$
  with $S$ closed in $X$ has $P$.

A hereditary property is both open-hereditary and closed-hereditary, since the
condition on $S$ is only a restriction of the range of subspaces quantified over.
Neither of the two weaker notions implies the other, and neither implies
heredity.

**The definition is stable under the route by which a subspace is reached.** If
$S \subseteq T \subseteq X$ then the topology $S$ inherits from the subspace $T$
is the topology $S$ inherits from $X$, transitivity being discharged in
[[def-subspace-topology-top]]. So "every subspace of $X$" is unambiguous, and a
hereditary property automatically passes from $X$ to a subspace of a subspace,
with no separate induction.

**Heredity is a statement about a property, not about a space.** It quantifies
over all spaces having $P$ and all their subspaces, so a single space whose
subspaces all inherit $P$ says nothing; and a single space that **has** $P$ and
has one subspace lacking $P$ refutes heredity outright. A space that lacks $P$
refutes nothing, however its subspaces behave. That asymmetry is why the failures are
recorded here as counterexamples and the successes as theorems.

**Only topological properties are worth asking about.** Taking $S = X$ shows that
a hereditary property holds of $X$ itself, and the subspace topology on $X$ is
$\mathcal{T}$ ([[def-subspace-topology-top]], with $U \cap X = U$), so the
definition is not vacuous at the top. But a condition that is not invariant under
homeomorphism can be hereditary for uninteresting reasons, since a subspace is
only determined up to the identification of its topology
([[def-topological-space]]); every property named hereditary in this library is
a topological property, and it is said so where it is proved.

## Remarks

- **The three notions separate in practice.** Metrizability and first
  countability are hereditary, and that is proved in the next item. "Has a
  countable dense subset" is open-hereditary, by claim 4 of
  [[thm-subspace-closure-and-interior]], and is *not* hereditary; the witness is
  worked on the companion page, where an uncountable discrete subspace is
  exhibited inside a space that has a countable dense subset.

- **What is deliberately not settled here.** Whether the separation properties
  beyond the Hausdorff condition of [[def-hausdorff-space]] are hereditary is a
  question about axioms that are not available at this point in the reading
  order, and no claim about them is made on this page.

- **Products have their own word.** A property preserved by arbitrary products is
  usually called *productive*, and the same three-way refinement (finite
  products, countable products, arbitrary products) applies to it. No item on
  this page uses that word, because the productive theorems it would organise are
  not available at this point in the reading order.

## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]) and let
$S \subseteq X$. The **subspace topology** (also *relative topology*) on $S$ is

$$\mathcal{T}_S := \{\, U \cap S : U \in \mathcal{T} \,\},$$

the family of **traces** on $S$ of the open sets of $X$. The pair
$(S, \mathcal{T}_S)$ is a **subspace** of $X$. A subset of $S$ that lies in
$\mathcal{T}_S$ is said to be **open in $S$**, and *relatively open* where the
ambient space needs emphasis.

**$\mathcal{T}_S$ is a topology, and this is discharged here.** (T1):
$\varnothing = \varnothing \cap S$ and $S = X \cap S$ are traces. (T2): if
$\mathcal{S}' \subseteq \mathcal{T}_S$, choose for each member a set of
$\mathcal{T}$ tracing to it — no choice principle is needed, since
$U' := \bigcup \{\, U \in \mathcal{T} : U \cap S \subseteq W \,\}$ is a canonical
such set for $W \in \mathcal{T}_S$, being open by (T2) in $X$ and satisfying
$U' \cap S = W$ — and then
$\bigcup_i (U_i \cap S) = (\bigcup_i U_i) \cap S \in \mathcal{T}_S$ by (T2) in
$X$. (T3): $(U \cap S) \cap (V \cap S) = (U \cap V) \cap S \in \mathcal{T}_S$ by
(T3) in $X$.

**Closed sets of a subspace are the traces of the closed sets.** A set
$C \subseteq S$ is closed in $S$ if and only if $C = F \cap S$ for some closed
$F \subseteq X$. Indeed $S \setminus (U \cap S) = (X \setminus U) \cap S$ and
$S \setminus (F \cap S) = (X \setminus F) \cap S$, so complementation inside $S$
matches complementation inside $X$ under tracing.

**Bases and subbases trace as well.** If $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for
$\mathcal{T}$ ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]) then
$\mathcal{B}_S := \{\, B \cap S : B \in \mathcal{B} \,\}$ is a basis for
$\mathcal{T}_S$: its members are open in $S$, and for $W = U \cap S$ open in $S$
and $x \in W$ there is $B \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B \subseteq U$, whence
$x \in B \cap S \subseteq W$. The same computation with a subbasis $\mathcal{S}$
shows that $\{\, S_0 \cap S : S_0 \in \mathcal{S} \,\}$ is a subbasis for
$\mathcal{T}_S$, since tracing commutes with finite intersections and with
unions.

**The inclusion is continuous.** The inclusion map $\iota : S \to X$,
$\iota(s) = s$, satisfies $\iota^{-1}[U] = U \cap S$ for every $U \subseteq X$,
so preimages of open sets are open and $\iota$ is continuous
([[thm-continuity-characterisations-top]], clause (b)). Moreover
$\mathcal{T}_S$ is the **coarsest** topology on $S$ making $\iota$ continuous: any
topology on $S$ for which $\iota$ is continuous must contain every
$\iota^{-1}[U] = U \cap S$, hence contain $\mathcal{T}_S$.

**Characteristic property of a map into a subspace.** Let $(Z, \mathcal{T}_Z)$ be
a topological space and let $g : Z \to S$ be a function. Then

$$g \text{ is continuous as a map } Z \to (S,\mathcal{T}_S) \iff \iota \circ g \text{ is continuous as a map } Z \to (X,\mathcal{T}) .$$

*Proof.* For $U \in \mathcal{T}$ one has
$(\iota \circ g)^{-1}[U] = g^{-1}[\iota^{-1}[U]] = g^{-1}[U \cap S]$. If $g$ is
continuous then each $g^{-1}[U \cap S]$ is open, so $\iota \circ g$ is continuous;
conversely if $\iota \circ g$ is continuous then for any $W = U \cap S$ open in
$S$ the set $g^{-1}[W] = (\iota \circ g)^{-1}[U]$ is open, so $g$ is continuous.
Both directions use only clause (b) of [[thm-continuity-characterisations-top]].

**Restriction of a continuous map.** If $f : X \to Y$ is continuous and
$S \subseteq X$, then $f|_S : S \to Y$ is continuous, since
$(f|_S)^{-1}[V] = f^{-1}[V] \cap S$ is open in $S$ for every open $V \subseteq Y$
([[def-continuous-map-top]], [[thm-continuity-characterisations-top]]).

**When relative and ambient agree.** If $S$ is open in $X$ then a subset of $S$
is open in $S$ if and only if it is open in $X$: a trace $U \cap S$ is then an
intersection of two open sets of $X$, and conversely an open subset of $X$
contained in $S$ is its own trace. The same statement with "closed" throughout
holds when $S$ is closed in $X$. Both are used in the pasting lemma of the next
item, and both fail without the hypothesis: $S$ itself is always open and closed
in $S$, and need be neither in $X$.

## Remarks

- **The subspace topology is what makes a subset a space.** Before it, a statement
  such as "the restriction of $f$ to $C$ is continuous" has no meaning, because
  $C$ carries no topology. Every restriction below is taken with respect to the
  subspace topology and with no other convention available.

- **Openness and closedness are not absolute.** $[0,1)$ is open in $[0,2)$ and is
  neither open nor closed in $\mathbb{R}$; the interval $(0,1)$ is closed in
  itself. A sentence of the form "$A$ is open" is incomplete unless the space is
  named, and this library names it whenever more than one is in play.

- **Transitivity.** If $S \subseteq T \subseteq X$ then the subspace topology $S$
  inherits from $(T, \mathcal{T}_T)$ is the subspace topology it inherits from
  $X$, since $(U \cap T) \cap S = U \cap S$ for $U \in \mathcal{T}$. So no
  ambiguity arises from the route by which a subset is reached.

## Statement

Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be topological spaces, let
$f : X \to Y$ be a function, and let $\mathcal{S}$ be a subbasis for
$\mathcal{T}_Y$ ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]). The following five conditions
are equivalent.

- **(a)** $f$ is continuous at every point of $X$ ([[def-continuous-map-top]]).
- **(b)** $f^{-1}[V]$ is open in $X$ for every open $V \subseteq Y$.
- **(c)** $f^{-1}[F]$ is closed in $X$ for every closed $F \subseteq Y$.
- **(d)** $f^{-1}[S]$ is open in $X$ for every $S \in \mathcal{S}$.
- **(e)** $f[\overline{A}] \subseteq \overline{f[A]}$ for every $A \subseteq X$,
  closures being taken in $X$ and in $Y$ respectively
  ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

Condition (d) is what makes continuity checkable against a generating family
rather than against every open set, and it holds for a *basis* as well, a basis
being in particular a subbasis for the topology it generates.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Topological spaces $(X,\mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y,\mathcal{T}_Y)$, a function $f : X \to Y$, a subbasis $\mathcal{S}$ for $\mathcal{T}_Y$, subsets $A \subseteq X$ and $V, F \subseteq Y$. Preimages satisfy $f^{-1}[Y \setminus W] = X \setminus f^{-1}[W]$, $f^{-1}[\bigcup_i W_i] = \bigcup_i f^{-1}[W_i]$ and $f^{-1}[\bigcap_i W_i] = \bigcap_i f^{-1}[W_i]$ for every family, with $f^{-1}[Y] = X$ for the empty intersection.

[A1] $f$ is continuous at $x$ when for every open $V \ni f(x)$ there is an open $U \ni x$ with $f[U] \subseteq V$ ([[def-continuous-map-top]]).

[A2] A set is closed exactly when its complement is open; a set is open exactly when it is a union of open sets containing each of its points ([[def-topological-space]]).

[L1] The topology generated by $\mathcal{S}$ has as a basis the family $\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S}}$ of intersections of finitely many members of $\mathcal{S}$, the empty intersection being $Y$; every open set is a union of members of $\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S}}$ ([[thm-basis-criterion]], [[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]).

[L2] $x \in \overline{A}$ if and only if every open set containing $x$ meets $A$ ([[thm-closure-characterisation-top]], clause (c)).

[L3] $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed superset of $A$, and $A$ is closed exactly when $A = \overline{A}$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 (a) implies (b): let $V \subseteq Y$ be open and let $x \in f^{-1}[V]$, so $f(x) \in V$; continuity at $x$ gives an open $U \ni x$ with $f[U] \subseteq V$, that is $U \subseteq f^{-1}[V]$. As $x$ was arbitrary, $f^{-1}[V]$ is a union of open sets, hence open. [A1, A2]

1.2 (b) implies (a): let $x \in X$ and let $V$ be open with $f(x) \in V$; then $U := f^{-1}[V]$ is open, contains $x$, and satisfies $f[U] \subseteq V$. [A1]

1.3 (b) and (c) are equivalent: $F \subseteq Y$ is closed exactly when $Y \setminus F$ is open, and $f^{-1}[Y \setminus F] = X \setminus f^{-1}[F]$, so $f^{-1}[F]$ is closed exactly when $f^{-1}[Y \setminus F]$ is open; as $F$ ranges over the closed sets, $Y \setminus F$ ranges over the open sets. [given, A2]

1.4 (b) implies (d): every $S \in \mathcal{S}$ is open, $\mathcal{S}$ being contained in the topology it generates. [L1]

1.5 (d) implies (b): let $V \subseteq Y$ be open; by [L1] $V$ is a union of sets of the form $S_1 \cap \dots \cap S_n$ with $n \ge 0$ and $S_i \in \mathcal{S}$, and $f^{-1}$ turns unions into unions and intersections into intersections, with $f^{-1}[Y] = X$ for $n = 0$; so $f^{-1}[V]$ is a union of finite intersections of the open sets $f^{-1}[S_i]$ together with $X$, hence open. [given, L1, A2]

1.6 (e) implies (c): let $F \subseteq Y$ be closed and put $A := f^{-1}[F]$; then $f[A] \subseteq F$, so $f[\overline{A}] \subseteq \overline{f[A]} \subseteq \overline{F} = F$ by (e), monotonicity of the closure and [L3]; hence $\overline{A} \subseteq f^{-1}[F] = A$, and with $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ this gives $A = \overline{A}$, so $A$ is closed. [L3]

2.1 (b) implies (e): let $A \subseteq X$ and $x \in \overline{A}$, and let $V$ be open with $f(x) \in V$; then $f^{-1}[V]$ is open and contains $x$, so it meets $A$ by [L2], say at $a$; then $f(a) \in V \cap f[A]$, so $V$ meets $f[A]$. As $V$ was arbitrary, $f(x) \in \overline{f[A]}$ by [L2]. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 Steps 1.1 and 1.2 make (a) and (b) equivalent; step 1.3 makes (b) and (c) equivalent; steps 1.4 and 1.5 make (b) and (d) equivalent; step 2.1 gives (b) implies (e) and step 1.6 gives (e) implies (c), which closes the cycle through (c) and (b). Hence all five conditions are equivalent. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, step 1.4, step 1.5, step 2.1, step 1.6] ∎

## Remarks

- **Only (a) is pointwise.** Conditions (b) to (e) are global, and none of them has a pointwise version that is equivalent to continuity at a single point: the preimage of an open set containing $f(x)$ can fail to be open while still being a neighbourhood of $x$, which is exactly what continuity at $x$ asserts.

- **The inclusion in (e) may be strict for a continuous map.** For the inclusion of $(0,1)$ into $\mathbb{R}$ and $A = (0,1)$, the image of the closure is $(0,1)$ while the closure of the image is $[0,1]$. Equality for all $A$ is a strictly stronger condition, equivalent to $f$ being a closed map, and closed maps are defined three items below. Note that no map into a **discrete** space can witness strictness: there every subset is closed, so $f[\overline{A}] = f[A] = \overline{f[A]}$ always.

- **What the theorem does not say.** It says nothing about images of open sets: a continuous map need not carry open sets to open sets, and the failure is exactly what separates a continuous bijection from a homeomorphism. That separation is recorded on this page as a false statement with an explicit two-point witness.
