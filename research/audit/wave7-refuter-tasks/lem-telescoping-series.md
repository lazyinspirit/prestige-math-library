## Statement

Let $(b_k)$ be a sequence of reals and put $a_k := b_k - b_{k+1}$. Then the
partial sums of $\sum a_k$ are

$$s_n \;=\; \sum_{k<n} (b_k - b_{k+1}) \;=\; b_0 - b_n \qquad (n \in \mathbb{N}),$$

and consequently $\sum a_k$ converges ([[def-series]]) **if and only if** $(b_k)$
converges ([[def-real-limit]]), in which case

$$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (b_k - b_{k+1}) \;=\; b_0 - \lim_{k} b_k .$$

For a family from a general starting index $m$ the same statement holds with $b_0$
replaced by $b_m$, being this statement applied to the shifted sequence
$j \mapsto b_{j+m}$ ([[def-series]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(b_k)$ of reals, the sequence $a_k := b_k - b_{k+1}$, and the partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[L1] Telescoping of finite sums: $\sum_{k<n}(c_{k+1} - c_k) = c_n - c_0$ for every sequence $(c_k)$ of reals and every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L2] Algebra of limits: if $x_n \to x$ and $y_n \to y$ then $x_n - y_n \to x - y$ ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]]).

[L3] A constant sequence with value $c$ converges to $c$ ([[def-real-limit]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Apply [L1] to the sequence $c_k := -b_k$: it gives $\sum_{k<n}(-b_{k+1} - (-b_k)) = -b_n - (-b_0)$, that is $\sum_{k<n}(b_k - b_{k+1}) = b_0 - b_n$. [L1, algebra]

2.1 So $s_n = b_0 - b_n$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and equivalently $b_n = b_0 - s_n$. [step 1.1, algebra]

3.1 Suppose $(b_k)$ converges, say $b_n \to B$; then $s_n = b_0 - b_n \to b_0 - B$, so $\sum a_k$ converges with sum $b_0 - B$. [step 2.1, L2, L3]

3.2 Suppose conversely that $\sum a_k$ converges, say $s_n \to S$; then $b_n = b_0 - s_n \to b_0 - S$, so $(b_k)$ converges. [step 2.1, L2, L3]

4.1 The two implications give the stated equivalence, and in the convergent case step 3.1 gives the sum $b_0 - \lim_k b_k$. [step 3.1, step 3.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **The first term of $(b_k)$ survives and the rest cancel.** That is the whole content, and it is where an off-by-one error is easiest to make: the sum is $b_0 - \lim b_k$ and not $b_1 - \lim b_k$, because the partial sum $s_n = \sum_{k<n}$ starts at $k = 0$ ([[def-series]]). A series written from $k = 1$ telescopes to $b_1 - \lim b_k$ instead.

- **No sign or monotonicity hypothesis is used.** The lemma is an identity between finite sums followed by one limit rule, so it applies to sequences $(b_k)$ of any sign and is not restricted to the decreasing case in which telescoping series usually appear.

## Definition

Throughout this page $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), in particular an ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]]) and a field ([[def-field]]), and $\mathbb{N}$ is the set
of natural numbers ([[def-natural-numbers]]) with successor $\sigma(n) = n + 1$
([[def-nat-addition]]).

Let $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a sequence of reals, written $a_k$ for
$a(k)$. **Finite sums and finite products of $a$ are defined by recursion on the
upper index**, which is legitimate because of the recursion theorem
([[thm-recursion]]). That theorem produces a function of one variable, so the
running index has to be carried along inside the value: applying it to the set
$A = \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$, the starting element $(0, 0)$ and the function
$f(n, s) = (\sigma(n),\, s + a_n)$ gives a unique
$g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$ with

$$g(0) = (0, 0), \qquad g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n)) \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Write $g(n) = \big(\pi_1(g(n)),\, \Sigma_n\big)$ for its two coordinates.

**The first coordinate is the index itself, and that is a small induction, not an
observation** ([[thm-induction-principle]]). Indeed $\pi_1(g(0)) = 0$; and if
$\pi_1(g(n)) = n$, then
$g(\sigma(n)) = f\big(\pi_1(g(n)), \Sigma_n\big) = \big(\sigma(\pi_1(g(n))),\, \Sigma_n + a_{\pi_1(g(n))}\big) = \big(\sigma(n),\, \Sigma_n + a_n\big)$,
so $\pi_1(g(\sigma(n))) = \sigma(n)$. By induction $\pi_1(g(n)) = n$ for every
$n \in \mathbb{N}$. Only now may the second coordinate of the two displayed
clauses be read off, and doing so gives

$$\Sigma_0 = 0, \qquad \Sigma_{\sigma(n)} = \Sigma_n + a_n .$$

$\Sigma$ is moreover the **unique** function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with those
two properties: if $\Sigma'$ also has them then $n \mapsto (n, \Sigma'_n)$ satisfies
the two clauses defining $g$, hence equals $g$ by the uniqueness clause of
[[thm-recursion]], so $\Sigma' = \Sigma$.

We write $\sum_{k < n} a_k := \Sigma_n$. The same construction with starting
element $(0, 1)$ and $f(n, p) = (\sigma(n),\, p \cdot a_n)$, with the same
induction on the first coordinate and the same uniqueness argument, gives the
unique $\Pi : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with

$$\Pi_0 = 1, \qquad \Pi_{\sigma(n)} = \Pi_n \cdot a_n ,$$

and we write $\prod_{k < n} a_k := \Pi_n$.

**Notation.** For $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ we abbreviate

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \sum_{k < n+1} a_k, \qquad \prod_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \prod_{k < n+1} a_k,$$

and, for a general lower index $m$ with $m \le n + 1$, writing $d = n + 1 - m$
for the number of terms,

$$\sum_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \sum_{j < d} a_{m+j}, \qquad \prod_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \prod_{j < d} a_{m+j} .$$

When $m = n + 1$ we have $d = 0$ and the sum is **empty**, with value $0$, while
the empty product has value $1$. In the same spirit $\sum_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ is
notation for the empty sum $\Sigma_0 = 0$ and $\prod_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ for the
empty product $\Pi_0 = 1$; the index $-1$ never occurs as an element of
$\mathbb{N}$ and is only a way of writing "no terms".

Only finitely many values of $a$ enter $\sum_{k<n} a_k$, so the notation
$\sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\prod_{k<n} a_k$ is also used for a list
$a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$ of reals given without reference to any extension of the
list to all of $\mathbb{N}$: extend the list by $a_k = 0$ (respectively
$a_k = 1$) for $k \ge n$ and apply the definition above.

## Remarks

- **Why recursion and not "$a_0 + a_1 + \cdots + a_{n-1}$".** The dots are not a
  definition: they presuppose that the displayed pattern determines a value for
  every $n$, which is exactly what the recursion theorem
  ([[thm-recursion]]) supplies, and its uniqueness clause is what makes
  $\sum_{k<n} a_k$ a single well-determined real rather than a family of choices.
  Associativity and commutativity of addition are *not* used in the definition;
  they are used in the laws proved from it ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).
- **Naturals and rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$ (a convention used on the whole
  page).** A natural number $n$ and a rational number $r$ are not literally
  elements of $\mathbb{R}$: they enter $\mathbb{R}$ through the canonical
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$, which is an injective,
  order-preserving field homomorphism ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), restricting on
  positive naturals to $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} = 1_\mathbb{R} + \cdots + 1_\mathbb{R}$
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). Following ordinary practice, and only where no
  confusion is possible, we write $n$ for $\iota(n)$ and $r$ for $\iota(r)$; so,
  for instance, $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k<n} a_k$ means
  $\iota(n)^{-1} \cdot \sum_{k<n} a_k$, which makes sense because
  $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$. Exponents are the one place where the
  identification is deliberately NOT made: in $a^n$ and $a^r$ the exponent stays
  a natural, an integer or a rational ([[def-integer-power]],
  [[def-rational-power]]), never a real.
- The two indexings are related by $\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k = \sum_{k < n+1} a_k$, so
  a statement proved for one is available for the other. Sums over $k < n$ are
  the primitive form here because $\Sigma_0$, the empty sum, is then the base
  case of every induction, and no index outside $\mathbb{N}$ is ever needed.

## Definition

A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals **converges** to $x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for
every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with
$|x_k - x| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$. It is **Cauchy** when for
every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with
$|x_k - x_l| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$.

## Remarks

- Quantifying over rational $\varepsilon$ loses nothing: below any real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ lies a positive rational ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).
- $|\cdot|$ is the absolute value of [[def-real-order]].

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-real-numbers]]) and
a **sequence of reals** is a function $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$
([[def-sequence]]), written $(a_k)$; recall that $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$.

**Partial sums.** Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals. Its **sequence of partial
sums** is

$$s_n \;:=\; \sum_{k < n} a_k \qquad (n \in \mathbb{N}),$$

the finite sum of [[def-finite-sum]]. In particular $s_0 = 0$, the empty sum, and
$s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ for every $n$, those being exactly the two recursion clauses
that define the finite sum. Note that $s_n$ is the sum of the $n$ terms
$a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$, so the index $n$ counts terms rather than naming the last
one.

**Convergence, the sum, divergence.** The **series** of $(a_k)$, written
$\sum a_k$, **converges** when the sequence $(s_n)$ of partial sums converges
([[def-real-limit]]), and then the **sum of the series** is

$$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k \;:=\; \lim_{n} s_n .$$

The series **diverges** when $(s_n)$ does not converge. A convergent sequence of
reals has exactly one limit ([[lem-limit-unique]]), so the displayed symbol names
a single real number and nothing further has to be checked for it to be
well defined.

**Series with a general starting index.** Let $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $a$ be a
function on $\{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : k \ge m \,\}$, which we call a **family from
$m$** and write $(a_k)_{k \ge m}$. The series

$$\sum_{k \ge m} a_k$$

is by definition the series of the sequence $b_j := a_{j + m}$,
$j \in \mathbb{N}$, which is a genuine sequence of reals; it converges exactly
when that series converges, and its sum is then written
$\sum_{k = m}^{\infty} a_k$. Its partial sums are

$$\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k \;=\; \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j} \qquad (n \ge m),$$

in the notation of [[def-finite-sum]], the value at $n = m$ being the empty sum
$0$. A sequence on $\mathbb{N}$ is the case $m = 0$, and the two readings of
$\sum a_k$ agree there, since $b_j = a_j$.

**This clause is not a convenience.** Sequences in this library are functions on
$\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$ ([[def-sequence]]), while many of the
classical series are built from expressions that are undefined at the index $0$:
$1/k$, $1/k^{p}$ and $|a_k|^{1/k}$ all require $k \ge 1$. Writing such a series as
$\sum_{k \ge 1} a_k$ names an honest object, whereas writing it as a sequence on
$\mathbb{N}$ would require a value at an index where the defining expression has
none. Every statement on this page says which starting index it uses.

**Tail series.** For $N \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$N$-th tail series** of
$\sum a_k$ is $\sum_{k \ge N} a_k$, that is the series of the $N$-th tail
$a^{(N)}$ of [[def-sequence]], whose terms are $a^{(N)}_j = a_{j+N}$. The
$0$-th tail series is the series itself.

## Remarks

- **"Diverges" here means "does not converge", and nothing more.** A divergent
  series may have partial sums that run away to $+\infty$, or to $-\infty$, or
  that oscillate without settling anywhere. The three behaviours are not
  distinguished by the word, and no statement on this page uses "diverges" to
  mean "the partial sums are unbounded" unless it says so.

- **The symbol $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k$ is defined only for a convergent
  series.** It denotes a real number, not a formal object, and it is illegitimate
  to write it down before convergence has been established. Where a proof needs
  to speak of the series without knowing whether it converges, it speaks of
  $(a_k)$ and of $(s_n)$.

- **Two indices, doing different work.** The index $k$ runs over the terms and is
  bound; the index $n$ runs over the partial sums and is the variable in which the
  limit is taken. Confusing them is the commonest slip in the subject, and it is
  the reason the definition above fixes $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ rather than
  $\sum_{k \le n} a_k$: with this choice the recursion $s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ is
  the one supplied by [[def-finite-sum]], with no shift anywhere.

## Statement

Let $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be sequences of reals, let
$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, and let $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, with finite sums and
finite products as in [[def-finite-sum]]. Then:

1. **Additivity.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k$.
2. **Scaling.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k$; in particular $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda = n\lambda$, where $n$ denotes the canonical natural $\iota(n) \in \mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).
3. **Splitting.** If $m \le n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k$, and $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n} a_k = \Big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k\Big)$.
4. **Monotonicity.** If $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$. In particular, if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, every single term satisfies $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$ for $j < n$, and $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ forces $a_k = 0$ for every $k < n$.
5. **Telescoping.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}\big(c_{k+1} - c_k\big) = c_n - c_0$.
6. **Products.** $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k) = \Big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\Big)$; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, and if $a_k > 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k > 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\lambda$, and naturals $m, n$. Write $\Sigma_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\Pi_n = \prod_{k<n} a_k$.

[L1] Recursion clauses ([[def-finite-sum]]): $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ and $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n$; $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1$ and $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) \cdot a_n$; and $\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k = \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j}$ for $m \le n$, likewise for products.

[L2] Field axioms: addition and multiplication are associative and commutative, $0$ and $1$ are the identities, $x - x = 0$, and multiplication distributes over addition ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]); and $0 \cdot x = 0$, which is not an axiom but a lemma ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

[L3] Induction principle: a property holding at $0$ and inherited by successors holds at every natural ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L4] Adding inequalities: $x \le y$ and $u \le v$ imply $x + u \le y + v$. [[lem-of-add-order]] states the STRICT forms and only those ($x < y \Rightarrow x + c < y + c$, and $x < y$ with $u < v$ giving $x + u < y + v$); the nonstrict form used throughout below is those two together with the cases $x = y$ and $u = v$, which are settled by trichotomy, the order being total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] The canonical embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a field homomorphism, so $\iota(0) = 0$ and $\iota(n+1) = \iota(n) + 1$, and $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L6] Sign rules: a product of two positives is positive ([[lem-of-sign-rules]], claim 1), and a product of two nonnegatives is nonnegative, since a factor equal to $0$ makes the product $0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]) and otherwise both factors are positive; and $1 > 0$, which is proved in [[cor-of-one-positive]] and stated by none of the items named above.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 0$: every claim holds at $n = 0$, since both sides of claim 1 are $0 = 0 + 0$, both sides of claim 2 are $0 = \lambda \cdot 0$ and $0 = \iota(0)\lambda$, claim 4 reads $0 \le 0$ with no term to bound and the hypothesis $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ giving nothing to prove, claim 5 reads $0 = c_0 - c_0$, and claim 6 reads $1 = 1 \cdot 1$ with $1 > 0$. [base, L1, L2, L5, L6]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for this $n$ and for all sequences $a, b, c$ and all $\lambda$. [ih]

1.3 Splitting, claim 3, by a separate induction on the number of trailing terms $d = n - m$ with $m$ fixed: for $d = 0$ the claim reads $\sum_{k<m} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + 0$ and $\prod_{k<m} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\big) \cdot 1$, which hold; and if $\sum_{k<m+d} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d} a_{m+j}$, then $\sum_{k<m+d+1} a_k = \sum_{k<m+d} a_k + a_{m+d} = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \big(\sum_{j<d} a_{m+j} + a_{m+d}\big) = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d+1} a_{m+j}$ by associativity, and identically for products with $1$ in place of $0$ and multiplication in place of addition, so induction on $d$ gives claim 3 for every $m \le n$. [L1, L2, L3]

2.1 Additivity at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k\big) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) + \big(\sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n\big) = \sum_{k<n+1} a_k + \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$, using the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of addition. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Scaling at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda a_k = \sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda\big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) = \lambda \sum_{k<n+1} a_k$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and distributivity; taking $a_k = 1$ for all $k$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda = \sum_{k<n} \lambda + \lambda = \iota(n)\lambda + \lambda = (\iota(n) + 1)\lambda = \iota(n+1)\lambda$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L5]

2.3 Monotonicity at $n+1$: assume $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n+1$; then $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$, so the hypothesis gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$, and adding the inequality $a_n \le b_n$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n \le \sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n = \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$. [step 1.2, L1, L4]

2.4 Telescoping at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(c_{k+1} - c_k) = \sum_{k<n}(c_{k+1} - c_k) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = (c_n - c_0) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = c_{n+1} - c_0$, by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and the field identities. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.5 Products at $n+1$: $\prod_{k<n+1}(a_k b_k) = \big(\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k)\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n+1} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n+1} b_k\big)$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of multiplication; and if every $a_k \ge 0$ for $k < n+1$ then $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) a_n$ is a product of two nonnegatives, hence nonnegative, with the same argument giving positivity from positivity since $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1 > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L6]

3.1 Consequences of monotonicity, completing claim 4: monotonicity itself holds at every $n$, by the induction principle applied to the base case of step 1.1 and the successor step 2.3, so it is available for an arbitrary $n$ in what follows; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then comparing with the zero sequence gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge \sum_{k<n} 0 = 0$; for $j < n$ splitting at $j$ and then at $j+1$ writes $\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<j} a_k + a_j + \sum_{k=j+1}^{n-1} a_k$ with the first and third summands $\ge 0$, so $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$; and if moreover $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ then $0 \le a_j \le 0$ for every $j < n$, so $a_j = 0$. [step 1.1, step 2.3, step 1.3, L3, L4, L2]

4.1 By the induction principle claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and claim 3 was proved in step 1.3 with its consequences in step 3.1, so all six laws hold. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, step 2.5, step 1.3, step 3.1, L3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ be sequences of reals ([[def-sequence]]) converging to
$x$ and $y$ respectively ([[def-real-limit]]), and let $c \in \mathbb{R}$. Then

$$x_k + y_k \to x + y, \qquad c\,x_k \to c\,x, \qquad x_k - y_k \to x - y, \qquad x_k y_k \to x y,$$

and if in addition $y \ne 0$ and $y_k \ne 0$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, then

$$\frac{1}{y_k} \to \frac{1}{y} \qquad \text{and} \qquad \frac{x_k}{y_k} \to \frac{x}{y}.$$

The quotient case rests on an eventual lower bound for $|y_k|$, proved below
rather than assumed: $|y_k| > |y|/2$ for all sufficiently large $k$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $(x_k)$, $(y_k)$ of reals with $(x_k)$ converging to $x$ and $(y_k)$ converging to $y$, and a real $c$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]). For the last two claims we assume in addition $y \ne 0$ and $y_k \ne 0$ for every $k$.

[L1] Convergence, quantified over rational $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-real-limit]]).

[L2] Absolute value and the triangle inequality: $|uv| = |u|\,|v|$, $|u| \ge 0$, $|u| = 0$ if and only if $u = 0$, $|-u| = |u|$, and $|a + b| \le |a| + |b|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L3] Real versus rational $\varepsilon$: for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, by density ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) or by the Archimedean property ([[thm-of-archimedean]]) applied to $1/\eta$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]); consequently the convergence test of [[def-real-limit]] may equivalently be run with real $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-sequence]]).

[L4] Convergent sequences are bounded ([[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]]), and a constant sequence $(c)$ is bounded by $|c|$ ([[def-sequence]]).

[L5] A null sequence times a bounded sequence is null ([[lem-null-times-bounded]]).

[L6] Reverse triangle inequality: $\bigl||u| - |v|\bigr| \le |u - v|$, hence $|u| \ge |v| - |v - u|$ ([[cor-of-reverse-triangle]]).

[L7] Inverses and order: $a > 0$ implies $a^{-1} > 0$; $0 < a < b$ implies $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$; $(u^{-1})^{-1} = u$ for $u \ne 0$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-field]]).

[L8] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: adding a constant and adding inequalities preserve the order, multiplying a strict inequality by a positive factor preserves it, and $\le$ and $<$ compose transitively; trichotomy holds, and since $u \ge 0$ means $u > 0$ or $u = 0$, an element with $u \ge 0$ and $u \ne 0$ satisfies $u > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]). Moreover $2 = 1 + 1 > 0$ and $2$ is invertible: $0 < 1$ in any ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]) and the positives are closed under addition, so $2 > 0$ and in particular $2 \ne 0$ ([[def-ordered-field]]), whence $2^{-1}$ exists ([[def-field]]).

[L9] Rational arithmetic: $\varepsilon/2$ is a rational $> 0$ whenever $\varepsilon$ is, and $\varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$ ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]); the order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total, so finitely many thresholds admit a common index ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Reduction to null sequences: for any sequence $(z_k)$ of reals and any real $z$, the statements "$(z_k)$ converges to $z$" and "$(z_k - z)$ converges to $0$" are literally the same condition, because $|(z_k - z) - 0| = |z_k - z|$ for every $k$. [L1, L2]

1.2 Sum rule, in general form. Let $(u_k) \to u$ and $(v_k) \to v$ be any convergent sequences of reals and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be rational; take $K_1$ with $|u_k - u| < \varepsilon/2$ for $k \ge K_1$ and $K_2$ with $|v_k - v| < \varepsilon/2$ for $k \ge K_2$, and let $K$ be an index at least as large as both. For $k \ge K$, $|(u_k + v_k) - (u + v)| = |(u_k - u) + (v_k - v)| \le |u_k - u| + |v_k - v| < \varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$; hence $u_k + v_k \to u + v$, and in particular $x_k + y_k \to x + y$. [L1, L2, L8, L9, algebra]

1.3 Boundedness: every convergent sequence of reals is bounded, and every constant sequence $(d)$ is bounded by $|d|$. [L4]

1.4 Quotient preparation. Assume $y \ne 0$ and $y_k \ne 0$ for every $k$. Then $|y| > 0$ by [L2], so $|y|/2 > 0$; running the convergence test of $(y_k)$ with the real number $|y|/2$ as tolerance, which [L3] licenses, produces $K_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|y_k - y| < |y|/2$ for all $k \ge K_0$. [L1, L2, L3, L7, L8, choose]

2.1 Scalar rule, in general form. Let $(u_k) \to u$ and let $d \in \mathbb{R}$. By step 1.1 the sequence $(u_k - u)$ is null and by step 1.3 the constant sequence $(d)$ is bounded, so $(d(u_k - u)) = (d u_k - d u)$ is null by [L5]; by step 1.1 again, $d u_k \to d u$, and in particular $c x_k \to c x$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, L5, algebra]

2.2 Product rule, in general form. Let $(u_k) \to u$ and $(v_k) \to v$, and write $u_k v_k - u v = u_k(v_k - v) + v(u_k - u)$. By step 1.1 both $(v_k - v)$ and $(u_k - u)$ are null; by step 1.3 both $(u_k)$ and the constant sequence $(v)$ are bounded; so both $(u_k(v_k - v))$ and $(v(u_k - u))$ are null by [L5], and their sum is null by step 1.2 applied with both limits equal to $0$. By step 1.1, $u_k v_k \to u v$, and in particular $x_k y_k \to x y$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, L5, algebra]

2.3 Eventual lower bound. For every $k \ge K_0$, the reverse triangle inequality gives $|y_k| \ge |y| - |y - y_k| = |y| - |y_k - y| > |y| - |y|/2 = |y|/2 > 0$; so $|y_k| > |y|/2$ for all $k \ge K_0$, and in particular $|y_k| \ne 0$ there. [step 1.4, L2, L6, L8]

3.1 Difference rule. Applying step 2.1 to the sequence $(y_k)$ with $d = -1$ gives $-y_k \to -y$; the sum rule of step 1.2 applied to $(x_k)$ and $(-y_k)$ then gives $x_k - y_k = x_k + (-y_k) \to x + (-y) = x - y$. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L8, algebra]

3.2 Reciprocal estimate. For $k \ge K_0$ we have $y_k \ne 0$ and $|y_k| > |y|/2 > 0$, so [L7] applied to $0 < |y|/2 < |y_k|$ gives $0 < |y_k|^{-1} < 2/|y|$, and therefore $\left|\dfrac{1}{y_k} - \dfrac{1}{y}\right| = \dfrac{|y - y_k|}{|y_k|\,|y|} \le \dfrac{2}{|y|^2}\,|y_k - y|$. [step 2.3, L2, L7, L8, algebra]

4.1 Reciprocal rule. Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real and put $\eta := \varepsilon |y|^2/2$, a real $> 0$; by [L3] there is $K_1$ with $|y_k - y| < \eta$ for all $k \ge K_1$. For every $k$ at least as large as both $K_0$ and $K_1$, step 3.2 gives $\left|\dfrac{1}{y_k} - \dfrac{1}{y}\right| \le \dfrac{2}{|y|^2}|y_k - y| < \dfrac{2}{|y|^2}\,\eta = \varepsilon$; hence $1/y_k \to 1/y$. [step 3.2, L1, L3, L7, L8, L9, algebra]

5.1 Quotient rule. By step 4.1 the sequence $(1/y_k)$ converges to $1/y$, so the product rule of step 2.2 applied to $(x_k)$ and $(1/y_k)$ gives $x_k/y_k = x_k \cdot (1/y_k) \to x \cdot (1/y) = x/y$. [step 2.2, step 4.1, algebra]

6.1 All the claims are established: the sum rule in step 1.2, the scalar rule in step 2.1, the difference rule in step 3.1, the product rule in step 2.2, and the reciprocal and quotient rules in steps 4.1 and 5.1. [step 1.2, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, step 4.1, step 5.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The quotient case is where proofs usually cheat.** The estimate $|1/y_k - 1/y| = |y - y_k| / (|y_k||y|)$ is worthless until $|y_k|$ is known to stay away from $0$: without a lower bound the denominator can be arbitrarily small and the fraction arbitrarily large, even while $|y - y_k|$ shrinks. Step 2.3 supplies that bound, $|y_k| > |y|/2$ for $k \ge K_0$, and it is proved from the reverse triangle inequality, not assumed.

- The hypothesis $y_k \ne 0$ for every $k$ is only there so that $1/y_k$ is defined for every index. It is not needed for the limit: step 2.3 shows $|y_k| > |y|/2 > 0$ from $K_0$ on, so a sequence with $y \ne 0$ has at most finitely many zero terms, and by [[lem-limit-of-tail]] one may pass to the $K_0$-th tail and read the conclusion there.

- The hypothesis $y \ne 0$ cannot be dropped. With $x_k = 1$ and $y_k = 1/(k+1)$, both sequences converge: the first is constant ([[def-sequence]]) and the second is null ([[fs-limit-preserves-strict-inequality]]), so $y = 0$. Yet $x_k/y_k = k+1$, and no real $M$ bounds every $k+1$, by the Archimedean property ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); so the quotient sequence is unbounded, hence not convergent by [[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]].

- Nothing in the proof uses completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ beyond the Archimedean property invoked in [L3], so the same rules hold verbatim for sequences of rationals.
