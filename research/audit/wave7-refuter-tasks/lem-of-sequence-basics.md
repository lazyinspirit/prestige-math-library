## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $(x_k)$, $(y_k)$ be
sequences in $F$, with convergence in $F$, Cauchyness in $F$, boundedness and
subsequences as in [[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]]. Then:

1. **Limits are unique.** If $x_k \to L$ and $x_k \to L'$ in $F$, then $L = L'$.
   A convergent sequence therefore has exactly one limit in $F$ and the notation
   $\lim_k x_k$ denotes it unambiguously. This is the licence under which the
   remaining clauses are written as equations between limits, and it is not new
   here: [[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]] already establishes it, in an
   arbitrary ordered field and with no completeness or Archimedean hypothesis.
   It is restated as clause 1 so that this lemma is self-contained as the
   citation target of the whole abstract chain on this page.
2. **Limits preserve non-strict inequalities.** If $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ both
   converge in $F$ and $x_k \le y_k$ for every $k$, then

   $$\lim_k x_k \;\le\; \lim_k y_k .$$

3. **Convergent implies Cauchy.** If $(x_k)$ converges in $F$, it is Cauchy in
   $F$.
4. **Cauchy implies bounded.** If $(x_k)$ is Cauchy in $F$, it is bounded.
5. **A Cauchy sequence with a convergent subsequence converges.** If $(x_k)$ is
   Cauchy in $F$ and some subsequence $(x_{n_j})$ converges in $F$, then $(x_k)$
   converges in $F$ as well, and

   $$\lim_k x_k \;=\; \lim_j x_{n_j} .$$

   Both sides are asserted to exist: the right-hand side by hypothesis, the
   left-hand side as part of the conclusion.

**Why this is a separate item.** Each of the five is proved in this library for
sequences of *reals*, and none of those proofs may be cited here.
[[rem-sequence-conventions]] is explicit about it: a theorem about sequences of
reals is a theorem about $\mathbb{R}$, and the fact that its argument would
transfer to an arbitrary ordered field is a statement about the argument, not a
licence to cite the result. The five are collected here, proved from the ordered
field axioms alone, so that the completeness equivalences of this page have one
place to cite instead of five inline reconstructions.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and sequences $(x_k)$, $(y_k)$ in $F$. Each of the five claims is proved under its own stated hypotheses; nothing is assumed of $(x_k)$ or $(y_k)$ outside the claim being proved.

[L1] Sequences in an ordered field: $(x_k)$ converges to $L$ in $F$ when for every $\varepsilon > 0$ in $F$ there is $N \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_k - L| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge N$; $(x_k)$ is Cauchy in $F$ when for every $\varepsilon > 0$ in $F$ there is $N \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge N$; $(x_k)$ is bounded when there is $M \in F$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for every $k$; and a subsequence of $(x_k)$ is a sequence $(x_{n_j})_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ for a strictly increasing $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Triangle inequality: $|u + v| \le |u| + |v|$ for $u, v \in F$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L3] Absolute value: $|u| \ge 0$; $|u| = 0$ if and only if $u = 0$; $|-u| = |u|$; and $u \le |u|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L4] Order in $F$: exactly one of $u < v$, $u = v$, $v < u$ holds, so the order is total, and both $<$ and $\le$ are transitive; adding a constant preserves the strict order and two strict inequalities may be added ([[lem-of-add-order]]); the nonstrict forms of those two, used below, are the strict forms together with the equality cases, which trichotomy settles ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] Halving: $0 < 1_F$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]), so $2 \cdot 1_F = 1_F + 1_F > 0$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]) and $2 \cdot 1_F$ is nonzero, hence invertible with $(2 \cdot 1_F)^{-1} > 0$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]). Writing $\varepsilon/2$ for $\varepsilon \cdot (2 \cdot 1_F)^{-1}$, an $\varepsilon > 0$ gives $\varepsilon/2 > 0$ and $\varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L6] Induction principle on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L7] Growth of an index map: a strictly increasing $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ satisfies $n_j \ge j$ for every $j$ ([[lem-index-map-grows]]).

[L8] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total and transitive, so of any two indices one is $\ge$ the other, and every index $k$ satisfies $k \le N$ or $k \ge N$ ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 If $d \in F$ satisfies $d < \varepsilon$ for every $\varepsilon > 0$ in $F$, then $d \le 0$: were $d > 0$, the instance $\varepsilon = d$ would give $d < d$, which trichotomy forbids, so $d > 0$ fails and totality leaves $d \le 0$. [L4, algebra]

1.2 For every $\varepsilon > 0$ in $F$ one has $\varepsilon/2 > 0$ and $\varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$. [L5]

1.3 **Claim 1.** Assume $x_k \to L$ and $x_k \to L'$, and let $\varepsilon > 0$ in $F$ be arbitrary; choose $N_1$ with $|x_k - L| < \varepsilon/2$ for $k \ge N_1$, choose $N_2$ with $|x_k - L'| < \varepsilon/2$ for $k \ge N_2$, and let $N$ be whichever of $N_1, N_2$ is the larger. [L1, L8, choose]

1.4 **Claim 2.** Assume $x_k \to L$, $y_k \to M$ and $x_k \le y_k$ for every $k$, and let $\varepsilon > 0$ in $F$ be arbitrary; choose $N_1$ with $|x_k - L| < \varepsilon/2$ for $k \ge N_1$, choose $N_2$ with $|y_k - M| < \varepsilon/2$ for $k \ge N_2$, and let $N$ be the larger of the two. [L1, L8, choose]

1.5 **Claim 3.** Assume $x_k \to L$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ in $F$ be arbitrary; choose $N$ with $|x_k - L| < \varepsilon/2$ for all $k \ge N$. [L1, choose]

1.6 **Claim 4.** For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there is $B \in F$ with $|x_j| \le B$ for all $j \le n$, by induction on $n$: for $n = 0$ take $B = |x_0|$; and given such a $B$ for $n$, totality of the order on $F$ gives either $|x_{n+1}| \le B$, in which case the same $B$ serves for $n + 1$, or $B < |x_{n+1}|$, in which case $|x_{n+1}|$ serves for $n+1$ by transitivity. [L1, L4, L6]

1.7 **Claim 4, continued.** Assume $(x_k)$ is Cauchy; since $1_F > 0$, choose $N$ with $|x_k - x_l| < 1_F$ for all $k, l \ge N$, so that for $k \ge N$ one has $|x_k| = |(x_k - x_N) + x_N| \le |x_k - x_N| + |x_N| < 1_F + |x_N|$. [L1, L2, L4, L5, choose]

1.8 **Claim 5.** Assume $(x_k)$ is Cauchy and $x_{n_j} \to L$ along a strictly increasing $n$, and let $\varepsilon > 0$ in $F$ be arbitrary; choose $N_1$ with $|x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon/2$ for $k, l \ge N_1$, choose $N_2$ with $|x_{n_j} - L| < \varepsilon/2$ for $j \ge N_2$, and let $N$ be the larger of the two, so that $n_N \ge N \ge N_1$ and $N \ge N_2$. [L1, L7, L8, choose]

2.1 For every $k \ge N$ in the situation of step 1.3: $|L - L'| = |(L - x_k) + (x_k - L')| \le |L - x_k| + |x_k - L'| = |x_k - L| + |x_k - L'| < \varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$. [step 1.2, step 1.3, L2, L3, L4]

2.2 For every $k \ge N$ in the situation of step 1.4: $L - M = (L - x_k) + (x_k - y_k) + (y_k - M)$, where $L - x_k \le |L - x_k| < \varepsilon/2$ and $y_k - M \le |y_k - M| < \varepsilon/2$ and $x_k - y_k \le 0$; adding, $L - M < \varepsilon$. [step 1.2, step 1.4, L3, L4]

2.3 For all $k, l \ge N$ in the situation of step 1.5: $|x_k - x_l| = |(x_k - L) + (L - x_l)| \le |x_k - L| + |x_l - L| < \varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$. [step 1.2, step 1.5, L2, L3, L4]

2.4 In the situation of steps 1.6 and 1.7, let $B$ be a bound for $|x_j|$ over $j \le N$ and set $M := B + 1_F + |x_N|$; then $B \ge |x_0| \ge 0$ and $1_F + |x_N| > 0$, so $M \ge B$ and $M \ge 1_F + |x_N|$, whence $|x_k| \le B \le M$ for $k \le N$ and $|x_k| < 1_F + |x_N| \le M$ for $k \ge N$; as every index satisfies $k \le N$ or $k \ge N$, $(x_k)$ is bounded. [step 1.6, step 1.7, L1, L3, L4, L8]

2.5 For every $k \ge N$ in the situation of step 1.8: $|x_k - L| = |(x_k - x_{n_N}) + (x_{n_N} - L)| \le |x_k - x_{n_N}| + |x_{n_N} - L| < \varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$, the first summand being covered because $k \ge N \ge N_1$ and $n_N \ge N_1$. [step 1.2, step 1.8, L2, L4]

3.1 By step 2.1 the element $|L - L'|$ is below every $\varepsilon > 0$, so $|L - L'| \le 0$; with $|L - L'| \ge 0$ this forces $|L - L'| = 0$ and hence $L = L'$, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L3, L4]

3.2 By step 2.2 the element $L - M$ is below every $\varepsilon > 0$, so $L - M \le 0$, that is $L \le M$, which is claim 2. [step 1.1, step 2.2, L4]

3.3 Step 2.3 produced, for an arbitrary $\varepsilon > 0$, an $N$ beyond which all pairs are within $\varepsilon$, so $(x_k)$ is Cauchy in $F$, which is claim 3. [step 2.3, L1]

4.1 Step 2.5 produced, for an arbitrary $\varepsilon > 0$, an $N$ beyond which $|x_k - L| < \varepsilon$, so $(x_k)$ converges in $F$ with $x_k \to L$; since also $x_{n_j} \to L$, step 3.1 identifies both limits as $L$ and gives $\lim_k x_k = \lim_j x_{n_j}$, which is claim 5. [step 2.5, step 3.1, L1]

5.1 Claims 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are steps 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 2.4 and 4.1 respectively, so all five hold. [step 2.4, step 3.1, step 3.2, step 3.3, step 4.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Nothing above uses the Archimedean property, and nothing above uses
  completeness.** The five claims hold in every ordered field, including
  $\mathbb{R}(t)$ and $\mathbb{R}((t^{-1}))$. That is what makes them safe to
  use on both sides of every implication proved on this page.

- **Claim 2 is genuinely non-strict.** From $x_k < y_k$ at every index one gets
  only $L \le M$: the sequences $x_k = 0$ and $y_k = \varepsilon/(k+1)$ in an
  Archimedean $F$ have $x_k < y_k$ and equal limits. The real-number version of
  this warning is recorded at [[lem-limit-preserves-order]].

- **There is deliberately no arithmetic clause here.** Nothing above lets one
  add, multiply or divide two limits in a general ordered field, and no item in
  this library does: [[thm-algebra-of-limits]] is stated for sequences of reals,
  and by the rule recalled above it may not be cited for a general $F$. No proof
  on this page needs such a clause; every abstract argument here works with the
  defining $\varepsilon$ and $N$ directly, or with clauses 1 to 5.

- **Claim 4 avoids any appeal to a maximum of a finite set.** The library's
  finite-maximum lemma [[lem-finite-set-has-max]] is stated for $\mathbb{R}$,
  so it is unavailable here for the same reason the other four real-valued
  lemmas are; step 1.6 replaces it by an induction that uses nothing but
  totality of the order of $F$.

The read-only DeepSeek V4 Pro audit-refuter received the complete target and every cited dependency and returned CLEAN. Boundary evidence: Zero case (step 1.1) correctly handles d ≤ 0 from d < ε for all ε > 0. Induction base (step 1.6, n = 0) is trivial. Non‑strict inequality additions are justified via the ordered‑field axioms. Cauchy condition with ε = 1ᶠ yields the tail bound. The proof covers all indices (k ≤ N or k ≥ N) and does not rely on completeness or the Archimedean property. No counterexample was found in any ordered field; the classical metric‑space arguments transfer intact. Checked surface: The title, public statement, every numbered proof step (1.1–5.1), and the Remarks were read in full. ``` Alpha adjudicated the return against the current item and cited dependencies on disk and found no fatal mathematical or dependency-citation defect.

## Statement

In any ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, the multiplicative identity
satisfies $0 < 1$; that is, $1 \in P$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$ and multiplicative identity $1$ ([[def-field]]).

[L1] In any field $1 \neq 0$ ([[def-field]]).

[L2] For every $x \neq 0$ the square satisfies $x^2 > 0$ ([[lem-of-square-positive]]).

[L3] The identity axiom gives $1 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1^2$ ([[def-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By the field axioms $1 \neq 0$, and $1 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1^2$. [L1, L3]

2.1 Since $1 \neq 0$, applying the square lemma with $x = 1$ gives $1^2 > 0$. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 Because $1 = 1^2$, it follows that $1 > 0$, i.e. $0 < 1$. [step 2.1, step 1.1, L3] ∎

## Definition

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ ([[def-field]]) together with a subset
$P \subseteq F$, the set of **positive** elements (the *positive cone*),
satisfying:

- **(O1) Trichotomy.** For each $x \in F$, exactly one of the following holds:
  $x \in P$, or $x = 0$, or $-x \in P$.
- **(O2) Closure.** If $x, y \in P$ then $x + y \in P$ and $x \cdot y \in P$.

We write $x > 0$ for $x \in P$ (read "$x$ is positive"), and define the order by

$$a < b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; b - a \in P, \qquad a \le b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; a < b \text{ or } a = b.$$

Thus $a > b$ means $b < a$, and $a \ge b$ means $b \le a$. An element $x$ with
$-x \in P$ (equivalently $x < 0$) is called **negative**.

## Remarks

- By trichotomy applied to $b - a$, for any $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$,
  $a = b$, $a > b$ holds; this makes $\le$ a total order.
- (O2) says the positives are closed under addition and multiplication: sums and
  products of positives are positive.
- The rationals ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and both constructions of the reals
  ([[thm-reals-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-dedekind-ordered-field]]) are ordered
  fields, so every fact proved here from (O1)-(O2) holds in each of them.

## Definition

Throughout, $F$ is an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with its order and
its absolute value $|\cdot|$ ([[def-abs-value]]), and $\mathbb{N}$ is the set of
natural numbers with its order ([[def-natural-numbers]], [[def-nat-order]]).

A **sequence in $F$** is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to F$. We write $x_k$ for
$x(k)$ and $(x_k)$, or $(x_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$, for the function itself.

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence in $F$.

- $(x_k)$ is **bounded** when there is $M \in F$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for every
  $k \in \mathbb{N}$.
- $(x_k)$ **converges to** $L \in F$ when

  $$\text{for every } \varepsilon \in F \text{ with } \varepsilon > 0 \text{ there is } N \in \mathbb{N} \text{ such that } |x_k - L| < \varepsilon \text{ for all } k \ge N.$$

  We then write $x_k \to L$ *in $F$*. The sequence is **convergent in $F$** when
  it converges to some $L \in F$, and **divergent in $F$** otherwise.
- $(x_k)$ is **Cauchy in $F$** when

  $$\text{for every } \varepsilon \in F \text{ with } \varepsilon > 0 \text{ there is } N \in \mathbb{N} \text{ such that } |x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon \text{ for all } k, l \ge N.$$

- $(x_k)$ is **nondecreasing** when $x_j \le x_k$ for all $j \le k$,
  **increasing** when $x_j < x_k$ for all $j < k$, **nonincreasing** when
  $x_j \ge x_k$ for all $j \le k$, **decreasing** when $x_j > x_k$ for all
  $j < k$, and **monotone** when it is nondecreasing or nonincreasing.
- For a strictly increasing $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$, the **subsequence**
  of $(x_k)$ along $n$ is the composite $(x_{n_j})_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$. An
  element $L \in F$ is a **subsequential limit** of $(x_k)$ when some
  subsequence of $(x_k)$ converges to $L$ in $F$.

**Closed intervals and nesting.** For $a, b \in F$ with $a \le b$, the **closed
interval** with endpoints $a$ and $b$ is

$$[a,b]_F \;:=\; \{\, x \in F : a \le x \le b \,\},$$

and its **length** is $b - a \ge 0$. A sequence $(I_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of
closed intervals $I_k = [a_k, b_k]_F$ is **nested** when $I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k$
for every $k$. Its **lengths tend to $0$ in $F$** when the sequence
$(b_k - a_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges to $0$ in the sense above, that is,
when for every $\varepsilon > 0$ in $F$ there is $N \in \mathbb{N}$ with
$b_k - a_k < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge N$ (the absolute value may be dropped
because each length is $\ge 0$).

## Remarks

- **The thresholds range over $F$, and that is not a stylistic choice.** In an
  Archimedean ordered field one may equivalently test $\varepsilon$ over the
  canonical rationals, and that is what the $\mathbb{R}$-specific
  [[def-real-limit]] does; the two agree there, as the remark on rational and
  real $\varepsilon$ in [[def-sequence]] records. In a general $F$ they do
  **not** agree, because the canonical rationals need not be cofinal below the
  positive elements. A concrete failure lives on this page: in
  $\mathbb{R}((t^{-1}))$ every positive rational constant exceeds $t^{-1}$
  (clause 4 of [[lem-laurent-non-archimedean]], since a nonzero constant is
  nonzero at index $0$), so the sequence taking the value $0$ at even indices
  and $t^{-1}$ at odd indices would satisfy the Cauchy condition read with
  rational thresholds only, while failing it at $\varepsilon = t^{-2}$, where
  consecutive terms differ by $t^{-1} > t^{-2}$; and it has no limit at all,
  since a convergent sequence is Cauchy by the triangle inequality. Every
  definition above therefore
  quantifies over $\varepsilon \in F$, and no proof in this library may
  substitute a rational threshold in a field that has not been shown to be
  Archimedean.

- **These are the $\mathbb{R}$-notions with $\mathbb{R}$ replaced by $F$, and
  nothing more.** Sequence, tail, subsequence and boundedness are
  [[def-sequence]]; monotonicity is [[def-monotone-sequence]]; subsequential
  limits are [[def-subsequential-limit]]; convergence and Cauchyness are
  [[def-real-limit]]; closed intervals are the form $[a,b]$ of
  [[def-interval]]. Only the field in which the inequalities are read has
  changed.

- **Transfer of theorems is not automatic, and citing an $\mathbb{R}$-item for a
  general $F$ is a citation error.** A result proved about sequences of reals is
  a statement about $\mathbb{R}$. Many such proofs use only the ordered-field
  axioms and go through for any $F$ verbatim, and many others use completeness
  or the Archimedean property and do not. Which is which has to be settled by
  reading the proof; until an item is stated for a general ordered field, it may
  not be cited for one.

- **Limits are unique in any ordered field.** If $x_k \to L$ and $x_k \to L'$
  in $F$ with $L \ne L'$, put $\varepsilon := |L - L'|/2$, which is positive
  because $|L-L'| > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]) and $2 = 1 + 1 > 0$. Choose $N$
  beyond which both $|x_k - L| < \varepsilon$ and $|x_k - L'| < \varepsilon$
  hold, and take any $k \ge N$: the triangle inequality
  ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]], proved for an arbitrary ordered field) gives
  $|L - L'| \le |L - x_k| + |x_k - L'| < 2\varepsilon = |L - L'|$, which is
  impossible. So the limit, when it exists, is unique, and the notation
  $\lim_k x_k$ is unambiguous. No completeness and no Archimedean hypothesis is
  used.

- **Indexing starts at $0$**, as everywhere in this library, because
  $0 \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]). A nested sequence of intervals
  therefore begins with $I_0$, and a statement about "the first $N$ terms" means
  the indices $0, \dots, N-1$.

## Statement

For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and all $a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n \in \mathbb{R}$, the
set $\{a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ has a maximum and a minimum ([[def-max-min]]).

What is proved below is exactly the displayed statement, by induction on $n$.

The usual reading, that *every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has a
maximum and a minimum*, follows once one identifies the nonempty finite subsets
of $\mathbb{R}$ with the sets listable as $\{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$. That
identification is recorded as a stipulation in the Given below, because this page
has no definition of finiteness to prove it against. **It is discharged, not
merely assumed**: [[lem-finite-subsets-listable]] proves that the two
descriptions of a nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ agree. That lemma is
recorded in `justified_by` rather than in `deps`, since it is about the sets this
lemma quantifies over and therefore depends on this one. This is what licenses
the notation
$\max\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ and $\min\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ for finite sets of
**real** numbers from this page onwards.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Real numbers $a_0, a_1, a_2, \dots$; for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write $F_n := \{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$, so that $F_{n+1} = F_n \cup \{a_{n+1}\}$. A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and finite exactly when it equals $F_n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and some choice of $a_0, \dots, a_n$.

[A1] $P(n)$ denotes the statement: for all $a_0, \dots, a_n \in \mathbb{R}$, the set $F_n$ has a maximum and a minimum.

[L1] Maximum and minimum: $m = \max X$ means $m \in X$ and $x \le m$ for all $x \in X$; $m = \min X$ means $m \in X$ and $m \le x$ for all $x \in X$; each is unique when it exists ([[def-max-min]]).

[L2] Induction principle: if $P(0)$ holds and $P(n)$ implies $P(n+1)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $P(n)$ holds for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, where $n + 1$ denotes the successor $\sigma(n)$ ([[thm-induction-principle]], [[def-nat-addition]]).

[L3] The order on $\mathbb{R}$ is reflexive, total and transitive: $a \le a$; for all $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds, so at least one of $a \le b$ and $b \le a$ holds; and $a \le b$ with $b \le c$ gives $a \le c$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case: $F_0 = \{a_0\}$, and $a_0 \in F_0$ with $a_0 \le a_0$ by reflexivity, so $a_0$ is both a maximum and a minimum of $F_0$; hence $P(0)$ holds. [base, A1, L1, L3]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume $P(n)$, that is, for all reals $a_0, \dots, a_n$ the set $F_n$ has a maximum and a minimum. [ih, A1]

2.1 Let $a_0, \dots, a_{n+1} \in \mathbb{R}$ be arbitrary; by the inductive hypothesis the set $F_n$ has a maximum $M$ and a minimum $m$, and $F_{n+1} = F_n \cup \{a_{n+1}\}$. [step 1.2, L1]

3.1 By totality at least one of $a_{n+1} \le M$ and $M \le a_{n+1}$ holds. If $a_{n+1} \le M$, then $M \in F_n \subseteq F_{n+1}$, every element of $F_n$ is $\le M$ because $M = \max F_n$, and $a_{n+1} \le M$ as well, so $M$ is a maximum of $F_{n+1}$. If $M \le a_{n+1}$, then $a_{n+1} \in F_{n+1}$, every $x \in F_n$ satisfies $x \le M \le a_{n+1}$ hence $x \le a_{n+1}$ by transitivity, and $a_{n+1} \le a_{n+1}$, so $a_{n+1}$ is a maximum of $F_{n+1}$. Either way $F_{n+1}$ has a maximum. [step 2.1, L1, L3]

3.2 Dually, at least one of $m \le a_{n+1}$ and $a_{n+1} \le m$ holds. If $m \le a_{n+1}$, then $m \in F_{n+1}$ and every element of $F_{n+1}$ is $\ge m$, so $m$ is a minimum of $F_{n+1}$. If $a_{n+1} \le m$, then $a_{n+1} \in F_{n+1}$ and every $x \in F_n$ satisfies $a_{n+1} \le m \le x$ hence $a_{n+1} \le x$ by transitivity, so $a_{n+1}$ is a minimum of $F_{n+1}$. Either way $F_{n+1}$ has a minimum. [step 2.1, L1, L3]

4.1 Since $a_0, \dots, a_{n+1}$ were arbitrary, $F_{n+1}$ has a maximum and a minimum for every such list, that is, $P(n)$ implies $P(n+1)$. [step 3.1, step 3.2, A1]

5.1 The base case and the inductive step give $P(n)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ by the induction principle; since a nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is exactly a set of the form $F_n$, every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has both a maximum and a minimum. [step 1.1, step 4.1, given, L2, discharge-induction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the stipulation is discharged.** Finiteness itself is defined later, in [[def-countable]], as equinumerosity with a von Neumann natural; with that definition in hand [[lem-finite-subsets-listable]] proves that a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and finite exactly when it is listable as $\{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$, which is the Given below. So nothing on this page rests on an assumption that is never paid for; it is paid for later, and the payment is recorded in `justified_by`.
- **Only the total order is used, never completeness.** The base case needs reflexivity, the inductive step needs totality and transitivity, and the induction itself runs over $\mathbb{N}$. The same induction works in any totally ordered field; what is recorded here is its specialisation to $\mathbb{R}$.
- Nonemptiness is essential: $\emptyset$ is finite and has no maximum ([[def-max-min]]). Finiteness is essential too: $\{x \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < x < 1\}$ is bounded and has no maximum ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Combined with claim 1 of [[lem-max-is-sup]], this says every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has a supremum, and that the supremum is attained, because it equals the maximum. The infimum half is *not* part of [[lem-max-is-sup]], which speaks only of maxima and suprema; it follows from the minimum proved here together with the reflection identity $\inf X = -\sup(-X)$ ([[lem-reflection]], [[thm-infimum-property]]).

## Statement

Let $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ be a function, written $k \mapsto n_k$, and
recall that $n$ is **strictly increasing** when $n_j < n_k$ whenever $j < k$
([[def-sequence]], [[def-nat-order]]).

1. **Consecutive comparisons suffice.** If $n_i < n_{\sigma(i)}$ for every
   $i \in \mathbb{N}$, then $n$ is strictly increasing.
2. **Growth.** If $n$ is strictly increasing then $n_k \ge k$ for every
   $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

Claim 1 is what one checks in practice when exhibiting a subsequence; claim 2 is
what every later subsequence argument uses.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A function $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$, written $k \mapsto n_k$, with $\sigma$ the successor and the order of [[def-nat-order]]; claim 1 is proved under the standing assumption that $n_i < n_{\sigma(i)}$ for every $i$, and claim 2 under the standing assumption that $n$ is strictly increasing ([[def-sequence]]).

[A1] $Q(k)$ denotes the statement: $n_j < n_k$ for every $j < k$.

[A2] $P(k)$ denotes the statement: $n_k \ge k$.

[L1] Order and successor on $\mathbb{N}$: $m \le p$ means $m + i = p$ for some $i$, so $0 \le m$ for every $m$ because $0 + m = m$; and $\sigma(k) = k + 1$ with $\sigma(k) \ne k$, so $k < \sigma(k)$ ([[def-nat-order]], [[def-nat-addition]], [[lem-nat-add-identity]], [[lem-nat-successor-neq-self]]).

[L2] Discreteness: $m < p$ if and only if $\sigma(m) \le p$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]).

[L3] Induction principle: if $R(0)$ holds and $R(k)$ implies $R(\sigma(k))$ for every $k$, then $R(k)$ holds for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L4] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive and total, and satisfies trichotomy ([[thm-nat-linear-order]], [[lem-nat-trichotomy]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case for claim 1: $Q(0)$ holds vacuously, since no $j$ satisfies $j < 0$; indeed $0 \le j$ always holds, and $j < 0$ together with $0 \le j$ would contradict antisymmetry. [base, A1, L1, L4]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis for claim 1: fix $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume $Q(k)$, that is $n_j < n_k$ for every $j < k$. [ih, A1]

1.3 Base case for claim 2: $P(0)$ states $n_0 \ge 0$, which holds because $0 \le m$ for every natural $m$. [base, A2, L1]

1.4 Inductive hypothesis for claim 2: fix $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume $P(k)$, that is $k \le n_k$. [ih, A2]

2.1 Inductive step for claim 1: let $j < \sigma(k)$. By trichotomy either $k < j$, or $j = k$, or $j < k$. The case $k < j$ is impossible, since it gives $\sigma(k) \le j$ by [L2], which together with $j < \sigma(k)$ contradicts antisymmetry. If $j = k$ then $n_j = n_k < n_{\sigma(k)}$ by the standing assumption. If $j < k$ then $n_j < n_k$ by step 1.2 and $n_k < n_{\sigma(k)}$ by the standing assumption, so $n_j < n_{\sigma(k)}$ by transitivity. In every admissible case $n_j < n_{\sigma(k)}$, so $Q(\sigma(k))$ holds. [step 1.2, A1, L2, L4]

2.2 Inductive step for claim 2: $k < \sigma(k)$ by [L1], so strict increase gives $n_k < n_{\sigma(k)}$; combined with $k \le n_k$ from step 1.4 this yields $k < n_{\sigma(k)}$, hence $\sigma(k) \le n_{\sigma(k)}$ by [L2], which is $P(\sigma(k))$. [step 1.4, A2, L1, L2, L4]

3.1 Both inductions are complete, so by the induction principle $Q(k)$ holds for every $k$, which is claim 1, and $P(k)$ holds for every $k$, which is claim 2. [step 1.1, step 1.3, step 2.1, step 2.2, L3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Remarks

- Claim 2 is sharp: the identity map $n_k = k$ is strictly increasing with $n_k = k$ throughout, so no better bound than $n_k \ge k$ holds for all strictly increasing index maps.

- Claim 2 is exactly what makes a subsequence inherit a limit ([[lem-subsequence-inherits-limit]]): a threshold $K$ that works for the original sequence works unchanged for the subsequence, because $n_k \ge k \ge K$ whenever $k \ge K$.

- Nothing here is about $\mathbb{R}$; both claims are about $(\mathbb{N}, \le, \sigma)$ alone. Both are proved **by induction** ([L3]), and that is the method, not an order property. Claim 2 needs three order facts on top of the induction: that $0$ is least, which is what makes its base case $n_0 \ge 0$ true ([L1], step 1.3); discreteness ([[lem-nat-discrete]], [L2]), which upgrades $k < n_{\sigma(k)}$ to $\sigma(k) \le n_{\sigma(k)}$ (step 2.2); and transitivity in its mixed form, which composes $k \le n_k$ with $n_k < n_{\sigma(k)}$ into $k < n_{\sigma(k)}$ ([L4], step 2.2). Claim 1 additionally uses trichotomy and antisymmetry ([L4]).

- Of those three, neither the least element nor discreteness may be dropped. Discreteness alone is not enough: $(\mathbb{Z}, \le)$ is discrete in the same sense, $m < p$ iff $m + 1 \le p$, yet $k \mapsto k - 1$ is strictly increasing on $\mathbb{Z}$ with $n_k < k$ everywhere. What $\mathbb{Z}$ lacks is a least element to anchor the induction. A least element alone is not enough either, which is what fails over $\mathbb{Q}$: on the nonnegative rationals $x \mapsto x/2$ is strictly increasing and fixes the least element $0$, but $x/2 < x$ at every positive rational.

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ be sequences of reals ([[def-sequence]]) converging to
$x$ and $y$ respectively ([[def-real-limit]]). If $x_k \le y_k$ eventually, that
is for all $k$ from some index on, then

$$\lim_{k} x_k \;\le\; \lim_{k} y_k .$$

In particular, if $x_k \ge 0$ eventually then $\lim_k x_k \ge 0$, and if
$a \le x_k \le b$ eventually then $a \le \lim_k x_k \le b$.

The conclusion is **not** strict, and cannot be made strict; see the remarks
below and the false statement at the end of this page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $(x_k)$, $(y_k)$ of reals with $(x_k)$ converging to $x$, $(y_k)$ converging to $y$, and an index $K_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ with $x_k \le y_k$ for every $k \ge K_0$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]). Write $z_k := y_k - x_k$ and $z := y - x$.

[L1] Convergence, quantified over rational $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-real-limit]]).

[L2] Difference rule: $(z_k) = (y_k - x_k)$ converges to $y - x = z$ ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]]).

[L3] Small rationals: for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, by density ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) or by the Archimedean property ([[thm-of-archimedean]]) applied to $1/\eta$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

[L4] Absolute value: $|u| < c$ if and only if $-c < u < c$, for $c > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L5] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: adding a constant preserves $<$ and $\le$; $u \le v$ and $v < w$ give $u < w$; trichotomy, so exactly one of $z < 0$, $z = 0$, $z > 0$ holds and the negation of $z < 0$ is $z \ge 0$; $u \le v$ if and only if $v - u \ge 0$; and $u < u$ is impossible ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L6] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total, so any two indices admit a common upper bound ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

[L7] For $c \in \mathbb{R}$ the constant sequence $(c)$ converges to $c$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L8] A sequence of reals has at most one limit ([[lem-limit-unique]]), which is what licenses writing $\lim_k x_k$ and $\lim_k y_k$ for the limits named in the statement; without it those symbols would not denote.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 By [L2] the sequence $(z_k)$ converges to $z = y - x$, and by hypothesis $z_k = y_k - x_k \ge 0$ for every $k \ge K_0$. [given, L2, L5]

1.2 Suppose, for contradiction, that $z < 0$. [assume-contra]

2.1 Then $-z > 0$, so by [L3] we may choose a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < -z$. [step 1.2, L3, L5, choose]

3.1 Applying convergence of $(z_k)$ to this $\varepsilon$ gives $K_1 \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|z_k - z| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K_1$, hence $z_k - z < \varepsilon$ and so $z_k < z + \varepsilon$ for all such $k$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L1, L4, L5]

4.1 Fix an index $k$ with $k \ge K_0$ and $k \ge K_1$. Then $0 \le z_k < z + \varepsilon < z + (-z) = 0$, so $0 < 0$, which is impossible. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 3.1, L5, L6]

5.1 The assumption $z < 0$ is therefore untenable; by trichotomy $z \ge 0$, that is $y - x \ge 0$, that is $x \le y$; since $x$ and $y$ are the unique limits of $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ by [L8], that is exactly $\lim_k x_k \le \lim_k y_k$. Since $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ were an arbitrary pair satisfying the hypotheses, the conclusion applies to every such pair, and the two stated special cases are instances of it. Let $(w_k)$ be convergent. If $w_k \ge 0$ from some index on, apply the conclusion to the pair consisting of the constant sequence $0$, which converges to $0$ by [L7], and of $(w_k)$: it gives $0 \le \lim_k w_k$. If $a \le w_k \le b$ from some index on, apply it first to the constant sequence $a$ and $(w_k)$, then to $(w_k)$ and the constant sequence $b$: it gives $a \le \lim_k w_k$ and $\lim_k w_k \le b$. [step 4.1, L5, L7, L8, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- The two special cases are instances of the main claim, discharged in step 5.1 by taking one of the two sequences constant; that a constant sequence converges to its value ([[def-sequence]]) is the only extra ingredient they need.

- **The inequality does not become strict.** From $x_k < y_k$ for every $k$ one may conclude only $\lim x_k \le \lim y_k$; the witness $x_k = 0 < 1/(k+1) = y_k$ has equal limits ([[fs-limit-preserves-strict-inequality]]). Intuitively, the order relation $<$ is not preserved by passage to a limit because a strict gap may shrink to nothing, while $\le$ is preserved because it is closed under that shrinking.

- The proof routes through the single sequence $(z_k) = (y_k - x_k)$ and the difference rule of [[thm-algebra-of-limits]]. That is not an economy of writing only: it isolates the one thing being proved, namely that a sequence eventually $\ge 0$ cannot have a negative limit.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$, with
$|x|$ the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]). Then

$$|x| \ge 0; \quad |x| = 0 \iff x = 0; \quad -|x| \le x \le |x|; \quad |-x| = |x|; \quad |xy| = |x|\,|y|;$$

and, for every $c > 0$, one has $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and elements $x, y \in F$.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| = u$ if $u \ge 0$, and $|u| = -u$ if $u < 0$ ([[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Ordered-field order: trichotomy holds (for each $u$ exactly one of $u > 0$, $u = 0$, $u < 0$), $a < b$ means $b - a$ is positive, and sums and products of positives are positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Signs in products: $(-a)b = -(ab)$ and $(-a)(-b) = ab$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] Sign rules: a product of two elements of the same sign is positive, and a product of two elements of opposite sign is negative ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Case $x > 0$: by [L1] $|x| = x > 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; since $-x < 0$ we get $|-x| = -(-x) = x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -x < 0 < x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case pos, L1, L2, algebra]

1.2 Case $x = 0$: then $|x| = |0| = 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ holds with $|x| = 0$ and $x = 0$, while $|-x| = |0| = |x|$ and $-|x| = 0 \le 0 \le 0 = |x|$. [assume-case zero, L1]

1.3 Case $x < 0$: by [L1] $|x| = -x$, and [L2] gives $-x > 0$, so $|x| > 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; here $|-x| = -x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -(-x) = x \le x$ while $x < 0 < -x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case neg, L1, L2, algebra]

1.4 Case $x = 0$ or $y = 0$: then $xy = 0$, so $|xy| = 0$, and one of $|x|, |y|$ is $0$, whence $|x|\,|y| = 0 = |xy|$. [assume-case zerofactor, L1]

1.5 Case $x, y$ have the same sign (both positive or both negative): by [L4] $xy > 0$, so $|xy| = xy$, while $|x|\,|y| = xy$ by [L3] (for $x, y < 0$ this is $(-x)(-y) = xy$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case same, L1, L3, L4]

1.6 Case $x, y$ have opposite signs (one positive, one negative): by [L4] $xy < 0$, so $|xy| = -(xy)$, while $|x|\,|y| = -(xy)$ by [L3] (namely $x(-y)$ or $(-x)y$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case opposite, L1, L3, L4]

2.1 By trichotomy [L2] each $x$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.1-1.3, and in each we verified $|x| \ge 0$, that $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$, that $|-x| = |x|$, and that $-|x| \le x \le |x|$; hence all four hold for every $x$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, cases-exhaustive]

2.2 By trichotomy [L2] each pair $x, y$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.4-1.6, and in each $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$ for all $x, y$. [step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6, cases-exhaustive]

3.1 Let $c > 0$: if $|x| < c$ then $-c < -|x| \le x \le |x| < c$ by [step 2.1] and [L2], so $-c < x < c$; conversely if $-c < x < c$ then both $x < c$ and $-x < c$, and since $|x|$ equals $x$ or $-x$ by [L1], we get $|x| < c$, so $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$. [step 2.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b, c, d \in F$.

1. **Translation invariance.** If $a < b$ then $a + c < b + c$.
2. **Adding inequalities.** If $a < b$ and $c < d$ then $a + c < b + d$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b, c, d \in F$.

[L1] For $x, y \in F$, the relation $x < y$ means $y - x \in P$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] $P$ is closed under addition: if $u, v \in P$ then $u + v \in P$ (axiom O2 of [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a < b$; by the definition of the order this means $b - a \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.2 For every $c \in F$ the field identities give $(b + c) - (a + c) = b - a$. [algebra]

1.3 Assume moreover $c < d$; by the definition of the order this means $d - c \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.4 The field identities give $(b + d) - (a + c) = (b - a) + (d - c)$. [algebra]

2.1 Hence $(b + c) - (a + c) = b - a \in P$, which is exactly $a + c < b + c$, proving claim 1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1]

2.2 Since $b - a \in P$ and $d - c \in P$, closure under addition gives $(b - a) + (d - c) \in P$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, L2]

3.1 Therefore $(b + d) - (a + c) = (b - a) + (d - c) \in P$, which is exactly $a + c < b + d$, proving claim 2. [step 1.4, step 2.2, L1] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b \in F$.

1. If $a > 0$ then $a^{-1} > 0$.
2. If $0 < a < b$ then $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b \in F$.

[L1] $x > 0 \iff x \in P$; $x < 0 \iff -x \in P$; and for $x \neq 0$ exactly one of $x \in P$, $-x \in P$ holds ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Sign rules: a product of a positive and a negative is negative, a product of two positives is positive, and for $c > 0$ one has $a < b \iff ac < bc$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

[L3] $0 < 1$; in particular $1 \neq 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L4] $P$ is closed under addition, so $<$ is transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a > 0$, so $a \neq 0$ and its inverse $a^{-1}$ exists with $a \cdot a^{-1} = 1$; moreover $a^{-1} \neq 0$, since $a^{-1}$ has $a$ as its inverse while $0$ is non-invertible ($1 \neq 0$ by L3). [assume-hyp, L1, L3]

2.1 By trichotomy $a^{-1} \in P$ or $-a^{-1} \in P$; if $-a^{-1} \in P$, then $a > 0$ and $a^{-1} < 0$ give $a \cdot a^{-1} < 0$ by the sign rules, i.e. $1 < 0$, contradicting $0 < 1$; hence $a^{-1} \in P$, i.e. $a^{-1} > 0$, proving claim 1. [step 1.1, L2, L3, L1]

3.1 Assume $0 < a < b$; then $0 < b$ by transitivity, so by claim 1 both $a^{-1} > 0$ and $b^{-1} > 0$, and the sign rules give $a^{-1} b^{-1} > 0$. [assume-hyp, step 2.1, L4, L2, L1]

4.1 Multiplying $a < b$ by the positive $a^{-1} b^{-1}$ via the sign rules gives $a (a^{-1} b^{-1}) < b (a^{-1} b^{-1})$; since $a a^{-1} = 1$ and $b b^{-1} = 1$, this simplifies to $b^{-1} < a^{-1}$. [step 3.1, L2, algebra]

5.1 Together with $b^{-1} > 0$ from step 3.1, we conclude $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$, proving claim 2. [step 3.1, step 4.1] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field, with field structure as in [[def-field]], and for
$n \ge 1$ let $n \cdot 1_F$ denote the canonical natural number
$\underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$, defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$
and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$. Then for every $n \ge 1$:

- $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$;
- the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$;
- $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ and $(mn) \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F)$ for all $m, n \ge 1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ whose canonical naturals are defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, with $0 \cdot 1_F = 0$.

[L1] $0 < 1_F$ in every ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] The order is compatible with addition and positives are closed under addition: $a < b$ implies $a + c < b + c$, and $a > 0$, $b > 0$ imply $a + b > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 1$: by definition $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, and $1_F > 0$. [L1, base]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: assume $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for some fixed $n \ge 1$. [ih]

1.3 By the recursion, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F - n \cdot 1_F = 1_F > 0$, so $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$. [given, L1]

1.4 Additive identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ by the recursion, and if $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ then $(m+n+1) \cdot 1_F = (m+n) \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + (n+1) \cdot 1_F$. [given, algebra]

2.1 Inductive step: $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ is a sum of two positives, by the hypothesis and $1_F > 0$, hence $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Iterating 1.3, for $m < n$ one has $m \cdot 1_F < n \cdot 1_F$, so $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing and therefore injective on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$. [step 1.3, L2]

2.3 Multiplicative identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m \cdot 1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(1 \cdot 1_F)$, and the step $(m(n+1)) \cdot 1_F = (mn + m) \cdot 1_F = (mn) \cdot 1_F + m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F) + (m \cdot 1_F)(1_F) = (m \cdot 1_F)((n+1) \cdot 1_F)$ uses 1.4 and distributivity. [step 1.4, algebra]

3.1 By induction on 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for every $n \ge 1$; with the strict increase 2.2 and the identities 1.4, 2.3, every claim holds. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 1.4, step 2.3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$. Then

$$|x + y| \le |x| + |y|.$$

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and elements $x, y \in F$.

[L1] For every $u \in F$, $-|u| \le u \le |u|$, and $|u|$ equals $u$ or $-u$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L2] Order compatible with addition: if $a \le b$ and $c \le d$, then $a + c \le b + d$. [[lem-of-add-order]] states the STRICT forms and only those ($a < b \Rightarrow a + c < b + c$, and $a < b$ with $c < d$ giving $a + c < b + d$); the nonstrict form used here is those two together with the cases $a = b$ and $c = d$, settled by trichotomy, the order being total ([[def-ordered-field]]). Explicitly: if $a < b$ and $c < d$ the second strict form applies; if $a < b$ and $c = d$ the first gives $a + c < b + c = b + d$; if $a = b$ and $c < d$ the first gives $a + c < a + d = b + d$; and if $a = b$ and $c = d$ the two sides are equal.

[L3] Field and order arithmetic: $-(a + b) = -a + (-b)$, and $a \le b \iff -b \le -a$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L1], $-|x| \le x \le |x|$ and $-|y| \le y \le |y|$. [L1]

2.1 Adding the two chains of [step 1.1] with [L2] and using $-(|x| + |y|) = -|x| + (-|y|)$ from [L3] gives $-(|x| + |y|) \le x + y \le |x| + |y|$. [step 1.1, L2, L3]

3.1 By [L1] the value $|x + y|$ equals $x + y$ or $-(x + y)$; both $x + y \le |x| + |y|$ and $-(x + y) \le |x| + |y|$ hold by [step 2.1] and [L3] (the latter from $-(|x| + |y|) \le x + y$), so $|x + y| \le |x| + |y|$. [step 2.1, L1, L3] ∎

This page fixes a handful of conventions. None of them is deep, and each is the
kind of thing that silently causes trouble when it is left implicit.

**Indexing from $0$ or from $1$ makes no difference to convergence.** Sequences
here are functions on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[def-sequence]]), and $\mathbb{N}$ contains
$0$, so the first term is $x_0$. A text that writes $(x_k)_{k \ge 1}$ is
describing the first tail of such a function. By [[lem-limit-of-tail]] a sequence
and any of its tails converge to exactly the same limits and are Cauchy together,
so every statement on this page about convergence, about limits and about the
Cauchy condition reads the same under a shift of the indexing. That is a claim
about those statements and not about every sentence here: the starting index is
genuinely visible wherever an index is named, as in the base case $n_0 \ge 0$ of
[[lem-index-map-grows]], in the $0$-th tail used in the proof of
[[lem-limit-of-tail]], and in the recursion $s_0 = 1$ that builds the witness of
[[fs-bounded-implies-convergent]]. In a formula it shows up as the shift in
$1/(k+1)$, written that way here purely so that no term is undefined at $k = 0$.

**"Eventually" is the only weakened quantifier pattern used for hypotheses.** A
property holds eventually when it holds for all indices from some point on, and
frequently when, for every index $K$, it holds at some index $k \ge K$
([[def-sequence]]). The two are negations of each other applied to the
complementary property: $P$ holds frequently exactly when $\lnot P$ does not hold
eventually. "Frequently" is *defined* in that cofinal form, and the cofinal form
is what every use of the word here means, because it is the literal negation of
"eventually" and needs nothing further. The familiar reading "at infinitely many
indices" is equivalent to it, and the equivalence is available in this library
rather than merely plausible: finiteness is defined ([[def-countable]]),
[[lem-subset-of-countable]] proves that a subset of $\mathbb{N}$ is finite when
it is bounded above and countably infinite when it is not, and
[[lem-pigeonhole]] proves that $\mathbb{N}$ is equinumerous with no natural
number, so those two cases exclude one another. A set of indices is therefore
cofinal exactly when it is infinite. The cofinal form is nevertheless the one
taken as the definition here, because it is the literal negation of "eventually"
and calls on no counting theory at all. Because of [[lem-limit-of-tail]], a
hypothesis of the form "for all $k$"
whose conclusion concerns only convergence may be weakened to "eventually" at no
cost, and two of the three hypotheses of that shape on this page are stated in
the weaker form: the comparison $x_k \le y_k$ of [[lem-limit-preserves-order]]
and the bracketing $a_k \le x_k \le b_k$ of [[thm-squeeze]]. The third is
deliberately left at every index, the strict comparison $x_k < y_k$ of
[[fs-limit-preserves-strict-inequality]]: that claim is false, and stating its
hypothesis at every index makes it as strong as it can be, so that the refutation
defeats the strongest form rather than a weakened one. The remaining hypotheses
are stated at every index because they are not of that shape. Some are needed at
every index for the statement to typecheck at all, such as $y_k \ne 0$ in
[[thm-algebra-of-limits]] and $x_k > 0$ in [[lem-reciprocal-of-null-diverges]],
where a missing index would leave $1/y_k$ or $1/x_k$ undefined; and the bound
$|y_k| \le M$ of [[lem-null-times-bounded]] is not weakened because, as recorded
there, an eventual bound is already a bound. "Frequently" is defined here for
completeness and is used in no hypothesis on this page.

**$\lim$ is written only after uniqueness is known.** The notation $\lim_k x_k$
presupposes that at most one real can be the limit, which is
[[lem-limit-unique]]. Before that lemma, the correct phrasing is "$(x_k)$
converges to $x$", a relation between a sequence and a real, not a function of
the sequence. The same discipline is applied to $\sup$ and $\inf$ elsewhere in
the library ([[rem-sup-conventions]]): a notation is introduced only once the
object it names has been shown to exist and to be unique.

**Convergence is tested against rational $\varepsilon$.** The published
[[def-real-limit]] quantifies over rational $\varepsilon > 0$ rather than real
$\varepsilon > 0$. That is a deliberate feature of the construction of
$\mathbb{R}$, where the rationals are available before the reals are complete,
and it loses nothing: below any real $\eta > 0$ lies a positive rational
([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), so the two formulations define the same relation. The
argument is written out once, in the remarks of [[def-sequence]], and proofs on
this page cite it whenever a real $\varepsilon$ is more convenient than a
rational one. Rationals are identified with their images in $\mathbb{R}$ under
the ordered-field embedding, again as recorded in [[def-sequence]].

**A sequence is not its range, but boundedness only sees the range.** $(x_k)$ is
a function; the set $\{x_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$ forgets order and multiplicity.
The sequence is bounded, in the sense of [[def-sequence]], exactly when its range
is a bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}$ in the sense of [[def-bounded-set]]. Both
directions rest on the equivalence $|x| \le M \iff -M \le x \le M$: if
$|x| \le M$ then $x \le |x| \le M$ and $-M \le -|x| \le x$, using
$-|x| \le x \le |x|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]) together with the fact that
$a \le b$ and $-b \le -a$ are the same assertion, both saying that $b - a$ is
positive or zero ([[def-ordered-field]]); conversely, if $-M \le x \le M$ then
$|x|$, being $x$ or $-x$ by the definition of the absolute value
([[def-real-order]], [[def-abs-value]]), is $\le M$ either way. Given a
bound $M$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for all $k$, the range is bounded below by $-M$ and
above by $M$. Conversely, given $\ell \le x_k \le u$ for all $k$, put
$M := \max\{|\ell|, |u|\}$, which exists because a nonempty finite list of reals
has a maximum ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]); then
$x_k \le u \le |u| \le M$ and $-M \le -|\ell| \le \ell \le x_k$, so
$-M \le x_k \le M$ and hence $|x_k| \le M$ for every $k$, by transitivity of
$\le$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

Boundedness is not alone in this. Any property of $(x_k)$ that is defined purely
from the set of values is settled by the range for the same trivial reason:
bounded above, bounded below, and the supremum or infimum of the range when it
exists ([[def-bounded-set]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]) are read off the
range by definition, so permuting or repeating terms cannot change them.
**Convergence is not of that kind**, and that is the contrast worth drawing: the
sequence $z_0 = -1$ with $z_k = 1$ for $k \ge 1$ and the alternating sequence of
[[fs-bounded-implies-convergent]] have the *same* range $\{-1, 1\}$, yet the
first converges to $1$, being constant from index $1$ on ([[def-sequence]],
[[lem-limit-of-tail]]), while the second does not converge at all. So knowing the
range settles boundedness and does not settle convergence. That is the whole of
what is claimed here; each other property of a sequence has to be looked at on
its own, and this page does not survey them.

**"Diverges" means "does not converge".** Divergence is the plain negation of
convergence, so an oscillating bounded sequence diverges. Divergence *to*
$+\infty$ or $-\infty$ ([[def-divergence-to-infinity]]) is a strictly stronger
and entirely separate condition, and the arrow in $x_k \to +\infty$ is an
abbreviation, not an equation: this library never writes $\lim_k x_k = +\infty$,
because $+\infty$ is not a real number.

**What is deliberately absent from this page.** Monotone sequences, the monotone
convergence theorem, the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem and the completeness of
$\mathbb{R}$ in the Cauchy sense are none of them treated here. They are the
subject of the next page of this track, *Monotone Sequences,
Bolzano-Weierstrass, and Cauchy Completeness*, which comes later in the reading
order; nothing on this page may be taken to have proved any of
them. The last of the four is the one exception worth stating: for the
$\mathbb{R}$ this page works in, every Cauchy sequence of reals converges to a
real is already proved elsewhere in the library, by
[[thm-reals-cauchy-complete]] on the Cauchy-construction page, and
[[lem-convergent-implies-cauchy]] records where that leaves the two directions.
The monotone convergence theorem and the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem have no such
exception: neither is available at this point in the reading order, and both are
proved on that next page.
**How far this page is really a page about $\mathbb{R}$.** It assumes only that
$\mathbb{R}$ is a complete ordered field, and it uses completeness solely through
the Archimedean property. It is tempting to conclude that every result here holds
verbatim for sequences of rationals, and the earlier version of this remark said
exactly that. The claim needs splitting in two, because it is true of the
statements and not literally true of the proofs.

The statements do transfer. $\mathbb{Q}$ is an ordered field
([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and is Archimedean ([[lem-rat-archimedean]]), and the
absolute value, the triangle inequality and the order arithmetic these proofs run
on are established for an arbitrary ordered field, not for $\mathbb{R}$ in
particular ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[lem-of-triangle-inequality]],
[[def-ordered-field]]).

The proofs do not transfer by citation, and two places are why.
[[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]] absorbs the first finitely many terms using
[[lem-finite-set-has-max]], which is stated for finite lists of **reals**; its
proof is an induction that runs in any totally ordered field, but as stated it
does not apply to $\mathbb{Q}$. And [[thm-of-archimedean]] is stated for
**complete** ordered fields, so it says nothing about $\mathbb{Q}$; the
$\mathbb{Q}$ counterpart is the separately proved [[lem-rat-archimedean]]. A
third, more basic point: this library defines convergence and the Cauchy
condition only for sequences of reals ([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]), so
the rational statements are not formulated anywhere here in the first place.

What is therefore claimed, and all that is claimed, is this: rerun any argument on
this page over $\mathbb{Q}$, replacing the maximum lemma by the same induction in
$\mathbb{Q}$ and [[thm-of-archimedean]] by [[lem-rat-archimedean]], and it goes
through unchanged. That is a statement about the arguments, not a licence to cite
the items above with $\mathbb{Q}$ in place of $\mathbb{R}$.

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ be sequences of reals ([[def-sequence]]) converging to
$x$ and $y$ respectively ([[def-real-limit]]), and let $c \in \mathbb{R}$. Then

$$x_k + y_k \to x + y, \qquad c\,x_k \to c\,x, \qquad x_k - y_k \to x - y, \qquad x_k y_k \to x y,$$

and if in addition $y \ne 0$ and $y_k \ne 0$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, then

$$\frac{1}{y_k} \to \frac{1}{y} \qquad \text{and} \qquad \frac{x_k}{y_k} \to \frac{x}{y}.$$

The quotient case rests on an eventual lower bound for $|y_k|$, proved below
rather than assumed: $|y_k| > |y|/2$ for all sufficiently large $k$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $(x_k)$, $(y_k)$ of reals with $(x_k)$ converging to $x$ and $(y_k)$ converging to $y$, and a real $c$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]). For the last two claims we assume in addition $y \ne 0$ and $y_k \ne 0$ for every $k$.

[L1] Convergence, quantified over rational $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-real-limit]]).

[L2] Absolute value and the triangle inequality: $|uv| = |u|\,|v|$, $|u| \ge 0$, $|u| = 0$ if and only if $u = 0$, $|-u| = |u|$, and $|a + b| \le |a| + |b|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L3] Real versus rational $\varepsilon$: for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, by density ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) or by the Archimedean property ([[thm-of-archimedean]]) applied to $1/\eta$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]); consequently the convergence test of [[def-real-limit]] may equivalently be run with real $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-sequence]]).

[L4] Convergent sequences are bounded ([[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]]), and a constant sequence $(c)$ is bounded by $|c|$ ([[def-sequence]]).

[L5] A null sequence times a bounded sequence is null ([[lem-null-times-bounded]]).

[L6] Reverse triangle inequality: $\bigl||u| - |v|\bigr| \le |u - v|$, hence $|u| \ge |v| - |v - u|$ ([[cor-of-reverse-triangle]]).

[L7] Inverses and order: $a > 0$ implies $a^{-1} > 0$; $0 < a < b$ implies $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$; $(u^{-1})^{-1} = u$ for $u \ne 0$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-field]]).

[L8] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: adding a constant and adding inequalities preserve the order, multiplying a strict inequality by a positive factor preserves it, and $\le$ and $<$ compose transitively; trichotomy holds, and since $u \ge 0$ means $u > 0$ or $u = 0$, an element with $u \ge 0$ and $u \ne 0$ satisfies $u > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]). Moreover $2 = 1 + 1 > 0$ and $2$ is invertible: $0 < 1$ in any ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]) and the positives are closed under addition, so $2 > 0$ and in particular $2 \ne 0$ ([[def-ordered-field]]), whence $2^{-1}$ exists ([[def-field]]).

[L9] Rational arithmetic: $\varepsilon/2$ is a rational $> 0$ whenever $\varepsilon$ is, and $\varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$ ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]); the order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total, so finitely many thresholds admit a common index ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Reduction to null sequences: for any sequence $(z_k)$ of reals and any real $z$, the statements "$(z_k)$ converges to $z$" and "$(z_k - z)$ converges to $0$" are literally the same condition, because $|(z_k - z) - 0| = |z_k - z|$ for every $k$. [L1, L2]

1.2 Sum rule, in general form. Let $(u_k) \to u$ and $(v_k) \to v$ be any convergent sequences of reals and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be rational; take $K_1$ with $|u_k - u| < \varepsilon/2$ for $k \ge K_1$ and $K_2$ with $|v_k - v| < \varepsilon/2$ for $k \ge K_2$, and let $K$ be an index at least as large as both. For $k \ge K$, $|(u_k + v_k) - (u + v)| = |(u_k - u) + (v_k - v)| \le |u_k - u| + |v_k - v| < \varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$; hence $u_k + v_k \to u + v$, and in particular $x_k + y_k \to x + y$. [L1, L2, L8, L9, algebra]

1.3 Boundedness: every convergent sequence of reals is bounded, and every constant sequence $(d)$ is bounded by $|d|$. [L4]

1.4 Quotient preparation. Assume $y \ne 0$ and $y_k \ne 0$ for every $k$. Then $|y| > 0$ by [L2], so $|y|/2 > 0$; running the convergence test of $(y_k)$ with the real number $|y|/2$ as tolerance, which [L3] licenses, produces $K_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|y_k - y| < |y|/2$ for all $k \ge K_0$. [L1, L2, L3, L7, L8, choose]

2.1 Scalar rule, in general form. Let $(u_k) \to u$ and let $d \in \mathbb{R}$. By step 1.1 the sequence $(u_k - u)$ is null and by step 1.3 the constant sequence $(d)$ is bounded, so $(d(u_k - u)) = (d u_k - d u)$ is null by [L5]; by step 1.1 again, $d u_k \to d u$, and in particular $c x_k \to c x$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, L5, algebra]

2.2 Product rule, in general form. Let $(u_k) \to u$ and $(v_k) \to v$, and write $u_k v_k - u v = u_k(v_k - v) + v(u_k - u)$. By step 1.1 both $(v_k - v)$ and $(u_k - u)$ are null; by step 1.3 both $(u_k)$ and the constant sequence $(v)$ are bounded; so both $(u_k(v_k - v))$ and $(v(u_k - u))$ are null by [L5], and their sum is null by step 1.2 applied with both limits equal to $0$. By step 1.1, $u_k v_k \to u v$, and in particular $x_k y_k \to x y$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, L5, algebra]

2.3 Eventual lower bound. For every $k \ge K_0$, the reverse triangle inequality gives $|y_k| \ge |y| - |y - y_k| = |y| - |y_k - y| > |y| - |y|/2 = |y|/2 > 0$; so $|y_k| > |y|/2$ for all $k \ge K_0$, and in particular $|y_k| \ne 0$ there. [step 1.4, L2, L6, L8]

3.1 Difference rule. Applying step 2.1 to the sequence $(y_k)$ with $d = -1$ gives $-y_k \to -y$; the sum rule of step 1.2 applied to $(x_k)$ and $(-y_k)$ then gives $x_k - y_k = x_k + (-y_k) \to x + (-y) = x - y$. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L8, algebra]

3.2 Reciprocal estimate. For $k \ge K_0$ we have $y_k \ne 0$ and $|y_k| > |y|/2 > 0$, so [L7] applied to $0 < |y|/2 < |y_k|$ gives $0 < |y_k|^{-1} < 2/|y|$, and therefore $\left|\dfrac{1}{y_k} - \dfrac{1}{y}\right| = \dfrac{|y - y_k|}{|y_k|\,|y|} \le \dfrac{2}{|y|^2}\,|y_k - y|$. [step 2.3, L2, L7, L8, algebra]

4.1 Reciprocal rule. Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real and put $\eta := \varepsilon |y|^2/2$, a real $> 0$; by [L3] there is $K_1$ with $|y_k - y| < \eta$ for all $k \ge K_1$. For every $k$ at least as large as both $K_0$ and $K_1$, step 3.2 gives $\left|\dfrac{1}{y_k} - \dfrac{1}{y}\right| \le \dfrac{2}{|y|^2}|y_k - y| < \dfrac{2}{|y|^2}\,\eta = \varepsilon$; hence $1/y_k \to 1/y$. [step 3.2, L1, L3, L7, L8, L9, algebra]

5.1 Quotient rule. By step 4.1 the sequence $(1/y_k)$ converges to $1/y$, so the product rule of step 2.2 applied to $(x_k)$ and $(1/y_k)$ gives $x_k/y_k = x_k \cdot (1/y_k) \to x \cdot (1/y) = x/y$. [step 2.2, step 4.1, algebra]

6.1 All the claims are established: the sum rule in step 1.2, the scalar rule in step 2.1, the difference rule in step 3.1, the product rule in step 2.2, and the reciprocal and quotient rules in steps 4.1 and 5.1. [step 1.2, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, step 4.1, step 5.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The quotient case is where proofs usually cheat.** The estimate $|1/y_k - 1/y| = |y - y_k| / (|y_k||y|)$ is worthless until $|y_k|$ is known to stay away from $0$: without a lower bound the denominator can be arbitrarily small and the fraction arbitrarily large, even while $|y - y_k|$ shrinks. Step 2.3 supplies that bound, $|y_k| > |y|/2$ for $k \ge K_0$, and it is proved from the reverse triangle inequality, not assumed.

- The hypothesis $y_k \ne 0$ for every $k$ is only there so that $1/y_k$ is defined for every index. It is not needed for the limit: step 2.3 shows $|y_k| > |y|/2 > 0$ from $K_0$ on, so a sequence with $y \ne 0$ has at most finitely many zero terms, and by [[lem-limit-of-tail]] one may pass to the $K_0$-th tail and read the conclusion there.

- The hypothesis $y \ne 0$ cannot be dropped. With $x_k = 1$ and $y_k = 1/(k+1)$, both sequences converge: the first is constant ([[def-sequence]]) and the second is null ([[fs-limit-preserves-strict-inequality]]), so $y = 0$. Yet $x_k/y_k = k+1$, and no real $M$ bounds every $k+1$, by the Archimedean property ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); so the quotient sequence is unbounded, hence not convergent by [[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]].

- Nothing in the proof uses completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ beyond the Archimedean property invoked in [L3], so the same rules hold verbatim for sequences of rationals.

## Statement

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. If $0 \in S$ and $\sigma(n) \in S$ whenever $n \in S$, then $S = \mathbb{N}$. Equivalently (property form): if a property $P$ satisfies $P(0)$ and ($P(n) \Rightarrow P(\sigma(n))$) for all $n$, then $P(n)$ holds for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. This is the induction principle, the basis of proof by induction.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $\mathbb{N} = \omega$ is the smallest inductive set ([[def-inductive-set]], [[def-natural-numbers]], [[lem-omega-smallest-inductive]]); $0 = \varnothing$, $\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$.

[L1] $\omega$ is contained in every inductive set ([[lem-omega-smallest-inductive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Suppose $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ with $0 = \varnothing \in S$ and ($x \in S \Rightarrow \sigma(x) = x \cup \{x\} \in S$). [given]

2.1 Then $S$ contains $\varnothing$ and is closed under $x \mapsto x \cup \{x\}$, so $S$ is an inductive set. [step 1.1]

3.1 $\mathbb{N} = \omega \subseteq S$ because $\omega$ is a subset of every inductive set. [L1, step 2.1]

4.1 With $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ by hypothesis, $S = \mathbb{N}$. [step 3.1, given]

5.1 The property form is the set case with $S = \{n \in \mathbb{N} : P(n)\}$: $P(0)$ and $P(n) \Rightarrow P(\sigma(n))$ give $0 \in S$ and $\sigma$-closure, so $S = \mathbb{N}$, i.e. $P$ holds for all $n$; conversely the set form is the property form applied to $P(n) :\equiv n \in S$, so the two are equivalent.

## Statement

The relation $\le$ on $\mathbb{N}$, where $m \le n \iff \exists k\ (m + k = n)$ ([[def-nat-order]]), is a linear (total) order: reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive, and total.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The order $m \le n \iff \exists k\ (m + k = n)$ ([[def-nat-order]]) and addition with $m + 0 = m$, $m + \sigma(n) = \sigma(m + n)$ ([[def-nat-addition]]).

[L1] $0 + k = k$ and addition is associative ([[lem-nat-add-identity]], [[lem-nat-add-associative]]).

[L2] Cancellation: $m + k = n + k \Rightarrow m = n$ ([[lem-nat-add-cancellative]]).

[L3] Every nonzero natural is a successor: if $j \ne 0$ then $j = \sigma(i)$ for some $i$ ([[lem-nat-nonzero-is-successor]]).

[L4] Trichotomy: exactly one of $m < n$, $m = n$, $m > n$ holds ([[lem-nat-trichotomy]]).

[L5] Addition is commutative ([[lem-nat-add-commutative]]).

[L6] $\sigma(x) \ne 0$ for every $x$ (Peano axiom P1) ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Reflexive: $m + 0 = m$, so $m \le m$. [given]

1.2 Transitive: if $m \le n$ and $n \le p$, say $m + k = n$ and $n + j = p$, then $m + (k + j) = (m + k) + j = n + j = p$, so $m \le p$. [given, L1]

1.3 A sum is zero only if both summands are: if $k + j = 0$ with $j \ne 0$ then $j = \sigma(i)$ and $k + j = k + \sigma(i) = \sigma(k + i) \ne 0$ [L6], a contradiction, so $k = j = 0$. [L1, L3, L6]

1.4 Total: by trichotomy one of $m < n$, $m = n$, $m > n$ holds, and each of these gives $m \le n$ or $n \le m$. [L4]

2.1 Antisymmetric: if $m \le n$ and $n \le m$, say $m + k = n$ and $n + j = m$, then $m + (k + j) = (m + k) + j = n + j = m = m + 0$; commuting both sides [L5] gives $(k + j) + m = 0 + m$, and cancelling the common right summand $m$ [L2] gives $k + j = 0$, hence $k = j = 0$ by step 1.3 and $m = n$. [given, L1, L2, L5, step 1.3]

3.1 Reflexivity, antisymmetry, transitivity, and totality all hold, so $\le$ is a linear order on $\mathbb{N}$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.1, step 1.4] ∎
