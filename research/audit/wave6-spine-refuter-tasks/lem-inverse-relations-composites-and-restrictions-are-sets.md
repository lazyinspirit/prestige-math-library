## Statement

Let $R$ and $S$ be relations and $A$ a set. Then each of

$$\{\,(b,a) : (a,b) \in R\,\}, \qquad \{\,(a,c) : \exists b\ ((a,b) \in R \wedge (b,c) \in S)\,\}, \qquad \{\,(a,b) \in R : a \in A\,\}$$

is a set; the first is included in
$\operatorname{ran} R \times \operatorname{dom} R$, the second in
$\operatorname{dom} R \times \operatorname{ran} S$, and the third in $R$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** relations $R$ and $S$ and a set $A$.

[L1] A **relation** is a set $R$ every element of which is an ordered pair ([[def-relation-domain-range-and-field]]).

[L2] $\operatorname{dom} R := \{\, a : \exists b\ (a,b) \in R \,\}, \qquad \operatorname{ran} R := \{\, b : \exists a\ (a,b) \in R \,\}$ ([[def-relation-domain-range-and-field]]).

[L3] $z \in A \times B$ holds if and only if $z = (a,b)$ for some $a \in A$ and some $b \in B$ ([[def-cartesian-product]]).

[L4] For any parameters $\bar p$ and any set $x$, there is a set $y$ whose elements are exactly the elements $z$ of $x$ for which $\varphi(z,\bar p)$ holds ([[def-axiom-schema-of-separation]]).

[L5] $R \subseteq \operatorname{dom} R \times \operatorname{ran} R$ ([[lem-a-relation-is-included-in-the-product-of-its-domain-and-range]]).

[L6] $x \subseteq y$ means that every element of $x$ is an element of $y$ ([[def-subset-and-proper-subset]]).

[L7] $(a,b) := \{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$ ([[def-ordered-pair]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 If $(a,b) \in R$ then $a \in \operatorname{dom} R$ and $b \in \operatorname{ran} R$, so $(b,a) \in \operatorname{ran} R \times \operatorname{dom} R$; separating inside that product with the formula $\exists a\,\exists b\,(z = (b,a) \wedge (a,b) \in R)$ and the parameter $R$ therefore yields exactly the first collection. [L2, L3, L4, L6, L7]

1.2 If $(a,b) \in R$ and $(b,c) \in S$ then $a \in \operatorname{dom} R$ and $c \in \operatorname{ran} S$, so $(a,c) \in \operatorname{dom} R \times \operatorname{ran} S$; separating inside that product with the formula $\exists a\,\exists c\,\bigl(z = (a,c) \wedge \exists b\,((a,b) \in R \wedge (b,c) \in S)\bigr)$ and the parameters $R$ and $S$ yields exactly the second collection. [L2, L3, L4, L6, L7]

1.3 The third collection consists of elements of $R$, and separating inside $R$ with the formula $\exists a\,\exists b\,(z = (a,b) \wedge a \in A)$ and the parameters $A$ and $R$ yields exactly it; every element of $R$ is an ordered pair, so the formula selects the intended pairs. [L1, L4, L5, L6, L7]

2.1 All three collections are therefore sets, with the stated inclusions. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3] ∎

## Definition

Let $\varphi(z, \bar p)$ be a formula of the language of set theory
([[def-language-of-set-theory]]) in which the variable $y$ does not occur free.
The **Separation instance** for $\varphi$ is the sentence

$$\forall \bar p\,\forall x\,\exists y\,\forall z\,\bigl(z \in y \leftrightarrow (z \in x \wedge \varphi(z,\bar p))\bigr).$$

The **Axiom Schema of Separation** is the collection of all these sentences, one
for each such $\varphi$. In words: for any parameters $\bar p$ and any set $x$,
there is a set $y$ whose elements are exactly the elements $z$ of $x$ for which
$\varphi(z,\bar p)$ holds.

It is a schema and not a single axiom because $\varphi$ ranges over the formulas
of the language, of which there are infinitely many, and the language provides no
way to quantify over them.

## Remarks

- **The side condition is not decoration.** If $y$ were allowed to occur free in
  $\varphi$, the instance $\varphi(z,\bar p) := z \notin y$ would assert that
  some $y$ satisfies $z \in y \leftrightarrow (z \in x \wedge z \notin y)$ for
  every $z$, which is contradictory as soon as $x$ has a member. Requiring $y$ to
  be fresh is what keeps the schema consistent.

- **One parameter or a list.** Some presentations state the schema with a single
  parameter $p$ rather than a list $\bar p$; the two forms prove the same
  theorems, since a finite list can be coded once ordered pairs are available.
  The list form is used here because the instances below quantify over several
  sets at once.

- **A separated set is unique.** The instance is stated with $\leftrightarrow$,
  so any two sets it produces have the same elements and are equal by
  [[def-axiom-of-extensionality]]. That is what licenses the notation
  $\{\, z \in x : \varphi(z,\bar p) \,\}$ introduced at
  [[def-subset-and-proper-subset]].

## Definition

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. By
[[lem-ordered-pairs-lie-in-the-double-power-set]] every ordered pair $(a,b)$ with
$a \in A$ and $b \in B$ is an element of $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(A \cup B))$, so
[[def-axiom-schema-of-separation]] applied inside that set produces the
**Cartesian product**

$$A \times B := \{\, z \in \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(A \cup B)) : \exists a \in A\ \exists b \in B\ z = (a,b) \,\}.$$

Its elements are exactly the ordered pairs $(a,b)$ ([[def-ordered-pair]]) with
$a \in A$ and $b \in B$: no such pair is lost, because each such pair lies in
the ambient set being separated. Thus $z \in A \times B$ holds if and only if
$z = (a,b)$ for some $a \in A$ and some $b \in B$.

## Remarks

- **Why the ambient set is needed.** "The set of all ordered pairs with first
  coordinate in $A$ and second in $B$" is a class abbreviation, and no axiom
  turns a class abbreviation into a set on its own. The double power set is what
  supplies a set to separate inside, so the product costs
  [[def-axiom-of-power-set]] and [[def-axiom-of-union]] as well as Separation;
  [[rem-which-axiom-each-construction-uses]] keeps the account.

- **Products of nonempty sets.** Whether a product of *two* nonempty sets is
  nonempty is settled here, by exhibiting the pair
  ([[prop-cartesian-products-and-set-operations]]). The corresponding question
  for a product of an arbitrary indexed family of nonempty sets is not settled by
  the axioms on this page: it is one formulation of the Axiom of Choice, stated
  at [[def-axiom-of-choice]].

## Definition

For sets $a$ and $b$, the **ordered pair** $(a,b)$ is the set

$$(a,b) := \{\{a\},\{a,b\}\},$$

formed from the unordered pairs and singletons of
[[def-unordered-pair-and-singleton]]; three applications of
[[def-axiom-of-pairing]] produce it. The first coordinate is $a$ and the second
is $b$.

When $a = b$ the two members coincide, since $\{a,b\} = \{a,a\} = \{a\}$, and the
pair degenerates to $(a,a) = \{\{a\}\}$.

## Remarks

- **Why this set and not another.** An ordered pair is required to satisfy one
  property, that $(a,b) = (c,d)$ exactly when $a = c$ and $b = d$; that is
  [[thm-the-characterising-property-of-ordered-pairs]], and it is the only thing
  any later construction uses. Other definitions with the same property exist,
  and nothing below distinguishes them from this one.

- **The degenerate case is where a careless proof fails.** An argument that
  treats $\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$ as a set with two distinct members breaks at
  $a = b$, and that case has to be handled separately in the proof of the
  characterising property.

## Definition

A **relation** is a set $R$ every element of which is an ordered pair
([[def-ordered-pair]]). We write $a\,R\,b$ for $(a,b) \in R$.

By [[lem-the-domain-and-range-of-a-relation-are-sets]] the following two classes
are sets, so the notation is legitimate:

$$\operatorname{dom} R := \{\, a : \exists b\ (a,b) \in R \,\}, \qquad \operatorname{ran} R := \{\, b : \exists a\ (a,b) \in R \,\},$$

the **domain** and the **range** of $R$. The **field** of $R$ is
$\operatorname{fld} R := \operatorname{dom} R \cup \operatorname{ran} R$
([[def-union-of-a-set-and-binary-union]]).

$R$ is a **relation from $A$ to $B$** when $R \subseteq A \times B$
([[def-cartesian-product]], [[def-subset-and-proper-subset]]), and a **relation
on $A$** when $R \subseteq A \times A$.

## Remarks

- **Domain and range are intrinsic; the sets $A$ and $B$ are not.** A relation
  determines its own domain and range, but it is a relation from $A$ to $B$ for
  many different $A$ and $B$: any $A$ containing $\operatorname{dom} R$ and any
  $B$ containing $\operatorname{ran} R$ will do. That is the content of
  [[lem-a-relation-is-included-in-the-product-of-its-domain-and-range]], and it
  is the same distinction that makes a codomain part of the declaration
  $f : A \to B$ rather than of the set $f$ in [[def-function]].

- **The empty set is a relation.** It has no elements, so the requirement that
  every element be an ordered pair holds vacuously, and
  $\operatorname{dom} \varnothing = \operatorname{ran} \varnothing = \varnothing$.
  It is a relation on every set.

## Definition

For sets $x$ and $y$ we write $x \subseteq y$, and say that $x$ is a **subset**
of $y$ or that $x$ is **included** in $y$, for the formula
$\forall t\,(t \in x \to t \in y)$ of the language of set theory
([[def-language-of-set-theory]]); thus $x \subseteq y$ means that every element
of $x$ is an element of $y$. We also write $y \supseteq x$ for $x \subseteq y$.

$x$ is a **proper subset** of $y$, written $x \subsetneq y$, when $x \subseteq y$
and $x \neq y$.

**Separation notation.** Let $x$ be a set, $\varphi(z,\bar p)$ a formula and
$\bar p$ parameters. [[def-axiom-schema-of-separation]] supplies a set whose
elements are exactly the elements $z$ of $x$ for which $\varphi(z,\bar p)$ holds,
and [[def-axiom-of-extensionality]] shows there is only one such set. It is
written

$$\{\, z \in x : \varphi(z,\bar p) \,\}$$

and every set introduced on this page by separating a condition inside a set
already in hand is written this way. Directly from the definition,
$\{\, z \in x : \varphi(z,\bar p) \,\} \subseteq x$.

## Remarks

- **$\subset$ is not used in this library.** Sources disagree about it: some write
  $\subset$ for inclusion and some for proper inclusion, so a formula containing
  it cannot be read without knowing which convention its author used.
  $\subseteq$ and $\subsetneq$ are unambiguous and are the only two symbols used
  here.

- **Membership and inclusion are different relations.** $t \in x$ says $t$ is one
  of the elements of $x$; $t \subseteq x$ says every element of $t$ is an element
  of $x$. Neither implies the other in general, and
  [[prop-basic-properties-of-the-power-set]] is where the two are systematically
  related.

## Statement

Let $R$ be a relation and let $A$ and $B$ be sets. Then

- (i) $R \subseteq \operatorname{dom} R \times \operatorname{ran} R$;
- (ii) $R \subseteq A \times B$ if and only if $\operatorname{dom} R \subseteq A$ and $\operatorname{ran} R \subseteq B$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** a relation $R$ and sets $A$, $B$.

[L1] A **relation** is a set $R$ every element of which is an ordered pair ([[def-relation-domain-range-and-field]]).

[L2] $\operatorname{dom} R := \{\, a : \exists b\ (a,b) \in R \,\}, \qquad \operatorname{ran} R := \{\, b : \exists a\ (a,b) \in R \,\}$ ([[def-relation-domain-range-and-field]]).

[L3] $z \in A \times B$ holds if and only if $z = (a,b)$ for some $a \in A$ and some $b \in B$ ([[def-cartesian-product]]).

[L4] $(a,b) = (c,d)$ if and only if $a = c$ and $b = d$ ([[thm-the-characterising-property-of-ordered-pairs]]).

[L5] $x \subseteq y$ means that every element of $x$ is an element of $y$ ([[def-subset-and-proper-subset]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Claim (i): let $z \in R$. Since $R$ is a relation, $z = (a,b)$ for some sets $a$ and $b$; then $a \in \operatorname{dom} R$ and $b \in \operatorname{ran} R$ by the defining conditions, so $z \in \operatorname{dom} R \times \operatorname{ran} R$. [L1, L2, L3, L5]

1.2 Claim (ii), from left to right: assume $R \subseteq A \times B$. If $a \in \operatorname{dom} R$ then $(a,b) \in R$ for some $b$, so $(a,b) \in A \times B$, so $(a,b) = (a',b')$ with $a' \in A$ and $b' \in B$, and the characterising property gives $a = a' \in A$. The argument for $\operatorname{ran} R \subseteq B$ is the same on the second coordinate. [L2, L3, L4, L5]

1.3 Claim (ii), from right to left: assume $\operatorname{dom} R \subseteq A$ and $\operatorname{ran} R \subseteq B$, and let $z \in R$. Then $z = (a,b)$ with $a \in \operatorname{dom} R \subseteq A$ and $b \in \operatorname{ran} R \subseteq B$, so $z \in A \times B$. [L1, L2, L3, L5]

2.1 Claims (i) and (ii) are established, which is the statement. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3] ∎
