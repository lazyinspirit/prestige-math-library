## Statement

For all sets $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$: $(a,b) = (c,d)$ if and only if $a = c$ and
$b = d$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** sets $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$.

[L1] $(a,b) := \{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$ ([[def-ordered-pair]]).

[L2] $\{x,y\}$ is the set whose elements are exactly $x$ and $y$, and $\{x\} := \{x,x\}$ ([[def-unordered-pair-and-singleton]]).

[L3] $\{a,b\} = \{c,d\} \ \leftrightarrow\ \bigl((a = c \wedge b = d) \vee (a = d \wedge b = c)\bigr)$ ([[lem-unordered-pair-equality]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Right to left: if $a = c$ and $b = d$ then $\{a\} = \{c\}$ and $\{a,b\} = \{c,d\}$, so $\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$ and $\{\{c\},\{c,d\}\}$ are the same set, that is $(a,b) = (c,d)$. [L1, L2]

1.2 Left to right, setting up: assume $\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\} = \{\{c\},\{c,d\}\}$. Applying the equality criterion for unordered pairs to these two sets, either $\{a\} = \{c\}$ and $\{a,b\} = \{c,d\}$, or $\{a\} = \{c,d\}$ and $\{a,b\} = \{c\}$. [L1, L3]

2.1 In the first alternative, $\{a\} = \{c\}$ reads $\{a,a\} = \{c,c\}$ and gives $a = c$. Then $\{a,b\} = \{c,d\}$ gives $a = c$ and $b = d$, or $a = d$ and $b = c$; in the second of these $b = c = a = d$, so $b = d$ holds as well. Either way $a = c$ and $b = d$. [assume-case first, step 1.2, L2, L3]

2.2 In the second alternative, $\{a,b\} = \{c\}$ reads $\{a,b\} = \{c,c\}$ and gives $a = c$ and $b = c$, while $\{a\} = \{c,d\}$ reads $\{a,a\} = \{c,d\}$ and gives $a = c$ and $a = d$. Hence $a = c$ and $b = c = a = d$. [assume-case second, step 1.2, L2, L3]

3.1 The two alternatives supplied by step 1.2 are exhaustive, so the left-to-right implication holds. [step 2.1, step 2.2, cases-exhaustive]

4.1 Both implications hold, which is the statement. [step 1.1, step 3.1] ∎

## Definition

For sets $a$ and $b$, the **ordered pair** $(a,b)$ is the set

$$(a,b) := \{\{a\},\{a,b\}\},$$

formed from the unordered pairs and singletons of
[[def-unordered-pair-and-singleton]]; three applications of
[[def-axiom-of-pairing]] produce it. The first coordinate is $a$ and the second
is $b$.

When $a = b$ the two members coincide, since $\{a,b\} = \{a,a\} = \{a\}$, and the
pair degenerates to $(a,a) = \{\{a\}\}$.

## Remarks

- **Why this set and not another.** An ordered pair is required to satisfy one
  property, that $(a,b) = (c,d)$ exactly when $a = c$ and $b = d$; that is
  [[thm-the-characterising-property-of-ordered-pairs]], and it is the only thing
  any later construction uses. Other definitions with the same property exist,
  and nothing below distinguishes them from this one.

- **The degenerate case is where a careless proof fails.** An argument that
  treats $\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$ as a set with two distinct members breaks at
  $a = b$, and that case has to be handled separately in the proof of the
  characterising property.

## Definition

Let $x$ and $y$ be sets. [[def-axiom-of-pairing]] gives a set whose elements are
exactly $x$ and $y$, and [[def-axiom-of-extensionality]] shows there is only one
such set; it is written $\{x,y\}$. Thus $\{x,y\}$ is the set whose elements are
exactly $x$ and $y$, and $\{x\} := \{x,x\}$, the **singleton** of $x$, is the set
whose only element is $x$:

$$t \in \{x,y\} \leftrightarrow (t = x \vee t = y), \qquad t \in \{x\} \leftrightarrow t = x .$$

## Remarks

- **The pair is unordered.** $t = x \vee t = y$ and $t = y \vee t = x$ are the
  same condition, so $\{x,y\} = \{y,x\}$, and the notation records no order.
  [[lem-unordered-pair-equality]] says exactly how much information a pair does
  carry, and [[def-ordered-pair]] is the construction that recovers an order from
  unordered pairs alone.

- **A singleton is not its element.** $\{x\}$ has exactly one element, namely
  $x$, and $x$ and $\{x\}$ are different sets whenever they have different
  elements; $\{\varnothing\}$ has one element while $\varnothing$ has none, so
  the two are already distinct at the bottom of the hierarchy.

## Statement

For all sets $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$:

$$\{a,b\} = \{c,d\} \ \leftrightarrow\ \bigl((a = c \wedge b = d) \vee (a = d \wedge b = c)\bigr).$$

In particular, taking $b := a$, $\{a\} = \{c,d\}$ if and only if $a = c$ and
$a = d$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** sets $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$.

[L1] $\{x,y\}$ is the set whose elements are exactly $x$ and $y$, and $\{x\} := \{x,x\}$ ([[def-unordered-pair-and-singleton]]).

[L2] If every $z$ satisfies $z \in x$ if and only if $z \in y$, then $x = y$ ([[def-axiom-of-extensionality]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Right to left: if $a = c$ and $b = d$, or $a = d$ and $b = c$, then for every $t$ the conditions "$t = a$ or $t = b$" and "$t = c$ or $t = d$" are the same, so the two pairs have the same elements and are equal. [L1, L2]

1.2 Left to right, setting up: assume $\{a,b\} = \{c,d\}$. Since $a$ and $b$ are elements of the left-hand set they are elements of the right-hand one, so $a$ is $c$ or $d$ and $b$ is $c$ or $d$; likewise $c$ is $a$ or $b$ and $d$ is $a$ or $b$. [L1]

2.1 Suppose $a = b$. Then $c$ is $a$ or $b$, so $c = a$; and $d$ is $a$ or $b$, so $d = a$. Hence $a = c$ and $b = a = d$, the first disjunct. [assume-case same, step 1.2]

2.2 Suppose instead $a \neq b$. If $a = c$, then $b$ is $c$ or $d$, and $b = c = a$ is excluded, so $b = d$ and the first disjunct holds. Otherwise $a = d$; then $c$ is $a$ or $b$, and $c = a$ would give $c = a = d$, whence $b$, being $c$ or $d$, equals $a$, contradicting $a \neq b$; so $c = b$ and the second disjunct holds. [assume-case diff, step 1.2]

3.1 The alternatives $a = b$ and $a \neq b$ exhaust the possibilities, so the left-to-right implication holds. [step 2.1, step 2.2, cases-exhaustive]

4.1 Both implications hold, which is the biconditional; putting $b := a$ makes the two disjuncts read "$a = c$ and $a = d$" and "$a = d$ and $a = c$", so $\{a\} = \{c,d\}$ if and only if $a = c$ and $a = d$. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L1] ∎
