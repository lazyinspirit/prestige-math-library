## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]) and let

$$D \;:=\; \{\, x \in [a,b] \ : \ f \text{ is discontinuous at } x \,\}$$

([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-classification-of-discontinuities]]). Then

$$f \text{ is Riemann integrable on } [a,b] \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad D \text{ has measure zero}$$

([[def-darboux-integral]], [[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

**The choice cost, named.** The implication from integrability to $D$ being null
uses the Axiom of Countable Choice ([[def-countable-choice]]) exactly once,
through [[thm-countable-union-of-null-is-null]] at step 7.1: $D$ is exhibited as
the union of a sequence of null sets. The converse implication, from $D$ null to
integrability, is a theorem of ZF: it uses no choice principle at all.

**"Measure zero" here is the cover condition of
[[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]**, namely that for every $\varepsilon > 0$
there is a sequence of intervals covering $D$ of total length at most
$\varepsilon$. No outer measure, no measurable set and no Lebesgue integral is
used or needed; the criterion is a statement about interval covers throughout.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, a bounded $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $M_{+} > 0$ with $|f(x)| \le M_{+}$ for every $x \in [a,b]$, and $D$ as in the Statement.

[A1] The Axiom of Countable Choice, used only where [L11] is invoked ([[def-countable-choice]]).

[L1] For a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[a,b]$: $n \ge 1$, $\Delta_i = t_{i+1}-t_i > 0$, $\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = b-a$, $I_i = [t_i,t_{i+1}] \subseteq [a,b]$, and appending a point $y > t_n$ to a partition of $[a,t_n]$ gives a partition of $[a,y]$ whose subintervals are the old ones together with $[t_n,y]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L2] $U(f,P) - L(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}(M_i-m_i)\Delta_i$, $M_i - m_i = \omega_f(I_i)$, and $0 \le M_i - m_i \le 2M_{+}$ ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-oscillation]]).

[L3] Riemann's criterion: a bounded $f$ is integrable if and only if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a partition $P$ with $U(f,P)-L(f,P) < \varepsilon$ ([[thm-riemann-criterion]]).

[L4] Oscillation: $\omega_f(S) \le \omega_f(T)$ for $S \subseteq T \subseteq [a,b]$; $0 \le \omega_f(x) \le \omega_f([a,b] \cap N_\rho(x))$ for every real $\rho > 0$ and every $x \in [a,b]$; $\omega_f(x)$ is the infimum of those values over $\rho > 0$; and since $f$ is bounded every one of these values is a real number in $[0, 2M_{+}]$ ([[def-oscillation]], [[def-extended-reals]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L5] $f$ is continuous at $x \in [a,b]$ if and only if $\omega_f(x) = 0$; hence $D = \{x \in [a,b] : \omega_f(x) > 0\}$ ([[thm-continuity-iff-oscillation-zero]], [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L6] For every real $\sigma > 0$ there is a closed $G \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ with $\{x \in [a,b] : \omega_f(x) \ge \sigma\} = [a,b] \cap G$ ([[lem-oscillation-superlevel-sets-are-closed]]).

[L7] A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is compact exactly when it is closed and bounded; $[a,b]$ is closed and bounded; an intersection of closed sets is closed; every open interval is an open set ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], [[def-interval]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L8] $A$ has content zero when for every real $\tau > 0$ there are $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and reals $c_0 \le e_0, \dots, c_m \le e_m$ with $A \subseteq \bigcup_{j \le m}[c_j,e_j]$ and $\sum_{j \le m}(e_j - c_j) \le \tau$; $A$ has measure zero when the same holds with a sequence of intervals and every partial total length at most $\tau$; a subset of a null set is null ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

[L9] A set of content zero has measure zero ([[lem-content-zero-implies-null]]), and for a **compact** set the two notions coincide ([[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]]).

[L10] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $k \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(k) < \eta$; $\iota(k) > 0$ for $k \ge 1$, $\iota$ is nonnegative and nondecreasing on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L11] Assuming [A1], the union of a sequence of null subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ is null ([[thm-countable-union-of-null-is-null]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L12] Finite sums: splitting, additivity, scaling, monotonicity in the terms, and telescoping ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]). Also the interchange of two finite sums, $\sum_{i<n}\sum_{j<p}c_{i,j} = \sum_{j<p}\sum_{i<n}c_{i,j}$ for any doubly indexed family of reals; below it is applied with $p := m+1$, since $\sum_{j \le m}$ abbreviates $\sum_{j<m+1}$. That identity is **not** one of the six clauses of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] and is therefore proved here, by induction on $p$ with $n$ held fixed ([[thm-induction-principle]]). At $p = 0$ each inner sum $\sum_{j<0}c_{i,j}$ is $0$ by the recursion clause of [[def-finite-sum]], so the left side is $\sum_{i<n}0 = 0$ by clause 2 of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] taken with $\lambda = 0$, while the right side is an empty sum and so is $0$ as well. Passing from $p$ to $p+1$, the recursion clause and clause 1 of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] give $\sum_{i<n}\sum_{j<p+1}c_{i,j} = \sum_{i<n}\bigl(\sum_{j<p}c_{i,j} + c_{i,p}\bigr) = \sum_{i<n}\sum_{j<p}c_{i,j} + \sum_{i<n}c_{i,p}$, which by the induction hypothesis is $\sum_{j<p}\sum_{i<n}c_{i,j} + \sum_{i<n}c_{i,p} = \sum_{j<p+1}\sum_{i<n}c_{i,j}$, again by the recursion clause.

[L13] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]); every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ bounded above has a supremum ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L14] Ordered-field arithmetic and the absolute value: adding a constant and multiplying by a positive quantity preserve an inequality; the order is total and transitive; an open interval is order-convex ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-interval]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For a real $\sigma > 0$ put $E_\sigma := \{\, x \in [a,b] : \omega_f(x) \ge \sigma \,\}$. By [L5], $E_\sigma \subseteq D$ for every $\sigma > 0$. [L4, L5, construct]

2.1 **Each $E_\sigma$ has content zero, assuming $f$ integrable.** Let $\sigma > 0$ and $\tau > 0$ be real. By [L3] fix a partition $P = (n,t)$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \sigma\tau \cdot 2^{-1}$. Let $B := \{\, i < n : (t_i,t_{i+1}) \cap E_\sigma \ne \varnothing \,\}$ and put $\chi_i := 1$ for $i \in B$ and $\chi_i := 0$ otherwise. [step 1.1, L3, L14, choose, construct]

2.2 **The exhaustion of $D$.** Put $\sigma_k := 1/\iota(k+1)$ for $k \in \mathbb{N}$, a positive real by [L10]. Then $D = \bigcup_{k \in \mathbb{N}} E_{\sigma_k}$. For the inclusion from left to right, let $x \in D$, so $\omega_f(x) > 0$ by [L5] and $\omega_f(x)$ is a real by [L4]; if $\omega_f(x) \ge 1 = \sigma_0$ then $x \in E_{\sigma_0}$, and otherwise [L10] gives a natural $k+1 \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(k+1) < \omega_f(x)$, so $x \in E_{\sigma_k}$. For the reverse inclusion, $x \in E_{\sigma_k}$ gives $\omega_f(x) \ge \sigma_k > 0$, hence $x \in D$ by [L5]. [step 1.1, L4, L5, L10, L14]

2.3 **The converse; this half of the proof is steps 2.3, 3.2, 4.2, 5.2, 6.2, 7.2, 8.1, 9.1, 10.1, 11.1, 12.1 and 13.1, and its symbols are its own.** Assume $D$ null and let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. Put $\sigma' := \varepsilon \cdot \bigl(2(b-a)\bigr)^{-1}$ and $\tau' := \varepsilon \cdot \bigl(8M_{+}\bigr)^{-1}$, both positive by [L14]. By step 1.1 and [L8], $E_{\sigma'} \subseteq D$ is null. [step 1.1, given, L8, L14]

3.1 For $i \in B$ one has $M_i - m_i \ge \sigma$: fix $x \in (t_i,t_{i+1}) \cap E_\sigma$; since $(t_i,t_{i+1})$ is open there is a real $\rho > 0$ with $N_\rho(x) \subseteq (t_i,t_{i+1})$, so $[a,b] \cap N_\rho(x) \subseteq I_i$ and [L4] gives $\sigma \le \omega_f(x) \le \omega_f([a,b] \cap N_\rho(x)) \le \omega_f(I_i) = M_i - m_i$ by [L2]. [step 2.1, L1, L2, L4, L7, choose]

3.2 $E_{\sigma'}$ is compact: by [L6] there is a closed $G$ with $E_{\sigma'} = [a,b] \cap G$, an intersection of two closed sets, hence closed; and $E_{\sigma'} \subseteq [a,b]$ is bounded. So [L7] applies. [step 2.3, L6, L7]

4.1 Hence $\sigma\chi_i\Delta_i \le (M_i - m_i)\Delta_i$ for every $i < n$, the case $i \notin B$ because both $M_i - m_i \ge 0$ and $\Delta_i > 0$. Summing and using [L12] and [L2]: $\sigma \sum_{i<n}\chi_i\Delta_i \le U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \sigma\tau \cdot 2^{-1}$, so $\lambda := \sum_{i<n}\chi_i\Delta_i < \tau \cdot 2^{-1}$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L2, L12, L14]

4.2 By [L9] applied to the compact null set $E_{\sigma'}$, it has content zero, so by [L8] there are $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and reals $c_0 \le e_0, \dots, c_m \le e_m$ with $E_{\sigma'} \subseteq \bigcup_{j \le m}[c_j,e_j]$ and $\sum_{j\le m}(e_j-c_j) \le \tau' \cdot 2^{-1}$. Put $\mu := \tau' \cdot \bigl(4(\iota(m)+1)\bigr)^{-1} > 0$ and $O_j := (c_j - \mu,\ e_j + \mu)$, an open interval containing $[c_j,e_j]$, of length $(e_j - c_j) + 2\mu$. Then $\sum_{j\le m}\bigl((e_j-c_j)+2\mu\bigr) \le \tau' \cdot 2^{-1} + 2\mu(\iota(m)+1) = \tau' \cdot 2^{-1} + \tau' \cdot 2^{-1} = \tau'$, by [L12] and [L10]. [step 2.3, step 3.2, L8, L9, L10, L12, L14, construct]

5.1 $E_\sigma$ is covered by the finite list of $2n+1$ closed intervals $[p_j,q_j]$, $j \le 2n$, defined by $[p_j,q_j] := [t_j,t_{j+1}]$ for $j < n$ with $j \in B$, $[p_j,q_j] := [a,a]$ for $j < n$ with $j \notin B$, and $[p_j,q_j] := [t_{j-n},t_{j-n}]$ for $n \le j \le 2n$: indeed a point of $E_\sigma$ lies in $[a,b]$, hence is one of $t_0,\dots,t_n$ or lies in some $(t_i,t_{i+1})$, and in the latter case $i \in B$. Its total length is $\sum_{j \le 2n}(q_j - p_j) = \sum_{i<n}\chi_i\Delta_i + 0 = \lambda < \tau$, by splitting the sum at $n$ ([L12]). [step 2.1, step 4.1, L1, L12, L14, construct]

5.2 **The family of good intervals.** Let $\mathcal{W}$ be the set of all open intervals $(u,v)$ with $u < v$ such that either $(u,v) \subseteq O_j$ for some $j \le m$, or $\omega_f([a,b]\cap(u,v)) < \sigma'$. Every $x \in [a,b]$ lies in a member: if $x \in E_{\sigma'}$ then $x \in [c_j,e_j] \subseteq O_j$ for some $j \le m$ by step 4.2, and $O_j$ is itself a member; and if $x \notin E_{\sigma'}$ then $\omega_f(x) < \sigma'$, so by [L4] some real $\rho > 0$ has $\omega_f([a,b]\cap N_\rho(x)) < \sigma'$, and $N_\rho(x) = (x-\rho,x+\rho)$ is a member containing $x$. [step 4.2, L4, L7, L14, construct]

6.1 As $\tau > 0$ was arbitrary, $E_\sigma$ has content zero by [L8], hence measure zero by [L9]; this used only that $f$ is integrable. [step 2.1, step 5.1, L8, L9]

6.2 **Cousin's construction: a partition each of whose subintervals lies in a member of $\mathcal{W}$.** Let $S$ be the set of $y \in (a,b]$ such that some partition of $[a,y]$ has every subinterval contained in a member of $\mathcal{W}$. $S$ is nonempty: by step 5.2 fix $(\alpha,\beta) \in \mathcal{W}$ with $a \in (\alpha,\beta)$ and put $y_0 := \min\{(a+b)\cdot 2^{-1},\ (a+\beta)\cdot 2^{-1}\}$, so $a < y_0 \le b$, $y_0 < \beta$ and $\alpha < a$; the one-subinterval partition of $[a,y_0]$ has $[a,y_0] \subseteq (\alpha,\beta)$, so $y_0 \in S$. Also $S$ is bounded above by $b$, so $s := \sup S$ exists by [L13] and $a < y_0 \le s \le b$. [step 5.2, L1, L13, L14, choose]

7.1 **Integrability implies $D$ null.** Assume $f$ integrable. By step 6.1 each $E_{\sigma_k}$ is null, and $k \mapsto E_{\sigma_k}$ is a sequence of subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, so [L11] applies and $\bigcup_k E_{\sigma_k} = D$ is null by step 2.2. This is the only use of [A1] in the proof. [step 6.1, step 2.2, A1, L11]

7.2 $s = b$. By step 5.2 fix $(\alpha',\beta') \in \mathcal{W}$ with $s \in (\alpha',\beta')$. Since $\sup S = s > \alpha'$ there is $x \in S$ with $x > \alpha'$, and $x \le s$. Suppose $s < b$ and choose a real $y$ with $s < y < \min\{b, \beta'\}$, possible because $s < b$ and $s < \beta'$. Then $\alpha' < x \le s < y < \beta'$, so $[x,y] \subseteq (\alpha',\beta')$, and appending $y$ to a partition of $[a,x]$ witnessing $x \in S$ gives one for $[a,y]$ by [L1]; hence $y \in S$ with $y > \sup S$, which is impossible. [step 6.2, L1, L13, L14, choose]

8.1 $b \in S$. By step 5.2 fix $(\alpha'',\beta'') \in \mathcal{W}$ with $b \in (\alpha'',\beta'')$. Since $\sup S = b > \alpha''$ there is $x \in S$ with $x > \alpha''$ and $x \le b$. If $x = b$ there is nothing to prove; otherwise $\alpha'' < x < b < \beta''$ gives $[x,b] \subseteq (\alpha'',\beta'')$, and appending $b$ as in step 7.2 puts $b$ in $S$. So there is a partition $P' = (n',t')$ of $[a,b]$, with subintervals $I'_i$ and lengths $\Delta'_i$ for $i < n'$, every subinterval of which lies in a member of $\mathcal{W}$. [step 5.2, step 7.2, L1, L13, L14, choose]

9.1 **Good and bad subintervals.** Write $M'_i := \sup f[I'_i]$ and $m'_i := \inf f[I'_i]$. Call $i < n'$ **good** when $I'_i \subseteq W$ for some $W = (u,v) \in \mathcal{W}$ with $\omega_f([a,b]\cap(u,v)) < \sigma'$, and **bad** otherwise. For a good $i$, $I'_i \subseteq [a,b] \cap W$, so $M'_i - m'_i = \omega_f(I'_i) \le \omega_f([a,b]\cap W) < \sigma'$ by [L2] and [L4]. For a bad $i$, step 8.1 supplies a member containing $I'_i$, and it is not of the second kind, so $I'_i \subseteq O_j$ for some $j \le m$. [step 8.1, L1, L2, L4]

10.1 **Bounding the bad lengths.** For $j \le m$ put $J_j := \{\, i < n' : c_j - \mu \le t'_i \text{ and } t'_{i+1} \le e_j + \mu \,\}$ and $h^{j}_i := \Delta'_i$ for $i \in J_j$, $h^{j}_i := 0$ otherwise; a bad $i$ lies in some $J_j$ by step 9.1. Each $J_j$ consists of consecutive indices, since $i < i^{\dagger} < i^{\ddagger}$ with $i,i^{\ddagger} \in J_j$ gives $c_j - \mu \le t'_i \le t'_{i^{\dagger}}$ and $t'_{i^{\dagger}+1} \le t'_{i^{\ddagger}+1} \le e_j + \mu$. [step 9.1, L1, L14, construct]

11.1 $\sum_{i<n'}h^{j}_i \le (e_j - c_j) + 2\mu$ for each $j \le m$: the sum is $0$ when $J_j = \varnothing$; otherwise let $p := \min J_j$ and let $q$ be the least natural with $q > p$ and $q \notin J_j$, which exists by [L13] since $n' \notin J_j$, so that $J_j = \{\, i : p \le i < q \,\}$ by step 10.1. Splitting the sum at $p$ and at $q$ and discarding the vanishing outer parts, then telescoping ([L12]), gives $\sum_{i<n'}h^{j}_i = \sum_{i=p}^{q-1}\Delta'_i = t'_q - t'_p \le (e_j+\mu) - (c_j-\mu)$, using $p \in J_j$ and $q-1 \in J_j$. [step 10.1, L12, L13, L14]

12.1 Put $\beta_i := \Delta'_i$ for bad $i$ and $\beta_i := 0$ for good $i$. Then $\beta_i \le \sum_{j \le m}h^{j}_i$ pointwise by step 10.1, all terms being nonnegative, so by [L12] and step 11.1, $\sum_{i<n'}\beta_i \le \sum_{j\le m}\sum_{i<n'}h^{j}_i \le \sum_{j\le m}\bigl((e_j-c_j)+2\mu\bigr) \le \tau'$, the last step by step 4.2. [step 4.2, step 10.1, step 11.1, L12, L14]

13.1 For every $i < n'$, $(M'_i-m'_i)\Delta'_i \le \sigma'\Delta'_i + 2M_{+}\beta_i$: for good $i$ by step 9.1 and $\beta_i \ge 0$, for bad $i$ by $M'_i - m'_i \le 2M_{+}$ from [L2] and $\beta_i = \Delta'_i$. Summing over $i < n'$ and using [L12], [L1] and step 12.1: $U(f,P')-L(f,P') \le \sigma'(b-a) + 2M_{+}\tau' = \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1} + \varepsilon \cdot 4^{-1} < \varepsilon$. [step 2.3, step 9.1, step 12.1, L1, L2, L12, L14]

14.1 The real $\varepsilon > 0$ of step 2.3 was arbitrary and step 13.1 produced a partition with $U - L < \varepsilon$, so $f$ is integrable by [L3]. With step 7.1 this proves both implications, and the criterion is established; the forward half is steps 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1, 6.1 and 7.1, working with $\sigma, \tau, P, B, \chi, \lambda$, and the converse half is the steps named in step 2.3, working with $\sigma', \tau', P', \mathcal{W}, S$. [step 7.1, step 2.3, step 13.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the two halves cost.** The forward half is a single application of Riemann's criterion for each threshold $\sigma$, plus the countable union; the backward half is where all the work is, and it is entirely a covering argument: the bad set is compact and null, hence of content zero, hence coverable by finitely many open intervals of small total length, and the rest of $[a,b]$ is chopped up by Cousin's construction into pieces of oscillation below $\sigma$.

- **Why Cousin's construction and not a Lebesgue number.** Step 6.2 to step 8.1 build the partition directly from the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$: the set of right endpoints reachable by a good partition is nonempty and bounded, and its supremum is shown to be $b$ and to be attained. This uses no sequence, no subsequence and no choice, whereas the usual Lebesgue-number argument selects a bad interval for each $n$ and then extracts a convergent subsequence, which costs countable choice. Since the whole point of this item's choice ledger is that the backward implication is a ZF theorem, the choice-free route is the one taken.

- **The superlevel sets, not the discontinuity set, are what is covered.** $D$ itself is in general not closed, so [[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]] does not apply to it; each $E_\sigma$ **is** closed in $[a,b]$ ([[lem-oscillation-superlevel-sets-are-closed]]) and bounded, and that is exactly the hypothesis needed. The passage back from the $E_{\sigma_k}$ to $D$ is step 2.2, and it is where the countable union appears.

- **The exhaustion $D = \bigcup_k E_{1/\iota(k+1)}$ is derived here, and it is also claim 1 of [[thm-discontinuity-set-is-f-sigma]].** When this proof was written that theorem stated only the descriptive form — $D$ as the trace on the domain of an $F_\sigma$ subset of $\mathbb{R}$ — which is not the pointwise identity step 2.2 needs, so the identity was derived inline from [[thm-continuity-iff-oscillation-zero]] and the Archimedean property. The exhaustion has since been stated there as claim 1, precisely because several items were quoting it from a theorem that did not assert it. The inline derivation is retained because it is three lines and keeps this item's choice ledger readable in one place; citing claim 1 instead would be equally correct.

- **Both directions are sharp in the obvious sense.** The indicator of the Cantor set is discontinuous on an uncountable null set and is integrable; the indicator of the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set is discontinuous on a nowhere dense set that is not null and is not integrable ([[fs-integrability-is-equivalent-to-a-nowhere-dense-discontinuity-set]]). So neither cardinality nor category decides integrability; only measure does.

Its\nsubinterval lengths are all equal to $(b-a)/\\iota(N)$, so\n\n$$\\|U_N\\| \\;=\\; \\frac{b-a}{\\iota(N)} .$$\n\n### A partition is determined by its point set\n\n**Claim.** If $P = (n,t)$ and $P' = (n', t')$ are partitions of $[a,b]$ with\n$\\operatorname{pts}(P) = \\operatorname{pts}(P')$, then $n = n'$ and $t_i = t'_i$\nfor every $i \\le n$.\n\n*Proof.* First, $t_i = t'_i$ for every $i \\le \\min\\{n,n'\\}$, by induction on $i$\n([[thm-induction-principle]]). For $i = 0$ both equal $a$. Suppose $t_j = t'_j$\nfor all $j \\le i$ and $i + 1 \\le \\min\\{n,n'\\}$. The set\n$S := \\{\\, x \\in \\operatorname{pts}(P) : x > t_i \\,\\}$ has $t_{i+1}$ as its least\nelement: $t_{i+1} \\in S$, and any $x \\in S$ is $t_j$ for some $j \\le n$ with\n$t_j > t_i$, which forces $j > i$ because $t$ is increasing on indices $\\le n$,\nhence $j \\ge i+1$ and $x = t_j \\ge t_{i+1}$. The same argument in $P'$ makes\n$t'_{i+1}$ the least element of\n$\\{\\, x \\in \\operatorname{pts}(P') : x > t'_i \\,\\}$, which is the same set $S$,\nsince the point sets agree and $t'_i = t_i$. A set has at most one least element\n([[def-max-min]]), so $t_{i+1} = t'_{i+1}$.\n\nSecond, $n = n'$. If $n < n'$ then $t'_n = t_n = b$ by the previous paragraph,\nwhile $t'_n < t'_{n'} = b$ because $t'$ is increasing on indices $\\le n'$ and\n$n < n'$; that is impossible. Exchanging the roles of $P$ and $P'$ rules out\n$n' < n$. $\\square$\n\nSo the map $P \\mapsto \\operatorname{pts}(P)$ is injective, and a partition may be\nnamed by its point set whenever one is exhibited.\n\n### Inserting a point\n\nLet $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ and let $c \\in [a,b]$. Define a\npartition $P + c$ of $[a,b]$ as follows.\n\n- If $c \\in \\operatorname{pts}(P)$, put $P + c := P$.\n- Otherwise $c \\ne a$ and $c \\ne b$, so $a < c < b$. The set\n  $T := \\{\\, t_i : i \\le n \\text{ and } t_i < c \\,\\}$ is a nonempty finite set of\n  reals, nonempty because $t_0 = a < c$, so it has a maximum\n  ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]); let $i_0 \\le n$ be the unique index with\n  $t_{i_0} = \\max T$, unique because $t$ is injective on indices $\\le n$. Then\n  $i_0 < n$, since $t_n = b > c$ puts $t_n \\notin T$; and\n  $$t_{i_0} \\;<\\; c \\;<\\; t_{i_0+1},$$\n  the right inequality because $t_{i_0+1} \\ne c$ (as $c \\notin \\operatorname{pts}(P)$)\n  and $t_{i_0+1} < c$ would put $t_{i_0+1} \\in T$ with $t_{i_0+1} > t_{i_0} = \\max T$.\n  Put $P + c := (n+1, s)$ with\n  $$s_i := t_i \\ (i \\le i_0), \\qquad s_{i_0+1} := c, \\qquad s_i := t_{i-1} \\ (i_0 + 2 \\le i \\le n+1), \\qquad s_k := b \\ (k \\ge n+1).$$\n\nIn both cases $P + c$ is a partition of $[a,b]$ and\n\n$$\\operatorname{pts}(P + c) \\;=\\; \\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\{c\\}, \\qquad \\|P+c\\| \\;\\le\\; \\|P\\| .$$\n\nThe displayed identity is immediate from the two cases. For the mesh: in the\nfirst case nothing changes; in the second the list of subinterval lengths of\n$P + c$ is that of $P$ with $\\Delta_{i_0}$ replaced by the two numbers\n$c - t_{i_0}$ and $t_{i_0+1} - c$, each of which is smaller than\n$\\Delta_{i_0} = (c - t_{i_0}) + (t_{i_0+1} - c)$ because the other is positive.\nSo every length of $P + c$ is at most a length of $P$, and the maximum cannot\nincrease. Finally the index count grows by exactly $1$ in the second case and\nnot at all in the first.\n\n### Refinement and the common refinement\n\n$P'$ **refines** $P$, and is a **refinement** of $P$, when\n\n$$\\operatorname{pts}(P) \\;\\subseteq\\; \\operatorname{pts}(P') .$$\n\nLet $P = (n,t)$ and $Q = (m,s)$ be partitions of $[a,b]$. Applying the recursion\ntheorem ([[thm-recursion]]) to the set $\\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$,\nwhere $\\mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$ is the set of partitions of $[a,b]$, with starting\nelement $(0, P)$ and the map $(j, R) \\mapsto (j+1,\\ R + s_j)$ — legitimate\nbecause $s_j \\in [a,b]$ for every $j \\in \\mathbb{N}$ — gives a unique family\n$(R_j)_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ of partitions with $R_0 = P$ and $R_{j+1} = R_j + s_j$.\nThe **common refinement** of $P$ and $Q$ is\n\n$$P \\vee Q \\;:=\\; R_{m+1} .$$\n\n**Its point set is the union.** By induction on $j$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]),\n$\\operatorname{pts}(R_j) = \\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\{\\, s_l : l < j \\,\\}$;\ntaking $j = m+1$ gives\n\n$$\\operatorname{pts}(P \\vee Q) \\;=\\; \\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\operatorname{pts}(Q).$$\n\nHence $P \\vee Q$ refines both $P$ and $Q$; by the uniqueness claim above it is\nthe **only** partition with that point set, so $P \\vee Q = Q \\vee P$, and\n\n$$P' \\text{ refines } P \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad P \\vee P' = P' ,$$\n\nsince then $\\operatorname{pts}(P) \\cup \\operatorname{pts}(P') =\n\\operatorname{pts}(P')$.\n\n**Two size bounds, both used later.** Writing $n_R$ for the first component of a\npartition $R$:\n\n$$\\|P \\vee Q\\| \\;\\le\\; \\|P\\|, \\qquad n_{P \\vee Q} \\;\\le\\; n_P + n_Q - 1 .$$\n\nThe first is the mesh bound above applied $m+1$ times. For the second, each\ninsertion raises the index count by at most $1$, and the two insertions of\n$s_0 = a$ and $s_m = b$ raise it by $0$, since $a$ and $b$ already lie in\n$\\operatorname{pts}(P)$ and hence in $\\operatorname{pts}(R_j)$ for every $j$; so\nat most $m - 1$ of the $m+1$ insertions increase it.\n\n### The index map of a refinement\n\nLet $P' = (n',t')$ refine $P = (n,t)$. For each $i \\le n$ the point $t_i$ lies in\n$\\operatorname{pts}(P')$, so there is exactly one $\\varphi(i) \\le n'$ with\n$t'_{\\varphi(i)} = t_i$, uniqueness because $t'$ is injective on indices $\\le n'$.\nThe resulting map $\\varphi$ satisfies\n\n$$\\varphi(0) = 0, \\qquad \\varphi(n) = n', \\qquad \\varphi(i) < \\varphi(i+1) \\ \\ (i < n),$$\n\nthe first two because $t'_0 = a = t_0$ and $t'_{n'} = b = t_n$ together with\ninjectivity, and the third because $t_i < t_{i+1}$ and $t'$ is increasing on\nindices $\\le n'$. In particular $n \\le n'$. Moreover, for $i < n$ and\n$\\varphi(i) \\le j < \\varphi(i+1)$,\n\n$$I'_j \\;=\\; [\\,t'_j,\\ t'_{j+1}\\,] \\;\\subseteq\\; [\\,t_i,\\ t_{i+1}\\,] \\;=\\; I_i ,$$\n\nbecause $t_i = t'_{\\varphi(i)} \\le t'_j$ and $t'_{j+1} \\le t'_{\\varphi(i+1)} = t_{i+1}$.\n\n**The blocks are counted by telescoping.** By clause 5 of\n[[lem-finite-sum-laws]],\n$\\sum_{i<n}\\big(\\varphi(i+1) - \\varphi(i)\\big) = \\varphi(n) - \\varphi(0) = n'$,\nso, subtracting $\\sum_{i<n} 1 = n$,\n\n$$\\sum_{i<n} \\big(\\varphi(i+1) - \\varphi(i) - 1\\big) \\;=\\; n' - n ,$$\n\na sum of $n$ nonnegative integers, one for each block, which vanishes exactly at\nthe blocks consisting of a single index. This identity is the whole content of\nthe quantitative bound in [[lem-refinement-inequalities]], and it is also why\n$n \\le n'$.\n\nFinally, the lengths inside a block sum to the length of the block:\n\n$$\\sum_{j = \\varphi(i)}^{\\varphi(i+1)-1} \\Delta'_j \\;=\\; t'_{\\varphi(i+1)} - t'_{\\varphi(i)} \\;=\\; t_{i+1} - t_i \\;=\\; \\Delta_i \\qquad (i < n),$$\n\nagain by telescoping, applied to the sequence $l \\mapsto t'_{\\varphi(i)+l}$ and\nread through the index-shift convention of [[def-finite-sum]].",

Then **every** $f : A \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$: take\n   $\\delta := \\eta$, so that the only $x \\in A$ with $|x - c| < \\delta$ is $c$\n   itself, and $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \\varepsilon$.\n\n3. **On a set.** Continuity on $A$ is continuity at each point of $A$, and\n   nothing more.

The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or\nsides written with $\\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.\n\n**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,\nand **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with\nendpoints $a$ and $b$:\n\n- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \\le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly\n  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\\{a\\}$ when $a = b$.\n- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each\n  is nondegenerate.\n\nThe only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is\nthat $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because\n$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to\nboth sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside\n$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.\n\n**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \\le b$, which is\nexactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested\ninterval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always\ncarries the hypothesis $a \\le b$ in this library.\n\n**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints\n$a \\le b$ is\n\n$$\\ell = b - a \\;\\ge\\; 0 .$$\n\nLength is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the\nset: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is\n$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so\nnothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every\npoint where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.\nUnbounded intervals are assigned no length.",

The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or\nsides written with $\\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.\n\n**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,\nand **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with\nendpoints $a$ and $b$:\n\n- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \\le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly\n  when $a < b$.

## Statement

Let $F$ be a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and let
$\varepsilon \in F$ with $\varepsilon > 0$. Then there is a natural number
$n \ge 1$ such that

$$\frac{1}{n \cdot 1_F} < \varepsilon ,$$

where $n \cdot 1_F$ is the canonical natural of $F$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]]) and
$1/(n \cdot 1_F)$ is its multiplicative inverse ([[def-field]]). As is standard
we abbreviate $n \cdot 1_F$ to $n$ and write the conclusion $1/n < \varepsilon$.

This is the **reciprocal form** of the Archimedean property.
[[thm-of-archimedean]] on its own delivers only the assertion that the canonical
naturals are cofinal, $x < n \cdot 1_F$; the form actually used in analysis, that
the reciprocals of the naturals get below every positive bound, is the statement
above, and it is recorded separately so that no proof has to reconstruct the
inversion step in passing.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $F$ and an element $\varepsilon \in F$ with $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] Archimedean property: for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Inverses and order: if $a > 0$ then $a^{-1} > 0$, and if $0 < a < b$ then $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Field arithmetic: an element $a$ with $a > 0$ is nonzero by trichotomy, hence has a multiplicative inverse $a^{-1}$, and $(a^{-1})^{-1} = a$ ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Since $\varepsilon > 0$, trichotomy gives $\varepsilon \ne 0$, so $\varepsilon^{-1}$ exists, and $\varepsilon^{-1} > 0$. [given, L2, L3]

2.1 Apply [L1] to $x = \varepsilon^{-1}$: fix a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $\varepsilon^{-1} < n \cdot 1_F$. [step 1.1, L1, choose]

3.1 Chaining the two displayed inequalities gives $0 < \varepsilon^{-1} < n \cdot 1_F$; in particular $n \cdot 1_F > 0$, so $n \cdot 1_F \ne 0$ and $1/(n \cdot 1_F)$ is defined. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L3]

4.1 Apply the second claim of [L2] with $a = \varepsilon^{-1}$ and $b = n \cdot 1_F$: $0 < (n \cdot 1_F)^{-1} < (\varepsilon^{-1})^{-1}$. [step 3.1, L2]

5.1 By [L3], $(\varepsilon^{-1})^{-1} = \varepsilon$, so the natural number $n \ge 1$ fixed in step 2.1 satisfies $1/(n \cdot 1_F) < \varepsilon$, which is the assertion. [step 4.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Monotonicity gives the eventual form for free.** If $m \ge n \ge 1$ then
  $m \cdot 1_F \ge n \cdot 1_F > 0$, because $k \mapsto k \cdot 1_F$ is strictly
  increasing on the naturals $\ge 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]), and so
  $1/(m \cdot 1_F) \le 1/(n \cdot 1_F) < \varepsilon$ by [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]
  again. So the corollary yields not merely one index but a threshold: every
  $m \ge n$ satisfies $1/m < \varepsilon$. That one extra line is what a
  convergence proof needs, and it is left to the caller rather than folded into
  the statement, because the caller usually has a threshold of its own to combine
  it with.

- **Completeness is used only through [[thm-of-archimedean]].** Nothing here
  needs the least-upper-bound property directly. The corollary therefore holds
  verbatim in any Archimedean ordered field, in particular in $\mathbb{Q}$, and
  it fails in a non-Archimedean ordered field, where an infinitesimal
  $\varepsilon > 0$ is below every $1/n$ by construction.

- The equivalence is exact: the reciprocal form implies the cofinal form back
  again, since given $x > 0$ one applies it to $\varepsilon = 1/x$. The two are
  the same property written on the two sides of the inversion, and only the
  direction proved above is used in this library.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ denotes the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a subset of it.

The notions **upper bound** and **bounded above** are already fixed by
[[def-complete-ordered-field]] and are only recalled here, never redefined:
$u \in \mathbb{R}$ is an *upper bound* of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$, and
$S$ is *bounded above* if it has at least one upper bound. The dual notions are:

- $\ell \in \mathbb{R}$ is a **lower bound** of $S$ if $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.
- $S$ is **bounded below** if it has at least one lower bound.
- $S$ is **bounded** if it is both bounded above and bounded below, that is, if
  there are $\ell, u \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\ell \le s \le u$ for every $s \in S$.

## Remarks

- A bound is an element of $\mathbb{R}$ and is not required to lie in $S$. A
  bound that does lie in $S$ is a maximum or a minimum ([[def-max-min]]), and
  that is a strictly stronger condition ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Bounds come in half-lines: if $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$ then so is every
  $\ell'' \le \ell$, and if $u$ is an upper bound then so is every $u'' \ge u$.
  Consequently a set that has one bound of a given kind has infinitely many, and
  the interesting question is whether the collection of them has a best element,
  which is what a supremum ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) or an infimum
  ([[def-infimum]]) is.
- Bounded above and bounded below are independent conditions. The set
  $A = \{\, n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} : n \ge 1 \,\}$ of canonical naturals of
  $\mathbb{R}$ is bounded below by $0$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]) and is not
  bounded above ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); its reflection $-A$ is bounded above
  and not bounded below ([[lem-reflection]]).
- The empty set is bounded, and vacuously so: every real number is both an upper
  bound and a lower bound of $\emptyset$, since the defining condition quantifies
  over no elements. Having bounds is therefore much weaker than having a least
  upper bound or a greatest lower bound ([[fs-every-set-has-sup]]).

## Definition

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]) with additive identity $0_F$ and
multiplicative identity $1_F$. Define
$\iota : \mathbb{N} \to F$ by recursion on $\mathbb{N}$
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[thm-recursion]]):

$$\iota(0) \;:=\; 0_F, \qquad \iota(n+1) \;:=\; \iota(n) + 1_F .$$

$\iota(n)$ is the **canonical natural** of $n$ in $F$. It is also written
$n \cdot 1_F$, and for $n \ge 1$ it is $1_F$ added to itself $n$ times.

**Why the notation is needed at all.** A natural number in this library is a von
Neumann natural, that is a set ([[def-natural-numbers]]), and a set is not an
element of $F$. So $1/n$, $n^{\alpha}$ and $x/n$ are not expressions of $F$ when
$n$ is a natural: what they mean is $1/\iota(n)$, $\iota(n)^{\alpha}$ and
$x/\iota(n)$. The map $\iota$ is what carries a counting number into the field,
and writing it is the whole reason a reader meets $1/\iota(k+1)$ where an
informal text would write $1/(k+1)$.

## Remarks

- **Where the index shift comes from.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
  ([[def-natural-numbers]]) and $\iota(0) = 0_F$, so $1/\iota(k)$ is undefined at
  $k = 0$. A family of reciprocals indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ is therefore written
  over $\iota(k+1)$, which is why the harmonic and telescoping families of this
  library run over $k+1$ rather than over $k$. This is bookkeeping, not a
  restriction: the values are the usual ones.

- **This definition records notation; the arithmetic is proved elsewhere.** That
  $\iota$ is strictly increasing and positive on $n \ge 1$, and that it carries
  sums to sums and products to products, is [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], stated
  for an ordered field. That lemma introduces the same element by the equivalent
  recursion $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, which
  agrees with the definition above because $\iota(1) = \iota(0) + 1_F = 1_F$.
  Nothing here is new mathematics; the definition exists so that the notation has
  a home a reader can look up.

- **The symbol $\iota$ is used in this library for other canonical maps, and this
  definition does not govern them.** It also denotes the canonical field
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to F$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), the isometric
  embedding of a metric space into a completion ([[def-metric-completion]]), and
  an inclusion map $\iota : S \to X$ of a subspace. Each of those is introduced
  where it is used and means something different from the map defined here. What
  the four share is only that each is the canonical map of its situation.

- **Fields, not just ordered fields.** The recursion needs no order, so the
  definition is stated for a field; every use in this library is in an ordered
  field, and the order is what makes $\iota$ injective
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). In a field of positive characteristic $\iota$
  is not injective, which is one reason the injectivity is a lemma rather than
  part of the definition.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Then
$f$ is **discontinuous at $c$**, and $c$ is a **discontinuity of $f$**, when $f$
is not continuous at $c$ ([[def-continuity-real]]). As in
[[def-one-sided-limits]] write

$$A^{-} := A \cap (-\infty, c), \qquad A^{+} := A \cap (c, \infty)$$

([[def-interval]]), and recall that $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x)$ is defined only
when $c$ is a limit point of $A^{-}$, and $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$ only when
$c$ is a limit point of $A^{+}$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]).

**At an isolated point there is nothing to classify.** If $c$ is an isolated
point of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so that $A \cap N_{\rho}(c) = \{c\}$ for
some real $\rho > 0$, then $f$ is continuous at $c$: the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$
condition of [[def-continuity-real]] is satisfied by $\delta := \rho$, since the
only $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \rho$ is $c$ itself and $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0$. So
every discontinuity is a limit point of $A$, and the classification below covers
every case that occurs.

### Two-sided points

Suppose $c$ is a limit point of **both** $A^{-}$ and $A^{+}$, so that both
one-sided limits are well posed. Say that $c$ is a discontinuity

- **of the first kind** when both one-sided limits exist;
- **of the second kind**, also called **essential**, when at least one of the two
  one-sided limits fails to exist.

A discontinuity of the first kind is further

- **removable** when $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) = \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$; the
  common value is then different from $f(c)$, for otherwise
  [[thm-two-sided-limit-iff-both-one-sided]] would give
  $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$ and $f$ would be continuous at $c$
  ([[def-continuity-real]]);
- a **jump** when $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) \ne \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$; the
  difference $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x) - \lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x)$ is then called
  the **jump of $f$ at $c$**.

The three cases *removable*, *jump*, *essential* are mutually exclusive and
exhaust the two-sided discontinuities of $f$: either both one-sided limits
exist, and then they are equal or not, or one of them does not exist.

**Removable is a name for what can be repaired.** If $c$ is a removable
discontinuity with common one-sided value $L$, then the function agreeing with
$f$ off $c$ and taking the value $L$ at $c$ is continuous at $c$, again by
[[thm-two-sided-limit-iff-both-one-sided]] and [[def-continuity-real]]: changing
the single value $f(c)$ removes the discontinuity. No such repair is available at
a jump or at an essential discontinuity, since there the two-sided limit does not
exist at all and no choice of value at $c$ can create it.

### One-sided points

If $c$ is a limit point of exactly one of $A^{-}$ and $A^{+}$, only that side is
defined and only that side is used: $c$ is a discontinuity **of the first kind**
when the one-sided limit on the side in question exists, and **of the second
kind** otherwise. When it exists it is different from $f(c)$, since on such a
point the one-sided condition and the continuity condition are the same
condition; and there is no jump case, there being nothing to compare the value
with. The endpoints of an interval are the typical instance.

**On the two vocabularies.** *First kind* and *second kind* are Rudin's terms and
are recorded because the literature uses them; *removable*, *jump* and
*essential* are the names used in the rest of this library. They name the same
three cases and no third classification is introduced.

## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq F$.

- $u \in F$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$; $S$ is
  **bounded above** if it has an upper bound.
- $u \in F$ is a **least upper bound** (or **supremum**, $\sup S$) of $S$ if $u$
  is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le u'$ for every upper bound $u'$ of $S$.

$F$ is a **complete ordered field** (equivalently, $F$ has the
**least-upper-bound property**, or is **Dedekind complete**) if every nonempty
$S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$.

## Remarks

- A least upper bound, if it exists, is unique (two least upper bounds are each
  $\le$ the other, so equal by antisymmetry of the order).
- Applying the property to $\{-s : s \in S\}$ yields the dual **greatest lower
  bound** (infimum) property, so the two are equivalent.
- The Dedekind-cut reals have this property by construction
  ([[thm-dedekind-complete]]); the Cauchy-sequence reals acquire it via
  [[cor-cauchy-reals-lub-complete]]. This definition is the target for the
  uniqueness theorem [[thm-uniqueness-complete-ordered-field]].

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field with its order and
absolute value ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]), and
neighbourhoods are those of [[def-neighbourhood-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Then
$f$ is **continuous at $c$** when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

with $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ ranging over the **positive reals**. In the
language of neighbourhoods: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ with

$$f\bigl(A \cap N_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \;\subseteq\; N_{\varepsilon}\bigl(f(c)\bigr).$$

$f$ is **continuous on $A$** when it is continuous at every point of $A$.

**The point $c$ is required to lie in $A$, and the condition is unpunctured.**
Both differ from [[def-function-limit]], and deliberately. There the quantifier
runs over $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, which removes $x = c$; here $x = c$ is allowed,
and at $x = c$ the implication reads $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$, which is
automatic. So allowing $x = c$ costs nothing, and it is what lets the definition
be stated at every point of $A$, including the points where no limit exists.

**Three clauses, and all three are part of the definition.**

1. **At a limit point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is a limit point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]). Then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if the
   limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) \;=\; f(c)$$
   ([[def-function-limit]]). Indeed, for a given $\varepsilon > 0$ a $\delta$
   witnessing continuity witnesses the limit condition, because the limit
   condition quantifies over a subset of the points continuity quantifies over;
   and conversely a $\delta$ witnessing $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$ witnesses
   continuity, because the one point it omits, $x = c$, satisfies
   $|f(c) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ anyway.

2. **At an isolated point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is an isolated point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so that $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ for some real
   $\eta > 0$. Then **every** $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$: take
   $\delta := \eta$, so that the only $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ is $c$
   itself, and $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$.

3. **On a set.** Continuity on $A$ is continuity at each point of $A$, and
   nothing more. It is not a condition relating $f$ to points outside $A$.

Every point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$,
and never both ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so clauses 1 and 2 between them describe
continuity at every point of $A$.

**This is not the raw $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula of
[[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]].** That item records what goes
wrong when the *punctured* formula of [[def-function-limit]] is written down at
an arbitrary point of the domain: at an isolated point it is satisfied
vacuously by every real $L$ at once, so it defines nothing, and this library
therefore leaves $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ **undefined** at an isolated point.
Continuity at an isolated point is a different matter: the formula above is not
vacuous — it is a genuine condition on $f(c)$, satisfied because $f(c)$ is the
only value being compared with itself — and it names a single, well-defined
property. The limit is undefined there; the continuity is defined, and is
automatic. Clause 1 is the only place where the two notions meet, and it is
stated only where the limit exists as a notion.

**Where the distinction disappears.** If $A$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), then every $c \in A$ has some
$N_{\eta}(c) \subseteq A$, and a punctured neighbourhood is never empty
([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), so every point of $A$ is a limit point of $A$ and
clause 1 covers the whole of $A$. The same holds when $A$ is a nondegenerate
interval ([[def-interval]]). Isolated points are what force clause 2 to exist at
all, and they occur as soon as $A$ is allowed to be an arbitrary subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, as in $A = \{0\} \cup [1,2]$.

## Remarks

- **Continuity is local.** If $\eta > 0$ and $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agrees with
  $f$ on $A \cap N_{\eta}(c)$, then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if $g$
  is: any $\delta$ may be replaced by $\min\{\delta, \eta\}$, after which the
  condition only ever evaluates the two functions where they agree. So
  continuity at $c$ sees only an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of $c$, exactly
  as the limit does ([[lem-limit-is-local]]).

- **Continuity passes to subsets of the domain.** If $B \subseteq A$ and
  $c \in B$, then continuity of $f$ at $c$ gives continuity of the restriction
  $f|_B$ at $c$, with the same $\delta$: the condition on $f|_B$ quantifies over
  fewer points. The converse fails, and the standard witness is the indicator of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ restricted to $\mathbb{Q}$, which is constant and hence
  continuous, while the indicator itself is continuous nowhere
  ([[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]]).

- **The radius is a real number.** As in [[def-neighbourhood-r]], $\varepsilon$
  and $\delta$ range over the positive reals here. Restricting either quantifier
  to the positive rationals defines the same relation, by the passage recorded
  in [[def-function-limit]]: below every positive real lies a positive rational
  ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and a real $\delta$ may be shrunk to a rational
  one below it.

- **The word *continuous* is used for two things in this library, and they
  agree.** [[def-metric-continuity]] defines continuity of a map between metric
  spaces, and $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ carries the metric $d(x,y) = |x-y|$. The
  two notions coincide, and that is proved, not assumed:
  [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]] is the dictionary, and it is stated on
  this page precisely so that no later item has to guess.

## Definition

The **Axiom of Countable Choice**, written $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$, is the following
statement.

> For every family $(X_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of nonempty sets indexed by
> $\mathbb{N}$ there is a function $f$ with domain $\mathbb{N}$ such that
> $f(n) \in X_n$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

Equivalently, in the vocabulary of [[def-choice-function]]: every at most
countable family of nonempty sets ([[def-countable]]) has a choice function.

## Remarks

- **The two formulations are equivalent, and the passage between them uses no
  choice.** Given an at most countable family $\mathcal{F}$ of nonempty sets,
  either $\mathcal{F} = \varnothing$, where the empty function is a choice
  function, or a surjection $s : \mathbb{N} \to \mathcal{F}$ exists
  ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]]); applying the indexed form to
  $X_n := s(n)$ gives $f$ with $f(n) \in s(n)$, and
  $g(S) := f(\min\{\, n : s(n) = S \,\})$ is a choice function for $\mathcal{F}$,
  the minimum being canonical by [[thm-well-ordering-principle]]. Conversely a
  choice function $g$ on the at most countable family $\{\, X_n : n \in \mathbb{N} \,\}$
  gives $f(n) := g(X_n)$.

- **$\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ is strictly weaker than the Axiom of Choice**
  ([[def-axiom-of-choice]]): AC implies it immediately, since AC applies to every
  family, while it is consistent with ZF that $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ holds and AC
  fails. **It is also strictly stronger than what ZF proves**: it is consistent
  with ZF that $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ fails, as Cohen's first model shows, since an
  infinite set of reals with no countably infinite subset
  ([[rem-cohen-first-model]]) is already a failure of $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$; the
  Feferman-Levy model ([[rem-feferman-levy-model]]) is a second witness. Both
  statements are conditional on the consistency of ZF and are external results,
  established by forcing and by permutation models; they are recorded here with
  references and are **not** proved in this library, which contains neither
  technique. Of the two, only the failure of $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ is recorded in
  this library's catalogue of unproved results; the separation of
  $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ from AC in the other direction is quoted from the
  references alone.

- **Dependent choice sits between them.** The Axiom of Dependent Choice
  (DC) says that if $R$ is a relation on a nonempty set $X$ such that every
  $x \in X$ has some $y$ with $x \mathbin{R} y$, then there is a sequence
  $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ with $x_n \mathbin{R} x_{n+1}$ for all $n$. In ZF,
  $\mathrm{AC} \Rightarrow \mathrm{DC} \Rightarrow \mathrm{AC}_\omega$; both
  implications are theorems of ZF, and neither is proved here. That neither
  reverses is a pair of relative-consistency results of the same kind as in the
  previous bullet: if ZF is consistent, then so are ZF + DC + (not AC) and
  ZF + $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ + (not DC). Both are established by forcing and by
  permutation models, are quoted here from the references rather than proved, and
  cannot be stated without the consistency hypothesis; so "DC is *strictly*
  between AC and $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$" is shorthand for those two conditional
  statements and is never used here as a standalone assertion. DC is the
  principle that legitimises "choose $x_0$, then choose $x_1$ depending on
  $x_0$, and so on"; $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ only legitimises countably many
  *independent* choices made at once.

- **Being an axiom, $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ carries no well-definedness obligation**,
  which is why this item has no `justified_by`. Its role in this library is
  bookkeeping: [[thm-countable-union-of-countable]] assumes it and flags the exact
  step that spends it, and [[fs-countable-union-theorem-of-zf]] records that the
  assumption cannot be removed.

- Every result *proved* on this page other than
  [[thm-countable-union-of-countable]] is a theorem of ZF alone. In particular
  [[lem-subset-of-countable]], [[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]],
  [[thm-schroder-bernstein]], [[thm-rationals-countable]], [[thm-cantor-powerset]]
  and [[thm-r-uncountable]] are choice free, and each says so. The false
  statements at the end of the page are not all of that kind, and the claim above
  does not cover them: two of the three refute a ZF-provability claim only under
  the hypothesis that ZF is consistent, quoting an external independence result
  rather than proving it, and they say so in their own Facts.

## Definition

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]). Write $\mathcal{P}$ for the set of all partitions of
$[a,b]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]) and put

$$\mathcal{L} \;:=\; \{\, L(f,P) \ : \ P \in \mathcal{P} \,\}, \qquad \mathcal{U} \;:=\; \{\, U(f,P) \ : \ P \in \mathcal{P} \,\}$$

for the sets of lower and of upper Darboux sums ([[def-darboux-sums]]).

### Both extrema exist

**$\mathcal{P}$ is nonempty**: the pair $(1, t)$ with $t_0 := a$ and $t_k := b$
for $k \ge 1$ is a partition of $[a,b]$, since $a < b$. So $\mathcal{L}$ and
$\mathcal{U}$ are nonempty.

**$\mathcal{L}$ is bounded above and $\mathcal{U}$ is bounded below.** Fix any
$Q \in \mathcal{P}$. By claim 2 of [[lem-refinement-inequalities]],
$L(f,P) \le U(f,Q)$ for every $P \in \mathcal{P}$, so $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound
of $\mathcal{L}$; and $L(f,Q) \le U(f,P)$ for every $P$, so $L(f,Q)$ is a lower
bound of $\mathcal{U}$.

Hence a nonempty set bounded above has a supremum
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and a nonempty set bounded below has an infimum
([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]), each unique ([[lem-sup-unique]]).
The **lower** and **upper Darboux integrals** of $f$ over $[a,b]$ are the real
numbers

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;:=\; \sup \mathcal{L} \;=\; \sup_{P} L(f,P), \qquad \overline{\int_a^b} f \;:=\; \inf \mathcal{U} \;=\; \inf_{P} U(f,P) .$$

### The lower integral never exceeds the upper one

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f .$$

Indeed, for each fixed $Q \in \mathcal{P}$ the number $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound
of $\mathcal{L}$, so the least upper bound satisfies
$\underline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,Q)$. As $Q$ was arbitrary, $\underline{\int_a^b}f$
is a lower bound of $\mathcal{U}$, and the greatest lower bound satisfies
$\underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f$ ([[def-infimum]]).

Moreover, for **every** partition $P$,

$$L(f,P) \;\le\; \underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; U(f,P) ,$$

the outer inequalities because a member of a set is at most its supremum and at
least its infimum.

### Integrability

$f$ is **Darboux integrable on $[a,b]$**, and on this page simply
**integrable**, when

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;=\; \overline{\int_a^b} f ,$$

and then the common value is written

$$\int_a^b f \qquad \text{or} \qquad \int_a^b f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x ,$$

the **integral of $f$ over $[a,b]$**. It is a single well-determined real
number, being the common value of two numbers each of which is unique
([[lem-sup-unique]]). Without the displayed equality the symbol $\int_a^b f$ is
not defined and is never written.

**The inequality above is the whole difficulty.** By the previous paragraph
integrability is *never* a question of one integral exceeding the other, only of
the gap $\overline{\int_a^b} f - \underline{\int_a^b} f \ge 0$ being $0$; and by
[[thm-riemann-criterion]] that gap is $0$ exactly when a single partition can be
found making $U(f,P) - L(f,P)$ small. Whether that is possible is settled
completely, in terms of the discontinuities of $f$, by
[[thm-lebesgue-criterion]].

**"Riemann integrable" means the same thing here.** The definition above is
Darboux's. Riemann's own definition, in terms of tagged partitions of small
mesh, is [[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]], and the two define the same
class of functions with the same integral by [[thm-darboux-equals-riemann]].
Until that theorem is proved the two phrases are kept apart; after it they are
used interchangeably, as they are throughout the literature.

## Remarks

- **The supremum is over all partitions, and nothing is selected.** Both
  $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{U}$ are sets determined by $f$ and $[a,b]$ alone,
  and $\sup$ and $\inf$ are canonical, so no choice principle is involved in
  forming either integral. Where a choice does enter on this page is recorded in
  [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].

- **Why the lower integral is a supremum and not an infimum.** Refining a
  partition can only increase a lower sum and decrease an upper sum
  ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]]), so the lower sums push up towards the
  integral and the upper sums push down towards it. Taking $\inf \mathcal{L}$
  would return the sum over the coarsest partition and would carry no
  information about $f$ beyond its infimum on $[a,b]$.

- **A bounded $f$ always has both integrals; only their equality can fail.** The
  Dirichlet function on $[0,1]$ has lower integral $0$ and upper integral $1$
  ([[fs-bounded-implies-riemann-integrable]]), which is the standard witness that
  the definition above is not vacuous in either direction.

## Definition

Let $a < b$ be reals, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be **bounded**
([[def-bounded-set]]), so that there is a real $M \ge 0$ with $|f(x)| \le M$ for
every $x \in [a,b]$, and let $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ with
subintervals $I_i = [t_i, t_{i+1}]$ and lengths $\Delta_i = t_{i+1} - t_i$ for
$i < n$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

### The two extreme values on a subinterval

For $i < n$ put

$$m_i \;:=\; \inf f[I_i], \qquad M_i \;:=\; \sup f[I_i], \qquad f[I_i] \;=\; \{\, f(x) : x \in I_i \,\} .$$

**Both exist.** The set $f[I_i]$ is nonempty, because $t_i < t_{i+1}$ makes $I_i$
nonempty ([[def-interval]]), and it is bounded, because $|f(x)| \le M$ for every
$x$ ([[def-bounded-set]]). A nonempty set bounded above has a supremum
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and a nonempty set bounded below has an infimum
([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]); each is unique, so the notations
$\inf f[I_i]$ and $\sup f[I_i]$ name single real numbers ([[lem-sup-unique]]).

**They bracket the values, and each other.** For $x \in I_i$,

$$-M \;\le\; m_i \;\le\; f(x) \;\le\; M_i \;\le\; M ,$$

the outer inequalities because $-M$ is a lower bound and $M$ an upper bound of
$f[I_i]$, and the middle ones by the definitions of infimum and supremum. In
particular $m_i \le M_i$ and $M_i - m_i \le 2M$.

The dependence of $m_i$ and $M_i$ on $f$ and on $P$ is suppressed in the
notation, as is customary; where two partitions are in play the sums below carry
the partition and the extreme values are written out.

### The two Darboux sums

$$L(f,P) \;:=\; \sum_{i<n} m_i \,\Delta_i, \qquad U(f,P) \;:=\; \sum_{i<n} M_i \,\Delta_i ,$$

the finite sums of [[def-finite-sum]], indexed by $i \in \mathbb{N}$ with
$i < n$. Both are real numbers, being finite sums of reals, and

$$L(f,P) \;\le\; U(f,P) ,$$

by monotonicity of finite sums, clause 4 of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], since
$m_i \Delta_i \le M_i \Delta_i$ for every $i < n$: multiplying $m_i \le M_i$ by
$\Delta_i > 0$ preserves the inequality ([[def-ordered-field]]).

### The gap on a subinterval is the oscillation there

For every $i < n$,

$$M_i - m_i \;=\; \omega_f(I_i) \;=\; \sup\{\, |f(x) - f(y)| \ : \ x, y \in I_i \,\} ,$$

the oscillation of $f$ on the set $I_i$ ([[def-oscillation]]). The supremum is a
real number here rather than an extended one, because $f$ is bounded
([[def-oscillation]], [[def-extended-reals]]). The identity is proved in two
inequalities.

*The oscillation is at most the gap.* For $x, y \in I_i$ both $f(x)$ and $f(y)$
lie in $[m_i, M_i]$, so $f(x) - f(y) \le M_i - m_i$ and
$f(y) - f(x) \le M_i - m_i$, whence $|f(x) - f(y)| \le M_i - m_i$
([[lem-of-abs-value]]). So $M_i - m_i$ is an upper bound of the set whose
supremum is $\omega_f(I_i)$.

*The gap is at most the oscillation.* Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real. By the
$\varepsilon$-characterisations of the supremum and the infimum
([[lem-sup-epsilon]], [[lem-inf-epsilon]]) there are $x, y \in I_i$ with
$f(x) > M_i - \varepsilon/2$ and $f(y) < m_i + \varepsilon/2$; then

$$|f(x) - f(y)| \;\ge\; f(x) - f(y) \;>\; (M_i - m_i) - \varepsilon ,$$

so $\omega_f(I_i) > (M_i - m_i) - \varepsilon$. As $\varepsilon > 0$ was
arbitrary, $\omega_f(I_i) \ge M_i - m_i$: otherwise
$\varepsilon := (M_i - m_i) - \omega_f(I_i)$ would be positive and give
$\omega_f(I_i) > \omega_f(I_i)$.

This identity is what connects the Darboux machinery to the pointwise
oscillation of [[def-oscillation]], and it is the hinge of
[[thm-lebesgue-criterion]].

## Remarks

- **Boundedness is a hypothesis of the definition, not of the theorems.** Without
  it $f[I_i]$ may fail to have a supremum in $\mathbb{R}$ and $U(f,P)$ is not
  defined at all. Every statement on this page that mentions $L$ or $U$ therefore
  carries "bounded $f$" in its hypotheses, and none of them is a restriction that
  could be lifted: an unbounded function has no Darboux sums to compare.

- **Why the infimum and the supremum, and not a value of $f$.** Replacing $m_i$
  by $f(\xi_i)$ for a point $\xi_i \in I_i$ gives the Riemann sums of
  [[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]], which depend on a choice of points
  and are not extremal. The Darboux sums are canonical functions of $f$ and $P$
  alone, which is what makes the supremum and infimum over all partitions in
  [[def-darboux-integral]] well posed without any selection.

- **The empty sum does not occur.** A partition has $n \ge 1$
  ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]), so $L(f,P)$ and $U(f,P)$ are sums of at
  least one term. The first term is $m_0 \Delta_0$, over the subinterval
  $[a, t_1]$; the indexing starts at $i = 0$ throughout this page.

## Definition

Fix two objects $-\infty$ and $+\infty$, distinct from one another and neither of
them a real number ([[def-real-numbers]]), and set

$$\overline{\mathbb{R}} := \mathbb{R} \cup \{-\infty, +\infty\}.$$

This is a **new object**, introduced here explicitly with its own order and its
own partial arithmetic. It is not an enlargement of the field $\mathbb{R}$, and
no operation of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) is redefined by
anything below.

**The order.** For $a, b \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ declare

$$a \le b \quad :\Longleftrightarrow \quad a = -\infty \ \text{ or } \ b = +\infty \ \text{ or } \ \big(a, b \in \mathbb{R} \text{ and } a \le b \text{ in } \mathbb{R}\big),$$

with $\mathbb{R}$ ordered as in [[def-real-order]], and write $a < b$ for
"$a \le b$ and $a \ne b$" as usual ([[def-partial-order]]).

**$(\overline{\mathbb{R}}, \le)$ is a totally ordered set, and the inclusion of
$\mathbb{R}$ preserves and reflects the order.** All four checks are immediate
from the displayed clauses.

- *Reflexive.* For $a = \pm\infty$ one of the first two clauses applies; for
  $a \in \mathbb{R}$ the third does, since $a \le a$ in $\mathbb{R}$.
- *Antisymmetric.* Suppose $a \le b$ and $b \le a$. If $a = -\infty$ then
  $b \le a$ forces $b = -\infty$, since the clause $a = +\infty$ fails and $b, a$
  are not both real. Symmetrically $b = -\infty$ forces $a = -\infty$, and
  $a = +\infty$ or $b = +\infty$ forces the other to be $+\infty$. In the one
  remaining situation $a$ and $b$ are both real and antisymmetry is that of
  $\mathbb{R}$.
- *Transitive.* Let $a \le b \le c$. If $a = -\infty$ or $c = +\infty$ the
  conclusion is one of the first two clauses. Otherwise $a \ne -\infty$ forces,
  in $a \le b$, either $b = +\infty$ or $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$; and $c \ne +\infty$
  forces, in $b \le c$, either $b = -\infty$ or $b, c \in \mathbb{R}$. The value
  $b = +\infty$ is incompatible with the second alternative pair, so $b$ is real,
  hence so are $a$ and $c$, and transitivity is that of $\mathbb{R}$.
- *Total.* If $a = -\infty$ or $b = +\infty$ then $a \le b$; if $b = -\infty$ or
  $a = +\infty$ then $b \le a$; otherwise both are real and the order of
  $\mathbb{R}$ is total.
- *Preserved and reflected.* For $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ the first two clauses fail,
  so $a \le b$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ says exactly $a \le b$ in $\mathbb{R}$.

In particular $-\infty$ is the least and $+\infty$ the greatest element of
$\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, and $-\infty < x < +\infty$ for every $x \in \mathbb{R}$.

**Reflection.** Extend negation by

$$-(+\infty) := -\infty, \qquad -(-\infty) := +\infty,$$

keeping the field negative on $\mathbb{R}$. The resulting map
$\nu : \overline{\mathbb{R}} \to \overline{\mathbb{R}}$, $\nu(a) = -a$, satisfies
$\nu(\nu(a)) = a$ and

$$a \le b \iff -b \le -a \qquad (a, b \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}).$$

For $a$ and $b$ real this is the elementwise order reversal in $\mathbb{R}$:
translation invariance ([[lem-of-add-order]]) applied with the constant $-a-b$
turns $a < b$ into $-b < -a$ and, applied with the constant $a+b$, turns it back,
while $a = b$ holds exactly when $-a = -b$. In every other case both sides are
decided by the first two clauses of the order: $a = -\infty$ makes both sides
true, as does $b = +\infty$, and if $a \ne -\infty$, $b \ne +\infty$ and $a, b$
are not both real then one of $a = +\infty$, $b = -\infty$ holds and both sides
are false.

**Partial addition.** For $a, b \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ the sum $a + b$ is
defined by

- $a + b$ = the field sum, when $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$;
- $a + b := +\infty$ when $a = +\infty$ and $b \ne -\infty$, or $b = +\infty$ and $a \ne -\infty$;
- $a + b := -\infty$ when $a = -\infty$ and $b \ne +\infty$, or $b = -\infty$ and $a \ne +\infty$;

and **the two sums $(+\infty) + (-\infty)$ and $(-\infty) + (+\infty)$ are left
undefined**. Addition is commutative where defined, and

$$-(a + b) = (-a) + (-b),$$

each side being defined exactly when the other is: the excluded pairs
$\{+\infty, -\infty\}$ are exchanged by $\nu$, and the three clauses above are
exchanged accordingly.

**Partial multiplication.** For $a, b \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ the product $ab$
is defined by

- $ab$ = the field product, when $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$;
- $ab := +\infty$ when one of $a, b$ is $\pm\infty$, the other is $\ne 0$, and both are $> 0$ or both are $< 0$;
- $ab := -\infty$ when one of $a, b$ is $\pm\infty$, the other is $\ne 0$, and one is $> 0$ and the other $< 0$;

and **every product with one factor $0$ and the other $\pm\infty$ is left
undefined**. The comparisons $> 0$ and $< 0$ here are taken in the order above,
under which $+\infty > 0 > -\infty$.

**Nothing else is defined.** There is no subtraction, no division, no
exponentiation and no absolute value on $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ in this library;
where such an expression is wanted it is written out in the two defined
operations, and where a case falls in the undefined list the statement carries an
explicit hypothesis saying so.

## Remarks

- **$\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is not a field, and not an ordered field.** It has no
  additive inverse for $+\infty$: $(+\infty) + b$ is $+\infty$ whenever it is
  defined and is never $0$. So none of the field axioms
  ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) is available here, and no algebraic
  manipulation valid in $\mathbb{R}$ may be transported to
  $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ without a separate justification.

- **Why the excluded cases are excluded.** The three defined clauses of each
  operation are exactly the cases in which the value is forced by the limiting
  behaviour of the sequences involved, and the excluded cases are exactly the
  ones in which it is not. For the product this is proved on the companion page:
  [[cex-zero-times-infinity-indeterminate]] exhibits a null sequence and two
  sequences diverging to $+\infty$ whose products behave differently, so no value
  assigned to $0 \cdot (+\infty)$ could be compatible with products of limits.
  The same phenomenon rules out a value for $(+\infty) + (-\infty)$: with
  $a_k = k$ and $b_k = -k$ the sum is constantly $0$, while with $b_k = -2k$ it
  diverges to $-\infty$. Leaving them undefined is not squeamishness, it is the
  only option that keeps every later statement about limits true without a
  side condition hidden inside the arithmetic.

- **This is the separate introduction that [[rem-sup-conventions]] points to.**
  That remark refuses the conventions $\sup S = +\infty$ and
  $\inf \emptyset = +\infty$ inside $\mathbb{R}$, and records that the extended
  real line is introduced explicitly here, with its own order and its own partial
  arithmetic kept separate from $\mathbb{R}$ rather than quietly extending it.
  This is that introduction. The suprema and infima of [[def-complete-ordered-field]],
  [[def-infimum]] and the whole suprema page remain real numbers with their
  nonempty and bounded hypotheses intact; what is new is a *separate* supremum
  operation, taken in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ and named as such, supplied by
  [[lem-extended-reals-complete]].

- **The symbols were already in circulation, and this definition does not change
  what they meant.** [[def-divergence-to-infinity]] defines the single phrase
  "$x_k \to +\infty$" as an abbreviation for a condition on $(x_k)$, and says in
  as many words that it does not define an object named $+\infty$. That reading
  is still correct: nothing in [[def-divergence-to-infinity]] is restated or
  reinterpreted here, and [[def-extended-limits]] is where the two are related, by
  a definition that quotes the old one rather than replacing it. Likewise the
  interval notation $(a, \infty)$ of [[def-interval]] is notation for a condition
  on one side, not an endpoint, and stays that way.

- **Why the order is defined by three clauses rather than by a picture.** The
  clauses are what the verifications above actually use, and they make the two
  facts that later proofs lean on immediate: every element is $\le +\infty$ and
  every element is $\ge -\infty$, with no case analysis at the point of use.

## Definition

Throughout this page $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), in particular an ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]]) and a field ([[def-field]]), and $\mathbb{N}$ is the set
of natural numbers ([[def-natural-numbers]]) with successor $\sigma(n) = n + 1$
([[def-nat-addition]]).

Let $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a sequence of reals, written $a_k$ for
$a(k)$. **Finite sums and finite products of $a$ are defined by recursion on the
upper index**, which is legitimate because of the recursion theorem
([[thm-recursion]]). That theorem produces a function of one variable, so the
running index has to be carried along inside the value: applying it to the set
$A = \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$, the starting element $(0, 0)$ and the function
$f(n, s) = (\sigma(n),\, s + a_n)$ gives a unique
$g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$ with

$$g(0) = (0, 0), \qquad g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n)) \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Write $g(n) = \big(\pi_1(g(n)),\, \Sigma_n\big)$ for its two coordinates.

**The first coordinate is the index itself, and that is a small induction, not an
observation** ([[thm-induction-principle]]). Indeed $\pi_1(g(0)) = 0$; and if
$\pi_1(g(n)) = n$, then
$g(\sigma(n)) = f\big(\pi_1(g(n)), \Sigma_n\big) = \big(\sigma(\pi_1(g(n))),\, \Sigma_n + a_{\pi_1(g(n))}\big) = \big(\sigma(n),\, \Sigma_n + a_n\big)$,
so $\pi_1(g(\sigma(n))) = \sigma(n)$. By induction $\pi_1(g(n)) = n$ for every
$n \in \mathbb{N}$. Only now may the second coordinate of the two displayed
clauses be read off, and doing so gives

$$\Sigma_0 = 0, \qquad \Sigma_{\sigma(n)} = \Sigma_n + a_n .$$

$\Sigma$ is moreover the **unique** function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with those
two properties: if $\Sigma'$ also has them then $n \mapsto (n, \Sigma'_n)$ satisfies
the two clauses defining $g$, hence equals $g$ by the uniqueness clause of
[[thm-recursion]], so $\Sigma' = \Sigma$.

We write $\sum_{k < n} a_k := \Sigma_n$. The same construction with starting
element $(0, 1)$ and $f(n, p) = (\sigma(n),\, p \cdot a_n)$, with the same
induction on the first coordinate and the same uniqueness argument, gives the
unique $\Pi : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with

$$\Pi_0 = 1, \qquad \Pi_{\sigma(n)} = \Pi_n \cdot a_n ,$$

and we write $\prod_{k < n} a_k := \Pi_n$.

**Notation.** For $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ we abbreviate

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \sum_{k < n+1} a_k, \qquad \prod_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \prod_{k < n+1} a_k,$$

and, for a general lower index $m$ with $m \le n + 1$, writing $d = n + 1 - m$
for the number of terms,

$$\sum_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \sum_{j < d} a_{m+j}, \qquad \prod_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \prod_{j < d} a_{m+j} .$$

When $m = n + 1$ we have $d = 0$ and the sum is **empty**, with value $0$, while
the empty product has value $1$. In the same spirit $\sum_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ is
notation for the empty sum $\Sigma_0 = 0$ and $\prod_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ for the
empty product $\Pi_0 = 1$; the index $-1$ never occurs as an element of
$\mathbb{N}$ and is only a way of writing "no terms".

Only finitely many values of $a$ enter $\sum_{k<n} a_k$, so the notation
$\sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\prod_{k<n} a_k$ is also used for a list
$a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$ of reals given without reference to any extension of the
list to all of $\mathbb{N}$: extend the list by $a_k = 0$ (respectively
$a_k = 1$) for $k \ge n$ and apply the definition above.

## Remarks

- **Why recursion and not "$a_0 + a_1 + \cdots + a_{n-1}$".** The dots are not a
  definition: they presuppose that the displayed pattern determines a value for
  every $n$, which is exactly what the recursion theorem
  ([[thm-recursion]]) supplies, and its uniqueness clause is what makes
  $\sum_{k<n} a_k$ a single well-determined real rather than a family of choices.
  Associativity and commutativity of addition are *not* used in the definition;
  they are used in the laws proved from it ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).
- **Naturals and rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$ (a convention used on the whole
  page).** A natural number $n$ and a rational number $r$ are not literally
  elements of $\mathbb{R}$: they enter $\mathbb{R}$ through the canonical
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$, which is an injective,
  order-preserving field homomorphism ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), restricting on
  positive naturals to $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} = 1_\mathbb{R} + \cdots + 1_\mathbb{R}$
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). Following ordinary practice, and only where no
  confusion is possible, we write $n$ for $\iota(n)$ and $r$ for $\iota(r)$; so,
  for instance, $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k<n} a_k$ means
  $\iota(n)^{-1} \cdot \sum_{k<n} a_k$, which makes sense because
  $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$. Exponents are the one place where the
  identification is deliberately NOT made: in $a^n$ and $a^r$ the exponent stays
  a natural, an integer or a rational ([[def-integer-power]],
  [[def-rational-power]]), never a real.
- The two indexings are related by $\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k = \sum_{k < n+1} a_k$, so
  a statement proved for one is available for the other. Sums over $k < n$ are
  the primitive form here because $\Sigma_0$, the empty sum, is then the base
  case of every induction, and no index outside $\mathbb{N}$ is ever needed.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), intervals and their lengths are as in
[[def-interval]], and a *sequence* is a function on $\mathbb{N}$, which contains
$0$. Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

- $A$ has **measure zero**, equivalently $A$ is **null**, when for every real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ there are sequences $(a_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ and
  $(b_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of reals with $a_k \le b_k$ for every $k$, such
  that
  $$A \subseteq \bigcup_{k \in \mathbb{N}} [a_k, b_k] \qquad \text{and} \qquad \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (b_k - a_k) \text{ converges with sum } \le \varepsilon .$$
- $A$ has **content zero** when for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there are
  $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and reals $a_0 \le b_0, \dots, a_n \le b_n$ with
  $$A \subseteq \bigcup_{j \le n} [a_j, b_j] \qquad \text{and} \qquad \sum_{j=0}^{n} (b_j - a_j) \le \varepsilon .$$

The number $b_k - a_k \ge 0$ is the length of $[a_k,b_k]$ ([[def-interval]]), and
the sums are the series and the finite sums of [[def-series]] and
[[def-finite-sum]].

**Working form: only the partial sums have to be checked.** All the terms
$b_k - a_k$ are $\ge 0$, so by claim 2 of
[[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]] the series converges exactly when
its partial sums are bounded above, and its sum is then their supremum.
Consequently, for a fixed $\varepsilon > 0$,

$$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(b_k - a_k) \text{ converges with sum} \le \varepsilon \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \sum_{k<n} (b_k - a_k) \le \varepsilon \ \text{ for every } n \in \mathbb{N},$$

since a supremum is $\le \varepsilon$ exactly when $\varepsilon$ is an upper
bound of the set it is the supremum of ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]). Every
verification of nullity below checks the right-hand condition.

**Closed intervals lose nothing.** A bounded interval with endpoints
$a \le b$ is contained in $[a,b]$ and has the same length ([[def-interval]]), so
a cover by intervals of any of the four bounded forms yields a cover by closed
intervals with the same lengths. The definition is therefore stated with closed
intervals once and for all. Covers by *open* intervals are a genuinely different
demand, and passing to one costs a little extra length: the enlargement
$[a_k,b_k] \subseteq (a_k - \delta_k,\ b_k + \delta_k)$ is carried out where it is
needed, in [[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]] and in
[[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]].

**Both notions are inherited by subsets.** If $B \subseteq A$ and $A$ is null,
then any cover of $A$ covers $B$, so $B$ is null; the same sentence with finite
covers shows a subset of a set of content zero has content zero.

**A finite cover is a countable cover, so content zero implies measure zero.**
Padding the list $[a_0,b_0], \dots, [a_n,b_n]$ with the degenerate intervals
$[0,0]$ for $k > n$ leaves the total length unchanged, by the splitting law for
finite sums ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]). This is recorded as a lemma with its
proof, [[lem-content-zero-implies-null]], because it is cited on its own.

## Remarks

- **The two notions genuinely differ.** $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$ is null and does
  not have content zero ([[cex-null-set-not-of-content-zero]]), so the two
  quantifier patterns, "a sequence of intervals" and "a finite list of
  intervals", are not interchangeable. They do agree for compact sets
  ([[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]]), and the compact case is the only one in
  which content zero is used anywhere on this pair of pages. Nothing is claimed
  about what later pages will do with it.

- **Why "content" and not "measure" for the finite version.** The finite-cover
  notion is the vanishing of the Jordan outer content, and the countable-cover
  notion is the vanishing of the Lebesgue outer measure. Neither outer quantity
  is defined in this library, and no item here assigns a nonzero size to any set:
  every statement is of the shape "can, or cannot, be covered by intervals of
  total length below such and such a bound". That is a deliberate restriction of
  scope at this point in the reading order, not a claim that the general notions
  are unavailable in mathematics.

- **Measure zero is not vacuous and not universal.** No interval with two
  distinct endpoints is null ([[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]]), while
  every at most countable set is ([[lem-countable-sets-are-null]]) and so is the
  uncountable Cantor set ([[thm-cantor-set-properties]]). The three facts
  together are what make the notion worth having.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]) and its absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]).

Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ with
$\varepsilon > 0$. The **$\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\},$$

and the **punctured $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \;=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}.$$

The two descriptions of $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ agree because $|y - x| = 0$ holds
exactly when $y = x$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**A neighbourhood is an open interval.** For every $x$ and every
$\varepsilon > 0$,

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;=\; (x - \varepsilon,\ x + \varepsilon),$$

the interval of [[def-interval]]. Indeed [[lem-of-abs-value]] gives, for
$\varepsilon > 0$, the equivalence $|y - x| < \varepsilon \iff -\varepsilon <
y - x < \varepsilon$, and adding $x$ throughout turns the right-hand side into
$x - \varepsilon < y < x + \varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**The centre lies in its own neighbourhoods.** $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, since
$|x - x| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**Punctured neighbourhoods are never empty.** The element
$y := x + \varepsilon/2$ satisfies $|y - x| = \varepsilon/2$, which is
$> 0$ and $< \varepsilon$, so $y \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$
([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

**Monotonicity in the radius.** If $0 < \delta \le \varepsilon$ then
$N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, because $|y - x| < \delta \le
\varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**Nesting at an interior point.** If $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and
$0 < \delta \le \varepsilon - |y - x|$, then

$$N_\delta(y) \;\subseteq\; N_\varepsilon(x).$$

Indeed for $z \in N_\delta(y)$ the triangle inequality
([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]) gives
$|z - x| = |(z - y) + (y - x)| \le |z - y| + |y - x| < \delta + |y - x| \le
\varepsilon$. Note that $\varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ precisely because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, so such a $\delta$ always exists.

## Remarks

- **The radius is a real number, not a rational.** Nothing on this page tests a
  condition against rational radii only. That convention belongs to
  [[def-real-limit]], where the quantifier is over rational $\varepsilon$ and
  the passage between the rational and the real form is the sanctioned remark of
  [[def-sequence]]. Here $\varepsilon$ ranges over the positive reals
  throughout, and every statement above is proved for an arbitrary positive
  real.

- **Why the punctured version is separated out.** A limit point of a set is a
  point every punctured neighbourhood of which meets the set
  ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and deleting the centre is exactly what stops a point
  of the set from qualifying automatically. The unpunctured condition defines
  the weaker notion of an adherent point, and the difference between the two is
  precisely an isolated point.

- **Nesting is the workhorse.** Almost every openness verification on this page
  has the shape "given $y$ in the set, shrink the radius by the distance
  already travelled", which is the nesting property above. It is recorded here
  once so that no later proof has to redo the triangle inequality in passing.

## Definition

Let $U, F \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]].

- $U$ is **open** when for every $x \in U$ there is a real $\varepsilon > 0$
  with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$.
- $F$ is **closed** when its complement $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open.
- A set is **clopen** when it is both open and closed.

The whole of the topology of $\mathbb{R}$ developed on this page rests on this
one definition: closedness is *defined* as openness of the complement, and every
other description of a closed set on this page is a theorem
([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]]).

**$\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen.** The condition defining openness
quantifies over the elements of the set, so it holds vacuously for
$\varnothing$; and for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ one has $N_1(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$,
so $\mathbb{R}$ is open. Since each of the two is the complement of the other,
each is also closed.

**Every neighbourhood is open.** Let $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and put
$\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x|$, which is $> 0$ because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$. The nesting property of [[def-neighbourhood-r]] gives
$N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$. So every point of $N_\varepsilon(x)$
has a neighbourhood inside it.

**The four open forms of [[def-interval]] are open sets.** Let $a, b \in
\mathbb{R}$.

- $(a,b)$: for $x$ with $a < x < b$, both $x - a > 0$ and $b - x > 0$, so
  $\delta := \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ is a positive real (the minimum of a
  two-element set of reals exists, [[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).
  If $|y - x| < \delta$ then $y > x - \delta \ge x - (x - a) = a$ and
  $y < x + \delta \le x + (b - x) = b$, so $y \in (a,b)$; hence
  $N_\delta(x) \subseteq (a,b)$.
- $(a,\infty)$: for $x > a$ take $\delta := x - a > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y > x - \delta = a$.
- $(-\infty,b)$: for $x < b$ take $\delta := b - x > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y < x + \delta = b$.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: already treated above.

**The four closed forms of [[def-interval]] are closed sets.** In each case the
complement is shown open directly.

- $[a,b]$: if $x \notin [a,b]$ then $x < a$ or $x > b$ by trichotomy
  ([[def-ordered-field]]). If $x < a$, take $\delta := a - x > 0$; every
  $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has $y < x + \delta = a$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. If
  $x > b$, take $\delta := x - b > 0$; every $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has
  $y > x - \delta = b$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. So
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus [a,b]$ is open.
- $[a,\infty)$: its complement is $(-\infty,a)$, which is open by the previous
  paragraph.
- $(-\infty,b]$: its complement is $(b,\infty)$, which is open.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: its complement is $\varnothing$, which is
  open.

## Remarks

- **Open and closed are not opposites, and not exhaustive.** A set may be
  neither: the half-open interval $[0,1)$ is neither open nor closed
  ([[fs-every-set-is-open-or-closed]]). A set may be both: $\varnothing$ and
  $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen. The words are inherited from the interval terminology
  of [[def-interval]], and the agreement between the two usages is exactly the
  two lists verified above: an interval called open there is an open set here,
  and an interval called closed there is a closed set here.

- **A clopen set is a disconnection waiting to happen.** If $A$ is clopen and
  both $A$ and $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ are nonempty, then each of the two is
  its own closure, so the two are separated in the sense of
  [[def-connected-r]] and $\mathbb{R} = A \cup (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)$ is a
  disconnection. Since $\mathbb{R}$ is order-convex it is connected
  ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]]), so no such $A$ exists:
  $\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are the only clopen subsets of $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The half-open forms are the ones the two lists omit**, and deliberately so:
  $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ with $a < b$ are neither open nor closed as subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The radius depends on the point.** Openness asks for *some* $\varepsilon$
  at each point, and that $\varepsilon$ may shrink to nothing as the point
  approaches the edge of the set, as the computation for $(a,b)$ shows: there
  $\delta = \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ tends to $0$ as $x$ tends to either endpoint.
  Asking instead for a single $\varepsilon$ that works simultaneously at every
  point of the set is a strictly stronger condition, and it is not what is
  defined here; nothing on this page uses it.

## Definition

Let $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with open sets as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

- An **open cover** of $K$ is a family $\mathcal{U}$ of open subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$ with $K \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{U}$.
- A **subcover** of $\mathcal{U}$ is a subfamily $\mathcal{V} \subseteq
  \mathcal{U}$ that is still an open cover of $K$.
- A subfamily $\mathcal{V} \subseteq \mathcal{U}$ is **finite** when
  $\mathcal{V} = \varnothing$ or there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and members
  $U_0, \dots, U_n$ of $\mathcal{U}$ with $\mathcal{V} = \{U_0, \dots, U_n\}$;
  repetitions in the list are allowed and harmless.
- $K$ is **compact** when every open cover of $K$ has a finite subcover:
  for every open cover $\mathcal{U}$ of $K$, either $K = \varnothing$ and the
  empty subfamily covers it, or there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
  $U_0, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{U}$ with
  $$K \subseteq U_0 \cup \dots \cup U_n .$$
- $K$ is **sequentially compact** when every sequence $(x_k)$ of reals with
  $x_k \in K$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-sequence]]) has a subsequence
  converging ([[def-real-limit]]) to some point of $K$; equivalently, when every
  such sequence has a subsequential limit ([[def-subsequential-limit]]) that
  lies in $K$.

**Compactness is a property of $K$ alone.** The covering families range over open
subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, not over sets open in some other ambient space, so the
notion defined here is compactness of $K$ as a subset of $\mathbb{R}$. Nothing
below relativises it to a smaller ambient field; where an ordered field other
than $\mathbb{R}$ is meant, as in
[[fs-closed-bounded-compact-without-completeness]], the whole vocabulary is set
up again there for that field.

**$\varnothing$ is compact and sequentially compact.** The empty subfamily covers
it, and there is no sequence with all terms in $\varnothing$, so both conditions
hold vacuously.

## Remarks

- **Why "finite" is spelled out by listing.** A finite subfamily is described
  here as one that can be written $\{U_0, \dots, U_n\}$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}$,
  which is exactly the form every proof on this page produces or consumes: the
  bisection argument of [[thm-heine-borel-r]] produces a one-member list, and
  the arguments of [[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]] consume a list by
  taking a maximum over it ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]). Since $\mathbb{N}$
  contains $0$, the shortest nonempty list is $\{U_0\}$.

- **The two notions are not defined to be equivalent, and their equivalence is a
  theorem.** For subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ it is
  [[thm-compact-iff-sequentially-compact-r]]; both of its implications run
  through the characterisation of compactness by closed and bounded, and its
  forward implication additionally uses Bolzano-Weierstrass. Neither implication
  is formal.

- **Compactness is not inherited by subsets, but by closed subsets.** A closed
  subset of a compact set is compact, which is immediate from
  [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]] once that is available, whereas
  $(0,1) \subseteq [0,1]$ shows that an arbitrary subset of a compact set need
  not be compact.

- **The empty cover.** If $K \ne \varnothing$ then no open cover of $K$ is
  empty, so the case distinction in the definition of compactness only ever
  matters for $K = \varnothing$; it is written out so that the definition does
  not quietly assume $K$ nonempty.

## Definition

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ ([[def-field]]) together with a subset
$P \subseteq F$, the set of **positive** elements (the *positive cone*),
satisfying:

- **(O1) Trichotomy.** For each $x \in F$, exactly one of the following holds:
  $x \in P$, or $x = 0$, or $-x \in P$.
- **(O2) Closure.** If $x, y \in P$ then $x + y \in P$ and $x \cdot y \in P$.

We write $x > 0$ for $x \in P$ (read "$x$ is positive"), and define the order by

$$a < b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; b - a \in P, \qquad a \le b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; a < b \text{ or } a = b.$$

Thus $a > b$ means $b < a$, and $a \ge b$ means $b \le a$. An element $x$ with
$-x \in P$ (equivalently $x < 0$) is called **negative**.

## Remarks

- By trichotomy applied to $b - a$, for any $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$,
  $a = b$, $a > b$ holds; this makes $\le$ a total order.
- (O2) says the positives are closed under addition and multiplication: sums and
  products of positives are positive.
- The rationals ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and both constructions of the reals
  ([[thm-reals-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-dedekind-ordered-field]]) are ordered
  fields, so every fact proved here from (O1)-(O2) holds in each of them.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$. All suprema and
infima below are taken in the extended real line
$\overline{\mathbb{R}} = \mathbb{R} \cup \{-\infty, +\infty\}$
([[def-extended-reals]]), where **every** subset has a least upper bound and a
greatest lower bound ([[lem-extended-reals-complete]]); no boundedness
hypothesis on $f$ is therefore needed anywhere, and none is imposed.

**Oscillation on a set.** For $S \subseteq A$ put

$$\omega_f(S) \;:=\; \sup\{\, |f(x) - f(y)| \;:\; x, y \in S \,\} \;\in\; \overline{\mathbb{R}} .$$

**Oscillation at a point.** For $c \in A$ put

$$\omega_f(c) \;:=\; \inf\{\, \omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c)) \;:\; \delta \in \mathbb{R},\ \delta > 0 \,\} \;\in\; \overline{\mathbb{R}},$$

where $N_\delta(c) = (c - \delta, c + \delta)$ is the $\delta$-neighbourhood of
$c$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

The two uses of the symbol $\omega_f$ are distinguished by their argument: a
subset of $A$ in the first, a point of $A$ in the second. Where confusion is
possible the first is written $\omega_f(S)$ with $S$ named as a set.

### Both values are well posed; point oscillation and nonempty-set oscillation are nonnegative

**The set in the first display is nonempty whenever $S$ is**, since $x = y \in S$
gives the value $|f(x) - f(x)| = 0$; so $\omega_f(S) \ge 0$ for nonempty $S$,
and $\omega_f(S) = \sup \varnothing = -\infty$ for $S = \varnothing$
([[lem-extended-reals-complete]]). Only nonempty $S$ occurs below.

**The set in the second display is nonempty**, since some real $\delta > 0$
exists, and each of its members is $\ge 0$: for $c \in A$ the set
$A \cap N_\delta(c)$ contains $c$ itself, because $|c - c| = 0 < \delta$, so it
is nonempty and $\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c)) \ge 0$
([[lem-of-abs-value]]). Hence $0$ is a lower bound of that set and

$$0 \;\le\; \omega_f(c) \;\le\; \omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c)) \qquad \text{for every real } \delta > 0,$$

the second inequality because $\omega_f(c)$ is a lower bound of the set of which
$\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c))$ is a member. In particular $\omega_f(c)$ is never
$-\infty$.

### Monotonicity, and the case of a bounded $f$

**$\omega_f$ is monotone under inclusion.** If $S \subseteq T \subseteq A$ then
every value $|f(x) - f(y)|$ with $x, y \in S$ is also a value with $x, y \in T$,
so the first set of values is contained in the second and
$\omega_f(S) \le \omega_f(T)$: a supremum of a subset is at most the supremum of
the set. Consequently $\delta \mapsto \omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c))$ is
nondecreasing in $\delta$, since $\delta \le \delta'$ gives
$N_\delta(c) \subseteq N_{\delta'}(c)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

**When $f$ is bounded, nonempty-set and point oscillations are real.** Suppose
there is a real $M$ with $|f(x)| \le M$ for every $x \in A$
([[def-bounded-set]]). Then for $x, y \in A$,

$$|f(x) - f(y)| \;\le\; |f(x)| + |f(y)| \;\le\; 2M$$

([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]), so $\omega_f(S) \le 2M$
for every $S \subseteq A$. If
$S$ is nonempty, $\omega_f(S)$ is a real number in $[0,2M]$, and every point
oscillation is also a real number in $[0,2M]$: the supremum of a nonempty
subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$ is the real
supremum ([[lem-extended-reals-complete]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]],
[[def-infimum]]). The convention $\omega_f(\varnothing)=-\infty$ remains the
single empty-set exception. Apart from that exception, an infinite extended
value can occur only when $f$ is unbounded.

**The notation.** The letter is $\omega$ throughout this library, never
"$\operatorname{osc}$", and the function is always in the subscript.

## Definition

**Standing hypothesis for this page.** Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete
ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]),
$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers and **contains $0$**
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[def-nat-order]]), $\iota : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$
is the canonical natural ([[def-canonical-natural]]), and $a, b$ are reals with

$$a \;<\; b .$$

Intervals and their lengths are those of [[def-interval]]; finite sums are those
of [[def-finite-sum]], indexed as $\sum_{i<n}$ over $i \in \mathbb{N}$.

### Partitions

A **partition of $[a,b]$** is a pair $P = (n, t)$ consisting of a natural number
$n \ge 1$ and a sequence $t : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-sequence]]) with

$$t_0 = a, \qquad t_i < t_{i+1} \ \text{ for every } i < n, \qquad t_k = b \ \text{ for every } k \ge n .$$

The tail convention on the third clause is bookkeeping only: it makes $t$ a
genuine sequence, so that the finite-sum laws of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] apply to
it verbatim, and it costs nothing because no index above $n$ is ever read. The
first two clauses say exactly that

$$a \;=\; t_0 \;<\; t_1 \;<\; \dots \;<\; t_n \;=\; b ,$$

the last equality because $t_n = b$ by the third clause. In particular
$i \mapsto t_i$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on
$\{\, i \in \mathbb{N} : i \le n \,\}$ ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]),
and $a \le t_i \le b$ for every $i \le n$.

The **point set** of $P$ is the finite set

$$\operatorname{pts}(P) \;:=\; \{\, t_i \ : \ i \le n \,\} \;\subseteq\; [a,b], \qquad a, b \in \operatorname{pts}(P) .$$

The **subintervals** of $P$ are

$$I_i \;:=\; [\,t_i,\ t_{i+1}\,] \qquad (i < n),$$

and their **lengths** are $\Delta_i := t_{i+1} - t_i$. Each $\Delta_i > 0$, so
each $I_i$ is a nondegenerate closed bounded interval ([[def-interval]]). There
are $n$ of them and they are indexed from $i = 0$, not from $i = 1$: the first
subinterval is $[t_0, t_1] = [a, t_1]$.

**The lengths sum to $b - a$.** By the telescoping law, clause 5 of
[[lem-finite-sum-laws]],

$$\sum_{i<n} \Delta_i \;=\; \sum_{i<n} (t_{i+1} - t_i) \;=\; t_n - t_0 \;=\; b - a .$$

**The mesh.** The set $\{\, \Delta_i : i < n \,\}$ is a nonempty finite set of
reals, nonempty because $n \ge 1$, so it has a maximum
([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]). The **mesh** of $P$ is

$$\|P\| \;:=\; \max\{\, \Delta_i \ : \ i < n \,\} \;>\; 0 ,$$

and $\Delta_i \le \|P\|$ for every $i < n$.

**The uniform partition.** For a natural $N \ge 1$, the **uniform partition of
$[a,b]$ into $N$ parts** is $U_N := (N, t)$ with

$$t_i \;:=\; a + \iota(i)\,\frac{b-a}{\iota(N)} \quad (i \le N), \qquad t_k := b \quad (k \ge N).$$

This is a partition: $t_0 = a$; $t_N = a + (b-a) = b$; and $t_{i+1} - t_i =
(b-a)/\iota(N) > 0$ for $i < N$, because $\iota(N) > 0$ and $\iota(i+1) =
\iota(i) + 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[def-canonical-natural]]). Its
subinterval lengths are all equal to $(b-a)/\iota(N)$, so

$$\|U_N\| \;=\; \frac{b-a}{\iota(N)} .$$

### A partition is determined by its point set

**Claim.** If $P = (n,t)$ and $P' = (n', t')$ are partitions of $[a,b]$ with
$\operatorname{pts}(P) = \operatorname{pts}(P')$, then $n = n'$ and $t_i = t'_i$
for every $i \le n$.

*Proof.* First, $t_i = t'_i$ for every $i \le \min\{n,n'\}$, by induction on $i$
([[thm-induction-principle]]). For $i = 0$ both equal $a$. Suppose $t_j = t'_j$
for all $j \le i$ and $i + 1 \le \min\{n,n'\}$. The set
$S := \{\, x \in \operatorname{pts}(P) : x > t_i \,\}$ has $t_{i+1}$ as its least
element: $t_{i+1} \in S$, and any $x \in S$ is $t_j$ for some $j \le n$ with
$t_j > t_i$, which forces $j > i$ because $t$ is increasing on indices $\le n$,
hence $j \ge i+1$ and $x = t_j \ge t_{i+1}$. The same argument in $P'$ makes
$t'_{i+1}$ the least element of
$\{\, x \in \operatorname{pts}(P') : x > t'_i \,\}$, which is the same set $S$,
since the point sets agree and $t'_i = t_i$. A set has at most one least element
([[def-max-min]]), so $t_{i+1} = t'_{i+1}$.

Second, $n = n'$. If $n < n'$ then $t'_n = t_n = b$ by the previous paragraph,
while $t'_n < t'_{n'} = b$ because $t'$ is increasing on indices $\le n'$ and
$n < n'$; that is impossible. Exchanging the roles of $P$ and $P'$ rules out
$n' < n$. $\square$

So the map $P \mapsto \operatorname{pts}(P)$ is injective, and a partition may be
named by its point set whenever one is exhibited.

### Inserting a point

Let $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ and let $c \in [a,b]$. Define a
partition $P + c$ of $[a,b]$ as follows.

- If $c \in \operatorname{pts}(P)$, put $P + c := P$.
- Otherwise $c \ne a$ and $c \ne b$, so $a < c < b$. The set
  $T := \{\, t_i : i \le n \text{ and } t_i < c \,\}$ is a nonempty finite set of
  reals, nonempty because $t_0 = a < c$, so it has a maximum
  ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]); let $i_0 \le n$ be the unique index with
  $t_{i_0} = \max T$, unique because $t$ is injective on indices $\le n$. Then
  $i_0 < n$, since $t_n = b > c$ puts $t_n \notin T$; and
  $$t_{i_0} \;<\; c \;<\; t_{i_0+1},$$
  the right inequality because $t_{i_0+1} \ne c$ (as $c \notin \operatorname{pts}(P)$)
  and $t_{i_0+1} < c$ would put $t_{i_0+1} \in T$ with $t_{i_0+1} > t_{i_0} = \max T$.
  Put $P + c := (n+1, s)$ with
  $$s_i := t_i \ (i \le i_0), \qquad s_{i_0+1} := c, \qquad s_i := t_{i-1} \ (i_0 + 2 \le i \le n+1), \qquad s_k := b \ (k \ge n+1).$$

In both cases $P + c$ is a partition of $[a,b]$ and

$$\operatorname{pts}(P + c) \;=\; \operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \{c\}, \qquad \|P+c\| \;\le\; \|P\| .$$

The displayed identity is immediate from the two cases. For the mesh: in the
first case nothing changes; in the second the list of subinterval lengths of
$P + c$ is that of $P$ with $\Delta_{i_0}$ replaced by the two numbers
$c - t_{i_0}$ and $t_{i_0+1} - c$, each of which is smaller than
$\Delta_{i_0} = (c - t_{i_0}) + (t_{i_0+1} - c)$ because the other is positive.
So every length of $P + c$ is at most a length of $P$, and the maximum cannot
increase. Finally the index count grows by exactly $1$ in the second case and
not at all in the first.

### Refinement and the common refinement

$P'$ **refines** $P$, and is a **refinement** of $P$, when

$$\operatorname{pts}(P) \;\subseteq\; \operatorname{pts}(P') .$$

Let $P = (n,t)$ and $Q = (m,s)$ be partitions of $[a,b]$. Applying the recursion
theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) to the set $\mathbb{N} \times \mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$,
where $\mathcal{P}_{[a,b]}$ is the set of partitions of $[a,b]$, with starting
element $(0, P)$ and the map $(j, R) \mapsto (j+1,\ R + s_j)$ — legitimate
because $s_j \in [a,b]$ for every $j \in \mathbb{N}$ — gives a unique family
$(R_j)_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ of partitions with $R_0 = P$ and $R_{j+1} = R_j + s_j$.
The **common refinement** of $P$ and $Q$ is

$$P \vee Q \;:=\; R_{m+1} .$$

**Its point set is the union.** By induction on $j$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]),
$\operatorname{pts}(R_j) = \operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \{\, s_l : l < j \,\}$;
taking $j = m+1$ gives

$$\operatorname{pts}(P \vee Q) \;=\; \operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \operatorname{pts}(Q).$$

Hence $P \vee Q$ refines both $P$ and $Q$; by the uniqueness claim above it is
the **only** partition with that point set, so $P \vee Q = Q \vee P$, and

$$P' \text{ refines } P \quad \Longrightarrow \quad P \vee P' = P' ,$$

since then $\operatorname{pts}(P) \cup \operatorname{pts}(P') =
\operatorname{pts}(P')$.

**Two size bounds, both used later.** Writing $n_R$ for the first component of a
partition $R$:

$$\|P \vee Q\| \;\le\; \|P\|, \qquad n_{P \vee Q} \;\le\; n_P + n_Q - 1 .$$

The first is the mesh bound above applied $m+1$ times. For the second, each
insertion raises the index count by at most $1$, and the two insertions of
$s_0 = a$ and $s_m = b$ raise it by $0$, since $a$ and $b$ already lie in
$\operatorname{pts}(P)$ and hence in $\operatorname{pts}(R_j)$ for every $j$; so
at most $m - 1$ of the $m+1$ insertions increase it.

### The index map of a refinement

Let $P' = (n',t')$ refine $P = (n,t)$. For each $i \le n$ the point $t_i$ lies in
$\operatorname{pts}(P')$, so there is exactly one $\varphi(i) \le n'$ with
$t'_{\varphi(i)} = t_i$, uniqueness because $t'$ is injective on indices $\le n'$.
The resulting map $\varphi$ satisfies

$$\varphi(0) = 0, \qquad \varphi(n) = n', \qquad \varphi(i) < \varphi(i+1) \ \ (i < n),$$

the first two because $t'_0 = a = t_0$ and $t'_{n'} = b = t_n$ together with
injectivity, and the third because $t_i < t_{i+1}$ and $t'$ is increasing on
indices $\le n'$. In particular $n \le n'$. Moreover, for $i < n$ and
$\varphi(i) \le j < \varphi(i+1)$,

$$I'_j \;=\; [\,t'_j,\ t'_{j+1}\,] \;\subseteq\; [\,t_i,\ t_{i+1}\,] \;=\; I_i ,$$

because $t_i = t'_{\varphi(i)} \le t'_j$ and $t'_{j+1} \le t'_{\varphi(i+1)} = t_{i+1}$.

**The blocks are counted by telescoping.** By clause 5 of
[[lem-finite-sum-laws]],
$\sum_{i<n}\big(\varphi(i+1) - \varphi(i)\big) = \varphi(n) - \varphi(0) = n'$,
so, subtracting $\sum_{i<n} 1 = n$,

$$\sum_{i<n} \big(\varphi(i+1) - \varphi(i) - 1\big) \;=\; n' - n ,$$

a sum of $n$ nonnegative integers, one for each block, which vanishes exactly at
the blocks consisting of a single index. This identity is the whole content of
the quantitative bound in [[lem-refinement-inequalities]], and it is also why
$n \le n'$.

Finally, the lengths inside a block sum to the length of the block:

$$\sum_{j = \varphi(i)}^{\varphi(i+1)-1} \Delta'_j \;=\; t'_{\varphi(i+1)} - t'_{\varphi(i)} \;=\; t_{i+1} - t_i \;=\; \Delta_i \qquad (i < n),$$

again by telescoping, applied to the sequence $l \mapsto t'_{\varphi(i)+l}$ and
read through the index-shift convention of [[def-finite-sum]].

## Remarks

- **Why $a < b$ is a standing hypothesis and not a case.** With $a = b$ the
  displayed chain $a = t_0 < \dots < t_n = b$ is unsatisfiable for $n \ge 1$, and
  admitting $n = 0$ would give a partition with no subintervals, an empty mesh
  set and no maximum. Every statement on this page is about a nondegenerate
  closed bounded interval, and the convention $\int_a^a f := 0$ is not adopted
  here because nothing below needs it.

- **The subintervals overlap at their shared endpoints, and that is harmless.**
  $I_i \cap I_{i+1} = \{t_{i+1}\}$, so the union $\bigcup_{i<n} I_i = [a,b]$ is
  not disjoint. Every quantity attached to a partition below is a sum over $i<n$
  of a number times $\Delta_i$, and a single point contributes length $0$, so no
  statement on this page is sensitive to the double counting of the $n-1$
  interior points.

- **Refinement is a relation between point sets, not between lists.** Defining it
  as "$P'$ is obtained from $P$ by inserting points" would be the same relation,
  by the uniqueness claim above, but it would make every proof carry an
  insertion order. The index map $\varphi$ recovers the list-level picture when
  it is wanted, and it is what [[lem-refinement-inequalities]] actually uses.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]],
[[def-real-numbers]]) with its order and absolute value ([[def-real-order]]), and
$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers with its order ([[def-natural-numbers]],
[[def-nat-order]]).

A **sequence of reals** is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$. We write
$x_k$ for the value $x(k)$, call it the **$k$-th term**, and write $(x_k)$, or
$(x_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$, for the function itself. The **range** of $(x_k)$ is
the subset $\{\, x_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals and let $P$ be a property of indices.

- $(x_k)$ is **bounded** if there is $M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for
  every $k \in \mathbb{N}$; it is **unbounded** otherwise.
- $P$ holds **eventually** if there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $P(k)$ holds
  for every $k \ge K$.
- $P$ holds **frequently** if for every $K \in \mathbb{N}$ there is some
  $k \ge K$ for which $P(k)$ holds.
- For $K \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$K$-th tail** of $(x_k)$ is the sequence
  $x^{(K)}$ defined by $x^{(K)}_j := x_{j + K}$ for $j \in \mathbb{N}$; it is
  again a sequence of reals.
- A function $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is **strictly increasing** if
  $n_j < n_k$ whenever $j < k$. For such an $n$, the **subsequence** of $(x_k)$
  along $n$ is the composite $x \circ n$, written $(x_{n_k})_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$;
  it is again a sequence of reals.

**Convergence and Cauchyness are not defined here.** They are already fixed, for
sequences of reals, by the published [[def-real-limit]]: $(x_k)$ *converges* to
$x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is
$K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$, and $(x_k)$
is *Cauchy* when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$
with $|x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$. This page builds the
toolkit for those two notions and does not restate them. A sequence
**converges** if it converges to some real, and **diverges** if it does not.

## Remarks

- **Identification of $\mathbb{Q}$ with its image.** The map $q \mapsto \hat q$
  is an embedding of ordered fields ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and as is
  standard we write $q$ for $\hat q$, so that a rational may be compared with a
  real without further comment. [[def-real-limit]] is stated with the hat; every
  rational $\varepsilon$ occurring on this page is its image under this
  embedding.

- **Rational and real $\varepsilon$ agree.** [[def-real-limit]] tests convergence
  against every *rational* $\varepsilon > 0$, and its own remark records that
  this loses nothing. Spelled out: suppose that for every rational
  $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all
  $k \ge K$, and let $\eta > 0$ be an arbitrary *real*. Since $0 < \eta$,
  density of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) supplies a
  rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, and the index $K$
  belonging to that $\varepsilon$ satisfies $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon < \eta$ for
  all $k \ge K$. The converse implication is immediate, since every positive
  rational is a positive real. So the two formulations define the same relation,
  and the same two lines apply verbatim to the Cauchy condition and to any
  condition of the shape "for every $\varepsilon > 0$, eventually
  $\cdots < \varepsilon$". Proofs on this page therefore run the test with a real
  $\varepsilon$ wherever that is more convenient, and say so by citing this
  remark; nothing is smuggled in.

- **Constant sequences converge.** For $c \in \mathbb{R}$ the constant sequence
  $x_k := c$ converges to $c$, because $|x_k - c| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ for
  every $\varepsilon > 0$ and every $k$; it is bounded by $|c|$.

- **Eventually and frequently are dual.** $P$ holds frequently exactly when
  $\lnot P$ does not hold eventually, and $P$ holds eventually exactly when
  $\lnot P$ does not hold frequently. So the two quantifier patterns are
  negations of one another applied to the complementary property, and there is no
  third pattern hiding between them.

- **A sequence is not its range.** $(x_k)$ is a function, not a set, and the
  range does not determine the function: the sequence $x_0 = 0$, $x_k = 1$ for
  $k \ge 1$ and the sequence $y_0 = y_1 = 0$, $y_k = 1$ for $k \ge 2$ have the
  same range $\{0, 1\}$, yet they differ at $k = 1$, so they are different
  sequences. Order and repetition are part of the data and the range forgets
  both. Boundedness, on the other hand, depends only on the range.

- **Indexing.** Sequences here start at $k = 0$ because $\mathbb{N}$ contains
  $0$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]). Texts that index from $1$ describe the same
  objects up to a shift, and the shift changes nothing about convergence, by
  [[lem-limit-of-tail]].

## Statement

**False claim:** a bounded function $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is Riemann
integrable on $[a,b]$ ([[def-darboux-integral]]) **if and only if** its set of
discontinuities is nowhere dense ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]],
[[def-continuity-real]]).

The claim replaces the correct smallness condition, measure zero
([[thm-lebesgue-criterion]]), by the smallness condition of category. The two are
independent, and the implication that fails below is the one from "nowhere dense"
to "integrable": the indicator of the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set
([[def-fat-cantor-set]]) is discontinuous exactly on a **closed nowhere dense**
set and is not integrable, because that set cannot be covered by intervals of
small total length.

The other implication fails too, and more cheaply: Thomae's function is
integrable and its discontinuity set is $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$, which is dense
in $[0,1]$ and therefore not nowhere dense. One failing direction refutes the
biconditional, and the harder one is worked out below.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The Smith-Volterra-Cantor set $S \subseteq [0,1]$ ([[def-fat-cantor-set]]) and its indicator $g : [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$, with $g(x) = 1$ for $x \in S$ and $g(x) = 0$ for $x \in [0,1]\setminus S$.

[A1] The false claim, in the direction used here: if a bounded $f$ on $[a,b]$ has a nowhere dense set of discontinuities, then $f$ is Riemann integrable.

[L1] $S$ is closed and bounded and nowhere dense, and if $(a_k)$, $(b_k)$ are sequences of reals with $a_k \le b_k$, $S \subseteq \bigcup_k [a_k,b_k]$ and $\sum_{k<i}(b_k-a_k) \le M$ for every $i \in \mathbb{N}$, then $M \ge 2^{-1}$; in particular $S$ does not have measure zero ([[thm-fat-cantor-set-has-positive-measure]], [[def-fat-cantor-set]], [[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

[L2] A set $A$ is nowhere dense when the interior of $\overline{A}$ is empty; for closed $A$ this says that $A$ contains no nonempty open set, equivalently that every neighbourhood of every point contains a point outside $A$ ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L3] A set is closed exactly when its complement is open, that is, when every point outside it has a neighbourhood missing it ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L4] For a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[0,1]$: $n \ge 1$, $\Delta_i > 0$, $\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = 1$, $I_i = [t_i,t_{i+1}]$, and $[0,1] = \bigcup_{i<n} I_i$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-interval]]).

[L5] $L(g,P) = \sum_{i<n}m_i\Delta_i$, $U(g,P) = \sum_{i<n}M_i\Delta_i$ with $m_i = \inf g[I_i]$ and $M_i = \sup g[I_i]$; $\underline{\int_0^1} g$ is the supremum of the lower sums and $\overline{\int_0^1} g$ the infimum of the upper sums; $g$ is integrable exactly when they agree ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L6] A set with a least element has it as its infimum and one with a greatest element has it as its supremum ([[def-infimum]], [[def-max-min]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L7] Finite sums: scaling, splitting, monotonicity in the terms, and $\sum_{i<n}0 = 0$; a finite list may be extended to a sequence by degenerate intervals of length $0$ without changing any partial total ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

[L8] Ordered-field arithmetic: the order is total, so any two reals have a maximum and a minimum; adding a constant preserves an inequality. For $0 \le x \le 1$ and a real $\rho > 0$, the reals $u := \max\{0, x-\rho\}$ and $v := \min\{1, x+\rho\}$ satisfy $u < v$, by checking the four cases of which member each of the two attains, and $(u,v) \subseteq N_\rho(x)\cap[0,1]$, since $z \in (u,v)$ gives $x - \rho \le u < z < v \le x + \rho$ and $0 \le u < z < v \le 1$ ([[def-max-min]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-interval]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $g$ is bounded, taking only the values $0$ and $1$, so its Darboux sums and integrals are defined by [L5]. [given, L5]

1.2 **$g$ is discontinuous at every point of $S$.** Let $x \in S$, so $g(x) = 1$, and let a real $\rho > 0$ be given. Put $u := \max\{0,\ x-\rho\}$ and $v := \min\{1,\ x+\rho\}$; then $u < v$ because $0 \le x \le 1$ and $\rho > 0$, and $(u,v) \subseteq N_\rho(x) \cap [0,1]$ by [L8]. Since $S$ is closed and nowhere dense it contains no nonempty open set by [L1] and [L2], so there is $y \in (u,v)$ with $y \notin S$. Then $y \in [0,1]$, $|y - x| < \rho$ and $|g(x)-g(y)| = 1$, so the continuity condition fails at $x$ for $\varepsilon := 1$. [given, L1, L2, L6, L8]

1.3 **$g$ is continuous at every point of $[0,1] \setminus S$.** Let $x \in [0,1]$ with $x \notin S$. Since $S$ is closed, [L3] gives a real $\rho > 0$ with $N_\rho(x) \cap S = \varnothing$, so $g$ vanishes identically on $N_\rho(x)\cap[0,1]$ and $|g(y)-g(x)| = 0 < \varepsilon$ there, for every $\varepsilon > 0$. [given, L1, L3]

2.1 So the set of discontinuities of $g$ in $[0,1]$ is exactly $S$, which is nowhere dense by [L1]. [step 1.2, step 1.3, L1]

2.2 **Every upper Darboux sum of $g$ is at least $2^{-1}$.** Let $P = (n,t)$ be a partition of $[0,1]$ and let $B := \{\, i < n : I_i \cap S \ne \varnothing \,\}$. For $i \in B$ the set $g[I_i]$ contains $1$, so $M_i = 1$ by [L6] and $g \le 1$; for $i \notin B$ one has $g[I_i] = \{0\}$ and $M_i = 0$. Hence $U(g,P) = \sum_{i<n}M_i\Delta_i$ is the sum of the $\Delta_i$ with $i \in B$, by [L5] and [L7]. [step 1.1, L5, L6, L7]

2.3 **Every lower Darboux sum of $g$ is $0$.** With $P$ as above and $i < n$: $t_i < t_{i+1}$ by [L4], so $(t_i,t_{i+1})$ is a nonempty open subset of $[0,1]$, and by [L1] and [L2] it is not contained in $S$; a point of it outside $S$ lies in $I_i \cap [0,1]$ and has $g$-value $0$, so $g[I_i]$ contains $0$ and $m_i = 0$ by [L6], $g$ being nonnegative. Hence $L(g,P) = 0$ by [L5] and [L7]. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L4, L5, L6, L7]

3.1 The intervals $I_i$ with $i \in B$ cover $S$: a point of $S$ lies in $[0,1] = \bigcup_{i<n}I_i$ by [L4], hence in some $I_i$, and that $i$ is in $B$. Extending this finite list of closed intervals to a sequence by degenerate intervals $[0,0]$ ([L7]) gives a cover of $S$ all of whose partial total lengths are at most $U(g,P)$, so [L1] gives $U(g,P) \ge 2^{-1}$. [step 2.2, L1, L4, L7]

4.1 Therefore $\underline{\int_0^1} g = 0$ by [L6] and step 2.3, while $\overline{\int_0^1} g \ge 2^{-1}$ by step 3.1, since every upper sum is at least $2^{-1}$ and the infimum of such a set is at least $2^{-1}$. The two differ, so $g$ is not Riemann integrable by [L5]. [step 3.1, step 2.3, L5, L6]

5.1 So $g$ is a bounded function on $[0,1]$ whose set of discontinuities is nowhere dense and which is not Riemann integrable; [A1] fails at $g$, and with it the claimed equivalence. [step 2.1, step 4.1, A1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the false claim comes from.** For a **closed** discontinuity set, being nowhere dense and being null are both ways of saying "small", and for the Cantor set they agree. They come apart exactly because a nowhere dense closed set may still swallow a fixed fraction of the length of every interval it meets, which is what the Smith-Volterra-Cantor construction arranges: it removes a middle interval of length $4^{-n}$ at stage $n$ rather than a fixed proportion ([[def-fat-cantor-set]]).

- **The correct statement is measure zero, in both directions.** That is [[thm-lebesgue-criterion]], and it explains both failures at once: $S$ is nowhere dense and not null, so $g$ is not integrable; $\mathbb{Q}\cap[0,1]$ is dense and null, so Thomae's function is integrable ([[fs-nonnegative-integrable-with-zero-integral-vanishes]]).

- **Nothing here uses any choice principle.** The non-integrability of $g$ is proved directly from claim 4 of [[thm-fat-cantor-set-has-positive-measure]], which is a statement about interval covers, rather than through the forward half of [[thm-lebesgue-criterion]], which spends countable choice. See [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].

## Statement

If $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ has content zero
([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]) then $A$ has measure zero.

The converse is false in general, and true for compact sets
([[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]]); the witness for its failure is named in
the remarks below.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ of content zero and a real $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] $A$ has content zero when for every real $\eta > 0$ there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and reals $a_0 \le b_0, \dots, a_n \le b_n$ with $A \subseteq \bigcup_{j \le n}[a_j,b_j]$ and $\sum_{j \le n}(b_j - a_j) \le \eta$; $A$ is null when for every real $\eta > 0$ there are sequences with the analogous properties and $\sum_{k<i}(b_k - a_k) \le \eta$ for every $i \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

[L2] $[c,c] = \{c\}$ is an interval of length $0$, and $[c,d]$ has length $d - c \ge 0$ for $c \le d$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L3] Finite sums: $\sum_{k<i} t_k = \sum_{k<n+1} t_k + \sum_{k=n+1}^{i-1} t_k$ for $n + 1 \le i$, a sum of nonnegative terms is nonnegative and is monotone in the number of nonnegative terms adjoined, and $\sum_{k<i} t_k \le \sum_{k<n+1} t_k$ whenever $i \le n+1$ and the terms are nonnegative ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[def-series]]).

[L4] Ordered-field arithmetic: adding a nonnegative quantity does not decrease a value, and the order is transitive ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let the real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given; since $A$ has content zero, [L1] supplies $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and reals $a_0 \le b_0, \dots, a_n \le b_n$ with $A \subseteq \bigcup_{j \le n}[a_j,b_j]$ and $\sum_{j \le n}(b_j - a_j) \le \varepsilon$. [given, L1, choose]

2.1 Extend the finite list to sequences by putting $a_k := 0$ and $b_k := 0$ for $k > n$; then $a_k \le b_k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, the added intervals $[0,0]$ have length $0$ by [L2], and $A \subseteq \bigcup_{j \le n}[a_j,b_j] \subseteq \bigcup_{k \in \mathbb{N}}[a_k,b_k]$. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 For every $i \in \mathbb{N}$ one has $\sum_{k<i}(b_k - a_k) \le \varepsilon$: all the terms are nonnegative by [L2], so for $i \le n+1$ the sum is at most $\sum_{k<n+1}(b_k - a_k) = \sum_{j \le n}(b_j - a_j) \le \varepsilon$ by [L3] and step 1.1, and for $i > n+1$ the sum equals $\sum_{k<n+1}(b_k - a_k)$ plus a sum of terms all equal to $0$, hence is again at most $\varepsilon$, by [L3] and [L4]. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L2, L3, L4]

4.1 So for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a sequence of closed intervals covering $A$ with every partial total length at most $\varepsilon$, which by [L1] is exactly the statement that $A$ has measure zero. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **All that is used is that a finite list can be padded.** The definition of
  measure zero asks for a sequence, and a finite family becomes one at the cost
  of degenerate intervals, which are intervals of length $0$
  ([[def-interval]]). No estimate is involved and no completeness of $\mathbb{R}$
  is used.

- **The implication is strict.** $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$ is null and bounded and
  does not have content zero ([[fs-null-implies-content-zero]],
  [[cex-null-set-not-of-content-zero]]), so the two notions are genuinely
  different even for bounded sets. What closes the gap is compactness, not
  boundedness ([[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]]).

## Statement

Let $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be sequences of reals, let
$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, and let $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, with finite sums and
finite products as in [[def-finite-sum]]. Then:

1. **Additivity.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k$.
2. **Scaling.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k$; in particular $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda = n\lambda$, where $n$ denotes the canonical natural $\iota(n) \in \mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).
3. **Splitting.** If $m \le n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k$, and $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n} a_k = \Big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k\Big)$.
4. **Monotonicity.** If $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$. In particular, if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, every single term satisfies $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$ for $j < n$, and $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ forces $a_k = 0$ for every $k < n$.
5. **Telescoping.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}\big(c_{k+1} - c_k\big) = c_n - c_0$.
6. **Products.** $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k) = \Big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\Big)$; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, and if $a_k > 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k > 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\lambda$, and naturals $m, n$. Write $\Sigma_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\Pi_n = \prod_{k<n} a_k$.

[L1] Recursion clauses ([[def-finite-sum]]): $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ and $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n$; $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1$ and $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) \cdot a_n$; and $\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k = \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j}$ for $m \le n$, likewise for products.

[L2] Field axioms: addition and multiplication are associative and commutative, $0$ and $1$ are the identities, $x - x = 0$, and multiplication distributes over addition ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]); and $0 \cdot x = 0$, which is not an axiom but a lemma ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

[L3] Induction principle: a property holding at $0$ and inherited by successors holds at every natural ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L4] Adding inequalities: $x \le y$ and $u \le v$ imply $x + u \le y + v$. [[lem-of-add-order]] states the STRICT forms and only those ($x < y \Rightarrow x + c < y + c$, and $x < y$ with $u < v$ giving $x + u < y + v$); the nonstrict form used throughout below is those two together with the cases $x = y$ and $u = v$, which are settled by trichotomy, the order being total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] The canonical embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a field homomorphism, so $\iota(0) = 0$ and $\iota(n+1) = \iota(n) + 1$, and $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L6] Sign rules: a product of two positives is positive ([[lem-of-sign-rules]], claim 1), and a product of two nonnegatives is nonnegative, since a factor equal to $0$ makes the product $0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]) and otherwise both factors are positive; and $1 > 0$, which is proved in [[cor-of-one-positive]] and stated by none of the items named above.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 0$: every claim holds at $n = 0$, since both sides of claim 1 are $0 = 0 + 0$, both sides of claim 2 are $0 = \lambda \cdot 0$ and $0 = \iota(0)\lambda$, claim 4 reads $0 \le 0$ with no term to bound and the hypothesis $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ giving nothing to prove, claim 5 reads $0 = c_0 - c_0$, and claim 6 reads $1 = 1 \cdot 1$ with $1 > 0$. [base, L1, L2, L5, L6]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for this $n$ and for all sequences $a, b, c$ and all $\lambda$. [ih]

1.3 Splitting, claim 3, by a separate induction on the number of trailing terms $d = n - m$ with $m$ fixed: for $d = 0$ the claim reads $\sum_{k<m} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + 0$ and $\prod_{k<m} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\big) \cdot 1$, which hold; and if $\sum_{k<m+d} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d} a_{m+j}$, then $\sum_{k<m+d+1} a_k = \sum_{k<m+d} a_k + a_{m+d} = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \big(\sum_{j<d} a_{m+j} + a_{m+d}\big) = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d+1} a_{m+j}$ by associativity, and identically for products with $1$ in place of $0$ and multiplication in place of addition, so induction on $d$ gives claim 3 for every $m \le n$. [L1, L2, L3]

2.1 Additivity at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k\big) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) + \big(\sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n\big) = \sum_{k<n+1} a_k + \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$, using the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of addition. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Scaling at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda a_k = \sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda\big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) = \lambda \sum_{k<n+1} a_k$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and distributivity; taking $a_k = 1$ for all $k$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda = \sum_{k<n} \lambda + \lambda = \iota(n)\lambda + \lambda = (\iota(n) + 1)\lambda = \iota(n+1)\lambda$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L5]

2.3 Monotonicity at $n+1$: assume $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n+1$; then $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$, so the hypothesis gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$, and adding the inequality $a_n \le b_n$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n \le \sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n = \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$. [step 1.2, L1, L4]

2.4 Telescoping at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(c_{k+1} - c_k) = \sum_{k<n}(c_{k+1} - c_k) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = (c_n - c_0) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = c_{n+1} - c_0$, by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and the field identities. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.5 Products at $n+1$: $\prod_{k<n+1}(a_k b_k) = \big(\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k)\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n+1} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n+1} b_k\big)$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of multiplication; and if every $a_k \ge 0$ for $k < n+1$ then $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) a_n$ is a product of two nonnegatives, hence nonnegative, with the same argument giving positivity from positivity since $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1 > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L6]

3.1 Consequences of monotonicity, completing claim 4: monotonicity itself holds at every $n$, by the induction principle applied to the base case of step 1.1 and the successor step 2.3, so it is available for an arbitrary $n$ in what follows; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then comparing with the zero sequence gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge \sum_{k<n} 0 = 0$; for $j < n$ splitting at $j$ and then at $j+1$ writes $\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<j} a_k + a_j + \sum_{k=j+1}^{n-1} a_k$ with the first and third summands $\ge 0$, so $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$; and if moreover $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ then $0 \le a_j \le 0$ for every $j < n$, so $a_j = 0$. [step 1.1, step 2.3, step 1.3, L3, L4, L2]

4.1 By the induction principle claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and claim 3 was proved in step 1.3 with its consequences in step 3.1, so all six laws hold. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, step 2.5, step 1.3, step 3.1, L3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$, with
$|x|$ the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]). Then

$$|x| \ge 0; \quad |x| = 0 \iff x = 0; \quad -|x| \le x \le |x|; \quad |-x| = |x|; \quad |xy| = |x|\,|y|;$$

and, for every $c > 0$, one has $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and elements $x, y \in F$.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| = u$ if $u \ge 0$, and $|u| = -u$ if $u < 0$ ([[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Ordered-field order: trichotomy holds (for each $u$ exactly one of $u > 0$, $u = 0$, $u < 0$), $a < b$ means $b - a$ is positive, and sums and products of positives are positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Signs in products: $(-a)b = -(ab)$ and $(-a)(-b) = ab$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] Sign rules: a product of two elements of the same sign is positive, and a product of two elements of opposite sign is negative ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Case $x > 0$: by [L1] $|x| = x > 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; since $-x < 0$ we get $|-x| = -(-x) = x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -x < 0 < x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case pos, L1, L2, algebra]

1.2 Case $x = 0$: then $|x| = |0| = 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ holds with $|x| = 0$ and $x = 0$, while $|-x| = |0| = |x|$ and $-|x| = 0 \le 0 \le 0 = |x|$. [assume-case zero, L1]

1.3 Case $x < 0$: by [L1] $|x| = -x$, and [L2] gives $-x > 0$, so $|x| > 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; here $|-x| = -x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -(-x) = x \le x$ while $x < 0 < -x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case neg, L1, L2, algebra]

1.4 Case $x = 0$ or $y = 0$: then $xy = 0$, so $|xy| = 0$, and one of $|x|, |y|$ is $0$, whence $|x|\,|y| = 0 = |xy|$. [assume-case zerofactor, L1]

1.5 Case $x, y$ have the same sign (both positive or both negative): by [L4] $xy > 0$, so $|xy| = xy$, while $|x|\,|y| = xy$ by [L3] (for $x, y < 0$ this is $(-x)(-y) = xy$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case same, L1, L3, L4]

1.6 Case $x, y$ have opposite signs (one positive, one negative): by [L4] $xy < 0$, so $|xy| = -(xy)$, while $|x|\,|y| = -(xy)$ by [L3] (namely $x(-y)$ or $(-x)y$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case opposite, L1, L3, L4]

2.1 By trichotomy [L2] each $x$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.1-1.3, and in each we verified $|x| \ge 0$, that $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$, that $|-x| = |x|$, and that $-|x| \le x \le |x|$; hence all four hold for every $x$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, cases-exhaustive]

2.2 By trichotomy [L2] each pair $x, y$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.4-1.6, and in each $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$ for all $x, y$. [step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6, cases-exhaustive]

3.1 Let $c > 0$: if $|x| < c$ then $-c < -|x| \le x \le |x| < c$ by [step 2.1] and [L2], so $-c < x < c$; conversely if $-c < x < c$ then both $x < c$ and $-x < c$, and since $|x|$ equals $x$ or $-x$ by [L1], we get $|x| < c$, so $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$. [step 2.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b, c, d \in F$.

1. **Translation invariance.** If $a < b$ then $a + c < b + c$.
2. **Adding inequalities.** If $a < b$ and $c < d$ then $a + c < b + d$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b, c, d \in F$.

[L1] For $x, y \in F$, the relation $x < y$ means $y - x \in P$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] $P$ is closed under addition: if $u, v \in P$ then $u + v \in P$ (axiom O2 of [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a < b$; by the definition of the order this means $b - a \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.2 For every $c \in F$ the field identities give $(b + c) - (a + c) = b - a$. [algebra]

1.3 Assume moreover $c < d$; by the definition of the order this means $d - c \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.4 The field identities give $(b + d) - (a + c) = (b - a) + (d - c)$. [algebra]

2.1 Hence $(b + c) - (a + c) = b - a \in P$, which is exactly $a + c < b + c$, proving claim 1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1]

2.2 Since $b - a \in P$ and $d - c \in P$, closure under addition gives $(b - a) + (d - c) \in P$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, L2]

3.1 Therefore $(b + d) - (a + c) = (b - a) + (d - c) \in P$, which is exactly $a + c < b + d$, proving claim 2. [step 1.4, step 2.2, L1] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field, with field structure as in [[def-field]], and for
$n \ge 1$ let $n \cdot 1_F$ denote the canonical natural number
$\underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$, defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$
and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$. Then for every $n \ge 1$:

- $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$;
- the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$;
- $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ and $(mn) \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F)$ for all $m, n \ge 1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ whose canonical naturals are defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, with $0 \cdot 1_F = 0$.

[L1] $0 < 1_F$ in every ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] The order is compatible with addition and positives are closed under addition: $a < b$ implies $a + c < b + c$, and $a > 0$, $b > 0$ imply $a + b > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 1$: by definition $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, and $1_F > 0$. [L1, base]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: assume $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for some fixed $n \ge 1$. [ih]

1.3 By the recursion, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F - n \cdot 1_F = 1_F > 0$, so $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$. [given, L1]

1.4 Additive identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ by the recursion, and if $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ then $(m+n+1) \cdot 1_F = (m+n) \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + (n+1) \cdot 1_F$. [given, algebra]

2.1 Inductive step: $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ is a sum of two positives, by the hypothesis and $1_F > 0$, hence $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Iterating 1.3, for $m < n$ one has $m \cdot 1_F < n \cdot 1_F$, so $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing and therefore injective on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$. [step 1.3, L2]

2.3 Multiplicative identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m \cdot 1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(1 \cdot 1_F)$, and the step $(m(n+1)) \cdot 1_F = (mn + m) \cdot 1_F = (mn) \cdot 1_F + m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F) + (m \cdot 1_F)(1_F) = (m \cdot 1_F)((n+1) \cdot 1_F)$ uses 1.4 and distributivity. [step 1.4, algebra]

3.1 By induction on 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for every $n \ge 1$; with the strict increase 2.2 and the identities 1.4, 2.3, every claim holds. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 1.4, step 2.3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b, c \in F$.

1. If $a > 0$ and $b > 0$ then $ab > 0$.
2. If $a > 0$ and $b < 0$ then $ab < 0$.
3. If $a < 0$ and $b < 0$ then $ab > 0$.
4. If $c > 0$ then $a < b \iff ac < bc$.
5. If $c < 0$ then $a < b \iff bc < ac$ (multiplication by a negative reverses order).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b, c \in F$.

[L1] For $x, y \in F$: $x < y \iff y - x \in P$; $x > 0 \iff x \in P$; $x < 0 \iff -x \in P$; and (trichotomy) for each $x$ exactly one of $x \in P$, $x = 0$, $-x \in P$ holds, so $0 \notin P$ and $x \in P \Rightarrow x \neq 0$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] $P$ is closed under multiplication: if $u, v \in P$ then $uv \in P$ (axiom O2 of [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] In any field, $(-u)v = -(uv)$ and $(-u)(-v) = uv$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] In any field, $0 \cdot u = 0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a > 0$ and $b > 0$, i.e. $a \in P$ and $b \in P$; closure gives $ab \in P$, so $ab > 0$, proving claim 1. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.2 Assume $a > 0$ and $b < 0$, i.e. $a \in P$ and $-b \in P$; closure gives $a(-b) \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.3 Assume $a < 0$ and $b < 0$, i.e. $-a \in P$ and $-b \in P$; closure gives $(-a)(-b) \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.4 Assume $c > 0$ and $a < b$, i.e. $c \in P$ and $b - a \in P$; closure gives $(b - a)c \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.5 Assume $c < 0$ and $a < b$, i.e. $-c \in P$ and $b - a \in P$; closure gives $(b - a)(-c) \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

2.1 Since $a(-b) = -(ab)$ by L3, step 1.2 gives $-(ab) \in P$, so $ab < 0$, proving claim 2. [step 1.2, L3, L1]

2.2 Since $(-a)(-b) = ab$ by L3, step 1.3 gives $ab \in P$, so $ab > 0$, proving claim 3. [step 1.3, L3, L1]

2.3 By distributivity $(b - a)c = bc - ac$, so step 1.4 gives $bc - ac \in P$, i.e. $ac < bc$: this is the forward direction of claim 4. [step 1.4, algebra, L1]

2.4 By L3 and distributivity $(b - a)(-c) = -((b - a)c) = -(bc - ac) = ac - bc$, so step 1.5 gives $ac - bc \in P$, i.e. $bc < ac$: this is the forward direction of claim 5. [step 1.5, L3, algebra, L1]

3.1 Conversely, assume $c > 0$ and $ac < bc$; by trichotomy exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds. If $a = b$ then $ac = bc$, contradicting $ac < bc$; if $b < a$ then the argument of step 2.3 applied to the pair $b < a$ gives $bc < ac$, so $bc - ac \in P$ (from $ac < bc$) while $ac - bc \in P$ (from $bc < ac$), putting the element $bc - ac$ and its negative $ac - bc$ both in $P$, which trichotomy forbids; hence $a < b$: this completes claim 4. [assume-hyp, step 2.3, L4, L1, algebra]

4.1 Conversely, assume $c < 0$ and $bc < ac$; by trichotomy exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds. If $a = b$ then $ac = bc$, contradicting $bc < ac$; if $b < a$ then the argument of step 2.4 applied to the pair $b < a$ gives $ac < bc$, so $ac - bc \in P$ (from $bc < ac$) while $bc - ac \in P$ (from $ac < bc$), putting the element $ac - bc$ and its negative $bc - ac$ both in $P$, which trichotomy forbids; hence $a < b$: this completes claim 5.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let
$\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\varepsilon > 0$. Put

$$E_\varepsilon \;:=\; \{\, x \in A : \omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon \,\}$$

([[def-oscillation]]). Then there is a **closed** $G \subseteq \mathbb{R}$
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) with

$$E_\varepsilon \;=\; A \cap G .$$

In particular, if $A = \mathbb{R}$ then $E_\varepsilon$ is itself a closed
subset of $\mathbb{R}$.

**The set $G$ is produced explicitly and does not depend on any choice**: it is
the complement of

$$U \;:=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : \omega_f(A \cap N_\rho(y)) < \varepsilon \ \text{ for some real } \rho > 0 \,\},$$

which the proof shows to be open. Note that $y$ ranges over all of $\mathbb{R}$
here and not only over $A$; the expression $\omega_f(A \cap N_\rho(y))$ is the
oscillation of $f$ on a subset of $A$ and makes sense for every real $y$, taking
the value $\sup \varnothing = -\infty$ when $A \cap N_\rho(y) = \varnothing$
([[def-oscillation]], [[lem-extended-reals-complete]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$, and a real $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] $\omega_f(S) = \sup\{|f(x) - f(y)| : x, y \in S\}$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, and $\omega_f(S) \le \omega_f(T)$ whenever $S \subseteq T \subseteq A$; for $c \in A$, $\omega_f(c) = \inf\{\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c)) : \delta > 0\}$ ([[def-oscillation]], [[def-extended-reals]]).

[L2] In $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ every subset has a greatest lower bound; an infimum is $\ge$ an extended real $\ell$ exactly when $\ell$ bounds the set from below, and the infimum is $\le$ every member of the set ([[lem-extended-reals-complete]]).

[L3] $N_\delta(x) = \{y : |y - x| < \delta\}$; if $|y - x| < \rho/2$ then $N_{\rho/2}(y) \subseteq N_\rho(x)$, since $|z - y| < \rho/2$ gives $|z - x| \le |z - y| + |y - x| < \rho$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L4] $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is open when every point of $U$ has a neighbourhood contained in $U$, and $G \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is closed exactly when $\mathbb{R} \setminus G$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Define $U := \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : \omega_f(A \cap N_\rho(y)) < \varepsilon$ for some real $\rho > 0 \,\}$ and $G := \mathbb{R} \setminus U$. [construct]

2.1 $U$ is open. Let $y \in U$ with witness $\rho > 0$, and let $z \in N_{\rho/2}(y)$. Then $N_{\rho/2}(z) \subseteq N_\rho(y)$, hence $A \cap N_{\rho/2}(z) \subseteq A \cap N_\rho(y)$, hence $\omega_f(A \cap N_{\rho/2}(z)) \le \omega_f(A \cap N_\rho(y)) < \varepsilon$, so $z \in U$ with witness $\rho/2$. Thus $N_{\rho/2}(y) \subseteq U$. [step 1.1, L1, L3, L4]

2.2 Let $x \in A$ with $x \notin U$. Then $\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(x)) \ge \varepsilon$ for every real $\delta > 0$, so $\varepsilon$ is a lower bound of the set whose infimum is $\omega_f(x)$, and therefore $\omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon$, that is $x \in E_\varepsilon$. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.3 Let $x \in E_\varepsilon$, so $x \in A$ and $\omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon$. For every real $\delta > 0$ the value $\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(x))$ is at least the infimum $\omega_f(x)$, hence at least $\varepsilon$; so no $\rho$ witnesses membership of $x$ in $U$, that is $x \notin U$. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

3.1 $G$ is closed, being the complement of the open set $U$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L4]

4.1 Steps 2.2 and 2.3 together say that for $x \in A$ one has $x \in E_\varepsilon$ if and only if $x \in G$; hence $E_\varepsilon = A \cap G$ with $G$ closed. [step 3.1, step 2.2, step 2.3]

5.1 If $A = \mathbb{R}$ then $E_\varepsilon = \mathbb{R} \cap G = G$ is closed in $\mathbb{R}$. [step 4.1, L4] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the strict inequality is on the open side.** The set $U$ is defined by a
  strict inequality and an existential quantifier over $\rho$, which is what
  makes it open; its complement is then closed, and the superlevel set
  $\{\omega_f \ge \varepsilon\}$ is what remains of it inside $A$. Defining
  $E_\varepsilon$ with a strict inequality instead, as
  $\{\omega_f > \varepsilon\}$, would not give a closed set in general, and the
  exhaustion of [[thm-discontinuity-set-is-f-sigma]] is arranged so that only the
  non-strict form is ever needed.

- **The relative form is the honest one.** For general $A$ the set
  $E_\varepsilon$ is a subset of $A$ and there is no reason for it to be closed
  in $\mathbb{R}$: taking $A = (0,1)$ and $f$ the restriction of a function with
  oscillation $\ge \varepsilon$ everywhere gives $E_\varepsilon = (0,1)$, which
  is not closed. What is always true is the displayed identity
  $E_\varepsilon = A \cap G$, and that is what the theorems downstream use.

## Statement

Let $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be compact ([[def-open-cover-r]]), equivalently
closed and bounded ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]]). Then

$$K \text{ has measure zero} \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad K \text{ has content zero}$$

([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

The implication from content zero to measure zero is
[[lem-content-zero-implies-null]] and needs no hypothesis on $K$. The other
direction is the one that uses compactness, and it uses it exactly as
[[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]] does: a countable cover is enlarged to
an open cover at an arbitrarily small cost in total length, and compactness
reduces the open cover to a finite one.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A compact set $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a real $\varepsilon > 0$. Throughout, $\theta := 2^{-1}$.

[L1] $A$ is null when for every real $\eta > 0$ there are sequences $(a_k)$, $(b_k)$ with $a_k \le b_k$, $A \subseteq \bigcup_k[a_k,b_k]$ and $\sum_{k<i}(b_k - a_k) \le \eta$ for every $i$; $A$ has content zero when the same holds with a finite list ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

[L2] A set of content zero is null ([[lem-content-zero-implies-null]]).

[L3] $[c,d]$ has length $d - c \ge 0$ for $c \le d$; $(c,d)$ is the open interval with the same endpoints and is contained in $[c,d]$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L4] Every open interval is an open set ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L5] $K$ is compact: from every family of open sets whose union contains $K$, either $K = \varnothing$ and the empty subfamily covers it, or there are $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and members $U_0, \dots, U_m$ of the family whose union contains $K$; compactness is equivalent to being closed and bounded ([[def-open-cover-r]], [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]]).

[L6] Powers and the geometric series: $\theta^0 = 1$, $\theta^{k+1} = \theta^k\theta$, $\theta^k > 0$, and $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\theta^k = 2$ for $\theta = 2^{-1}$; a series of nonnegative terms has all its partial sums at most its sum ([[def-integer-power]], [[thm-geometric-series]], [[def-series]], [[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]]).

[L7] Finite sums: additivity, scaling, splitting and monotonicity in the terms ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L8] Every finite list of naturals has an upper bound in $\mathbb{N}$, by induction on its length and the totality of the order of $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]], [[lem-nat-trichotomy]], [[def-nat-order]]).

[L9] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 > 0$, $4 > 0$, $8 > 0$ and $t \cdot 8^{-1} > 0$ for $t > 0$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve an inequality ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 One direction is immediate: if $K$ has content zero then $K$ is null by [L2], with no hypothesis on $K$ used. It remains to prove the converse for compact $K$. [L2, suffices: only the forward direction remains]

1.2 If $K = \varnothing$, then for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the single interval $[0,0]$ covers $K$ and has total length $0 \le \varepsilon$, so $K$ has content zero by [L1]. Hence suppose $K \ne \varnothing$ for the rest of the proof. [L1, cases]

2.1 Assume $K$ is null and let the real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. By [L1] applied with $\eta := \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} > 0$ fix sequences $(a_k)$, $(b_k)$ with $a_k \le b_k$, $K \subseteq \bigcup_k [a_k,b_k]$ and $\sum_{k<i}(b_k - a_k) \le \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$ for every $i \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 1.1, given, L1, L9, choose]

3.1 Put $\delta_k := \varepsilon \cdot 8^{-1} \cdot \theta^{k}$, a positive real by [L6] and [L9], and $J_k := (a_k - \delta_k,\ b_k + \delta_k)$, an open set by [L4] containing $[a_k,b_k]$ by [L3] and [L9]. Hence $\{\, J_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\}$ is a family of open sets whose union contains $K$, and the closed interval $[a_k - \delta_k,\ b_k + \delta_k]$ has length $(b_k - a_k) + 2\delta_k = (b_k - a_k) + \varepsilon \cdot 4^{-1} \cdot \theta^{k}$ by [L3] and [L9]. [step 2.1, L3, L4, L6, L9]

4.1 By [L5] there are $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and members $J_{k_0}, \dots, J_{k_m}$ of that family covering $K$, and by [L8] there is $N \in \mathbb{N}$ with $k_t \le N$ for every $t \le m$; then $K \subseteq \bigcup_{k \le N} J_k \subseteq \bigcup_{k \le N}[a_k - \delta_k,\ b_k + \delta_k]$ by [L3]. [step 1.2, step 3.1, L3, L5, L8, choose]

5.1 The total length of that finite list is $\sum_{k \le N}\big((b_k - a_k) + \varepsilon \cdot 4^{-1}\theta^{k}\big) = \sum_{k<N+1}(b_k - a_k) + \varepsilon \cdot 4^{-1}\sum_{k<N+1}\theta^{k} \le \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} + \varepsilon \cdot 4^{-1} \cdot 2 = \varepsilon$, by [L7], step 2.1, [L6] and [L9]. [step 2.1, step 3.1, step 4.1, L6, L7, L9]

6.1 So for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the finite list of step 4.1 covers $K$ with total length at most $\varepsilon$, which by [L1] is exactly the statement that $K$ has content zero; together with step 1.1 the two notions coincide on compact sets. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 4.1, step 5.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Compactness, not boundedness, is what does the work.** $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$ is bounded and null and does not have content zero ([[cex-null-set-not-of-content-zero]]); it fails to be closed, and the finite subcover step is exactly what it cannot supply.

- **The theorem is what makes content zero usable at all.** Every set to which content zero is applied on this page is compact: the Cantor set ([[thm-cantor-set-properties]]) and the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set ([[def-fat-cantor-set]]) are both closed and bounded, so for them the two notions may be used interchangeably, and the finite form is the one that combines with [[lem-finite-interval-cover-total-length]].

- **The cost of opening up the cover is $\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$, chosen in advance.** Splitting the budget in half before the enlargement, rather than after, is what keeps the final total at $\varepsilon$ exactly; the same bookkeeping appears in [[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]] and in [[thm-countable-union-of-null-is-null]].

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Then

$$f \text{ is continuous at } c \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \omega_f(c) = 0$$

([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-oscillation]]).

Since $\omega_f(c) \ge 0$ always ([[def-oscillation]]), the equivalent form of
the right-hand side is: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ with $\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c)) < \varepsilon$.

**This is the tool that converts a pointwise condition into a set condition.**
Continuity at $c$ is a statement about $f$ near $c$ with a quantifier over
$\varepsilon$; $\omega_f(c) = 0$ is the vanishing of a single extended real
attached to the point. The change of form is what makes the discontinuity set
accessible: the sets $\{\,x : \omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon\,\}$ are closed
([[lem-oscillation-superlevel-sets-are-closed]]) and their union over
$\varepsilon = 1, 1/2, 1/3, \dots$ is the discontinuity set
([[thm-discontinuity-set-is-f-sigma]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$, and a point $c \in A$.

[L1] $f$ is continuous at $c$ exactly when for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ with $|f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ for every $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$; equivalently for every $x \in A \cap N_\delta(c)$ ([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L2] $\omega_f(S) = \sup\{|f(x) - f(y)| : x, y \in S\}$ and $\omega_f(c) = \inf\{\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c)) : \delta > 0\}$, both in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$; $0 \le \omega_f(c) \le \omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c))$ for every real $\delta > 0$, and $c \in A \cap N_\delta(c)$ ([[def-oscillation]], [[def-extended-reals]]).

[L3] In $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ every subset has a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound; a supremum is at most an extended real $u$ exactly when $u$ bounds every member of the set, and an infimum is at least an extended real $\ell$ exactly when $\ell$ bounds every member from below ([[lem-extended-reals-complete]]).

[L4] $|u - w| \le |u - v| + |v - w|$ and $|u| \ge 0$ for reals $u, v, w$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Suppose $f$ is continuous at $c$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real. Take $\delta > 0$ with $|f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon/2$ for every $x \in A \cap N_\delta(c)$. [L1]

1.2 Conversely, suppose $\omega_f(c) = 0$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real. Not every member of $\{\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c)) : \delta > 0\}$ can be $\ge \varepsilon$, for then $\varepsilon$ would be a lower bound of that set and the infimum $\omega_f(c) = 0$ would satisfy $0 \ge \varepsilon$. So there is a real $\delta > 0$ with $\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c)) < \varepsilon$. [L2, L3]

2.1 For $x, y \in A \cap N_\delta(c)$ with $\delta$ as in step 1.1, $|f(x) - f(y)| \le |f(x) - f(c)| + |f(c) - f(y)| < \varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$; so $\varepsilon$ is an upper bound of the set whose supremum is $\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c))$, and therefore $\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c)) \le \varepsilon$. [step 1.1, L2, L3, L4]

2.2 With $\delta$ as in step 1.2 and any $x \in A \cap N_\delta(c)$: both $x$ and $c$ lie in $A \cap N_\delta(c)$, so $|f(x) - f(c)|$ is one of the values whose supremum is $\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c))$ and therefore $|f(x) - f(c)| \le \omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c)) < \varepsilon$. [step 1.2, L2, L3]

3.1 Hence $0 \le \omega_f(c) \le \varepsilon$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$. If $\omega_f(c)$ were not $0$ it would satisfy $0 < \omega_f(c) \le 1$, hence be a positive real, and taking $\varepsilon := \omega_f(c)/2$ would give $\omega_f(c) \le \omega_f(c)/2$, which is false for a positive real. So $\omega_f(c) = 0$. [step 2.1, L2, L3]

4.1 Since $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary in step 1.2, the continuity condition holds at $c$, and $f$ is continuous at $c$. Together with step 3.1 this proves the equivalence. [step 3.1, step 2.2, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the extended reals are used, and where they are not.** The definition
  of $\omega_f$ needs them, because $f$ may be unbounded near $c$ and the
  supremum may then be $+\infty$; the proof needs only the order relations, and
  the two directions never compare an infinite value with a real except through
  the inequality $0 \le \omega_f(c) \le \varepsilon$, which already forces
  $\omega_f(c)$ to be real.

- **The oscillation measures how badly continuity fails, not merely whether it
  does.** The theorem uses only whether $\omega_f(c)$ vanishes, but the number
  itself carries more: the oscillation of Thomae's function at a point $c$ is
  proved below to be exactly $t(c)$
  ([[thm-dirichlet-and-thomae-continuity-sets]]), so it is $1/q$ at a rational
  with least denominator $q$ and $0$ at every irrational.

## Statement

**Assume the Axiom of Countable Choice** ([[def-countable-choice]]). Let
$(A_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, each of
measure zero ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]). Then

$$\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n \quad \text{has measure zero.}$$

By the padding convention of [[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]] and
[[def-countable]] the same conclusion covers the union of an at most countable
family of null sets, a finite family being extended by copies of $\varnothing$.

**The hypothesis $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ is spent at exactly one step, step 2.1
below**, where one covering sequence is selected for every $A_n$ at once. Each
$A_n$ has many such covers and nullity provides no rule for singling one out.
Nothing else in the proof selects anything: the diagonal enumeration and the
estimate are formulas.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(A_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of null subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ and a real $\varepsilon > 0$. Throughout, $\theta := 2^{-1}$.

[A1] The Axiom of Countable Choice: every family $(X_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of nonempty sets has a function $f$ on $\mathbb{N}$ with $f(n) \in X_n$ for every $n$ ([[def-countable-choice]]).

[L1] $A$ is null when for every real $\eta > 0$ there are sequences $(a_k)$, $(b_k)$ with $a_k \le b_k$, $A \subseteq \bigcup_k[a_k,b_k]$ and $\sum_{k<n}(b_k - a_k) \le \eta$ for every $n$ ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

[L2] There is a bijection $J : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$, with inverse $J^{-1}$ ([[thm-n-cross-n-countable]], [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L3] Powers and the geometric series: $\theta^0 = 1$, $\theta^{m+1} = \theta^m \theta$, $\theta^m > 0$, and $\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\theta^m = 2$ for $\theta = 2^{-1}$; a series of nonnegative terms has all its partial sums at most its sum ([[def-integer-power]], [[thm-geometric-series]], [[def-series]], [[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]]).

[L4] Finite sums: additivity, scaling, splitting and monotonicity in the terms; a sum of nonnegative terms is nonnegative and does not decrease when further nonnegative terms are adjoined, so a sum of finitely many nonnegative terms indexed injectively inside a finite rectangle is at most the sum over the whole rectangle ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L5] Every finite list of naturals has an upper bound in $\mathbb{N}$, by induction on its length and the totality of the order of $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]], [[lem-nat-trichotomy]], [[def-nat-order]]).

[L6] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 > 0$ and $t \cdot 2^{-1} > 0$ for $t > 0$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve an inequality ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let the real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given and put $\varepsilon_n := \varepsilon \cdot \theta^{n+1}$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, a positive real by [L3] and [L6]. Let $X_n$ be the set of all pairs of sequences $\big((a_k),(b_k)\big)$ with $a_k \le b_k$ for every $k$, $A_n \subseteq \bigcup_k [a_k,b_k]$ and $\sum_{k<i}(b_k - a_k) \le \varepsilon_n$ for every $i \in \mathbb{N}$. Each $A_n$ is null, so each $X_n$ is nonempty by [L1]. [given, L1, L3, L6]

2.1 By [A1] fix $f$ with $f(n) \in X_n$ for every $n$, and write $f(n) = \big((a^n_k)_k, (b^n_k)_k\big)$. This is the one and only application of countable choice in the proof. [step 1.1, A1, choose]

3.1 By [L2] fix a bijection $J : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ and define sequences $(c_j)$ and $(d_j)$ by $c_{J(m,k)} := a^m_k$ and $d_{J(m,k)} := b^m_k$, which is a total definition because $J$ is a bijection; then $c_j \le d_j$ for every $j$. Every $x \in \bigcup_n A_n$ lies in some $A_m$, hence in some $[a^m_k, b^m_k] = [c_{J(m,k)}, d_{J(m,k)}]$ by step 2.1, so $\bigcup_n A_n \subseteq \bigcup_j [c_j, d_j]$. [step 2.1, L2]

4.1 Fix $i \in \mathbb{N}$. The pairs $J^{-1}(j)$ for $j < i$ are finitely many and pairwise distinct, so by [L5] there is $N \in \mathbb{N}$ with both coordinates of each of them at most $N$; since all the terms $d_j - c_j$ are nonnegative, [L4] gives $\sum_{j<i}(d_j - c_j) \le \sum_{m \le N}\Big(\sum_{k \le N}(b^m_k - a^m_k)\Big)$. For each $m \le N$ the inner sum is $\sum_{k < N+1}(b^m_k - a^m_k) \le \varepsilon_m$ by step 2.1, so the whole is at most $\sum_{m \le N} \varepsilon \cdot \theta^{m+1} = \varepsilon \cdot \theta \sum_{m<N+1}\theta^{m} \le \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} \cdot 2 = \varepsilon$, by [L3], [L4] and [L6]. [step 3.1, L3, L4, L5, L6]

5.1 Steps 3.1 and 4.1 exhibit, for the given $\varepsilon > 0$, sequences of closed intervals covering $\bigcup_n A_n$ with every partial total length at most $\varepsilon$; since $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary, [L1] gives that $\bigcup_n A_n$ has measure zero. [step 1.1, step 3.1, step 4.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the slack is geometric.** The $n$-th set is covered to within
  $\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-n-1}$ and the budgets sum to $\varepsilon$, exactly as in
  [[lem-countable-sets-are-null]], of which this theorem is the abstract form:
  applying it to the singletons $\{x_n\}$ of a listing recovers that lemma, at
  the cost of an appeal to $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ that the direct proof avoids.
  The expenditure is the same one, and made for the same reason, as in
  [[thm-countable-union-of-countable]].

- **No rearrangement theorem is used, and none is available here.** The estimate
  is made on finite partial sums only, and every finite partial sum of the
  doubly-indexed family is compared with a sum over a finite rectangle, which is a
  finite rearrangement. The theory of rearranging infinite series is not in the
  reading order at this point, and the proof is arranged so as not to need it.

- **The bound is on the total length, not on the number of intervals.** The
  combined cover is countable even when each $A_n$ is covered by infinitely many
  intervals, which is exactly what [[thm-n-cross-n-countable]] supplies. Nothing
  analogous holds for content zero: a countable union of sets of content zero
  need not have content zero, since $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$ is such a union
  ([[cex-null-set-not-of-content-zero]]).

- **This is where the two smallness notions of the page separate cleanly.** A
  countable union of null sets is null, whereas a countable union of nowhere
  dense sets is meager and, by [[thm-baire-category-r]], never all of
  $\mathbb{R}$; and yet $\mathbb{R}$ is the union of a meager set and a null set
  ([[cex-meager-set-of-full-measure]]).

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$. Write

$$D \;:=\; \{\, x \in A : f \text{ is discontinuous at } x \,\}, \qquad C \;:=\; A \setminus D$$

([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-classification-of-discontinuities]]). Then:

1. **Pointwise exhaustion.** $D = \{\, x \in A : \omega_f(x) > 0 \,\}$
   ([[def-oscillation]]), and $D$ is the union of the increasing sequence of
   superlevel sets
   $$D \;=\; \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \{\, x \in A : \omega_f(x) \ge 1/\iota(n+1) \,\}$$
   ([[def-canonical-natural]]), whose thresholds are $1, 1/2, 1/3, \dots$.
2. **Descriptive form.** There is an $F_\sigma$ set $F \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and
   a $G_\delta$ set $V \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-f-sigma-g-delta]]) with
   $$D \;=\; A \cap F, \qquad C \;=\; A \cap V, \qquad V = \mathbb{R} \setminus F ,$$
   and $F$ may be taken to be $\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} G_n$ with each $G_n$ a
   closed subset of $\mathbb{R}$ cutting down on $A$ to the $n$-th set of
   claim 1 ([[lem-oscillation-superlevel-sets-are-closed]]).

In particular, when $A = \mathbb{R}$ the discontinuity set $D$ is an $F_\sigma$
subset of $\mathbb{R}$ and the continuity set $C$ is a $G_\delta$ subset, and
claim 1 reads $D = \bigcup_{n} \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : \omega_f(x) \ge 1/\iota(n+1) \,\}$.

**Claim 1 is stated separately because it is what is cited downstream.** The
exhaustion of $D$ by the superlevel sets $\{\omega_f \ge 1/\iota(n+1)\}$ is used
directly wherever a property has to be established one threshold at a time —
[[thm-baire-one-continuity-points]] shows each superlevel set nowhere dense and
concludes that $D$ is meager — and that use needs the identity itself, not only
the descriptive conclusion of claim 2.

**The statement is relative on purpose.** For a general domain $A$ the sets $D$
and $C$ are subsets of $A$, and neither is $F_\sigma$ or $G_\delta$ in
$\mathbb{R}$ in general; what the proof produces are two subsets of $\mathbb{R}$
that cut down to them. The absolute form is stated only for $A = \mathbb{R}$,
which is the case [[thm-continuity-set-realisation]] and
[[cor-no-function-is-continuous-exactly-on-q]] use.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] $f$ is continuous at $c \in A$ if and only if $\omega_f(c) = 0$; and $\omega_f(c) \ge 0$ for every $c \in A$ ([[thm-continuity-iff-oscillation-zero]], [[def-oscillation]], [[def-extended-reals]]).

[L2] For every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a closed $G \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ with $\{x \in A : \omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon\} = A \cap G$ ([[lem-oscillation-superlevel-sets-are-closed]]).

[L3] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $m \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(m) < \eta$, where $\iota(m)$ is the canonical natural of $m$ in $\mathbb{R}$; and $\iota$ is strictly increasing and positive on the naturals $\ge 1$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L4] A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is $F_\sigma$ when it is the union of a sequence of closed sets and $G_\delta$ when it is the intersection of a sequence of open sets; $S$ is $F_\sigma$ if and only if $\mathbb{R} \setminus S$ is $G_\delta$ ([[def-f-sigma-g-delta]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ put $\varepsilon_n := 1/\iota(n+1)$, a positive real since $n + 1 \ge 1$, and let $G_n \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be closed with $\{x \in A : \omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon_n\} = A \cap G_n$. [L2, L3, construct]

1.2 $D = \{\, x \in A : \omega_f(x) > 0 \,\}$: a point $x \in A$ is a discontinuity exactly when $\omega_f(x) \ne 0$, and $\omega_f(x) \ge 0$ always, so exactly when $\omega_f(x) > 0$. [L1]

2.1 $D \subseteq \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} (A \cap G_n)$. Let $x \in D$, so $\omega_f(x) > 0$. If $\omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon_0 = 1$ then $x \in A \cap G_0$. Otherwise $0 < \omega_f(x) < 1$, so $\omega_f(x)$ is a positive real, and there is a natural $m \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(m) < \omega_f(x)$; writing $m = n + 1$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}$ gives $\omega_f(x) > \varepsilon_n$, hence $x \in A \cap G_n$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L3]

2.2 Conversely $\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} (A \cap G_n) \subseteq D$: if $x \in A \cap G_n$ then $\omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon_n > 0$, so $x \in D$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L3]

3.1 Put $F := \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} G_n$, an $F_\sigma$ subset of $\mathbb{R}$ since each $G_n$ is closed and the family is indexed by $\mathbb{N}$. Then $A \cap F = \bigcup_{n} (A \cap G_n) = D$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, L4]

3.2 Claim 1 is proved: $D = \{x \in A : \omega_f(x) > 0\}$ by step 1.2, and $D = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \{x \in A : \omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon_n\}$ by steps 2.1 and 2.2, since $A \cap G_n$ is by step 1.1 exactly the set $\{x \in A : \omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon_n\}$ with $\varepsilon_n = 1/\iota(n+1)$. The union is increasing, since $n \le m$ gives $\iota(n+1) \le \iota(m+1)$ and hence $\varepsilon_m \le \varepsilon_n$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.1, step 2.2, L3]

4.1 Put $V := \mathbb{R} \setminus F$, a $G_\delta$ subset of $\mathbb{R}$. Then $A \cap V = A \setminus (A \cap F) = A \setminus D = C$. [step 3.1, L4]

5.1 Claim 2 is proved by steps 3.1 and 4.1; and for $A = \mathbb{R}$ the two identities read $D = F$ and $C = V$, so $D$ is $F_\sigma$ and $C$ is $G_\delta$ outright. [step 3.1, step 3.2, step 4.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The exhaustion is indexed from $0$ and the thresholds are $1/\iota(n+1)$.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$, so the sequence of thresholds is $1, 1/2, 1/3, \dots$ and never $1/\iota(0)$, which is not defined. Writing the union as $\bigcup_{n \ge 1} \{\omega_f \ge 1/\iota(n)\}$ names the same family; the form above is used because a sequence in this library is a function on $\mathbb{N}$.

- **The converse holds and is proved separately.** Every $G_\delta$ subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is the continuity set of some function $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-continuity-set-realisation]]), so the two classes coincide exactly. What the present theorem contributes is the direction that constrains: no function can have a continuity set that fails to be $G_\delta$, and [[cor-no-function-is-continuous-exactly-on-q]] spends that on $\mathbb{Q}$.

## Statement

Let $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $K$ is compact ([[def-open-cover-r]]) if and
only if $K$ is closed ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) and bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]).

This is the Heine-Borel theorem in the form used everywhere below. The forward
implication is [[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]] and spends no
completeness, only the Archimedean property and the existence of maxima of
finite sets; the backward implication rests on
[[thm-heine-borel-r]] and therefore on the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$, and the
remarks below record where it fails without completeness.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] Open cover, finite subfamily and compactness; the empty subfamily covers $\varnothing$ ([[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L2] A compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is closed and bounded ([[lem-compact-implies-closed-and-bounded-r]]).

[L3] Every closed bounded interval $[\ell,u]$ with $\ell \le u$ is compact ([[thm-heine-borel-r]]).

[L4] $K$ is closed exactly when $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L5] $K$ is bounded exactly when there are $\ell, u \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\ell \le y \le u$ for every $y \in K$ ([[def-bounded-set]]).

[L6] $[\ell,u] = \{\, z \in \mathbb{R} : \ell \le z \le u \,\}$ ([[def-interval]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 If $K$ is compact then $K$ is closed and bounded, which is [L2]; this is the forward implication. [L2]

1.2 For the backward implication assume $K$ is closed and bounded. If $K = \varnothing$ then every open cover of $K$ admits the empty subfamily as a finite subcover, so $K$ is compact. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.3 Assume moreover $K \ne \varnothing$; fix $s \in K$ and, by [L5], reals $\ell, u$ with $\ell \le y \le u$ for every $y \in K$. Then $\ell \le s \le u$, so $\ell \le u$, and $K \subseteq [\ell,u]$ by [L6]. [assume-hyp, L5, L6, choose]

2.1 Let $\mathcal{U}$ be an open cover of $K$ and put $\mathcal{W} := \mathcal{U} \cup \{\mathbb{R} \setminus K\}$. Every member of $\mathcal{W}$ is open, since $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$ is open by [L4], and $\mathcal{W}$ covers $[\ell,u]$: a point of $[\ell,u]$ either lies in $K$, hence in some member of $\mathcal{U}$, or lies outside $K$, hence in $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$. [step 1.3, L1, L4]

3.1 By [L3] the interval $[\ell,u]$ is compact, so some finite subfamily $\{W_0, \dots, W_p\}$ of $\mathcal{W}$ covers $[\ell,u]$, where the case of an empty subfamily is possible only when $[\ell,u] = \varnothing$, which is excluded by $\ell \le u$. Put $\mathcal{V} := \{\, W_i : W_i \in \mathcal{U} \,\}$, a finite subfamily of $\mathcal{U}$. Then $K \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{V}$: a point $y \in K \subseteq [\ell,u]$ lies in some $W_i$, and $W_i$ cannot be a member of $\mathcal{W}$ outside $\mathcal{U}$, because the only such member is $\mathbb{R} \setminus K$ and $y \in K$; so $W_i \in \mathcal{U}$ and $W_i \in \mathcal{V}$. [step 2.1, L1, L3, L6]

4.1 Every open cover of a nonempty closed bounded $K$ therefore has a finite subcover, so such a $K$ is compact; together with the empty case of step 1.2 this proves the backward implication, and step 1.1 is the forward one. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 3.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **A closed subset of a compact set is compact.** If $C \subseteq K$ with $K$
  compact and $C$ closed, then $C$ is bounded, being a subset of a bounded set,
  and closed by hypothesis, so it is compact by the theorem. The corresponding
  statement for arbitrary subsets is false: $(0,1) \subseteq [0,1]$ is bounded
  and not compact ([[cex-unbounded-closed-set-not-compact]]).

- **Both hypotheses are needed and neither implies the other.**
  [[cex-unbounded-closed-set-not-compact]] exhibits a closed set that is not
  bounded and a bounded set that is not closed, and neither is compact.

- **What the theorem is not.** It characterises compactness *for subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$*. The two halves are of very different strengths: the forward
  half is elementary and general, while the backward half rests on the
  completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ and fails over $\mathbb{Q}$
  ([[fs-closed-bounded-compact-without-completeness]], witnessed by
  [[cex-closed-bounded-in-q-not-compact]]). Nothing here licenses "closed and
  bounded implies compact" in any other setting.

## Statement

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. If $0 \in S$ and $\sigma(n) \in S$ whenever $n \in S$, then $S = \mathbb{N}$. Equivalently (property form): if a property $P$ satisfies $P(0)$ and ($P(n) \Rightarrow P(\sigma(n))$) for all $n$, then $P(n)$ holds for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. This is the induction principle, the basis of proof by induction.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $\mathbb{N} = \omega$ is the smallest inductive set ([[def-inductive-set]], [[def-natural-numbers]], [[lem-omega-smallest-inductive]]); $0 = \varnothing$, $\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$.

[L1] $\omega$ is contained in every inductive set ([[lem-omega-smallest-inductive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Suppose $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ with $0 = \varnothing \in S$ and ($x \in S \Rightarrow \sigma(x) = x \cup \{x\} \in S$). [given]

2.1 Then $S$ contains $\varnothing$ and is closed under $x \mapsto x \cup \{x\}$, so $S$ is an inductive set. [step 1.1]

3.1 $\mathbb{N} = \omega \subseteq S$ because $\omega$ is a subset of every inductive set. [L1, step 2.1]

4.1 With $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ by hypothesis, $S = \mathbb{N}$. [step 3.1, given]

5.1 The property form is the set case with $S = \{n \in \mathbb{N} : P(n)\}$: $P(0)$ and $P(n) \Rightarrow P(\sigma(n))$ give $0 \in S$ and $\sigma$-closure, so $S = \mathbb{N}$, i.e. $P$ holds for all $n$; conversely the set form is the property form applied to $P(n) :\equiv n \in S$, so the two are equivalent.

## Statement

Every complete ordered field $F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) is Archimedean:
for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$,
where $n \cdot 1_F$ is the canonical natural of the ordered field $F$
([[def-ordered-field]]). Equivalently, the canonical naturals are cofinal in $F$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $F$; write $A = \{\, n \cdot 1_F : n \ge 1 \,\}$ for the set of its canonical naturals.

[L1] Least-upper-bound property: every nonempty $S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound $\sup S \in F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Each canonical natural satisfies $n \cdot 1_F > 0$, one has $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L3] $0 < 1_F$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $F$ is not Archimedean: there is some $x \in F$ with $n \cdot 1_F \le x$ for all $n \ge 1$, that is, $x$ is an upper bound of $A$. [assume-contra]

2.1 The set $A$ is nonempty, since $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F \in A$, and it is bounded above by $x$. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 By the least-upper-bound property, $A$ has a least upper bound $s = \sup A \in F$. [step 2.1, L1]

4.1 Since $1_F > 0$, we have $s - 1_F < s$; as $s$ is the least upper bound, $s - 1_F$ is not an upper bound of $A$. [step 3.1, L3]

5.1 Hence there is some $m \ge 1$ with $m \cdot 1_F > s - 1_F$. [step 4.1]

6.1 Adding $1_F$ to both sides, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F > s$. [step 5.1, L2]

7.1 But $(m+1) \cdot 1_F \in A$, so $(m+1) \cdot 1_F \le s$ because $s$ is an upper bound of $A$, contradicting 6.1. [step 6.1, step 3.1, L2]

8.1 The assumption is therefore untenable, so $F$ is Archimedean. [step 7.1, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Statement

Let open and closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ be as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

1. **Arbitrary unions of open sets are open.** If $\mathcal{U}$ is any family of
   open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, then $\bigcup \mathcal{U}$ is open.
2. **Finite intersections of open sets are open.** If $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
   $U_0, \dots, U_n$ are open, then $U_0 \cap \dots \cap U_n$ is open.
3. **Arbitrary intersections of closed sets are closed.** If $\mathcal{F}$ is a
   nonempty family of closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, then
   $\bigcap \mathcal{F}$ is closed.
4. **Finite unions of closed sets are closed.** If $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
   $F_0, \dots, F_n$ are closed, then $F_0 \cup \dots \cup F_n$ is closed.

The word *finite* in claims 2 and 4 is not decoration: an arbitrary
intersection of open sets need not be open, and dually an arbitrary union
of closed sets need not be closed; the remarks below say where that is settled.
Claim 3 asks $\mathcal{F}$ to be nonempty
only so that $\bigcap \mathcal{F}$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ without appeal to
a convention about the empty intersection.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A family $\mathcal{U}$ of open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, with $\bigcup \mathcal{U} = \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \in U \text{ for some } U \in \mathcal{U} \,\}$; a natural number $n$ and open sets $U_0, \dots, U_n$; a nonempty family $\mathcal{F}$ of closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, with $\bigcap \mathcal{F} = \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \in F \text{ for every } F \in \mathcal{F} \,\}$; and closed sets $F_0, \dots, F_n$.

[A1] De Morgan's laws in the ambient set theory: for a nonempty family $\mathcal{G}$ of subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{R} \setminus \bigcap \mathcal{G} = \bigcup \{\, \mathbb{R} \setminus G : G \in \mathcal{G} \,\}$, and $\mathbb{R} \setminus (G_0 \cup \dots \cup G_n) = (\mathbb{R} \setminus G_0) \cap \dots \cap (\mathbb{R} \setminus G_n)$. Also $\mathbb{R} \setminus (\mathbb{R} \setminus G) = G$.

[L1] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; $F$ is closed when $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L2] $N_\varepsilon(x) = \{\, y : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}$, and $0 < \delta \le \varepsilon$ gives $N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] Every nonempty finite set of reals has a minimum, so $\min\{\varepsilon, \eta\}$ is defined and equals one of the two entries, and is $\le$ both ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $x \in \bigcup \mathcal{U}$. Then $x \in U$ for some $U \in \mathcal{U}$, and $U$ is open, so there is $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{U}$; as $x$ was arbitrary, $\bigcup \mathcal{U}$ is open, which is claim 1. [given, L1, choose]

1.2 Now let $U$ and $V$ be open and let $x \in U \cap V$; fix $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$ and $\eta > 0$ with $N_\eta(x) \subseteq V$. [given, L1, choose]

2.1 Put $\delta := \min\{\varepsilon, \eta\}$, which is one of $\varepsilon, \eta$ and hence $> 0$, and satisfies $\delta \le \varepsilon$ and $\delta \le \eta$; then $N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$ and $N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\eta(x) \subseteq V$, so $N_\delta(x) \subseteq U \cap V$, and as $x$ was arbitrary $U \cap V$ is open. [step 1.2, L2, L3]

2.2 The family $\{\, \mathbb{R} \setminus F : F \in \mathcal{F} \,\}$ consists of open sets by [L1], so its union is open by step 1.1; that union is $\mathbb{R} \setminus \bigcap \mathcal{F}$ by [A1], so $\bigcap \mathcal{F}$ is closed, which is claim 3. [step 1.1, A1, L1]

3.1 Claim 2 now follows by induction on $n$: for $n = 0$ the intersection is $U_0$, which is open by hypothesis; and if $W := U_0 \cap \dots \cap U_n$ is open then $U_0 \cap \dots \cap U_{n+1} = W \cap U_{n+1}$ is an intersection of two open sets, hence open by step 2.1. [step 2.1, given]

4.1 Each $\mathbb{R} \setminus F_i$ is open by [L1], so $(\mathbb{R} \setminus F_0) \cap \dots \cap (\mathbb{R} \setminus F_n)$ is open by step 3.1; that set is $\mathbb{R} \setminus (F_0 \cup \dots \cup F_n)$ by [A1], so $F_0 \cup \dots \cup F_n$ is closed, which is claim 4. [step 3.1, A1, L1]

5.1 Claims 1, 2, 3 and 4 are steps 1.1, 3.1, 2.2 and 4.1 respectively, so arbitrary unions and finite intersections of open sets are open, and arbitrary intersections and finite unions of closed sets are closed. [step 1.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, step 4.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Completeness plays no part.** Nothing above uses the least-upper-bound
  property, or even the Archimedean property: the only facts about $\mathbb{R}$
  the proof touches are the definition of a neighbourhood, its monotonicity in
  the radius, and the comparison of two positive radii. What needs completeness
  is not the algebra of open sets but the theorems about compactness that come
  later.

- **Why finiteness cannot be dropped in claim 2.** The minimum taken in step 2.1
  is a minimum of finitely many positive radii, and it is positive precisely
  because it is one of them ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]). An infinite family of
  positive radii has an infimum that may be $0$, and then no positive $\delta$
  survives. That is exactly what happens for the shrinking intervals of
  [[fs-arbitrary-intersection-of-open-is-open]], whose named witness is
  [[cex-intersection-of-shrinking-intervals-not-open]].

- **The four claims are a rewriting of two.** Claims 3 and 4 are claims 1 and 2
  read through complementation, and closedness is *defined* by complementation
  ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), so no separate argument about closed sets is
  possible or needed.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]). Then $f$ is Darboux integrable on $[a,b]$
([[def-darboux-integral]]) **if and only if**

$$\text{for every real } \varepsilon > 0 \text{ there is a partition } P \text{ of } [a,b] \text{ with } U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$$

([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

**This is the criterion every later integrability proof on this page uses.** It
replaces a statement about a supremum and an infimum over all partitions, which
cannot be checked directly, by the exhibition of a **single** partition for each
$\varepsilon$. The criterion says nothing about the value of the integral; that
is located separately, by [[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]], between $L(f,P)$
and $U(f,P)$ for the same $P$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and a bounded $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$.

[A1] The criterion: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a partition $P$ of $[a,b]$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$.

[L1] $L(f,P) \le \underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,P)$ for every partition $P$; $\underline{\int_a^b} f = \sup \mathcal{L}$ and $\overline{\int_a^b} f = \inf \mathcal{U}$ over the nonempty sets $\mathcal{L}$ of lower sums and $\mathcal{U}$ of upper sums; $f$ is integrable exactly when the two are equal ([[def-darboux-integral]], [[def-darboux-sums]]).

[L2] $\varepsilon$-characterisation of the supremum: if $u = \sup S$ with $S$ nonempty then for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $s \in S$ with $s > u - \varepsilon$ ([[lem-sup-epsilon]]). Dually, if $\ell = \inf S$ then for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $s \in S$ with $s < \ell + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-inf-epsilon]], [[def-infimum]]).

[L3] If $P'$ refines $P$ then $L(f,P) \le L(f,P')$ and $U(f,P') \le U(f,P)$; the common refinement $P_1 \vee P_2$ refines both $P_1$ and $P_2$ ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]], [[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L4] Ordered-field arithmetic: adding a constant to both sides preserves an inequality, the order is total and transitive, and $t \cdot 2^{-1} > 0$ for $t > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Write $D := \overline{\int_a^b} f - \underline{\int_a^b} f$, a real number with $D \ge 0$ by [L1]; $f$ is integrable exactly when $D = 0$. [L1]

1.2 **The criterion is sufficient.** Assume [A1] and let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. Fix a partition $P$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$. By [L1], $\underline{\int_a^b} f \ge L(f,P)$ and $\overline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,P)$, so $D \le U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon$. [A1, L1, L4, choose]

1.3 **The criterion is necessary; this half of the proof is steps 1.3, 2.2 and 3.1, and its symbols are its own.** Assume $f$ is integrable and write $I$ for the common value $\underline{\int_a^b} f = \overline{\int_a^b} f$. Let a real $\eta > 0$ be given; then $\eta \cdot 2^{-1} > 0$ by [L4]. [L1, L4]

2.1 So $0 \le D < \varepsilon$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$. If $D > 0$, taking $\varepsilon := D$ gives $D < D$, which is false; hence $D = 0$ and $f$ is integrable by step 1.1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L4]

2.2 By [L2] applied to $\mathcal{L}$, whose supremum is $I$, there is a partition $P_1$ with $L(f,P_1) > I - \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$; by [L2] applied to $\mathcal{U}$, whose infimum is $I$, there is a partition $P_2$ with $U(f,P_2) < I + \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$. [step 1.3, L1, L2, choose]

3.1 Put $P_{\ast} := P_1 \vee P_2$, which refines both by [L3]. Then $L(f,P_{\ast}) \ge L(f,P_1) > I - \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$ and $U(f,P_{\ast}) \le U(f,P_2) < I + \eta \cdot 2^{-1}$, so $U(f,P_{\ast}) - L(f,P_{\ast}) < \eta$ by [L4]. Since $\eta > 0$ was arbitrary, the criterion holds. [step 2.2, L3, L4]

4.1 Steps 1.2 and 2.1 give the implication from the criterion to integrability, and steps 1.3, 2.2 and 3.1 give the converse; the two halves are independent and use no symbol in common, and together they are the stated equivalence. [step 2.1, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The strict inequality is not essential.** Requiring $U(f,P) - L(f,P) \le \varepsilon$ for every $\varepsilon > 0$ defines the same condition, since a partition working for $\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$ works strictly for $\varepsilon$. Statements below use whichever form is convenient and no consequence turns on the difference.

- **The common refinement is where the two partitions are reconciled.** Step 2.2 produces one partition good for the lower sum and another good for the upper sum, and there is no reason for them to be the same. [[lem-refinement-inequalities]] is exactly what allows a single partition to inherit both properties, and it is the only place in this proof where anything beyond the definitions is used.

- **No choice principle is used.** Steps 1.2, 2.2 and 3.1 instantiate finitely many existential statements, which is ordinary first-order reasoning. See [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].

## Statement

Every nonempty subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ has a least element: there is $\ell \in S$ with $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A nonempty subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. Define $T = \{\, n \in \mathbb{N} : \text{every } m \text{ with } m \le n \text{ satisfies } m \notin S \,\}$ (informally, no element of $S$ is $\le n$).

[L1] Induction principle: a subset of $\mathbb{N}$ that contains $0$ and is closed under $\sigma$ equals $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L2] $m < n \iff \sigma(m) \le n$; consequently no $k$ satisfies $n < k < \sigma(n)$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]).

[L3] Exactly one of $s < n$, $s = n$, $n < s$ holds ([[lem-nat-trichotomy]]); and $n < s \iff \sigma(n) \le s$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]).

[L4] $\sigma$ is injective (Peano axiom P2) ([[thm-omega-is-peano-system]]).

[L5] $\sigma(a) + i = \sigma(a + i)$ for all $a, i$ (the left successor law, [[lem-nat-add-successor-left]]).

[L6] $0 + k = k$ for all $k$ ([[lem-nat-add-identity]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose $S$ is nonempty but has no least element. [assume-contra]

1.2 If $m < \sigma(n)$ then $m \le n$: by [L2] applied to $m$ and $\sigma(n)$ we get $\sigma(m) \le \sigma(n)$, say $\sigma(m) + i = \sigma(n)$; then $\sigma(m + i) = \sigma(m) + i = \sigma(n)$ [L5], so $m + i = n$ by injectivity [L4], hence $m \le n$. [L2, L4, L5]

2.1 First, $0 \in T$: if $0 \in S$ then $0 \le s$ for all $s \in S$, since $0 + s = s$ [L6], making $0$ a least element, contrary to the assumption; hence $0 \notin S$; moreover $m \le 0$ forces $m = 0$, because $m \ne 0$ would give $0 < m$ (as $0 + m = m$ [L6] with $m \ne 0$) while $m \le 0$ gives $m < 0$, and [L3] admits at most one of these; so every $m \le 0$ lies outside $S$. [step 1.1, L3, L6, given]

2.2 Next, $T$ is closed under $\sigma$: assume $n \in T$; if $\sigma(n) \in S$ then no $s \in S$ satisfies $s < \sigma(n)$ (else $s \le n$ by step 1.2, so $s \notin S$ because $n \in T$, a contradiction), hence $\sigma(n) \le s$ for all $s \in S$ by [L3], making $\sigma(n)$ a least element, contrary to the assumption; therefore $\sigma(n) \notin S$, and any $m$ with $m \le \sigma(n)$ satisfies $m = \sigma(n)$ or $m \ne \sigma(n)$; in the second case $m \le \sigma(n)$ together with $m \ne \sigma(n)$ gives $m < \sigma(n)$ by the definition of the strict order, hence $m \le n$ by step 1.2 and $m \notin S$ because $n \in T$, while in the first case $m = \sigma(n) \notin S$; so every $m \le \sigma(n)$ lies outside $S$, giving $\sigma(n) \in T$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L3]

3.1 By the induction principle [L1], from $0 \in T$ and closure under $\sigma$, $T = \mathbb{N}$; then for every $n$, taking $m = n \le n$ shows $n \notin S$, so $S = \varnothing$, contradicting nonemptiness; therefore $S$ has a least element. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L1, discharge-contradiction] ∎
