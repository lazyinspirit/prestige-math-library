## Statement refuted

**Refuted:** that a nonnegative Riemann integrable function on $[a,b]$ with
$\int_a^b f = 0$ vanishes identically
([[fs-nonnegative-integrable-with-zero-integral-vanishes]],
[[def-darboux-integral]]).

The witness is Thomae's function $t$ on $[0,1]$
([[def-dirichlet-and-thomae-functions]]). It satisfies $0 \le t \le 1$, it is
Riemann integrable with $\int_0^1 t = 0$
([[ex-thomae-is-riemann-integrable-with-integral-zero]]), and it is **positive at
every rational point of $[0,1]$** — a dense set, and an infinite one. So the
failure is not at a single stray point: the function is nonzero on a dense
subset of the interval and the integral still vanishes.

**The repaired statement asks for continuity.** With $f$ continuous the
conclusion is true, and the reason is exactly what fails here: a continuous
function positive at one point is positive on a whole subinterval, whereas $t$ is
positive only on a set that contains no interval
([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]). That repaired statement is not proved here,
since the additivity of the integral over subintervals is not available at this
point in the reading order.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Thomae's function $t : [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$, with $t(x) = 1/\iota(q(x))$ at a rational $x$ of least denominator $q(x) \ge 1$ and $t(x) = 0$ at an irrational $x$ ([[def-dirichlet-and-thomae-functions]], [[def-canonical-natural]]).

[A1] The refuted claim: a nonnegative Riemann integrable function on a closed bounded interval with distinct endpoints whose integral is $0$ vanishes identically.

[L1] $0 \le t(x) \le 1$ for every $x \in [0,1]$, and $t(x) = 1/\iota(q(x)) > 0$ at every rational $x$, since $\iota(q(x)) \ge 1 > 0$ ([[def-dirichlet-and-thomae-functions]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L2] $t$ is Riemann integrable on $[0,1]$ and $\int_0^1 t = 0$ ([[ex-thomae-is-riemann-integrable-with-integral-zero]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L3] $t$ is discontinuous at every rational point and continuous at every irrational point, so its discontinuity set in $[0,1]$ is $\mathbb{Q}\cap[0,1]$ ([[thm-dirichlet-and-thomae-continuity-sets]]).

[L4] $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$, so every nonempty open interval contains a rational ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]).

[L5] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 2^{-1} < 1$, so $2^{-1}$ lies in $[0,1]$ and is rational; the order is total and transitive ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-interval]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $t$ is nonnegative on $[0,1]$ by [L1], and it is Riemann integrable there with $\int_0^1 t = 0$ by [L2]; the interval $[0,1]$ has $0 < 1$ by [L5]. [given, L1, L2, L5]

1.2 $t$ does not vanish identically: $2^{-1}$ is a rational point of $[0,1]$ by [L5], so $t(2^{-1}) > 0$ by [L1]. [given, L1, L5]

2.1 The hypotheses of [A1] hold for $t$ on $[0,1]$ and its conclusion fails, so [A1] is refuted. [step 1.1, step 1.2, A1]

3.1 The failure is dense, not isolated: by [L4] every nonempty open subinterval of $[0,1]$ contains a rational, at which $t$ is positive by [L1]; so $\{\, x \in [0,1] : t(x) > 0 \,\}$ meets every subinterval of $[0,1]$ with distinct endpoints. It is also exactly the set of discontinuities of $t$, by [L3] and [L1]. [step 1.2, L1, L3, L4] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the integral measures, and what it does not.** $\int_0^1 t = 0$ says that the upper Darboux sums can be made arbitrarily small, not that $t$ is small anywhere in particular. The set where $t$ is positive is $\mathbb{Q}\cap[0,1]$, which is null ([[lem-countable-sets-are-null]]); by [[thm-lebesgue-criterion]] that is also exactly why $t$ is integrable at all.

- **Every upper Darboux sum is strictly positive.** Each subinterval contains a rational, so $M_i > 0$ for every $i$ and $U(t,P) > 0$ for every partition $P$; the upper integral is nevertheless $0$, an infimum of a set of positive numbers. Nothing is contradictory here, and it is the cleanest reminder that an infimum need not be attained.

- **The Dirichlet function is not available as a witness.** It is also nonnegative and nonzero on a dense set, but it is not integrable at all ([[cex-dirichlet-is-not-riemann-integrable]]), so it cannot satisfy the hypotheses of the refuted claim. Thomae's function is the standard witness precisely because it repairs integrability while keeping the dense positive set.

## Statement refuted

**Refuted:** that every bounded function on a closed bounded interval with
distinct endpoints is Riemann integrable
([[fs-bounded-implies-riemann-integrable]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

The witness is the Dirichlet function $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ restricted to
$[0,1]$ ([[def-dirichlet-and-thomae-functions]]). It takes only the values $0$
and $1$, so it is bounded ([[def-bounded-set]]); every lower Darboux sum is $0$
and every upper Darboux sum is $1$; hence

$$\underline{\int_0^1}\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}} \;=\; 0 \;\ne\; 1 \;=\; \overline{\int_0^1}\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}} ,$$

and the function is not Riemann integrable. The two Darboux integrals are as far
apart as the range of the function allows.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $g : [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ with $g(x) = 1$ for rational $x$ and $g(x) = 0$ for irrational $x$ ([[def-dirichlet-and-thomae-functions]]).

[A1] The refuted claim: every bounded function on such an interval is Riemann integrable ([[fs-bounded-implies-riemann-integrable]]).

[L1] Both $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}$ are dense in $\mathbb{R}$, so every nonempty open interval contains a rational and an irrational ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L2] For a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[0,1]$: $n \ge 1$, $t_i < t_{i+1}$, $\Delta_i > 0$, $\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = 1$, $I_i = [t_i,t_{i+1}]$, and $(t_i,t_{i+1})$ is a nonempty open interval contained in $I_i$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-interval]]).

[L3] $m_i = \inf g[I_i]$, $M_i = \sup g[I_i]$, $L(g,P) = \sum_{i<n}m_i\Delta_i$, $U(g,P) = \sum_{i<n}M_i\Delta_i$; $\underline{\int_0^1}g$ is the supremum of the lower sums and $\overline{\int_0^1}g$ the infimum of the upper sums; $g$ is integrable exactly when they agree ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L4] A set with a least element has it as its infimum and one with a greatest element has it as its supremum; the supremum and infimum of $\{c\}$ are both $c$ ([[def-infimum]], [[def-max-min]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L5] Finite sums: scaling and $\sum_{i<n}0 = 0$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L6] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 \ne 1$, and the order is total and transitive ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $g$ is bounded, with $0 \le g(x) \le 1$ for every $x \in [0,1]$, so its Darboux sums and integrals are defined by [L3]. [given, L3]

1.2 Let $P = (n,t)$ be any partition of $[0,1]$ and $i < n$. By [L2] the interval $(t_i,t_{i+1})$ is nonempty and open, so by [L1] it contains a rational and an irrational, both lying in $I_i$. Hence $g[I_i] = \{0,1\}$ and, by [L4], $m_i = 0$ and $M_i = 1$. [given, L1, L2, L4]

2.1 Therefore $L(g,P) = \sum_{i<n}0\cdot\Delta_i = 0$ and $U(g,P) = \sum_{i<n}1\cdot\Delta_i = \sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = 1$, for every partition $P$ of $[0,1]$, by [L3], [L5] and [L2]. [step 1.2, L2, L3, L5]

3.1 The set of lower sums is $\{0\}$ and the set of upper sums is $\{1\}$, so $\underline{\int_0^1}g = 0$ and $\overline{\int_0^1}g = 1$ by [L4] and [L3]. Since $0 \ne 1$ by [L6], $g$ is not Riemann integrable on $[0,1]$. [step 2.1, L3, L4, L6]

4.1 So $g$ is bounded on $[0,1]$, an interval with $0 < 1$, and is not Riemann integrable: [A1] is refuted. [step 1.1, step 3.1, A1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The failure is uniform over partitions.** No partition does better than any other here: $U(g,P) - L(g,P) = 1$ for **every** $P$, so Riemann's criterion ([[thm-riemann-criterion]]) fails as badly as it can. Contrast the Cantor-set indicator, where the gap does go to $0$ ([[ex-indicator-of-the-cantor-set-is-integrable-with-integral-zero]]).

- **The Lebesgue criterion gives the same verdict for the same reason.** $g$ is discontinuous at every point of $[0,1]$ ([[thm-dirichlet-and-thomae-continuity-sets]]), and $[0,1]$ is not null ([[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]]), so [[thm-lebesgue-criterion]] refuses it too. The direct computation above is kept because it is elementary and costs no choice principle.

- **The Riemann sums are not even a warning.** Every uniform partition with rational tags gives Riemann sum $1$, so along that one sequence of tagged partitions the sums converge; this is precisely why the Riemann definition quantifies over all tagged partitions of small mesh ([[cex-riemann-sums-along-one-sequence-of-tagged-partitions-do-not-suffice]]).

## Definition

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]) with additive identity $0_F$ and
multiplicative identity $1_F$. Define
$\iota : \mathbb{N} \to F$ by recursion on $\mathbb{N}$
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[thm-recursion]]):

$$\iota(0) \;:=\; 0_F, \qquad \iota(n+1) \;:=\; \iota(n) + 1_F .$$

$\iota(n)$ is the **canonical natural** of $n$ in $F$. It is also written
$n \cdot 1_F$, and for $n \ge 1$ it is $1_F$ added to itself $n$ times.

**Why the notation is needed at all.** A natural number in this library is a von
Neumann natural, that is a set ([[def-natural-numbers]]), and a set is not an
element of $F$. So $1/n$, $n^{\alpha}$ and $x/n$ are not expressions of $F$ when
$n$ is a natural: what they mean is $1/\iota(n)$, $\iota(n)^{\alpha}$ and
$x/\iota(n)$. The map $\iota$ is what carries a counting number into the field,
and writing it is the whole reason a reader meets $1/\iota(k+1)$ where an
informal text would write $1/(k+1)$.

## Remarks

- **Where the index shift comes from.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
  ([[def-natural-numbers]]) and $\iota(0) = 0_F$, so $1/\iota(k)$ is undefined at
  $k = 0$. A family of reciprocals indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ is therefore written
  over $\iota(k+1)$, which is why the harmonic and telescoping families of this
  library run over $k+1$ rather than over $k$. This is bookkeeping, not a
  restriction: the values are the usual ones.

- **This definition records notation; the arithmetic is proved elsewhere.** That
  $\iota$ is strictly increasing and positive on $n \ge 1$, and that it carries
  sums to sums and products to products, is [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], stated
  for an ordered field. That lemma introduces the same element by the equivalent
  recursion $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, which
  agrees with the definition above because $\iota(1) = \iota(0) + 1_F = 1_F$.
  Nothing here is new mathematics; the definition exists so that the notation has
  a home a reader can look up.

- **The symbol $\iota$ is used in this library for other canonical maps, and this
  definition does not govern them.** It also denotes the canonical field
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to F$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), the isometric
  embedding of a metric space into a completion ([[def-metric-completion]]), and
  an inclusion map $\iota : S \to X$ of a subspace. Each of those is introduced
  where it is used and means something different from the map defined here. What
  the four share is only that each is the canonical map of its situation.

- **Fields, not just ordered fields.** The recursion needs no order, so the
  definition is stated for a field; every use in this library is in an ordered
  field, and the order is what makes $\iota$ injective
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). In a field of positive characteristic $\iota$
  is not injective, which is one reason the injectivity is a lemma rather than
  part of the definition.

## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq F$.

- $u \in F$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$; $S$ is
  **bounded above** if it has an upper bound.
- $u \in F$ is a **least upper bound** (or **supremum**, $\sup S$) of $S$ if $u$
  is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le u'$ for every upper bound $u'$ of $S$.

$F$ is a **complete ordered field** (equivalently, $F$ has the
**least-upper-bound property**, or is **Dedekind complete**) if every nonempty
$S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$.

## Remarks

- A least upper bound, if it exists, is unique (two least upper bounds are each
  $\le$ the other, so equal by antisymmetry of the order).
- Applying the property to $\{-s : s \in S\}$ yields the dual **greatest lower
  bound** (infimum) property, so the two are equivalent.
- The Dedekind-cut reals have this property by construction
  ([[thm-dedekind-complete]]); the Cauchy-sequence reals acquire it via
  [[cor-cauchy-reals-lub-complete]]. This definition is the target for the
  uniqueness theorem [[thm-uniqueness-complete-ordered-field]].

## Definition

Let $a < b$ be reals and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]). Write $\mathcal{P}$ for the set of all partitions of
$[a,b]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]) and put

$$\mathcal{L} \;:=\; \{\, L(f,P) \ : \ P \in \mathcal{P} \,\}, \qquad \mathcal{U} \;:=\; \{\, U(f,P) \ : \ P \in \mathcal{P} \,\}$$

for the sets of lower and of upper Darboux sums ([[def-darboux-sums]]).

### Both extrema exist

**$\mathcal{P}$ is nonempty**: the pair $(1, t)$ with $t_0 := a$ and $t_k := b$
for $k \ge 1$ is a partition of $[a,b]$, since $a < b$. So $\mathcal{L}$ and
$\mathcal{U}$ are nonempty.

**$\mathcal{L}$ is bounded above and $\mathcal{U}$ is bounded below.** Fix any
$Q \in \mathcal{P}$. By claim 2 of [[lem-refinement-inequalities]],
$L(f,P) \le U(f,Q)$ for every $P \in \mathcal{P}$, so $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound
of $\mathcal{L}$; and $L(f,Q) \le U(f,P)$ for every $P$, so $L(f,Q)$ is a lower
bound of $\mathcal{U}$.

Hence a nonempty set bounded above has a supremum
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and a nonempty set bounded below has an infimum
([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]), each unique ([[lem-sup-unique]]).
The **lower** and **upper Darboux integrals** of $f$ over $[a,b]$ are the real
numbers

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;:=\; \sup \mathcal{L} \;=\; \sup_{P} L(f,P), \qquad \overline{\int_a^b} f \;:=\; \inf \mathcal{U} \;=\; \inf_{P} U(f,P) .$$

### The lower integral never exceeds the upper one

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f .$$

Indeed, for each fixed $Q \in \mathcal{P}$ the number $U(f,Q)$ is an upper bound
of $\mathcal{L}$, so the least upper bound satisfies
$\underline{\int_a^b} f \le U(f,Q)$. As $Q$ was arbitrary, $\underline{\int_a^b}f$
is a lower bound of $\mathcal{U}$, and the greatest lower bound satisfies
$\underline{\int_a^b} f \le \overline{\int_a^b} f$ ([[def-infimum]]).

Moreover, for **every** partition $P$,

$$L(f,P) \;\le\; \underline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; \overline{\int_a^b} f \;\le\; U(f,P) ,$$

the outer inequalities because a member of a set is at most its supremum and at
least its infimum.

### Integrability

$f$ is **Darboux integrable on $[a,b]$**, and on this page simply
**integrable**, when

$$\underline{\int_a^b} f \;=\; \overline{\int_a^b} f ,$$

and then the common value is written

$$\int_a^b f \qquad \text{or} \qquad \int_a^b f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x ,$$

the **integral of $f$ over $[a,b]$**. It is a single well-determined real
number, being the common value of two numbers each of which is unique
([[lem-sup-unique]]). Without the displayed equality the symbol $\int_a^b f$ is
not defined and is never written.

**The inequality above is the whole difficulty.** By the previous paragraph
integrability is *never* a question of one integral exceeding the other, only of
the gap $\overline{\int_a^b} f - \underline{\int_a^b} f \ge 0$ being $0$; and by
[[thm-riemann-criterion]] that gap is $0$ exactly when a single partition can be
found making $U(f,P) - L(f,P)$ small. Whether that is possible is settled
completely, in terms of the discontinuities of $f$, by
[[thm-lebesgue-criterion]].

**"Riemann integrable" means the same thing here.** The definition above is
Darboux's. Riemann's own definition, in terms of tagged partitions of small
mesh, is [[def-tagged-partition-and-riemann-sum]], and the two define the same
class of functions with the same integral by [[thm-darboux-equals-riemann]].
Until that theorem is proved the two phrases are kept apart; after it they are
used interchangeably, as they are throughout the literature.

## Remarks

- **The supremum is over all partitions, and nothing is selected.** Both
  $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{U}$ are sets determined by $f$ and $[a,b]$ alone,
  and $\sup$ and $\inf$ are canonical, so no choice principle is involved in
  forming either integral. Where a choice does enter on this page is recorded in
  [[rem-riemann-integral-choice-ledger]].

- **Why the lower integral is a supremum and not an infimum.** Refining a
  partition can only increase a lower sum and decrease an upper sum
  ([[lem-refinement-inequalities]]), so the lower sums push up towards the
  integral and the upper sums push down towards it. Taking $\inf \mathcal{L}$
  would return the sum over the coarsest partition and would carry no
  information about $f$ beyond its infimum on $[a,b]$.

- **A bounded $f$ always has both integrals; only their equality can fail.** The
  Dirichlet function on $[0,1]$ has lower integral $0$ and upper integral $1$
  ([[fs-bounded-implies-riemann-integrable]]), which is the standard witness that
  the definition above is not vacuous in either direction.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{N} \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Q} \subseteq
\mathbb{R}$ denotes the chain of canonical embeddings
([[lem-nat-embeds-int]], [[lem-int-embeds-rat]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and
each set is identified with its image in $\mathbb{R}$, as elsewhere in this
library; for a natural $q$ the real $\iota(q) = q \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ is the
canonical natural ([[def-canonical-natural]]), and $\iota(q) > 0$ for $q \ge 1$
([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). A real is **rational** when it lies in
$\mathbb{Q}$ and **irrational** otherwise; both sets are dense in $\mathbb{R}$
([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]).

### The Dirichlet function

$$\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}} : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad \mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(x) := \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } x \in \mathbb{Q},\\ 0 & \text{if } x \notin \mathbb{Q}.\end{cases}$$

This is the indicator of the rationals. It is a function because every real
either lies in $\mathbb{Q}$ or does not, and the two clauses are exclusive.

### The least denominator of a rational

Let $x \in \mathbb{Q}$ and put

$$Q(x) \;:=\; \{\, q \in \mathbb{N} \;:\; q \ge 1 \ \text{ and } \ \iota(q)\,x \in \mathbb{Z} \,\}.$$

**$Q(x)$ is nonempty.** Every rational is $a/b$ with $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $b$ a
positive integer ([[lem-int-embeds-rat]]), and a positive integer is $\iota(q)$
for a unique natural $q \ge 1$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]); then
$\iota(q)\,x = a \in \mathbb{Z}$, so $q \in Q(x)$.

By the well-ordering principle ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]) the nonempty
subset $Q(x) \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ has a least element. Write

$$q(x) \;:=\; \min Q(x) \;\ge\; 1,$$

the **least denominator** of $x$, and $p(x) := \iota(q(x))\,x \in \mathbb{Z}$,
so that

$$x \;=\; \frac{p(x)}{\iota(q(x))} .$$

Nothing is selected here: $q(x)$ is the least element of a set determined by
$x$, so it is a function of $x$ alone.

**The least denominator is the denominator in lowest terms.** The integers
$p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are coprime ([[def-coprime]]). Indeed put
$d := \gcd(p(x), q(x))$, which satisfies $d \ge 1$ because $q(x) \ge 1$ makes the
pair different from $(0,0)$ ([[lem-gcd-basic-values]],
[[def-common-divisor-and-gcd]]). Then $d$ divides $q(x)$, so $q(x)/d$ is a
natural number $\ge 1$, and $\iota(q(x)/d) = \iota(q(x))/d$ because $\iota$
carries products of naturals to products ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]); hence

$$\iota(q(x)/d)\,x \;=\; \frac{\iota(q(x))\,x}{d} \;=\; \frac{p(x)}{d} \;\in\; \mathbb{Z},$$

so $q(x)/d \in Q(x)$ and therefore $q(x)/d \ge q(x)$, which forces $d = 1$.
**Conversely, a lowest-terms denominator is the least one, so the description is
unambiguous.** Suppose $x = p/\iota(q)$ with $q \ge 1$ a natural, $p \in \mathbb{Z}$
and $\gcd(p,q) = 1$. Then $q \in Q(x)$, so $q_{0} := q(x) \le q$; and from
$p/\iota(q) = p(x)/\iota(q_{0})$ we get $q_{0}p = q\,p(x)$ in $\mathbb{Z}$, so
$q \mid q_{0}p$, and $\gcd(p,q) = 1$ gives $q \mid q_{0}$
([[lem-coprime-divides-product]], claim 1), hence $q \le q_{0}$. So $q = q(x)$:
writing $x = p/q$ "in lowest terms with $q \ge 1$" and taking $q = q(x)$ describe
the same integer, and [[cor-gcd-quotients-coprime]] is what produces such a
representation from an arbitrary one.

### Thomae's function

$$t : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad t(x) := \begin{cases} 1/\iota(q(x)) & \text{if } x \in \mathbb{Q},\\ 0 & \text{if } x \notin \mathbb{Q}.\end{cases}$$

It is also called the **popcorn function** or the **ruler function**. The value
is well defined because $q(x)$ is, and $\iota(q(x)) \ge 1 > 0$ is invertible.

**Boundary values, stated rather than left to the reader.**

- $t(0) = 1$. Indeed $\iota(1)\cdot 0 = 0 \in \mathbb{Z}$, so $1 \in Q(0)$ and
  $q(0) = 1$; the representation is $0 = 0/1$.
- $t(m) = 1$ for every integer $m$, by the same computation with $1 \in Q(m)$.
- $0 < t(x) \le 1$ for every rational $x$, since $\iota(q(x)) \ge 1$; and
  $t(x) = 0$ exactly at the irrationals.

**On the range.** The values of $t$ are $0$ and the reciprocals
$1/\iota(q)$ of the canonical naturals $q \ge 1$; every such value is attained,
$1/\iota(q)$ being the value at the rational $1/\iota(q)$ itself, whose least
denominator is $q$ because $\iota(k)/\iota(q) \in \mathbb{Z}$ with
$1 \le k < q$ would give a positive integer smaller than $1$.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ ([[def-field]]) together with a subset
$P \subseteq F$, the set of **positive** elements (the *positive cone*),
satisfying:

- **(O1) Trichotomy.** For each $x \in F$, exactly one of the following holds:
  $x \in P$, or $x = 0$, or $-x \in P$.
- **(O2) Closure.** If $x, y \in P$ then $x + y \in P$ and $x \cdot y \in P$.

We write $x > 0$ for $x \in P$ (read "$x$ is positive"), and define the order by

$$a < b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; b - a \in P, \qquad a \le b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; a < b \text{ or } a = b.$$

Thus $a > b$ means $b < a$, and $a \ge b$ means $b \le a$. An element $x$ with
$-x \in P$ (equivalently $x < 0$) is called **negative**.

## Remarks

- By trichotomy applied to $b - a$, for any $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$,
  $a = b$, $a > b$ holds; this makes $\le$ a total order.
- (O2) says the positives are closed under addition and multiplication: sums and
  products of positives are positive.
- The rationals ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and both constructions of the reals
  ([[thm-reals-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-dedekind-ordered-field]]) are ordered
  fields, so every fact proved here from (O1)-(O2) holds in each of them.

## Example

Let $t : [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ be Thomae's function restricted to $[0,1]$: at a
rational $x$ with least denominator $q(x) \ge 1$ it takes the value
$1/\iota(q(x))$, and at an irrational $x$ the value $0$
([[def-dirichlet-and-thomae-functions]], [[def-canonical-natural]]). Then $t$ is
Riemann integrable on $[0,1]$ and

$$\int_0^1 t \;=\; 0 .$$

**Two ingredients, and they pull in opposite directions.** $t$ is continuous at
every irrational and discontinuous at every rational
([[thm-dirichlet-and-thomae-continuity-sets]]), so its discontinuity set is
$\mathbb{Q}\cap[0,1]$, which is infinite and dense — and countable, which is what
[[cor-countably-many-discontinuities-integrable]] needs. The value is then read
off the lower sums, every one of which is $0$ because every subinterval contains
an irrational ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]).

Every **upper** sum, by contrast, is strictly positive, since every subinterval
contains a rational; the upper integral is nevertheless $0$, an infimum of
positive numbers.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Thomae's function $t : [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ as above.

[L1] $t(x) = 1/\iota(q(x))$ with $\iota(q(x)) \ge 1 > 0$ at a rational $x$, and $t(x) = 0$ at an irrational $x$; hence $0 \le t(x) \le 1$ everywhere and $t(x) > 0$ at every rational $x$ ([[def-dirichlet-and-thomae-functions]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L2] Thomae's function on $\mathbb{R}$ is continuous at every irrational and discontinuous at every rational ([[thm-dirichlet-and-thomae-continuity-sets]]); a restriction is continuous at every point of the smaller domain at which the original is continuous, the same $\delta$ serving a condition quantified over fewer points ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L3] $\mathbb{Q}$ is countably infinite and every subset of an at most countable set is at most countable ([[thm-rationals-countable]], [[lem-subset-of-countable]], [[def-countable]]).

[L4] A bounded function on $[a,b]$ with $a < b$ whose set of discontinuities is at most countable is Riemann integrable ([[cor-countably-many-discontinuities-integrable]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L5] The irrationals are dense in $\mathbb{R}$, so every nonempty open interval contains an irrational ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L6] For a partition $P = (n,s)$ of $[0,1]$: $n \ge 1$, $s_i < s_{i+1}$, $\Delta_i > 0$, $I_i = [s_i,s_{i+1}] \subseteq [0,1]$, and $(s_i,s_{i+1})$ is a nonempty open interval ([[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-interval]]).

[L7] $m_i = \inf t[I_i]$, $L(t,P) = \sum_{i<n}m_i\Delta_i$, $\underline{\int_0^1}t$ is the supremum of the lower sums and $\overline{\int_0^1}t$ the infimum of the upper sums, and the integral is their common value when they agree ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L8] A set with a least element has it as its infimum; the supremum of $\{0\}$ is $0$ ([[def-infimum]], [[def-max-min]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L9] Finite sums: $\sum_{i<n}0 = 0$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L10] Ordered-field arithmetic: the order is total and transitive, and a reciprocal of a positive quantity is positive ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Verification

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $t$ is bounded on $[0,1]$, with $0 \le t(x) \le 1$ for every $x$, by [L1]. [given, L1, L10]

1.2 By [L2], $t$ is continuous at every irrational point of $[0,1]$, so its set of discontinuities in $[0,1]$ is contained in $\mathbb{Q}\cap[0,1]$, which is at most countable by [L3]; a subset of it is then at most countable as well. [given, L2, L3]

2.1 By [L4] applied on $[0,1]$, with $0 < 1$, $t$ is Riemann integrable on $[0,1]$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L4]

2.2 **Every lower sum is $0$.** Let $P = (n,s)$ be a partition of $[0,1]$ and $i < n$. By [L6] the interval $(s_i,s_{i+1})$ is nonempty and open, so by [L5] it contains an irrational $y$, and $y \in I_i \subseteq [0,1]$, so $t(y) = 0$ by [L1]. Since $t \ge 0$ by [L1], the value $0$ is the least element of $t[I_i]$ and $m_i = 0$ by [L8]. Hence $L(t,P) = 0$ by [L7] and [L9]. [step 1.1, L1, L5, L6, L7, L8, L9]

3.1 The set of lower sums is therefore $\{0\}$ and $\underline{\int_0^1}t = 0$ by [L8]; since $t$ is integrable by step 2.1, $\int_0^1 t = 0$ by [L7]. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L7, L8] ∎

## Remarks

- **The discontinuity set is dense and the function is still integrable.** $\mathbb{Q}\cap[0,1]$ meets every subinterval of $[0,1]$, so no partition isolates the bad points; what saves the function is that the set is countable, hence null ([[lem-countable-sets-are-null]]). This is the cleanest witness that "small" for integrability means small in measure and not small in category or in closure.

- **The same function refutes a plausible converse.** $t$ is nonnegative, integrable with integral $0$, and positive at every rational, so a vanishing integral does not force a nonnegative integrand to vanish ([[cex-nonnegative-integrable-with-zero-integral-need-not-vanish]], [[fs-nonnegative-integrable-with-zero-integral-vanishes]]).

- **Contrast with the Dirichlet function.** $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ is discontinuous everywhere and not integrable ([[cex-dirichlet-is-not-riemann-integrable]]), yet it is nonzero at exactly the same points as $t$. Only the values differ, and they differ in a way that makes $t$ continuous at every irrational; that is the whole of the difference.

## Statement

**False claim:** if $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is Riemann integrable
([[def-darboux-integral]]) with $f(x) \ge 0$ for every $x \in [a,b]$ and
$\int_a^b f = 0$, then $f(x) = 0$ for every $x \in [a,b]$.

The claim is true under the additional hypothesis that $f$ is continuous, and
that is the version worth remembering; without it the integral simply cannot see
a function that is positive on a null set. Thomae's function on $[0,1]$
([[def-dirichlet-and-thomae-functions]]) is nonnegative, integrable, has
integral $0$, and is positive at **every** rational point of $[0,1]$, of which
there are infinitely many.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Thomae's function restricted to $[0,1]$, that is $t : [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ with $t(x) = 1/\iota(q(x))$ at a rational $x$ with least denominator $q(x) \ge 1$, and $t(x) = 0$ at an irrational $x$ ([[def-dirichlet-and-thomae-functions]], [[def-canonical-natural]]).

[A1] The false claim: a nonnegative Riemann integrable function on a closed bounded interval with distinct endpoints whose integral is $0$ vanishes identically.

[L1] $t(x) = 1/\iota(q(x))$ with $\iota(q(x)) \ge 1 > 0$ at a rational $x$, and $t(x) = 0$ at an irrational $x$; hence $0 \le t(x) \le 1$ everywhere and $t(x) > 0$ at every rational $x$ ([[def-dirichlet-and-thomae-functions]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L2] Thomae's function on $\mathbb{R}$ is continuous at every irrational and discontinuous at every rational ([[thm-dirichlet-and-thomae-continuity-sets]]); a restriction of a function continuous at a point of the smaller domain is continuous there, the same $\delta$ serving a condition quantified over fewer points ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L3] $\mathbb{Q}$ is countably infinite, and every subset of an at most countable set is at most countable ([[thm-rationals-countable]], [[lem-subset-of-countable]], [[def-countable]]).

[L4] A bounded function on $[a,b]$ with an at most countable set of discontinuities is Riemann integrable ([[cor-countably-many-discontinuities-integrable]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L5] The irrationals are dense in $\mathbb{R}$, so every nonempty open interval contains an irrational ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L6] For a partition $P = (n,t^{P})$ of $[0,1]$: $n \ge 1$, $t^{P}_i < t^{P}_{i+1}$, $\Delta_i > 0$, and $I_i = [t^{P}_i, t^{P}_{i+1}] \subseteq [0,1]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]], [[def-interval]]).

[L7] $L(t,P) = \sum_{i<n}m_i\Delta_i$ with $m_i = \inf t[I_i]$; $\underline{\int_0^1} t$ is the supremum of the lower sums, $\overline{\int_0^1} t$ the infimum of the upper sums, and the integral is their common value when they agree ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-darboux-integral]]).

[L8] A set with a least element has it as its infimum; the supremum of $\{0\}$ is $0$ ([[def-infimum]], [[def-max-min]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L9] Finite sums: $\sum_{i<n}0 = 0$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L10] Ordered-field arithmetic: the order is total and transitive; a reciprocal of a positive quantity is positive; $0 < 1$ ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $t$ is nonnegative and bounded on $[0,1]$, with $0 \le t(x) \le 1$ for every $x$, by [L1]. [given, L1, L10]

1.2 $t$ is continuous at every irrational point of $[0,1]$ by [L2], so its set of discontinuities in $[0,1]$ is contained in $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$, which is at most countable by [L3]; every subset of it is then at most countable by [L3] as well. [given, L2, L3]

1.3 Separately, and independently of everything below, $t$ does not vanish identically: $2^{-1}$ is a rational point of $[0,1]$, so $t(2^{-1}) > 0$ by [L1] and [L10]. [L1, L10]

2.1 By [L4] applied to $[0,1]$, with $0 < 1$, the function $t$ is Riemann integrable on $[0,1]$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L4]

2.2 Every lower Darboux sum of $t$ is $0$: let $P$ be a partition of $[0,1]$ and $i < n$; the open interval $(t^{P}_i, t^{P}_{i+1})$ is nonempty by [L6] and contains an irrational $y$ by [L5], and $y \in I_i \subseteq [0,1]$, so $t(y) = 0$ by [L1]. Since $t \ge 0$ by [L1], the value $0$ is the least element of $t[I_i]$ and $m_i = 0$ by [L8]. Hence $L(t,P) = \sum_{i<n}0\cdot\Delta_i = 0$ by [L7] and [L9]. [step 1.1, L1, L5, L6, L7, L8, L9]

3.1 The set of lower sums is therefore $\{0\}$, so $\underline{\int_0^1} t = 0$ by [L8], and since $t$ is integrable by step 2.1 its integral is $\int_0^1 t = 0$ by [L7]. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L7, L8]

4.1 So $t$ is a nonnegative Riemann integrable function on $[0,1]$ with $\int_0^1 t = 0$ that is not identically zero; [A1] fails at $t$ and the claim is false. [step 1.1, step 3.1, step 1.3, A1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The correct statement, and the hypothesis that repairs it.** If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, nonnegative and $\int_a^b f = 0$, then $f \equiv 0$: a point with $f(c) > 0$ would, by continuity, force $f > f(c)\cdot 2^{-1}$ on a whole subinterval, and $\int_a^b f$ would then be at least $f(c)\cdot 2^{-1}$ times the length of that subinterval, by [[lem-integral-elementary-bounds]] applied there. That argument is not carried out here, because the additivity of the integral over subintervals is not available at this point in the reading order; what is asserted by this item is only that the hypothesis of continuity cannot simply be dropped.

- **The exceptional set is exactly the rationals.** $t$ is positive precisely on $\mathbb{Q}\cap[0,1]$, a countable dense set, which is null ([[lem-countable-sets-are-null]]). The integral is blind to a null set of positive values, and the Lebesgue criterion explains why: what governs integrability, and here the value, is the size of the set where the function misbehaves, measured by interval covers ([[thm-lebesgue-criterion]]).

- **Every upper sum, by contrast, is positive.** Each subinterval contains a rational, so $M_i > 0$ for every $i$ and $U(t,P) > 0$ for every partition $P$; the upper integral is nevertheless $0$, since the infimum of a set of positive numbers may be $0$. That is the one place where this example is worth pausing over, and it is the reason the lower sums, not the upper ones, are what step 2.2 computes.

## Statement

Every at most countable set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-countable]]) has
measure zero ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

The cover is explicit: the $k$-th point of a listing of $A$ is put inside an
interval of length $\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-k-1}$, and the lengths sum to
$\varepsilon$ by [[thm-geometric-series]]. **No choice principle is used**: a
listing of $A$ is a single object, fixed once ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]]),
and everything after that is a formula in $k$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An at most countable set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a real $\varepsilon > 0$. Throughout, $\theta := 2^{-1}$.

[L1] $A$ is null when for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there are sequences $(a_k)$, $(b_k)$ with $a_k \le b_k$, $A \subseteq \bigcup_k [a_k,b_k]$, and $\sum_{k<n}(b_k - a_k) \le \varepsilon$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

[L2] $[c,d] = \{\, x : c \le x \le d \,\}$ has length $d - c$ when $c \le d$, and $[c,c] = \{c\}$ has length $0$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L3] A nonempty at most countable set admits a surjection $s : \mathbb{N} \to A$ ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]], [[def-countable]]).

[L4] Powers and the geometric series: $\theta^0 = 1$, $\theta^{k+1} = \theta^k\theta$, $\theta^k > 0$, and $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\theta^k = 2$ for $\theta = 2^{-1}$; a series of nonnegative terms has all its partial sums at most its sum ([[def-integer-power]], [[thm-geometric-series]], [[def-series]], [[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]]).

[L5] Finite sums: scaling by a constant, and $\sum_{k<n} 0 = 0$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L6] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 > 0$, $4 > 0$ and $t \cdot 4^{-1} > 0$ for $t > 0$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve an inequality ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let the real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. If $A = \varnothing$, the constant sequences $a_k := 0$ and $b_k := 0$ satisfy $A \subseteq \bigcup_k [0,0]$ vacuously and $\sum_{k<n}(b_k - a_k) = 0 \le \varepsilon$ for every $n$ by [L5], so the condition of [L1] holds at this $\varepsilon$. Assume from now on that $A \ne \varnothing$ and, by [L3], fix a surjection $s : \mathbb{N} \to A$. [given, L1, L2, L3, L5, choose]

2.1 Put $\delta_k := \varepsilon \cdot 4^{-1} \cdot \theta^{k}$, a positive real by [L4] and [L6], and $a_k := s(k) - \delta_k$, $b_k := s(k) + \delta_k$; then $a_k \le b_k$ and $s(k) \in [a_k,b_k]$ by [L6], so $A = \{\, s(k) : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\} \subseteq \bigcup_k [a_k, b_k]$ by step 1.1. The length of $[a_k,b_k]$ is $b_k - a_k = 2\delta_k = \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} \cdot \theta^{k}$ by [L2] and [L6]. [step 1.1, L2, L4, L6]

3.1 For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $\sum_{k<n}(b_k - a_k) = \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} \sum_{k<n}\theta^{k} \le \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} \cdot 2 = \varepsilon$, using scaling from [L5] and the bound on the partial sums of the geometric series from [L4]. [step 2.1, L4, L5, L6]

4.1 So for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the sequences of step 2.1 cover $A$ with all partial total lengths at most $\varepsilon$, which by [L1] is exactly the statement that $A$ has measure zero; the empty case was settled in step 1.1. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 3.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Indexing.** Sequences here start at $k = 0$, and the first interval has
  length $\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$, not $\varepsilon$. The total is
  $\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} \sum_{k \ge 0} 2^{-k} = \varepsilon$ exactly, so the
  cover is as tight as the definition allows and nothing is wasted at the first
  index.

- **Repetitions are harmless.** A surjection $s$ may repeat values, and a finite
  set is covered by infinitely many intervals, most of them redundant. This is
  why the listing form of countability ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]])
  is the convenient one: no injectivity and no case split between the finite and
  the countably infinite case is needed.

- **The converse fails badly.** The Cantor set is uncountable and null
  ([[thm-cantor-set-properties]]), so "null" is very far from "countable"; and
  the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set is uncountable and not null
  ([[thm-fat-cantor-set-has-positive-measure]]), so cardinality decides nothing
  either way.

- **Density decides nothing either.** $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable, hence null, and
  is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[cex-dense-set-of-measure-zero]]); a null set may
  therefore meet every interval.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b, c, d \in F$.

1. **Translation invariance.** If $a < b$ then $a + c < b + c$.
2. **Adding inequalities.** If $a < b$ and $c < d$ then $a + c < b + d$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b, c, d \in F$.

[L1] For $x, y \in F$, the relation $x < y$ means $y - x \in P$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] $P$ is closed under addition: if $u, v \in P$ then $u + v \in P$ (axiom O2 of [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a < b$; by the definition of the order this means $b - a \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.2 For every $c \in F$ the field identities give $(b + c) - (a + c) = b - a$. [algebra]

1.3 Assume moreover $c < d$; by the definition of the order this means $d - c \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1]

1.4 The field identities give $(b + d) - (a + c) = (b - a) + (d - c)$. [algebra]

2.1 Hence $(b + c) - (a + c) = b - a \in P$, which is exactly $a + c < b + c$, proving claim 1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1]

2.2 Since $b - a \in P$ and $d - c \in P$, closure under addition gives $(b - a) + (d - c) \in P$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, L2]

3.1 Therefore $(b + d) - (a + c) = (b - a) + (d - c) \in P$, which is exactly $a + c < b + d$, proving claim 2. [step 1.4, step 2.2, L1] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field, with field structure as in [[def-field]], and for
$n \ge 1$ let $n \cdot 1_F$ denote the canonical natural number
$\underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$, defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$
and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$. Then for every $n \ge 1$:

- $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$;
- the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$;
- $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ and $(mn) \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F)$ for all $m, n \ge 1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ whose canonical naturals are defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, with $0 \cdot 1_F = 0$.

[L1] $0 < 1_F$ in every ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] The order is compatible with addition and positives are closed under addition: $a < b$ implies $a + c < b + c$, and $a > 0$, $b > 0$ imply $a + b > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 1$: by definition $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, and $1_F > 0$. [L1, base]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: assume $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for some fixed $n \ge 1$. [ih]

1.3 By the recursion, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F - n \cdot 1_F = 1_F > 0$, so $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$. [given, L1]

1.4 Additive identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ by the recursion, and if $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ then $(m+n+1) \cdot 1_F = (m+n) \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + (n+1) \cdot 1_F$. [given, algebra]

2.1 Inductive step: $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ is a sum of two positives, by the hypothesis and $1_F > 0$, hence $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Iterating 1.3, for $m < n$ one has $m \cdot 1_F < n \cdot 1_F$, so $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing and therefore injective on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$. [step 1.3, L2]

2.3 Multiplicative identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m \cdot 1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(1 \cdot 1_F)$, and the step $(m(n+1)) \cdot 1_F = (mn + m) \cdot 1_F = (mn) \cdot 1_F + m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F) + (m \cdot 1_F)(1_F) = (m \cdot 1_F)((n+1) \cdot 1_F)$ uses 1.4 and distributivity. [step 1.4, algebra]

3.1 By induction on 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for every $n \ge 1$; with the strict increase 2.2 and the identities 1.4, 2.3, every claim holds. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 1.4, step 2.3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and
let $a, b, c \in F$.

1. If $a > 0$ and $b > 0$ then $ab > 0$.
2. If $a > 0$ and $b < 0$ then $ab < 0$.
3. If $a < 0$ and $b < 0$ then $ab > 0$.
4. If $c > 0$ then $a < b \iff ac < bc$.
5. If $c < 0$ then $a < b \iff bc < ac$ (multiplication by a negative reverses order).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b, c \in F$.

[L1] For $x, y \in F$: $x < y \iff y - x \in P$; $x > 0 \iff x \in P$; $x < 0 \iff -x \in P$; and (trichotomy) for each $x$ exactly one of $x \in P$, $x = 0$, $-x \in P$ holds, so $0 \notin P$ and $x \in P \Rightarrow x \neq 0$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] $P$ is closed under multiplication: if $u, v \in P$ then $uv \in P$ (axiom O2 of [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] In any field, $(-u)v = -(uv)$ and $(-u)(-v) = uv$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] In any field, $0 \cdot u = 0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a > 0$ and $b > 0$, i.e. $a \in P$ and $b \in P$; closure gives $ab \in P$, so $ab > 0$, proving claim 1. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.2 Assume $a > 0$ and $b < 0$, i.e. $a \in P$ and $-b \in P$; closure gives $a(-b) \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.3 Assume $a < 0$ and $b < 0$, i.e. $-a \in P$ and $-b \in P$; closure gives $(-a)(-b) \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.4 Assume $c > 0$ and $a < b$, i.e. $c \in P$ and $b - a \in P$; closure gives $(b - a)c \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.5 Assume $c < 0$ and $a < b$, i.e. $-c \in P$ and $b - a \in P$; closure gives $(b - a)(-c) \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

2.1 Since $a(-b) = -(ab)$ by L3, step 1.2 gives $-(ab) \in P$, so $ab < 0$, proving claim 2. [step 1.2, L3, L1]

2.2 Since $(-a)(-b) = ab$ by L3, step 1.3 gives $ab \in P$, so $ab > 0$, proving claim 3. [step 1.3, L3, L1]

2.3 By distributivity $(b - a)c = bc - ac$, so step 1.4 gives $bc - ac \in P$, i.e. $ac < bc$: this is the forward direction of claim 4. [step 1.4, algebra, L1]

2.4 By L3 and distributivity $(b - a)(-c) = -((b - a)c) = -(bc - ac) = ac - bc$, so step 1.5 gives $ac - bc \in P$, i.e. $bc < ac$: this is the forward direction of claim 5. [step 1.5, L3, algebra, L1]

3.1 Conversely, assume $c > 0$ and $ac < bc$; by trichotomy exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds. If $a = b$ then $ac = bc$, contradicting $ac < bc$; if $b < a$ then the argument of step 2.3 applied to the pair $b < a$ gives $bc < ac$, so $bc - ac \in P$ (from $ac < bc$) while $ac - bc \in P$ (from $bc < ac$), putting the element $bc - ac$ and its negative $ac - bc$ both in $P$, which trichotomy forbids; hence $a < b$: this completes claim 4. [assume-hyp, step 2.3, L4, L1, algebra]

4.1 Conversely, assume $c < 0$ and $bc < ac$; by trichotomy exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds. If $a = b$ then $ac = bc$, contradicting $bc < ac$; if $b < a$ then the argument of step 2.4 applied to the pair $b < a$ gives $ac < bc$, so $ac - bc \in P$ (from $bc < ac$) while $bc - ac \in P$ (from $ac < bc$), putting the element $ac - bc$ and its negative $bc - ac$ both in $P$, which trichotomy forbids; hence $a < b$: this completes claim 5.

## Statement

Write $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the image of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$
under the canonical embedding $q \mapsto \hat q$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), the
set usually written $\mathbb{Q}$ once the identification is made, and put
$X := \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the irrationals. Then:

1. $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$, that is,
   $\overline{\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}} = \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]);
2. $X$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$;
3. every nonempty open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable
   ([[def-countable]]).

Claim 2 is not a symmetry of claim 1: the rationals are dense because they are
*constructed* to approximate, whereas the irrationals are dense because there are
too many points in any interval for a countable set to exhaust it, which is why
claim 3 is proved alongside and used for it.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The canonical embedding $q \mapsto \hat q$ of $\mathbb{Q}$ into $\mathbb{R}$, its image $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, and the complement $X = \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$.

[L1] $\overline{A}$ is the set of points every neighbourhood of which meets $A$; $A$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ when $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L2] $N_\varepsilon(x) = (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon)$ for real $\varepsilon > 0$, and $x - \varepsilon < x + \varepsilon$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L3] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L4] Strictly between any two reals lies an element of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, and $q \mapsto \hat q$ is injective ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L5] $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-rationals-countable]]); an injection is a bijection onto its image, and $\approx$ is symmetric and transitive ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]], [[def-equinumerous]]).

[L6] Every subset of an at most countable set is at most countable, and uncountable means not at most countable ([[lem-subset-of-countable]], [[def-countable]]).

[L7] For $a < b$ the interval $(a,b)$ is uncountable ([[cor-interval-uncountable]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is dense: let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real; by [L2] one has $x - \varepsilon < x + \varepsilon$, so [L4] supplies $\hat q$ with $x - \varepsilon < \hat q < x + \varepsilon$, that is $\hat q \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$. Every real is therefore an adherent point of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and claim 1 follows from [L1]. [L1, L2, L4]

1.2 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is at most countable: the embedding is an injection of $\mathbb{Q}$ with image $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, hence a bijection onto it, so $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \approx \mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$. [L4, L5]

1.3 For all reals $a < b$ the interval $(a,b)$ is uncountable. [L7]

2.1 For all reals $a < b$ the interval $(a,b)$ contains an irrational: if it did not, then $(a,b) \subseteq \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, so $(a,b)$ would be a subset of an at most countable set by step 1.2 and hence at most countable by [L6], contradicting step 1.3. So some $z \in (a,b)$ lies in $X$. [step 1.2, step 1.3, L6]

2.2 Every nonempty open $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is uncountable: fix $x \in U$ and, by [L3], a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; by [L2] the set $N_\varepsilon(x)$ is the interval $(x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon)$ with $x - \varepsilon < x + \varepsilon$, hence uncountable by step 1.3. Were $U$ at most countable, its subset $N_\varepsilon(x)$ would be at most countable by [L6], which it is not; so $U$ is uncountable, which is claim 3. [step 1.3, L2, L3, L6, choose]

3.1 $X$ is dense: let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real; applying step 2.1 with $a = x - \varepsilon$ and $b = x + \varepsilon$ gives $z \in (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon) \cap X$, which is $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap X$ by [L2]. Every real is therefore an adherent point of $X$, so $\overline{X} = \mathbb{R}$ by [L1], which is claim 2. [step 2.1, L1, L2]

4.1 Claims 1, 2 and 3 are steps 1.1, 3.1 and 2.2, so both $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and its complement are dense in $\mathbb{R}$ and every nonempty open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable. [step 1.1, step 2.2, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Two dense sets can be disjoint.** $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and $X$ partition
  $\mathbb{R}$ and both are dense, so density says nothing about size: one of
  them is countable and the other is not
  ([[cor-irrationals-uncountable]]). What density does say is that neither has
  interior: a set whose complement is dense has empty interior, which is the
  computation carried out for $\mathbb{Q}$ in
  [[ex-closure-interior-boundary-of-q]].

- **Claim 3 is a statement about open sets, not about intervals.** It follows
  from the uncountability of intervals ([[cor-interval-uncountable]]) only
  because openness supplies an interval inside the set at each of its points.
  A nonempty set with empty interior can perfectly well be countable, as
  $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ shows.

- **An explicit irrational is not produced here.** Step 2.1 is a counting

  $q_1 + (q_2 - q_1)/\sqrt 2$ for suitable rationals $q_1 < q_2$ in the
  interval; that route is longer and is not the one taken above.

## Statement

Let $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ and $t$ be the Dirichlet and Thomae functions
([[def-dirichlet-and-thomae-functions]]), and write $q(x)$ for the least
denominator of a rational $x$, so that $t(x) = 1/\iota(q(x))$ there and
$t(x) = 0$ at every irrational $x$. Then:

1. $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ is continuous at **no** point of $\mathbb{R}$
   ([[def-continuity-real]]);
2. $\omega_{t}(c) = t(c)$ for **every** real $c$ ([[def-oscillation]]);
3. $t$ is continuous at every irrational and discontinuous at every rational, so
   its set of continuity points is exactly $\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$.

**Claim 1 restates, on this page, what
[[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]] already proves.** That item is homed on
the examples page of *Continuity, the intermediate and extreme value theorems,
and uniform continuity*, and an examples page is a leaf of this library: nothing
outside it may depend on an item that lives there. The claim is needed here, and
on later pages, as a citable statement, so it is proved again rather than
quoted. The two statements are the same statement, and neither is stronger than
the other; the proof below is the same argument, and no originality is claimed
for it. This is the pattern
[[ex-distance-to-the-integers-is-1-lipschitz]] follows.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The Dirichlet function $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ and Thomae's function $t$, and a real $c$; $\mathbb{N} \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ are the canonical copies and $\iota(q) = q \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$.

[A1] $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(x) = 1$ for $x \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $0$ otherwise; $t(x) = 1/\iota(q(x)) \in (0,1]$ for $x \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $t(x) = 0$ otherwise, where $q(x) = \min\{q \ge 1 : \iota(q)x \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ ([[def-dirichlet-and-thomae-functions]]).

[L1] Both $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$ are dense in $\mathbb{R}$, so every $N_\delta(y)$ contains a rational and an irrational ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L2] For every real $x$ there is exactly one integer $m$ with $m \le x < m+1$, written $\lfloor x \rfloor$ ([[lem-integer-part]]); consequently no integer lies strictly between two consecutive integers.

[L3] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N) < \eta$; and $\iota$ is positive and strictly increasing on the naturals $\ge 1$, so $1 \le q \le N$ gives $\iota(q) \le \iota(N)$ and $1/\iota(N) \le 1/\iota(q)$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L4] A nonempty finite set of reals presented as $\{a_{0}, \dots, a_{n}\}$ has a minimum ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L5] $\omega_{f}(S) = \sup\{|f(x)-f(y)| : x,y \in S\}$ and $\omega_{f}(c) = \inf\{\omega_{f}(N_\delta(c)) : \delta > 0\}$ for $f$ defined on all of $\mathbb{R}$, both computed in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, where every set has a supremum and an infimum; $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if $\omega_{f}(c) = 0$ ([[def-oscillation]], [[def-extended-reals]], [[lem-extended-reals-complete]], [[thm-continuity-iff-oscillation-zero]]).

[L6] $|u| \ge 0$, $|u - v| \le |u| + |v|$, and if $0 \le u \le M$ and $0 \le v \le M$ then $|u - v| \le M$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Claim 1. Let $c$ be real and let $\delta > 0$ be real. The neighbourhood $N_\delta(c)$ contains a rational $u$ and an irrational $v$, and $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(u) - \mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(v) = 1 - 0 = 1$; since $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(c)$ is $0$ or $1$, one of $|\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(u) - \mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(c)|$ and $|\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(v) - \mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(c)|$ equals $1$. So the continuity condition at $c$ fails for $\varepsilon = 1$, no $\delta$ witnessing it, and $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ is continuous at no point. [A1, L1]

1.2 **A separation estimate.** For a real $c$ and a natural $q \ge 1$ put $m := \lfloor \iota(q)c \rfloor$ and define $d_{q}(c) := 1/\iota(q)$ if $\iota(q)c = m$, and $d_{q}(c) := \min\{\iota(q)c - m,\ m + 1 - \iota(q)c\}/\iota(q)$ otherwise. In both cases $d_{q}(c) > 0$. [L2, L3, construct]

1.3 **A lower bound.** For every real $\delta > 0$ the neighbourhood $N_\delta(c)$ contains an irrational $v$, and $c \in N_\delta(c)$, so $\omega_{t}(N_\delta(c)) \ge |t(c) - t(v)| = t(c)$; taking the infimum over $\delta$ gives $\omega_{t}(c) \ge t(c)$. [A1, L1, L5]

2.1 With $d_{q}(c)$ as in step 1.2: for every integer $p$ with $p/\iota(q) \ne c$ one has $|c - p/\iota(q)| \ge d_{q}(c)$. If $\iota(q)c = m$ then $p \ne m$, so $|\iota(q)c - p| = |m - p| \ge 1$; otherwise $m < \iota(q)c < m+1$, and $p \le m$ gives $\iota(q)c - p \ge \iota(q)c - m$ while $p \ge m+1$ gives $p - \iota(q)c \ge m+1-\iota(q)c$. Dividing by $\iota(q) > 0$ gives the claim. [step 1.2, L2, L3]

2.2 For a real $c$ and a natural $N \ge 1$ put $\delta_{N}(c) := \min\{d_{1}(c), \dots, d_{N}(c)\}$, the minimum of a nonempty finite set of positive reals, so $\delta_{N}(c) > 0$. [step 1.2, L4, construct]

3.1 If $x$ is rational with $0 < |x - c| < \delta_{N}(c)$ then $q(x) > N$ and hence $t(x) < 1/\iota(N)$. Indeed $x = p/\iota(q)$ with $q := q(x)$ and $p := \iota(q)x$; if $q \le N$ then $p/\iota(q) = x \ne c$, so step 2.1 gives $|c - x| \ge d_{q}(c) \ge \delta_{N}(c)$, contrary to the hypothesis. So $q(x) > N$, and $t(x) = 1/\iota(q(x)) < 1/\iota(N)$ because $\iota$ is strictly increasing. [step 2.1, step 2.2, A1, L3]

4.1 **An upper bound for $t$ near $c$.** Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real, take $N \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(N) < \varepsilon$ and put $\delta := \delta_{N}(c)$. Every $x \in N_\delta(c)$ satisfies $0 \le t(x) \le M$ where $M := \max\{t(c), \varepsilon\}$: for $x = c$ this is $t(c) \le M$; for $x \ne c$ rational it is $t(x) < 1/\iota(N) < \varepsilon \le M$ by step 3.1; and for $x$ irrational it is $t(x) = 0$. [step 3.1, A1, L3, L6]

5.1 Hence $\omega_{t}(N_\delta(c)) \le M$ with $\delta$ and $M$ as in step 4.1, since $|t(x) - t(y)| \le M$ for all $x, y \in N_\delta(c)$, so $M$ is an upper bound of the set whose supremum $\omega_{t}(N_\delta(c))$ is; and therefore $\omega_{t}(c) \le M = \max\{t(c), \varepsilon\}$. [step 4.1, L5, L6]

6.1 Claim 2 now follows in the two cases of the value $t(c)$, which are exactly the two cases of the position of $c$. If $c$ is rational then $t(c) > 0$, and applying step 5.1 with the admissible choice $\varepsilon := t(c)$ gives $\omega_{t}(c) \le \max\{t(c), t(c)\} = t(c)$; with step 1.3 this gives $\omega_{t}(c) = t(c)$. [step 5.1, step 1.3, A1, assume-case rat]

6.2 If $c$ is irrational then $t(c) = 0$, and step 5.1 gives $\omega_{t}(c) \le \max\{0, \varepsilon\} = \varepsilon$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$; since also $\omega_{t}(c) \ge 0$, an extended real that is $\le \varepsilon$ for every positive real $\varepsilon$ and $\ge 0$ must be $0$, so $\omega_{t}(c) = 0 = t(c)$. [step 5.1, step 1.3, A1, L5, assume-case irr]

7.1 Every real is rational or irrational and not both, so steps 6.1 and 6.2 establish claim 2 for every real $c$. [step 6.1, step 6.2, cases-exhaustive]

8.1 Claim 3 follows from claim 2: $t$ is continuous at $c$ exactly when $\omega_{t}(c) = 0$, that is exactly when $t(c) = 0$, that is exactly when $c$ is irrational. So the continuity set of $t$ is $\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$ and its discontinuity set is $\mathbb{Q}$. [step 7.1, A1, L5] ∎

## Remarks

- **What claim 2 adds beyond claim 3.** Continuity at a point is the vanishing of the oscillation there, so claim 3 is the special case of claim 2 recording where the value is $0$. The value itself is used on the companion page, where the oscillation of $t$ is computed at particular points, and it shows that the failure of continuity at a rational is exactly as large as the value of $t$ there: small denominators are the bad points.

- **The continuity set of $t$ is $G_\delta$, as it must be.** The irrationals form a $G_\delta$ set ([[cor-q-is-meager-and-not-g-delta]]), in agreement with [[thm-discontinuity-set-is-f-sigma]]. The reverse arrangement is impossible: no function is continuous at every rational and discontinuous at every irrational, because $\mathbb{Q}$ is not $G_\delta$ ([[cor-no-function-is-continuous-exactly-on-q]]).

- **No choice principle is spent.** The separation estimate of step 1.2 is written down from $\lfloor \iota(q)c \rfloor$, the minimum of step 2.1 is the minimum of an explicitly listed finite set, and the least denominator $q(x)$ is a least element. Density supplies points, and it is used only in the form "every neighbourhood meets the set", never to build a sequence.

## Statement

Let $a < b$ be reals, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded
([[def-bounded-set]]) and let

$$D \;:=\; \{\, x \in [a,b] \ : \ f \text{ is discontinuous at } x \,\}$$

([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-classification-of-discontinuities]]). Then

$$f \text{ is Riemann integrable on } [a,b] \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad D \text{ has measure zero}$$

([[def-darboux-integral]], [[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

**The choice cost, named.** The implication from integrability to $D$ being null
uses the Axiom of Countable Choice ([[def-countable-choice]]) exactly once,
through [[thm-countable-union-of-null-is-null]] at step 7.1: $D$ is exhibited as
the union of a sequence of null sets. The converse implication, from $D$ null to
integrability, is a theorem of ZF: it uses no choice principle at all.

**"Measure zero" here is the cover condition of
[[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]**, namely that for every $\varepsilon > 0$
there is a sequence of intervals covering $D$ of total length at most
$\varepsilon$. No outer measure, no measurable set and no Lebesgue integral is
used or needed; the criterion is a statement about interval covers throughout.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, a bounded $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $M_{+} > 0$ with $|f(x)| \le M_{+}$ for every $x \in [a,b]$, and $D$ as in the Statement.

[A1] The Axiom of Countable Choice, used only where [L11] is invoked ([[def-countable-choice]]).

[L1] For a partition $P = (n,t)$ of $[a,b]$: $n \ge 1$, $\Delta_i = t_{i+1}-t_i > 0$, $\sum_{i<n}\Delta_i = b-a$, $I_i = [t_i,t_{i+1}] \subseteq [a,b]$, and appending a point $y > t_n$ to a partition of $[a,t_n]$ gives a partition of $[a,y]$ whose subintervals are the old ones together with $[t_n,y]$ ([[def-partition-and-refinement]]).

[L2] $U(f,P) - L(f,P) = \sum_{i<n}(M_i-m_i)\Delta_i$, $M_i - m_i = \omega_f(I_i)$, and $0 \le M_i - m_i \le 2M_{+}$ ([[def-darboux-sums]], [[def-oscillation]]).

[L3] Riemann's criterion: a bounded $f$ is integrable if and only if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a partition $P$ with $U(f,P)-L(f,P) < \varepsilon$ ([[thm-riemann-criterion]]).

[L4] Oscillation: $\omega_f(S) \le \omega_f(T)$ for $S \subseteq T \subseteq [a,b]$; $0 \le \omega_f(x) \le \omega_f([a,b] \cap N_\rho(x))$ for every real $\rho > 0$ and every $x \in [a,b]$; $\omega_f(x)$ is the infimum of those values over $\rho > 0$; and since $f$ is bounded every one of these values is a real number in $[0, 2M_{+}]$ ([[def-oscillation]], [[def-extended-reals]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L5] $f$ is continuous at $x \in [a,b]$ if and only if $\omega_f(x) = 0$; hence $D = \{x \in [a,b] : \omega_f(x) > 0\}$ ([[thm-continuity-iff-oscillation-zero]], [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L6] For every real $\sigma > 0$ there is a closed $G \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ with $\{x \in [a,b] : \omega_f(x) \ge \sigma\} = [a,b] \cap G$ ([[lem-oscillation-superlevel-sets-are-closed]]).

[L7] A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is compact exactly when it is closed and bounded; $[a,b]$ is closed and bounded; an intersection of closed sets is closed; every open interval is an open set ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], [[def-interval]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L8] $A$ has content zero when for every real $\tau > 0$ there are $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and reals $c_0 \le e_0, \dots, c_m \le e_m$ with $A \subseteq \bigcup_{j \le m}[c_j,e_j]$ and $\sum_{j \le m}(e_j - c_j) \le \tau$; $A$ has measure zero when the same holds with a sequence of intervals and every partial total length at most $\tau$; a subset of a null set is null ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

[L9] A set of content zero has measure zero ([[lem-content-zero-implies-null]]), and for a **compact** set the two notions coincide ([[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]]).

[L10] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $k \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(k) < \eta$; $\iota(k) > 0$ for $k \ge 1$, $\iota$ is nonnegative and nondecreasing on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L11] Assuming [A1], the union of a sequence of null subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ is null ([[thm-countable-union-of-null-is-null]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L12] Finite sums: splitting, additivity, scaling, monotonicity in the terms, and telescoping ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]). Also the interchange of two finite sums, $\sum_{i<n}\sum_{j<p}c_{i,j} = \sum_{j<p}\sum_{i<n}c_{i,j}$ for any doubly indexed family of reals; below it is applied with $p := m+1$, since $\sum_{j \le m}$ abbreviates $\sum_{j<m+1}$. That identity is **not** one of the six clauses of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] and is therefore proved here, by induction on $p$ with $n$ held fixed ([[thm-induction-principle]]). At $p = 0$ each inner sum $\sum_{j<0}c_{i,j}$ is $0$ by the recursion clause of [[def-finite-sum]], so the left side is $\sum_{i<n}0 = 0$ by clause 2 of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] taken with $\lambda = 0$, while the right side is an empty sum and so is $0$ as well. Passing from $p$ to $p+1$, the recursion clause and clause 1 of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] give $\sum_{i<n}\sum_{j<p+1}c_{i,j} = \sum_{i<n}\bigl(\sum_{j<p}c_{i,j} + c_{i,p}\bigr) = \sum_{i<n}\sum_{j<p}c_{i,j} + \sum_{i<n}c_{i,p}$, which by the induction hypothesis is $\sum_{j<p}\sum_{i<n}c_{i,j} + \sum_{i<n}c_{i,p} = \sum_{j<p+1}\sum_{i<n}c_{i,j}$, again by the recursion clause.

[L13] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]); every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ bounded above has a supremum ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L14] Ordered-field arithmetic and the absolute value: adding a constant and multiplying by a positive quantity preserve an inequality; the order is total and transitive; an open interval is order-convex ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-interval]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For a real $\sigma > 0$ put $E_\sigma := \{\, x \in [a,b] : \omega_f(x) \ge \sigma \,\}$. By [L5], $E_\sigma \subseteq D$ for every $\sigma > 0$. [L4, L5, construct]

2.1 **Each $E_\sigma$ has content zero, assuming $f$ integrable.** Let $\sigma > 0$ and $\tau > 0$ be real. By [L3] fix a partition $P = (n,t)$ with $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \sigma\tau \cdot 2^{-1}$. Let $B := \{\, i < n : (t_i,t_{i+1}) \cap E_\sigma \ne \varnothing \,\}$ and put $\chi_i := 1$ for $i \in B$ and $\chi_i := 0$ otherwise. [step 1.1, L3, L14, choose, construct]

2.2 **The exhaustion of $D$.** Put $\sigma_k := 1/\iota(k+1)$ for $k \in \mathbb{N}$, a positive real by [L10]. Then $D = \bigcup_{k \in \mathbb{N}} E_{\sigma_k}$. For the inclusion from left to right, let $x \in D$, so $\omega_f(x) > 0$ by [L5] and $\omega_f(x)$ is a real by [L4]; if $\omega_f(x) \ge 1 = \sigma_0$ then $x \in E_{\sigma_0}$, and otherwise [L10] gives a natural $k+1 \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(k+1) < \omega_f(x)$, so $x \in E_{\sigma_k}$. For the reverse inclusion, $x \in E_{\sigma_k}$ gives $\omega_f(x) \ge \sigma_k > 0$, hence $x \in D$ by [L5]. [step 1.1, L4, L5, L10, L14]

2.3 **The converse; this half of the proof is steps 2.3, 3.2, 4.2, 5.2, 6.2, 7.2, 8.1, 9.1, 10.1, 11.1, 12.1 and 13.1, and its symbols are its own.** Assume $D$ null and let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. Put $\sigma' := \varepsilon \cdot \bigl(2(b-a)\bigr)^{-1}$ and $\tau' := \varepsilon \cdot \bigl(8M_{+}\bigr)^{-1}$, both positive by [L14]. By step 1.1 and [L8], $E_{\sigma'} \subseteq D$ is null. [step 1.1, given, L8, L14]

3.1 For $i \in B$ one has $M_i - m_i \ge \sigma$: fix $x \in (t_i,t_{i+1}) \cap E_\sigma$; since $(t_i,t_{i+1})$ is open there is a real $\rho > 0$ with $N_\rho(x) \subseteq (t_i,t_{i+1})$, so $[a,b] \cap N_\rho(x) \subseteq I_i$ and [L4] gives $\sigma \le \omega_f(x) \le \omega_f([a,b] \cap N_\rho(x)) \le \omega_f(I_i) = M_i - m_i$ by [L2]. [step 2.1, L1, L2, L4, L7, choose]

3.2 $E_{\sigma'}$ is compact: by [L6] there is a closed $G$ with $E_{\sigma'} = [a,b] \cap G$, an intersection of two closed sets, hence closed; and $E_{\sigma'} \subseteq [a,b]$ is bounded. So [L7] applies. [step 2.3, L6, L7]

4.1 Hence $\sigma\chi_i\Delta_i \le (M_i - m_i)\Delta_i$ for every $i < n$, the case $i \notin B$ because both $M_i - m_i \ge 0$ and $\Delta_i > 0$. Summing and using [L12] and [L2]: $\sigma \sum_{i<n}\chi_i\Delta_i \le U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \sigma\tau \cdot 2^{-1}$, so $\lambda := \sum_{i<n}\chi_i\Delta_i < \tau \cdot 2^{-1}$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L2, L12, L14]

4.2 By [L9] applied to the compact null set $E_{\sigma'}$, it has content zero, so by [L8] there are $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and reals $c_0 \le e_0, \dots, c_m \le e_m$ with $E_{\sigma'} \subseteq \bigcup_{j \le m}[c_j,e_j]$ and $\sum_{j\le m}(e_j-c_j) \le \tau' \cdot 2^{-1}$. Put $\mu := \tau' \cdot \bigl(4(\iota(m)+1)\bigr)^{-1} > 0$ and $O_j := (c_j - \mu,\ e_j + \mu)$, an open interval containing $[c_j,e_j]$, of length $(e_j - c_j) + 2\mu$. Then $\sum_{j\le m}\bigl((e_j-c_j)+2\mu\bigr) \le \tau' \cdot 2^{-1} + 2\mu(\iota(m)+1) = \tau' \cdot 2^{-1} + \tau' \cdot 2^{-1} = \tau'$, by [L12] and [L10]. [step 2.3, step 3.2, L8, L9, L10, L12, L14, construct]

5.1 $E_\sigma$ is covered by the finite list of $2n+1$ closed intervals $[p_j,q_j]$, $j \le 2n$, defined by $[p_j,q_j] := [t_j,t_{j+1}]$ for $j < n$ with $j \in B$, $[p_j,q_j] := [a,a]$ for $j < n$ with $j \notin B$, and $[p_j,q_j] := [t_{j-n},t_{j-n}]$ for $n \le j \le 2n$: indeed a point of $E_\sigma$ lies in $[a,b]$, hence is one of $t_0,\dots,t_n$ or lies in some $(t_i,t_{i+1})$, and in the latter case $i \in B$. Its total length is $\sum_{j \le 2n}(q_j - p_j) = \sum_{i<n}\chi_i\Delta_i + 0 = \lambda < \tau$, by splitting the sum at $n$ ([L12]). [step 2.1, step 4.1, L1, L12, L14, construct]

5.2 **The family of good intervals.** Let $\mathcal{W}$ be the set of all open intervals $(u,v)$ with $u < v$ such that either $(u,v) \subseteq O_j$ for some $j \le m$, or $\omega_f([a,b]\cap(u,v)) < \sigma'$. Every $x \in [a,b]$ lies in a member: if $x \in E_{\sigma'}$ then $x \in [c_j,e_j] \subseteq O_j$ for some $j \le m$ by step 4.2, and $O_j$ is itself a member; and if $x \notin E_{\sigma'}$ then $\omega_f(x) < \sigma'$, so by [L4] some real $\rho > 0$ has $\omega_f([a,b]\cap N_\rho(x)) < \sigma'$, and $N_\rho(x) = (x-\rho,x+\rho)$ is a member containing $x$. [step 4.2, L4, L7, L14, construct]

6.1 As $\tau > 0$ was arbitrary, $E_\sigma$ has content zero by [L8], hence measure zero by [L9]; this used only that $f$ is integrable. [step 2.1, step 5.1, L8, L9]

6.2 **Cousin's construction: a partition each of whose subintervals lies in a member of $\mathcal{W}$.** Let $S$ be the set of $y \in (a,b]$ such that some partition of $[a,y]$ has every subinterval contained in a member of $\mathcal{W}$. $S$ is nonempty: by step 5.2 fix $(\alpha,\beta) \in \mathcal{W}$ with $a \in (\alpha,\beta)$ and put $y_0 := \min\{(a+b)\cdot 2^{-1},\ (a+\beta)\cdot 2^{-1}\}$, so $a < y_0 \le b$, $y_0 < \beta$ and $\alpha < a$; the one-subinterval partition of $[a,y_0]$ has $[a,y_0] \subseteq (\alpha,\beta)$, so $y_0 \in S$. Also $S$ is bounded above by $b$, so $s := \sup S$ exists by [L13] and $a < y_0 \le s \le b$. [step 5.2, L1, L13, L14, choose]

7.1 **Integrability implies $D$ null.** Assume $f$ integrable. By step 6.1 each $E_{\sigma_k}$ is null, and $k \mapsto E_{\sigma_k}$ is a sequence of subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, so [L11] applies and $\bigcup_k E_{\sigma_k} = D$ is null by step 2.2. This is the only use of [A1] in the proof. [step 6.1, step 2.2, A1, L11]

7.2 $s = b$. By step 5.2 fix $(\alpha',\beta') \in \mathcal{W}$ with $s \in (\alpha',\beta')$. Since $\sup S = s > \alpha'$ there is $x \in S$ with $x > \alpha'$, and $x \le s$. Suppose $s < b$ and choose a real $y$ with $s < y < \min\{b, \beta'\}$, possible because $s < b$ and $s < \beta'$. Then $\alpha' < x \le s < y < \beta'$, so $[x,y] \subseteq (\alpha',\beta')$, and appending $y$ to a partition of $[a,x]$ witnessing $x \in S$ gives one for $[a,y]$ by [L1]; hence $y \in S$ with $y > \sup S$, which is impossible. [step 6.2, L1, L13, L14, choose]

8.1 $b \in S$. By step 5.2 fix $(\alpha'',\beta'') \in \mathcal{W}$ with $b \in (\alpha'',\beta'')$. Since $\sup S = b > \alpha''$ there is $x \in S$ with $x > \alpha''$ and $x \le b$. If $x = b$ there is nothing to prove; otherwise $\alpha'' < x < b < \beta''$ gives $[x,b] \subseteq (\alpha'',\beta'')$, and appending $b$ as in step 7.2 puts $b$ in $S$. So there is a partition $P' = (n',t')$ of $[a,b]$, with subintervals $I'_i$ and lengths $\Delta'_i$ for $i < n'$, every subinterval of which lies in a member of $\mathcal{W}$. [step 5.2, step 7.2, L1, L13, L14, choose]

9.1 **Good and bad subintervals.** Write $M'_i := \sup f[I'_i]$ and $m'_i := \inf f[I'_i]$. Call $i < n'$ **good** when $I'_i \subseteq W$ for some $W = (u,v) \in \mathcal{W}$ with $\omega_f([a,b]\cap(u,v)) < \sigma'$, and **bad** otherwise. For a good $i$, $I'_i \subseteq [a,b] \cap W$, so $M'_i - m'_i = \omega_f(I'_i) \le \omega_f([a,b]\cap W) < \sigma'$ by [L2] and [L4]. For a bad $i$, step 8.1 supplies a member containing $I'_i$, and it is not of the second kind, so $I'_i \subseteq O_j$ for some $j \le m$. [step 8.1, L1, L2, L4]

10.1 **Bounding the bad lengths.** For $j \le m$ put $J_j := \{\, i < n' : c_j - \mu \le t'_i \text{ and } t'_{i+1} \le e_j + \mu \,\}$ and $h^{j}_i := \Delta'_i$ for $i \in J_j$, $h^{j}_i := 0$ otherwise; a bad $i$ lies in some $J_j$ by step 9.1. Each $J_j$ consists of consecutive indices, since $i < i^{\dagger} < i^{\ddagger}$ with $i,i^{\ddagger} \in J_j$ gives $c_j - \mu \le t'_i \le t'_{i^{\dagger}}$ and $t'_{i^{\dagger}+1} \le t'_{i^{\ddagger}+1} \le e_j + \mu$. [step 9.1, L1, L14, construct]

11.1 $\sum_{i<n'}h^{j}_i \le (e_j - c_j) + 2\mu$ for each $j \le m$: the sum is $0$ when $J_j = \varnothing$; otherwise let $p := \min J_j$ and let $q$ be the least natural with $q > p$ and $q \notin J_j$, which exists by [L13] since $n' \notin J_j$, so that $J_j = \{\, i : p \le i < q \,\}$ by step 10.1. Splitting the sum at $p$ and at $q$ and discarding the vanishing outer parts, then telescoping ([L12]), gives $\sum_{i<n'}h^{j}_i = \sum_{i=p}^{q-1}\Delta'_i = t'_q - t'_p \le (e_j+\mu) - (c_j-\mu)$, using $p \in J_j$ and $q-1 \in J_j$. [step 10.1, L12, L13, L14]

12.1 Put $\beta_i := \Delta'_i$ for bad $i$ and $\beta_i := 0$ for good $i$. Then $\beta_i \le \sum_{j \le m}h^{j}_i$ pointwise by step 10.1, all terms being nonnegative, so by [L12] and step 11.1, $\sum_{i<n'}\beta_i \le \sum_{j\le m}\sum_{i<n'}h^{j}_i \le \sum_{j\le m}\bigl((e_j-c_j)+2\mu\bigr) \le \tau'$, the last step by step 4.2. [step 4.2, step 10.1, step 11.1, L12, L14]

13.1 For every $i < n'$, $(M'_i-m'_i)\Delta'_i \le \sigma'\Delta'_i + 2M_{+}\beta_i$: for good $i$ by step 9.1 and $\beta_i \ge 0$, for bad $i$ by $M'_i - m'_i \le 2M_{+}$ from [L2] and $\beta_i = \Delta'_i$. Summing over $i < n'$ and using [L12], [L1] and step 12.1: $U(f,P')-L(f,P') \le \sigma'(b-a) + 2M_{+}\tau' = \varepsilon\cdot 2^{-1} + \varepsilon \cdot 4^{-1} < \varepsilon$. [step 2.3, step 9.1, step 12.1, L1, L2, L12, L14]

14.1 The real $\varepsilon > 0$ of step 2.3 was arbitrary and step 13.1 produced a partition with $U - L < \varepsilon$, so $f$ is integrable by [L3]. With step 7.1 this proves both implications, and the criterion is established; the forward half is steps 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1, 6.1 and 7.1, working with $\sigma, \tau, P, B, \chi, \lambda$, and the converse half is the steps named in step 2.3, working with $\sigma', \tau', P', \mathcal{W}, S$. [step 7.1, step 2.3, step 13.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the two halves cost.** The forward half is a single application of Riemann's criterion for each threshold $\sigma$, plus the countable union; the backward half is where all the work is, and it is entirely a covering argument: the bad set is compact and null, hence of content zero, hence coverable by finitely many open intervals of small total length, and the rest of $[a,b]$ is chopped up by Cousin's construction into pieces of oscillation below $\sigma$.

- **Why Cousin's construction and not a Lebesgue number.** Step 6.2 to step 8.1 build the partition directly from the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$: the set of right endpoints reachable by a good partition is nonempty and bounded, and its supremum is shown to be $b$ and to be attained. This uses no sequence, no subsequence and no choice, whereas the usual Lebesgue-number argument selects a bad interval for each $n$ and then extracts a convergent subsequence, which costs countable choice. Since the whole point of this item's choice ledger is that the backward implication is a ZF theorem, the choice-free route is the one taken.

- **The superlevel sets, not the discontinuity set, are what is covered.** $D$ itself is in general not closed, so [[thm-compact-null-is-content-zero]] does not apply to it; each $E_\sigma$ **is** closed in $[a,b]$ ([[lem-oscillation-superlevel-sets-are-closed]]) and bounded, and that is exactly the hypothesis needed. The passage back from the $E_{\sigma_k}$ to $D$ is step 2.2, and it is where the countable union appears.

- **The exhaustion $D = \bigcup_k E_{1/\iota(k+1)}$ is derived here, and it is also claim 1 of [[thm-discontinuity-set-is-f-sigma]].** When this proof was written that theorem stated only the descriptive form — $D$ as the trace on the domain of an $F_\sigma$ subset of $\mathbb{R}$ — which is not the pointwise identity step 2.2 needs, so the identity was derived inline from [[thm-continuity-iff-oscillation-zero]] and the Archimedean property. The exhaustion has since been stated there as claim 1, precisely because several items were quoting it from a theorem that did not assert it. The inline derivation is retained because it is three lines and keeps this item's choice ledger readable in one place; citing claim 1 instead would be equally correct.

- **Both directions are sharp in the obvious sense.** The indicator of the Cantor set is discontinuous on an uncountable null set and is integrable; the indicator of the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set is discontinuous on a nowhere dense set that is not null and is not integrable ([[fs-integrability-is-equivalent-to-a-nowhere-dense-discontinuity-set]]). So neither cardinality nor category decides integrability; only measure does.
