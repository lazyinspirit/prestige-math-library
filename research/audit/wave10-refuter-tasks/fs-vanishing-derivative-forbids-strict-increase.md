## Statement

**False claim:** let $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be an interval
([[def-interval]]), let $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in I$ be a point at
which $f$ is differentiable with

$$f'(c) \;=\; 0$$

([[def-derivative]]). Then $f$ is **not** increasing on $I$, in the strict sense
of [[def-monotone-function]].

**Why it is tempting.** [[thm-monotonicity-from-the-derivative]] proves that
$f' > 0$ at every interior point gives an increasing function, and one reads the
implication backwards: if strict increase comes from a strictly positive
derivative, surely a derivative that fails to be strictly positive somewhere
must destroy the strict increase there. It does not. Claim 5 of that theorem is
the true converse, and it is non-strict: an increasing $f$ has $f' \ge 0$
wherever it is differentiable, and nothing forbids equality at isolated points.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The interval $I := \mathbb{R}$, the point $c := 0$ and the function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, $f(x) := x^{3}$ ([[def-integer-power]], [[def-interval]]).

[L1] Power rule ([[lem-derivative-of-a-power]], claim 2): for a natural $n \ge 1$ the function $x \mapsto x^{n}$ is differentiable at every real $c$ with derivative $\iota(n)c^{\,n-1}$.

[L2] Canonical naturals ([[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]): $\iota(n) > 0$ for every natural $n \ge 1$, so in particular $\iota(3) > 0$.

[L3] Powers ([[def-integer-power]]): $a^{0} = 1$, $a^{2} = a \cdot a$, and $0 \cdot a = 0$, so $0^{2} = 0$.

[L4] Order arithmetic ([[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]]): a product of two positive reals is positive and a product of two negative reals is positive; the order is total and transitive, and trichotomy holds.

[L5] Monotonicity from the derivative ([[thm-monotonicity-from-the-derivative]], claim 2): for $J$ order-convex and $h : J \to \mathbb{R}$ continuous on $J$ and differentiable at every interior point of $J$ with $h' > 0$ there, $h$ is increasing on $J$.

[L6] Continuity ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], claim 5): $x \mapsto x^{n}$ is continuous at every point of its domain for every natural $n$; and continuity passes to a subset of the domain ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L7] Restriction of the derivative ([[def-derivative]]): if $B \subseteq A$, if $p \in B$ is a limit point of $B$ and if $h : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is differentiable at $p$, then $h|_B$ is differentiable at $p$ with the same derivative; every point of an order-convex set with at least two elements is a limit point of it ([[def-limit-point-r]]); and a point $p$ is interior to a set $S$ exactly when $N_{\varepsilon}(p) \subseteq S$ for some real $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]).

[L8] Increasing on a set $J$ means $h(x) < h(y)$ for all $x, y \in J$ with $x < y$ ([[def-monotone-function]]).

[L9] A positive base has positive natural powers ([[lem-power-monotone]], claim 1).

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L1] with $n := 3$, the function $f$ is differentiable at every real $c$ with $f'(c) = \iota(3)\,c^{2}$. In particular $f'(0) = \iota(3) \cdot 0^{2} = \iota(3) \cdot 0 = 0$ by [L3]. [L1, L3]

1.2 For every real $c \ne 0$ one has $c^{2} > 0$: if $c > 0$ this is [L9]; if $c < 0$ then $c^{2} = c \cdot c$ is a product of two negative reals, hence positive by [L3] and [L4]. Therefore $f'(c) = \iota(3)c^{2} > 0$ for every $c \ne 0$, being a product of two positive reals by [L2] and [L4]. [L2, L3, L4, L9]

1.3 Put $I_1 := (-\infty, 0]$ and $I_2 := [0,\infty)$, both order-convex with at least two elements ([[def-interval]]). Every real $x < 0$ is interior to $I_1$, since $N_{|x|}(x) \subseteq (-\infty,0) \subseteq I_1$; and $0$ is **not** interior to $I_1$, since every $N_{\varepsilon}(0)$ contains $\varepsilon/2 > 0$, which is not in $I_1$. As every interior point of $I_1$ lies in $I_1$ and so satisfies $x \le 0$, the interior points of $I_1$ are exactly the reals $x < 0$. The same argument gives that the interior points of $I_2$ are exactly the reals $x > 0$. [L4, L7]

2.1 By [L6] the function $f$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R}$, hence $f|_{I_1}$ is continuous on $I_1$ and $f|_{I_2}$ is continuous on $I_2$. At every interior point $x$ of $I_1$ one has $x < 0$ by step 1.3, so $x$ is a limit point of $I_1$ by [L7] and $f|_{I_1}$ is differentiable at $x$ with derivative $f'(x) = \iota(3)x^{2} > 0$ by step 1.2 and [L7]. So [L5] gives that $f|_{I_1}$ is increasing on $I_1$; the same argument on $I_2$ gives that $f|_{I_2}$ is increasing on $I_2$. [step 1.2, step 1.3, L5, L6, L7]

3.1 Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$. If $b \le 0$ then $a, b \in I_1$ and step 2.1 gives $f(a) < f(b)$. If $a \ge 0$ then $a, b \in I_2$ and step 2.1 gives $f(a) < f(b)$. Otherwise $b > 0$ and $a < 0$, so $a, 0 \in I_1$ with $a < 0$ gives $f(a) < f(0)$, while $0, b \in I_2$ with $0 < b$ gives $f(0) < f(b)$, and transitivity gives $f(a) < f(b)$. The three cases are exhaustive, since failing both $b \le 0$ and $a \ge 0$ means $b > 0$ and $a < 0$. So $f$ is increasing on $\mathbb{R}$ by [L8]. [step 2.1, L4, L8]

4.1 The false claim fails on this witness: $\mathbb{R}$ is an interval, $f$ is differentiable at $c = 0$ with $f'(0) = 0$ by step 1.1, and yet $f$ is increasing on $\mathbb{R}$ by step 3.1. So a vanishing derivative forbids nothing of the kind, and the claim is false. [step 1.1, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **What survives.** Claim 5 of [[thm-monotonicity-from-the-derivative]] is the correct converse and is non-strict: an increasing function differentiable at a point of its interval has $f' \ge 0$ there. This witness saturates that inequality at exactly one point, and no more can be said in general.

- **How large the vanishing set can be is not settled here.** The witness has $f' = 0$ at a single point. Nothing on this page says how big the set $\{ f' = 0 \}$ may be for an increasing $f$, and nothing here should be read as suggesting that it must be small.

- **The same function is the standard witness for a second false reading**, that a vanishing derivative marks a local extremum: $f$ has neither a local maximum nor a local minimum at $0$, precisely because it is increasing. [[ex-x-cubed-is-strictly-increasing-with-a-vanishing-derivative]] on the companion page computes the derivative in full and draws the further consequence, through [[thm-derivative-of-an-inverse]], that the inverse of this function is not differentiable at $0$.

So allowing $x = c$ costs nothing, and it is what lets the definition\nbe stated at every point of $A$, including the points where no limit exists.\n\n**Three clauses, and all three are part of the definition.**\n\n1. **At a limit point.** Suppose $c \\in A$ is a limit point of $A$\n   ([[def-limit-point-r]]). Then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if the\n   limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and\n   $$\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) \\;=\\; f(c)$$\n   ([[def-function-limit]]).

Then **every** $f : A \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$: take\n   $\\delta := \\eta$, so that the only $x \\in A$ with $|x - c| < \\delta$ is $c$\n   itself, and $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \\varepsilon$.\n\n3. **On a set.** Continuity on $A$ is continuity at each point of $A$, and\n   nothing more. It is not a condition relating $f$ to points outside $A$.\n\nEvery point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$,\nand never both ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so clauses 1 and 2 between them describe\ncontinuity at every point of $A$.\n\n**This is not the raw $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ formula of\n[[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]].** That item records what goes\nwrong when the *punctured* formula of [[def-function-limit]] is written down at\nan arbitrary point of the domain: at an isolated point it is satisfied\nvacuously by every real $L$ at once, so it defines nothing, and this library\ntherefore leaves $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x)$ **undefined** at an isolated point.\nContinuity at an isolated point is a different matter: the formula above is not\nvacuous — it is a genuine condition on $f(c)$, satisfied because $f(c)$ is the\nonly value being compared with itself — and it names a single, well-defined\nproperty. The limit is undefined there; the continuity is defined, and is\nautomatic. Clause 1 is the only place where the two notions meet, and it is\nstated only where the limit exists as a notion.\n\n**Where the distinction disappears.** If $A$ is an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}$\n([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), then every $c \\in A$ has some\n$N_{\\eta}(c) \\subseteq A$, and a punctured neighbourhood is never empty\n([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), so every point of $A$ is a limit point of $A$ and\nclause 1 covers the whole of $A$. The same holds when $A$ is a nondegenerate\ninterval ([[def-interval]]).

Two reals both meeting the condition are therefore equal, and the\n   symbol denotes.\n2. **Meaningfulness.** The hypothesis that $c$ is a limit point of $A$ is not\n   decoration. At an **isolated** point of $A$ the punctured condition\n   $0 < |x - c| < \\delta$ is met by no point of the domain at all, so the\n   $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ formula is satisfied vacuously by *every* real at\n   once; this is why [[def-function-limit]] leaves the limit undefined there,\n   and it is why this library defines $f'(c)$ only at a limit point of $A$. At\n   an isolated point of its domain a function is neither differentiable nor\n   non-differentiable here: the question is not posed.\n\n**The limit sees only $A \\setminus \\{c\\}$, so how the difference quotient is\nextended to $c$ is irrelevant.** Let $Q : A \\to \\mathbb{R}$ agree with\n$q_{f,c}$ at every point of $A \\setminus \\{c\\}$, and let $L \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nThen $\\lim_{x \\to c} Q(x) = L$ if and only if $\\lim_{x \\to c} q_{f,c}(x) = L$.\nBoth conditions read: for every real $\\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real\n$\\delta > 0$ such that every point $x$ of the relevant domain with\n$0 < |x - c| < \\delta$ satisfies $|{\\cdot} - L| < \\varepsilon$\n([[def-function-limit]]). The clause $0 < |x - c|$ removes $x = c$ from both\nquantifiers, so in both cases the points quantified over are exactly the\n$x \\in A \\setminus \\{c\\}$ with $0 < |x - c| < \\delta$, at which $Q$ and\n$q_{f,c}$ take the same value. The two conditions are the same condition.\n\n**Differentiability on a set.** For $S \\subseteq A$, $f$ is **differentiable on\n$S$** when it is differentiable at every $c \\in S$; implicit in that phrase is\nthat every point of $S$ is a limit point of $A$. $f$ is **differentiable** when\nit is differentiable on the whole of $A$.\n\n**Restriction of the domain.** Let $B \\subseteq A$, let $c \\in B$ and suppose\n$c$ is a limit point of $B$. If $f$ is differentiable at $c$, then so is the\nrestriction $f|_B : B \\to \\mathbb{R}$, and\n\n$$(f|_B)'(c) \\;=\\; f'(c) .$$\n\nIndeed $B \\setminus \\{c\\} \\subseteq A \\setminus \\{c\\}$; the displayed identity\nof punctured neighbourhoods above, applied to $B$, shows that $c$ is a limit\npoint of $B \\setminus \\{c\\}$; the difference quotient $q_{f|_B, c}$ is the\nrestriction of $q_{f,c}$ to $B \\setminus \\{c\\}$, since $f|_B(c) = f(c)$; and\nclaim 2 of [[lem-limit-is-local]] carries the limit to that restriction.\n\n**Every point of a nondegenerate interval is a limit point of it.** Let\n$J \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ be order-convex ([[def-interval]]) with at least two\nelements and let $p \\in J$.

## Definition

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]) with additive identity $0_F$ and
multiplicative identity $1_F$. Define
$\iota : \mathbb{N} \to F$ by recursion on $\mathbb{N}$
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[thm-recursion]]):

$$\iota(0) \;:=\; 0_F, \qquad \iota(n+1) \;:=\; \iota(n) + 1_F .$$

$\iota(n)$ is the **canonical natural** of $n$ in $F$. It is also written
$n \cdot 1_F$, and for $n \ge 1$ it is $1_F$ added to itself $n$ times.

**Why the notation is needed at all.** A natural number in this library is a von
Neumann natural, that is a set ([[def-natural-numbers]]), and a set is not an
element of $F$. So $1/n$, $n^{\alpha}$ and $x/n$ are not expressions of $F$ when
$n$ is a natural: what they mean is $1/\iota(n)$, $\iota(n)^{\alpha}$ and
$x/\iota(n)$. The map $\iota$ is what carries a counting number into the field,
and writing it is the whole reason a reader meets $1/\iota(k+1)$ where an
informal text would write $1/(k+1)$.

## Remarks

- **Where the index shift comes from.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
  ([[def-natural-numbers]]) and $\iota(0) = 0_F$, so $1/\iota(k)$ is undefined at
  $k = 0$. A family of reciprocals indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ is therefore written
  over $\iota(k+1)$, which is why the harmonic and telescoping families of this
  library run over $k+1$ rather than over $k$. This is bookkeeping, not a
  restriction: the values are the usual ones.

- **This definition records notation; the arithmetic is proved elsewhere.** That
  $\iota$ is strictly increasing and positive on $n \ge 1$, and that it carries
  sums to sums and products to products, is [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], stated
  for an ordered field. That lemma introduces the same element by the equivalent
  recursion $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, which
  agrees with the definition above because $\iota(1) = \iota(0) + 1_F = 1_F$.
  Nothing here is new mathematics; the definition exists so that the notation has
  a home a reader can look up.

- **The symbol $\iota$ is used in this library for other canonical maps, and this
  definition does not govern them.** It also denotes the canonical field
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to F$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), the isometric
  embedding of a metric space into a completion ([[def-metric-completion]]), and
  an inclusion map $\iota : S \to X$ of a subspace. Each of those is introduced
  where it is used and means something different from the map defined here. What
  the four share is only that each is the canonical map of its situation.

- **Fields, not just ordered fields.** The recursion needs no order, so the
  definition is stated for a field; every use in this library is in an ordered
  field, and the order is what makes $\iota$ injective
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). In a field of positive characteristic $\iota$
  is not injective, which is one reason the injectivity is a lemma rather than
  part of the definition.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field with its order and
absolute value ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]), and
neighbourhoods are those of [[def-neighbourhood-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Then
$f$ is **continuous at $c$** when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

with $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ ranging over the **positive reals**. In the
language of neighbourhoods: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ with

$$f\bigl(A \cap N_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \;\subseteq\; N_{\varepsilon}\bigl(f(c)\bigr).$$

$f$ is **continuous on $A$** when it is continuous at every point of $A$.

**The point $c$ is required to lie in $A$, and the condition is unpunctured.**
Both differ from [[def-function-limit]], and deliberately. There the quantifier
runs over $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, which removes $x = c$; here $x = c$ is allowed,
and at $x = c$ the implication reads $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$, which is
automatic. So allowing $x = c$ costs nothing, and it is what lets the definition
be stated at every point of $A$, including the points where no limit exists.

**Three clauses, and all three are part of the definition.**

1. **At a limit point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is a limit point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]). Then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if the
   limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) \;=\; f(c)$$
   ([[def-function-limit]]). Indeed, for a given $\varepsilon > 0$ a $\delta$
   witnessing continuity witnesses the limit condition, because the limit
   condition quantifies over a subset of the points continuity quantifies over;
   and conversely a $\delta$ witnessing $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$ witnesses
   continuity, because the one point it omits, $x = c$, satisfies
   $|f(c) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ anyway.

2. **At an isolated point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is an isolated point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so that $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ for some real
   $\eta > 0$. Then **every** $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$: take
   $\delta := \eta$, so that the only $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ is $c$
   itself, and $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$.

3. **On a set.** Continuity on $A$ is continuity at each point of $A$, and
   nothing more. It is not a condition relating $f$ to points outside $A$.

Every point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$,
and never both ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so clauses 1 and 2 between them describe
continuity at every point of $A$.

**This is not the raw $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula of
[[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]].** That item records what goes
wrong when the *punctured* formula of [[def-function-limit]] is written down at
an arbitrary point of the domain: at an isolated point it is satisfied
vacuously by every real $L$ at once, so it defines nothing, and this library
therefore leaves $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ **undefined** at an isolated point.
Continuity at an isolated point is a different matter: the formula above is not
vacuous — it is a genuine condition on $f(c)$, satisfied because $f(c)$ is the
only value being compared with itself — and it names a single, well-defined
property. The limit is undefined there; the continuity is defined, and is
automatic. Clause 1 is the only place where the two notions meet, and it is
stated only where the limit exists as a notion.

**Where the distinction disappears.** If $A$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), then every $c \in A$ has some
$N_{\eta}(c) \subseteq A$, and a punctured neighbourhood is never empty
([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), so every point of $A$ is a limit point of $A$ and
clause 1 covers the whole of $A$. The same holds when $A$ is a nondegenerate
interval ([[def-interval]]). Isolated points are what force clause 2 to exist at
all, and they occur as soon as $A$ is allowed to be an arbitrary subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, as in $A = \{0\} \cup [1,2]$.

## Remarks

- **Continuity is local.** If $\eta > 0$ and $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agrees with
  $f$ on $A \cap N_{\eta}(c)$, then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if $g$
  is: any $\delta$ may be replaced by $\min\{\delta, \eta\}$, after which the
  condition only ever evaluates the two functions where they agree. So
  continuity at $c$ sees only an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of $c$, exactly
  as the limit does ([[lem-limit-is-local]]).

- **Continuity passes to subsets of the domain.** If $B \subseteq A$ and
  $c \in B$, then continuity of $f$ at $c$ gives continuity of the restriction
  $f|_B$ at $c$, with the same $\delta$: the condition on $f|_B$ quantifies over
  fewer points. The converse fails, and the standard witness is the indicator of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ restricted to $\mathbb{Q}$, which is constant and hence
  continuous, while the indicator itself is continuous nowhere
  ([[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]]).

- **The radius is a real number.** As in [[def-neighbourhood-r]], $\varepsilon$
  and $\delta$ range over the positive reals here. Restricting either quantifier
  to the positive rationals defines the same relation, by the passage recorded
  in [[def-function-limit]]: below every positive real lies a positive rational
  ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and a real $\delta$ may be shrunk to a rational
  one below it.

- **The word *continuous* is used for two things in this library, and they
  agree.** [[def-metric-continuity]] defines continuity of a map between metric
  spaces, and $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ carries the metric $d(x,y) = |x-y|$. The
  two notions coincide, and that is proved, not assumed:
  [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]] is the dictionary, and it is stated on
  this page precisely so that no later item has to guess.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), neighbourhoods are those of
[[def-neighbourhood-r]] and limit points those of [[def-limit-point-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$ be a
**limit point of $A$**. The **difference quotient of $f$ at $c$** is the function

$$q_{f,c} : A \setminus \{c\} \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad q_{f,c}(x) := \frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c} .$$

The division is legitimate at every point of the domain, since $x \ne c$ gives
$x - c \ne 0$.

**The point $c$ is a limit point of $A \setminus \{c\}$, not merely of $A$.**
For every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the punctured neighbourhood
$N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c)$ omits $c$, so

$$N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c) \cap A \;=\; N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c) \cap (A \setminus \{c\}) ,$$

and the left-hand side is nonempty because $c$ is a limit point of $A$. So
$q_{f,c}$ is a function on a set having $c$ as a limit point, and
$\lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x)$ is a notion that [[def-function-limit]] defines.

$f$ is **differentiable at $c$** when that limit exists, and then the
**derivative of $f$ at $c$** is

$$f'(c) \;:=\; \lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x) \;=\; \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c} .$$

**Two obligations are carried by that notation, and both are discharged here.**

1. **Uniqueness.** Writing $f'(c)$ treats the right-hand side as a name for a
   single real number. That is legitimate: $c$ is a limit point of the domain
   $A \setminus \{c\}$ of $q_{f,c}$, so at most one real can satisfy the
   $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ condition, by [[lem-function-limit-unique]] applied to
   $q_{f,c}$. Two reals both meeting the condition are therefore equal, and the
   symbol denotes.
2. **Meaningfulness.** The hypothesis that $c$ is a limit point of $A$ is not
   decoration. At an **isolated** point of $A$ the punctured condition
   $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ is met by no point of the domain at all, so the
   $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula is satisfied vacuously by *every* real at
   once; this is why [[def-function-limit]] leaves the limit undefined there,
   and it is why this library defines $f'(c)$ only at a limit point of $A$. At
   an isolated point of its domain a function is neither differentiable nor
   non-differentiable here: the question is not posed.

**The limit sees only $A \setminus \{c\}$, so how the difference quotient is
extended to $c$ is irrelevant.** Let $Q : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agree with
$q_{f,c}$ at every point of $A \setminus \{c\}$, and let $L \in \mathbb{R}$.
Then $\lim_{x \to c} Q(x) = L$ if and only if $\lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x) = L$.
Both conditions read: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ such that every point $x$ of the relevant domain with
$0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|{\cdot} - L| < \varepsilon$
([[def-function-limit]]). The clause $0 < |x - c|$ removes $x = c$ from both
quantifiers, so in both cases the points quantified over are exactly the
$x \in A \setminus \{c\}$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, at which $Q$ and
$q_{f,c}$ take the same value. The two conditions are the same condition.

**Differentiability on a set.** For $S \subseteq A$, $f$ is **differentiable on
$S$** when it is differentiable at every $c \in S$; implicit in that phrase is
that every point of $S$ is a limit point of $A$. $f$ is **differentiable** when
it is differentiable on the whole of $A$.

**Restriction of the domain.** Let $B \subseteq A$, let $c \in B$ and suppose
$c$ is a limit point of $B$. If $f$ is differentiable at $c$, then so is the
restriction $f|_B : B \to \mathbb{R}$, and

$$(f|_B)'(c) \;=\; f'(c) .$$

Indeed $B \setminus \{c\} \subseteq A \setminus \{c\}$; the displayed identity
of punctured neighbourhoods above, applied to $B$, shows that $c$ is a limit
point of $B \setminus \{c\}$; the difference quotient $q_{f|_B, c}$ is the
restriction of $q_{f,c}$ to $B \setminus \{c\}$, since $f|_B(c) = f(c)$; and
claim 2 of [[lem-limit-is-local]] carries the limit to that restriction.

**Every point of a nondegenerate interval is a limit point of it.** Let
$J \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be order-convex ([[def-interval]]) with at least two
elements and let $p \in J$. Choose $q \in J$ with $q \ne p$, and let a real
$\varepsilon > 0$ be given. If $p < q$, put $y := p + \tfrac{1}{2}\min\{\varepsilon,\ q - p\}$;
then $p < y$, and $y - p \le \tfrac{1}{2}(q-p) < q - p$, so $p < y < q$ and
order-convexity gives $y \in J$, while $0 < |y - p| < \varepsilon$. If $q < p$,
the point $y := p - \tfrac{1}{2}\min\{\varepsilon,\ p - q\}$ serves in the same
way. So $N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(p) \cap J \ne \varnothing$ for every real
$\varepsilon > 0$, that is, $p$ is a limit point of $J$
([[def-limit-point-r]]).

Consequently, for $f$ defined on a nondegenerate interval $I$, the symbol
$f'(c)$ is meaningful at **every** $c \in I$, endpoints included. At an endpoint
the difference quotient is taken over the points of $I$ lying on the one side
that is available, so what other texts call a one-sided derivative is, here,
simply the derivative of $f$ on $I$.

## Remarks

- **Notation.** $f'(c)$ and $\frac{df}{dx}(c)$ denote the same real number, and
  this library uses the first. Neither is an operation performed on a symbol
  $x$: the variable in the second is a name for the argument and nothing more.

- **Differentiability is a property of the pair $(f, A)$ at $c$, not of $f$
  alone.** The restriction clause above goes in one direction only, and the
  converse fails. Take $A := \mathbb{R}$, $f(x) := |x|$, $B := [0,\infty)$ and
  $c := 0$. Then $f|_B$ is the identity on $B$, whose difference quotient at $0$
  is constantly $1$, so $f|_B$ is differentiable at $0$ with derivative $1$;
  that $f$ itself is not differentiable at $0$ is
  [[cex-absolute-value-is-not-differentiable-at-zero]] on the companion page.
  So enlarging the domain can destroy differentiability, and the phrase
  "$f$ is differentiable at $c$" always carries the domain with it.

- **The relation to continuity is not definitional.** [[def-continuity-real]]
  is a condition on $f$ near $c$ that does not mention a quotient, and it is
  defined at every point of $A$, isolated points included, whereas
  differentiability is defined only at limit points of $A$. That
  differentiability implies continuity is a theorem on this page and not a
  reading of the definitions.

- **No second derivative and no one-sided derivative is introduced here.**
  Both are standard, and both are absent from this page on purpose;
  [[rem-derivative-conventions]] records exactly what is fixed and what is left
  open at this point in the reading order.

## Definition

Let $a \in \mathbb{R}$, where $\mathbb{R}$ is the ambient ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]).

**Natural exponents.** By the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) applied to
the set $\mathbb{R}$, the starting element $1$ and the function
$f(x) = x \cdot a$, there is a unique function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$,
written $n \mapsto a^n$, with

$$a^0 = 1, \qquad a^{n+1} = a^n \cdot a \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Thus $a^1 = a$, $a^2 = a \cdot a$, and so on. Note that this is defined for
**every** $a$, including $a = 0$.

**Negative exponents.** If $a \ne 0$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, set

$$a^{-n} := (a^n)^{-1}.$$

**Why that is legitimate.** The right-hand side presupposes that $a^n$ is
invertible, that is, that $a^n \ne 0$. This is a proof obligation and not an
observation, and it is discharged by claim 2 of [[lem-power-laws]]: for $a \ne 0$
in a field, $a^n \ne 0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, proved there by induction on
$n$ from the fact that a field has no zero divisors ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]).
That lemma is a statement *about* the operation introduced here, so it depends on
this definition and is recorded in this item's `justified_by` rather than in its
`deps` (SCHEMA §3). Given $a^n \ne 0$, the value $(a^n)^{-1}$ is a single
well-determined element, because multiplicative inverses in a field are unique
([[lem-of-inverse-unique]]).

**Integer exponents.** Every integer $m$ ([[def-integers]]) is either
$\iota(n)$ or $-\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$, where $\iota$ is the
embedding $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]],
[[def-int-operations]]). This too is a citation and not a slogan: the order on
$\mathbb{Z}$ is total ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), so $m \ge 0$ or $m < 0$; the
image of $\iota$ is exactly the set of nonnegative integers, and each of them is
$\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]); and if $m < 0$ then
$-m > 0$, by compatibility of the order with addition ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]),
so $-m = \iota(n)$ and $m = -\iota(n)$, with $n$ unique because $\iota$ is
injective. The two clauses above therefore define $a^m$ for every
$m \in \mathbb{Z}$ whenever $a \ne 0$, and for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$ for
arbitrary $a$. The clauses are consistent where they overlap: the only overlap is
$m = 0$, where $-\iota(0) = \iota(0)$ and $(a^0)^{-1} = 1^{-1} = 1 = a^0$.

## Remarks

- **The convention $0^0 = 1$ is adopted here**, and it is not a matter of taste
  but of agreement with the recursion above: $a^0 = 1$ is the starting value for
  every $a$, exactly as the empty product is $1$ ([[def-finite-sum]]). This is
  the convention that makes the empty product, the binomial theorem, and
  polynomial notation $\sum_k c_k x^k$ work at $x = 0$ without an exception. The
  competing convention "$0^0$ undefined" belongs to contexts where $x^y$ is
  studied as a function of two *real* variables and one wants continuity, which
  is unavailable and irrelevant here: the exponent in $a^m$ is an integer, never
  a real.
- $0^n = 0$ for every $n \ge 1$, since $0^{n} = 0^{n-1} \cdot 0 = 0$, a product
  with a zero factor ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]); and
  $0^{-n}$ is not defined for $n \ge 1$, since $0$ has no inverse.
- The exponent is an integer and stays an integer. Rational exponents are a
  separate construction resting on the existence of roots
  ([[thm-nth-roots-exist]], [[def-rational-power]]), and real exponents do not
  exist in this library yet ([[rem-real-exponents-deferred]]).
- The laws $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$ are
  proved, not assumed, in [[lem-power-laws]]; the order behaviour of $a \mapsto a^n$
  is [[lem-power-monotone]].

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with open and closed sets as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

- The **interior** of $A$ is the union of all open subsets of $A$:
  $$A^{\circ} \;:=\; \bigcup \{\, U \subseteq \mathbb{R} : U \text{ open and } U \subseteq A \,\}.$$
- The **closure** of $A$ is the intersection of all closed supersets of $A$:
  $$\overline{A} \;:=\; \bigcap \{\, F \subseteq \mathbb{R} : F \text{ closed and } A \subseteq F \,\}.$$
- The **boundary** of $A$ is $\partial A := \overline{A} \setminus A^{\circ}$.
- The **exterior** of $A$ is $\operatorname{ext} A := (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)^{\circ}$.

**Both operators are well defined and deliver what their names claim.** The
family whose union defines $A^{\circ}$ always contains $\varnothing$, and the
family whose intersection defines $\overline{A}$ always contains $\mathbb{R}$,
so the second family is nonempty and both expressions denote subsets of
$\mathbb{R}$ without appeal to any convention about empty unions or
intersections. Moreover:

- $A^{\circ}$ is **open**, being a union of open sets
  ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], claim 1), and $A^{\circ} \subseteq A$, since
  every set in the family is a subset of $A$. It is therefore the **largest**
  open subset of $A$: any open $U \subseteq A$ is a member of the family and so
  $U \subseteq A^{\circ}$.
- $\overline{A}$ is **closed**, being an intersection of a nonempty family of
  closed sets ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], claim 3), and $A \subseteq
  \overline{A}$, since every set in the family contains $A$. It is therefore the
  **smallest** closed superset of $A$: any closed $F \supseteq A$ is a member of
  the family and so $\overline{A} \subseteq F$.

**Pointwise description of the interior.** For $x \in \mathbb{R}$,

$$x \in A^{\circ} \iff \text{there is } \varepsilon > 0 \text{ with } N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A .$$

If $x \in A^{\circ}$ then, $A^{\circ}$ being open and containing $x$, there is
$\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A^{\circ} \subseteq A$.
Conversely if $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A$ then $N_\varepsilon(x)$ is an open
subset of $A$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) containing $x$, hence
$x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A^{\circ}$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

The corresponding pointwise description of the closure is not a definitional
matter and is proved separately, as [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

## Remarks

- **The four sets partition nothing by themselves, but three of them do.** For
  every $A$ the three sets $A^{\circ}$, $\partial A$ and $\operatorname{ext} A$
  are pairwise disjoint with union $\mathbb{R}$. This is not proved here and is
  not used on this page; what is used is only the definitions above and the
  characterisations of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

- **Interior and closure are dual.** Complementation exchanges the two families
  above, since $U$ is open exactly when $\mathbb{R} \setminus U$ is closed, so
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus A^{\circ} = \overline{\mathbb{R} \setminus A}$ and
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A} = (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)^{\circ} =
  \operatorname{ext} A$. The second identity is the reason the exterior is
  usually described as "the complement of the closure".

- **$A$ is open exactly when $A = A^{\circ}$, and closed exactly when
  $A = \overline{A}$.** For the first: $A^{\circ} \subseteq A$ always, and
  $A \subseteq A^{\circ}$ holds exactly when $A$ is one of the open subsets of
  $A$, that is, exactly when $A$ is open. The closure half is the same argument
  read the other way, and it is recorded as a claim of
  [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] because the rest of that theorem needs it.

- **Boundary points may or may not belong to the set.** $\partial (0,1) =
  \partial [0,1] = \{0,1\}$, and the two boundary points lie outside the first
  set and inside the second; the boundary sees only the way the set meets its
  complement, not which side the edge is assigned to.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]] and closure as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]].

- $x$ is an **adherent point** of $A$ when $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne
  \varnothing$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$.
- $x$ is a **limit point** (or *accumulation point*) of $A$ when
  $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every real
  $\varepsilon > 0$: every punctured neighbourhood of $x$ meets $A$.
- $x$ is an **isolated point** of $A$ when $x \in A$ and there is a real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$.
- The **derived set** of $A$ is
  $$A' \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \text{ is a limit point of } A \,\}.$$
- $A$ is **dense in $\mathbb{R}$** when $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$.

**A limit point is an adherent point**, since $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq
N_\varepsilon(x)$; and an element of $A$ is an adherent point of $A$, since
$x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). So the adherent
points of $A$ are exactly the points of $A \cup A'$, a statement proved as part
of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

**Limit point and isolated point are exact opposites inside $A$.** For
$x \in A$: $x$ is an isolated point of $A$ exactly when it is not a limit point
of $A$. Indeed $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$ says precisely that
$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, because $x$ itself always lies in
$N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ when $x \in A$; so the existence of an $\varepsilon$
witnessing isolation is the negation of the condition defining a limit point.
A point of $A$ is therefore either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$, and
never both.

**A limit point need not belong to the set, and a point of the set need not be a
limit point.** Both possibilities occur, and the two examples that matter later
are $0$, which is a limit point of $\{\, 1/k : k \ge 1 \,\}$ without belonging
to it, and $0$ again, which belongs to $\{0\} \cup [1,2]$ as an isolated point.

## Remarks

- **Terminology: *limit point* here is about a set, never about a sequence.**
  This library reserves *subsequential limit* for the sequential notion
  ([[def-subsequential-limit]]), and the two are genuinely different: the
  constant sequence $x_k = 0$ has $0$ as a subsequential limit, while its set of
  values $\{0\}$ has no limit point at all. The distinction is the one
  [[def-subsequential-limit]] records under "Terminology", and it is respected
  throughout this page.

- **Density is defined through the closure, not through intervals.** Saying
  $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$ is equivalent to saying that every nonempty open
  subset of $\mathbb{R}$ meets $A$, and also to saying that every neighbourhood
  of every real meets $A$; the equivalences follow from
  [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] and are used in that form in
  [[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]].

- **The derived set need not be comparable with the set.** It can be strictly
  larger, as for $\mathbb{Q}$: every punctured neighbourhood of any real
  contains a rational, since density supplies one strictly between $x$ and
  $x + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]), so the derived set of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is all of $\mathbb{R}$. It can be strictly smaller, as for
  $\{0\}$, whose derived set is empty; and it can be neither, as for
  $\{0\} \cup (1,2)$, whose derived set is $[1,2]$, a set containing points
  outside the original and omitting the point $0$ of it. A closed set satisfying
  $A \subseteq A'$ is called perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]).

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]). Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and let
$f : A \to \mathbb{R}$. Then $f$ is:

- **nondecreasing** when $f(x) \le f(y)$ for all $x, y \in A$ with $x \le y$;
- **increasing**, or *strictly increasing*, when $f(x) < f(y)$ for all
  $x, y \in A$ with $x < y$;
- **nonincreasing** when $f(x) \ge f(y)$ for all $x, y \in A$ with $x \le y$;
- **decreasing**, or *strictly decreasing*, when $f(x) > f(y)$ for all
  $x, y \in A$ with $x < y$;
- **monotone** when it is nondecreasing or nonincreasing;
- **strictly monotone** when it is increasing or decreasing.

The naming follows the convention of [[def-monotone-sequence]], which is the
convention of this library throughout: *increasing* is the strict notion and
*nondecreasing* the weak one.

**An increasing function is nondecreasing, and a decreasing function is
nonincreasing.** For $x \le y$ either $x < y$, and then $f(x) < f(y)$, hence
$f(x) \le f(y)$; or $x = y$, and then $f(x) = f(y)$. The same argument with the
inequalities reversed gives the second claim. So strictly monotone implies
monotone.

**A strictly monotone function is injective**
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]). Let $f$ be increasing and let
$x, y \in A$ with $x \ne y$. By trichotomy either $x < y$, and then
$f(x) < f(y)$, or $y < x$, and then $f(y) < f(x)$; in both cases
$f(x) \ne f(y)$. The decreasing case is the same argument. The converse fails,
and the failure is not exotic: a continuous injection on an interval *is*
strictly monotone ([[thm-continuous-injection-on-an-interval-is-strictly-monotone]]),
but on a domain that is not an interval it need not be.

**Negation exchanges the two directions.** For $g := -f$, that is
$g(x) := -f(x)$, the four conditions above are exchanged in pairs: $f$ is
nondecreasing exactly when $g$ is nonincreasing, and $f$ is increasing exactly
when $g$ is decreasing, because $u \le v$ holds exactly when $-v \le -u$
([[def-ordered-field]]). Several proofs below use this to reduce a nonincreasing
case to a nondecreasing one.

**Monotone on a set, not at a point.** All six conditions are conditions on the
whole of $A$; unlike continuity ([[def-continuity-real]]) there is no pointwise
version, and none is used in this library. The domain $A$ is an arbitrary subset
of $\mathbb{R}$; where a result needs $A$ to be an interval
([[def-interval]]) it says so, and the hypothesis is never decoration.

### The dictionary to monotone sequences

A sequence of reals is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$
([[def-sequence]]), and [[def-monotone-sequence]] calls it nondecreasing when
$x_j \le x_k$ for all $j \le k$, increasing when $x_j < x_k$ for all $j < k$,
and so on. Those are **the same four conditions as above**, read with the
ordered set $\mathbb{N}$ in place of the ordered subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$
and with the comparison of indices in place of the comparison of arguments. So
nothing new is introduced here for sequences, and the two vocabularies may be
used interchangeably: the words *nondecreasing*, *increasing*, *nonincreasing*,
*decreasing*, *monotone* and *strictly monotone* mean the corresponding
condition on the domain at hand.

One consequence is used repeatedly, and it has to be stated carefully because
composition does **not** simply preserve the four words. Let $(x_k)$ be a
**nondecreasing** sequence with $x_k \in A$ for every $k$, so that $j \le k$ gives
$x_j \le x_k$. Then:

- if $f$ is nondecreasing, $(f(x_k))$ is nondecreasing, since $f(x_j) \le f(x_k)$;
- if $f$ is nonincreasing, $(f(x_k))$ is **nonincreasing**, since
  $f(x_j) \ge f(x_k)$.

So along a nondecreasing sequence the composite inherits the direction of $f$;
and with $(x_k)$ increasing and $f$ increasing, $(f(x_k))$ is increasing, while
with $(x_k)$ increasing and $f$ decreasing, $(f(x_k))$ is decreasing.

**Along a nonincreasing sequence the direction is reversed, not inherited.** If
$(x_k)$ is nonincreasing and $f$ is nonincreasing, then $j \le k$ gives
$x_j \ge x_k$ and hence $f(x_j) \le f(x_k)$: the composite is **nondecreasing**.
The witness is $f(x) = -x$ on $A = \mathbb{R}$ with $x_k = -k$, where both $f$ and
$(x_k)$ are decreasing and $f(x_k) = k$ is increasing. Two order-reversing maps
compose to an order-preserving one, exactly as for the four words applied to
functions.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]) and its absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]).

Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ with
$\varepsilon > 0$. The **$\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\},$$

and the **punctured $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \;=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}.$$

The two descriptions of $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ agree because $|y - x| = 0$ holds
exactly when $y = x$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**A neighbourhood is an open interval.** For every $x$ and every
$\varepsilon > 0$,

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;=\; (x - \varepsilon,\ x + \varepsilon),$$

the interval of [[def-interval]]. Indeed [[lem-of-abs-value]] gives, for
$\varepsilon > 0$, the equivalence $|y - x| < \varepsilon \iff -\varepsilon <
y - x < \varepsilon$, and adding $x$ throughout turns the right-hand side into
$x - \varepsilon < y < x + \varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**The centre lies in its own neighbourhoods.** $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, since
$|x - x| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**Punctured neighbourhoods are never empty.** The element
$y := x + \varepsilon/2$ satisfies $|y - x| = \varepsilon/2$, which is
$> 0$ and $< \varepsilon$, so $y \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$
([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

**Monotonicity in the radius.** If $0 < \delta \le \varepsilon$ then
$N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, because $|y - x| < \delta \le
\varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**Nesting at an interior point.** If $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and
$0 < \delta \le \varepsilon - |y - x|$, then

$$N_\delta(y) \;\subseteq\; N_\varepsilon(x).$$

Indeed for $z \in N_\delta(y)$ the triangle inequality
([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]) gives
$|z - x| = |(z - y) + (y - x)| \le |z - y| + |y - x| < \delta + |y - x| \le
\varepsilon$. Note that $\varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ precisely because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, so such a $\delta$ always exists.

## Remarks

- **The radius is a real number, not a rational.** Nothing on this page tests a
  condition against rational radii only. That convention belongs to
  [[def-real-limit]], where the quantifier is over rational $\varepsilon$ and
  the passage between the rational and the real form is the sanctioned remark of
  [[def-sequence]]. Here $\varepsilon$ ranges over the positive reals
  throughout, and every statement above is proved for an arbitrary positive
  real.

- **Why the punctured version is separated out.** A limit point of a set is a
  point every punctured neighbourhood of which meets the set
  ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and deleting the centre is exactly what stops a point
  of the set from qualifying automatically. The unpunctured condition defines
  the weaker notion of an adherent point, and the difference between the two is
  precisely an isolated point.

- **Nesting is the workhorse.** Almost every openness verification on this page
  has the shape "given $y$ in the set, shrink the radius by the distance
  already travelled", which is the nesting property above. It is recorded here
  once so that no later proof has to redo the triangle inequality in passing.

## Definition

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ ([[def-field]]) together with a subset
$P \subseteq F$, the set of **positive** elements (the *positive cone*),
satisfying:

- **(O1) Trichotomy.** For each $x \in F$, exactly one of the following holds:
  $x \in P$, or $x = 0$, or $-x \in P$.
- **(O2) Closure.** If $x, y \in P$ then $x + y \in P$ and $x \cdot y \in P$.

We write $x > 0$ for $x \in P$ (read "$x$ is positive"), and define the order by

$$a < b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; b - a \in P, \qquad a \le b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; a < b \text{ or } a = b.$$

Thus $a > b$ means $b < a$, and $a \ge b$ means $b \le a$. An element $x$ with
$-x \in P$ (equivalently $x < 0$) is called **negative**.

## Remarks

- By trichotomy applied to $b - a$, for any $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$,
  $a = b$, $a > b$ holds; this makes $\le$ a total order.
- (O2) says the positives are closed under addition and multiplication: sums and
  products of positives are positive.
- The rationals ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and both constructions of the reals
  ([[thm-reals-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-dedekind-ordered-field]]) are ordered
  fields, so every fact proved here from (O1)-(O2) holds in each of them.

## Example

Let $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be $f(x) = x^{3}$ ([[def-integer-power]]),
with $\iota$ the canonical natural of [[def-canonical-natural]].

**Claim 1.** $f$ is differentiable at every $c \in \mathbb{R}$ with
$f'(c) = \iota(3)c^{2}$, and $f'(0) = 0$.

**Claim 2.** $f$ is increasing on $\mathbb{R}$, in the strict sense of
[[def-monotone-function]].

**Claim 3.** So the hypothesis "$f' > 0$ at every interior point" of claim 2 of
[[thm-monotonicity-from-the-derivative]] is **sufficient but not necessary** for
a function on an interval to be increasing; and the converse recorded there,
claim 5, which gives only $f' \ge 0$, cannot be strengthened to $f' > 0$.

**Claim 4.** $f$ is continuous and injective on $\mathbb{R}$, so it has a
continuous inverse $g$ on $f[\mathbb{R}]$
([[thm-derivative-of-an-inverse]]); and since $f'(0) = 0$, that inverse is
**not** differentiable at $f(0) = 0$.

Claims 1 and 2 are established in the refutation of
[[fs-vanishing-derivative-forbids-strict-increase]] and are quoted here; claims
3 and 4 are the two consequences worth drawing from them.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, $f(x) = x^{3}$.

[L1] The refutation of [[fs-vanishing-derivative-forbids-strict-increase]] establishes, for this $f$: that $f$ is differentiable at every real $c$ with $f'(c) = \iota(3)c^{2}$ ([[lem-derivative-of-a-power]], [[def-derivative]]); that $f'(0) = 0$; and that $f$ is increasing on $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-monotone-function]]).

[L2] A strictly monotone function is injective ([[def-monotone-function]], [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L3] $x \mapsto x^{n}$ is continuous at every point of its domain, for every natural $n$ ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], claim 5, [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L4] $\mathbb{R}$ is order-convex and has at least two elements ([[def-interval]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L5] Derivative of an inverse ([[thm-derivative-of-an-inverse]]): for $I$ order-convex with at least two elements and $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$ continuous and injective, with inverse $g : f[I] \to I$, and for $c \in I$ at which $f$ is differentiable, if $f'(c) = 0$ then $g$ is not differentiable at $f(c)$.

[L6] Monotonicity from the derivative ([[thm-monotonicity-from-the-derivative]]): claim 2 says that $f' > 0$ at every interior point of an interval gives an increasing function, and claim 5 says that an increasing function differentiable at a limit point of the interval has $f' \ge 0$ there.

[L7] $0^{3} = 0$, since $0^{n} = 0$ for every natural $n \ge 1$ ([[def-integer-power]]).

## Verification

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Claims 1 and 2.** By [L1] the function $f$ is differentiable at every $c \in \mathbb{R}$ with $f'(c) = \iota(3)c^{2}$, its derivative at $0$ is $0$, and $f$ is increasing on $\mathbb{R}$. [L1]

2.1 $f$ is injective by [L2], being increasing; it is continuous on $\mathbb{R}$ by [L3]; and $\mathbb{R}$ is order-convex with at least two elements by [L4]. So $f$ satisfies every hypothesis of [L5] with $I := \mathbb{R}$. [step 1.1, L2, L3, L4, L5]

2.2 **Claim 3.** The hypothesis of claim 2 of [L6] fails for $f$ on $\mathbb{R}$, since $f'(0) = 0$ is not positive, and yet the conclusion holds, $f$ being increasing on $\mathbb{R}$ by step 1.1. So that hypothesis is sufficient and not necessary. Likewise the conclusion $f' \ge 0$ of claim 5 of [L6] is attained with equality at $0$ by step 1.1, so it cannot be strengthened to $f' > 0$. [step 1.1, L6]

3.1 **Claim 4.** By step 2.1 the hypotheses of [L5] hold, and by step 1.1 the function $f$ is differentiable at $0$ with $f'(0) = 0$. So [L5] gives that the inverse $g : f[\mathbb{R}] \to \mathbb{R}$ is not differentiable at $f(0)$, which is $0$ by [L7]. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L5, L7]

4.1 All four claims are verified: claims 1 and 2 by step 1.1, claim 3 by step 2.2 and claim 4 by step 3.1. [step 1.1, step 2.2, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The set $f[\mathbb{R}]$ is not identified here, and nothing needs it to be.** [[thm-derivative-of-an-inverse]] states its conclusion about the inverse on $f[I]$, whatever that set is; that $f[\mathbb{R}] = \mathbb{R}$, so that $g$ is the cube root on the whole line, would need a surjectivity argument this item does not make and does not use.

- **Two different false readings, one witness.** That $f'(c) = 0$ forbids strict increase is refuted by claim 2; that $f'(c) = 0$ marks a local extremum is refuted by the same fact, since an increasing function has no local extremum at an interior point of its interval. The second reading is the converse of [[thm-fermat-interior-extremum]], and this page records it here rather than as a separate false statement.

- **Where the inverse fails, and why it is not surprising.** Claim 4 is not a defect of the inverse rule but a theorem: wherever the derivative of an injective continuous function vanishes, the inverse cannot be differentiable, because the chain rule would then give the identity a derivative of $0$. The cube root at $0$ is the standard picture of that, a vertical tangent, and it is proved here without any picture.

## Statement

Powers are those of [[def-integer-power]], and $\iota : \mathbb{N} \to
\mathbb{R}$ is the canonical natural of [[def-canonical-natural]], so that
$\iota(0) = 0$ and $\iota(m+1) = \iota(m) + 1$. Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

1. The function $p_0 : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, $p_0(x) = x^{0}$, is the
   constant function $1$, and it is differentiable at every $c \in \mathbb{R}$
   with $p_0'(c) = 0$ ([[def-derivative]]).
2. For $n \ge 1$ the function $p_n : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$,
   $p_n(x) = x^{n}$, is differentiable at every $c \in \mathbb{R}$, and
   $$p_n'(c) \;=\; \iota(n)\,c^{\,n-1} .$$
3. For $n \ge 1$ put $A_0 := \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \ne 0 \,\}$. The function
   $m_n : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$, $m_n(x) = x^{-n}$, is differentiable at every
   $c \in A_0$ as a function on $A_0$, and
   $$m_n'(c) \;=\; -\,\iota(n)\,c^{\,-n-1} .$$
4. Let $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with $a_j = 0$ for $j \ge n$, and let
   $P : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be the polynomial function
   $P(x) = \sum_{j<n} a_j x^{j}$ ([[def-finite-sum]]). Then $P$ is
   differentiable at every $c \in \mathbb{R}$, and, defining $e : \mathbb{N}
   \to \mathbb{R}$ by $e_0 := 0$ and $e_j := \iota(j)\,a_j\,c^{\,j-1}$ for
   $j \ge 1$,
   $$P'(c) \;=\; \sum_{j<n} e_j .$$

**Claim 2 is stated for $n \ge 1$ and not for $n \ge 0$, and that is not
timidity.** At $n = 0$ its right-hand side reads $\iota(0)\,c^{-1}$, and
$c^{-1}$ is not defined at $c = 0$ ([[def-integer-power]]), so the formula is
not a statement about the whole line. Claim 1 is what covers $n = 0$, and it
says the derivative is $0$ there, which is what the informal reading
"$0 \cdot c^{-1}$" is reaching for. The same shift is why the term $e_0$ of
claim 4 is defined to be $0$ outright rather than by the formula.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural $n$, a real $c$, and the functions $p_n$, $m_n$ and $P$ of the statement.

[L1] Powers ([[def-integer-power]]): $a^{0} = 1$ and $a^{m+1} = a^{m}a$ for every $a \in \mathbb{R}$ and $m \in \mathbb{N}$; $a^{-m} := (a^{m})^{-1}$ for $a \ne 0$ and $m \ge 1$; and $0^{m} = 0$ for $m \ge 1$.

[L2] Canonical naturals ([[def-canonical-natural]]): $\iota(0) = 0$, $\iota(m+1) = \iota(m) + 1$, and hence $\iota(1) = 1$.

[L3] Algebra of derivatives ([[thm-algebra-of-derivatives]]): at a limit point $c$ of the common domain, sums, scalar multiples and products of functions differentiable at $c$ are differentiable at $c$ with the four stated formulas, and if the denominator is nonzero at $c$ then the quotient, restricted to the set where the denominator does not vanish, is differentiable at $c$ with the quotient formula; that restricted set has $c$ as a limit point.

[L4] Derivative and difference quotient ([[def-derivative]]): $f$ is differentiable at a limit point $c$ of its domain $D$ exactly when the difference quotient $x \mapsto (f(x)-f(c))/(x-c)$, a function on $D \setminus \{c\}$, has a limit at $c$, and $f'(c)$ is that limit. A constant function $h \equiv K$ on a set having $c$ as a limit point has $\lim_{x \to c} h(x) = K$: given a real $\varepsilon > 0$, any real $\delta > 0$ serves, since $|K - K| = 0 < \varepsilon$ ([[def-function-limit]]).

[L5] Induction principle on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L6] Finite sums ([[def-finite-sum]]): $\sum_{j<0} b_j = 0$ and $\sum_{j<m+1} b_j = \bigl(\sum_{j<m} b_j\bigr) + b_m$.

[L7] Integer exponent laws for a nonzero base ([[lem-power-laws]]): $a^{k} \ne 0$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ when $a \ne 0$; and for integers $j, k$ one has $a^{j}a^{k} = a^{j+k}$, $(a^{j})^{k} = a^{jk}$ and $a^{-k} = (a^{k})^{-1}$.

[L8] Every real is a limit point of $\mathbb{R}$, punctured neighbourhoods in $\mathbb{R}$ being never empty ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 **Base case, claim 2 at $n = 1$.** By [L1], $x^{1} = x^{0}x = 1 \cdot x = x$, so $p_1$ is the identity. Fix $c \in \mathbb{R}$; for every $x \ne c$ the difference quotient is $(x - c)/(x - c) = 1$, so it is the constant function $1$ on $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{c\}$, and by [L4] and [L8] its limit at $c$ is $1$. Since $\iota(1)c^{0} = 1 \cdot 1 = 1$ by [L1] and [L2], claim 2 holds at $n = 1$. [base, L1, L2, L4, L8]

1.2 **Inductive hypothesis.** Fix a natural $n \ge 1$ and assume that $p_n$ is differentiable at every $c \in \mathbb{R}$ with $p_n'(c) = \iota(n)c^{\,n-1}$. [ih]

1.3 **Claim 1.** By [L1] the function $p_0$ is the constant function $1$. Fix $c \in \mathbb{R}$; for every $x \ne c$ its difference quotient is $(1-1)/(x-c) = 0$, the constant function $0$ on $\mathbb{R}\setminus\{c\}$, whose limit at $c$ is $0$ by [L4] and [L8]. So $p_0$ is differentiable at every $c$ with $p_0'(c) = 0$. [L1, L4, L8]

2.1 **Successor step.** Let $c \in \mathbb{R}$. By [L1], $p_{n+1}(x) = x^{n+1} = x^{n}x = p_n(x)\,p_1(x)$ for every $x$. Both factors are differentiable at $c$, by step 1.2 and step 1.1, so the product rule of [L3] gives that $p_{n+1}$ is differentiable at $c$ with $p_{n+1}'(c) = p_n'(c)p_1(c) + p_n(c)p_1'(c) = \iota(n)c^{\,n-1}c + c^{n} \cdot 1$. Now $c^{\,n-1}c = c^{\,(n-1)+1} = c^{n}$ by [L1], so the right-hand side is $\iota(n)c^{n} + c^{n} = \bigl(\iota(n)+1\bigr)c^{n} = \iota(n+1)c^{n}$ by [L2]. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1, L2, L3]

3.1 **Claim 2.** Steps 1.1 and 2.1 are the base case and the successor step of an induction over the naturals $n \ge 1$, so by [L5] the function $p_n$ is differentiable at every $c \in \mathbb{R}$ with $p_n'(c) = \iota(n)c^{\,n-1}$, for every natural $n \ge 1$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L5]

4.1 **Claim 3.** Let $n \ge 1$. The set $\{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : p_n(x) \ne 0 \,\}$ is exactly $A_0$: a nonzero $x$ has $x^{n} \ne 0$ by [L7], and $0^{n} = 0$ by [L1]. Fix $c \in A_0$. The constant function $1$ on $\mathbb{R}$ is differentiable at $c$ with derivative $0$ by step 1.3, and $p_n$ is differentiable at $c$ with derivative $\iota(n)c^{\,n-1}$ by step 3.1, with $p_n(c) = c^{n} \ne 0$. So the quotient rule of [L3] applies: the function $x \mapsto 1/x^{n}$ on $A_0$, which by [L1] and [L7] is $m_n$, is differentiable at $c$ with derivative $\bigl(0 \cdot c^{n} - 1 \cdot \iota(n)c^{\,n-1}\bigr)/(c^{n})^{2} = -\iota(n)\,c^{\,n-1}\bigl(c^{\,2n}\bigr)^{-1} = -\iota(n)\,c^{\,n-1-2n} = -\iota(n)\,c^{\,-n-1}$, where $(c^{n})^{2} = c^{\,2n}$ and $c^{\,n-1}c^{\,-2n} = c^{\,-n-1}$ are [L7]. [step 1.3, step 3.1, L1, L3, L7]

4.2 **Claim 4, by a second induction on $n$.** Fix $c \in \mathbb{R}$ and the sequence $a$. At $n = 0$ the sum $P(x) = \sum_{j<0} a_j x^{j}$ is $0$ for every $x$ by [L6], so $P$ is the constant function $0$ and, as in step 1.3, $P'(c) = 0 = \sum_{j<0} e_j$. Suppose the claim holds at $n$, and let $P_{n+1}(x) := \sum_{j<n+1} a_j x^{j}$. By [L6], $P_{n+1}(x) = P_n(x) + a_n x^{n}$ for every $x$, where $P_n(x) = \sum_{j<n} a_j x^{j}$. The function $x \mapsto a_n x^{n}$ is differentiable at $c$ with derivative $e_n$: for $n = 0$ it is the constant $a_n$, of derivative $0 = e_0$, by step 1.3 and the scalar rule of [L3]; for $n \ge 1$ it is the scalar multiple $a_n p_n$, of derivative $a_n \iota(n)c^{\,n-1} = e_n$, by step 3.1 and the scalar rule of [L3]. The inductive hypothesis gives $P_n'(c) = \sum_{j<n} e_j$, so the sum rule of [L3] gives that $P_{n+1}$ is differentiable at $c$ with $P_{n+1}'(c) = \sum_{j<n} e_j + e_n = \sum_{j<n+1} e_j$ by [L6]. By [L5] claim 4 holds for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 1.3, step 3.1, L3, L5, L6]

5.1 All four claims are established: claim 1 by step 1.3, claim 2 by step 3.1, claim 3 by step 4.1 and claim 4 by step 4.2. [step 1.3, step 3.1, step 4.1, step 4.2, discharge-induction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the induction starts at $n = 1$ and not at $n = 0$.** The successor step multiplies by the identity, and the identity is $p_1$; starting at $n = 0$ would require the formula of claim 2 to hold at $n = 0$, which it does not, since $c^{-1}$ is undefined at $c = 0$. The two statements are therefore kept apart, and claim 1 is proved on its own from the definition. This is the same index care that [[def-canonical-natural]] records for families of reciprocals: $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$, and a formula written for "$n$" is a claim about $n = 0$ unless it says otherwise.

- **The negative exponents cost nothing extra.** Claim 3 is the quotient rule of [[thm-algebra-of-derivatives]] applied with numerator the constant $1$, and the domain it produces, the set where $x^{n}$ does not vanish, is exactly $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$; no separate argument and no separate limit is needed. Rational exponents are a different matter, resting on [[thm-nth-roots-exist]], and are treated on the companion page rather than here.

- **Claim 4 is a statement about a finite sum, not about an infinite one.** Nothing here says anything about differentiating a series term by term; that is a separate question, needing hypotheses about convergence that this page does not have and does not assume.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field, with field structure as in [[def-field]], and for
$n \ge 1$ let $n \cdot 1_F$ denote the canonical natural number
$\underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$, defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$
and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$. Then for every $n \ge 1$:

- $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$;
- the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$;
- $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ and $(mn) \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F)$ for all $m, n \ge 1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ whose canonical naturals are defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, with $0 \cdot 1_F = 0$.

[L1] $0 < 1_F$ in every ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] The order is compatible with addition and positives are closed under addition: $a < b$ implies $a + c < b + c$, and $a > 0$, $b > 0$ imply $a + b > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 1$: by definition $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, and $1_F > 0$. [L1, base]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: assume $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for some fixed $n \ge 1$. [ih]

1.3 By the recursion, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F - n \cdot 1_F = 1_F > 0$, so $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$. [given, L1]

1.4 Additive identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ by the recursion, and if $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ then $(m+n+1) \cdot 1_F = (m+n) \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + (n+1) \cdot 1_F$. [given, algebra]

2.1 Inductive step: $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ is a sum of two positives, by the hypothesis and $1_F > 0$, hence $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Iterating 1.3, for $m < n$ one has $m \cdot 1_F < n \cdot 1_F$, so $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing and therefore injective on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$. [step 1.3, L2]

2.3 Multiplicative identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m \cdot 1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(1 \cdot 1_F)$, and the step $(m(n+1)) \cdot 1_F = (mn + m) \cdot 1_F = (mn) \cdot 1_F + m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F) + (m \cdot 1_F)(1_F) = (m \cdot 1_F)((n+1) \cdot 1_F)$ uses 1.4 and distributivity. [step 1.4, algebra]

3.1 By induction on 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for every $n \ge 1$; with the strict increase 2.2 and the identities 1.4, 2.3, every claim holds. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 1.4, step 2.3, discharge-induction] ∎

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with positive cone $P$, and

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, and elements $a, b, c \in F$.

[L1] For $x, y \in F$: $x < y \iff y - x \in P$; $x > 0 \iff x \in P$; $x < 0 \iff -x \in P$; and (trichotomy) for each $x$ exactly one of $x \in P$, $x = 0$, $-x \in P$ holds, so $0 \notin P$ and $x \in P \Rightarrow x \neq 0$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] $P$ is closed under multiplication: if $u, v \in P$ then $uv \in P$ (axiom O2 of [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] In any field, $(-u)v = -(uv)$ and $(-u)(-v) = uv$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] In any field, $0 \cdot u = 0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $a > 0$ and $b > 0$, i.e. $a \in P$ and $b \in P$; closure gives $ab \in P$, so $ab > 0$, proving claim 1. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.2 Assume $a > 0$ and $b < 0$, i.e. $a \in P$ and $-b \in P$; closure gives $a(-b) \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.3 Assume $a < 0$ and $b < 0$, i.e. $-a \in P$ and $-b \in P$; closure gives $(-a)(-b) \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.4 Assume $c > 0$ and $a < b$, i.e. $c \in P$ and $b - a \in P$; closure gives $(b - a)c \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

1.5 Assume $c < 0$ and $a < b$, i.e. $-c \in P$ and $b - a \in P$; closure gives $(b - a)(-c) \in P$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2]

2.1 Since $a(-b) = -(ab)$ by L3, step 1.2 gives $-(ab) \in P$, so $ab < 0$, proving claim 2. [step 1.2, L3, L1]

2.2 Since $(-a)(-b) = ab$ by L3, step 1.3 gives $ab \in P$, so $ab > 0$, proving claim 3. [step 1.3, L3, L1]

2.3 By distributivity $(b - a)c = bc - ac$, so step 1.4 gives $bc - ac \in P$, i.e. $ac < bc$: this is the forward direction of claim 4. [step 1.4, algebra, L1]

2.4 By L3 and distributivity $(b - a)(-c) = -((b - a)c) = -(bc - ac) = ac - bc$, so step 1.5 gives $ac - bc \in P$, i.e. $bc < ac$: this is the forward direction of claim 5. [step 1.5, L3, algebra, L1]

3.1 Conversely, assume $c > 0$ and $ac < bc$; by trichotomy exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds. If $a = b$ then $ac = bc$, contradicting $ac < bc$; if $b < a$ then the argument of step 2.3 applied to the pair $b < a$ gives $bc < ac$, so $bc - ac \in P$ (from $ac < bc$) while $ac - bc \in P$ (from $bc < ac$), putting the element $bc - ac$ and its negative $ac - bc$ both in $P$, which trichotomy forbids; hence $a < b$: this completes claim 4. [assume-hyp, step 2.3, L4, L1, algebra]

4.1 Conversely, assume $c < 0$ and $bc < ac$; by trichotomy exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds. If $a = b$ then $ac = bc$, contradicting $bc < ac$; if $b < a$ then the argument of step 2.4 applied to the pair $b < a$ gives $ac < bc$, so $ac - bc \in P$ (from $bc < ac$) while $bc - ac \in P$ (from $ac < bc$), putting the element $ac - bc$ and its negative $bc - ac$ both in $P$, which trichotomy forbids; hence $a < b$: this completes claim 5.

## Statement

Let $\mathbb{R}$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]), let
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $n \in \mathbb{N}$, with powers as in
[[def-integer-power]].

1. **Signs.** If $a \ge 0$ then $a^n \ge 0$, and if $a > 0$ then $a^n > 0$.
2. **Strict monotonicity in the base.** If $0 \le a < b$ and $n \ge 1$ then $a^n < b^n$. Consequently, for $a, b \ge 0$ and $n \ge 1$: $a < b \iff a^n < b^n$ and $a \le b \iff a^n \le b^n$, and $x \mapsto x^n$ is injective on $\{x \in \mathbb{R} : x \ge 0\}$.
3. **Comparison with the base.** If $a \ge 1$ and $n \ge 1$ then $a^n \ge a \ge 1$; if $a > 1$ and $n \ge 1$ then $a^n \ge a > 1$; and if $0 \le a \le 1$ then $a^n \le 1$.
4. **Monotonicity in the exponent.** If $a > 1$ then $a^m < a^n$ whenever $m < n$ in $\mathbb{N}$; if $a = 1$ then $a^n = 1$ for all $n$; and if $0 < a < 1$ then $a^m > a^n$ whenever $m < n$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $\mathbb{R}$, elements $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and naturals $m, n$.

[L1] Definition of powers ([[def-integer-power]]): $a^0 = 1$ and $a^{n+1} = a^n a$.

[L2] Induction principle ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L3] Sign and scaling rules: a product of positives is positive, and for $c > 0$, $x < y \iff cx < cy$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]); the positives are closed under addition and satisfy trichotomy ([[def-ordered-field]]); and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]], which is where that fact is proved: neither of the two items just named states it).

[L4] Multiplying inequalities of nonnegatives: if $0 \le x \le y$ and $0 \le u \le v$ then $xu \le yv$, and if $0 < x < y$ and $0 < u < v$ then $xu < yv$ ([[prop-of-multiply-inequalities]]).

[L5] Trichotomy and transitivity of the order: for $x, y$ exactly one of $x < y$, $x = y$, $y < x$ holds, and $<$ and $\le$ are transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L6] The order on the exponents: $m \le n$ holds exactly when $n = m + k$ for some natural $k$ ([[def-nat-order]]), and $m < n$ holds exactly when $m + 1 \le n$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]); combining the two, $m < n$ holds exactly when $n = m + d$ for some natural $d \ge 1$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 0$: $a^0 = 1 > 0$, so claim 1 holds; claim 2 is vacuous at $n = 0$; $a^0 = 1 \ge 1$ and $a^0 = 1 \le 1$, so claim 3 holds at $n = 0$ in the nonstrict readings. [base, L1, L3]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume, for all $a, b$: $a \ge 0 \Rightarrow a^n \ge 0$ and $a > 0 \Rightarrow a^n > 0$; and $0 \le a \le b \Rightarrow a^n \le b^n$, with $a^n < b^n$ when moreover $a < b$ and $n \ge 1$. [ih]

2.1 Signs at $n+1$: if $a \ge 0$ then $a^{n+1} = a^n a$ is a product of two nonnegatives, hence $\ge 0$, and if $a > 0$ it is a product of two positives, hence $> 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L3, L4]

3.1 Strict monotonicity at $n+1$, assuming $0 \le a < b$: then $b > 0$, and the hypothesis gives $0 \le a^n \le b^n$ with $b^n > 0$ by step 2.1; if $a = 0$ then $a^{n+1} = 0 < b^{n+1}$ since $b^{n+1} = b^n b > 0$; if $a > 0$ then $a^{n+1} = a^n a \le b^n a$ by multiplying $a^n \le b^n$ by $a > 0$, and $b^n a < b^n b$ by multiplying $a < b$ by $b^n > 0$, so $a^{n+1} < b^{n+1}$ by transitivity; and in either case $0 \le a \le b$ gives $a^{n+1} \le b^{n+1}$ by [L4]. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L1, L3, L4, L5]

4.1 By the induction principle, claims 1 and 2 hold for every $n$, in the form: $a \ge 0 \Rightarrow a^n \ge 0$; $a > 0 \Rightarrow a^n > 0$; and $0 \le a < b$ with $n \ge 1$ gives $a^n < b^n$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 3.1, L2]

5.1 The equivalences of claim 2 follow by trichotomy: for $a, b \ge 0$ and $n \ge 1$, if $a^n < b^n$ then neither $a = b$ (which would give $a^n = b^n$) nor $b < a$ (which would give $b^n < a^n$) is possible, so $a < b$; the $\le$ form is the negation of the $<$ form with $a$ and $b$ exchanged; and injectivity is the case $a^n = b^n$, where $a < b$ and $b < a$ are both excluded. [step 4.1, L5]

5.2 Claim 4: for $a > 1$ we have $a^{n+1} = a^n a > a^n \cdot 1 = a^n$, multiplying $1 < a$ by $a^n > 0$, so $a^n$ is strictly increasing in $n$, and hence $a^m < a^n$ whenever $m < n$: writing $n = m + d$ with $d \ge 1$ and inducting on $d$, the case $d = 1$ is that one-step inequality and the passage from $d$ to $d+1$ is $a^m < a^{m+d} < a^{m+d+1}$ by transitivity; for $a = 1$ an induction gives $1^n = 1$ for all $n$; and for $0 < a < 1$ we have $a^{n+1} = a^n a < a^n \cdot 1 = a^n$, so $a^n$ is strictly decreasing in $n$ and the same induction on the gap $d$ gives $a^m > a^n$ for $m < n$. [step 4.1, L1, L2, L3, L5, L6]

6.1 Claim 3: if $a \ge 1$ and $n \ge 1$ then applying step 4.1 to $1 \le a$ gives $1 = 1^n \le a^n$, and $a^n = a^{n-1} a \ge 1 \cdot a = a$ since $a^{n-1} \ge 1$ by the same argument and $a > 0$; if $a > 1$ the same computation gives $a^n \ge a > 1$; and if $0 \le a \le 1$ then $a^n \le 1^n = 1$. [step 4.1, step 5.1, L1, L3, L4]

7.1 All four claims are proved: signs and strict monotonicity in the base by the induction of steps 1.1 and 3.1, the order equivalences and injectivity by trichotomy, and the comparisons with the base and the behaviour in the exponent by steps 6.1 and 5.2. [step 4.1, step 5.1, step 6.1, step 5.2, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$, let
$\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Suppose $f$ and $g$ are continuous at
$c$ ([[def-continuity-real]]). Then:

1. $f + g$, $\alpha f$ and $fg$ are continuous at $c$;
2. $|f|$, the function $x \mapsto |f(x)|$, is continuous at $c$;
3. $\max\{f,g\}$ and $\min\{f,g\}$, defined pointwise by
   $x \mapsto \max\{f(x), g(x)\}$ and $x \mapsto \min\{f(x), g(x)\}$
   ([[def-max-min]]), are continuous at $c$;
4. if $g(c) \ne 0$ then, writing $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$, the
   point $c$ lies in $A_0$ and the quotient
   $(f/g)|_{A_0} : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$, $x \mapsto f(x)/g(x)$, is continuous at
   $c$ as a function on $A_0$.

Moreover, with no hypothesis at all:

5. every constant function $A \to \mathbb{R}$ and the identity
   $\mathrm{id} : A \to \mathbb{R}$, $x \mapsto x$, are continuous on $A$; hence
   so is $x \mapsto x^{n}$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$
   ([[def-integer-power]]), and hence so is every **polynomial function**
   $x \mapsto a_0 + a_1 x + \dots + a_n x^{n}$ with real coefficients.

Consequently, if $f$ and $g$ are continuous **on** $A$ then so are $f+g$,
$\alpha f$, $fg$, $|f|$, $\max\{f,g\}$ and $\min\{f,g\}$, and
$(f/g)|_{A_0}$ is continuous on $A_0$.

**Claim 4 is stated on $A_0$ because $f/g$ is not defined where $g$ vanishes**,
and $g$ may well vanish at points of $A$ far from $c$. The hypothesis is
$g(c) \ne 0$, not "$g$ nowhere zero"; what it buys is that $c$ itself lies in
the smaller domain, which is what makes continuity there mean anything.

**Nothing here is proved through a sequence.** Claims 1 and 4 are read off from
[[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]], which is itself proved from $\varepsilon$
and $\delta$, and claims 2, 3 and 5 are proved directly below. So no choice
principle is used anywhere in this item.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, functions $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\alpha$, a point $c \in A$ at which $f$ and $g$ are continuous, and, for claim 4, the hypothesis $g(c) \ne 0$ together with $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$.

[L1] Continuity at $c$: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L2] A point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$, and never both; at an isolated point of its domain every function is continuous; at a limit point $c$ of $A$, continuity of $f$ at $c$ is exactly the statement that the limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and equals $f(c)$ ([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-function-limit]]).

[L3] Algebra of function limits at a limit point $c$ of $A$: if the limits of $f$ and $g$ at $c$ exist with values $L$ and $M$, then the limits of $f+g$, $\alpha f$ and $fg$ at $c$ exist with values $L+M$, $\alpha L$ and $LM$; and if $M \ne 0$ then $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$, and the limit of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$ exists and equals $L/M$ ([[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]]).

[L4] Sign preservation: if the limit of $g$ at a limit point $c$ of $A$ exists and is nonzero, then $c$ is a limit point of $A_0 = \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$ ([[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]]).

[L5] Reverse triangle inequality: $\bigl||u| - |v|\bigr| \le |u - v|$ ([[cor-of-reverse-triangle]]); and $|u| \ge 0$, $|u| = 0$ exactly when $u = 0$, $|uv| = |u||v|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L6] Maximum and minimum of a two-element set of reals exist ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]), and for all reals $u, v$ one has $\max\{u,v\} = \tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(u + v + |u-v|\bigr)$ and $\min\{u,v\} = \tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(u + v - |u-v|\bigr)$.

[L7] Ordered-field arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: trichotomy and totality of the order, the field identities, and $0 < 1$ so that $2 \ne 0$ and $t/2$ is defined ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]).

[L8] Integer powers: $a^{0} = 1$ and $a^{n+1} = a^{n} \cdot a$ ([[def-integer-power]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Justification of the identity in [L6].** Let $u, v \in \mathbb{R}$. By totality either $u \ge v$ or $v \ge u$. If $u \ge v$ then $u - v \ge 0$, so $|u-v| = u-v$ and $\tfrac{1}{2}(u+v+|u-v|) = \tfrac{1}{2}(2u) = u = \max\{u,v\}$, while $\tfrac{1}{2}(u+v-|u-v|) = v = \min\{u,v\}$. If $v \ge u$ the same computation with the roles exchanged applies, since $|u-v| = v-u$ there. [L5, L6, L7]

1.2 **The isolated case.** Suppose $c$ is an isolated point of $A$, say $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ with $\eta > 0$ real. Then every function on $A$ is continuous at $c$ by [L2], which gives claims 1, 2 and 3 at once. For claim 4, assume $g(c) \ne 0$; then $c \in A_0$, and $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A_0 \subseteq N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ with $c$ in the left-hand side, so $c$ is an isolated point of $A_0$ and every function on $A_0$, in particular $(f/g)|_{A_0}$, is continuous at $c$. [L2]

1.3 **Claim 2, at any point of $A$.** Let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given and let $\delta > 0$ be as in [L1] for $f$ and this $\varepsilon$. For $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ the reverse triangle inequality gives $\bigl||f(x)| - |f(c)|\bigr| \le |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$. So $|f|$ is continuous at $c$, and no case distinction was needed. [L1, L5]

1.4 **Claim 5, constants and the identity.** If $f$ is constant then $|f(x) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$ for every $x \in A$ and every real $\varepsilon > 0$, so any $\delta > 0$ serves. For the identity, given a real $\varepsilon > 0$ take $\delta := \varepsilon$: every $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ has $|\mathrm{id}(x) - \mathrm{id}(c)| = |x - c| < \varepsilon$. Both are continuous at every point of $A$. [L1, L5, L7]

1.5 **The limit-point case, claim 1.** Suppose $c$ is a limit point of $A$. By [L2] the limits of $f$ and of $g$ at $c$ exist and equal $f(c)$ and $g(c)$. By [L3] the limits of $f+g$, $\alpha f$ and $fg$ at $c$ exist and equal $f(c)+g(c)$, $\alpha f(c)$ and $f(c)g(c)$, which are exactly the values of those three functions at $c$; by [L2] again, each of them is continuous at $c$. [L2, L3]

1.6 **The limit-point case, claim 4.** Suppose $c$ is a limit point of $A$ and $g(c) \ne 0$. Then $c \in A_0$, and by [L4] the point $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$. By [L3] the limit of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$ exists and equals $f(c)/g(c)$, which is the value of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$; by [L2] applied on the domain $A_0$, that function is continuous at $c$. [L2, L3, L4]

2.1 **Claims 1 and 4 in general.** By [L2] the point $c$ is either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$; step 1.2 settles the first case and steps 1.5 and 1.6 the second. So claims 1 and 4 hold as stated. [step 1.2, step 1.5, step 1.6, L2]

3.1 **Claim 3.** By claim 1 the function $f - g = f + (-1)g$ is continuous at $c$, by step 1.3 so is $|f-g|$, and by claim 1 again so are $f + g + |f-g|$ and its scalar multiple by $1/2$. By step 1.1 that scalar multiple is the function $x \mapsto \max\{f(x), g(x)\}$, so the maximum is continuous at $c$; the same argument with $-|f-g|$ gives the minimum. [step 1.1, step 1.3, step 2.1, L6, L7]

3.2 **Claim 5, powers and polynomials.** The map $x \mapsto x^{0}$ is the constant $1$ and $x \mapsto x^{1}$ is the identity, both continuous on $A$ by step 1.4; and if $x \mapsto x^{n}$ is continuous on $A$ then so is $x \mapsto x^{n+1} = x^{n} \cdot x$, being a product of two functions continuous on $A$ by step 2.1. By induction on $n$, $x \mapsto x^{n}$ is continuous on $A$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. A polynomial function $a_0 + a_1x + \dots + a_nx^{n}$ is obtained from these by finitely many scalar multiplications and additions, each of which preserves continuity by step 2.1. [step 1.4, step 2.1, L8]

4.1 Claims 1 to 5 are proved, all of them at an arbitrary point $c$ of $A$ and therefore, applied at every point, on the whole of $A$; and no sequence and no choice principle was used. [step 1.3, step 2.1, step 3.1, step 3.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the two-case shape, and why it is not an inconvenience.** Continuity is defined at every point of the domain, including isolated points, where no limit exists ([[def-continuity-real]]). The algebra of limits therefore cannot be applied blindly; but at an isolated point every function is continuous, so the case is settled before it is opened. Claims 2 and 5 are proved directly from $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ and need no case distinction at all.

- **Absolute value, maximum and minimum are not in [[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]]**, and the reason is that they are not needed there. They are needed here: the extreme value theorem and the one-dimensional fixed point theorem both build auxiliary functions out of maxima, minima and differences, and [[thm-compactness-is-necessary-for-evt-and-uniform-continuity]] builds its witnesses out of $|x - x_0|$ and quotients.

- **The converse of claim 2 is false**: $|f|$ may be continuous while $f$ is continuous nowhere. The function equal to $1$ on $\mathbb{Q}$ and to $-1$ elsewhere has constant absolute value; that it is nowhere continuous follows from the argument of [[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]] applied verbatim, since that argument uses only that the two values are distinct.

## Statement

Let $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be order-convex with at least two elements
([[def-interval]]), let $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $I$
([[def-continuity-real]]) and injective
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]), and let $g : f[I] \to I$ be the
inverse of $f : I \to f[I]$ supplied by [[thm-continuous-inverse]]. Let
$c \in I$ and put $b := f(c)$.

Then $c$ is a limit point of $I$ and $b$ is a limit point of $f[I]$, so that
$f'(c)$ and $g'(b)$ are meaningful symbols ([[def-derivative]]), and, assuming
$f$ is differentiable at $c$:

1. if $f'(c) \ne 0$, then $g$ is differentiable at $b$ and
   $$g'(b) \;=\; \frac{1}{f'(c)} ;$$
2. if $f'(c) = 0$, then $g$ is **not** differentiable at $b$.

**The two claims together say that the inverse inherits differentiability
exactly where the derivative does not vanish.** Nothing is asserted at a point
of $f[I]$ that is not of the form $f(c)$ with $f$ differentiable at $c$, and
nothing is asserted about $g$ being differentiable *on* a set.

**No compactness and no boundedness is assumed.** $I$ may be open, half-open or
unbounded; all that is used of it is order-convexity and the presence of two
distinct points, the latter being exactly what makes every point of $I$ a limit
point of $I$ ([[def-derivative]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An order-convex $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ with at least two elements, a continuous injective $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$, a point $c \in I$, and $b := f(c)$; from step 1.3 onwards also the hypothesis that $f$ is differentiable at $c$ ([[def-interval]], [[def-continuity-real]], [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]], [[def-derivative]]).

[L1] Continuous inverse theorem ([[thm-continuous-inverse]], claims 2, 3 and 5): $f[I]$ is order-convex; $f : I \to f[I]$ is a bijection, so there is exactly one $g : f[I] \to I$ with $g(f(x)) = x$ for every $x \in I$ and $f(g(u)) = u$ for every $u \in f[I]$; and $g$ is continuous on $f[I]$.

[L2] Carathéodory's characterisation ([[thm-caratheodory-characterisation]]), used in both directions: for $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a point $p \in D$ that is a limit point of $D$ and $h : D \to \mathbb{R}$, the function $h$ is differentiable at $p$ if and only if there is $\eta : D \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $p$, with $h(y) - h(p) = \eta(y)(y-p)$ for every $y \in D$, and then $\eta(p) = h'(p)$.

[L3] Every point of an order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ with at least two elements is a limit point of that set ([[def-derivative]], [[def-interval]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L4] Injectivity ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]): $f(x) = f(x')$ implies $x = x'$, so $x \ne c$ gives $f(x) \ne f(c)$; and the image $f[I] = \{ f(x) : x \in I \}$.

[L5] Algebra and composition of continuous functions: a composite of functions continuous at the relevant points is continuous ([[thm-composition-of-continuous-functions]]); every constant function is continuous ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], claim 5); and if $u, v : D \to \mathbb{R}$ are continuous at $p \in D$ with $v(p) \ne 0$, then $(u/v)$ restricted to $\{ y \in D : v(y) \ne 0 \}$ is continuous at $p$ ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], claim 4).

[L6] Chain rule ([[thm-chain-rule]]): with $g$ differentiable at the limit point $b = f(c)$ of $f[I]$ and $f$ differentiable at the limit point $c$ of $I$, the composite $g \circ f$ is differentiable at $c$ with $(g \circ f)'(c) = g'(b)\,f'(c)$.

[L7] The identity on a set $D$ is differentiable at every limit point $p$ of $D$ with derivative $1$: its difference quotient is $(y - p)/(y - p) = 1$ for every $y \in D \setminus \{p\}$, a constant function, whose limit at $p$ is $1$ ([[def-derivative]], [[def-function-limit]]). The derivative at a point is a single real ([[def-derivative]]), and $0 \ne 1$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $I$ has at least two elements, so by [L4] its image $f[I]$ has at least two elements; and $f[I]$ is order-convex by [L1]. So [L3] applies to both sets: every point of $I$ is a limit point of $I$, and every point of $f[I]$ is a limit point of $f[I]$. In particular $c$ is a limit point of $I$ and $b = f(c) \in f[I]$ is a limit point of $f[I]$. [L1, L3, L4]

1.2 Fix the inverse $g : f[I] \to I$ of $f : I \to f[I]$, continuous on $f[I]$; it satisfies $g(f(x)) = x$ for every $x \in I$, so in particular $g(b) = c$. [L1, choose]

1.3 Assume $f$ is differentiable at $c$. By [L2], applied to $f$ on $I$ at the limit point $c$, fix $\varphi : I \to \mathbb{R}$, continuous at $c$, with $f(x) - f(c) = \varphi(x)(x - c)$ for every $x \in I$ and $\varphi(c) = f'(c)$. [L2, choose]

2.1 $\varphi(x) \ne 0$ for every $x \in I$ with $x \ne c$: injectivity gives $f(x) \ne f(c)$, so $\varphi(x)(x-c) \ne 0$ and hence $\varphi(x) \ne 0$. If moreover $f'(c) \ne 0$ then $\varphi(c) = f'(c) \ne 0$ as well, so $\varphi$ vanishes at no point of $I$. [step 1.3, L4]

2.2 **The increment of $g$, rewritten.** Let $u \in f[I]$ and put $x := g(u) \in I$, so $f(x) = u$ by [L1]. Then $u - b = f(x) - f(c) = \varphi(x)(x - c) = \varphi(g(u))\,\bigl(g(u) - g(b)\bigr)$, using $g(b) = c$ from step 1.2. [step 1.2, step 1.3, L1]

2.3 **Claim 2.** Assume $f'(c) = 0$, and suppose $g$ were differentiable at $b$. Since $f[I] \subseteq f[I]$, since $f$ is differentiable at the limit point $c$ of $I$ and since $b = f(c)$ is a limit point of $f[I]$ by step 1.1, the chain rule [L6] gives that $g \circ f : I \to \mathbb{R}$ is differentiable at $c$ with $(g \circ f)'(c) = g'(b)\,f'(c) = g'(b) \cdot 0 = 0$. But $g \circ f$ is the identity on $I$ by step 1.2, and by [L7] the identity on $I$ is differentiable at the limit point $c$ with derivative $1$; the derivative at $c$ being a single real, this forces $0 = 1$, which [L7] excludes. So $g$ is not differentiable at $b$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L6, L7]

3.1 **The reciprocal factor.** Assume $f'(c) \ne 0$. The map $g$ is continuous at $b$ by step 1.2 and sends $f[I]$ into $I$, and $\varphi$ is continuous at $c = g(b)$ by step 1.3, so $\varphi \circ g : f[I] \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $b$ by [L5]; by step 2.1 it vanishes at no point of $f[I]$, since $g$ takes values in $I$, and $(\varphi \circ g)(b) = \varphi(c) = f'(c) \ne 0$. Hence, by [L5] applied with the constant numerator $1$ and denominator $\varphi \circ g$ on the domain $f[I]$, where the set on which the denominator does not vanish is the whole of $f[I]$, the function $\Phi := 1/(\varphi \circ g) : f[I] \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $b$ and $\Phi(b) = 1/f'(c)$. [step 1.2, step 1.3, step 2.1, L5]

4.1 **The factorisation for $g$.** Assume $f'(c) \ne 0$ and let $u \in f[I]$. Dividing the identity of step 2.2 by the nonzero number $(\varphi \circ g)(u)$ gives $g(u) - g(b) = \Phi(u)\,(u - b)$, and this holds for every $u \in f[I]$. [step 2.2, step 3.1]

5.1 **Claim 1.** Assume $f'(c) \ne 0$. By step 1.1 the point $b$ is a limit point of $f[I]$; by step 4.1 the function $\Phi : f[I] \to \mathbb{R}$ factors the increment of $g$ at $b$; and by step 3.1 it is continuous at $b$. So [L2], applied to $g$ on $f[I]$ at $b$, gives that $g$ is differentiable at $b$ with $g'(b) = \Phi(b) = 1/f'(c)$. [step 1.1, step 3.1, step 4.1, L2]

6.1 Claim 1 is step 5.1 and claim 2 is step 2.3, and the two limit-point assertions are step 1.1. [step 2.3, step 5.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why claim 2 is not a defect of the method.** It is a theorem: at a point where $f' = 0$ no inverse can be differentiable, because the chain rule would then make the derivative of the identity equal to $0$. The geometry is the familiar one, a horizontal tangent reflecting into a vertical one, and the argument above is that picture with no picture in it.

- **What is used of [[thm-continuous-inverse]], and what is not.** Only that $f[I]$ is order-convex, that the two-sided inverse exists and is unique, and that it is continuous. The strict monotonicity that theorem also proves is not needed here, though it is what makes the situation intelligible.

- **The formula is often written $g'(b) = 1/f'(g(b))$**, which is the same statement since $g(b) = c$. Written that way it is a formula for $g'$ at every point of $f[I]$ at which the hypothesis holds, and that is how the companion page uses it to differentiate $x \mapsto x^{1/n}$.

## Statement

Let $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be order-convex ([[def-interval]]), let
$f : I \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $I$ ([[def-continuity-real]]) and
differentiable at every point of $I$ interior to $I$
([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[def-derivative]]). The words
*nondecreasing*, *increasing*, *nonincreasing* and *decreasing* are those of
[[def-monotone-function]], in which *increasing* is the strict notion.

1. If $f'(x) \ge 0$ at every interior point $x$ of $I$, then $f$ is
   nondecreasing on $I$.
2. If $f'(x) > 0$ at every interior point $x$ of $I$, then $f$ is increasing on
   $I$.
3. If $f'(x) \le 0$ at every interior point $x$ of $I$, then $f$ is
   nonincreasing on $I$.
4. If $f'(x) < 0$ at every interior point $x$ of $I$, then $f$ is decreasing on
   $I$.

Conversely, with no continuity hypothesis and no hypothesis at any other point:

5. If $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$ is nondecreasing on $I$ and differentiable at a
   point $c \in I$ that is a limit point of $I$, then $f'(c) \ge 0$; if $f$ is
   nonincreasing and differentiable at such a $c$, then $f'(c) \le 0$.

**No strict converse is claimed here, and none is true.** Claim 5 gives the
weak inequality only, and it cannot be improved: an increasing function may have
a vanishing derivative at a point. That failure is recorded separately, as a
false statement later on this page, with its witness worked out on the companion
page. Reading claim 2 backwards is the single most common misuse of this
theorem, and this statement does not license it.

**Claims 1 to 4 need the interval; claim 5 does not.** The forward direction
runs through the mean value theorem on a segment joining two points of $I$, so
order-convexity is essential. Claim 5 is a statement about one point and uses
only that the difference quotients have a constant sign.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An order-convex $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a function $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$; for claims 1 to 4 also that $f$ is continuous on $I$ and differentiable at every interior point of $I$, with the stated sign condition; for claim 5 that $f$ is monotone on $I$ and differentiable at a limit point $c \in I$ of $I$.

[L1] Mean value theorem ([[cor-mean-value-theorem]]): for $u < v$ and $h : [u,v] \to \mathbb{R}$ continuous on $[u,v]$ and differentiable at every point of $(u,v)$, there is $c \in (u,v)$ with $h(v) - h(u) = h'(c)(v-u)$.

[L2] Order-convexity ([[def-interval]]): $u, v \in I$ with $u \le v$ gives $[u,v] \subseteq I$; and for $u < v$ in $I$ every $x \in (u,v)$ is interior to $I$, since $N_{\varepsilon}(x) \subseteq (u,v) \subseteq I$ for $\varepsilon := \min\{x-u,\ v-x\} > 0$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]).

[L3] Difference quotient and restriction of the domain ([[def-derivative]]): differentiability of $h$ at $p$ means that $q(x) := (h(x)-h(p))/(x-p)$ on $A \setminus \{p\}$ has limit $h'(p)$; if $B \subseteq A$, if $p \in B$ is a limit point of $B$ and if $h : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is differentiable at $p$, then $h|_B$ is differentiable at $p$ with the same derivative; and every point of an order-convex set with at least two elements is a limit point of it ([[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L4] Continuity passes to a subset of the domain ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L5] Monotone vocabulary ([[def-monotone-function]]): $f$ is nondecreasing on $I$ when $f(x) \le f(y)$ for all $x, y \in I$ with $x \le y$; increasing when $f(x) < f(y)$ for all $x < y$; nonincreasing and decreasing are the two conditions with the inequalities on the values reversed.

[L6] Order arithmetic ([[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]]): for reals $s$ and $t$ with $t > 0$, $s > 0$ gives $st > 0$, $s < 0$ gives $st < 0$ and $s = 0$ gives $st = 0$, so by trichotomy $s \ge 0$ gives $st \ge 0$ and $s \le 0$ gives $st \le 0$; a nonzero real and its inverse have the same sign, so a quotient $s/t$ with $s \ge 0$ and $t > 0$, or with $s \le 0$ and $t < 0$, is $\ge 0$, and a quotient with $s \le 0$ and $t > 0$, or with $s \ge 0$ and $t < 0$, is $\le 0$.

[L7] Limits preserve the non-strict order ([[lem-function-limit-preserves-order]]): if $h_1, h_2$ are functions on a set $D$ having $c$ as a limit point, if both limits at $c$ exist and if $h_1 \le h_2$ at every $x \in D$ with $0 < |x - c| < \eta$ for some real $\eta > 0$, then $\lim_{x \to c} h_1(x) \le \lim_{x \to c} h_2(x)$. The constant function $0$ on $D$ has limit $0$ at $c$ ([[def-function-limit]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 If $I$ has at most one element then all four of the conditions in [L5] hold on $I$ vacuously or trivially, since there is no pair $x < y$ in $I$, and claims 1 to 4 are immediate. So assume $I$ has at least two elements, and let $u, v \in I$ with $u < v$ be arbitrary. [given, L5]

1.2 **Claim 5.** Let $f$ be nondecreasing on $I$ and differentiable at a limit point $c \in I$ of $I$, and let $q(x) := (f(x)-f(c))/(x-c)$ on $I \setminus \{c\}$, so $\lim_{x \to c} q(x) = f'(c)$ by [L3]. For $x \in I$ with $x > c$ one has $f(x) \ge f(c)$ by [L5], so the numerator is $\ge 0$ while the denominator $x - c$ is $> 0$, and [L6] gives $q(x) \ge 0$. For $x \in I$ with $x < c$ one has $f(x) \le f(c)$, so the numerator is $\le 0$ while $x - c < 0$, and [L6] again gives $q(x) \ge 0$. So the constant function $0$ is $\le q$ at every point of $I \setminus \{c\}$, in particular at every such point with $0 < |x - c| < 1$; both functions have limits at the limit point $c$ of $I \setminus \{c\}$, namely $0$ and $f'(c)$, so [L7] gives $0 \le f'(c)$. The nonincreasing case is the same argument with both inequalities on the values reversed, which makes $q \le 0$ throughout and hence $f'(c) \le 0$. [L3, L5, L6, L7]

2.1 By [L2] the segment $[u,v]$ is contained in $I$ and is nondegenerate. The restriction $f|_{[u,v]}$ is continuous on $[u,v]$ by [L4]; and for $x \in (u,v)$ the point $x$ is interior to $I$ by [L2], so $f$ is differentiable at $x$, while $x$ is a limit point of $[u,v]$ by [L3], so $f|_{[u,v]}$ is differentiable at $x$ with $(f|_{[u,v]})'(x) = f'(x)$. [step 1.1, L2, L3, L4]

3.1 By step 2.1 the function $f|_{[u,v]}$ satisfies the hypotheses of [L1] on $[u,v]$, so fix $c \in (u,v)$ with $f(v) - f(u) = f'(c)\,(v-u)$; and $v - u > 0$ since $u < v$. [step 2.1, L1, choose]

4.1 If $f'(x) \ge 0$ at every interior point of $I$ then in particular $f'(c) \ge 0$, so $f(v)-f(u) = f'(c)(v-u) \ge 0$ by [L6], that is $f(u) \le f(v)$. If $f'(x) > 0$ at every interior point then $f'(c) > 0$ and the same product is $> 0$, that is $f(u) < f(v)$. [step 3.1, L6]

4.2 If $f'(x) \le 0$ at every interior point then $f'(c) \le 0$ and $f(v)-f(u) \le 0$ by [L6], that is $f(u) \ge f(v)$. If $f'(x) < 0$ at every interior point then $f'(c) < 0$ and $f(v)-f(u) < 0$, that is $f(u) > f(v)$. [step 3.1, L6]

5.1 The pair $u < v$ in $I$ was arbitrary, so steps 4.1 and 4.2 establish exactly the four conditions of [L5]: for the two non-strict ones the case $u = v$ is the trivial equality $f(u) = f(u)$, and the two strict ones are conditions on pairs $u < v$ only. Claims 1 to 4 are proved. [step 1.1, step 4.1, step 4.2, L5]

6.1 Claims 1 to 4 are step 5.1 and claim 5 is step 1.2. [step 1.2, step 5.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The forward direction is one application of the mean value theorem, and nothing more.** The sign of $f'$ at the single point the theorem produces is what decides the sign of the increment; no information about $f'$ anywhere else is used in a given comparison, and the hypothesis is imposed at every interior point only because the point produced cannot be located in advance.

- **Claim 5 is genuinely weaker than the converse of claim 2, and that is not a defect of the proof.** [[lem-function-limit-preserves-order]] destroys strictness in the limit, and no argument can restore it here, because the conclusion is false: an increasing function may have a vanishing derivative. The false statement recording that, and its witness on the companion page, are the honest form of what a reader is tempted to write.

- **What a vanishing derivative at every interior point gives** is the case $f' \ge 0$ and $f' \le 0$ together, hence nondecreasing and nonincreasing, hence constant. That is [[cor-zero-derivative-implies-constant]], proved directly above rather than deduced here, since the direct proof is shorter.
