## Statement

**False claim:** let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$ and let
$f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be differentiable at every point of $(a,b)$ as a
function on $[a,b]$ ([[def-derivative]], [[def-interval]]). Then there is
$c \in (a,b)$ with

$$f(b) - f(a) \;=\; f'(c)\,(b - a) .$$

This is [[cor-mean-value-theorem]] with the hypothesis "$f$ is continuous on
$[a,b]$" deleted, everything else left as it stands. It is false.

**Why it is tempting.** The conclusion mentions $f'$ only at interior points,
and the hypothesis of continuity on the closed interval looks like a technical
condition guaranteeing nothing the differentiability does not already give. It
is not: the values $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ appear on the left-hand side of the
conclusion, and nothing in a hypothesis about $(a,b)$ alone connects them to the
behaviour of $f$ inside. A single unrelated value at one endpoint breaks the
identity outright.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The interval $[0,1]$ and the function $f : [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x) := x$ for $x \in [0,1)$ and $f(1) := 0$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L1] Derivative ([[def-derivative]]): for $c \in [0,1]$ a limit point of $[0,1]$, the difference quotient $q(x) := (f(x)-f(c))/(x-c)$ is a function on $[0,1] \setminus \{c\}$, and $f$ is differentiable at $c$ with $f'(c) = L$ exactly when for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x \in [0,1]$ with $0 < |x-c| < \delta$ satisfies $|q(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ ([[def-function-limit]]).

[L2] Every point of $[0,1]$ is a limit point of $[0,1]$, that set being order-convex with at least two elements ([[def-derivative]], [[def-interval]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L3] Absolute value and order ([[lem-of-abs-value]]): $|u| \ge 0$; $|u| = 0$ exactly when $u = 0$; and for $\delta > 0$ the condition $|y - c| < \delta$ is $c - \delta < y < c + \delta$.

[L4] $0 \ne 1$ in $\mathbb{R}$, since $0 < 1$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L5] Continuity at a point ([[def-continuity-real]]): $f$ is continuous at $p \in [0,1]$ when for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x \in [0,1]$ with $|x - p| < \delta$ satisfies $|f(x) - f(p)| < \varepsilon$.

[L6] Rolle's theorem ([[thm-rolle]]) carries the same continuity hypothesis on the closed interval as [[cor-mean-value-theorem]] does.

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $f$ is a well-defined function on $[0,1]$: every $x \in [0,1]$ either equals $1$ or does not, exclusively, so exactly one of the two clauses applies to it. [given]

1.2 $f(0) = 0$, since $0 \in [0,1)$, and $f(1) = 0$ by the second clause. Hence $f(1) - f(0) = 0$, and also $f(0) = f(1)$. [given]

2.1 **The derivative inside.** Let $c \in (0,1)$ and put $\delta := \min\{c,\ 1-c\}$, a positive real. Every $x \in [0,1]$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $x < c + \delta \le c + (1-c) = 1$ by [L3], so $x \in [0,1)$ and $f(x) = x$; and $c \in [0,1)$, so $f(c) = c$. Therefore $q(x) = (x - c)/(x - c) = 1$ for every such $x$. [step 1.1, L3]

2.2 **$f$ is not continuous at $1$.** Take $\varepsilon := 1/2$ and let a real $\delta > 0$ be given. Put $x := \max\{1 - \delta/2,\ 1/2\}$; then $1/2 \le x < 1$, so $x \in [0,1)$ and $f(x) = x$, while $|x - 1| \le \delta/2 < \delta$. Yet $|f(x) - f(1)| = |x - 0| = x \ge 1/2 = \varepsilon$. So no $\delta$ witnesses the condition of [L5] at $p = 1$ for this $\varepsilon$. [step 1.1, L3, L5]

3.1 Let $c \in (0,1)$ and let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. The $\delta$ of step 2.1 satisfies: every $x \in [0,1]$ with $0 < |x-c| < \delta$ has $|q(x) - 1| = |1 - 1| = 0 < \varepsilon$ by [L3]. Since $c$ is a limit point of $[0,1]$ by [L2], this is exactly the condition of [L1] with $L := 1$. So $f$ is differentiable at $c$ with $f'(c) = 1$. [step 2.1, L1, L2, L3]

4.1 **The claim fails on this witness.** By step 3.1 the function $f$ is differentiable at every point of $(0,1)$, so it satisfies the hypothesis of the false claim with $a := 0$ and $b := 1$. For every $c \in (0,1)$ one has $f'(c)(b-a) = 1 \cdot (1 - 0) = 1$, while $f(b) - f(a) = f(1) - f(0) = 0$ by step 1.2. By [L4] these are different, so no $c \in (0,1)$ satisfies the asserted identity, and the claim is false. [step 1.2, step 3.1, L4]

5.1 The same witness refutes the corresponding weakening of Rolle's theorem: by step 1.2 one has $f(0) = f(1)$, and by step 3.1 one has $f'(c) = 1 \ne 0$ at every $c \in (0,1)$, so no interior point carries a vanishing derivative. What is missing in both cases is exactly the hypothesis deleted, continuity on the closed interval, and step 2.2 shows it fails at the single point $1$. [step 1.2, step 2.2, step 3.1, step 4.1, L6] ∎

## Remarks

- **The witness is as small as it can be.** It agrees with the identity except at one endpoint, and it is differentiable at every interior point with the constant derivative $1$. Nothing about the interior is disturbed; only the value $f(1)$ is moved, and the conclusion of the mean value theorem is a statement about that value.

- **Where the true proof would break.** [[cor-mean-value-theorem]] runs through [[thm-rolle]], and Rolle runs through [[thm-extreme-value-r]], which needs $f$ continuous on the compact set $[a,b]$. With continuity failing at $1$ the supremum of $f$ over $[0,1]$ is $1$ and is not attained, so the extreme value theorem has nothing to hand back and every later step is unavailable.

- **Continuity at the endpoints is the only thing deleted.** In particular the witness is continuous at every point of $(0,1)$, being differentiable there; it is even continuous at $0$. So the false claim cannot be repaired by asking for continuity on $[a,b)$, or on $(a,b]$ after reflecting the witness, and it is the closed interval that is needed.

The clause $0 < |x - c|$ removes $x = c$ from both\nquantifiers, so in both cases the points quantified over are exactly the\n$x \\in A \\setminus \\{c\\}$ with $0 < |x - c| < \\delta$, at which $Q$ and\n$q_{f,c}$ take the same value.

This\n   is what allows a limit to be taken at a point where the function is not\n   defined at all, as at $0$ for $x \\mapsto x\\,\\psi(1/x)$.\n\n3. **The value $f(c)$, when it exists, is irrelevant.** The hypothesis\n   $0 < |x - c|$ excludes $x = c$ from the quantifier, so changing $f$ at the\n   single point $c$ changes nothing.

The forms $[a,b)$ and\n$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.\n\n**The symbols $\\pm\\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\\mathbb{R}$.** They\nmark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right\ncolumn are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is\never performed with $\\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\\mathbb{R}$\nsilently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.\n\n**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction\nof at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \\le x$, $x < b$ or\n$x \\le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if\n$a < x$ and $x \\le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \\le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,\nby transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever\none or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \\in I$ whenever\n$x, y \\in I$ and $x \\le z \\le y$.\n\n**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly\nwhen it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower\nbound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or\nsides written with $\\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.\n\n**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,\nand **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with\nendpoints $a$ and $b$:\n\n- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \\le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly\n  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\\{a\\}$ when $a = b$.\n- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each\n  is nondegenerate.\n\nThe only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is\nthat $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because\n$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to\nboth sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside\n$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.\n\n**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \\le b$, which is\nexactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested\ninterval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always\ncarries the hypothesis $a \\le b$ in this library.\n\n**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints\n$a \\le b$ is\n\n$$\\ell = b - a \\;\\ge\\; 0 .$$\n\nLength is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the\nset: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is\n$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so\nnothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every\npoint where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.\nUnbounded intervals are assigned no length.",

The limit is undefined there; the continuity is defined, and is\nautomatic. Clause 1 is the only place where the two notions meet, and it is\nstated only where the limit exists as a notion.\n\n**Where the distinction disappears.** If $A$ is an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}$\n([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), then every $c \\in A$ has some\n$N_{\\eta}(c) \\subseteq A$, and a punctured neighbourhood is never empty\n([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), so every point of $A$ is a limit point of $A$ and\nclause 1 covers the whole of $A$. The same holds when $A$ is a nondegenerate\ninterval ([[def-interval]]).

## Statement

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$ and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be
continuous on $[a,b]$ ([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-interval]]) and
differentiable at every point of $(a,b)$ as a function on $[a,b]$
([[def-derivative]]). Then there is $c \in (a,b)$ with

$$f(b) - f(a) \;=\; f'(c)\,(b - a) .$$

Equivalently, since $b - a \ne 0$, there is $c \in (a,b)$ at which
$f'(c) = \bigl(f(b)-f(a)\bigr)/(b-a)$: the derivative somewhere inside equals
the average rate of change across the whole interval.

**Continuity on the closed interval cannot be dropped.** Differentiability at
every point of $(a,b)$ alone does not suffice: a function on $[0,1]$,
differentiable at every point of $(0,1)$ with derivative constantly $1$, for
which no $c$ works, is exhibited later on this page as a false statement, and
the companion page works the same witness out in full.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and a function $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable at every point of $(a,b)$.

[L1] Cauchy's mean value theorem ([[thm-cauchy-mean-value]]): for $f, g$ continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable at every point of $(a,b)$ there is $c \in (a,b)$ with $\bigl(f(b)-f(a)\bigr)g'(c) = \bigl(g(b)-g(a)\bigr)f'(c)$.

[L2] The identity $x \mapsto x$ is continuous at every point of any $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], claim 5).

[L3] The identity $g$ on $[a,b]$ is differentiable at every $c \in [a,b]$ with $g'(c) = 1$: with $a < b$ the set $[a,b]$ is order-convex with at least two elements, so every one of its points is a limit point of it ([[def-derivative]], [[def-interval]]); and the difference quotient of $g$ at $c$ is $(x - c)/(x - c) = 1$ for every $x \in [a,b]$ with $x \ne c$, a constant function, whose limit at $c$ is $1$ ([[def-function-limit]], [[def-derivative]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Define $g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ by $g(x) := x$. [construct]

2.1 $g$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ by [L2]; it is differentiable at every $c \in (a,b)$ with $g'(c) = 1$ by [L3]; and $g(b) - g(a) = b - a$. [step 1.1, L2, L3]

3.1 By step 2.1 the pair $f, g$ satisfies every hypothesis of [L1], so there is $c \in (a,b)$ with $\bigl(f(b)-f(a)\bigr)g'(c) = \bigl(g(b)-g(a)\bigr)f'(c)$. Substituting $g'(c) = 1$ and $g(b)-g(a) = b-a$ gives $f(b) - f(a) = f'(c)(b-a)$. [step 2.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The geometric reading, and what it is not.** The conclusion says that some tangent line is parallel to the chord from $(a, f(a))$ to $(b, f(b))$. It does not say which one, it does not say there is only one, and it says nothing at all about $f$ between the endpoints beyond the hypotheses. Every use of the theorem on this page is a use of the equation, never of the picture.

- **Why this is a corollary and not the primitive statement.** [[thm-cauchy-mean-value]] is proved from [[thm-rolle]] with one auxiliary function, and this statement is that theorem at $g(x) = x$; deriving it the other way round, from this statement to Cauchy's, is also possible but needs an auxiliary function of its own, so nothing is saved. What matters is that both rest on Rolle, and Rolle on the extreme value theorem.

- **The two hypotheses are on different sets on purpose.** Continuity is asked for on the closed interval and differentiability only on the open one, so nothing at all is required of the difference quotients at $a$ and at $b$. Weakening the continuity in step with the differentiability, so that both are asked for on $(a,b)$ only, destroys the theorem, which is exactly what [[cex-mean-value-theorem-fails-without-continuity-at-the-endpoints]] shows on the companion page.

## Statement

In any ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, the multiplicative identity
satisfies $0 < 1$; that is, $1 \in P$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$ and multiplicative identity $1$ ([[def-field]]).

[L1] In any field $1 \neq 0$ ([[def-field]]).

[L2] For every $x \neq 0$ the square satisfies $x^2 > 0$ ([[lem-of-square-positive]]).

[L3] The identity axiom gives $1 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1^2$ ([[def-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By the field axioms $1 \neq 0$, and $1 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1^2$. [L1, L3]

2.1 Since $1 \neq 0$, applying the square lemma with $x = 1$ gives $1^2 > 0$. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 Because $1 = 1^2$, it follows that $1 > 0$, i.e. $0 < 1$. [step 2.1, step 1.1, L3] ∎

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field with its order and
absolute value ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]), and
neighbourhoods are those of [[def-neighbourhood-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Then
$f$ is **continuous at $c$** when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

with $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ ranging over the **positive reals**. In the
language of neighbourhoods: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ with

$$f\bigl(A \cap N_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \;\subseteq\; N_{\varepsilon}\bigl(f(c)\bigr).$$

$f$ is **continuous on $A$** when it is continuous at every point of $A$.

**The point $c$ is required to lie in $A$, and the condition is unpunctured.**
Both differ from [[def-function-limit]], and deliberately. There the quantifier
runs over $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, which removes $x = c$; here $x = c$ is allowed,
and at $x = c$ the implication reads $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$, which is
automatic. So allowing $x = c$ costs nothing, and it is what lets the definition
be stated at every point of $A$, including the points where no limit exists.

**Three clauses, and all three are part of the definition.**

1. **At a limit point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is a limit point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]). Then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if the
   limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) \;=\; f(c)$$
   ([[def-function-limit]]). Indeed, for a given $\varepsilon > 0$ a $\delta$
   witnessing continuity witnesses the limit condition, because the limit
   condition quantifies over a subset of the points continuity quantifies over;
   and conversely a $\delta$ witnessing $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$ witnesses
   continuity, because the one point it omits, $x = c$, satisfies
   $|f(c) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ anyway.

2. **At an isolated point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is an isolated point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so that $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ for some real
   $\eta > 0$. Then **every** $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$: take
   $\delta := \eta$, so that the only $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ is $c$
   itself, and $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$.

3. **On a set.** Continuity on $A$ is continuity at each point of $A$, and
   nothing more. It is not a condition relating $f$ to points outside $A$.

Every point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$,
and never both ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so clauses 1 and 2 between them describe
continuity at every point of $A$.

**This is not the raw $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula of
[[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]].** That item records what goes
wrong when the *punctured* formula of [[def-function-limit]] is written down at
an arbitrary point of the domain: at an isolated point it is satisfied
vacuously by every real $L$ at once, so it defines nothing, and this library
therefore leaves $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ **undefined** at an isolated point.
Continuity at an isolated point is a different matter: the formula above is not
vacuous — it is a genuine condition on $f(c)$, satisfied because $f(c)$ is the
only value being compared with itself — and it names a single, well-defined
property. The limit is undefined there; the continuity is defined, and is
automatic. Clause 1 is the only place where the two notions meet, and it is
stated only where the limit exists as a notion.

**Where the distinction disappears.** If $A$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), then every $c \in A$ has some
$N_{\eta}(c) \subseteq A$, and a punctured neighbourhood is never empty
([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), so every point of $A$ is a limit point of $A$ and
clause 1 covers the whole of $A$. The same holds when $A$ is a nondegenerate
interval ([[def-interval]]). Isolated points are what force clause 2 to exist at
all, and they occur as soon as $A$ is allowed to be an arbitrary subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, as in $A = \{0\} \cup [1,2]$.

## Remarks

- **Continuity is local.** If $\eta > 0$ and $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agrees with
  $f$ on $A \cap N_{\eta}(c)$, then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if $g$
  is: any $\delta$ may be replaced by $\min\{\delta, \eta\}$, after which the
  condition only ever evaluates the two functions where they agree. So
  continuity at $c$ sees only an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of $c$, exactly
  as the limit does ([[lem-limit-is-local]]).

- **Continuity passes to subsets of the domain.** If $B \subseteq A$ and
  $c \in B$, then continuity of $f$ at $c$ gives continuity of the restriction
  $f|_B$ at $c$, with the same $\delta$: the condition on $f|_B$ quantifies over
  fewer points. The converse fails, and the standard witness is the indicator of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ restricted to $\mathbb{Q}$, which is constant and hence
  continuous, while the indicator itself is continuous nowhere
  ([[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]]).

- **The radius is a real number.** As in [[def-neighbourhood-r]], $\varepsilon$
  and $\delta$ range over the positive reals here. Restricting either quantifier
  to the positive rationals defines the same relation, by the passage recorded
  in [[def-function-limit]]: below every positive real lies a positive rational
  ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and a real $\delta$ may be shrunk to a rational
  one below it.

- **The word *continuous* is used for two things in this library, and they
  agree.** [[def-metric-continuity]] defines continuity of a map between metric
  spaces, and $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ carries the metric $d(x,y) = |x-y|$. The
  two notions coincide, and that is proved, not assumed:
  [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]] is the dictionary, and it is stated on
  this page precisely so that no later item has to guess.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), neighbourhoods are those of
[[def-neighbourhood-r]] and limit points those of [[def-limit-point-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$ be a
**limit point of $A$**. The **difference quotient of $f$ at $c$** is the function

$$q_{f,c} : A \setminus \{c\} \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad q_{f,c}(x) := \frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c} .$$

The division is legitimate at every point of the domain, since $x \ne c$ gives
$x - c \ne 0$.

**The point $c$ is a limit point of $A \setminus \{c\}$, not merely of $A$.**
For every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the punctured neighbourhood
$N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c)$ omits $c$, so

$$N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c) \cap A \;=\; N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(c) \cap (A \setminus \{c\}) ,$$

and the left-hand side is nonempty because $c$ is a limit point of $A$. So
$q_{f,c}$ is a function on a set having $c$ as a limit point, and
$\lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x)$ is a notion that [[def-function-limit]] defines.

$f$ is **differentiable at $c$** when that limit exists, and then the
**derivative of $f$ at $c$** is

$$f'(c) \;:=\; \lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x) \;=\; \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c} .$$

**Two obligations are carried by that notation, and both are discharged here.**

1. **Uniqueness.** Writing $f'(c)$ treats the right-hand side as a name for a
   single real number. That is legitimate: $c$ is a limit point of the domain
   $A \setminus \{c\}$ of $q_{f,c}$, so at most one real can satisfy the
   $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ condition, by [[lem-function-limit-unique]] applied to
   $q_{f,c}$. Two reals both meeting the condition are therefore equal, and the
   symbol denotes.
2. **Meaningfulness.** The hypothesis that $c$ is a limit point of $A$ is not
   decoration. At an **isolated** point of $A$ the punctured condition
   $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ is met by no point of the domain at all, so the
   $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula is satisfied vacuously by *every* real at
   once; this is why [[def-function-limit]] leaves the limit undefined there,
   and it is why this library defines $f'(c)$ only at a limit point of $A$. At
   an isolated point of its domain a function is neither differentiable nor
   non-differentiable here: the question is not posed.

**The limit sees only $A \setminus \{c\}$, so how the difference quotient is
extended to $c$ is irrelevant.** Let $Q : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agree with
$q_{f,c}$ at every point of $A \setminus \{c\}$, and let $L \in \mathbb{R}$.
Then $\lim_{x \to c} Q(x) = L$ if and only if $\lim_{x \to c} q_{f,c}(x) = L$.
Both conditions read: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ such that every point $x$ of the relevant domain with
$0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|{\cdot} - L| < \varepsilon$
([[def-function-limit]]). The clause $0 < |x - c|$ removes $x = c$ from both
quantifiers, so in both cases the points quantified over are exactly the
$x \in A \setminus \{c\}$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, at which $Q$ and
$q_{f,c}$ take the same value. The two conditions are the same condition.

**Differentiability on a set.** For $S \subseteq A$, $f$ is **differentiable on
$S$** when it is differentiable at every $c \in S$; implicit in that phrase is
that every point of $S$ is a limit point of $A$. $f$ is **differentiable** when
it is differentiable on the whole of $A$.

**Restriction of the domain.** Let $B \subseteq A$, let $c \in B$ and suppose
$c$ is a limit point of $B$. If $f$ is differentiable at $c$, then so is the
restriction $f|_B : B \to \mathbb{R}$, and

$$(f|_B)'(c) \;=\; f'(c) .$$

Indeed $B \setminus \{c\} \subseteq A \setminus \{c\}$; the displayed identity
of punctured neighbourhoods above, applied to $B$, shows that $c$ is a limit
point of $B \setminus \{c\}$; the difference quotient $q_{f|_B, c}$ is the
restriction of $q_{f,c}$ to $B \setminus \{c\}$, since $f|_B(c) = f(c)$; and
claim 2 of [[lem-limit-is-local]] carries the limit to that restriction.

**Every point of a nondegenerate interval is a limit point of it.** Let
$J \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be order-convex ([[def-interval]]) with at least two
elements and let $p \in J$. Choose $q \in J$ with $q \ne p$, and let a real
$\varepsilon > 0$ be given. If $p < q$, put $y := p + \tfrac{1}{2}\min\{\varepsilon,\ q - p\}$;
then $p < y$, and $y - p \le \tfrac{1}{2}(q-p) < q - p$, so $p < y < q$ and
order-convexity gives $y \in J$, while $0 < |y - p| < \varepsilon$. If $q < p$,
the point $y := p - \tfrac{1}{2}\min\{\varepsilon,\ p - q\}$ serves in the same
way. So $N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(p) \cap J \ne \varnothing$ for every real
$\varepsilon > 0$, that is, $p$ is a limit point of $J$
([[def-limit-point-r]]).

Consequently, for $f$ defined on a nondegenerate interval $I$, the symbol
$f'(c)$ is meaningful at **every** $c \in I$, endpoints included. At an endpoint
the difference quotient is taken over the points of $I$ lying on the one side
that is available, so what other texts call a one-sided derivative is, here,
simply the derivative of $f$ on $I$.

## Remarks

- **Notation.** $f'(c)$ and $\frac{df}{dx}(c)$ denote the same real number, and
  this library uses the first. Neither is an operation performed on a symbol
  $x$: the variable in the second is a name for the argument and nothing more.

- **Differentiability is a property of the pair $(f, A)$ at $c$, not of $f$
  alone.** The restriction clause above goes in one direction only, and the
  converse fails. Take $A := \mathbb{R}$, $f(x) := |x|$, $B := [0,\infty)$ and
  $c := 0$. Then $f|_B$ is the identity on $B$, whose difference quotient at $0$
  is constantly $1$, so $f|_B$ is differentiable at $0$ with derivative $1$;
  that $f$ itself is not differentiable at $0$ is
  [[cex-absolute-value-is-not-differentiable-at-zero]] on the companion page.
  So enlarging the domain can destroy differentiability, and the phrase
  "$f$ is differentiable at $c$" always carries the domain with it.

- **The relation to continuity is not definitional.** [[def-continuity-real]]
  is a condition on $f$ near $c$ that does not mention a quotient, and it is
  defined at every point of $A$, isolated points included, whereas
  differentiability is defined only at limit points of $A$. That
  differentiability implies continuity is a theorem on this page and not a
  reading of the definitions.

- **No second derivative and no one-sided derivative is introduced here.**
  Both are standard, and both are absent from this page on purpose;
  [[rem-derivative-conventions]] records exactly what is fixed and what is left
  open at this point in the reading order.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) with its order and absolute value
([[def-real-order]]).

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$, let $c \in \mathbb{R}$
be a **limit point** of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and let $L \in \mathbb{R}$.
We say that **$f(x)$ tends to $L$ as $x$ tends to $c$**, and write

$$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L ,$$

when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ 0 < |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - L| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

where $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ range over the **positive reals**.

In the language of neighbourhoods ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]) the condition reads:
for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ with

$$f\bigl(A \cap N^{*}_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \;\subseteq\; N_{\varepsilon}(L),$$

$N^{*}_{\delta}(c) = \{\, y : 0 < |y - c| < \delta \,\}$ being the punctured
$\delta$-neighbourhood of $c$ and $N_{\varepsilon}(L) = (L - \varepsilon,\ L +
\varepsilon)$ the open interval of [[def-interval]]. The two forms agree because
$|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ says exactly $f(x) \in N_\varepsilon(L)$, and
$0 < |x - c| < \delta$ says exactly $x \in N^{*}_\delta(c)$.

**Three features of this definition are load bearing, not decoration.**

1. **$c$ is required to be a limit point of $A$.** By [[def-limit-point-r]] that
   says every punctured neighbourhood of $c$ meets $A$, so for every $\delta > 0$
   the set $A \cap N^{*}_\delta(c)$ over which the implication quantifies is
   nonempty. Drop the requirement and the implication can be satisfied
   vacuously by *every* real $L$ at once, which is exactly what
   [[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]] records. At a point of $A$
   that is not a limit point of $A$ — an isolated point — the symbol
   $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ is therefore **not defined** in this library.

2. **$c \in A$ is not required.** A limit point of $A$ need not belong to $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and the definition never evaluates $f$ at $c$. This
   is what allows a limit to be taken at a point where the function is not
   defined at all, as at $0$ for $x \mapsto x\,\psi(1/x)$.

3. **The value $f(c)$, when it exists, is irrelevant.** The hypothesis
   $0 < |x - c|$ excludes $x = c$ from the quantifier, so changing $f$ at the
   single point $c$ changes nothing. Equality of the limit with the value is an
   extra condition, not a consequence: [[fs-limit-equals-value]].

**The notation presumes uniqueness.** Writing $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$ treats
the left-hand side as a name for a single real number, which is legitimate only
because at a limit point at most one $L$ can satisfy the displayed condition.
That obligation is discharged by [[lem-function-limit-unique]], recorded in this
item's `justified_by`. As with $\sup S$ ([[rem-sup-conventions]]) and
$\lim_k x_k$ ([[lem-limit-unique]]), the symbol is written only for a function
already known to have a limit at $c$.

**Real and rational $\varepsilon$ define the same relation.** Above,
$\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ range over the positive reals. Restricting either
quantifier to the positive rationals gives the same relation: every positive
rational is a positive real, and below every positive real lies a positive
rational ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), so an $\varepsilon$-condition verified for
all positive rationals is verified for an arbitrary positive real $\eta$ by
running it at a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, and a
$\delta$ produced as a real may be shrunk to a rational one below it. This is
the passage sanctioned in the remarks of [[def-sequence]], and it is what lets
this definition be compared with [[def-real-limit]], whose $\varepsilon$ is
rational, in [[thm-sequential-criterion-for-function-limits]].

## Remarks

- **Terminology.** *Limit point* here is a property of the set $A$ and the point
  $c$, in the sense of [[def-limit-point-r]]; it has nothing to do with
  subsequential limits ([[def-subsequential-limit]]), and the distinction is the
  one that item records.

- **Why the punctured condition, and not $|x - c| < \delta$.** With the
  unpunctured condition the definition would force $f$ to be defined at $c$ and
  would force $|f(c) - L| < \varepsilon$ for every $\varepsilon$, that is,
  $L = f(c)$. The resulting notion is continuity at $c$, a strictly stronger
  condition, and conflating the two is the error catalogued in
  [[fs-limit-equals-value]].

- **One-sided and infinite variants.** Restricting the domain to one side of $c$
  gives the one-sided limits of [[def-one-sided-limits]]; replacing the
  conditions on $x$ or on $f(x)$ by unboundedness conditions gives the limits at
  and to infinity of [[def-limits-at-infinity]]. Both are built on this
  definition rather than beside it.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]] and closure as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]].

- $x$ is an **adherent point** of $A$ when $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne
  \varnothing$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$.
- $x$ is a **limit point** (or *accumulation point*) of $A$ when
  $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every real
  $\varepsilon > 0$: every punctured neighbourhood of $x$ meets $A$.
- $x$ is an **isolated point** of $A$ when $x \in A$ and there is a real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$.
- The **derived set** of $A$ is
  $$A' \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \text{ is a limit point of } A \,\}.$$
- $A$ is **dense in $\mathbb{R}$** when $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$.

**A limit point is an adherent point**, since $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq
N_\varepsilon(x)$; and an element of $A$ is an adherent point of $A$, since
$x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). So the adherent
points of $A$ are exactly the points of $A \cup A'$, a statement proved as part
of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

**Limit point and isolated point are exact opposites inside $A$.** For
$x \in A$: $x$ is an isolated point of $A$ exactly when it is not a limit point
of $A$. Indeed $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$ says precisely that
$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, because $x$ itself always lies in
$N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ when $x \in A$; so the existence of an $\varepsilon$
witnessing isolation is the negation of the condition defining a limit point.
A point of $A$ is therefore either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$, and
never both.

**A limit point need not belong to the set, and a point of the set need not be a
limit point.** Both possibilities occur, and the two examples that matter later
are $0$, which is a limit point of $\{\, 1/k : k \ge 1 \,\}$ without belonging
to it, and $0$ again, which belongs to $\{0\} \cup [1,2]$ as an isolated point.

## Remarks

- **Terminology: *limit point* here is about a set, never about a sequence.**
  This library reserves *subsequential limit* for the sequential notion
  ([[def-subsequential-limit]]), and the two are genuinely different: the
  constant sequence $x_k = 0$ has $0$ as a subsequential limit, while its set of
  values $\{0\}$ has no limit point at all. The distinction is the one
  [[def-subsequential-limit]] records under "Terminology", and it is respected
  throughout this page.

- **Density is defined through the closure, not through intervals.** Saying
  $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$ is equivalent to saying that every nonempty open
  subset of $\mathbb{R}$ meets $A$, and also to saying that every neighbourhood
  of every real meets $A$; the equivalences follow from
  [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] and are used in that form in
  [[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]].

- **The derived set need not be comparable with the set.** It can be strictly
  larger, as for $\mathbb{Q}$: every punctured neighbourhood of any real
  contains a rational, since density supplies one strictly between $x$ and
  $x + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]), so the derived set of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is all of $\mathbb{R}$. It can be strictly smaller, as for
  $\{0\}$, whose derived set is empty; and it can be neither, as for
  $\{0\} \cup (1,2)$, whose derived set is $[1,2]$, a set containing points
  outside the original and omitting the point $0$ of it. A closed set satisfying
  $A \subseteq A'$ is called perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]).

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$, with
$|x|$ the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]). Then

$$|x| \ge 0; \quad |x| = 0 \iff x = 0; \quad -|x| \le x \le |x|; \quad |-x| = |x|; \quad |xy| = |x|\,|y|;$$

and, for every $c > 0$, one has $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and elements $x, y \in F$.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| = u$ if $u \ge 0$, and $|u| = -u$ if $u < 0$ ([[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Ordered-field order: trichotomy holds (for each $u$ exactly one of $u > 0$, $u = 0$, $u < 0$), $a < b$ means $b - a$ is positive, and sums and products of positives are positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Signs in products: $(-a)b = -(ab)$ and $(-a)(-b) = ab$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] Sign rules: a product of two elements of the same sign is positive, and a product of two elements of opposite sign is negative ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Case $x > 0$: by [L1] $|x| = x > 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; since $-x < 0$ we get $|-x| = -(-x) = x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -x < 0 < x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case pos, L1, L2, algebra]

1.2 Case $x = 0$: then $|x| = |0| = 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ holds with $|x| = 0$ and $x = 0$, while $|-x| = |0| = |x|$ and $-|x| = 0 \le 0 \le 0 = |x|$. [assume-case zero, L1]

1.3 Case $x < 0$: by [L1] $|x| = -x$, and [L2] gives $-x > 0$, so $|x| > 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; here $|-x| = -x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -(-x) = x \le x$ while $x < 0 < -x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case neg, L1, L2, algebra]

1.4 Case $x = 0$ or $y = 0$: then $xy = 0$, so $|xy| = 0$, and one of $|x|, |y|$ is $0$, whence $|x|\,|y| = 0 = |xy|$. [assume-case zerofactor, L1]

1.5 Case $x, y$ have the same sign (both positive or both negative): by [L4] $xy > 0$, so $|xy| = xy$, while $|x|\,|y| = xy$ by [L3] (for $x, y < 0$ this is $(-x)(-y) = xy$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case same, L1, L3, L4]

1.6 Case $x, y$ have opposite signs (one positive, one negative): by [L4] $xy < 0$, so $|xy| = -(xy)$, while $|x|\,|y| = -(xy)$ by [L3] (namely $x(-y)$ or $(-x)y$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case opposite, L1, L3, L4]

2.1 By trichotomy [L2] each $x$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.1-1.3, and in each we verified $|x| \ge 0$, that $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$, that $|-x| = |x|$, and that $-|x| \le x \le |x|$; hence all four hold for every $x$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, cases-exhaustive]

2.2 By trichotomy [L2] each pair $x, y$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.4-1.6, and in each $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$ for all $x, y$. [step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6, cases-exhaustive]

3.1 Let $c > 0$: if $|x| < c$ then $-c < -|x| \le x \le |x| < c$ by [step 2.1] and [L2], so $-c < x < c$; conversely if $-c < x < c$ then both $x < c$ and $-x < c$, and since $|x|$ equals $x$ or $-x$ by [L1], we get $|x| < c$, so $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$. [step 2.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $A$
([[def-continuity-real]]) and let $K \subseteq A$ be **nonempty** and compact
([[def-open-cover-r]]). Then $\sup f[K]$ and $\inf f[K]$ exist and are
**attained**: there are $p, q \in K$ with

$$f(q) \;=\; \inf f[K] \;\le\; f(x) \;\le\; \sup f[K] \;=\; f(p) \qquad \text{for every } x \in K .$$

Equivalently, the set $f[K]$ has a maximum and a minimum
([[def-max-min]]), namely $\max f[K] = f(p)$ and $\min f[K] = f(q)$.

**Nonemptiness of $K$ is a hypothesis, not an oversight.** For $K = \varnothing$
the set $f[K]$ is empty, and neither a supremum nor a maximum of the empty set
exists in this library ([[def-complete-ordered-field]] supplies suprema of
nonempty sets bounded above only).

**This theorem is stated twice in this library, on purpose.** Its metric-space
twin is [[thm-extreme-value-metric]], proved from the cover machinery of metric
spaces; the proof below is $\mathbb{R}$-native, running through Heine-Borel for
$\mathbb{R}$ and the order-completeness of $\mathbb{R}$, and it uses no cover
argument beyond the one already spent in
[[thm-continuous-image-of-a-compact-set-r]]. That the two statements are the
same statement in two vocabularies is proved in
[[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]], later on this page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ continuous on $A$, and a nonempty compact set $K \subseteq A$; write $S := f[K]$.

[L1] $S = f[K]$ is compact ([[thm-continuous-image-of-a-compact-set-r]]), and it is nonempty because $K$ is.

[L2] $S$ is bounded: there is a real $M \ge 0$ with $|z| \le M$ for every $z \in S$, so $-M$ is a lower bound and $M$ an upper bound of $S$ ([[cor-boundedness-theorem-r]], [[def-bounded-set]]).

[L3] A compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is closed ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L4] Least upper bounds: a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ bounded above has a supremum ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]); a nonempty subset bounded below has an infimum ([[thm-infimum-property]], [[def-infimum]]).

[L5] Epsilon characterisations: for nonempty $S$ bounded above and $u = \sup S$, every real $\varepsilon > 0$ admits $s \in S$ with $u - \varepsilon < s$; dually for $\ell = \inf S$ there is $s \in S$ with $s < \ell + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-sup-epsilon]], [[lem-inf-epsilon]]).

[L6] Closure: $\overline{S}$ is the set of points every neighbourhood of which meets $S$, and $S$ is closed exactly when $S = \overline{S}$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L7] A maximum of a set is an element of it that bounds it above, and a minimum is an element that bounds it below ([[def-max-min]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L1] the set $S = f[K]$ is nonempty and compact, and by [L2] it is bounded; by [L3] it is closed. [L1, L2, L3]

2.1 By [L4] the supremum $u := \sup S$ and the infimum $\ell := \inf S$ exist. [step 1.1, L4]

3.1 **$u$ is adherent to $S$.** Let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. By [L5] there is $s \in S$ with $u - \varepsilon < s$, and $s \le u < u + \varepsilon$ since $u$ bounds $S$ above; hence $|s - u| < \varepsilon$, that is $s \in N_{\varepsilon}(u) \cap S$. So every neighbourhood of $u$ meets $S$. [step 2.1, L5, L6]

3.2 **$\ell$ is adherent to $S$.** Symmetrically, [L5] gives $s \in S$ with $s < \ell + \varepsilon$, and $\ell \le s$ since $\ell$ bounds $S$ below; hence $s \in N_{\varepsilon}(\ell) \cap S$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$. [step 2.1, L5, L6]

4.1 By [L6] the two steps above say $u \in \overline{S}$ and $\ell \in \overline{S}$; and $S$ is closed by step 1.1, so $\overline{S} = S$ and therefore $u \in S$ and $\ell \in S$. [step 1.1, step 3.1, step 3.2, L6]

5.1 Since $u \in S = f[K]$ there is $p \in K$ with $f(p) = u$, and since $\ell \in S$ there is $q \in K$ with $f(q) = \ell$. [step 4.1, choose]

6.1 For every $x \in K$ the value $f(x)$ lies in $S$, so $\ell \le f(x) \le u$, that is $f(q) \le f(x) \le f(p)$. Hence $u = \sup f[K] = f(p)$ is a maximum of $f[K]$ and $\ell = \inf f[K] = f(q)$ is a minimum of it, both attained at points of $K$. [step 2.1, step 4.1, step 5.1, L7] ∎

## Remarks

- **The two ingredients, kept apart.** Compactness of $K$ enters only through the compactness of the image; order-completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ enters only in the existence of $\sup S$ and $\inf S$. The bridge between them is closedness of $S$: a closed set contains the adherent points of itself, and the supremum of a nonempty bounded set is always adherent to it, by [[lem-sup-epsilon]]. Neither ingredient can be dropped: over $\mathbb{Q}$ the supremum need not exist, and on a noncompact domain the supremum exists and is not attained ([[cex-evt-fails-on-the-open-interval-and-on-the-half-line]]).

- **Attainment is exactly what the epsilon characterisation cannot give on its own.** [[lem-sup-epsilon]] produces points of $S$ arbitrarily close to $\sup S$ for any nonempty bounded $S$; nothing there says one of them equals $\sup S$. What closedness adds is that the limiting value is not lost.

- **The converse.** If every continuous real function on a set $E$ attains a greatest value, then $E$ is compact. That is the content of [[thm-compactness-is-necessary-for-evt-and-uniform-continuity]], which exhibits, for every noncompact $E$, a bounded continuous function on $E$ with no greatest value.

## Statement

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be
continuous on $[a,b]$ ([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-interval]]) and
differentiable at every point of $(a,b)$ as a function on $[a,b]$
([[def-derivative]]), and suppose

$$f(a) \;=\; f(b) .$$

Then there is $c \in (a,b)$ with $f'(c) = 0$.

**Three hypotheses, three different jobs.** Continuity on the **closed**
interval is what the extreme value theorem consumes; differentiability on the
**open** interval is what Fermat's theorem consumes, and it is asked for
nowhere else; and $f(a) = f(b)$ is what forces the extremum inside when neither
extremum is attained in the interior. Continuity at the two endpoints cannot be
dropped, and a false statement later on this page records a witness for that.

**Differentiability is meant with respect to the domain $[a,b]$.** For $c$ in
the open interval that is the same condition as differentiability of any
restriction of $f$ to a subinterval around $c$, since only points near $c$
enter, but the phrase is fixed here so that the citation of
[[thm-fermat-interior-extremum]], whose hypothesis is interiority in the
domain, is exact.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, a function $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable at every point of $(a,b)$, with $f(a) = f(b)$.

[L1] $[a,b]$ is closed ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) and bounded ([[def-interval]], [[def-bounded-set]]), hence compact ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]]); and it is nonempty, since $a \le a \le b$ gives $a \in [a,b]$.

[L2] Extreme value theorem ([[thm-extreme-value-r]]): for $f$ continuous on $A$ and $K \subseteq A$ nonempty and compact there are $p, q \in K$ with $f(q) \le f(x) \le f(p)$ for every $x \in K$, so that $f(p) = \max f[K]$ and $f(q) = \min f[K]$ ([[def-max-min]]).

[L3] Every point of $(a,b)$ is interior to $[a,b]$: for $c$ with $a < c < b$ put $\varepsilon := \min\{c - a,\ b - c\}$, a positive real; every $y$ with $|y - c| < \varepsilon$ satisfies $y > c - \varepsilon \ge a$ and $y < c + \varepsilon \le b$, so $N_{\varepsilon}(c) \subseteq (a,b) \subseteq [a,b]$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-interval]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]).

[L4] A value $f(c)$ that is a greatest value of $f$ over the whole of its domain is a local maximum at $c$, and a least value is a local minimum at $c$ ([[def-local-extremum]], claim 4 of its body).

[L5] Fermat's interior extremum theorem ([[thm-fermat-interior-extremum]]): a local extremum at a point interior to the domain, at which the function is differentiable, forces the derivative there to vanish.

[L6] $(a,b)$ is nonempty when $a < b$, since $a < (a+b)/2 < b$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L7] A constant function $h$ on $[a,b]$ is differentiable at every point $c$ of $[a,b]$ with $h'(c) = 0$: every point of the nondegenerate order-convex set $[a,b]$ is a limit point of it, and the difference quotient of $h$ at $c$ is the constant $0$ on $[a,b] \setminus \{c\}$, whose limit at $c$ is $0$ ([[def-derivative]], [[def-function-limit]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The set $[a,b]$ is nonempty and compact, and $f$ is continuous on it. [L1]

1.2 Since $a < b$, the open interval $(a,b)$ is nonempty; fix $m := (a+b)/2 \in (a,b)$. [L6, choose]

2.1 By [L2], applied with $A := K := [a,b]$, fix $p, q \in [a,b]$ with $f(q) \le f(x) \le f(p)$ for every $x \in [a,b]$. [step 1.1, L2, choose]

3.1 **Case A: at least one of $p, q$ lies in $(a,b)$.** Fix such a point and call it $c$. By [L3] the point $c$ is interior to $[a,b]$, and $f$ is differentiable at $c$ because $c \in (a,b)$. By step 2.1 and [L4], $f$ has a local maximum at $c$ if $c$ is the point $p$, and a local minimum at $c$ if it is the point $q$; either way a local extremum. So [L5] gives $f'(c) = 0$, and $c \in (a,b)$. [step 2.1, L3, L4, L5]

3.2 **Case B: neither $p$ nor $q$ lies in $(a,b)$.** A point of $[a,b]$ outside $(a,b)$ satisfies $a \le x \le b$ and not $a < x < b$, hence equals $a$ or $b$; so $p, q \in \{a, b\}$ and, since $f(a) = f(b)$, both $f(p)$ and $f(q)$ equal $f(a)$. By step 2.1, every $x \in [a,b]$ satisfies $f(a) = f(q) \le f(x) \le f(p) = f(a)$, so $f(x) = f(a)$. Thus $f$ is the constant function with value $f(a)$ on $[a,b]$. [step 2.1]

4.1 In case B, [L7] gives that $f$ is differentiable at every point of $[a,b]$ with derivative $0$; in particular $f'(m) = 0$, and $m \in (a,b)$ by step 1.2. [step 1.2, step 3.2, L7]

5.1 The two cases are exhaustive, since either at least one of $p, q$ lies in $(a,b)$ or neither does. Case A supplies a point $c \in (a,b)$ with $f'(c) = 0$ by step 3.1, and case B supplies the point $m$ by step 4.1. [step 3.1, step 4.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The constant case is not a degenerate nuisance, it is the case where the extremum sits on the boundary.** When $f$ is constant the greatest and least values are attained at the endpoints as well as everywhere else, so nothing forces the extreme value theorem to hand back an interior point; the argument has to produce a point of $(a,b)$ by hand, and any point will do.

- **Why compactness enters at all.** Only through [[thm-extreme-value-r]], and only to know that the greatest and least values are **attained**. A supremum that is not attained is useless here: Fermat's theorem is a statement about a point, not about a bound. That is precisely the hypothesis the companion page's witness removes.

- **Nothing is claimed about how many such $c$ there are, or where.** A single $c$ is produced, and the proof gives no way to locate it; the theorem is an existence statement and is used only as one.
