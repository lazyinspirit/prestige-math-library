## Confirmed fatal defect repaired

The pre-repair display was undefined at n=0 because iota(0)=0, so it did not define the claimed N-indexed sequence.

## Example

Define a sequence $(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ by
$$a_0:=0,\qquad
a_n:=\left(1-\frac2{\iota(n)}\right)^n\quad(n\ge1).$$
Then $a_n\longrightarrow e^{-2}$. The separate value at $n=0$ avoids division
by $\iota(0)=0$; the finitely many remaining initial indices with
nonpositive base do not affect the limit.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The sequence $(a_n)$ defined above.

[L1] The product-limit theorem holds for every real input once $n>|x|$ ([[thm-exponential-product-limit]]).

[L2] Since $e=\exp(1)$, the addition and reciprocal formulas and the definition of negative integer powers give $\exp(-2)=1/\exp(2)=1/(\exp(1)\exp(1))=1/e^2=e^{-2}>0$ ([[def-real-exponential-function-and-e]], [[thm-exponential-addition-formula]], [[cor-exponential-reciprocal-and-positivity]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L3] A sequence and any one of its tails have the same limit ([[lem-limit-of-tail]]).

## Verification

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For every $n>2$, the base is positive and $a_n=(1-2/\iota(n))^n$, so [L1] applies at $x=-2$ and gives $a_n\to\exp(-2)$ on that tail.  [L1]

2.1 By [L3], the whole sequence has the same limit as the tail in step 1.1, and [L2] identifies that limit as $e^{-2}>0$.  [step 1.1, L2, L3] ∎

## Statement

For every real $x$,
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(1+\frac{x}{\iota(n)}\right)^n=\exp(x),$$
with the sequence started after $n>|x|$, so the base is positive.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real $x$.

[L1] The binomial theorem expands the product. For fixed $k$, [[lem-scaled-binomial-coefficients-converge]] gives both convergence of the scaled coefficient to $1/\iota(k!)$ and, whenever $n\ge\max\{1,k\}$, the bound $0\le\iota\binom nk/\iota(n)^k\le1/\iota(k!)$ ([[thm-binomial-theorem]]).

[L2] The exponential series converges absolutely ([[lem-exponential-series-has-infinite-radius]], [[def-real-exponential-function-and-e]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For $n>|x|$, the binomial theorem gives $(1+x/\iota(n))^n=\sum_{k=0}^{n}\bigl(\iota\binom nk/\iota(n)^k\bigr)x^k$.  [L1]

1.2 Each fixed coefficient tends to $1/\iota(k!)$, while the uniform bound in [L1] holds for every term present in the sum.  [L1]

2.1 Given $\varepsilon>0$, choose $K$ so the absolute exponential tail after $K$ is below $\varepsilon/3$ using [L2]. The same coefficient bound controls the product tail uniformly in $n$; for the finite head $k\le K$, choose $n$ so all coefficient errors sum to below $\varepsilon/3$.  [step 1.2, L2, choose]

3.1 The triangle inequality then makes the product differ from $\sum_{k\ge0}x^k/\iota(k!)=\exp(x)$ by less than $\varepsilon$.   [step 1.1, step 2.1, given] ∎

## Definition

For $x\in\mathbb R$, define
$$\exp(x):=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^n}{\iota(n!)}, \qquad e:=\exp(1),$$
provided by the all-real convergence proved in [[lem-exponential-series-has-infinite-radius]]. Here $n!\in\mathbb N$ is the factorial of [[def-factorial-and-falling-factorial]], $\iota(n!)$ is its nonzero real image ([[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]), and powers and series are those of [[def-integer-power]] and [[def-series]].

This is a real power series centred at $0$ ([[def-real-power-series-and-radius-of-convergence]]). No logarithm, irrational power, or differential equation enters the definition.

## Statement

For all real $x,y$,
$$\exp(x+y)=\exp(x)\exp(y).$$

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $x,y\in\mathbb R$.

[L1] For fixed $x,y$, the auxiliary power series $\sum_{n\ge0}x^nz^n/\iota(n!)$ and $\sum_{n\ge0}y^nz^n/\iota(n!)$ have infinite radius by [[lem-exponential-series-has-infinite-radius]]. Inside their common radius, their product is the Cauchy product of their coefficients ([[lem-cauchy-product-of-real-power-series]]).

[L2] The binomial theorem says $(x+y)^n=\sum_{k=0}^n\iota\binom nk x^ky^{n-k}$ ([[thm-binomial-theorem]], [[def-binomial-coefficient]]).

[L3] For $k\le n$, $\iota\binom nk=\iota(n!)/(\iota(k!)\iota((n-k)!))$ ([[thm-binomial-closed-formula]]). Therefore $1/(\iota(k!)\iota((n-k)!))=\iota\binom nk/\iota(n!)$, with all naturals read in $\mathbb R$ through [[def-canonical-natural]].

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Apply [L1] at the auxiliary value $z=1$. The coefficient of degree $n$ in the resulting Cauchy product for $\exp(x)\exp(y)$ is $\sum_{k=0}^n x^ky^{n-k}/(\iota(k!)\iota((n-k)!))$.   [L1, given]

2.1 Apply [L3] and [L2] to identify this finite sum with $(x+y)^n/\iota(n!)$.  [step 1.1, L2, L3, algebra]

3.1 Summing over $n$ gives the exponential series at $x+y$, hence the formula.  [step 2.1, L1] ∎

## Statement

For every real $x$, $\exp(x)>0$ and
$$\exp(-x)=\frac1{\exp(x)}.$$

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $x\in\mathbb R$.

[L1] $\exp(x+y)=\exp(x)\exp(y)$ ([[thm-exponential-addition-formula]]), and $\exp(0)=1$ from [[def-real-exponential-function-and-e]].

[L2] Every nonzero square in an ordered field is positive ([[lem-of-square-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Setting $y=-x$ in [L1] gives $\exp(x)\exp(-x)=1$, so both factors are nonzero.  [L1, algebra]

2.1 Also $\exp(x)=\exp(x/2)^2$, so it is nonnegative; by step 1.1 and [L2] it is positive.  [L1, L2]

3.1 Dividing the identity in step 1.1 by $\exp(x)$ gives the reciprocal formula.  [step 1.1, algebra] ∎

## Definition

Let $a \in \mathbb{R}$, where $\mathbb{R}$ is the ambient ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]).

**Natural exponents.** By the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) applied to
the set $\mathbb{R}$, the starting element $1$ and the function
$f(x) = x \cdot a$, there is a unique function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$,
written $n \mapsto a^n$, with

$$a^0 = 1, \qquad a^{n+1} = a^n \cdot a \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Thus $a^1 = a$, $a^2 = a \cdot a$, and so on. Note that this is defined for
**every** $a$, including $a = 0$.

**Negative exponents.** If $a \ne 0$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, set

$$a^{-n} := (a^n)^{-1}.$$

**Why that is legitimate.** The right-hand side presupposes that $a^n$ is
invertible, that is, that $a^n \ne 0$. This is a proof obligation and not an
observation, and it is discharged by claim 2 of [[lem-power-laws]]: for $a \ne 0$
in a field, $a^n \ne 0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, proved there by induction on
$n$ from the fact that a field has no zero divisors ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]).
That lemma is a statement *about* the operation introduced here, so it depends on
this definition and is recorded in this item's `justified_by` rather than in its
`deps` (SCHEMA §3). Given $a^n \ne 0$, the value $(a^n)^{-1}$ is a single
well-determined element, because multiplicative inverses in a field are unique
([[lem-of-inverse-unique]]).

**Integer exponents.** Every integer $m$ ([[def-integers]]) is either
$\iota(n)$ or $-\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$, where $\iota$ is the
embedding $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]],
[[def-int-operations]]). This too is a citation and not a slogan: the order on
$\mathbb{Z}$ is total ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), so $m \ge 0$ or $m < 0$; the
image of $\iota$ is exactly the set of nonnegative integers, and each of them is
$\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]); and if $m < 0$ then
$-m > 0$, by compatibility of the order with addition ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]),
so $-m = \iota(n)$ and $m = -\iota(n)$, with $n$ unique because $\iota$ is
injective. The two clauses above therefore define $a^m$ for every
$m \in \mathbb{Z}$ whenever $a \ne 0$, and for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$ for
arbitrary $a$. The clauses are consistent where they overlap: the only overlap is
$m = 0$, where $-\iota(0) = \iota(0)$ and $(a^0)^{-1} = 1^{-1} = 1 = a^0$.

## Remarks

- **The convention $0^0 = 1$ is adopted here**, and it is not a matter of taste
  but of agreement with the recursion above: $a^0 = 1$ is the starting value for
  every $a$, exactly as the empty product is $1$ ([[def-finite-sum]]). This is
  the convention that makes the empty product, the binomial theorem, and
  polynomial notation $\sum_k c_k x^k$ work at $x = 0$ without an exception. The
  competing convention "$0^0$ undefined" belongs to contexts where $x^y$ is
  studied as a function of two *real* variables and one wants continuity, which
  is unavailable and irrelevant here: the exponent in $a^m$ is an integer, never
  a real.
- $0^n = 0$ for every $n \ge 1$, since $0^{n} = 0^{n-1} \cdot 0 = 0$, a product
  with a zero factor ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]); and
  $0^{-n}$ is not defined for $n \ge 1$, since $0$ has no inverse.
- The exponent is an integer and stays an integer. Rational exponents are a
  separate construction resting on the existence of roots
  ([[thm-nth-roots-exist]], [[def-rational-power]]), and real exponents do not
  exist in this library yet ([[rem-real-exponents-deferred]]).
- The laws $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$ are
  proved, not assumed, in [[lem-power-laws]]; the order behaviour of $a \mapsto a^n$
  is [[lem-power-monotone]].

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]), let $x \in \mathbb{R}$,
and for $K \in \mathbb{N}$ let $x^{(K)}$ denote the $K$-th tail, $x^{(K)}_j =
x_{j+K}$. The following are equivalent ([[def-real-limit]]):

1. $(x_k)$ converges to $x$;
2. every tail $x^{(K)}$ converges to $x$;
3. some tail $x^{(K)}$ converges to $x$.

The same three statements with "converges to $x$" replaced by "is Cauchy" are
likewise equivalent. Consequently, if two sequences agree from some index on,
then either both converge to $x$ or neither does, and either both are Cauchy or
neither is.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals, a real $x$, and for each $K \in \mathbb{N}$ the $K$-th tail $x^{(K)}$ defined by $x^{(K)}_j := x_{j+K}$ ([[def-sequence]]).

[L1] Convergence and the Cauchy condition: $(z_k)$ converges to $z$ when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $N$ with $|z_k - z| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge N$, and $(z_k)$ is Cauchy when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $N$ with $|z_k - z_l| < \varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge N$ ([[def-real-limit]]).

[L2] Index arithmetic, first half: $j \ge N$ implies $j + K \ge N + K$, and $N + K \ge N$ ([[def-nat-order]], [[lem-nat-order-add-compatible]]).

[L3] Index arithmetic, second half: every $k \ge N + K$ has the form $k = j + K$ with $j \ge N$. Indeed $N + K \le k$ gives $i$ with $(N+K) + i = k$; put $j := N + i$, so that $j \ge N$ and $j + K = (N+i) + K = N + (i + K) = N + (K + i) = (N+K) + i = k$ ([[def-nat-order]], [[lem-nat-add-associative]], [[lem-nat-add-commutative]]).

[L4] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is reflexive and transitive, so $k \ge N + K \ge N$ gives $k \ge N$; and $j + 0 = j$ for every $j$ ([[thm-nat-linear-order]], [[def-nat-order]], [[def-nat-addition]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 (1) implies (2). Assume $(x_k)$ converges to $x$, let $K \in \mathbb{N}$ be arbitrary and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be rational; take $N$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge N$. For every $j \ge N$ we have $j + K \ge N + K \ge N$, hence $|x^{(K)}_j - x| = |x_{j+K} - x| < \varepsilon$; so $x^{(K)}$ converges to $x$. [assume-hyp, L1, L2, L4]

1.2 (2) implies (3), in both families. The $0$-th tail satisfies $x^{(0)}_j = x_{j+0} = x_j$, so $(x_k)$ is itself one of its own tails; statement (2) quantifies over all tails, so applying it to this one already yields (3). [given, L4]

1.3 (3) implies (1). Assume $x^{(K)}$ converges to $x$ for some fixed $K$, and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be rational; take $N$ with $|x^{(K)}_j - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $j \ge N$. Every $k \ge N + K$ is of the form $j + K$ with $j \ge N$, so $|x_k - x| = |x^{(K)}_j - x| < \varepsilon$; taking $N + K$ as the threshold shows $(x_k)$ converges to $x$. [assume-hyp, L1, L3]

1.4 The Cauchy version of (1) implies (2). Assume $(x_k)$ is Cauchy, fix $K$ and a rational $\varepsilon > 0$, and take $N$ with $|x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge N$. For $i, j \ge N$ both $i + K \ge N$ and $j + K \ge N$, so $|x^{(K)}_i - x^{(K)}_j| = |x_{i+K} - x_{j+K}| < \varepsilon$; so $x^{(K)}$ is Cauchy. [assume-hyp, L1, L2, L4]

1.5 The Cauchy version of (3) implies (1). Assume $x^{(K)}$ is Cauchy and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be rational; take $N$ with $|x^{(K)}_i - x^{(K)}_j| < \varepsilon$ for all $i, j \ge N$. Any $k, l \ge N + K$ are of the form $i + K$ and $j + K$ with $i, j \ge N$, so $|x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon$; so $(x_k)$ is Cauchy. [assume-hyp, L1, L3]

2.1 In each of the two families the cycle (1) implies (2) implies (3) implies (1) is closed, so within each family the three statements are equivalent. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, step 1.4, step 1.5]

3.1 If $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ agree from index $K$ on, then $x^{(K)} = y^{(K)}$ as functions, so by the established equivalence $(x_k)$ converges to $x$ exactly when $y^{(K)}$ does, exactly when $(y_k)$ does, and the same chain applies to the Cauchy condition. [step 2.1, given] ∎

## Remarks

- This is the lemma that makes the word "eventually" usable. Once it is known that finitely many initial terms are irrelevant, a hypothesis of the form "$P(k)$ for all $k$" can everywhere be weakened to "$P(k)$ eventually" ([[def-sequence]]) at the cost of passing to a tail.

- It also settles the bookkeeping question of where the indexing starts. A text that writes $(x_k)_{k \ge 1}$ is describing the first tail of a sequence in the sense used here, and the two have the same limits and the same Cauchy status.

- Boundedness, by contrast, is *not* a tail property in the same trivial way: a tail of a bounded sequence is bounded, and a sequence with a bounded tail is bounded only because the finitely many omitted terms can be absorbed into the bound, which is exactly the argument of [[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]].

## Definition

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]) with additive identity $0_F$ and
multiplicative identity $1_F$. Define
$\iota : \mathbb{N} \to F$ by recursion on $\mathbb{N}$
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[thm-recursion]]):

$$\iota(0) \;:=\; 0_F, \qquad \iota(n+1) \;:=\; \iota(n) + 1_F .$$

$\iota(n)$ is the **canonical natural** of $n$ in $F$. It is also written
$n \cdot 1_F$, and for $n \ge 1$ it is $1_F$ added to itself $n$ times.

**Why the notation is needed at all.** A natural number in this library is a von
Neumann natural, that is a set ([[def-natural-numbers]]), and a set is not an
element of $F$. So $1/n$, $n^{\alpha}$ and $x/n$ are not expressions of $F$ when
$n$ is a natural: what they mean is $1/\iota(n)$, $\iota(n)^{\alpha}$ and
$x/\iota(n)$. The map $\iota$ is what carries a counting number into the field,
and writing it is the whole reason a reader meets $1/\iota(k+1)$ where an
informal text would write $1/(k+1)$.

## Remarks

- **Where the index shift comes from.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
  ([[def-natural-numbers]]) and $\iota(0) = 0_F$, so $1/\iota(k)$ is undefined at
  $k = 0$. A family of reciprocals indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ is therefore written
  over $\iota(k+1)$, which is why the harmonic and telescoping families of this
  library run over $k+1$ rather than over $k$. This is bookkeeping, not a
  restriction: the values are the usual ones.

- **This definition records notation; the arithmetic is proved elsewhere.** That
  $\iota$ is strictly increasing and positive on $n \ge 1$, and that it carries
  sums to sums and products to products, is [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], stated
  for an ordered field. That lemma introduces the same element by the equivalent
  recursion $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, which
  agrees with the definition above because $\iota(1) = \iota(0) + 1_F = 1_F$.
  Nothing here is new mathematics; the definition exists so that the notation has
  a home a reader can look up.

- **The symbol $\iota$ is used in this library for other canonical maps, and this
  definition does not govern them.** It also denotes the canonical field
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to F$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), the isometric
  embedding of a metric space into a completion ([[def-metric-completion]]), and
  an inclusion map $\iota : S \to X$ of a subspace. Each of those is introduced
  where it is used and means something different from the map defined here. What
  the four share is only that each is the canonical map of its situation.

- **Fields, not just ordered fields.** The recursion needs no order, so the
  definition is stated for a field; every use in this library is in an ordered
  field, and the order is what makes $\iota$ injective
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). In a field of positive characteristic $\iota$
  is not injective, which is one reason the injectivity is a lemma rather than
  part of the definition.
