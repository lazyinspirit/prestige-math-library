You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as
an independent adversarial proof-refuter. Return evidence only; Audit-Alpha
alone adjudicates and edits.

## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` proof, actively search for a counterexample. A false
public claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or
materially inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is
nonfatal.

Return no more than 450 words, exactly in this shape:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

For each defect:

```text
FINDING 1
  location: [exact section/fact/step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [exact assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]
```

Always end with:

```text
BOUNDARY: [specific boundary/counterexample checks and disposition]
SOURCES:  [confirm every supplied cited item used by the target was inspected]
CHECKED:  [confirm title, public claim, every numbered step, and Remarks]

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$. Write

$$D \;:=\; \{\, x \in A : f \text{ is discontinuous at } x \,\}, \qquad C \;:=\; A \setminus D$$

([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-classification-of-discontinuities]]). Then:

1. **Pointwise exhaustion.** $D = \{\, x \in A : \omega_f(x) > 0 \,\}$
   ([[def-oscillation]]), and $D$ is the union of the increasing sequence of
   superlevel sets
   $$D \;=\; \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \{\, x \in A : \omega_f(x) \ge 1/\iota(n+1) \,\}$$
   ([[def-canonical-natural]]), whose thresholds are $1, 1/2, 1/3, \dots$.
2. **Descriptive form.** There is an $F_\sigma$ set $F \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and
   a $G_\delta$ set $V \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-f-sigma-g-delta]]) with
   $$D \;=\; A \cap F, \qquad C \;=\; A \cap V, \qquad V = \mathbb{R} \setminus F ,$$
   and $F$ may be taken to be $\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} G_n$ with each $G_n$ a
   closed subset of $\mathbb{R}$ cutting down on $A$ to the $n$-th set of
   claim 1 ([[lem-oscillation-superlevel-sets-are-closed]]).

In particular, when $A = \mathbb{R}$ the discontinuity set $D$ is an $F_\sigma$
subset of $\mathbb{R}$ and the continuity set $C$ is a $G_\delta$ subset, and
claim 1 reads $D = \bigcup_{n} \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : \omega_f(x) \ge 1/\iota(n+1) \,\}$.

**Claim 1 is stated separately because it is what is cited downstream.** The
exhaustion of $D$ by the superlevel sets $\{\omega_f \ge 1/\iota(n+1)\}$ is used
directly wherever a property has to be established one threshold at a time —
[[thm-baire-one-continuity-points]] shows each superlevel set nowhere dense and
concludes that $D$ is meager — and that use needs the identity itself, not only
the descriptive conclusion of claim 2.

**The statement is relative on purpose.** For a general domain $A$ the sets $D$
and $C$ are subsets of $A$, and neither is $F_\sigma$ or $G_\delta$ in
$\mathbb{R}$ in general; what the proof produces are two subsets of $\mathbb{R}$
that cut down to them. The absolute form is stated only for $A = \mathbb{R}$,
which is the case [[thm-continuity-set-realisation]] and
[[cor-no-function-is-continuous-exactly-on-q]] use.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] $f$ is continuous at $c \in A$ if and only if $\omega_f(c) = 0$; and $\omega_f(c) \ge 0$ for every $c \in A$ ([[thm-continuity-iff-oscillation-zero]], [[def-oscillation]], [[def-extended-reals]]).

[L2] For every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a closed $G \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ with $\{x \in A : \omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon\} = A \cap G$ ([[lem-oscillation-superlevel-sets-are-closed]]).

[L3] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $m \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(m) < \eta$, where $\iota(m)$ is the canonical natural of $m$ in $\mathbb{R}$; and $\iota$ is strictly increasing and positive on the naturals $\ge 1$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L4] A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is $F_\sigma$ when it is the union of a sequence of closed sets and $G_\delta$ when it is the intersection of a sequence of open sets; $S$ is $F_\sigma$ if and only if $\mathbb{R} \setminus S$ is $G_\delta$ ([[def-f-sigma-g-delta]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ put $\varepsilon_n := 1/\iota(n+1)$, a positive real since $n + 1 \ge 1$, and let $G_n \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be closed with $\{x \in A : \omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon_n\} = A \cap G_n$. [L2, L3, construct]

1.2 $D = \{\, x \in A : \omega_f(x) > 0 \,\}$: a point $x \in A$ is a discontinuity exactly when $\omega_f(x) \ne 0$, and $\omega_f(x) \ge 0$ always, so exactly when $\omega_f(x) > 0$. [L1]

2.1 $D \subseteq \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} (A \cap G_n)$. Let $x \in D$, so $\omega_f(x) > 0$. If $\omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon_0 = 1$ then $x \in A \cap G_0$. Otherwise $0 < \omega_f(x) < 1$, so $\omega_f(x)$ is a positive real, and there is a natural $m \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(m) < \omega_f(x)$; writing $m = n + 1$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}$ gives $\omega_f(x) > \varepsilon_n$, hence $x \in A \cap G_n$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L3]

2.2 Conversely $\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} (A \cap G_n) \subseteq D$: if $x \in A \cap G_n$ then $\omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon_n > 0$, so $x \in D$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L3]

3.1 Put $F := \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} G_n$, an $F_\sigma$ subset of $\mathbb{R}$ since each $G_n$ is closed and the family is indexed by $\mathbb{N}$. Then $A \cap F = \bigcup_{n} (A \cap G_n) = D$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, L4]

3.2 Claim 1 is proved: $D = \{x \in A : \omega_f(x) > 0\}$ by step 1.2, and $D = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \{x \in A : \omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon_n\}$ by steps 2.1 and 2.2, since $A \cap G_n$ is by step 1.1 exactly the set $\{x \in A : \omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon_n\}$ with $\varepsilon_n = 1/\iota(n+1)$. The union is increasing, since $n \le m$ gives $\iota(n+1) \le \iota(m+1)$ and hence $\varepsilon_m \le \varepsilon_n$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.1, step 2.2, L3]

4.1 Put $V := \mathbb{R} \setminus F$, a $G_\delta$ subset of $\mathbb{R}$. Then $A \cap V = A \setminus (A \cap F) = A \setminus D = C$. [step 3.1, L4]

5.1 Claim 2 is proved by steps 3.1 and 4.1; and for $A = \mathbb{R}$ the two identities read $D = F$ and $C = V$, so $D$ is $F_\sigma$ and $C$ is $G_\delta$ outright. [step 3.1, step 3.2, step 4.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The exhaustion is indexed from $0$ and the thresholds are $1/\iota(n+1)$.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$, so the sequence of thresholds is $1, 1/2, 1/3, \dots$ and never $1/\iota(0)$, which is not defined. Writing the union as $\bigcup_{n \ge 1} \{\omega_f \ge 1/\iota(n)\}$ names the same family; the form above is used because a sequence in this library is a function on $\mathbb{N}$.

- **The converse holds and is proved separately.** Every $G_\delta$ subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is the continuity set of some function $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-continuity-set-realisation]]), so the two classes coincide exactly. What the present theorem contributes is the direction that constrains: no function can have a continuity set that fails to be $G_\delta$, and [[cor-no-function-is-continuous-exactly-on-q]] spends that on $\mathbb{Q}$.

## Statement

Let $F$ be a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and let
$\varepsilon \in F$ with $\varepsilon > 0$. Then there is a natural number
$n \ge 1$ such that

$$\frac{1}{n \cdot 1_F} < \varepsilon ,$$

where $n \cdot 1_F$ is the canonical natural of $F$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]]) and
$1/(n \cdot 1_F)$ is its multiplicative inverse ([[def-field]]). As is standard
we abbreviate $n \cdot 1_F$ to $n$ and write the conclusion $1/n < \varepsilon$.

This is the **reciprocal form** of the Archimedean property.
[[thm-of-archimedean]] on its own delivers only the assertion that the canonical
naturals are cofinal, $x < n \cdot 1_F$; the form actually used in analysis, that
the reciprocals of the naturals get below every positive bound, is the statement
above, and it is recorded separately so that no proof has to reconstruct the
inversion step in passing.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $F$ and an element $\varepsilon \in F$ with $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] Archimedean property: for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Inverses and order: if $a > 0$ then $a^{-1} > 0$, and if $0 < a < b$ then $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Field arithmetic: an element $a$ with $a > 0$ is nonzero by trichotomy, hence has a multiplicative inverse $a^{-1}$, and $(a^{-1})^{-1} = a$ ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Since $\varepsilon > 0$, trichotomy gives $\varepsilon \ne 0$, so $\varepsilon^{-1}$ exists, and $\varepsilon^{-1} > 0$. [given, L2, L3]

2.1 Apply [L1] to $x = \varepsilon^{-1}$: fix a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $\varepsilon^{-1} < n \cdot 1_F$. [step 1.1, L1, choose]

3.1 Chaining the two displayed inequalities gives $0 < \varepsilon^{-1} < n \cdot 1_F$; in particular $n \cdot 1_F > 0$, so $n \cdot 1_F \ne 0$ and $1/(n \cdot 1_F)$ is defined. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L3]

4.1 Apply the second claim of [L2] with $a = \varepsilon^{-1}$ and $b = n \cdot 1_F$: $0 < (n \cdot 1_F)^{-1} < (\varepsilon^{-1})^{-1}$. [step 3.1, L2]

5.1 By [L3], $(\varepsilon^{-1})^{-1} = \varepsilon$, so the natural number $n \ge 1$ fixed in step 2.1 satisfies $1/(n \cdot 1_F) < \varepsilon$, which is the assertion. [step 4.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Monotonicity gives the eventual form for free.** If $m \ge n \ge 1$ then
  $m \cdot 1_F \ge n \cdot 1_F > 0$, because $k \mapsto k \cdot 1_F$ is strictly
  increasing on the naturals $\ge 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]), and so
  $1/(m \cdot 1_F) \le 1/(n \cdot 1_F) < \varepsilon$ by [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]
  again. So the corollary yields not merely one index but a threshold: every
  $m \ge n$ satisfies $1/m < \varepsilon$. That one extra line is what a
  convergence proof needs, and it is left to the caller rather than folded into
  the statement, because the caller usually has a threshold of its own to combine
  it with.

- **Completeness is used only through [[thm-of-archimedean]].** Nothing here
  needs the least-upper-bound property directly. The corollary therefore holds
  verbatim in any Archimedean ordered field, in particular in $\mathbb{Q}$, and
  it fails in a non-Archimedean ordered field, where an infinitesimal
  $\varepsilon > 0$ is below every $1/n$ by construction.

- The equivalence is exact: the reciprocal form implies the cofinal form back
  again, since given $x > 0$ one applies it to $\varepsilon = 1/x$. The two are
  the same property written on the two sides of the inversion, and only the
  direction proved above is used in this library.

## Statement

There is **no** function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ that is continuous at
every rational and discontinuous at every irrational
([[def-continuity-real]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

Equivalently: $\mathbb{Q}$ is not the continuity set of any function
$\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$.

**The contrast with Thomae's function is the point.** There *is* a function
continuous exactly at the irrationals, namely $t$
([[thm-dirichlet-and-thomae-continuity-sets]]), and one might expect the two
arrangements to be symmetric. They are not, because the classes $F_\sigma$ and
$G_\delta$ are exchanged by complementation while $\mathbb{Q}$ and the
irrationals are, and only one of the two sets is $G_\delta$
([[cor-q-is-meager-and-not-g-delta]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $\mathbb{Q}$ denotes the canonical copy of the rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L1] For every $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ the set of points at which $f$ is continuous is a $G_\delta$ subset of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-discontinuity-set-is-f-sigma]], case $A = \mathbb{R}$, [[def-f-sigma-g-delta]]).

[L2] $\mathbb{Q}$ is **not** a $G_\delta$ subset of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[cor-q-is-meager-and-not-g-delta]], claim 3).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that there is $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ continuous at every rational and discontinuous at every irrational. [assume-contra]

2.1 Then the set of continuity points of $f$ is exactly $\mathbb{Q}$: it contains every rational by hypothesis, and it contains no irrational, again by hypothesis. [step 1.1]

3.1 By the $G_\delta$ theorem the set of continuity points of $f$ is a $G_\delta$ subset of $\mathbb{R}$, so $\mathbb{Q}$ is $G_\delta$. This contradicts the fact that $\mathbb{Q}$ is not $G_\delta$, so no such $f$ exists. [step 2.1, L1, L2, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the work actually is.** Nothing in this corollary is hard; all of it
  was done earlier. The $G_\delta$ theorem is [[thm-discontinuity-set-is-f-sigma]],
  which rests on the oscillation, and the failure of $\mathbb{Q}$ to be
  $G_\delta$ is [[cor-q-is-meager-and-not-g-delta]], which is where the Baire
  category theorem is spent. The corollary is the place where those two meet.

- **A weaker statement is true and much cheaper, and is not what is proved
  here.** That no *monotone* function is continuous exactly at the rationals
  follows from [[thm-froda]] alone, since the irrationals are uncountable. The
  statement above is about all functions and needs category.

## Definition

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]) with additive identity $0_F$ and
multiplicative identity $1_F$. Define
$\iota : \mathbb{N} \to F$ by recursion on $\mathbb{N}$
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[thm-recursion]]):

$$\iota(0) \;:=\; 0_F, \qquad \iota(n+1) \;:=\; \iota(n) + 1_F .$$

$\iota(n)$ is the **canonical natural** of $n$ in $F$. It is also written
$n \cdot 1_F$, and for $n \ge 1$ it is $1_F$ added to itself $n$ times.

**Why the notation is needed at all.** A natural number in this library is a von
Neumann natural, that is a set ([[def-natural-numbers]]), and a set is not an
element of $F$. So $1/n$, $n^{\alpha}$ and $x/n$ are not expressions of $F$ when
$n$ is a natural: what they mean is $1/\iota(n)$, $\iota(n)^{\alpha}$ and
$x/\iota(n)$. The map $\iota$ is what carries a counting number into the field,
and writing it is the whole reason a reader meets $1/\iota(k+1)$ where an
informal text would write $1/(k+1)$.

## Remarks

- **Where the index shift comes from.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
  ([[def-natural-numbers]]) and $\iota(0) = 0_F$, so $1/\iota(k)$ is undefined at
  $k = 0$. A family of reciprocals indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ is therefore written
  over $\iota(k+1)$, which is why the harmonic and telescoping families of this
  library run over $k+1$ rather than over $k$. This is bookkeeping, not a
  restriction: the values are the usual ones.

- **This definition records notation; the arithmetic is proved elsewhere.** That
  $\iota$ is strictly increasing and positive on $n \ge 1$, and that it carries
  sums to sums and products to products, is [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], stated
  for an ordered field. That lemma introduces the same element by the equivalent
  recursion $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, which
  agrees with the definition above because $\iota(1) = \iota(0) + 1_F = 1_F$.
  Nothing here is new mathematics; the definition exists so that the notation has
  a home a reader can look up.

- **The symbol $\iota$ is used in this library for other canonical maps, and this
  definition does not govern them.** It also denotes the canonical field
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to F$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), the isometric
  embedding of a metric space into a completion ([[def-metric-completion]]), and
  an inclusion map $\iota : S \to X$ of a subspace. Each of those is introduced
  where it is used and means something different from the map defined here. What
  the four share is only that each is the canonical map of its situation.

- **Fields, not just ordered fields.** The recursion needs no order, so the
  definition is stated for a field; every use in this library is in an ordered
  field, and the order is what makes $\iota$ injective
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). In a field of positive characteristic $\iota$
  is not injective, which is one reason the injectivity is a lemma rather than
  part of the definition.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Then
$f$ is **discontinuous at $c$**, and $c$ is a **discontinuity of $f$**, when $f$
is not continuous at $c$ ([[def-continuity-real]]). As in
[[def-one-sided-limits]] write

$$A^{-} := A \cap (-\infty, c), \qquad A^{+} := A \cap (c, \infty)$$

([[def-interval]]), and recall that $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x)$ is defined only
when $c$ is a limit point of $A^{-}$, and $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$ only when
$c$ is a limit point of $A^{+}$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]).

**At an isolated point there is nothing to classify.** If $c$ is an isolated
point of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so that $A \cap N_{\rho}(c) = \{c\}$ for
some real $\rho > 0$, then $f$ is continuous at $c$: the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$
condition of [[def-continuity-real]] is satisfied by $\delta := \rho$, since the
only $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \rho$ is $c$ itself and $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0$. So
every discontinuity is a limit point of $A$, and the classification below covers
every case that occurs.

### Two-sided points

Suppose $c$ is a limit point of **both** $A^{-}$ and $A^{+}$, so that both
one-sided limits are well posed. Say that $c$ is a discontinuity

- **of the first kind** when both one-sided limits exist;
- **of the second kind**, also called **essential**, when at least one of the two
  one-sided limits fails to exist.

A discontinuity of the first kind is further

- **removable** when $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) = \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$; the
  common value is then different from $f(c)$, for otherwise
  [[thm-two-sided-limit-iff-both-one-sided]] would give
  $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$ and $f$ would be continuous at $c$
  ([[def-continuity-real]]);
- a **jump** when $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) \ne \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$; the
  difference $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x) - \lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x)$ is then called
  the **jump of $f$ at $c$**.

The three cases *removable*, *jump*, *essential* are mutually exclusive and
exhaust the two-sided discontinuities of $f$: either both one-sided limits
exist, and then they are equal or not, or one of them does not exist.

**Removable is a name for what can be repaired.** If $c$ is a removable
discontinuity with common one-sided value $L$, then the function agreeing with
$f$ off $c$ and taking the value $L$ at $c$ is continuous at $c$, again by
[[thm-two-sided-limit-iff-both-one-sided]] and [[def-continuity-real]]: changing
the single value $f(c)$ removes the discontinuity. No such repair is available at
a jump or at an essential discontinuity, since there the two-sided limit does not
exist at all and no choice of value at $c$ can create it.

### One-sided points

If $c$ is a limit point of exactly one of $A^{-}$ and $A^{+}$, only that side is
defined and only that side is used: $c$ is a discontinuity **of the first kind**
when the one-sided limit on the side in question exists, and **of the second
kind** otherwise. When it exists it is different from $f(c)$, since on such a
point the one-sided condition and the continuity condition are the same
condition; and there is no jump case, there being nothing to compare the value
with. The endpoints of an interval are the typical instance.

**On the two vocabularies.** *First kind* and *second kind* are Rudin's terms and
are recorded because the literature uses them; *removable*, *jump* and
*essential* are the names used in the rest of this library. They name the same
three cases and no third classification is introduced.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field with its order and
absolute value ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]), and
neighbourhoods are those of [[def-neighbourhood-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Then
$f$ is **continuous at $c$** when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

with $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ ranging over the **positive reals**. In the
language of neighbourhoods: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ with

$$f\bigl(A \cap N_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \;\subseteq\; N_{\varepsilon}\bigl(f(c)\bigr).$$

$f$ is **continuous on $A$** when it is continuous at every point of $A$.

**The point $c$ is required to lie in $A$, and the condition is unpunctured.**
Both differ from [[def-function-limit]], and deliberately. There the quantifier
runs over $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, which removes $x = c$; here $x = c$ is allowed,
and at $x = c$ the implication reads $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$, which is
automatic. So allowing $x = c$ costs nothing, and it is what lets the definition
be stated at every point of $A$, including the points where no limit exists.

**Three clauses, and all three are part of the definition.**

1. **At a limit point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is a limit point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]). Then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if the
   limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) \;=\; f(c)$$
   ([[def-function-limit]]). Indeed, for a given $\varepsilon > 0$ a $\delta$
   witnessing continuity witnesses the limit condition, because the limit
   condition quantifies over a subset of the points continuity quantifies over;
   and conversely a $\delta$ witnessing $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$ witnesses
   continuity, because the one point it omits, $x = c$, satisfies
   $|f(c) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ anyway.

2. **At an isolated point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is an isolated point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so that $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ for some real
   $\eta > 0$. Then **every** $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$: take
   $\delta := \eta$, so that the only $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ is $c$
   itself, and $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$.

3. **On a set.** Continuity on $A$ is continuity at each point of $A$, and
   nothing more. It is not a condition relating $f$ to points outside $A$.

Every point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$,
and never both ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so clauses 1 and 2 between them describe
continuity at every point of $A$.

**This is not the raw $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula of
[[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]].** That item records what goes
wrong when the *punctured* formula of [[def-function-limit]] is written down at
an arbitrary point of the domain: at an isolated point it is satisfied
vacuously by every real $L$ at once, so it defines nothing, and this library
therefore leaves $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ **undefined** at an isolated point.
Continuity at an isolated point is a different matter: the formula above is not
vacuous — it is a genuine condition on $f(c)$, satisfied because $f(c)$ is the
only value being compared with itself — and it names a single, well-defined
property. The limit is undefined there; the continuity is defined, and is
automatic. Clause 1 is the only place where the two notions meet, and it is
stated only where the limit exists as a notion.

**Where the distinction disappears.** If $A$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), then every $c \in A$ has some
$N_{\eta}(c) \subseteq A$, and a punctured neighbourhood is never empty
([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), so every point of $A$ is a limit point of $A$ and
clause 1 covers the whole of $A$. The same holds when $A$ is a nondegenerate
interval ([[def-interval]]). Isolated points are what force clause 2 to exist at
all, and they occur as soon as $A$ is allowed to be an arbitrary subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, as in $A = \{0\} \cup [1,2]$.

## Remarks

- **Continuity is local.** If $\eta > 0$ and $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agrees with
  $f$ on $A \cap N_{\eta}(c)$, then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if $g$
  is: any $\delta$ may be replaced by $\min\{\delta, \eta\}$, after which the
  condition only ever evaluates the two functions where they agree. So
  continuity at $c$ sees only an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of $c$, exactly
  as the limit does ([[lem-limit-is-local]]).

- **Continuity passes to subsets of the domain.** If $B \subseteq A$ and
  $c \in B$, then continuity of $f$ at $c$ gives continuity of the restriction
  $f|_B$ at $c$, with the same $\delta$: the condition on $f|_B$ quantifies over
  fewer points. The converse fails, and the standard witness is the indicator of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ restricted to $\mathbb{Q}$, which is constant and hence
  continuous, while the indicator itself is continuous nowhere
  ([[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]]).

- **The radius is a real number.** As in [[def-neighbourhood-r]], $\varepsilon$
  and $\delta$ range over the positive reals here. Restricting either quantifier
  to the positive rationals defines the same relation, by the passage recorded
  in [[def-function-limit]]: below every positive real lies a positive rational
  ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and a real $\delta$ may be shrunk to a rational
  one below it.

- **The word *continuous* is used for two things in this library, and they
  agree.** [[def-metric-continuity]] defines continuity of a map between metric
  spaces, and $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ carries the metric $d(x,y) = |x-y|$. The
  two notions coincide, and that is proved, not assumed:
  [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]] is the dictionary, and it is stated on
  this page precisely so that no later item has to guess.

## Definition

Fix two objects $-\infty$ and $+\infty$, distinct from one another and neither of
them a real number ([[def-real-numbers]]), and set

$$\overline{\mathbb{R}} := \mathbb{R} \cup \{-\infty, +\infty\}.$$

This is a **new object**, introduced here explicitly with its own order and its
own partial arithmetic. It is not an enlargement of the field $\mathbb{R}$, and
no operation of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) is redefined by
anything below.

**The order.** For $a, b \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ declare

$$a \le b \quad :\Longleftrightarrow \quad a = -\infty \ \text{ or } \ b = +\infty \ \text{ or } \ \big(a, b \in \mathbb{R} \text{ and } a \le b \text{ in } \mathbb{R}\big),$$

with $\mathbb{R}$ ordered as in [[def-real-order]], and write $a < b$ for
"$a \le b$ and $a \ne b$" as usual ([[def-partial-order]]).

**$(\overline{\mathbb{R}}, \le)$ is a totally ordered set, and the inclusion of
$\mathbb{R}$ preserves and reflects the order.** All four checks are immediate
from the displayed clauses.

- *Reflexive.* For $a = \pm\infty$ one of the first two clauses applies; for
  $a \in \mathbb{R}$ the third does, since $a \le a$ in $\mathbb{R}$.
- *Antisymmetric.* Suppose $a \le b$ and $b \le a$. If $a = -\infty$ then
  $b \le a$ forces $b = -\infty$, since the clause $a = +\infty$ fails and $b, a$
  are not both real. Symmetrically $b = -\infty$ forces $a = -\infty$, and
  $a = +\infty$ or $b = +\infty$ forces the other to be $+\infty$. In the one
  remaining situation $a$ and $b$ are both real and antisymmetry is that of
  $\mathbb{R}$.
- *Transitive.* Let $a \le b \le c$. If $a = -\infty$ or $c = +\infty$ the
  conclusion is one of the first two clauses. Otherwise $a \ne -\infty$ forces,
  in $a \le b$, either $b = +\infty$ or $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$; and $c \ne +\infty$
  forces, in $b \le c$, either $b = -\infty$ or $b, c \in \mathbb{R}$. The value
  $b = +\infty$ is incompatible with the second alternative pair, so $b$ is real,
  hence so are $a$ and $c$, and transitivity is that of $\mathbb{R}$.
- *Total.* If $a = -\infty$ or $b = +\infty$ then $a \le b$; if $b = -\infty$ or
  $a = +\infty$ then $b \le a$; otherwise both are real and the order of
  $\mathbb{R}$ is total.
- *Preserved and reflected.* For $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ the first two clauses fail,
  so $a \le b$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ says exactly $a \le b$ in $\mathbb{R}$.

In particular $-\infty$ is the least and $+\infty$ the greatest element of
$\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, and $-\infty < x < +\infty$ for every $x \in \mathbb{R}$.

**Reflection.** Extend negation by

$$-(+\infty) := -\infty, \qquad -(-\infty) := +\infty,$$

keeping the field negative on $\mathbb{R}$. The resulting map
$\nu : \overline{\mathbb{R}} \to \overline{\mathbb{R}}$, $\nu(a) = -a$, satisfies
$\nu(\nu(a)) = a$ and

$$a \le b \iff -b \le -a \qquad (a, b \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}).$$

For $a$ and $b$ real this is the elementwise order reversal in $\mathbb{R}$:
translation invariance ([[lem-of-add-order]]) applied with the constant $-a-b$
turns $a < b$ into $-b < -a$ and, applied with the constant $a+b$, turns it back,
while $a = b$ holds exactly when $-a = -b$. In every other case both sides are
decided by the first two clauses of the order: $a = -\infty$ makes both sides
true, as does $b = +\infty$, and if $a \ne -\infty$, $b \ne +\infty$ and $a, b$
are not both real then one of $a = +\infty$, $b = -\infty$ holds and both sides
are false.

**Partial addition.** For $a, b \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ the sum $a + b$ is
defined by

- $a + b$ = the field sum, when $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$;
- $a + b := +\infty$ when $a = +\infty$ and $b \ne -\infty$, or $b = +\infty$ and $a \ne -\infty$;
- $a + b := -\infty$ when $a = -\infty$ and $b \ne +\infty$, or $b = -\infty$ and $a \ne +\infty$;

and **the two sums $(+\infty) + (-\infty)$ and $(-\infty) + (+\infty)$ are left
undefined**. Addition is commutative where defined, and

$$-(a + b) = (-a) + (-b),$$

each side being defined exactly when the other is: the excluded pairs
$\{+\infty, -\infty\}$ are exchanged by $\nu$, and the three clauses above are
exchanged accordingly.

**Partial multiplication.** For $a, b \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ the product $ab$
is defined by

- $ab$ = the field product, when $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$;
- $ab := +\infty$ when one of $a, b$ is $\pm\infty$, the other is $\ne 0$, and both are $> 0$ or both are $< 0$;
- $ab := -\infty$ when one of $a, b$ is $\pm\infty$, the other is $\ne 0$, and one is $> 0$ and the other $< 0$;

and **every product with one factor $0$ and the other $\pm\infty$ is left
undefined**. The comparisons $> 0$ and $< 0$ here are taken in the order above,
under which $+\infty > 0 > -\infty$.

**Nothing else is defined.** There is no subtraction, no division, no
exponentiation and no absolute value on $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ in this library;
where such an expression is wanted it is written out in the two defined
operations, and where a case falls in the undefined list the statement carries an
explicit hypothesis saying so.

## Remarks

- **$\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is not a field, and not an ordered field.** It has no
  additive inverse for $+\infty$: $(+\infty) + b$ is $+\infty$ whenever it is
  defined and is never $0$. So none of the field axioms
  ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) is available here, and no algebraic
  manipulation valid in $\mathbb{R}$ may be transported to
  $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ without a separate justification.

- **Why the excluded cases are excluded.** The three defined clauses of each
  operation are exactly the cases in which the value is forced by the limiting
  behaviour of the sequences involved, and the excluded cases are exactly the
  ones in which it is not. For the product this is proved on the companion page:
  [[cex-zero-times-infinity-indeterminate]] exhibits a null sequence and two
  sequences diverging to $+\infty$ whose products behave differently, so no value
  assigned to $0 \cdot (+\infty)$ could be compatible with products of limits.
  The same phenomenon rules out a value for $(+\infty) + (-\infty)$: with
  $a_k = k$ and $b_k = -k$ the sum is constantly $0$, while with $b_k = -2k$ it
  diverges to $-\infty$. Leaving them undefined is not squeamishness, it is the
  only option that keeps every later statement about limits true without a
  side condition hidden inside the arithmetic.

- **This is the separate introduction that [[rem-sup-conventions]] points to.**
  That remark refuses the conventions $\sup S = +\infty$ and
  $\inf \emptyset = +\infty$ inside $\mathbb{R}$, and records that the extended
  real line is introduced explicitly here, with its own order and its own partial
  arithmetic kept separate from $\mathbb{R}$ rather than quietly extending it.
  This is that introduction. The suprema and infima of [[def-complete-ordered-field]],
  [[def-infimum]] and the whole suprema page remain real numbers with their
  nonempty and bounded hypotheses intact; what is new is a *separate* supremum
  operation, taken in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ and named as such, supplied by
  [[lem-extended-reals-complete]].

- **The symbols were already in circulation, and this definition does not change
  what they meant.** [[def-divergence-to-infinity]] defines the single phrase
  "$x_k \to +\infty$" as an abbreviation for a condition on $(x_k)$, and says in
  as many words that it does not define an object named $+\infty$. That reading
  is still correct: nothing in [[def-divergence-to-infinity]] is restated or
  reinterpreted here, and [[def-extended-limits]] is where the two are related, by
  a definition that quotes the old one rather than replacing it. Likewise the
  interval notation $(a, \infty)$ of [[def-interval]] is notation for a condition
  on one side, not an endpoint, and stays that way.

- **Why the order is defined by three clauses rather than by a picture.** The
  clauses are what the verifications above actually use, and they make the two
  facts that later proofs lean on immediate: every element is $\le +\infty$ and
  every element is $\ge -\infty$, with no case analysis at the point of use.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with open and closed sets as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

- $A$ is an **$F_\sigma$ set** when there is a sequence $(F_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$
  of closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ with
  $$A \;=\; \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} F_n .$$
- $A$ is a **$G_\delta$ set** when there is a sequence $(V_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$
  of open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ with
  $$A \;=\; \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} V_n .$$

The letters are the traditional ones: $F$ for *fermé* with $\sigma$ for *somme*,
$G$ for *Gebiet* with $\delta$ for *Durchschnitt*.

**The two classes are exchanged by complementation.** $A$ is $F_\sigma$ if and
only if $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ is $G_\delta$. If $A = \bigcup_n F_n$ with each
$F_n$ closed, then $\mathbb{R} \setminus A = \bigcap_n (\mathbb{R} \setminus F_n)$
by De Morgan, and each $\mathbb{R} \setminus F_n$ is open by the definition of
closedness ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]); the converse is the same computation
read backwards, using that the complement of an open set is closed, which is
again [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

**Every closed set is $F_\sigma$ and every open set is $G_\delta$**, by the
constant sequence $F_n := A$, respectively $V_n := A$. As with
[[def-nowhere-dense-meager]], an at most countable family ([[def-countable]]) may
always be presented as a sequence: a finite list $F_0, \dots, F_m$ of closed sets
is extended by $F_n := F_m$ for $n > m$, and a finite list of open sets likewise,
so nothing is lost by indexing over $\mathbb{N}$.

## Remarks

- **The classes are genuinely larger than the closed and the open sets.**
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is $F_\sigma$ and is neither open nor closed, and the irrationals
  are $G_\delta$ and neither open nor closed; both computations are in
  [[cor-q-is-meager-and-not-g-delta]]. That $\mathbb{Q}$ is not also $G_\delta$
  is the first genuinely hard fact about these classes and needs the Baire
  category theorem ([[thm-baire-category-r]]).

- **Why the algebra of open sets is not enough.** [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]
  gives that a *finite* intersection of open sets is open and a *finite* union of
  closed sets is closed. The definitions above are exactly what one gets by
  relaxing "finite" to "countable" once, and the point of the whole notion is
  that the relaxation is proper: a countable intersection of open sets need not
  be open, which is [[cex-intersection-of-shrinking-intervals-not-open]].

- **Nothing here is a measure-theoretic notion.** $F_\sigma$ and $G_\delta$ are
  defined from the topology of $\mathbb{R}$ alone and are used on this page to
  say precisely how far $\mathbb{Q}$ and its complement sit from being closed or
  open. They cut across [[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]] completely:
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is $F_\sigma$ and has measure zero
  ([[lem-countable-sets-are-null]]), while the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set is
  closed, hence $F_\sigma$, and does not
  ([[thm-fat-cantor-set-has-positive-measure]]).

## Definition

Let $U, F \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]].

- $U$ is **open** when for every $x \in U$ there is a real $\varepsilon > 0$
  with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$.
- $F$ is **closed** when its complement $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open.
- A set is **clopen** when it is both open and closed.

The whole of the topology of $\mathbb{R}$ developed on this page rests on this
one definition: closedness is *defined* as openness of the complement, and every
other description of a closed set on this page is a theorem
([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]]).

**$\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen.** The condition defining openness
quantifies over the elements of the set, so it holds vacuously for
$\varnothing$; and for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ one has $N_1(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$,
so $\mathbb{R}$ is open. Since each of the two is the complement of the other,
each is also closed.

**Every neighbourhood is open.** Let $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and put
$\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x|$, which is $> 0$ because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$. The nesting property of [[def-neighbourhood-r]] gives
$N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$. So every point of $N_\varepsilon(x)$
has a neighbourhood inside it.

**The four open forms of [[def-interval]] are open sets.** Let $a, b \in
\mathbb{R}$.

- $(a,b)$: for $x$ with $a < x < b$, both $x - a > 0$ and $b - x > 0$, so
  $\delta := \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ is a positive real (the minimum of a
  two-element set of reals exists, [[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).
  If $|y - x| < \delta$ then $y > x - \delta \ge x - (x - a) = a$ and
  $y < x + \delta \le x + (b - x) = b$, so $y \in (a,b)$; hence
  $N_\delta(x) \subseteq (a,b)$.
- $(a,\infty)$: for $x > a$ take $\delta := x - a > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y > x - \delta = a$.
- $(-\infty,b)$: for $x < b$ take $\delta := b - x > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y < x + \delta = b$.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: already treated above.

**The four closed forms of [[def-interval]] are closed sets.** In each case the
complement is shown open directly.

- $[a,b]$: if $x \notin [a,b]$ then $x < a$ or $x > b$ by trichotomy
  ([[def-ordered-field]]). If $x < a$, take $\delta := a - x > 0$; every
  $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has $y < x + \delta = a$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. If
  $x > b$, take $\delta := x - b > 0$; every $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has
  $y > x - \delta = b$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. So
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus [a,b]$ is open.
- $[a,\infty)$: its complement is $(-\infty,a)$, which is open by the previous
  paragraph.
- $(-\infty,b]$: its complement is $(b,\infty)$, which is open.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: its complement is $\varnothing$, which is
  open.

## Remarks

- **Open and closed are not opposites, and not exhaustive.** A set may be
  neither: the half-open interval $[0,1)$ is neither open nor closed
  ([[fs-every-set-is-open-or-closed]]). A set may be both: $\varnothing$ and
  $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen. The words are inherited from the interval terminology
  of [[def-interval]], and the agreement between the two usages is exactly the
  two lists verified above: an interval called open there is an open set here,
  and an interval called closed there is a closed set here.

- **A clopen set is a disconnection waiting to happen.** If $A$ is clopen and
  both $A$ and $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ are nonempty, then each of the two is
  its own closure, so the two are separated in the sense of
  [[def-connected-r]] and $\mathbb{R} = A \cup (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)$ is a
  disconnection. Since $\mathbb{R}$ is order-convex it is connected
  ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]]), so no such $A$ exists:
  $\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are the only clopen subsets of $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The half-open forms are the ones the two lists omit**, and deliberately so:
  $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ with $a < b$ are neither open nor closed as subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The radius depends on the point.** Openness asks for *some* $\varepsilon$
  at each point, and that $\varepsilon$ may shrink to nothing as the point
  approaches the edge of the set, as the computation for $(a,b)$ shows: there
  $\delta = \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ tends to $0$ as $x$ tends to either endpoint.
  Asking instead for a single $\varepsilon$ that works simultaneously at every
  point of the set is a strictly stronger condition, and it is not what is
  defined here; nothing on this page uses it.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$. All suprema and
infima below are taken in the extended real line
$\overline{\mathbb{R}} = \mathbb{R} \cup \{-\infty, +\infty\}$
([[def-extended-reals]]), where **every** subset has a least upper bound and a
greatest lower bound ([[lem-extended-reals-complete]]); no boundedness
hypothesis on $f$ is therefore needed anywhere, and none is imposed.

**Oscillation on a set.** For $S \subseteq A$ put

$$\omega_f(S) \;:=\; \sup\{\, |f(x) - f(y)| \;:\; x, y \in S \,\} \;\in\; \overline{\mathbb{R}} .$$

**Oscillation at a point.** For $c \in A$ put

$$\omega_f(c) \;:=\; \inf\{\, \omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c)) \;:\; \delta \in \mathbb{R},\ \delta > 0 \,\} \;\in\; \overline{\mathbb{R}},$$

where $N_\delta(c) = (c - \delta, c + \delta)$ is the $\delta$-neighbourhood of
$c$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

The two uses of the symbol $\omega_f$ are distinguished by their argument: a
subset of $A$ in the first, a point of $A$ in the second. Where confusion is
possible the first is written $\omega_f(S)$ with $S$ named as a set.

### Both values are well posed; point oscillation and nonempty-set oscillation are nonnegative

**The set in the first display is nonempty whenever $S$ is**, since $x = y \in S$
gives the value $|f(x) - f(x)| = 0$; so $\omega_f(S) \ge 0$ for nonempty $S$,
and $\omega_f(S) = \sup \varnothing = -\infty$ for $S = \varnothing$
([[lem-extended-reals-complete]]). Only nonempty $S$ occurs below.

**The set in the second display is nonempty**, since some real $\delta > 0$
exists, and each of its members is $\ge 0$: for $c \in A$ the set
$A \cap N_\delta(c)$ contains $c$ itself, because $|c - c| = 0 < \delta$, so it
is nonempty and $\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c)) \ge 0$
([[lem-of-abs-value]]). Hence $0$ is a lower bound of that set and

$$0 \;\le\; \omega_f(c) \;\le\; \omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c)) \qquad \text{for every real } \delta > 0,$$

the second inequality because $\omega_f(c)$ is a lower bound of the set of which
$\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c))$ is a member. In particular $\omega_f(c)$ is never
$-\infty$.

### Monotonicity, and the case of a bounded $f$

**$\omega_f$ is monotone under inclusion.** If $S \subseteq T \subseteq A$ then
every value $|f(x) - f(y)|$ with $x, y \in S$ is also a value with $x, y \in T$,
so the first set of values is contained in the second and
$\omega_f(S) \le \omega_f(T)$: a supremum of a subset is at most the supremum of
the set. Consequently $\delta \mapsto \omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c))$ is
nondecreasing in $\delta$, since $\delta \le \delta'$ gives
$N_\delta(c) \subseteq N_{\delta'}(c)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

**When $f$ is bounded, nonempty-set and point oscillations are real.** Suppose
there is a real $M$ with $|f(x)| \le M$ for every $x \in A$
([[def-bounded-set]]). Then for $x, y \in A$,

$$|f(x) - f(y)| \;\le\; |f(x)| + |f(y)| \;\le\; 2M$$

([[lem-of-abs-value]]), so $\omega_f(S) \le 2M$ for every $S \subseteq A$. If
$S$ is nonempty, $\omega_f(S)$ is a real number in $[0,2M]$, and every point
oscillation is also a real number in $[0,2M]$: the supremum of a nonempty
subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$ is the real
supremum ([[lem-extended-reals-complete]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]],
[[def-infimum]]). The convention $\omega_f(\varnothing)=-\infty$ remains the
single empty-set exception. Apart from that exception, an infinite extended
value can occur only when $f$ is unbounded.

**The notation.** The letter is $\omega$ throughout this library, never
"$\operatorname{osc}$", and the function is always in the subscript.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field, with field structure as in [[def-field]], and for
$n \ge 1$ let $n \cdot 1_F$ denote the canonical natural number
$\underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$, defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$
and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$. Then for every $n \ge 1$:

- $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$;
- the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$;
- $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ and $(mn) \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F)$ for all $m, n \ge 1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ whose canonical naturals are defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, with $0 \cdot 1_F = 0$.

[L1] $0 < 1_F$ in every ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] The order is compatible with addition and positives are closed under addition: $a < b$ implies $a + c < b + c$, and $a > 0$, $b > 0$ imply $a + b > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 1$: by definition $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, and $1_F > 0$. [L1, base]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: assume $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for some fixed $n \ge 1$. [ih]

1.3 By the recursion, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F - n \cdot 1_F = 1_F > 0$, so $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$. [given, L1]

1.4 Additive identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ by the recursion, and if $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ then $(m+n+1) \cdot 1_F = (m+n) \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + (n+1) \cdot 1_F$. [given, algebra]

2.1 Inductive step: $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ is a sum of two positives, by the hypothesis and $1_F > 0$, hence $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Iterating 1.3, for $m < n$ one has $m \cdot 1_F < n \cdot 1_F$, so $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing and therefore injective on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$. [step 1.3, L2]

2.3 Multiplicative identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m \cdot 1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(1 \cdot 1_F)$, and the step $(m(n+1)) \cdot 1_F = (mn + m) \cdot 1_F = (mn) \cdot 1_F + m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F) + (m \cdot 1_F)(1_F) = (m \cdot 1_F)((n+1) \cdot 1_F)$ uses 1.4 and distributivity. [step 1.4, algebra]

3.1 By induction on 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for every $n \ge 1$; with the strict increase 2.2 and the identities 1.4, 2.3, every claim holds. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 1.4, step 2.3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let
$\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\varepsilon > 0$. Put

$$E_\varepsilon \;:=\; \{\, x \in A : \omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon \,\}$$

([[def-oscillation]]). Then there is a **closed** $G \subseteq \mathbb{R}$
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) with

$$E_\varepsilon \;=\; A \cap G .$$

In particular, if $A = \mathbb{R}$ then $E_\varepsilon$ is itself a closed
subset of $\mathbb{R}$.

**The set $G$ is produced explicitly and does not depend on any choice**: it is
the complement of

$$U \;:=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : \omega_f(A \cap N_\rho(y)) < \varepsilon \ \text{ for some real } \rho > 0 \,\},$$

which the proof shows to be open. Note that $y$ ranges over all of $\mathbb{R}$
here and not only over $A$; the expression $\omega_f(A \cap N_\rho(y))$ is the
oscillation of $f$ on a subset of $A$ and makes sense for every real $y$, taking
the value $\sup \varnothing = -\infty$ when $A \cap N_\rho(y) = \varnothing$
([[def-oscillation]], [[lem-extended-reals-complete]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$, and a real $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] $\omega_f(S) = \sup\{|f(x) - f(y)| : x, y \in S\}$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, and $\omega_f(S) \le \omega_f(T)$ whenever $S \subseteq T \subseteq A$; for $c \in A$, $\omega_f(c) = \inf\{\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c)) : \delta > 0\}$ ([[def-oscillation]], [[def-extended-reals]]).

[L2] In $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ every subset has a greatest lower bound; an infimum is $\ge$ an extended real $\ell$ exactly when $\ell$ bounds the set from below, and the infimum is $\le$ every member of the set ([[lem-extended-reals-complete]]).

[L3] $N_\delta(x) = \{y : |y - x| < \delta\}$; if $|y - x| < \rho/2$ then $N_{\rho/2}(y) \subseteq N_\rho(x)$, since $|z - y| < \rho/2$ gives $|z - x| \le |z - y| + |y - x| < \rho$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L4] $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is open when every point of $U$ has a neighbourhood contained in $U$, and $G \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is closed exactly when $\mathbb{R} \setminus G$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Define $U := \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : \omega_f(A \cap N_\rho(y)) < \varepsilon$ for some real $\rho > 0 \,\}$ and $G := \mathbb{R} \setminus U$. [construct]

2.1 $U$ is open. Let $y \in U$ with witness $\rho > 0$, and let $z \in N_{\rho/2}(y)$. Then $N_{\rho/2}(z) \subseteq N_\rho(y)$, hence $A \cap N_{\rho/2}(z) \subseteq A \cap N_\rho(y)$, hence $\omega_f(A \cap N_{\rho/2}(z)) \le \omega_f(A \cap N_\rho(y)) < \varepsilon$, so $z \in U$ with witness $\rho/2$. Thus $N_{\rho/2}(y) \subseteq U$. [step 1.1, L1, L3, L4]

2.2 Let $x \in A$ with $x \notin U$. Then $\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(x)) \ge \varepsilon$ for every real $\delta > 0$, so $\varepsilon$ is a lower bound of the set whose infimum is $\omega_f(x)$, and therefore $\omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon$, that is $x \in E_\varepsilon$. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.3 Let $x \in E_\varepsilon$, so $x \in A$ and $\omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon$. For every real $\delta > 0$ the value $\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(x))$ is at least the infimum $\omega_f(x)$, hence at least $\varepsilon$; so no $\rho$ witnesses membership of $x$ in $U$, that is $x \notin U$. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

3.1 $G$ is closed, being the complement of the open set $U$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L4]

4.1 Steps 2.2 and 2.3 together say that for $x \in A$ one has $x \in E_\varepsilon$ if and only if $x \in G$; hence $E_\varepsilon = A \cap G$ with $G$ closed. [step 3.1, step 2.2, step 2.3]

5.1 If $A = \mathbb{R}$ then $E_\varepsilon = \mathbb{R} \cap G = G$ is closed in $\mathbb{R}$. [step 4.1, L4] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the strict inequality is on the open side.** The set $U$ is defined by a
  strict inequality and an existential quantifier over $\rho$, which is what
  makes it open; its complement is then closed, and the superlevel set
  $\{\omega_f \ge \varepsilon\}$ is what remains of it inside $A$. Defining
  $E_\varepsilon$ with a strict inequality instead, as
  $\{\omega_f > \varepsilon\}$, would not give a closed set in general, and the
  exhaustion of [[thm-discontinuity-set-is-f-sigma]] is arranged so that only the
  non-strict form is ever needed.

- **The relative form is the honest one.** For general $A$ the set
  $E_\varepsilon$ is a subset of $A$ and there is no reason for it to be closed
  in $\mathbb{R}$: taking $A = (0,1)$ and $f$ the restriction of a function with
  oscillation $\ge \varepsilon$ everywhere gives $E_\varepsilon = (0,1)$, which
  is not closed. What is always true is the displayed identity
  $E_\varepsilon = A \cap G$, and that is what the theorems downstream use.

## Statement

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$ and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be of
Baire class one ([[def-baire-class-one]]). Write

$$D \;:=\; \{\, x \in [a,b] : f \text{ is discontinuous at } x \,\}, \qquad C := [a,b] \setminus D$$

([[def-continuity-real]]). Then:

1. for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the set
   $D_\varepsilon := \{\, x \in [a,b] : \omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon \,\}$
   ([[def-oscillation]]) is a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}$ containing **no**
   nondegenerate closed interval, hence nowhere dense
   ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]]);
2. $D$ is meager, being the union of the sequence
   $(D_{1/\iota(n+1)})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of nowhere dense sets;
3. $C$ is dense in $[a,b]$: for every $x \in [a,b]$ and every real $\rho > 0$
   the set $[a,b] \cap N_\rho(x)$ contains a point of $C$;
4. $C = [a,b] \cap V$ for a $G_\delta$ subset $V \subseteq \mathbb{R}$
   ([[def-f-sigma-g-delta]]).

**On the phrase "dense $G_\delta$".** Claims 3 and 4 together are what the
classical statement calls a *dense $G_\delta$ subset of $[a,b]$*: the continuity
set is dense in $[a,b]$ and it is the trace on $[a,b]$ of a $G_\delta$ subset of
$\mathbb{R}$. It is not claimed that $C$ is $G_\delta$ as a subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, nor that it is dense in $\mathbb{R}$; neither is true in general,
since $C \subseteq [a,b]$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, a function $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ of Baire class one, and a sequence $(f_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of continuous functions on $[a,b]$ converging pointwise to $f$.

[L1] $f$ of Baire class one on $[a,b]$ means: there are continuous $f_k : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ with $f_k(x) \to f(x)$ for every $x \in [a,b]$ ([[def-baire-class-one]], [[def-continuity-real]], [[def-real-limit]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L2] $\omega_f(S) = \sup\{|f(x)-f(y)| : x,y \in S\}$; $\omega_f(x) = \inf\{\omega_f([a,b] \cap N_\delta(x)) : \delta > 0\}$; $\omega_f$ is monotone under inclusion and $\omega_f(x) \ge 0$ ([[def-oscillation]]).

[L4] For every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a closed $G \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ with $\{x \in [a,b] : \omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon\} = [a,b] \cap G$ ([[lem-oscillation-superlevel-sets-are-closed]]).

[L5] If $a < b$, $(F_n)$ are closed and $[a,b] \subseteq \bigcup_n F_n$, then some $F_n \cap [a,b]$ contains a nondegenerate closed interval ([[lem-baire-category-in-a-closed-interval]]).

[L6] $[a,b]$ and every $[c,d]$ with $c \le d$ are closed; an intersection of a nonempty family of closed sets is closed; a set is closed exactly when its complement is open ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], claim 3, [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L7] For a continuous $h$ on $[a,b]$ and a closed $F \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, the preimage $\{x \in [a,b] : h(x) \in F\}$ is $G \cap [a,b]$ for some closed $G$ ([[thm-continuity-preimage-characterisation]]); differences and absolute values of continuous functions are continuous ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]]).

[L8] A closed set with empty interior is nowhere dense, and a union of a sequence of nowhere dense sets is meager ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]]).

[L9] The set of continuity points of $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is $A \cap V$ for a $G_\delta$ set $V \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, and the discontinuity set is $\{x \in A : \omega_f(x) > 0\} = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \{x \in A : \omega_f(x) \ge 1/\iota(n+1)\}$ ([[thm-discontinuity-set-is-f-sigma]], claims 1 and 2, [[def-f-sigma-g-delta]]).

[L10] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $m \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(m) < \eta$; $\iota$ is positive on the naturals $\ge 1$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L11] $|u - w| \le |u - v| + |v - w|$, $|u| \ge 0$, and a real that is $\le \eta$ for every real $\eta > 0$ and $\ge 0$ is $0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L12] $\max$ and $\min$ of two reals exist; $N_\rho(x) = (x-\rho, x+\rho)$; a point interior to a set has a neighbourhood inside it ([[def-max-min]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Refinement claim.** Let $[c,d] \subseteq [a,b]$ with $c < d$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real. For $N \in \mathbb{N}$ put $E_{N} := \{\, x \in [c,d] : |f_{n}(x) - f_{m}(x)| \le \varepsilon/4 \ \text{for all } n, m \ge N \,\}$. [L1, construct]

1.2 Claim 1. Fix a real $\varepsilon > 0$ and let $D_{\varepsilon} := \{x \in [a,b] : \omega_{f}(x) \ge \varepsilon\}$. It is closed in $\mathbb{R}$, being $[a,b] \cap G$ with $G$ closed and $[a,b]$ closed. [L4, L6]

1.3 Claim 4. The set of continuity points of $f$ on the domain $[a,b]$ is $[a,b] \cap V$ for a $G_\delta$ subset $V \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. [L9]

1.4 Claim 3. Let $x \in [a,b]$ and let $\rho > 0$ be real. The set $[a,b] \cap N_{\rho}(x)$ contains a nondegenerate closed interval $[c,d]$ with $c < d$, because $a < b$: taking $c := \max\{a,\ x - \rho/2\}$ and $d := \min\{b,\ x + \rho/2\}$ gives $[c,d] \subseteq [a,b] \cap N_{\rho}(x)$ and $c < d$: if $x = a$ then $c = a$ and $d = \min\{b, a + \rho/2\} > a$; if $x = b$ then $d = b$ and $c = \max\{a, b - \rho/2\} < b$; and if $a < x < b$ then $c < x < d$. [L12]

2.1 Each $E_{N}$ is closed: for fixed $n, m$ the set $\{x \in [c,d] : |f_{n}(x) - f_{m}(x)| \le \varepsilon/4\}$ is the preimage under the continuous function $|f_{n} - f_{m}|$ of the closed set $\{y : y \le \varepsilon/4\}$, hence of the form $G \cap [c,d]$ with $G$ closed, hence closed since $[c,d]$ is; and $E_{N}$ is the intersection of that nonempty family of closed sets over the pairs $n, m \ge N$. [step 1.1, L6, L7]

2.2 $[c,d] = \bigcup_{N \in \mathbb{N}} E_{N}$: for $x \in [c,d]$ the sequence $(f_{k}(x))$ converges to $f(x)$, so there is $N$ with $|f_{k}(x) - f(x)| < \varepsilon/8$ for all $k \ge N$, and then $|f_{n}(x) - f_{m}(x)| \le |f_{n}(x) - f(x)| + |f(x) - f_{m}(x)| < \varepsilon/4$ for all $n, m \ge N$. [step 1.1, L1, L11]

3.1 By the interval form of Baire category applied to $[c,d]$ and the sequence $(E_{N})$, there are $N \in \mathbb{N}$ and reals $u' < v'$ with $[u',v'] \subseteq E_{N} \cap [c,d] = E_{N}$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, L5]

4.1 For every $x \in [u',v']$ one has $|f_{N}(x) - f(x)| \le \varepsilon/4$. Indeed, let $\eta > 0$ be real; since $f_{m}(x) \to f(x)$ there is $m \ge N$ with $|f_{m}(x) - f(x)| < \eta$, and then $|f_{N}(x) - f(x)| \le |f_{N}(x) - f_{m}(x)| + |f_{m}(x) - f(x)| < \varepsilon/4 + \eta$; as $\eta > 0$ was arbitrary this gives $|f_{N}(x) - f(x)| \le \varepsilon/4$. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L1, L11]

4.2 Put $x_{0} := (u'+v')/2$, so $u' < x_{0} < v'$. Since $f_{N}$ is continuous at $x_{0}$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ with $|f_{N}(x) - f_{N}(x_{0})| < \varepsilon/4$ for every $x \in [a,b]$ with $|x - x_{0}| < \delta$. Put $u := \max\{u',\ x_{0} - \delta/2\}$ and $v := \min\{v',\ x_{0} + \delta/2\}$, so that $u < x_{0} < v$ and $[u,v] \subseteq [u',v']$ with $|x - x_{0}| < \delta$ for every $x \in [u,v]$. [step 3.1, L1, L12]

5.1 For $x, y \in [u,v]$: $|f(x) - f(y)| \le |f(x) - f_{N}(x)| + |f_{N}(x) - f_{N}(x_{0})| + |f_{N}(x_{0}) - f_{N}(y)| + |f_{N}(y) - f(y)| \le \varepsilon/4 + \varepsilon/4 + \varepsilon/4 + \varepsilon/4 = \varepsilon$. Hence $\omega_{f}([u,v]) \le \varepsilon$, $\varepsilon$ being an upper bound of the set whose supremum that is. [step 4.1, step 4.2, L2, L11]

6.1 **The refinement claim is proved:** for every $[c,d] \subseteq [a,b]$ with $c < d$ and every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there are $u < v$ with $[u,v] \subseteq [c,d]$ and $\omega_{f}([u,v]) \le \varepsilon$. Moreover every $x$ with $u < x < v$ satisfies $\omega_{f}(x) \le \varepsilon$, since $[a,b] \cap N_{\rho}(x) \subseteq [u,v]$ for $\rho := \min\{x-u,\ v-x\} > 0$ and $\omega_{f}$ is monotone under inclusion. [step 4.2, step 5.1, L2, L12]

7.1 $D_{\varepsilon}$ contains no nondegenerate closed interval. Were $[c,d] \subseteq D_{\varepsilon}$ with $c < d$, the refinement claim applied to $[c,d]$ and to the positive real $\varepsilon/2$ would give $u < v$ with $[u,v] \subseteq [c,d]$ and $\omega_{f}(x) \le \varepsilon/2 < \varepsilon$ for every $x$ with $u < x < v$; such an $x$ lies in $[c,d] \subseteq D_{\varepsilon}$ and so satisfies $\omega_{f}(x) \ge \varepsilon$, which is impossible. [step 6.1, step 1.2]

8.1 Hence $D_{\varepsilon}$ is nowhere dense: it is closed, so it equals its own closure, and its interior is empty, since an interior point would have a neighbourhood $N_{\rho}(x) \subseteq D_{\varepsilon}$ and then $[x - \rho/2,\ x + \rho/2]$ would be a nondegenerate closed interval inside $D_{\varepsilon}$. [step 1.2, step 7.1, L8, L12]

9.1 Claim 2. $D = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} D_{1/\iota(n+1)}$, and each $D_{1/\iota(n+1)}$ is nowhere dense by step 8.1, so $D$ is a union of a sequence of nowhere dense sets, that is, meager. [step 8.1, L8, L9, L10]

10.1 Suppose $[c,d] \subseteq D$ with $c < d$ as in step 1.4. Then $[c,d]$ is covered by the sequence $(D_{1/\iota(n+1)})$ of closed sets, so by the interval form of Baire category some $D_{1/\iota(n+1)} \cap [c,d]$ contains a nondegenerate closed interval, contradicting step 7.1. So $[c,d] \not\subseteq D$, and any point of $[c,d] \setminus D$ is a point of $C$ inside $[a,b] \cap N_{\rho}(x)$. [step 7.1, step 9.1, step 1.4, L5, L6]

11.1 Claims 1, 2, 3 and 4 are therefore proved: claim 1 by steps 1.2, 7.1 and 8.1, claim 2 by step 9.1, claim 3 by steps 1.4 and 10.1, and claim 4 by step 1.3. [step 8.1, step 9.1, step 1.3, step 10.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the hypothesis of Baire class one is used.** The hypothesis enters through the approximating sequence fixed in step 1.1. Pointwise convergence is used in steps 2.2 and 4.1, and continuity of the approximants is used in steps 2.1 and 4.2. These facts establish the refinement claim in step 6.1. From step 7.1 onward the proof uses only that claim, oscillation, and category.

- **The conclusion is sharp in the sense that "meager" cannot be improved to "at most countable".** The theorem constrains the discontinuity set by category, not by cardinality. Nothing above bounds the size of $D$; a meager set can be uncountable, the Cantor set being one ([[thm-cantor-set-properties]]), so the theorem leaves open how large a discontinuity set a Baire class one function may have. What it does exclude outright is a Baire class one function on $[0,1]$ that is nowhere continuous, and the companion page spends exactly that on the Dirichlet function.

- **The dense set is not claimed to be uncountable, and no measure statement is made.** Meagerness is a statement about category alone ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]]); nothing above bears on the measure of $D$, and the two notions of smallness are independent, as [[cor-q-is-meager-and-not-g-delta]] and the fat Cantor set already record.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Then

$$f \text{ is continuous at } c \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \omega_f(c) = 0$$

([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-oscillation]]).

Since $\omega_f(c) \ge 0$ always ([[def-oscillation]]), the equivalent form of
the right-hand side is: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ with $\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c)) < \varepsilon$.

**This is the tool that converts a pointwise condition into a set condition.**
Continuity at $c$ is a statement about $f$ near $c$ with a quantifier over
$\varepsilon$; $\omega_f(c) = 0$ is the vanishing of a single extended real
attached to the point. The change of form is what makes the discontinuity set
accessible: the sets $\{\,x : \omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon\,\}$ are closed
([[lem-oscillation-superlevel-sets-are-closed]]) and their union over
$\varepsilon = 1, 1/2, 1/3, \dots$ is the discontinuity set
([[thm-discontinuity-set-is-f-sigma]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$, and a point $c \in A$.

[L1] $f$ is continuous at $c$ exactly when for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ with $|f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ for every $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$; equivalently for every $x \in A \cap N_\delta(c)$ ([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L2] $\omega_f(S) = \sup\{|f(x) - f(y)| : x, y \in S\}$ and $\omega_f(c) = \inf\{\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c)) : \delta > 0\}$, both in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$; $0 \le \omega_f(c) \le \omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c))$ for every real $\delta > 0$, and $c \in A \cap N_\delta(c)$ ([[def-oscillation]], [[def-extended-reals]]).

[L3] In $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ every subset has a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound; a supremum is at most an extended real $u$ exactly when $u$ bounds every member of the set, and an infimum is at least an extended real $\ell$ exactly when $\ell$ bounds every member from below ([[lem-extended-reals-complete]]).

[L4] $|u - w| \le |u - v| + |v - w|$ and $|u| \ge 0$ for reals $u, v, w$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Suppose $f$ is continuous at $c$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real. Take $\delta > 0$ with $|f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon/2$ for every $x \in A \cap N_\delta(c)$. [L1]

1.2 Conversely, suppose $\omega_f(c) = 0$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real. Not every member of $\{\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c)) : \delta > 0\}$ can be $\ge \varepsilon$, for then $\varepsilon$ would be a lower bound of that set and the infimum $\omega_f(c) = 0$ would satisfy $0 \ge \varepsilon$. So there is a real $\delta > 0$ with $\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c)) < \varepsilon$. [L2, L3]

2.1 For $x, y \in A \cap N_\delta(c)$ with $\delta$ as in step 1.1, $|f(x) - f(y)| \le |f(x) - f(c)| + |f(c) - f(y)| < \varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$; so $\varepsilon$ is an upper bound of the set whose supremum is $\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c))$, and therefore $\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c)) \le \varepsilon$. [step 1.1, L2, L3, L4]

2.2 With $\delta$ as in step 1.2 and any $x \in A \cap N_\delta(c)$: both $x$ and $c$ lie in $A \cap N_\delta(c)$, so $|f(x) - f(c)|$ is one of the values whose supremum is $\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c))$ and therefore $|f(x) - f(c)| \le \omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c)) < \varepsilon$. [step 1.2, L2, L3]

3.1 Hence $0 \le \omega_f(c) \le \varepsilon$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$. If $\omega_f(c)$ were not $0$ it would satisfy $0 < \omega_f(c) \le 1$, hence be a positive real, and taking $\varepsilon := \omega_f(c)/2$ would give $\omega_f(c) \le \omega_f(c)/2$, which is false for a positive real. So $\omega_f(c) = 0$. [step 2.1, L2, L3]

4.1 Since $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary in step 1.2, the continuity condition holds at $c$, and $f$ is continuous at $c$. Together with step 3.1 this proves the equivalence. [step 3.1, step 2.2, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the extended reals are used, and where they are not.** The definition
  of $\omega_f$ needs them, because $f$ may be unbounded near $c$ and the
  supremum may then be $+\infty$; the proof needs only the order relations, and
  the two directions never compare an infinite value with a real except through
  the inequality $0 \le \omega_f(c) \le \varepsilon$, which already forces
  $\omega_f(c)$ to be real.

- **The oscillation measures how badly continuity fails, not merely whether it
  does.** The theorem uses only whether $\omega_f(c)$ vanishes, but the number
  itself carries more: the oscillation of Thomae's function at a point $c$ is
  proved below to be exactly $t(c)$
  ([[thm-dirichlet-and-thomae-continuity-sets]]), so it is $1/q$ at a rational
  with least denominator $q$ and $0$ at every irrational.

## Statement

Let $G \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be a $G_\delta$ set ([[def-f-sigma-g-delta]]). Then
there is a function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ whose set of continuity
points ([[def-continuity-real]]) is exactly $G$.

Together with [[thm-discontinuity-set-is-f-sigma]], which says that the
continuity set of every $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a $G_\delta$ set, this
identifies the two classes:

$$\{\, \text{continuity sets of functions } \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \,\} \;=\; \{\, G_\delta \text{ subsets of } \mathbb{R} \,\} .$$

**The construction.** Write $G = \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} V_n$ with each $V_n$
open and put $W_n := V_0 \cap \dots \cap V_n$, so that the $W_n$ are open and
decreasing with $\bigcap_n W_n = G$. For $x \notin G$ let $n(x)$ be the least $n$
with $x \notin W_n$, and set

$$f(x) := 0 \ \text{ for } x \in G, \qquad f(x) := \frac{1}{\iota(n(x)+1)} \ \text{ for } x \notin G,\ x \in \mathbb{Q}, \qquad f(x) := -\frac{1}{\iota(n(x)+1)} \ \text{ for } x \notin G,\ x \notin \mathbb{Q}.$$

The sign carries the whole of the discontinuity: near a point outside $G$ there
are points of the opposite rationality, where $f$ has the opposite sign or is
$0$, and the values cannot come close.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A $G_\delta$ set $G = \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} V_n \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ with each $V_n$ open.

[L1] A finite intersection of open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ is open ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], claim 2); a set $U$ is open exactly when every point of it has a neighbourhood $N_\rho(x) \subseteq U$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L2] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L3] Both $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$ are dense in $\mathbb{R}$, so every neighbourhood of every real contains a rational and an irrational ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L4] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $m \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(m) < \eta$, and $\iota$ is positive and strictly increasing on the naturals $\ge 1$, so $j < k$ gives $1/\iota(k+1) < 1/\iota(j+1)$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L5] The continuity set of any $h : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a $G_\delta$ subset of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-discontinuity-set-is-f-sigma]], case $A = \mathbb{R}$, [[def-f-sigma-g-delta]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 Put $W_n := \bigcap_{j \le n} V_j$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Each $W_n$ is open, being a finite intersection of open sets; $W_{n+1} \subseteq W_n$; and $\bigcap_{n} W_n = \bigcap_{n} V_n = G$, since a point lies in every $W_n$ exactly when it lies in every $V_j$. [L1, construct]

2.1 For $x \notin G$ the set $\{\, n \in \mathbb{N} : x \notin W_n \,\}$ is nonempty, so $n(x) := \min\{\, n : x \notin W_n \,\}$ is defined; and $x \in W_j$ for every $j < n(x)$, by minimality. [step 1.1, L2, construct]

2.2 $f$ is continuous at every $x \in G$. Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real and take a natural $m \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(m) < \varepsilon$. Since $x \in G \subseteq W_{m}$ and $W_{m}$ is open, there is a real $\rho > 0$ with $N_\rho(x) \subseteq W_{m}$. [step 1.1, L1, L4]

3.1 Define $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ by $f(x) := 0$ for $x \in G$, $f(x) := 1/\iota(n(x)+1)$ for $x \notin G$ with $x$ rational, and $f(x) := -1/\iota(n(x)+1)$ for $x \notin G$ with $x$ irrational. Then $f(x) = 0$ exactly for $x \in G$, since $1/\iota(n+1) > 0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$; moreover $f(x) > 0$ at a rational outside $G$ and $f(x) < 0$ at an irrational outside $G$. [step 2.1, L4, construct]

4.1 With $m$ and $\rho$ as in step 2.2, let $y \in N_\rho(x)$. If $y \in G$ then $f(y) = 0$. If $y \notin G$ then $y \in W_{m}$, so $n(y) \ne m$ and indeed $n(y) > m$, because $y \in W_{m}$ forces $y \in W_j$ for every $j \le m$; hence $|f(y)| = 1/\iota(n(y)+1) < 1/\iota(m) < \varepsilon$, using $n(y) + 1 > m$. In both cases $|f(y) - f(x)| = |f(y)| < \varepsilon$, since $f(x) = 0$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 3.1, step 2.2, L4]

4.2 $f$ is discontinuous at every $x \notin G$. Put $\varepsilon := 1/\iota(n(x)+1) > 0$, so that $|f(x)| = \varepsilon$, and let $\delta > 0$ be real. If $x$ is rational then $f(x) = \varepsilon > 0$; the neighbourhood $N_\delta(x)$ contains an irrational $y$, and $f(y) \le 0$, whether $y \in G$ or not. If $x$ is irrational then $f(x) = -\varepsilon < 0$; the neighbourhood $N_\delta(x)$ contains a rational $y$, and $f(y) \ge 0$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L3]

5.1 In either case of step 4.2 the point $y$ satisfies $|f(y) - f(x)| \ge \varepsilon$, since $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ have opposite weak signs and $|f(x)| = \varepsilon$. So no $\delta$ witnesses the continuity condition at $x$ for this $\varepsilon$, and $f$ is discontinuous at $x$. [step 4.2]

6.1 By steps 4.1 and 5.1 the set of continuity points of the function $f$ constructed in step 3.1 is exactly $G$, which proves the theorem. Combined with the fact that every continuity set is $G_\delta$, the two classes coincide. [step 3.1, step 4.1, step 5.1, L5, discharge-construct] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the $V_n$ are replaced by the decreasing $W_n$.** The index $n(x)$ is useful only because $y \in W_m$ implies $y \in W_j$ for all $j \le m$, which is what makes $n(y) > m$ in step 4.1. For an arbitrary sequence $(V_n)$ that implication fails, and $n(x)$ would carry no information about how deep $x$ sits in the intersection. Passing to the finite intersections costs nothing, since they are still open and still intersect to $G$.

- **Two extreme cases.** For $G = \mathbb{R}$ the construction gives $f = 0$, continuous everywhere. For $G = \varnothing$, obtained as the intersection of the sequence constantly $\varnothing$, every $x$ lies outside $W_0 = \varnothing$, so $n(x) = 0$ and $f$ takes the value $1$ at every rational and $-1$ at every irrational; it is nowhere continuous, as the Dirichlet function is ([[thm-dirichlet-and-thomae-continuity-sets]]).

- **The construction does not guarantee monotonicity, and the theorem does not claim it.** The function built above always takes values in $[-1,1]$, so it is bounded; no further behaviour beyond its continuity set is asserted.
