You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as
an independent adversarial proof-refuter. Return evidence only; Audit-Alpha
alone adjudicates and edits.

## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the target's title, complete public statement, Facts & Assumptions, every
numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks. Try to falsify every
load-bearing inference. Before alleging that a cited dependency is too weak,
compare the exact current supplied dependency: domain, hypotheses, quantifiers,
direction, conclusion, boundary cases, and conventions. Check biconditionals,
existence/uniqueness, recursion/induction, limits, index shifts, empty/zero/one/
endpoint/degenerate cases, hidden division, hidden choice, and false Remarks.
For an `ai-generated` proof, actively search for a counterexample. A false
public claim, invalid proof, missing necessary hypothesis, circularity, or
materially inaccurate load-bearing citation is fatal; a quickly closable gap is
nonfatal.

Return no more than 450 words, exactly in this shape:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

For each defect:

```text
FINDING 1
  location: [exact section/fact/step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [exact assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]
```

Always end with:

```text
BOUNDARY: [specific boundary/counterexample checks and disposition]
SOURCES:  [confirm every supplied cited item used by the target was inspected]
CHECKED:  [confirm title, public claim, every numbered step, and Remarks]
```

## Statement

Let $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be additive ([[def-additive-function]]), and
identify $\mathbb{N} \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Q} \subseteq
\mathbb{R}$ along the canonical embeddings ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]],
[[lem-int-embeds-rat]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), writing $\iota(n)$ for the
canonical natural of $n$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-canonical-natural]]). Then, for
every real $x$:

1. $f(0) = 0$;
2. $f(-x) = -f(x)$;
3. $f(\iota(n)\,x) = \iota(n)\,f(x)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$;
4. $f(m x) = m\,f(x)$ for every integer $m$;
5. $f(q x) = q\,f(x)$ for every rational $q$.

In particular, taking $x = 1$ in claim 5, $f(q) = q\,f(1)$ at every rational $q$:
**an additive function is determined on $\mathbb{Q}$ by its value at $1$.**

**What this does not say.** Claim 5 is $\mathbb{Q}$-homogeneity, not
$\mathbb{R}$-homogeneity: nothing here gives $f(\lambda x) = \lambda f(x)$ for
irrational $\lambda$, and that is exactly the gap that
[[fs-additive-implies-linear]] shows cannot be closed without a regularity
hypothesis.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An additive $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, so $f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)$ for all reals $x, y$.

[A1] $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)$ for all reals $x, y$ ([[def-additive-function]]).

[L1] Induction on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L2] The canonical natural satisfies $\iota(0) = 0$ and $\iota(n+1) = \iota(n) + 1$, and it agrees with the additive multiple $n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-integer-multiples-agree-with-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L3] Every integer is $\iota(n)$ or $-\iota(n)$ for a natural $n$, and every rational is $m/\iota(n)$ with $m$ an integer and $n$ a natural $\ge 1$; the embeddings preserve sums and products, and $\iota(n) \ne 0$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]], [[lem-int-embeds-rat]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]], [[def-integers]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L4] $\mathbb{R}$ is a field, so cancellation, distributivity and inverses of nonzero elements are available ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Claim 1: taking $x = y = 0$ in the functional equation gives $f(0) = f(0) + f(0)$, and adding $-f(0)$ to both sides gives $f(0) = 0$. [A1, L4]

1.2 Claim 3, inductive hypothesis: suppose $f(\iota(n)x) = \iota(n)f(x)$ for a given $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and every real $x$. [ih]

2.1 Claim 2: taking $y = -x$ gives $0 = f(0) = f(x) + f(-x)$, so $f(-x) = -f(x)$. [step 1.1, A1, L4]

2.2 Claim 3, base case $n = 0$: $\iota(0) = 0$, so $f(\iota(0)x) = f(0) = 0 = \iota(0)f(x)$. [step 1.1, L2, base]

2.3 Claim 3, inductive step: $\iota(n+1)x = \iota(n)x + x$, so $f(\iota(n+1)x) = f(\iota(n)x) + f(x) = \iota(n)f(x) + f(x) = (\iota(n)+1)f(x) = \iota(n+1)f(x)$. [step 1.2, A1, L2, L4]

3.1 Claim 3 holds for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and every real $x$, by induction on $n$ from steps 2.2 and 2.3. [step 2.2, step 2.3, L1]

4.1 Claim 4: an integer $m$ is $\iota(n)$ or $-\iota(n)$ for some natural $n$. In the first case claim 3 applies directly. In the second, $f(mx) = f(-(\iota(n)x)) = -f(\iota(n)x) = -\iota(n)f(x) = m f(x)$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L3]

5.1 Claim 5: let $q$ be rational and write $q = m/\iota(n)$ with $m$ an integer and $n$ a natural $\ge 1$, so $\iota(n) \ne 0$. Applying claim 4 with the integer $\iota(n)$ to the real $qx$ gives $\iota(n) f(qx) = f(\iota(n) q x) = f(mx) = m f(x)$, and dividing by $\iota(n)$ gives $f(qx) = (m/\iota(n)) f(x) = q f(x)$. [step 4.1, L3, L4]

6.1 Taking $x = 1$ in claim 5 gives $f(q) = q f(1)$ for every rational $q$, and all five claims are proved. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 3.1, step 4.1, step 5.1, discharge-induction] ∎

## Remarks

- **The induction is on $\mathbb{N}$ and everything else is algebra.** Only
  claim 3 needs induction; claims 4 and 5 are obtained from it by the two field
  operations, and claims 1 and 2 are two substitutions into the equation. The
  base case is $n = 0$, where $\iota(0) = 0$ and the identity reads $f(0) = 0$;
  it is a genuine case and not a convention, since $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$.

- **This is the whole of the algebraic theory.** Every regularity theorem about
  Cauchy's equation ([[thm-cauchy-functional-equation-regularity]]) works by
  combining claim 5 with density of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$: the value of
  $f$ is pinned on a dense set, and a regularity hypothesis is what forbids the
  values off that set from being arbitrary.

## Definition

Let $\mathbb{R}$ be the complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]],
[[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]). A function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$
is **additive** when it satisfies **Cauchy's functional equation**

$$f(x + y) \;=\; f(x) + f(y) \qquad \text{for all } x, y \in \mathbb{R}.$$

Equivalently, $f$ is a homomorphism of the additive group of $\mathbb{R}$ into
itself.

**The linear maps are additive.** For a fixed real $c$ the function
$x \mapsto cx$ satisfies $c(x+y) = cx + cy$ by distributivity, so it is
additive. Cauchy's question is whether these are the only additive functions,
and the answer is a genuine dichotomy: with any one of a short list of
regularity conditions the answer is yes
([[thm-cauchy-functional-equation-regularity]]), and without any of them it is
no ([[fs-additive-implies-linear]]).

**No continuity, no monotonicity and no measurability is part of the
definition.** The equation is purely algebraic, and every regularity hypothesis
below is stated explicitly where it is used.

**A first consequence, recorded here because it is used immediately.** An
additive $f$ satisfies $f(0) = 0$: putting $x = y = 0$ gives
$f(0) = f(0) + f(0)$, and subtracting $f(0)$ gives $f(0) = 0$. The remaining
elementary consequences, including $f(-x) = -f(x)$ and $\mathbb{Q}$-homogeneity,
are collected in [[lem-additive-is-q-linear]].

## Definition

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]) with additive identity $0_F$ and
multiplicative identity $1_F$. Define
$\iota : \mathbb{N} \to F$ by recursion on $\mathbb{N}$
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[thm-recursion]]):

$$\iota(0) \;:=\; 0_F, \qquad \iota(n+1) \;:=\; \iota(n) + 1_F .$$

$\iota(n)$ is the **canonical natural** of $n$ in $F$. It is also written
$n \cdot 1_F$, and for $n \ge 1$ it is $1_F$ added to itself $n$ times.

**Why the notation is needed at all.** A natural number in this library is a von
Neumann natural, that is a set ([[def-natural-numbers]]), and a set is not an
element of $F$. So $1/n$, $n^{\alpha}$ and $x/n$ are not expressions of $F$ when
$n$ is a natural: what they mean is $1/\iota(n)$, $\iota(n)^{\alpha}$ and
$x/\iota(n)$. The map $\iota$ is what carries a counting number into the field,
and writing it is the whole reason a reader meets $1/\iota(k+1)$ where an
informal text would write $1/(k+1)$.

## Remarks

- **Where the index shift comes from.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
  ([[def-natural-numbers]]) and $\iota(0) = 0_F$, so $1/\iota(k)$ is undefined at
  $k = 0$. A family of reciprocals indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ is therefore written
  over $\iota(k+1)$, which is why the harmonic and telescoping families of this
  library run over $k+1$ rather than over $k$. This is bookkeeping, not a
  restriction: the values are the usual ones.

- **This definition records notation; the arithmetic is proved elsewhere.** That
  $\iota$ is strictly increasing and positive on $n \ge 1$, and that it carries
  sums to sums and products to products, is [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], stated
  for an ordered field. That lemma introduces the same element by the equivalent
  recursion $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, which
  agrees with the definition above because $\iota(1) = \iota(0) + 1_F = 1_F$.
  Nothing here is new mathematics; the definition exists so that the notation has
  a home a reader can look up.

- **The symbol $\iota$ is used in this library for other canonical maps, and this
  definition does not govern them.** It also denotes the canonical field
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to F$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), the isometric
  embedding of a metric space into a completion ([[def-metric-completion]]), and
  an inclusion map $\iota : S \to X$ of a subspace. Each of those is introduced
  where it is used and means something different from the map defined here. What
  the four share is only that each is the canonical map of its situation.

- **Fields, not just ordered fields.** The recursion needs no order, so the
  definition is stated for a field; every use in this library is in an ordered
  field, and the order is what makes $\iota$ injective
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). In a field of positive characteristic $\iota$
  is not injective, which is one reason the injectivity is a lemma rather than
  part of the definition.

## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq F$.

- $u \in F$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$; $S$ is
  **bounded above** if it has an upper bound.
- $u \in F$ is a **least upper bound** (or **supremum**, $\sup S$) of $S$ if $u$
  is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le u'$ for every upper bound $u'$ of $S$.

$F$ is a **complete ordered field** (equivalently, $F$ has the
**least-upper-bound property**, or is **Dedekind complete**) if every nonempty
$S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$.

## Remarks

- A least upper bound, if it exists, is unique (two least upper bounds are each
  $\le$ the other, so equal by antisymmetry of the order).
- Applying the property to $\{-s : s \in S\}$ yields the dual **greatest lower
  bound** (infimum) property, so the two are equivalent.
- The Dedekind-cut reals have this property by construction
  ([[thm-dedekind-complete]]); the Cauchy-sequence reals acquire it via
  [[cor-cauchy-reals-lub-complete]]. This definition is the target for the
  uniqueness theorem [[thm-uniqueness-complete-ordered-field]].

## Definition

On the set $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ of pairs of natural numbers, define

$$(a,b) \sim (c,d) \iff a + d = b + c.$$

This is an equivalence relation ([[lem-int-equivalence]]). The **integers** are
the quotient

$$\mathbb{Z} := (\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}) / \sim,$$

and we write $[(a,b)]$ for the equivalence class of $(a,b)$.

## Remarks

- The pair $(a,b)$ encodes the formal difference $a - b$; the defining relation
  $a + d = b + c$ is the equation "$a - b = c - d$" restated using only
  addition, which is all $\mathbb{N}$ has.
- $\mathbb{N}$ and its arithmetic (commutativity, associativity,
  distributivity, cancellation of addition, the order) are taken as given
  background throughout this construction.

## Statement

**FALSE.** Every additive $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$
([[def-additive-function]]) is of the form $x \mapsto c\,x$ for a single real
$c$.

What is true is the $\mathbb{Q}$-linear part of it, $f(qx) = q f(x)$ for rational
$q$ ([[lem-additive-is-q-linear]]), and the conditional statements of
[[thm-cauchy-functional-equation-regularity]], each of which adds a regularity
hypothesis. The claim above asserts the conclusion with no hypothesis at all,
and it is false.

**The refutation assumes the Axiom of Choice** ([[def-axiom-of-choice]]), which
it uses through [[lem-hamel-basis-exists]] and hence through [[thm-zorn]]. The
hypothesis is carried explicitly in the Facts below and in every step that needs
it. It is an axiom already adopted in this library, so the refutation is a
refutation and not a conditional one; what it does not settle is whether a
counterexample exists without choice, and nothing here bears on that question.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The Axiom of Choice, and $\mathbb{Q}$ denoting the canonical copy of the rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[A1] The Axiom of Choice ([[def-axiom-of-choice]], [[thm-zorn]]).

[L1] **Assume the Axiom of Choice.** Then there is $B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a basis of $\mathbb{R}$ as a vector space over $\mathbb{Q}$ by restriction of scalars, and for each $b_{\star} \in B$ a map $\Lambda_{b_{\star}} : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{Q}$ with $\Lambda_{b_{\star}}(x+y) = \Lambda_{b_{\star}}(x) + \Lambda_{b_{\star}}(y)$ for all reals $x, y$, with $\Lambda_{b_{\star}}(b_{\star}) = 1$, and with range the whole of $\mathbb{Q}$ ([[lem-hamel-basis-exists]], claims 1 and 4, [[lem-restriction-of-scalars]], [[def-vector-space]], [[def-linear-combination-and-span]]).

[L2] A function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is additive when $f(x+y) = f(x)+f(y)$ for all reals $x, y$ ([[def-additive-function]]).

[L3] There exists an irrational real, that is a real not lying in $\mathbb{Q}$: the irrationals are dense in $\mathbb{R}$ and in particular nonempty ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]).

[L4] $\mathbb{R}$ is a field, so a nonzero real is invertible ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume the Axiom of Choice and fix a Hamel basis $B$ of $\mathbb{R}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ together with an element $b_{\star} \in B$; such an element exists because $B$ spans $\mathbb{R}$, which is not $\{0\}$, so $B$ is nonempty. Put $f := \Lambda_{b_{\star}}$, regarded as a function $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$. [A1, L1, construct]

2.1 $f$ is additive: $\Lambda_{b_{\star}}(x+y) = \Lambda_{b_{\star}}(x) + \Lambda_{b_{\star}}(y)$ for all reals $x, y$ is one of the properties of the coefficient map. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.2 Every value of $f$ is rational, and $f(b_{\star}) = 1$. [step 1.1, L1]

3.1 Suppose there were a real $c$ with $f(x) = c\,x$ for every real $x$. Then $c\,b_{\star} = f(b_{\star}) = 1$, so $c \ne 0$ and $c$ is invertible. [step 1.1, step 2.2, L4]

4.1 Take an irrational real $\theta$ and put $x_{0} := c^{-1}\theta$. Then $f(x_{0}) = c\,x_{0} = \theta$, which is irrational; but every value of $f$ is rational by step 2.2. This is impossible, so no such $c$ exists. [step 2.2, step 3.1, L3, L4]

5.1 So $f$ is an additive function $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ that is not of the form $x \mapsto c\,x$ for any real $c$, and the claim in the Statement is false. [step 2.1, step 4.1, discharge-construct] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the witness looks like, by the regularity theorem.** Since $f$ is additive and not of the form $x \mapsto cx$, the contrapositive of each clause of [[thm-cauchy-functional-equation-regularity]] applies: $f$ is continuous at no point of $\mathbb{R}$, is bounded neither above nor below on any nondegenerate interval, is monotone on no nondegenerate interval, is of constant sign on none, and its graph is dense in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. The companion page states and uses exactly this in full.

- **The cost is the Axiom of Choice, and only that.** The construction uses no other principle, and AC is an axiom this library has adopted, so nothing here is conditional in the sense of resting on unproved material. It is worth being precise about what is *not* claimed: it is not claimed that no explicit non-linear additive function can be written down, only that this one is produced by a proof that exhibits nothing.

- **Every hypothesis that would rescue the claim is already recorded.** Adding any single one of the six conditions of [[thm-cauchy-functional-equation-regularity]] turns the false statement into a theorem. That is the reason the false statement is worth stating: the failure is not marginal, and yet it is repaired by an extremely weak hypothesis, as little as continuity at one single point.

## Statement

The map $j(k) = [(k,1)]$ is injective and preserves addition, multiplication,
and order. Composing with [[lem-nat-embeds-int]] embeds $\mathbb{N}$ in
$\mathbb{Q}$; we write $k$ for $j(k)$ throughout.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The map $j : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Q}$, $j(k) = [(k,1)]$.

[L1] Ring arithmetic in $\mathbb{Z}$ ([[thm-int-comm-ring]]).

[L2] The order on $\mathbb{Q}$ ([[def-rat-order]]), whose defining inequality is read in the order on $\mathbb{Z}$ ([[def-int-order]]).

[L3] Equality in $\mathbb{Q}$: $[(a,b)] = [(c,d)]$ iff $ad = cb$ ([[def-rationals]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Injectivity: $(k,1) \sim (m,1)$ means $k \cdot 1 = m \cdot 1$, i.e. $k = m$. [L3, L1]

1.2 Addition: $j(k) + j(m) = [(k \cdot 1 + m \cdot 1,\; 1)] = j(k+m)$. [L1]

1.3 Multiplication: $j(k)\,j(m) = [(km,\, 1)] = j(km)$. [L1]

1.4 Order: denominators are $1 > 0$, so $j(k) \le j(m)$ reads $k \cdot 1 \le m \cdot 1$, i.e. $k \le m$. [L1, L2]

2.1 $j$ embeds $\mathbb{Z}$ into $\mathbb{Q}$, preserving arithmetic and order. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, step 1.4] ∎

[[lem-field-is-a-commutative-ring]]. Two functions $\mathbb{N} \to F$ are in
play:

- $\iota$, the **canonical natural** of [[def-canonical-natural]], defined by
  $\iota(0) = 0_F$ and $\iota(n+1) = \iota(n) + 1_F$;
- $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$, the **additive natural power** of the element $1_F$ in
  the abelian group $(F,+,0_F)$, defined by [[def-group-power]] read additively:
  $0 \cdot 1_F = 0_F$ and $\sigma(n)\cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$.

These are the same function: $\iota(n) = n \cdot 1_F$ for every
$n \in \mathbb{N}$. In particular the notation $n \cdot 1_F$ used by
[[def-canonical-natural]] and the notation $n \cdot 1_F$ used by
[[def-group-power]] denote the same element of $F$, and no second notion is in
play.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A field $F$ with $0_F$ and $1_F$, the map $\iota : \mathbb{N} \to F$ of [[def-canonical-natural]], and the additive natural powers of [[def-group-power]] in the group $(F,+,0_F)$.

[L1] $F$ is a ring, so $(F,+,0_F)$ is an abelian group ([[lem-field-is-a-commutative-ring]], [[def-ring]], [[def-group]]).

[L2] $\iota(0) = 0_F$ and $\iota(n+1) = \iota(n) + 1_F$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-canonical-natural]]).

[L3] The additive natural powers satisfy $0 \cdot a = 0_F$ and $\sigma(n) \cdot a = n \cdot a + a$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and every $a \in F$ ([[def-group-power]]).

[L4] On $\mathbb{N}$: $m + 0 = m$ and $m + \sigma(n) = \sigma(m+n)$, so $n + 1 = \sigma(n)$ ([[def-nat-addition]], [[def-natural-numbers]]).

[L5] The recursion theorem: for a set $A$, an element $a \in A$ and a function $u : A \to A$ there is exactly one $g : \mathbb{N} \to A$ with $g(0) = a$ and $g(\sigma(n)) = u(g(n))$ ([[thm-recursion]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $u : F \to F$ be the function $u(t) = t + 1_F$, which is a function from $F$ to $F$ because addition is a binary operation on $F$. By [L5] applied with $A = F$, $a = 0_F$ and this $u$, there is exactly one function $g : \mathbb{N} \to F$ satisfying $g(0) = 0_F$ and $g(\sigma(n)) = g(n) + 1_F$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. [L1, L5]

1.2 The map $\iota$ satisfies those two equations: $\iota(0) = 0_F$ by [L2], and $\iota(\sigma(n)) = \iota(n+1) = \iota(n) + 1_F$ by [L2] together with $n + 1 = \sigma(n)$. [L2, L4]

1.3 The map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ satisfies them too: $0 \cdot 1_F = 0_F$ and $\sigma(n)\cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, both by [L3] with $a = 1_F$. [L3]

2.1 By the uniqueness clause of step 1.1, the two functions of steps 1.2 and 1.3 are equal, so $\iota(n) = n \cdot 1_F$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, L5] ∎

## Remarks

- **This is the item the characteristic rests on.** [[def-ring-characteristic]]
  is stated for an arbitrary ring using the additive powers of
  [[def-group-power]]; for a field a reader may already know
  [[def-canonical-natural]], and without the present lemma the page would carry
  two notations for one element and invite the reader to assume they agree. That
  assumption is exactly the defect this item removes, and it is removed by a
  proof rather than by a remark.

- **Uniqueness, not a computation, is what does the work.** Both functions are
  characterised by the same recursion, and [[thm-recursion]] says a recursion of
  that shape has exactly one solution. An induction on $\mathbb{N}$ would prove
  the same thing directly; nothing is gained by writing it out, since the
  uniqueness clause of [[thm-recursion]] is that induction.

- **$\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$, and $\iota(0) = 0_F$**, not $1_F$. So $\iota$ is
  not the map $n \mapsto$ "$1_F$ added to itself $n$ times" for $n \ge 1$ only:
  the value at $0$ is a genuine value of the recursion.
  [[def-canonical-natural]] records the same point, and the published
  [[lem-of-naturals-positive]] states its own recursion from $n = 1$, which
  agrees because $\iota(1) = \iota(0) + 1_F = 1_F$.

## Statement

The map $\iota(n) = [(n,0)]$ is injective and preserves addition,
multiplication, and order. Its image is exactly the set of nonnegative
integers, so every $x \ge 0$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ is $\iota(k)$ for a unique
natural $k$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The map $\iota : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$, $\iota(n) = [(n,0)]$.

[A1] Arithmetic identities in $\mathbb{N}$: $x + 0 = x$, $0 + x = x$, $x \cdot 0 = 0$, $0 \cdot x = 0$, $x \cdot 1 = x$.

[A2] The order on $\mathbb{N}$, and: $x \le y$ iff $y = x + k$ for some $k$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Injectivity: $[(m,0)] = [(n,0)]$ means $m + 0 = 0 + n$, i.e. $m = n$. [A1]

1.2 Addition: $\iota(m) + \iota(n) = [(m+n,\, 0+0)] = \iota(m+n)$. [A1]

1.3 Multiplication: $\iota(m)\,\iota(n) = [(mn + 0 \cdot 0,\; m \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot n)] = \iota(mn)$. [A1]

1.4 Order: $\iota(m) \le \iota(n)$ reads $m + 0 \le 0 + n$, i.e. $m \le n$. [A1, A2]

1.5 Image: if $0 \le [(a,b)]$ then $b \le a$, so $a = b + k$ and $(a,b) \sim (k,0)$, giving $[(a,b)] = \iota(k)$; conversely $0 \le \iota(k)$ for every $k$. [A2, algebra]

2.1 $\iota$ embeds $\mathbb{N}$ into $\mathbb{Z}$, preserving arithmetic and order, with image the nonnegative integers. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, step 1.4, step 1.5] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field, with field structure as in [[def-field]], and for
$n \ge 1$ let $n \cdot 1_F$ denote the canonical natural number
$\underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$, defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$
and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$. Then for every $n \ge 1$:

- $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$;
- the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$;
- $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ and $(mn) \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F)$ for all $m, n \ge 1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ whose canonical naturals are defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, with $0 \cdot 1_F = 0$.

[L1] $0 < 1_F$ in every ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] The order is compatible with addition and positives are closed under addition: $a < b$ implies $a + c < b + c$, and $a > 0$, $b > 0$ imply $a + b > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 1$: by definition $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, and $1_F > 0$. [L1, base]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: assume $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for some fixed $n \ge 1$. [ih]

1.3 By the recursion, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F - n \cdot 1_F = 1_F > 0$, so $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$. [given, L1]

1.4 Additive identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ by the recursion, and if $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ then $(m+n+1) \cdot 1_F = (m+n) \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + (n+1) \cdot 1_F$. [given, algebra]

2.1 Inductive step: $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ is a sum of two positives, by the hypothesis and $1_F > 0$, hence $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Iterating 1.3, for $m < n$ one has $m \cdot 1_F < n \cdot 1_F$, so $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing and therefore injective on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$. [step 1.3, L2]

2.3 Multiplicative identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m \cdot 1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(1 \cdot 1_F)$, and the step $(m(n+1)) \cdot 1_F = (mn + m) \cdot 1_F = (mn) \cdot 1_F + m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F) + (m \cdot 1_F)(1_F) = (m \cdot 1_F)((n+1) \cdot 1_F)$ uses 1.4 and distributivity. [step 1.4, algebra]

3.1 By induction on 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for every $n \ge 1$; with the strict increase 2.2 and the identities 1.4, 2.3, every claim holds. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 1.4, step 2.3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

The map $q \mapsto \hat q$ ([[def-real-numbers]]) is an embedding of ordered
fields. Every real is approximated by rationals: for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and
rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ with
$|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$. Consequently, strictly between any two
reals lies a rational.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real $x = [(a_n)]$ and a rational $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] The orders of $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}$; ordered-field arithmetic ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Field arithmetic in $\mathbb{Q}$: $\varepsilon/2, \delta/4$ are positive rationals, and every nonzero rational $q$ has a reciprocal $1/q$ with $q \cdot (1/q) = 1$ ([[thm-rat-field]]).

[L3] Cauchy definition ([[def-rational-cauchy-sequence]]).

[L4] Real positivity via eventual rational lower bounds ([[def-real-order]]).

[L5] $\mathbb{R} = \mathcal{C}/\mathcal{N}$ is a field ([[thm-reals-field]]), and $0_{\mathbb{R}} = \hat 0$, $1_{\mathbb{R}} = \hat 1$ are the classes of the constant sequences ([[def-real-numbers]]). A multiplicative inverse there is unique: if $ab = 1_{\mathbb{R}} = ac$ then $b = b(ac) = (ba)c = c$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Embedding: constant sequences are Cauchy; $\hat q = \hat r$ iff the constant $q - r$ is null iff $q = r$; operations match termwise; and $q < r$ gives the constant lower bound $r - q > 0$, so $\hat q < \hat r$ and order is preserved and reflected. [L1, L4]

1.2 Fix $N$ with $|a_m - a_n| < \varepsilon/2$ for all $m, n \ge N$, and set $q = a_N$. [L3, L2]

2.1 The difference $\hat q - x$ has representative $(a_N - a_n)$ with $|a_N - a_n| < \varepsilon/2$ for $n \ge N$; hence both $\hat\varepsilon - (x - \hat q)$ and $\hat\varepsilon - (\hat q - x)$ have representatives eventually $> \varepsilon/2$, so both are positive: $|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$. [step 1.2, L4, L1]

2.2 Inverses: let $q$ be a nonzero rational. Then $\hat q \ne \hat 0 = 0_{\mathbb{R}}$ by the injectivity of step 1.1, and $1/q$ exists in $\mathbb{Q}$ by [L2]; since the operations match termwise (step 1.1), $\hat q \cdot \widehat{1/q} = \widehat{q \cdot (1/q)} = \hat 1 = 1_{\mathbb{R}}$. Inverses in $\mathbb{R}$ are unique by [L5], so $(\hat q)^{-1} = \widehat{1/q}$: the embedding preserves reciprocals. [step 1.1, L2, L5]

3.1 Density: let $x < y$; pick $\delta > 0$ rational and $N$ with the representative of $y - x$ eventually $> \delta$; set $\varepsilon = \delta/4$ and pick $q$ with $|x - \hat q| < \hat\varepsilon$; then $q' = q + 2\varepsilon$ satisfies $\hat q' - x \ge -\hat\varepsilon + 2\hat\varepsilon = \hat\varepsilon > 0$ and $y - \hat q' \ge \hat\delta - \hat\varepsilon - 2\hat\varepsilon = \hat\delta/4 > 0$, so $x < \hat q' < y$. [step 2.1, L4, L1, L2]

4.1 The rationals embed as an ordered subfield — injectively, preserving the order in both directions, the ring operations, and reciprocals — and they approximate every real arbitrarily well and separate any two reals. [step 1.1, step 2.2, step 3.1] ∎

## Statement

Let $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be additive ([[def-additive-function]]) and
put $c := f(1)$. Write $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ for the set of functions
$2 \to \mathbb{R}$ with the metric
$d_\infty\bigl((a,b),(a',b')\bigr) = \max\{|a-a'|,\ |b-b'|\}$
([[lem-metrics-on-rn]], [[def-metric-space]]), and let

$$\Gamma \;:=\; \{\, (x, f(x)) \;:\; x \in \mathbb{R} \,\} \;\subseteq\; \mathbb{R}^{2}$$

be the graph of $f$. If **any one** of the following six conditions holds, then
$f(x) = c\,x$ for every real $x$.

1. $f$ is continuous at some single point of $\mathbb{R}$
   ([[def-continuity-real]]).
2. $f$ is monotone on some nondegenerate interval
   ([[def-monotone-function]], [[def-interval]]).
3. $f$ is bounded above on some nondegenerate interval ([[def-bounded-set]]).
4. $f$ is bounded below on some nondegenerate interval.
5. $f$ has constant sign on some nondegenerate interval $I$: either $f(z) \ge 0$
   for every $z \in I$, or $f(z) \le 0$ for every $z \in I$.
6. $\Gamma$ is **not** dense in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$
   ([[def-metric-interior-closure-boundary]]).

**Conditions 3, 4 and 5 are not independent, and the proof does not pretend they
are.** Condition 5 is the special case of 3 or of 4 with the bound $0$, and
condition 4 is condition 3 applied to $-f$; they are listed separately only
because each is the form in which the hypothesis usually arises. Condition 1 and
condition 2 are each reduced to condition 3 in one line. Condition 6 is the only
one that is not, and it is proved in the contrapositive: if $f$ is not of the
form $x \mapsto cx$, then $\Gamma$ is dense.

**Two classical clauses are absent.** *Boundedness on a set of positive measure*
and *Lebesgue measurability* also force linearity, and neither is stated here:
both require a measure, and this library develops none as it stands. Each is an
independent sufficient condition, so restoring them would change nothing else on
this page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An additive $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ with $c := f(1)$, and its graph $\Gamma = \{(x,f(x)) : x \in \mathbb{R}\}$.

[A1] $f(x+y) = f(x)+f(y)$ for all reals $x, y$ ([[def-additive-function]]).

[L1] An additive $f$ satisfies $f(0)=0$, $f(-x) = -f(x)$ and $f(qx) = qf(x)$ for every rational $q$ and every real $x$ ([[lem-additive-is-q-linear]]).

[L2] If an additive $g$ is bounded above on some $[p,r]$ with $p < r$, then $g(x) = g(1)x$ for every real $x$ ([[lem-additive-bounded-above-on-an-interval-is-linear]]).

[L3] A nondegenerate interval contains a closed $[p,r]$ with $p < r$, by order-convexity ([[def-interval]]).

[L4] $f$ continuous at $c_{0}$ means: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ with $|f(x) - f(c_{0})| < \varepsilon$ whenever $|x - c_{0}| < \delta$; and $|u| < \varepsilon$ gives $u < \varepsilon$ ([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L5] $f$ nondecreasing on $I$ means $f(x) \le f(y)$ for $x \le y$ in $I$, and nonincreasing means $f(x) \ge f(y)$; monotone means one of the two ([[def-monotone-function]]).

[L6] $d_\infty$ is a metric on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and its open ball of centre $(a,b)$ and radius $\varepsilon$ is $\{(u,v) : |u-a| < \varepsilon \text{ and } |v-b| < \varepsilon\}$; a subset $S$ of a metric space is dense exactly when every open ball meets $S$ ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]], [[def-metric-ball]], [[def-metric-interior-closure-boundary]], [[thm-metric-closure-characterisation]]).

[L7] Strictly between any two distinct reals there lies a rational; $\mathbb{R}$ is a field, so a nonzero real is invertible ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Assume at least one of the six conditions holds. The six steps below treat the six conditions in turn and are exhaustive for that assumption; in each the conclusion reached is $f(x) = cx$ for every real $x$. [construct]

2.1 **Condition 3.** If $f$ is bounded above on a nondegenerate interval, that interval contains a closed $[p,r]$ with $p < r$ on which $f$ is bounded above, and the boundedness lemma gives $f(x) = f(1)x = cx$ for every real $x$. [step 1.1, L2, L3, assume-case above]

2.2 **Condition 6, in the contrapositive: if $f$ is not $x \mapsto cx$ then $\Gamma$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$.** Suppose $f(x_{2}) \ne c\,x_{2}$ for some real $x_{2}$. Then $x_{2} \ne 0$, since $f(0) = 0$. Put $x_{1} := 1$, $v_{1} := (x_{1}, f(x_{1})) = (1, c)$ and $v_{2} := (x_{2}, f(x_{2}))$, and put $\Delta := x_{1}f(x_{2}) - x_{2}f(x_{1}) = f(x_{2}) - c\,x_{2}$, which is nonzero by assumption. [step 1.1, L1, assume-case graph]

3.1 **Condition 4.** If $f$ is bounded below on a nondegenerate interval $I$, say $f(z) \ge m$ for $z \in I$, then $-f$ is additive and satisfies $-f(z) \le -m$ on $I$, so $-f$ is bounded above on $I$; by step 2.1 applied to $-f$ we get $-f(x) = (-f)(1)\,x = -cx$, hence $f(x) = cx$. [step 2.1, A1, assume-case below]

3.2 **Condition 2.** Let $f$ be monotone on a nondegenerate interval, which contains $[p,r]$ with $p < r$. If $f$ is nondecreasing there then $f(z) \le f(r)$ for every $z \in [p,r]$, and if $f$ is nonincreasing there then $f(z) \le f(p)$; either way $f$ is bounded above on $[p,r]$ and step 2.1 applies. [step 2.1, L3, L5, assume-case mono]

3.3 **Condition 1.** Let $f$ be continuous at a point $c_{0}$. Taking $\varepsilon := 1$ gives a real $\delta > 0$ with $|f(x) - f(c_{0})| < 1$, hence $f(x) < f(c_{0}) + 1$, for every $x$ with $|x - c_{0}| < \delta$. The set of such $x$ is the nondegenerate interval $(c_{0}-\delta,\ c_{0}+\delta)$, so $f$ is bounded above on a nondegenerate interval and step 2.1 applies. [step 2.1, L3, L4, assume-case cont]

3.4 Let $(a,b) \in \mathbb{R}^{2}$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real. Put $\alpha := (a\,f(x_{2}) - b\,x_{2})/\Delta$ and $\beta := (b\,x_{1} - a\,f(x_{1}))/\Delta$. Then $\alpha x_{1} + \beta x_{2} = a$ and $\alpha f(x_{1}) + \beta f(x_{2}) = b$, as multiplying out and cancelling $\Delta$ shows in each case. [step 2.2, L7]

4.1 **Condition 5.** If $f(z) \ge 0$ for every $z$ in a nondegenerate interval $I$ then $f$ is bounded below on $I$ by $0$ and step 3.1 applies; if $f(z) \le 0$ for every $z \in I$ then $f$ is bounded above on $I$ by $0$ and step 2.1 applies. So sign-constancy is a special case of the two preceding conditions and needs no separate argument. [step 2.1, step 3.1, assume-case sign]

4.2 Choose rationals $q_{1}, q_{2}$ with $|q_{1} - \alpha| < \eta$ and $|q_{2} - \beta| < \eta$, where $\eta > 0$ is a real chosen with $\eta\,(|x_{1}| + |x_{2}|) < \varepsilon$ and $\eta\,(|f(x_{1})| + |f(x_{2})|) < \varepsilon$; such rationals exist because a rational lies strictly between any two distinct reals, and such an $\eta$ exists because for a real $K \ge 0$ the inequality $\eta K < \varepsilon$ holds for all small enough $\eta > 0$. [step 3.4, L7]

5.1 Put $x := q_{1}x_{1} + q_{2}x_{2}$. Then $f(x) = q_{1}f(x_{1}) + q_{2}f(x_{2})$ by additivity and rational homogeneity, so $(x, f(x)) \in \Gamma$. Moreover $|x - a| = |(q_{1}-\alpha)x_{1} + (q_{2}-\beta)x_{2}| \le \eta(|x_{1}| + |x_{2}|) < \varepsilon$ and likewise $|f(x) - b| \le \eta(|f(x_{1})| + |f(x_{2})|) < \varepsilon$. [step 3.4, step 4.2, A1, L1, L7]

6.1 So every open ball of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ meets $\Gamma$, that is, $\Gamma$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Reading this contrapositively: if $\Gamma$ is not dense in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ then $f(x) = cx$ for every real $x$, which is condition 6. [step 2.2, step 5.1, L6]

7.1 Each of the six conditions has now been shown to force $f(x) = cx$ for every real $x$: condition 1 at step 3.3, condition 2 at step 3.2, condition 3 at step 2.1, condition 4 at step 3.1, condition 5 at step 4.1 and condition 6 at step 6.1. [step 2.1, step 3.1, step 4.1, step 3.2, step 3.3, step 6.1, cases-exhaustive] ∎

## Remarks

- **Every clause reduces to one lemma.** The engine is
  [[lem-additive-bounded-above-on-an-interval-is-linear]]; five of the six
  conditions are shown to imply its hypothesis, and the sixth is proved
  separately because a non-dense graph gives no bound on $f$ anywhere. The
  economy is deliberate: proving each clause from scratch would repeat the same
  translation-and-scaling argument five times.

- **The list is not a list of equivalent conditions.** Each of the six implies
  linearity, and linearity implies all six, so over the additive functions they
  are indeed equivalent; but the theorem as stated is six implications in one
  direction, and that is what the proof establishes.

- **None of the six is dispensable in the sense that additivity alone suffices.**
  There is an additive $f$ satisfying none of them
  ([[fs-additive-implies-linear]]), and by the theorem it is unbounded above and
  below on every nondegenerate interval, monotone on none, continuous at no
  point, of constant sign on no nondegenerate interval, and has dense graph. The
  construction costs the Axiom of Choice, and the companion page records what it
  looks like.

## Statement

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. If $0 \in S$ and $\sigma(n) \in S$ whenever $n \in S$, then $S = \mathbb{N}$. Equivalently (property form): if a property $P$ satisfies $P(0)$ and ($P(n) \Rightarrow P(\sigma(n))$) for all $n$, then $P(n)$ holds for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. This is the induction principle, the basis of proof by induction.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $\mathbb{N} = \omega$ is the smallest inductive set ([[def-inductive-set]], [[def-natural-numbers]], [[lem-omega-smallest-inductive]]); $0 = \varnothing$, $\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$.

[L1] $\omega$ is contained in every inductive set ([[lem-omega-smallest-inductive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Suppose $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ with $0 = \varnothing \in S$ and ($x \in S \Rightarrow \sigma(x) = x \cup \{x\} \in S$). [given]

2.1 Then $S$ contains $\varnothing$ and is closed under $x \mapsto x \cup \{x\}$, so $S$ is an inductive set. [step 1.1]

3.1 $\mathbb{N} = \omega \subseteq S$ because $\omega$ is a subset of every inductive set. [L1, step 2.1]

4.1 With $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ by hypothesis, $S = \mathbb{N}$. [step 3.1, given]

5.1 The property form is the set case with $S = \{n \in \mathbb{N} : P(n)\}$: $P(0)$ and $P(n) \Rightarrow P(\sigma(n))$ give $0 \in S$ and $\sigma$-closure, so $S = \mathbb{N}$, i.e. $P$ holds for all $n$; conversely the set form is the property form applied to $P(n) :\equiv n \in S$, so the two are equivalent. [step 4.1] ∎
