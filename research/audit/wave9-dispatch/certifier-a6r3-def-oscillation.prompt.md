You are **GPT 5.6 Terra** at `xhigh` effort with a 1,000,000-token context
window. You are an independent, read-only certifier of a repair you did not
author.

## Binding triage

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes within 30 seconds; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the assigned target's exact current final text from disk and compare its
hash with the dispatch task. For an item, read every dependency needed for the
repaired inference, the title/public statement, every numbered step, Facts &
Assumptions, Remarks, dependency list, provenance tags, sources, and
verification block. Check the named baseline defect is fixed without a new
one and that stale pre-repair judge/audited evidence is absent. Use web access
when an external source is material. For the repaired page, read the complete
current page and all current items it summarizes; pages have no item stamp.

Return exactly:

```text
ITEM: <id-or-page-path>
VERDICT: CERTIFIED | REFUSED | BLOCKED
CURRENT-TEXT: READ
MATHEMATICS: [concise evidence]
CITATIONS: [concise evidence]
METADATA: [provenance/dependencies/stale-verdict disposition, or n/a for page]
FINDINGS: NONE | [fatal defect or concrete blocker]
```

Do not suggest optional polishing and do not write a verification stamp.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$. All suprema and
infima below are taken in the extended real line
$\overline{\mathbb{R}} = \mathbb{R} \cup \{-\infty, +\infty\}$
([[def-extended-reals]]), where **every** subset has a least upper bound and a
greatest lower bound ([[lem-extended-reals-complete]]); no boundedness
hypothesis on $f$ is therefore needed anywhere, and none is imposed.

**Oscillation on a set.** For $S \subseteq A$ put

$$\omega_f(S) \;:=\; \sup\{\, |f(x) - f(y)| \;:\; x, y \in S \,\} \;\in\; \overline{\mathbb{R}} .$$

**Oscillation at a point.** For $c \in A$ put

$$\omega_f(c) \;:=\; \inf\{\, \omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c)) \;:\; \delta \in \mathbb{R},\ \delta > 0 \,\} \;\in\; \overline{\mathbb{R}},$$

where $N_\delta(c) = (c - \delta, c + \delta)$ is the $\delta$-neighbourhood of
$c$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

The two uses of the symbol $\omega_f$ are distinguished by their argument: a
subset of $A$ in the first, a point of $A$ in the second. Where confusion is
possible the first is written $\omega_f(S)$ with $S$ named as a set.

### Both values are well posed; point oscillation and nonempty-set oscillation are nonnegative

**The set in the first display is nonempty whenever $S$ is**, since $x = y \in S$
gives the value $|f(x) - f(x)| = 0$; so $\omega_f(S) \ge 0$ for nonempty $S$,
and $\omega_f(S) = \sup \varnothing = -\infty$ for $S = \varnothing$
([[lem-extended-reals-complete]]). Only nonempty $S$ occurs below.

**The set in the second display is nonempty**, since some real $\delta > 0$
exists, and each of its members is $\ge 0$: for $c \in A$ the set
$A \cap N_\delta(c)$ contains $c$ itself, because $|c - c| = 0 < \delta$, so it
is nonempty and $\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c)) \ge 0$
([[lem-of-abs-value]]). Hence $0$ is a lower bound of that set and

$$0 \;\le\; \omega_f(c) \;\le\; \omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c)) \qquad \text{for every real } \delta > 0,$$

the second inequality because $\omega_f(c)$ is a lower bound of the set of which
$\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c))$ is a member. In particular $\omega_f(c)$ is never
$-\infty$.

### Monotonicity, and the case of a bounded $f$

**$\omega_f$ is monotone under inclusion.** If $S \subseteq T \subseteq A$ then
every value $|f(x) - f(y)|$ with $x, y \in S$ is also a value with $x, y \in T$,
so the first set of values is contained in the second and
$\omega_f(S) \le \omega_f(T)$: a supremum of a subset is at most the supremum of
the set. Consequently $\delta \mapsto \omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c))$ is
nondecreasing in $\delta$, since $\delta \le \delta'$ gives
$N_\delta(c) \subseteq N_{\delta'}(c)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

**When $f$ is bounded, nonempty-set and point oscillations are real.** Suppose
there is a real $M$ with $|f(x)| \le M$ for every $x \in A$
([[def-bounded-set]]). Then for $x, y \in A$,

$$|f(x) - f(y)| \;\le\; |f(x)| + |f(y)| \;\le\; 2M$$

([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]), so $\omega_f(S) \le 2M$
for every $S \subseteq A$. If
$S$ is nonempty, $\omega_f(S)$ is a real number in $[0,2M]$, and every point
oscillation is also a real number in $[0,2M]$: the supremum of a nonempty
subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$ is the real
supremum ([[lem-extended-reals-complete]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]],
[[def-infimum]]). The convention $\omega_f(\varnothing)=-\infty$ remains the
single empty-set exception. Apart from that exception, an infinite extended
value can occur only when $f$ is unbounded.

**The notation.** The letter is $\omega$ throughout this library, never
"$\operatorname{osc}$", and the function is always in the subscript.
