## Statement

Assuming choice, every $\chi(x,X)$ and the raw supremum $\chi(X)$ are well-defined cardinals.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A space $X$, a point $x\in X$, and the definitions in [[def-weight-density-and-character]].

[L1] Under choice every set can be well ordered and therefore has a cardinality ([[thm-well-ordering-theorem]], [[lem-cardinality-of-a-well-orderable-set]]).

[L2] Every nonempty set of ordinals, and hence every nonempty set of cardinals, has a least member ([[lem-ordinal-trichotomy]]).

[L3] Cardinals are initial ordinals, a set of ordinals has union as its least upper bound, and mutual injections give a bijection ([[def-cardinal]], [[lem-ordinal-basics]], [[thm-schroder-bernstein]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The neighbourhood filter at $x$ is a local base, so local-base cardinalities form a nonempty set. [given]

2.1 The candidate cardinalities are ordinals, so their nonempty set has a least member, namely $\chi(x,X)$. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

3.1 Let $K=\{\chi(x,X):x\in X\}$ and $\delta=\bigcup K$. This is an ordinal and the least ordinal upper bound of $K$ by [L3]. It is a cardinal: if $\beta<\delta$ and $\beta\approx\delta$, choose $\kappa\in K$ with $\beta<\kappa\le\delta$. Then $\beta\preceq\kappa\preceq\delta\approx\beta$, so [L3] gives $\beta\approx\kappa$, contradicting that $\kappa$ is a cardinal. Thus $\delta$ is the cardinal supremum $\chi(X)$. [L3] ∎

## The dependencies it declares, quoted verbatim from disk

Each block below is the claim-bearing text of one declared dependency.
These are the only statements the item is entitled to use. If a step
needs more than the text below gives, that is the defect — quote the
dependency text and show exactly what it fails to supply.

### `def-weight-density-and-character` — definition — Under choice, weight $w(X)$, density $d(X)$, local character $\\chi(x,X)$, and character $\\chi(X)$ as raw cardinal minima and a supremum

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Assume the Axiom of Choice ([[def-axiom-of-choice]]) and let $X$ be a topological space. The **weight** $w(X)$ is the least cardinality of a basis for $X$, and the **density** $d(X)$ is the least cardinality of a dense subset of $X$ ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]], [[def-dense-top]], [[def-cardinal]]).

For $x\in X$, the **local character** $\chi(x,X)$ is the least cardinality of a neighbourhood base at $x$ ([[def-neighbourhood-top]]). The **character** is the raw cardinal supremum
$$\chi(X)=\sup\{\chi(x,X):x\in X\}.$$

No $\aleph_0$ normalization is imposed. In particular a one-member local base has cardinality $1$, not $\aleph_0$. The forward lemmas named in `justified_by` establish the asserted minima and supremum.

### `thm-well-ordering-theorem` — theorem — The well-ordering theorem

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Statement

Assume the Axiom of Choice ([[def-axiom-of-choice]]). Then **every set $X$ can
be well ordered**: there is a relation on $X$ making it a well-ordered set
([[def-well-order]]).

The Axiom of Choice is used only inside [[thm-zorn]], and nowhere else in the
argument below.

### `lem-cardinality-of-a-well-orderable-set` — lemma — A set equinumerous with some ordinal has a least such ordinal, that ordinal is a cardinal, and equinumerous sets get the same one; no choice principle is used

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Call a set $X$ **well-orderable** when some relation well-orders it
([[def-well-order]]). Work in ZF, with no choice principle. Then:

**(a)** $X$ is well-orderable if and only if $X \approx \alpha$
([[def-equinumerous]]) for some ordinal $\alpha$ ([[def-ordinal]]).

**(b)** If $X$ is well-orderable there is a **least** ordinal equinumerous with
$X$. It is written $\lvert X \rvert$ and called the **cardinality** of $X$.

**(c)** $\lvert X \rvert$ is a cardinal ([[def-cardinal]]).

**(d)** If $X \approx Y$ and $X$ is well-orderable, then $Y$ is well-orderable
and $\lvert Y \rvert = \lvert X \rvert$.

**(e)** $\lvert \alpha \rvert \le \alpha$ for every ordinal $\alpha$, and
$\lvert \alpha \rvert = \alpha$ exactly when $\alpha$ is a cardinal.

Assuming the Axiom of Choice ([[def-axiom-of-choice]]) every set is
well-orderable ([[thm-well-ordering-theorem]]), so $\lvert X \rvert$ is then
defined for every set and is exactly the cardinality of [[def-cardinal]].

**Why this item exists.** [[def-cardinal]] introduces $\lvert X \rvert$ under the
hypothesis "Assume the Axiom of Choice", and it needs that hypothesis only to
know that $X$ carries a well-order at all. Everything below is about
well-orderable sets and is a theorem of ZF, which is what makes it possible to
state Hessenberg's theorem and Tarski's theorem, one of which is choice-free and
the other of which is precisely about the gap between ZF and ZFC.

### `def-cardinal` — definition — Cardinal (initial ordinal) and cardinality

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Write $X \approx Y$, and say $X$ and $Y$ are **equinumerous**, when there is a
bijection $X \to Y$.

An ordinal $\kappa$ ([[def-ordinal]]) is a **cardinal**, equivalently an
**initial ordinal**, when

$$\text{no } \alpha \in \kappa \text{ satisfies } \alpha \approx \kappa,$$

that is, $\kappa$ is not equinumerous with any strictly smaller ordinal.

**Cardinality, under the Axiom of Choice.** Assume the Axiom of Choice
([[def-axiom-of-choice]]) and let $X$ be a set. Then $X$ carries a well-order
([[thm-well-ordering-theorem]]), which has an order type $\alpha$
([[thm-mostowski-collapse]]) and in particular $\alpha \approx X$. Now
$\alpha^{+} = \alpha \cup \{\alpha\}$ is an ordinal ([[lem-ordinal-basics]],
claim (c)) whose elements are ordinals (claim (a)) and which contains $\alpha$,
so $C = \{\xi \in \alpha^{+} : \xi \approx X\}$ is a nonempty set of ordinals and
has an $\in$-least element $\kappa$ ([[lem-ordinal-trichotomy]]). This $\kappa$ is the
**cardinality** of $X$, written $|X|$; it is a cardinal, because
$\beta \in \kappa$ with $\beta \approx \kappa \approx X$ would lie in
$\alpha^{+}$ and contradict the minimality of $\kappa$.

**Well-definedness: $\kappa$ does not depend on the well-order or on $\alpha$.**
The recipe above instantiates a well-order of $X$ and an order type $\alpha$ for
it, and $X$ will in general carry many well-orders with many different order
types, so the value $\kappa$ has to be shown independent of both. It is, because
$\kappa$ is in fact the least ordinal equinumerous with $X$ **outright**, a
description in which neither the well-order nor $\alpha$ appears. Let $\beta$ be
any ordinal with $\beta \approx X$. By trichotomy for ordinals
([[lem-ordinal-trichotomy]]) exactly one of $\beta \in \alpha^{+}$,
$\beta = \alpha^{+}$, $\alpha^{+} \in \beta$ holds. In the first case
$\beta \in C$, so $\kappa \subseteq \beta$ by minimality of $\kappa$. In the
other two cases claim (f) of [[lem-ordinal-basics]] gives
$\alpha^{+} \subseteq \beta$, and $\alpha \in \alpha^{+}$ because
$\alpha^{+} = \alpha \cup \{\alpha\}$, so $\alpha \in \beta$ and hence
$\alpha \subseteq \beta$ by claim (f) again; and $\alpha \in C$, so
$\kappa \subseteq \alpha$ by minimality, whence $\kappa \subseteq \beta$. In every case
$\kappa \subseteq \beta$, that is $\kappa \le \beta$. So $\kappa$ is the least
element of the collection of **all** ordinals equinumerous with $X$, and any two
runs of the recipe, from any two well-orders of $X$, return the same $\kappa$.

### `lem-ordinal-trichotomy` — lemma — Trichotomy and well-ordering of the ordinals

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Statement

For ordinals $\alpha$ and $\beta$ ([[def-ordinal]]), **exactly one** of

$$\alpha \in \beta, \qquad \alpha = \beta, \qquad \beta \in \alpha$$

holds. Moreover every nonempty **set** $A$ of ordinals has an $\in$-least
element, and consequently $A$ ordered by
$\alpha \le \beta :\iff \alpha \subseteq \beta$ is a well-order
([[def-well-order]]) whose strict part is membership.

So the ordinals are linearly ordered by $\in$, every set of them is well
ordered, and [[thm-transfinite-induction]] is available on any such set. No
choice principle is used.

### `lem-ordinal-basics` — lemma — Basic closure properties of ordinals

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be ordinals ([[def-ordinal]]). Then:

**(a)** every element of $\alpha$ is an ordinal;

**(b)** $\alpha \notin \alpha$;

**(c)** $\alpha^{+} = \alpha \cup \{\alpha\}$ is an ordinal;

**(d)** if $A$ is a **nonempty** set of ordinals then $\bigcap A$ is an ordinal;

**(e)** if $A$ is any set of ordinals then $\bigcup A$ is an ordinal;

**(f)** $\alpha \subseteq \beta$ if and only if $\alpha \in \beta$ or
$\alpha = \beta$;

**(g)** any two ordinals are comparable under inclusion: $\alpha \subseteq \beta$
or $\beta \subseteq \alpha$.

Everything here is a theorem of ZF and uses no choice principle.

### `thm-schroder-bernstein` — theorem — The Schröder-Bernstein theorem

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets with $A \preceq B$ and $B \preceq A$
([[def-equinumerous]]). Then $A \approx B$.

Equivalently: if there is an injection $A \to B$ and an injection $B \to A$, then
there is a bijection $A \to B$ ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

**The proof uses no choice principle.** The bijection is written down explicitly
from the two given injections, and the only "selections" it makes are of the
unique preimage of a point under an injection, which is determined, not chosen.
The single infinite construction is an application of the recursion theorem
([[thm-recursion]]), whose data are a set, a starting point and one function.
