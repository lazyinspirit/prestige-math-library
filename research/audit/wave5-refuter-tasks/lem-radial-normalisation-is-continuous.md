## Statement

For $n\ge1$, the map $\rho:\mathbb R^n\setminus\{0\}\to S^{n-1}$ defined by $\rho(x)=x/\lVert x\rVert_2$ is continuous.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $n\ge1$, the Euclidean norm, and a nonzero point $a\in\mathbb R^n$.

[L1] The Euclidean norm is continuous and satisfies $|\lVert u\rVert_2-\lVert v\rVert_2|\le\lVert u-v\rVert_2$ ([[lem-every-norm-on-rn-is-continuous-for-the-euclidean-metric]]).

[L2] Componentwise continuity gives continuity into $\mathbb R^n$ ([[thm-componentwise-limits-and-continuity]], [[def-vector-valued-functions-limits-and-continuity]]); and a map into a subspace is continuous exactly when its composite with the ambient inclusion is continuous, so a continuous map whose image lies in the subspace is continuous into it ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]).

[L3] The unit sphere is the set of vectors with Euclidean norm $1$ ([[def-euclidean-spheres-and-closed-balls]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Put $d:=\lVert a\rVert_2>0$. If $\lVert x-a\rVert_2<d/2$, then [L1] gives $\lVert x\rVert_2>d/2$. [L1]

1.2 For such $x$, $\lVert\rho(x)-\rho(a)\rVert_2\le\lVert x-a\rVert_2/\lVert x\rVert_2+\lVert a\rVert_2|1/\lVert x\rVert_2-1/\lVert a\rVert_2|\le4\lVert x-a\rVert_2/d$. [L1]

2.1 Step 1.2 gives the epsilon-delta condition at $a$, so $\rho$ is continuous on the punctured space. Also $\lVert\rho(x)\rVert_2=1$, so its image lies in $S^{n-1}$ and [L2] gives continuity with that codomain. [L2, L3, step 1.2] ∎

## The dependencies it declares, quoted verbatim from disk

Each block below is the claim-bearing text of one declared dependency.
These are the only statements the item is entitled to use. If a step
needs more than the text below gives, that is the defect — quote the
dependency text and show exactly what it fails to supply.

### `def-vector-valued-functions-limits-and-continuity` — definition — Vector-valued functions $f : A \\to \\mathbb{R}^m$, their limits and continuity, with the dictionary to the metric notions

(statement provenance: untagged)

### Definition

Throughout, $m \in \mathbb{N}$ with $m \ge 1$, and $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ carries the
Euclidean norm $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ of [[def-euclidean-inner-product]] and
[[def-p-norms-on-rn]], whose induced metric is the published $d_2$
([[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]],
[[lem-metrics-on-rn]]). A function into $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ is called
**vector-valued**.

### Continuity

Let $(X, d_X)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]), let $A \subseteq X$
carry the restricted metric $d_A$ ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]), let
$f : A \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$ and let $a \in A$. Then $f$ is **continuous at $a$**
when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ d_X(x,a) < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ \lVert f(x) - f(a)\rVert_2 < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

with $\varepsilon, \delta$ ranging over the positive reals, and **continuous on
$A$** when it is continuous at every point of $A$.

**This is not a new notion, and that is the point of writing it down.** Since
$\lVert f(x)-f(a)\rVert_2 = d_2\bigl(f(x),f(a)\bigr)$ and $d_A$ is the
restriction of $d_X$, the displayed condition is **verbatim** the condition of
[[def-metric-continuity]] for the map of metric spaces
$f : (A,d_A) \to (\mathbb{R}^{m}, d_2)$. So every theorem about continuous maps
of metric spaces applies to vector-valued functions with no translation, and
this library has exactly one notion of continuity here. The same move was made
once before, between the $\mathbb{R}$-native and the metric notions, in
[[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]]; this item is that move one dimension up in
the codomain.

The two cases used below are $X = \mathbb{R}$ with $d_{\mathbb{R}}(s,t) = |s-t|$
([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]) and $X = \mathbb{R}^{n}$ with $d_2$, for
$n \ge 1$.

### Limits, for a real domain

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$, let $c$ be a limit
point of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]) and let $L \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$. We say
$f(x)$ **tends to $L$ as $x$ tends to $c$**, and write
$\lim_{x\to c} f(x) = L$, when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ 0 < |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ \lVert f(x) - L\rVert_2 < \varepsilon\ \bigr].$$

This is the condition of [[def-function-limit]] with the absolute value in the
codomain replaced by $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$; as there, the puncture $0 < |x-c|$ is
what makes $c$ a point the function need not be defined at, and the hypothesis
that $c$ is a limit point of $A$ is what stops the condition from being satisfied
vacuously.

**The notation denotes: at most one $L$ satisfies the condition.** Suppose $L$
and $L'$ both do and $L \ne L'$. Then $\varepsilon := \lVert L-L'\rVert_2 / 2 > 0$
by (N1) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]). Take $\delta$
and $\delta'$ for this $\varepsilon$ and put $\eta := \min\{\delta,\delta'\} > 0$.
Since $c$ is a limit point of $A$ there is $x \in A$ with $0 < |x-c| < \eta$
([[def-limit-point-r]]), and then

$$\lVert L - L'\rVert_2 \;\le\; \lVert L - f(x)\rVert_2 + \lVert f(x) - L'\rVert_2 \;<\; \varepsilon + \varepsilon \;=\; \lVert L-L'\rVert_2$$

by (N3) and (N2), which trichotomy forbids. So $L = L'$.

### Components

For $i < m$ define the $i$-th **coordinate projection**
$\pi_i : \mathbb{R}^{m} \to \mathbb{R}$ by $\pi_i(y) := y_i = y(i)$, and for
$f : A \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$ the $i$-th **component** $f_i := \pi_i \circ f$, a
real-valued function on $A$.

**Each $\pi_i$ is $1$-Lipschitz** ([[def-lipschitz-holder-contraction]]): for
$y, z \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$,

$$\bigl|\pi_i(y) - \pi_i(z)\bigr| \;=\; |y_i - z_i| \;\le\; \lVert y - z\rVert_2 \;=\; d_2(y,z),$$

the middle inequality being $|w_i| \le \lVert w\rVert_2$ at $w := y-z$
([[lem-every-norm-on-rn-is-continuous-for-the-euclidean-metric]] clause 3, or
directly because $w_i^{2}$ is one term of the sum $\sum_{k<m}w_k^{2}$). Written
in coordinates, $f(x)$ is the vector whose $i$-th coordinate is $f_i(x)$, and
$f(x) = \sum_{i<m} f_i(x)\,e_i$ in the standard basis
([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]]).

### `thm-componentwise-limits-and-continuity` — theorem — A vector-valued function has a limit, or is continuous, if and only if each of its components does; with the algebra of continuous vector-valued functions

(statement provenance: untagged)

### Statement

Let $m \in \mathbb{N}$ with $m \ge 1$, with vector-valued functions, their
components $f_i = \pi_i \circ f$, their limits and their continuity as in
[[def-vector-valued-functions-limits-and-continuity]].

1. **Continuity is componentwise.** Let $(X,d_X)$ be a metric space, $A \subseteq X$,
   $f : A \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$ and $a \in A$. Then $f$ is continuous at $a$ if and
   only if every component $f_i : A \to \mathbb{R}$ $(i<m)$ is continuous at $a$.
2. **Limits are componentwise.** Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $c$ be a limit
   point of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]), let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$ and let
   $L \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$. Then $\lim_{x\to c} f(x) = L$ if and only if
   $\lim_{x\to c} f_i(x) = L_i$ for every $i<m$ ([[def-function-limit]]).
3. **Algebra.** Let $(X,d_X)$, $A$, $a$ be as in clause 1, let
   $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$ be continuous at $a$ and let $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$.
   Then $f + g$ and $\lambda f$ (defined pointwise) are continuous at $a$; the
   real-valued function $x \mapsto \langle f(x), g(x)\rangle$ is continuous at
   $a$ ([[def-euclidean-inner-product]]); and for every norm $N$ on
   $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ the real-valued function $x \mapsto N(f(x))$ is continuous at
   $a$ ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]).

**Where $m \ge 1$ is spent.** The "if" direction of clauses 1 and 2 divides
$\varepsilon$ by $\iota(m)$, which requires $\iota(m) \ne 0$; and clause 3's last
part quotes a bound available only for $m \ge 1$. The "only if" directions hold
for every $m$ but say nothing at $m = 0$, there being no index $i < 0$.

### `lem-every-norm-on-rn-is-continuous-for-the-euclidean-metric` — lemma — The finite and reverse triangle inequalities for a norm; and for $n \\ge 1$ every norm $N$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ satisfies $N(x) \\le C\\lVert x\\rVert_1$ and is Lipschitz, hence continuous, for $d_2$

(statement provenance: untagged)

### Statement

**Clause 1 is about an arbitrary norm; clauses 2 to 4 are about
$\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with $n \ge 1$.**

1. **Finite and reverse triangle inequalities.** Let $V$ be a vector space over
   $\mathbb{R}$ and $N$ a norm on it ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]). For every
   $p \in \mathbb{N}$ and every list $u : p \to V$
   ([[def-linear-combination-and-span]]),
   $$N\Bigl(\sum_{j<p} u_j\Bigr) \;\le\; \sum_{j<p} N(u_j),$$
   and for all $u, w \in V$,
   $$\bigl|N(u) - N(w)\bigr| \;\le\; N(u - w).$$

Now let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, let $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ carry the norms of
[[def-p-norms-on-rn]] and write $\iota$ for the canonical natural
([[def-canonical-natural]]).

2. **Every norm is dominated by the $1$-norm.** Let $N$ be a norm on
   $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and put $C := \max\{\, N(e_k) : k<n \,\}$, a maximum over a
   nonempty finite set of reals ([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]],
   [[lem-finite-set-has-max]]). Then $C \ge 0$ and
   $$N(x) \;\le\; C\,\lVert x\rVert_1 \qquad \text{for every } x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}.$$
3. **The comparison chain.** For every $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$,
   $$\lVert x\rVert_\infty \;\le\; \lVert x\rVert_2 \;\le\; \lVert x\rVert_1 \;\le\; \iota(n)\,\lVert x\rVert_\infty , \qquad \lVert x\rVert_1 \;\le\; \sqrt{\iota(n)}\;\lVert x\rVert_2 .$$
   In particular $\lVert\cdot\rVert_1$, $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ and
   $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ are pairwise equivalent norms on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$,
   with the constants displayed ([[def-equivalent-norms]]).
4. **Every norm is Lipschitz for the Euclidean metric.** With $N$ and $C$ as in
   clause 2, $N : (\mathbb{R}^{n}, d_2) \to (\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$ is
   Lipschitz with constant $C\sqrt{\iota(n)}$
   ([[def-lipschitz-holder-contraction]], [[lem-metrics-on-rn]],
   [[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]), hence uniformly continuous and
   continuous ([[thm-metric-regularity-hierarchy]], [[def-metric-continuity]]).

**Where $n \ge 1$ enters.** Clauses 2 and 4 need the maximum defining $C$ to
exist, and clause 3 mentions $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$; at $n = 0$ each is a
maximum over the empty index set and does not exist, exactly as in
[[lem-metrics-on-rn]] and [[def-p-norms-on-rn]]. Clause 1 carries no hypothesis
on the dimension and no hypothesis on the space.

### `def-euclidean-spheres-and-closed-balls` — definition — Euclidean spheres and closed balls as subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^n$

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$. Give $\mathbb{R}^n$ its Euclidean norm $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ and its induced Euclidean metric $d_2$ ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]], [[def-norm-and-normed-space]]). For $c \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $r>0$, put

$$\overline B_2(c,r):=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n:\lVert x-c\rVert_2\le r\},\qquad S_2(c,r):=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n:\lVert x-c\rVert_2=r\}.$$

These are respectively the **Euclidean closed ball** and **Euclidean sphere** with centre $c$ and radius $r$. They carry the subspace topology inherited from $\mathbb{R}^n$ ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]). Since $d_2(c,x)=\lVert x-c\rVert_2$, they are precisely the closed ball and sphere $\bar B(c,r)$ and $S(c,r)$ of the metric-space definition ([[def-metric-ball]]).

For the unit sphere centred at the origin write

$$S^{n-1}:=S_2(0,1).$$

The exponent is notation for this particular sphere, not a claim that a dimension theory has been developed here.

### `def-subspace-topology-top` — definition — Subspace topology: the traces of the open sets, its closed sets and its bases, the continuity of the inclusion, and the characteristic property of a map into a subspace

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]) and let
$S \subseteq X$. The **subspace topology** (also *relative topology*) on $S$ is

$$\mathcal{T}_S := \{\, U \cap S : U \in \mathcal{T} \,\},$$

the family of **traces** on $S$ of the open sets of $X$. The pair
$(S, \mathcal{T}_S)$ is a **subspace** of $X$. A subset of $S$ that lies in
$\mathcal{T}_S$ is said to be **open in $S$**, and *relatively open* where the
ambient space needs emphasis.

**$\mathcal{T}_S$ is a topology, and this is discharged here.** (T1):
$\varnothing = \varnothing \cap S$ and $S = X \cap S$ are traces. (T2): if
$\mathcal{S}' \subseteq \mathcal{T}_S$, choose for each member a set of
$\mathcal{T}$ tracing to it — no choice principle is needed, since
$U' := \bigcup \{\, U \in \mathcal{T} : U \cap S \subseteq W \,\}$ is a canonical
such set for $W \in \mathcal{T}_S$, being open by (T2) in $X$ and satisfying
$U' \cap S = W$ — and then
$\bigcup_i (U_i \cap S) = (\bigcup_i U_i) \cap S \in \mathcal{T}_S$ by (T2) in
$X$. (T3): $(U \cap S) \cap (V \cap S) = (U \cap V) \cap S \in \mathcal{T}_S$ by
(T3) in $X$.

**Closed sets of a subspace are the traces of the closed sets.** A set
$C \subseteq S$ is closed in $S$ if and only if $C = F \cap S$ for some closed
$F \subseteq X$. Indeed $S \setminus (U \cap S) = (X \setminus U) \cap S$ and
$S \setminus (F \cap S) = (X \setminus F) \cap S$, so complementation inside $S$
matches complementation inside $X$ under tracing.

**Bases and subbases trace as well.** If $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for
$\mathcal{T}$ ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]) then
$\mathcal{B}_S := \{\, B \cap S : B \in \mathcal{B} \,\}$ is a basis for
$\mathcal{T}_S$: its members are open in $S$, and for $W = U \cap S$ open in $S$
and $x \in W$ there is $B \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B \subseteq U$, whence
$x \in B \cap S \subseteq W$. The same computation with a subbasis $\mathcal{S}$
shows that $\{\, S_0 \cap S : S_0 \in \mathcal{S} \,\}$ is a subbasis for
$\mathcal{T}_S$, since tracing commutes with finite intersections and with
unions.

**The inclusion is continuous.** The inclusion map $\iota : S \to X$,
$\iota(s) = s$, satisfies $\iota^{-1}[U] = U \cap S$ for every $U \subseteq X$,
so preimages of open sets are open and $\iota$ is continuous
([[thm-continuity-characterisations-top]], clause (b)). Moreover
$\mathcal{T}_S$ is the **coarsest** topology on $S$ making $\iota$ continuous: any
topology on $S$ for which $\iota$ is continuous must contain every
$\iota^{-1}[U] = U \cap S$, hence contain $\mathcal{T}_S$.

**Characteristic property of a map into a subspace.** Let $(Z, \mathcal{T}_Z)$ be
a topological space and let $g : Z \to S$ be a function. Then

$$g \text{ is continuous as a map } Z \to (S,\mathcal{T}_S) \iff \iota \circ g \text{ is continuous as a map } Z \to (X,\mathcal{T}) .$$

*Proof.* For $U \in \mathcal{T}$ one has
$(\iota \circ g)^{-1}[U] = g^{-1}[\iota^{-1}[U]] = g^{-1}[U \cap S]$. If $g$ is
continuous then each $g^{-1}[U \cap S]$ is open, so $\iota \circ g$ is continuous;
conversely if $\iota \circ g$ is continuous then for any $W = U \cap S$ open in
$S$ the set $g^{-1}[W] = (\iota \circ g)^{-1}[U]$ is open, so $g$ is continuous.
Both directions use only clause (b) of [[thm-continuity-characterisations-top]].

**Restriction of a continuous map.** If $f : X \to Y$ is continuous and
$S \subseteq X$, then $f|_S : S \to Y$ is continuous, since
$(f|_S)^{-1}[V] = f^{-1}[V] \cap S$ is open in $S$ for every open $V \subseteq Y$
([[def-continuous-map-top]], [[thm-continuity-characterisations-top]]).

**When relative and ambient agree.** If $S$ is open in $X$ then a subset of $S$
is open in $S$ if and only if it is open in $X$: a trace $U \cap S$ is then an
intersection of two open sets of $X$, and conversely an open subset of $X$
contained in $S$ is its own trace. The same statement with "closed" throughout
holds when $S$ is closed in $X$. Both are used in the pasting lemma of the next
item, and both fail without the hypothesis: $S$ itself is always open and closed
in $S$, and need be neither in $X$.
