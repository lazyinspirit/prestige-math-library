## Statement

Assuming choice, $L(X)$ is a well-defined cardinal.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A topological space $X$ and the definition in [[def-lindelof-degree-and-cellularity]].

[A1] Under choice every set has a cardinality ([[def-cardinal]], [[thm-well-ordering-theorem]]).

[L1] Every nonempty set of ordinals, and hence every nonempty set of cardinals, has a least member; this is a theorem of ZF ([[lem-ordinal-trichotomy]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [A1], the topology $\tau$ has a cardinality $\kappa$. Every open cover is a subcover of itself and has cardinality at most $\kappa$, so $\kappa$ bounds every cover's subcover size. [A1, given]

2.1 Let $S$ be the set of cardinals $\lambda\leq\kappa$ such that every open cover of $X$ has a subcover of cardinality at most $\lambda$. By Step 1.1, $\kappa\in S$, so [L1] supplies a least member of $S$. Any bounding cardinal larger than $\kappa$ cannot be smaller than that member, and hence this least member is exactly $L(X)$. [step 1.1, L1] ∎

## The dependencies it declares, quoted verbatim from disk

Each block below is the claim-bearing text of one declared dependency.
These are the only statements the item is entitled to use. If a step
needs more than the text below gives, that is the defect — quote the
dependency text and show exactly what it fails to supply.

### `def-lindelof-degree-and-cellularity` — definition — Under choice, Lindelöf degree $L(X)$ and cellularity $c(X)$ as raw cardinal functions

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Assume the Axiom of Choice ([[def-axiom-of-choice]]). The **Lindelöf degree** $L(X)$ is the least cardinal $\kappa$ such that every open cover of $X$ has a subcover of cardinality at most $\kappa$. The **cellularity** $c(X)$ is the cardinal supremum of the cardinalities of pairwise-disjoint families of nonempty open subsets of $X$.

These are raw cardinal functions. Thus finite covers and finite cellular families retain their finite cardinalities. Their well-definedness is supplied by the forward lemmas named in `justified_by`.

### `def-cardinal` — definition — Cardinal (initial ordinal) and cardinality

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Write $X \approx Y$, and say $X$ and $Y$ are **equinumerous**, when there is a
bijection $X \to Y$.

An ordinal $\kappa$ ([[def-ordinal]]) is a **cardinal**, equivalently an
**initial ordinal**, when

$$\text{no } \alpha \in \kappa \text{ satisfies } \alpha \approx \kappa,$$

that is, $\kappa$ is not equinumerous with any strictly smaller ordinal.

**Cardinality, under the Axiom of Choice.** Assume the Axiom of Choice
([[def-axiom-of-choice]]) and let $X$ be a set. Then $X$ carries a well-order
([[thm-well-ordering-theorem]]), which has an order type $\alpha$
([[thm-mostowski-collapse]]) and in particular $\alpha \approx X$. Now
$\alpha^{+} = \alpha \cup \{\alpha\}$ is an ordinal ([[lem-ordinal-basics]],
claim (c)) whose elements are ordinals (claim (a)) and which contains $\alpha$,
so $C = \{\xi \in \alpha^{+} : \xi \approx X\}$ is a nonempty set of ordinals and
has an $\in$-least element $\kappa$ ([[lem-ordinal-trichotomy]]). This $\kappa$ is the
**cardinality** of $X$, written $|X|$; it is a cardinal, because
$\beta \in \kappa$ with $\beta \approx \kappa \approx X$ would lie in
$\alpha^{+}$ and contradict the minimality of $\kappa$.

**Well-definedness: $\kappa$ does not depend on the well-order or on $\alpha$.**
The recipe above instantiates a well-order of $X$ and an order type $\alpha$ for
it, and $X$ will in general carry many well-orders with many different order
types, so the value $\kappa$ has to be shown independent of both. It is, because
$\kappa$ is in fact the least ordinal equinumerous with $X$ **outright**, a
description in which neither the well-order nor $\alpha$ appears. Let $\beta$ be
any ordinal with $\beta \approx X$. By trichotomy for ordinals
([[lem-ordinal-trichotomy]]) exactly one of $\beta \in \alpha^{+}$,
$\beta = \alpha^{+}$, $\alpha^{+} \in \beta$ holds. In the first case
$\beta \in C$, so $\kappa \subseteq \beta$ by minimality of $\kappa$. In the
other two cases claim (f) of [[lem-ordinal-basics]] gives
$\alpha^{+} \subseteq \beta$, and $\alpha \in \alpha^{+}$ because
$\alpha^{+} = \alpha \cup \{\alpha\}$, so $\alpha \in \beta$ and hence
$\alpha \subseteq \beta$ by claim (f) again; and $\alpha \in C$, so
$\kappa \subseteq \alpha$ by minimality, whence $\kappa \subseteq \beta$. In every case
$\kappa \subseteq \beta$, that is $\kappa \le \beta$. So $\kappa$ is the least
element of the collection of **all** ordinals equinumerous with $X$, and any two
runs of the recipe, from any two well-orders of $X$, return the same $\kappa$.

### `thm-well-ordering-theorem` — theorem — The well-ordering theorem

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Statement

Assume the Axiom of Choice ([[def-axiom-of-choice]]). Then **every set $X$ can
be well ordered**: there is a relation on $X$ making it a well-ordered set
([[def-well-order]]).

The Axiom of Choice is used only inside [[thm-zorn]], and nowhere else in the
argument below.

### `lem-ordinal-trichotomy` — lemma — Trichotomy and well-ordering of the ordinals

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Statement

For ordinals $\alpha$ and $\beta$ ([[def-ordinal]]), **exactly one** of

$$\alpha \in \beta, \qquad \alpha = \beta, \qquad \beta \in \alpha$$

holds. Moreover every nonempty **set** $A$ of ordinals has an $\in$-least
element, and consequently $A$ ordered by
$\alpha \le \beta :\iff \alpha \subseteq \beta$ is a well-order
([[def-well-order]]) whose strict part is membership.

So the ordinals are linearly ordered by $\in$, every set of them is well
ordered, and [[thm-transfinite-induction]] is available on any such set. No
choice principle is used.
