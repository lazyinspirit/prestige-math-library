## Statement

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]). Then:

1. If $X$ is Urysohn ([[def-urysohn-space]]) then $X$ is Hausdorff
   ([[def-hausdorff-space]]).
2. If $X$ is Hausdorff then $X$ is $T_1$, and hence $T_0$
   ([[def-t0-and-t1-spaces]]).
3. If $X$ is regular ([[def-regular-and-t3-spaces]]) and $T_1$ — that is, if $X$
   is $T_3$ — then $X$ is Urysohn.

Consequently $T_3$ implies $T_{2\frac12}$, which implies $T_2$, which implies
$T_1$, which implies $T_0$. Nothing here asserts that any of the four
implications reverses; two of the failures are recorded among this page's false
statements.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A topological space $(X,\mathcal{T})$ and points $x, y \in X$ with $x \ne y$.

[A1] $X$ is Urysohn when distinct points have open neighbourhoods with disjoint closures ([[def-urysohn-space]]).

[A2] $X$ is Hausdorff when distinct points have disjoint open neighbourhoods ([[def-hausdorff-space]]).

[A3] $X$ is $T_1$ when for distinct $x, y$ there are open $U \ni x$ with $y \notin U$ and open $V \ni y$ with $x \notin V$; every $T_1$ space is $T_0$ ([[def-t0-and-t1-spaces]]).

[L1] In a $T_1$ space every singleton is closed ([[thm-t1-iff-singletons-are-closed]], clause (b)).

[L2] $X$ is regular exactly when for every $x$ and every open $U \ni x$ there is an open $V$ with $x \in V \subseteq \overline{V} \subseteq U$ ([[lem-regularity-via-closed-neighbourhoods]], clause (b)).

[L3] $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ for every $A \subseteq X$, and a set is closed exactly when its complement is open ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]], [[def-topological-space]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume $X$ is Urysohn and let $x \ne y$; [A1] gives open $U \ni x$ and $V \ni y$ with $\overline{U} \cap \overline{V} = \varnothing$. [A1, assume-hyp]

1.2 Assume $X$ is Hausdorff and let $x \ne y$; [A2] gives disjoint open $U \ni x$ and $V \ni y$. [A2, assume-hyp]

1.3 Assume $X$ is regular and $T_1$ and let $x \ne y$; by [L1] the set $\{y\}$ is closed, so $U_0 := X \setminus \{y\}$ is open by [L3] and contains $x$. [L1, L3, assume-hyp]

2.1 Under step 1.1: $U \cap V \subseteq \overline{U} \cap \overline{V} = \varnothing$ by [L3], so $U$ and $V$ are disjoint open neighbourhoods of $x$ and $y$ and $X$ is Hausdorff, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, A2, L3]

2.2 Under step 1.2: $y \notin U$ and $x \notin V$, since $U \cap V = \varnothing$ with $y \in V$ and $x \in U$; so $U$ and $V$ witness the $T_1$ condition and $X$ is $T_1$, hence $T_0$, which is claim 2. [step 1.2, A3]

2.3 Under step 1.3: [L2] applied to $x \in U_0$ gives an open $U$ with $x \in U \subseteq \overline{U} \subseteq U_0 = X \setminus \{y\}$, so $y \notin \overline{U}$. [step 1.3, L2]

3.1 Under step 2.3: $X \setminus \overline{U}$ is open by [L3] and contains $y$, so [L2] applied to it gives an open $V$ with $y \in V \subseteq \overline{V} \subseteq X \setminus \overline{U}$. [step 2.3, L2, L3]

4.1 Under step 3.1: $\overline{U} \cap \overline{V} = \varnothing$, since $\overline{V} \subseteq X \setminus \overline{U}$; so $U$ and $V$ witness the Urysohn condition at the pair $x, y$ and $X$ is Urysohn, which is claim 3. [step 3.1, A1]

5.1 Claims 1, 2 and 3 are steps 2.1, 2.2 and 4.1, and composing them gives the chain $T_3 \Rightarrow T_{2\frac12} \Rightarrow T_2 \Rightarrow T_1 \Rightarrow T_0$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 4.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Claim 3 is where the $T_1$ hypothesis earns its place.** Regularity separates a point from a *closed* set, and the closed set used in the proof is the singleton $\{y\}$; without $T_1$ that singleton need not be closed and the argument has nothing to start from. The indiscrete topology on two points is regular and not Urysohn, which shows the hypothesis cannot simply be dropped.

- **Regularity is applied twice, and the second application is the whole point.** The first shrink puts $y$ outside $\overline{U}$; the second separates $y$ from the closed set $\overline{U}$, which is what upgrades disjointness of the sets to disjointness of their closures.

- **Claim 2 explains why the Hausdorff condition alone is often quoted as "points are closed".** By [[thm-t1-iff-singletons-are-closed]] the two are not the same condition; $T_1$ is strictly weaker, and the cofinite topology on an infinite set separates them.

## The dependencies it declares, quoted verbatim from disk

These are the only statements the item is entitled to use. If a step
needs more than the text below gives, that is the defect — quote the
dependency text and show exactly what it fails to supply.

### `def-urysohn-space` — definition — Urysohn ($T_{2\\frac{1}{2}}$) space: distinct points have neighbourhoods with disjoint closures

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]), with
closures as in [[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]. Then $X$ is an **Urysohn
space**, also written **$T_{2\frac{1}{2}}$**, when any two distinct points have
open neighbourhoods whose *closures* are disjoint: for all $x, y \in X$ with
$x \ne y$ there are $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$ with

$$x \in U, \qquad y \in V, \qquad \overline{U} \cap \overline{V} = \varnothing .$$

Equivalently, by [[def-neighbourhood-top]], distinct points have disjoint closed
neighbourhoods: if $U$ and $V$ are as displayed then $\overline{U}$ and
$\overline{V}$ are disjoint closed neighbourhoods of $x$ and $y$; conversely
disjoint closed neighbourhoods $K \ni x$ and $L \ni y$ contain open
$U \ni x$ and $V \ni y$ with $\overline{U} \subseteq K$ and
$\overline{V} \subseteq L$, since $K$ and $L$ are closed, so the closures are
disjoint.

The condition is vacuous for a space with at most one point, and nothing is
asserted about equal points.

**The condition strictly strengthens the Hausdorff condition** on its face:
$U \subseteq \overline{U}$ and $V \subseteq \overline{V}$, so disjointness of the
closures forces disjointness of $U$ and $V$ and hence the Hausdorff property
([[def-hausdorff-space]]). That implication is proved as the next item, together
with the implication that puts Urysohn spaces below the regular $T_1$ spaces.
This page does not exhibit a Hausdorff space that is not Urysohn, and it does not
assert that one exists: every witness reachable from the material developed here
would need machinery this page does not have, so the question whether the
implication reverses is left open here.

**A live naming collision, flagged here and settled in this page's
conventions.** Two different conditions travel under Urysohn's name:

- the one defined above, separation of points by *disjoint closed
  neighbourhoods*, which is what this library calls **Urysohn** and
  $T_{2\frac{1}{2}}$;
- separation of points by a *continuous real-valued function*, which is usually
  called **completely Hausdorff** and which this library does not define.

Some texts exchange the two names. Neither is **Urysohn's lemma**, a theorem
about normal spaces that is not proved on this page at all
([[rem-separation-axiom-conventions]]).

### `def-hausdorff-space` — definition — Hausdorff space: distinct points have disjoint open neighbourhoods; every metrizable space is Hausdorff and the indiscrete topology on two points is not

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ ([[def-topological-space]]) is
**Hausdorff** when any two distinct points are separated by disjoint open sets:
for all $x, y \in X$ with $x \ne y$ there are $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$ with

$$x \in U, \qquad y \in V, \qquad U \cap V = \varnothing .$$

Since an open set containing a point is an open neighbourhood of it
([[def-neighbourhood-top]]), the condition reads: distinct points have disjoint
open neighbourhoods. Nothing is asserted about points that are equal, and the
condition is vacuous for a space with at most one point, so every such space is
Hausdorff.

**Every metrizable space is Hausdorff.** This is not proved here, because it is
already discharged: [[def-metrizable-space]] records it among the two things
every metrizable space has, deriving it from
[[thm-metric-hausdorff-separation]], which separates $p \ne q$ in a metric space
by the disjoint open balls $B(p,r)$ and $B(q,r)$ with $r = d(p,q)/2 > 0$. In
particular $\mathbb{R}$ with its usual topology, every $\mathbb{R}^n$, and every
subspace of a metrizable space are Hausdorff.

**Not every space is Hausdorff.** The indiscrete topology
$\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{ind}} = \{\varnothing, X\}$ on a set $X = \{a,b\}$ with
$a \ne b$ ([[def-standard-topologies]]) is not: the only open set containing $a$
is $X$, the only one containing $b$ is $X$, and $X \cap X = X \ne \varnothing$.
This is the same two-point space that [[def-metrizable-space]] uses to exhibit a
topology induced by no metric, and the reason is the same one: failure of the
Hausdorff condition is an obstruction to metrizability.

**Being Hausdorff is a topological property** ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]).
If $h : X \to Z$ is a homeomorphism and $X$ is Hausdorff, then for $z \ne z'$ in
$Z$ the points $h^{-1}(z)$ and $h^{-1}(z')$ are distinct, so they have disjoint
open $U, V$; the images $h[U]$ and $h[V]$ are open, disjoint, and contain $z$ and
$z'$ respectively, a homeomorphism carrying the open sets of one space
bijectively onto those of the other. So no space homeomorphic to a Hausdorff
space fails the condition.

**Scope of this item.** Only the definition, the metrizable case and the
two-point failure are recorded here, because that is all this page uses. The
Hausdorff condition is one of a graded family of separation axioms; that family,
its ordering, and the questions of which of its members are hereditary or
preserved by products, are not available at this point in the reading order and
nothing here anticipates them. What this page does use is a single negative
result: a quotient of a Hausdorff space need not be Hausdorff, which is recorded
below as a false statement and witnessed on the companion page.

### `def-regular-and-t3-spaces` — definition — Regular spaces and $T_3$ spaces, with the source disagreement over whether regularity includes $T_1$ stated explicitly

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]).

- $X$ is **regular** when a point can be separated from a closed set not
  containing it: for every closed $C \subseteq X$ and every
  $x \in X \setminus C$ there are $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$ with
  $$x \in U, \qquad C \subseteq V, \qquad U \cap V = \varnothing .$$
- $X$ is **$T_3$** when it is regular **and** $T_1$ ([[def-t0-and-t1-spaces]]).

Since an open set containing a point is an open neighbourhood of it
([[def-neighbourhood-top]]), regularity reads: $x$ and $C$ have disjoint open
neighbourhoods. The case $C = \varnothing$ is allowed and is satisfied by
$U = X$, $V = \varnothing$, so no nonemptiness is hidden in the condition.

**The convention fork, and this library's side of it.** Textbooks disagree about
whether the word *regular* carries a $T_1$ hypothesis. Munkres builds it in,
defining a regular space to be one in which points are closed and the separation
condition above holds; Kelley, Willard and Engelking do not, and reserve $T_3$
for the conjunction. **This library takes the second side**: *regular* names the
separation condition alone, $T_3$ names regular plus $T_1$, and every statement
that needs points to be closed writes the $T_1$ hypothesis out. The reason is
that the two halves are genuinely independent and each is used alone below: the
indiscrete topology on a two-point set is regular and not $T_0$
([[def-standard-topologies]]), and the cofinite topology on an infinite set is
$T_1$ and not regular, both witnessed on the companion page.

**Regularity alone implies no other separation axiom.** It does not imply $T_0$,
$T_1$ or Hausdorff ([[def-hausdorff-space]]): in the indiscrete topology on a set
$X$ the only closed sets are $\varnothing$ and $X$, so the only pair $(C, x)$ to
be separated has $C = \varnothing$, and $U = X$, $V = \varnothing$ separates it;
yet no two distinct points are distinguished by any open set. Conversely $T_1$
does not imply regularity. It is the *conjunction* $T_3$ that sits above
Hausdorff in the hierarchy, and the proof of that is two items below.

### `lem-regularity-via-closed-neighbourhoods` — lemma — A space is regular if and only if every point has a neighbourhood base of closed neighbourhoods, if and only if $x \\in U$ open gives an open $V$ with $x \\in V \\subseteq \\overline{V} \\subseteq U$

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]), with
closures as in [[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]] and neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-top]], so that a neighbourhood need not be open. The
following three conditions are equivalent.

- **(a)** $X$ is regular ([[def-regular-and-t3-spaces]]).
- **(b)** For every $x \in X$ and every open $U$ with $x \in U$ there is an open
  $V$ with
  $$x \in V \subseteq \overline{V} \subseteq U .$$
- **(c)** Every point of $X$ has a neighbourhood base consisting of **closed**
  neighbourhoods: for every $x \in X$ and every neighbourhood $N$ of $x$ there is
  a closed neighbourhood $K$ of $x$ with $K \subseteq N$.

### `def-t0-and-t1-spaces` — definition — $T_0$ (Kolmogorov) and $T_1$ (Frechet) spaces

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]).

- $X$ is **$T_0$**, or a **Kolmogorov space**, when any two distinct points are
  *topologically distinguishable*: for all $x, y \in X$ with $x \ne y$ there is
  an open set containing exactly one of $x$ and $y$.
- $X$ is **$T_1$**, or a **Frechet space**, when each of any two distinct points
  has an open set containing it and missing the other: for all $x, y \in X$ with
  $x \ne y$ there are $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$ with

$$x \in U, \quad y \notin U, \qquad y \in V, \quad x \notin V .$$

Nothing is asserted about a pair of equal points, so a space with at most one
point satisfies both conditions vacuously.

Since an open set containing a point is an open neighbourhood of it
([[def-neighbourhood-top]]), both conditions may be read with "open
neighbourhood" in place of "open set"; and by the same equivalence recorded in
[[def-neighbourhood-top]] they may be read with arbitrary neighbourhoods, since
a neighbourhood of $x$ contains an open one and an open neighbourhood is a
neighbourhood.

**Every $T_1$ space is $T_0$, and this is discharged here** rather than left to
the reader, because it is the bottom arrow of the whole hierarchy on this page.
Let $x \ne y$ and take $U, V$ as in the $T_1$ condition. Then $U$ is an open set
containing $x$ and not $y$, so it contains exactly one of the two points, which
is the $T_0$ condition. Only the first half of the $T_1$ condition is used, so
the implication does not reverse formally, and it does not reverse in fact:
Sierpinski space is a witness, recorded on the companion page.

**The two conditions differ exactly in symmetry.** $T_0$ asks for *one* open set
that tells the pair apart, with no control over which of the two it contains;
$T_1$ asks for *both* separations at once. In Sierpinski space
$(\{a,b\}, \{\varnothing, \{b\}, \{a,b\}\})$ of [[def-standard-topologies]] the
open set $\{b\}$ contains $b$ and not $a$, so the space is $T_0$; but the only
open set containing $a$ is the whole space, which also contains $b$, so it is
not $T_1$.

**Neither condition is a property of a set alone.** Both are properties of the
pair $(X, \mathcal{T})$, and both are inherited upwards along the comparison
order of [[def-topological-space]]: if $\mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2$
and $(X,\mathcal{T}_1)$ is $T_0$, respectively $T_1$, then so is
$(X,\mathcal{T}_2)$, since the separating open sets of the coarser topology lie
in the finer one. In particular the discrete topology satisfies both, and the
indiscrete topology on a set with at least two points satisfies neither.

### `thm-t1-iff-singletons-are-closed` — theorem — A space is $T_1$ if and only if every singleton is closed, if and only if every finite subset is closed, if and only if its topology contains the cofinite topology

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Statement

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]) and let
$\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{cof}}$ be the cofinite topology on the set $X$
([[def-standard-topologies]]). The following four conditions are equivalent.

- **(a)** $X$ is $T_1$ ([[def-t0-and-t1-spaces]]).
- **(b)** $\{x\}$ is closed for every $x \in X$.
- **(c)** $F$ is closed for every finite $F \subseteq X$ ([[def-countable]]).
- **(d)** $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{cof}} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$, that is, the
  topology of $X$ is finer than the cofinite topology on the same set.

Condition (d) says that the cofinite topology is the **coarsest** $T_1$ topology
on any set: it is $T_1$ by the equivalence, and every $T_1$ topology on that set
contains it.

### `def-interior-closure-boundary-top` — definition — Interior, closure, boundary, exterior, derived set and isolated point in a topological space

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]), let
$A \subseteq X$ and let $x \in X$. Neighbourhoods are as in
[[def-neighbourhood-top]], so a neighbourhood need not be open.

- The **interior** of $A$ is
  $\operatorname{int}(A) := \bigcup \{\, U \in \mathcal{T} : U \subseteq A \,\}$.
- The **closure** of $A$ is
  $\overline{A} := \bigcap \{\, F \subseteq X : F \text{ closed and } A \subseteq F \,\}$.
- The **exterior** of $A$ is $\operatorname{ext}(A) := \operatorname{int}(X \setminus A)$.
- The **boundary** of $A$ is $\partial A := \overline{A} \setminus \operatorname{int}(A)$.
- $x$ is a **limit point** (accumulation point) of $A$ if every neighbourhood $N$
  of $x$ satisfies $N \cap (A \setminus \{x\}) \ne \varnothing$. The set of limit
  points of $A$ is the **derived set** $A'$.
- $x$ is an **isolated point of $A$** if $x \in A$ and some neighbourhood $N$ of
  $x$ satisfies $N \cap A = \{x\}$.

**Both operators are well posed, and the two names are justified rather than
asserted.** The interior is a union of open sets, hence open by (T2), it is
contained in $A$, and it contains every open $U \subseteq A$: so
$\operatorname{int}(A)$ is *the largest open subset of $A$*. The family being
intersected in the definition of $\overline{A}$ is nonempty, since $X$ is closed
and contains $A$, so the intersection is a set; it is closed by (C2) of
[[def-topological-space]], it contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed
$F \supseteq A$: so $\overline{A}$ is *the smallest closed superset of $A$*. In
particular

$$\operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq A \subseteq \overline{A},$$

and $A$ is open if and only if $A = \operatorname{int}(A)$, and closed if and
only if $A = \overline{A}$, in each case because one inclusion is automatic and
the other says exactly that $A$ belongs to the family in question.

**Interior and closure are exchanged by complementation.** For every
$A \subseteq X$,

$$X \setminus \operatorname{int}(A) = \overline{X \setminus A}, \qquad X \setminus \overline{A} = \operatorname{int}(X \setminus A) = \operatorname{ext}(A).$$

Indeed $U \mapsto X \setminus U$ is a bijection between the open subsets of $A$
and the closed supersets of $X \setminus A$, and it turns unions into
intersections ([[def-topological-space]]); applying complementation to the first
identity gives the second. So $\operatorname{ext}(A) = X \setminus \overline{A}$,
and every statement about interiors has a mirror statement about closures.

**The pointwise description of the interior.** $x \in \operatorname{int}(A)$ if
and only if $A$ is a neighbourhood of $x$. If $x \in \operatorname{int}(A)$ then
$\operatorname{int}(A)$ is an open set with $x \in \operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq A$;
conversely a neighbourhood relation $x \in U \subseteq A$ with $U$ open puts $x$
in the union defining $\operatorname{int}(A)$. The corresponding description of
the closure is proved as the next item, because it is the statement that does the
work in every later proof.

**$X$ is the disjoint union of the three regions.** Since
$\operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq \overline{A}$, the three sets
$\operatorname{int}(A)$, $\partial A = \overline{A} \setminus \operatorname{int}(A)$
and $\operatorname{ext}(A) = X \setminus \overline{A}$ are pairwise disjoint and
their union is $X$. This is recorded again, with the identities for interior and
closure of unions and intersections, in the lemma two items below.

### `def-topological-space` — definition — Topology on a set, open and closed sets, clopen sets, the closed-set axiomatisation, and the coarser/finer comparison

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $X$ be a set and write $\mathcal{P}(X)$ for its power set. A **topology** on
$X$ is a family $\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ such that

- **(T1)** $\varnothing \in \mathcal{T}$ and $X \in \mathcal{T}$;
- **(T2)** $\bigcup \mathcal{S} \in \mathcal{T}$ for every $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$;
- **(T3)** $U \cap V \in \mathcal{T}$ for all $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$.

A **topological space** is a pair $(X, \mathcal{T})$ consisting of a set $X$ and
a topology $\mathcal{T}$ on it; the elements of $X$ are its **points**. When only
one topology is in play we write $X$ for the pair; when several are, the topology
is always named.

The members of $\mathcal{T}$ are the **open** sets of $(X,\mathcal{T})$. A subset
$F \subseteq X$ is **closed** when its complement $X \setminus F$ is open, and
**clopen** when it is both open and closed. By (T1) both $\varnothing$ and $X$
are clopen. *Open and closed are not opposites*: a set may be neither, and it may
be both, so "not open" is never a synonym for "closed".

**Finite intersections, and the empty one.** Axiom (T3) is stated for two sets
because that is all that is ever needed: if $n \ge 1$ and
$U_1, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{T}$, then $U_1 \cap \dots \cap U_n \in \mathcal{T}$
follows by iterating (T3) $n-1$ times. The intersection of the **empty** family
of subsets of $X$ is $X$, since the condition "lies in every member of the empty
family" is vacuous; that case is covered by (T1) rather than by (T3), which is
one of the two reasons $X \in \mathcal{T}$ is demanded outright. The other is
that (T2) alone gives only $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$.

**The closed sets, and the dual axiomatisation.** Put
$\mathcal{C} := \{\, X \setminus U : U \in \mathcal{T} \,\}$, the family of closed
sets. Then

- **(C1)** $\varnothing \in \mathcal{C}$ and $X \in \mathcal{C}$;
- **(C2)** $\bigcap \mathcal{D} \in \mathcal{C}$ for every **nonempty**
  $\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$;
- **(C3)** $C \cup D \in \mathcal{C}$ for all $C, D \in \mathcal{C}$.

Conversely, if a family $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ satisfies (C1),
(C2) and (C3), then $\mathcal{T} := \{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{C} \,\}$
is a topology on $X$ whose closed sets are exactly the members of $\mathcal{C}$.
So a topology may be presented equally well by its open sets or by its closed
sets, and this library uses whichever is shorter.

*Both directions are one computation, and it is carried out here rather than
assumed.* The map $U \mapsto X \setminus U$ is an involution of
$\mathcal{P}(X)$, hence a bijection, and it carries the two De Morgan identities

$$X \setminus \bigcup_{i \in I} A_i = \bigcap_{i \in I} (X \setminus A_i) \quad (I \ne \varnothing), \qquad X \setminus \bigcap_{i \in I} A_i = \bigcup_{i \in I} (X \setminus A_i) \quad (I \ne \varnothing)$$

term by term into each other. Given (T1)–(T3): $\varnothing = X \setminus X$ and
$X = X \setminus \varnothing$ lie in $\mathcal{C}$, which is (C1); for nonempty
$\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$ the family
$\mathcal{S} = \{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{D} \,\}$ lies in $\mathcal{T}$
and $\bigcap \mathcal{D} = X \setminus \bigcup \mathcal{S}$ is closed by (T2),
which is (C2); and $C \cup D = X \setminus ((X \setminus C) \cap (X \setminus D))$
is closed by (T3), which is (C3). Given (C1)–(C3) the same three lines run
backwards, the empty-union case $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$ being supplied
by (C1) rather than by (C2); and $\{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{C} \,\}$ has
$\mathcal{C}$ as its family of complements because complementation is an
involution.

**Comparison of topologies.** If $\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ are
topologies on the same set $X$ and $\mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2$, then
$\mathcal{T}_1$ is **coarser** than $\mathcal{T}_2$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ is
**finer** than $\mathcal{T}_1$; the comparison is **strict** when the inclusion
is. Inclusion is a partial order on the set of topologies on $X$
([[def-partial-order]]), and it is not a total one: two topologies on the same
set may be incomparable.

## What to return

Read `lem-urysohn-sits-between-hausdorff-and-regular-plus-t1` adversarially against the dependency text above and return
your findings in the block format the brief specifies, ending with the
`N fatal, M nonfatal` line.
