## Statement

Let $(X,d)$ be a **locally compact** metric space
([[def-locally-compact-metric-space]]) carrying its metric topology, let
$(Y,\mathcal{T}_Y)$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]), and give
$C(X,Y)$ the compact-open topology ([[def-compact-open-topology]]). Then the
evaluation map

$$e : C(X,Y) \times X \to Y, \qquad e(f,x) = f(x)$$

([[def-evaluation-map]]) is continuous, the product carrying the product topology
([[def-product-topology]]).

**No hypothesis whatever is placed on $Y$**, which is an arbitrary topological
space: the argument uses only that a point of $Y$ lies in an open set. No choice
principle is used.

**Local compactness is not removable.** This page records as a false statement
that the evaluation map is continuous for every metric domain, and its witness is
$X = \mathbb{Q}$, a metric space that is locally compact at no point.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A locally compact metric space $(X,d)$ with its metric topology, a topological space $(Y,\mathcal{T}_Y)$, the set $C(X,Y)$ with the compact-open topology, and the evaluation map $e$.

[L1] A map $h$ into $Y$ is continuous exactly when for every point $p$ of its domain and every open $V \subseteq Y$ with $h(p) \in V$ there is an open $U$ of the domain with $p \in U$ and $h[U] \subseteq V$ ([[def-continuous-map-top]], [[thm-continuity-characterisations-top]]).

[L2] For a two-element index set the basic product-open sets are the boxes: $O \times U$ with $O$ open in $C(X,Y)$ and $U$ open in $X$ is open in $C(X,Y) \times X$ ([[def-product-topology]], [[thm-basis-criterion]], [[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]).

[L3] $S(K,V) = \{\, g \in C(X,Y) : g[K] \subseteq V \,\}$ is open in the compact-open topology for every compact $K \subseteq X$ and open $V \subseteq Y$ ([[def-compact-open-topology]]).

[L4] Local compactness at $x$ gives a real $r_0 > 0$ such that $\bar B(x,r)$ is compact for every real $r$ with $0 < r < r_0$ ([[lem-compact-closed-balls-in-a-locally-compact-metric-space]], [[def-locally-compact-metric-space]], [[def-metric-compactness]]).

[L5] A subset $W \subseteq X$ is open exactly when each of its points has a ball around it inside $W$; balls are open; $B(x,r) \subseteq \bar B(x,r)$; and $\bar B(x,r) \subseteq B(x,s)$ whenever $0 < r < s$ ([[def-metric-topology]], [[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]], [[def-metric-ball]], [[def-metrizable-space]]).

[L6] The minimum of a two-element set of reals exists, is one of the two elements and is at most each of them ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

[L7] $f \in C(X,Y)$ is continuous, so $f^{-1}[V]$ is open in $X$ for every open $V \subseteq Y$ ([[def-continuous-map-top]], [[thm-continuity-characterisations-top]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $(f,x) \in C(X,Y) \times X$ and let $V \subseteq Y$ be open with $e(f,x) = f(x) \in V$. [L1]

1.2 Local compactness gives a real $r_0 > 0$ such that $\bar B(x,r)$ is compact for every real $r$ with $0 < r < r_0$. [L4, choose]

2.1 $f^{-1}[V]$ is open in $X$ and contains $x$, so there is a real $s > 0$ with $B(x,s) \subseteq f^{-1}[V]$. [step 1.1, L5, L7, choose]

3.1 Put $r := \min\{s, r_0\}/2$, a real with $0 < r$, $r < r_0$ and $r < s$; then $K := \bar B(x,r)$ is compact and $K \subseteq B(x,s) \subseteq f^{-1}[V]$, that is $f[K] \subseteq V$. [step 2.1, step 1.2, L5, L6]

4.1 Hence $f \in S(K,V)$, which is open in the compact-open topology, and $x \in B(x,r)$, which is open in $X$; so $S(K,V) \times B(x,r)$ is an open subset of the product containing $(f,x)$. [step 3.1, L2, L3, L5]

5.1 For every $(g,y) \in S(K,V) \times B(x,r)$: $y \in B(x,r) \subseteq \bar B(x,r) = K$ and $g[K] \subseteq V$, so $e(g,y) = g(y) \in V$; that is, $e[S(K,V) \times B(x,r)] \subseteq V$. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L3, L5]

6.1 Steps 4.1 and 5.1 exhibit, for the arbitrary point $(f,x)$ and the arbitrary open $V$ containing its image, an open set of the product around $(f,x)$ mapped into $V$; so $e$ is continuous. [step 1.1, step 4.1, step 5.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the compact-open topology is doing.** The whole proof is the single observation that $S(K,V)$ constrains a function on the *whole* of the compact set $K$, so once $K$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ the constraint survives moving the point as well as moving the function. A topology whose basic sets constrain a function at finitely many points only, such as the topology of pointwise convergence, cannot do this, and the evaluation map is in general not continuous for it.

- **Where local compactness is spent.** Once, at step 1.2, to produce a *compact* neighbourhood of $x$ inside the open set $f^{-1}[V]$. Every metric space has arbitrarily small closed balls inside such an open set; what local compactness adds is that they may be taken compact.

- **The converse is not asserted.** Nothing here says that continuity of the evaluation map forces $X$ to be locally compact. That direction is true for Hausdorff spaces in the general theory and is not proved in this library.

## The dependencies it declares, quoted verbatim from disk

Each block below is the claim-bearing text of one declared dependency.
These are the only statements the item is entitled to use. If a step
needs more than the text below gives, that is the defect — quote the
dependency text and show exactly what it fails to supply.

### `def-evaluation-map` — definition — The evaluation map $e : C(X,Y) \\times X \\to Y$, $e(f,x) = f(x)$

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space carrying its metric topology
([[def-metric-topology]], [[def-metrizable-space]]), let $(Y,\mathcal{T}_Y)$ be a
topological space ([[def-topological-space]]), and let $C(X,Y)$ carry the
compact-open topology ([[def-compact-open-topology]]). The **evaluation map** is

$$e : C(X,Y) \times X \longrightarrow Y, \qquad e(f,x) := f(x),$$

the domain carrying the product topology ([[def-product-topology]]) of the
compact-open topology on $C(X,Y)$ and the metric topology on $X$.

**This is a function.** For $f \in C(X,Y)$ and $x \in X$ the value $f(x)$ is a
well-determined element of $Y$, and a pair $(f,x)$ of the product determines both
entries ([[def-product-topology]]), so $e$ is defined on all of
$C(X,Y) \times X$ with no further condition.

**Which topology is meant is part of the definition.** Continuity of $e$ is a
statement about the pair of topologies on the source and the topology on the
target ([[def-continuous-map-top]]), and $C(X,Y)$ carries several topologies on
this page. Unless another is named, the topology on $C(X,Y)$ inside an evaluation
map is the compact-open one; where a subspace of $C(X,Y)$ is evaluated, it carries
the subspace topology ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]).

**Separate continuity is immediate; joint continuity is not.** For fixed
$f \in C(X,Y)$ the map $x \mapsto e(f,x) = f(x)$ is continuous, being $f$ itself.
For fixed $x \in X$ the map $f \mapsto e(f,x) = f(x)$ is continuous as well, since
for open $V \subseteq Y$ its preimage is $S(\{x\},V)$, a subbasic open set of the
compact-open topology, $\{x\}$ being compact ([[def-compact-open-topology]]).
What is at issue on this page is **joint** continuity, that is continuity of $e$
on the product, and that genuinely needs a hypothesis on $X$: it holds when $X$ is
locally compact, and this page records as a false statement that it holds for
every metric $X$, with an explicit witness.

### `def-compact-open-topology` — definition — The compact-open topology on $C(X,Y)$ for a metric domain $X$, with subbasis $S(K,V) = \\{f : f[K] \\subseteq V\\}$

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]) carrying its metric topology
([[def-metric-topology]], [[def-metrizable-space]]), let $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be
a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]), and let

$$C(X,Y) \;=\; \{\, f : X \to Y \;:\; f \text{ is continuous} \,\}$$

([[def-continuous-map-top]]). For a compact subset $K \subseteq X$
([[def-metric-compactness]]) and an open $V \in \mathcal{T}_Y$ put

$$S(K,V) \;:=\; \{\, f \in C(X,Y) \;:\; f[K] \subseteq V \,\} \;=\; \{\, f \in C(X,Y) : f(x) \in V \text{ for every } x \in K \,\} .$$

The **compact-open topology** on $C(X,Y)$ is the topology generated by

$$\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{co}} \;:=\; \{\, S(K,V) \;:\; K \subseteq X \text{ compact},\ V \in \mathcal{T}_Y \,\}$$

as a subbasis ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]). By [[thm-basis-criterion]] the
finite intersections

$$S(K_0,V_0) \cap \dots \cap S(K_{n-1},V_{n-1}) \qquad (n \in \mathbb{N})$$

form a basis for it, the value $n = 0$ giving the empty intersection $C(X,Y)$.
Nothing has to be checked for this to be a topology: a topology generated by an
arbitrary family exists and is the coarsest one containing it
([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]).

**Two degenerate members, recorded because they are used.** $S(\varnothing, V) = C(X,Y)$
for every open $V$, the empty set being compact and $f[\varnothing] = \varnothing$;
and $S(K, Y) = C(X,Y)$ for every compact $K$. Both are the whole space, so neither
constrains anything, and arguments below dispose of them separately rather than
dividing by a distance that does not exist.

**The domain is metric, and the target is not.** Compactness of $K$ is
[[def-metric-compactness]], which is defined for subsets of a metric space and,
at this point in the reading order, for nothing else; that is why $X$ carries a
metric here. The target $Y$ needs only its open sets, so it is an arbitrary
topological space throughout this definition and wherever the compact-open
topology alone is in play. Where a distance in the target is used — the uniform
metric, compact convergence, the comparison theorem — $Y$ is required to be
metric and the requirement is stated.

**Compactness of $K$ is intrinsic** ([[def-metric-compactness]]): it means that
the metric subspace $(K, d_K)$ is a compact metric space. The equivalent
description by families of open subsets of $X$ covering $K$ is
[[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]], and it is cited at every step that uses it.

**Notation.** The letter $S$ carries two unrelated meanings in this library:
$S(x,r)$ is the sphere of centre $x$ and radius $r$ in a metric space
([[def-metric-ball]]), and $S(K,V)$ is the set defined above. The two are never
ambiguous, because the first argument of a sphere is a point and its second a
positive real, while the first argument of $S(K,V)$ is a compact set and its
second an open set; no item on this page writes a sphere.

### `def-locally-compact-metric-space` — definition — Locally compact metric space: every point has a compact neighbourhood

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]), with balls as in
[[def-metric-ball]] and compact subsets as in [[def-metric-compactness]].

$(X,d)$ is **locally compact** if for every $x \in X$ there are a compact subset
$K \subseteq X$ and a real $r > 0$ with

$$B(x,r) \;\subseteq\; K .$$

**This is the condition "every point has a compact neighbourhood", written out.**
Give $X$ its metric topology $\mathcal{T}_d$ ([[def-metric-topology]]), so that
$(X, \mathcal{T}_d)$ is a topological space ([[def-metrizable-space]]). A set
$K \subseteq X$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ in the sense of
[[def-neighbourhood-top]] exactly when some open $U$ satisfies
$x \in U \subseteq K$, and by [[def-metric-topology]] that holds exactly when some
ball $B(x,r)$ satisfies $B(x,r) \subseteq K$. So the displayed condition says
precisely that $x$ has a compact neighbourhood, and the two readings are the same
condition and not two notions.

**Two conventions are fixed here, because both are live in the literature.**

- *Neighbourhoods need not be open.* This library's convention is
  [[def-neighbourhood-top]]'s, and it is what makes "compact neighbourhood" a
  useful phrase at all: a compact set is rarely open. Note that
  [[def-metric-topology]] uses the word *neighbourhood* for an open set
  containing the point; that narrower usage is confined to that item, and the
  present definition never relies on it.
- *Compactness of a subset is intrinsic.* $K$ compact means the metric subspace
  $(K, d_K)$ is a compact metric space ([[def-metric-compactness]],
  [[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]); the equivalent description by families
  of open subsets of the ambient $X$ is [[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]] and is
  cited wherever it is used.

**Every compact metric space is locally compact**, since $K := X$ and any $r > 0$
serve at every point. The empty metric space is locally compact, the condition
being vacuous.

### `lem-compact-closed-balls-in-a-locally-compact-metric-space` — lemma — In a locally compact metric space every point has arbitrarily small compact closed balls, hence a neighbourhood base of compact sets

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $(X,d)$ be a locally compact metric space
([[def-locally-compact-metric-space]]) and let $x \in X$. Then there is a real
$r_0 > 0$ such that

1. $\bar B(x,r)$ is a compact subset of $X$ ([[def-metric-ball]],
   [[def-metric-compactness]]) for **every** real $r$ with $0 < r < r_0$; and
2. the family $\{\, \bar B(x,r) : 0 < r < r_0 \,\}$ is a neighbourhood base at
   $x$ ([[def-neighbourhood-top]]) consisting of compact sets: every
   neighbourhood of $x$ contains one of these closed balls.

Note that the closed ball itself is compact, not merely its closure; a closed
ball is already closed ([[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]]). No choice principle is
used.

### `def-product-topology` — definition — The product set $\\prod_{i \\in I} X_i$ of functions choosing a point in each factor, the projections, the box topology, and the product topology as the initial topology of the projections; the empty product is a one-point space

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

**The product set.** Let $I$ be a set and let $X_i$ be a set for each $i \in I$.
The **product** is

$$\prod_{i \in I} X_i \;:=\; \Big\{\, x : x \text{ is a function with domain } I \text{ and } x(i) \in X_i \text{ for every } i \in I \,\Big\},$$

and we write $x_i := x(i)$, the $i$-th **coordinate** of $x$. Two elements of the
product are equal exactly when they agree at every index, functions being equal
when they have the same domain and the same values. For $j \in I$ the $j$-th
**projection** is

$$\pi_j : \prod_{i \in I} X_i \to X_j, \qquad \pi_j(x) := x_j .$$

**Notation for a finite product.** For $I = n$ a natural number, which is the set
$\{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ of its predecessors, an element of $\prod_{k<n} X_k$ is a
function on $n$ and we write it $(x_0, \dots, x_{n-1})$. In particular $I = 2$
gives the **binary product**, written $X \times Y$ for $\prod_{i<2} X_i$ with
$X_0 = X$ and $X_1 = Y$, whose elements are written $(u,v)$ for the function
$0 \mapsto u$, $1 \mapsto v$. This is the only meaning the symbol $X \times Y$
carries on this page.

**Two facts about when the product is nonempty, stated because they are used and
because they cost something.** If some $X_{i_0}$ is empty then the product is
empty, since no function can take a value in $X_{i_0}$. Conversely, suppose every
$X_i$ is nonempty.

- For $I = n$ a natural number, the product is nonempty, and this is a theorem of
  ZF: [[lem-finite-choice]] applied to the function $i \mapsto X_i$ on $n$
  supplies a choice function $g$ for the family of values, and
  $x(i) := g(X_i)$ defines a member of $\prod_{k<n} X_k$.
- For an arbitrary $I$ the assertion "$\prod_{i \in I} X_i \ne \varnothing$
  whenever every $X_i$ is nonempty" **is** the Axiom of Choice: it is the
  formulation recorded in [[def-axiom-of-choice]], and the choice function of
  [[def-choice-function]] is exactly a point of the product of a family by
  itself. Every use of it below is flagged at the step that spends it.

**The box topology.** Now let each $X_i$ carry a topology $\mathcal{T}_i$
([[def-topological-space]]). Put

$$\mathcal{R} \;:=\; \Big\{\, \prod_{i \in I} U_i \;:\; U_i \in \mathcal{T}_i \text{ for every } i \in I \,\Big\},$$

the family of **boxes**. $\mathcal{R}$ is a basis for a topology
([[thm-basis-criterion]]): it contains $\prod_i X_i$, so it covers the product,
and it is closed under binary intersections, since

$$\Big(\prod_i U_i\Big) \cap \Big(\prod_i V_i\Big) = \prod_i (U_i \cap V_i)$$

and each $U_i \cap V_i$ is open by (T3). The topology it generates is the **box
topology** $\mathcal{T}^{\square}$, and $\mathcal{R}$ is a basis for it
([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]).

**The product topology.** The **product topology** $\mathcal{T}^{\Pi}$ on
$\prod_i X_i$ is the initial topology of the family of projections
$(\pi_i)_{i \in I}$ ([[def-initial-and-final-topology]]): the topology generated
by the subbasis

$$\mathcal{G} \;:=\; \{\, \pi_i^{-1}[U] : i \in I,\ U \in \mathcal{T}_i \,\}, \qquad \pi_i^{-1}[U] = \prod_{j \in I} W_j \ \text{ with } W_i = U \text{ and } W_j = X_j \text{ for } j \ne i .$$

By [[thm-basis-criterion]] the finite intersections of members of $\mathcal{G}$
form a basis for $\mathcal{T}^{\Pi}$, and those finite intersections are exactly
the boxes with all but finitely many factors unrestricted:

$$\mathcal{R}^{\Pi} \;=\; \Big\{\, \prod_{i \in I} U_i \;:\; U_i \in \mathcal{T}_i \text{ for every } i, \text{ and } U_i = X_i \text{ for all but finitely many } i \,\Big\}.$$

Indeed the intersection of $\pi_{i_1}^{-1}[U_1], \dots, \pi_{i_n}^{-1}[U_n]$ is
the box whose factor at $i$ is the intersection of those $U_m$ with $i_m = i$ and
is $X_i$ when no $i_m$ equals $i$; and the intersection of no members is the
whole product, the box with every factor $X_i$. Conversely a box with
$U_i = X_i$ off a finite set is such an intersection. Members of
$\mathcal{R}^{\Pi}$ are called **basic product-open** sets, and members of
$\mathcal{R}$ **boxes**. So $\mathcal{R}^{\Pi} \subseteq \mathcal{R}$, with
equality when $I$ is a natural number.

**The empty product.** For $I = \varnothing$ there is exactly one function with
domain $\varnothing$, the empty function, so $\prod_{i \in \varnothing} X_i$ is a
one-point set. A one-point set carries exactly one topology, namely
$\{\varnothing, \{\varnothing\}\}$, since a topology must contain the empty set
and the whole set and there is nothing else to contain
([[def-topological-space]]); so the box topology and the product topology agree
there, and both equal the discrete topology and the indiscrete topology
([[def-standard-topologies]]), which coincide on a one-point set. There are no
projections to speak of, and the initial topology of the empty family is indeed
the indiscrete one ([[def-initial-and-final-topology]]).

**Convention.** Unless the box topology is named explicitly, $\prod_i X_i$ always
carries the product topology in this library. That is not a matter of taste: the
product topology is the one with the characteristic property of the next item,
and the box topology has no such property.

### `def-continuous-map-top` — definition — Continuity of a map of topological spaces at a point and globally

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be topological spaces
([[def-topological-space]]), let $f : X \to Y$ be a function and let $x \in X$.
Neighbourhoods are as in [[def-neighbourhood-top]].

$f$ is **continuous at $x$** if for every neighbourhood $V$ of $f(x)$ in $Y$ the
preimage $f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ in $X$.

$f$ is **continuous** if it is continuous at every point of $X$.

**The same condition with open sets only.** $f$ is continuous at $x$ if and only
if for every open $V \subseteq Y$ with $f(x) \in V$ there is an open
$U \subseteq X$ with $x \in U$ and $f[U] \subseteq V$. Indeed, if $f$ is
continuous at $x$ and $V$ is such an open set, then $V$ is a neighbourhood of
$f(x)$, so $f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ and contains an open $U \ni x$,
which satisfies $f[U] \subseteq V$. Conversely, given the displayed condition and
a neighbourhood $V$ of $f(x)$, fix open $V_0$ with $f(x) \in V_0 \subseteq V$ and
then open $U \ni x$ with $f[U] \subseteq V_0$; then $x \in U \subseteq f^{-1}[V_0] \subseteq f^{-1}[V]$,
so $f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$. Both forms are used below and are the
same statement written twice.

**Preimage, not image.** $f^{-1}[V] = \{\, x \in X : f(x) \in V \,\}$
is the preimage in the sense of [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]] and is
defined for every function, invertible or not; no inverse function is being
asserted to exist. Continuity is a condition on preimages throughout, and the
corresponding conditions on images define the *open* and *closed* maps of a later
item, which are different notions.

### `thm-continuity-characterisations-top` — theorem — For a map of spaces the following agree: continuity at every point, preimages of open sets open, preimages of closed sets closed, preimages of subbasic open sets open, and $f(\\overline{A}) \\subseteq \\overline{f(A)}$

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be topological spaces, let
$f : X \to Y$ be a function, and let $\mathcal{S}$ be a subbasis for
$\mathcal{T}_Y$ ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]). The following five conditions
are equivalent.

- **(a)** $f$ is continuous at every point of $X$ ([[def-continuous-map-top]]).
- **(b)** $f^{-1}[V]$ is open in $X$ for every open $V \subseteq Y$.
- **(c)** $f^{-1}[F]$ is closed in $X$ for every closed $F \subseteq Y$.
- **(d)** $f^{-1}[S]$ is open in $X$ for every $S \in \mathcal{S}$.
- **(e)** $f[\overline{A}] \subseteq \overline{f[A]}$ for every $A \subseteq X$,
  closures being taken in $X$ and in $Y$ respectively
  ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

Condition (d) is what makes continuity checkable against a generating family
rather than against every open set, and it holds for a *basis* as well, a basis
being in particular a subbasis for the topology it generates.

### `def-metric-ball` — definition — Open ball, closed ball and sphere in a metric space

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]), let $x \in X$ and let
$r \in \mathbb{R}$ with $r > 0$ ([[def-real-order]]). Define

$$B(x,r) := \{\, y \in X : d(x,y) < r \,\}, \qquad \bar B(x,r) := \{\, y \in X : d(x,y) \le r \,\}, \qquad S(x,r) := \{\, y \in X : d(x,y) = r \,\}.$$

$B(x,r)$ is the **open ball**, $\bar B(x,r)$ the **closed ball** and $S(x,r)$ the
**sphere** of **centre** $x$ and **radius** $r$. The radius is always a strictly
positive real; a ball of radius $0$ or of negative radius is never written in
this library.

**Immediate consequences of the definitions.** For every $x \in X$ and $r > 0$:

- $x \in B(x,r)$, because $d(x,x) = 0 < r$ (axiom (M1) of [[def-metric-space]]);
  in particular open and closed balls are nonempty.
- $B(x,r) \subseteq \bar B(x,r)$ and $S(x,r) \subseteq \bar B(x,r)$, and
  $\bar B(x,r)$ is the disjoint union of $B(x,r)$ and $S(x,r)$, by trichotomy of
  the order of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]):
  each $y$ satisfies exactly one of $d(x,y) < r$, $d(x,y) = r$, $d(x,y) > r$.
- If $0 < s \le r$ then $B(x,s) \subseteq B(x,r)$ and
  $\bar B(x,s) \subseteq \bar B(x,r)$, by transitivity of the order.
- Nonnegativity of the metric ([[lem-metric-nonnegativity]]) is what forces the
  radius convention, and it forces it for the **open** ball only: if $r \le 0$
  then $B(x,r) = \{y : d(x,y) < r\}$ is empty, because $d(x,y) \ge 0 \ge r$
  for every $y$. The other two sets behave differently at $r = 0$, and the
  convention $r > 0$ excludes them for uniformity rather than for emptiness:
  $\bar B(x,0) = S(x,0) = \{x\}$, since $d(x,y) \le 0$ together with
  $d(x,y) \ge 0$ gives $d(x,y) = 0$ and hence $y = x$ by (M1). For $r < 0$ all
  three sets are empty.

**A sphere may be empty, and so the three sets are not on a par.** For $r > 0$
the open and closed balls always contain $x$, but nothing in the definition
produces a point at distance exactly $r$ from $x$. If a metric takes only the
values $0$ and $1$, as the discrete metric on the companion page does, then
$S(x,2) = \emptyset$ while $B(x,2) = \bar B(x,2)$ is the whole space. So
nonemptiness of a sphere is never available by convention: where it is used, it
is proved.

**The ambient space is part of the notation.** $B(x,r)$ depends on $(X,d)$ and
not on $x$ and $r$ alone. When more than one space or more than one metric is in
play we write $B_X(x,r)$, or $B_d(x,r)$, and likewise for $\bar B$ and $S$. This
matters as soon as subspaces appear ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]): a
ball of a subspace is the trace on it of a ball of the ambient space, and the two
are different sets.

### `def-metric-topology` — definition — The metric topology: a set is open when every one of its points has a ball around it inside the set; closed means open complement

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]).

A subset $U \subseteq X$ is **open in $(X,d)$** if for every $x \in U$ there is a
real $r > 0$ with $B(x,r) \subseteq U$ ([[def-metric-ball]]). A subset
$F \subseteq X$ is **closed in $(X,d)$** if its complement $X \setminus F$ is
open.

The collection

$$\mathcal{T}_d := \{\, U \subseteq X : U \text{ is open in } (X,d) \,\}$$

of all open subsets is the **metric topology** of $d$ on $X$. A subset of $X$
that is both open and closed is called **clopen**.

**Two sets are open for trivial reasons.** $\emptyset$ is open, because the
defining condition quantifies over no points; and $X$ is open, because
$B(x,r) \subseteq X$ for every $x$ and every $r > 0$. Consequently $X$ and
$\emptyset$ are also closed, and both are clopen.

**A neighbourhood of a point $x$** is any open set containing $x$. The condition
above therefore reads: $U$ is open exactly when every point of $U$ has a ball
around it inside $U$, and it is the balls alone that have to be tested.

**The metric, not the set, determines $\mathcal{T}_d$.** Two metrics on the same
set may have different metric topologies, and two different metrics may have the
same one; the systematic comparison is [[def-equivalent-metrics]].

### `thm-metric-open-set-algebra` — theorem — Arbitrary unions and finite intersections of open sets are open, open balls are open and closed balls are closed

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]), with open and closed sets
as in [[def-metric-topology]] and balls as in [[def-metric-ball]]. Then:

1. **Balls are open.** $B(x,r)$ is open, for every $x \in X$ and every $r > 0$.
2. **Arbitrary unions.** If $\mathcal{U}$ is any collection of open subsets of
   $X$, then $\bigcup \mathcal{U}$ is open.
3. **Finite intersections.** If $n \ge 1$ and $U_0, \dots, U_{n-1}$ are open,
   then $U_0 \cap \dots \cap U_{n-1}$ is open.
4. **Closed balls are closed.** $\bar B(x,r)$ is closed, for every $x \in X$ and
   every $r > 0$.

Together with the fact that $\emptyset$ and $X$ are open, recorded already in
[[def-metric-topology]], claims 2 and 3 say that $\mathcal{T}_d$ has exactly the
closure properties that the word *topology* names.

### `def-metric-compactness` — definition — Open cover, subcover, compact metric space, and compact subset of a metric space

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]), with open sets as in
[[def-metric-topology]] and balls as in [[def-metric-ball]].

- An **open cover** of $(X,d)$ is a family $\mathcal{U}$ of open subsets of $X$
  with $X = \bigcup \mathcal{U}$, where
  $\bigcup \mathcal{U} = \{\, x \in X : x \in U \text{ for some } U \in \mathcal{U} \,\}$.
- A **subcover** of $\mathcal{U}$ is a subfamily
  $\mathcal{V} \subseteq \mathcal{U}$ that is itself an open cover.
- A family $\mathcal{V}$ of sets is **finite** when $\mathcal{V} = \emptyset$ or
  there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and sets $V_0, \dots, V_n$ with
  $\mathcal{V} = \{V_0, \dots, V_n\}$; repetitions in the list are allowed and
  harmless.
- $(X,d)$ is **compact** when every open cover of it has a finite subcover: for
  every open cover $\mathcal{U}$, either $X = \emptyset$ and the empty subfamily
  covers it, or there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
  $U_0, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{U}$ with
  $$X = U_0 \cup \dots \cup U_n .$$
- A subset $A \subseteq X$ is a **compact subset** of $X$ when the metric
  subspace $(A, d_A)$ is a compact metric space, $d_A$ being the restriction of
  $d$ to $A \times A$ ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]).

**Compactness of a subset is defined intrinsically, and only intrinsically.**
The last clause speaks about the subspace $(A,d_A)$ and its own open sets, not
about families of open subsets of the ambient $X$. The two readings do agree,
but that is a theorem and not a convention: it is
[[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]], and no item of this library may use the
ambient reading without citing it. Taking the intrinsic reading as the
definition is what makes "compact" a property of the metric space $(A,d_A)$
alone, so that a set compact in one ambient space is compact in every other one
containing it isometrically.

**The empty space is compact**, since the empty subfamily of any family covers
it; this is the reason the clause above is written with the two cases. The
one-point space is compact too, and so is every space listed as
$\{x_0, \dots, x_n\}$: given a cover, each $x_i$ lies in some member, and
finitely many members chosen in this way already cover.

**The finiteness convention, and how it is used both ways.** "Finite" above is
the listing form, matching the finite lists of
[[def-finite-intersection-property]]. It agrees with the definition of
finiteness by equinumerosity with a natural number ([[def-countable]]), and
both directions of the agreement are available and are used below:

- A nonempty finite set $F$ in the sense of [[def-countable]] satisfies
  $F \approx m$ for some $m \ge 1$, and a bijection $m \to F$ is exactly a
  listing $F = \{a_0, \dots, a_{m-1}\}$.
- Conversely a set listed as $A = \{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$, that is the image of a
  function $a$ with domain $\sigma(n)$, is finite in the sense of
  [[def-countable]]: the map sending $x \in A$ to the least $i \le n$ with
  $a_i = x$ is an injection of $A$ into $\sigma(n)$, so $A$ is equinumerous with
  a subset of $\mathbb{N}$ bounded above, and such a subset is finite
  ([[lem-subset-of-countable]]).

Neither direction uses a choice principle: the second selects nothing, taking a
least index instead.

### `def-topology-basis-subbasis` — definition — Basis and subbasis for a topology, and the topology generated by a family of sets

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]).

A family $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$ is a **basis for $\mathcal{T}$** if
every open set is a union of members of $\mathcal{B}$: for every
$U \in \mathcal{T}$ there is $\mathcal{B}_U \subseteq \mathcal{B}$ with
$U = \bigcup \mathcal{B}_U$. Equivalently, and this is the form used in proofs,

$$\text{for every } U \in \mathcal{T} \text{ and every } x \in U \text{ there is } B \in \mathcal{B} \text{ with } x \in B \subseteq U .$$

*The two forms say the same thing.* If every open $U$ is such a union and
$x \in U$, then $x$ lies in one of the sets united, which is a member of
$\mathcal{B}$ inside $U$. Conversely, if the displayed condition holds then
$U = \bigcup \{\, B \in \mathcal{B} : B \subseteq U \,\}$, since each such $B$ is
contained in $U$ and each $x \in U$ lies in one of them. Note that
$\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$, so the empty open set is covered by the empty
subfamily and needs no member of $\mathcal{B}$. The members of a basis are called
**basic open sets**.

**The topology generated by a family.** Let $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$
be *any* family of subsets of $X$. Then

$$\langle \mathcal{S} \rangle := \bigcap \{\, \mathcal{T}' : \mathcal{T}' \text{ is a topology on } X \text{ with } \mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{T}' \,\}$$

is a topology on $X$, it contains $\mathcal{S}$, and it is contained in every
topology on $X$ that contains $\mathcal{S}$. It is called the **topology
generated by $\mathcal{S}$**, and $\mathcal{S}$ is a **subbasis** for a topology
$\mathcal{T}$ when $\mathcal{T} = \langle \mathcal{S} \rangle$.

*This is well posed, and the obligation is discharged here.* The collection being
intersected is nonempty, because $\mathcal{P}(X)$ is a topology on $X$ containing
$\mathcal{S}$; so the intersection is an intersection of a nonempty family of
subsets of $\mathcal{P}(X)$ and is a set. It is a topology: $\varnothing$ and $X$
lie in every topology on $X$, hence in the intersection, which is (T1); if
$\mathcal{S}' \subseteq \langle \mathcal{S} \rangle$ then $\mathcal{S}'$ is a
subfamily of each $\mathcal{T}'$ in the collection, so $\bigcup \mathcal{S}'$ lies
in each $\mathcal{T}'$ and hence in the intersection, which is (T2); and the same
argument with $U \cap V$ gives (T3). It contains $\mathcal{S}$ because every
$\mathcal{T}'$ in the collection does, and it is contained in each such
$\mathcal{T}'$ because an intersection is contained in each of its members. So
$\langle \mathcal{S} \rangle$ is the coarsest topology on $X$ containing
$\mathcal{S}$ ([[def-topological-space]]), and in particular it is uniquely
determined by $\mathcal{S}$.

**Neither notion is intrinsic to the family alone.** "$\mathcal{B}$ is a basis
for $\mathcal{T}$" and "$\mathcal{S}$ is a subbasis for $\mathcal{T}$" are
relations between a family and a topology, not properties of the family. The
question of which families are a basis *for some* topology, and how the topology
generated by a subbasis is computed from it, is settled by the next item.

### `thm-basis-criterion` — theorem — A family is a basis for a unique topology iff it covers the set and every point of an intersection of two members lies in a member inside that intersection; finite intersections of any subbasis form a basis

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $X$ be a set, and for $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ write

$$\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{B}} := \{\, U \subseteq X : \text{for every } x \in U \text{ there is } B \in \mathcal{B} \text{ with } x \in B \subseteq U \,\} .$$

1. $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for some topology on $X$ ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]])
   if and only if

   - **(B1)** $\bigcup \mathcal{B} = X$, and
   - **(B2)** for all $B_1, B_2 \in \mathcal{B}$ and every $x \in B_1 \cap B_2$
     there is $B_3 \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B_3 \subseteq B_1 \cap B_2$.

   When (B1) and (B2) hold, that topology is **unique**: it is
   $\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{B}}$, which is also exactly the family of all unions of
   subfamilies of $\mathcal{B}$.

2. Let $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ be an arbitrary family and let
   $\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S}}$ be the family of intersections of finitely many
   members of $\mathcal{S}$. Then $\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S}}$ satisfies (B1) and
   (B2), and $\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S}}} = \langle \mathcal{S} \rangle$,
   the topology generated by $\mathcal{S}$. So the finite intersections of any
   subbasis form a basis for the topology it generates.

**The nullary intersection: this library takes the empty intersection to be $X$.**
In claim 2 the phrase "finitely many" includes **none**, and the intersection of
the empty subfamily of $\mathcal{S}$ is $X$, because the defining condition "lies
in every member of the empty family" holds of every point of $X$. Hence
$X \in \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S}}$ for every $\mathcal{S}$, including
$\mathcal{S} = \varnothing$, and **no covering hypothesis is imposed on a
subbasis**. The competing convention takes only nonempty finite intersections and
compensates by requiring $\bigcup \mathcal{S} = X$; under it claim 2 holds
verbatim once that hypothesis is added, and the two conventions differ only in
which of the two devices supplies (B1). The choice made here is recorded again
among this page's conventions, and it is the reason
$\langle \varnothing \rangle$ comes out as the indiscrete topology
$\{\varnothing, X\}$ rather than being undefined.

### `def-metrizable-space` — definition — Metrizable space: a topological space whose topology is induced by some metric; metrizability is topological, the metric is not

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ ([[def-topological-space]]) is
**metrizable** if there is a metric $d$ on $X$ ([[def-metric-space]]) whose
metric topology is $\mathcal{T}$, that is $\mathcal{T} = \mathcal{T}_d$
([[def-metric-topology]]). Such a $d$ is said to **induce** or **metrise**
$\mathcal{T}$.

**The definition presupposes that $\mathcal{T}_d$ is a topology in the sense of
[[def-topological-space]], and it is.** By [[def-metric-topology]] both
$\varnothing$ and $X$ are open in $(X,d)$, which is (T1), and by
[[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]] the family $\mathcal{T}_d$ is closed under
arbitrary unions, which is (T2), and under intersections of $n \ge 1$ members,
which contains (T3). So every metric space is a topological space, and the
metric-space development of this library is a special case of the present one.

**The standard local notions in the two developments agree after translating
their neighbourhood conventions.** Let $d$ be a metric on $X$ and give $X$ the
topology $\mathcal{T}_d$.

- *Neighbourhoods and balls.* [[def-metric-topology]] uses "neighbourhood" for
  an open set containing $x$, whereas [[def-neighbourhood-top]] also allows a
  non-open superset of such a set. Thus the two collections are not literally
  equal, but the open metric neighbourhoods are cofinal in the broader
  neighbourhood filter. The balls $B(x,r)$, $r > 0$ ([[def-metric-ball]]), are
  open ([[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]]) and form a neighbourhood base at $x$:
  any neighbourhood $N$ contains an open $U \ni x$, hence a ball around $x$ by
  [[def-metric-topology]]. The balls of radius $1/n$ alone already suffice
  ([[lem-metric-ball-neighbourhood-base]]).
- *Interior, closure, boundary.* [[def-metric-interior-closure-boundary]] defines
  them by the same conditions with balls in place of neighbourhoods, and the
  previous bullet makes the two conditions equivalent; the metric closure is the
  smallest closed superset ([[thm-metric-closure-characterisation]]), which is the
  definition used here ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]). So the two
  closures, the two interiors and the two boundaries are the same three
  operations.
- *Convergence.* $x_k \to p$ in the sense of [[def-sequence-convergence-top]] is
  "eventually in every neighbourhood of $p$", and by the first bullet this is
  "eventually in every ball around $p$", which is [[def-metric-convergence]].
- *Continuity.* $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ continuity at $a$
  ([[def-metric-continuity]]) says that every ball around $f(a)$ has a ball
  around $a$ mapped into it, which by the first bullet is continuity at $a$ in
  the sense of [[def-continuous-map-top]].

- *Subspaces.* For $A \subseteq X$ the subspace topology
  $\{\, U \cap A : U \in \mathcal{T}_d \,\}$ of [[def-subspace-topology-top]] is
  exactly the metric topology of the subspace metric $d_A$
  ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]), so the two uses of the phrase
  *subspace topology* in this library name one thing. Indeed
  $B_A(a,r) = B_X(a,r) \cap A$: a trace $U \cap A$ is $d_A$-open, since each of
  its points $a$ has $B_X(a,r) \subseteq U$ and hence $B_A(a,r) \subseteq U \cap A$;
  and a $d_A$-open $W$ is the trace of
  $U := \bigcup \{\, B_X(a,r) : a \in W,\ r > 0,\ B_X(a,r) \cap A \subseteq W \,\}$,
  which is $d_X$-open, satisfies $U \cap A = W$, and involves no choice principle,
  the union being taken over a set of pairs rather than over a selection.

Consequently the metric-space notions of interior, closure, boundary, density,
convergence, continuity and subspace agree with the topological notions here,
and statements about them transfer once a metric is named. For neighbourhoods
the transfer uses the explicit convention change above: a metric-page
neighbourhood is an open topological neighbourhood, while every topological
neighbourhood contains one.

**Metrizability is a topological property; the metric is not part of it.** If
$h : X \to Y$ is a homeomorphism ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]) and $d$
metrises $X$, then $d'(y_1,y_2) := d(h^{-1}(y_1), h^{-1}(y_2))$ is a metric on
$Y$ — the three axioms transfer along the bijection $h^{-1}$ — and
$h[B_d(x,r)] = B_{d'}(h(x), r)$, so $h$ carries a basis of $\mathcal{T}_d$ to a
basis of $\mathcal{T}_{d'}$ and $\mathcal{T}_{d'} = h[\mathcal{T}_d] = \mathcal{T}_Y$.
Hence $Y$ is metrizable. The metric itself, however, is **not** determined by the
topology: two metrics on one set may induce the same topology without agreeing,
which is exactly topological equivalence ([[def-equivalent-metrics]]), and
properties of a metric that are not properties of its topology, boundedness among
them, are therefore not properties of a metrizable space.

**Two things every metrizable space has.** It is **Hausdorff**: distinct points
have disjoint open neighbourhoods, by [[thm-metric-hausdorff-separation]] applied
to any metric inducing the topology. And it is **first countable**
([[def-first-countable-top]]), by [[lem-metric-ball-neighbourhood-base]]. Either
failure is therefore an obstruction to metrizability, and this page uses the
first of them to exhibit a topology induced by no metric.

**Sequential limits in a metrizable space are unique, so the notation
$\lim_k x_k$ is available there.** In a metric space a sequence has at most one
limit ([[lem-metric-limits-unique]]), and by the agreement of convergence above
that uniqueness is a statement about the topology alone; so within a metrizable
space, and only there, this page writes $\lim_k x_k$ in the ordinary way. In a
general space the symbol is unavailable ([[def-sequence-convergence-top]]).

**The usual topology of $\mathbb{R}$.** The absolute value makes $\mathbb{R}$ a
metric space under $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) = |x-y|$, its open balls are the bounded
open intervals, and the resulting metric topology is what claim 3 of
[[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]] names the **usual topology** of $\mathbb{R}$.
That is the topology meant by the phrase throughout these two pages, and
$\mathbb{R}$ carrying it is metrizable by definition. Every statement about it on
these two pages is proved from the metric $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ and the bridge above,
and no example re-derives any of it.

### `def-max-min` — definition — Maximum and minimum of a set

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $m \in \mathbb{R}$.

- $m$ is a **maximum** (or *greatest element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $s \le m$
  for every $s \in S$.
- $m$ is a **minimum** (or *least element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $m \le s$
  for every $s \in S$.

A set has at most one maximum: if $m_1$ and $m_2$ are both maxima then
$m_1 \in S$ gives $m_1 \le m_2$ and $m_2 \in S$ gives $m_2 \le m_1$, so
$m_1 = m_2$ by antisymmetry of the order, which is immediate from the trichotomy
axiom of an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).
The same argument applies to minima, so we may write $\max S$ and $\min S$.

### `lem-finite-set-has-max` — lemma — Every nonempty finite set of reals has a maximum and a minimum

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and all $a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n \in \mathbb{R}$, the
set $\{a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ has a maximum and a minimum ([[def-max-min]]).

What is proved below is exactly the displayed statement, by induction on $n$.

The usual reading, that *every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has a
maximum and a minimum*, follows once one identifies the nonempty finite subsets
of $\mathbb{R}$ with the sets listable as $\{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$. That
identification is recorded as a stipulation in the Given below, because this page
has no definition of finiteness to prove it against. **It is discharged, not
merely assumed**: [[lem-finite-subsets-listable]] proves that the two
descriptions of a nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ agree. That lemma is
recorded in `justified_by` rather than in `deps`, since it is about the sets this
lemma quantifies over and therefore depends on this one. This is what licenses
the notation
$\max\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ and $\min\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ for finite sets of
**real** numbers from this page onwards.

### `def-topological-space` — definition — Topology on a set, open and closed sets, clopen sets, the closed-set axiomatisation, and the coarser/finer comparison

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $X$ be a set and write $\mathcal{P}(X)$ for its power set. A **topology** on
$X$ is a family $\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ such that

- **(T1)** $\varnothing \in \mathcal{T}$ and $X \in \mathcal{T}$;
- **(T2)** $\bigcup \mathcal{S} \in \mathcal{T}$ for every $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$;
- **(T3)** $U \cap V \in \mathcal{T}$ for all $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$.

A **topological space** is a pair $(X, \mathcal{T})$ consisting of a set $X$ and
a topology $\mathcal{T}$ on it; the elements of $X$ are its **points**. When only
one topology is in play we write $X$ for the pair; when several are, the topology
is always named.

The members of $\mathcal{T}$ are the **open** sets of $(X,\mathcal{T})$. A subset
$F \subseteq X$ is **closed** when its complement $X \setminus F$ is open, and
**clopen** when it is both open and closed. By (T1) both $\varnothing$ and $X$
are clopen. *Open and closed are not opposites*: a set may be neither, and it may
be both, so "not open" is never a synonym for "closed".

**Finite intersections, and the empty one.** Axiom (T3) is stated for two sets
because that is all that is ever needed: if $n \ge 1$ and
$U_1, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{T}$, then $U_1 \cap \dots \cap U_n \in \mathcal{T}$
follows by iterating (T3) $n-1$ times. The intersection of the **empty** family
of subsets of $X$ is $X$, since the condition "lies in every member of the empty
family" is vacuous; that case is covered by (T1) rather than by (T3), which is
one of the two reasons $X \in \mathcal{T}$ is demanded outright. The other is
that (T2) alone gives only $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$.

**The closed sets, and the dual axiomatisation.** Put
$\mathcal{C} := \{\, X \setminus U : U \in \mathcal{T} \,\}$, the family of closed
sets. Then

- **(C1)** $\varnothing \in \mathcal{C}$ and $X \in \mathcal{C}$;
- **(C2)** $\bigcap \mathcal{D} \in \mathcal{C}$ for every **nonempty**
  $\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$;
- **(C3)** $C \cup D \in \mathcal{C}$ for all $C, D \in \mathcal{C}$.

Conversely, if a family $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ satisfies (C1),
(C2) and (C3), then $\mathcal{T} := \{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{C} \,\}$
is a topology on $X$ whose closed sets are exactly the members of $\mathcal{C}$.
So a topology may be presented equally well by its open sets or by its closed
sets, and this library uses whichever is shorter.

*Both directions are one computation, and it is carried out here rather than
assumed.* The map $U \mapsto X \setminus U$ is an involution of
$\mathcal{P}(X)$, hence a bijection, and it carries the two De Morgan identities

$$X \setminus \bigcup_{i \in I} A_i = \bigcap_{i \in I} (X \setminus A_i) \quad (I \ne \varnothing), \qquad X \setminus \bigcap_{i \in I} A_i = \bigcup_{i \in I} (X \setminus A_i) \quad (I \ne \varnothing)$$

term by term into each other. Given (T1)–(T3): $\varnothing = X \setminus X$ and
$X = X \setminus \varnothing$ lie in $\mathcal{C}$, which is (C1); for nonempty
$\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$ the family
$\mathcal{S} = \{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{D} \,\}$ lies in $\mathcal{T}$
and $\bigcap \mathcal{D} = X \setminus \bigcup \mathcal{S}$ is closed by (T2),
which is (C2); and $C \cup D = X \setminus ((X \setminus C) \cap (X \setminus D))$
is closed by (T3), which is (C3). Given (C1)–(C3) the same three lines run
backwards, the empty-union case $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$ being supplied
by (C1) rather than by (C2); and $\{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{C} \,\}$ has
$\mathcal{C}$ as its family of complements because complementation is an
involution.

**Comparison of topologies.** If $\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ are
topologies on the same set $X$ and $\mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2$, then
$\mathcal{T}_1$ is **coarser** than $\mathcal{T}_2$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ is
**finer** than $\mathcal{T}_1$; the comparison is **strict** when the inclusion
is. Inclusion is a partial order on the set of topologies on $X$
([[def-partial-order]]), and it is not a total one: two topologies on the same
set may be incomparable.

### Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) constructed in this
library ([[def-real-numbers]]) and carrying its order ([[def-real-order]]).

Let $X$ be a set. A **metric** on $X$ is a function
$d : X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $x, y, z \in X$:

- **(M1) Separation.** $d(x,y) = 0$ if and only if $x = y$.
- **(M2) Symmetry.** $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$.
- **(M3) Triangle inequality.** $d(x,z) \le d(x,y) + d(y,z)$.

A **metric space** is a pair $(X,d)$ consisting of a set $X$ and a metric $d$ on
it. The elements of $X$ are its **points** and $d(x,y)$ is the **distance** from
$x$ to $y$. When only one metric is in play we write $X$ for $(X,d)$; when
several are, the metric is always named.

**The values of a metric are real numbers.** The codomain is $\mathbb{R}$, so
$d(x,y)$ is an honest element of the complete ordered field and every
inequality above is an inequality there. No infinite value is permitted;
[[rem-metric-axiom-conventions]] records why extended metrics are not treated in
this library.

**Nonnegativity is deliberately absent from the axiom list.** Many texts add a
fourth axiom $d(x,y) \ge 0$. It is redundant: (M1), (M2) and (M3) already force
it, as [[lem-metric-nonnegativity]] proves. Nothing below assumes it before that
lemma is available.

**Pseudometric.** A **pseudometric** on $X$ is a function
$p : X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying (M2), (M3) and the weakening

- **(M1') Reflexivity.** $p(x,x) = 0$ for every $x \in X$

of (M1). A pseudometric may therefore assign distance $0$ to two distinct
points. Every metric is a pseudometric, and a pseudometric is a metric exactly
when $p(x,y) = 0$ forces $x = y$.

**Ultrametric.** An **ultrametric** on $X$ is a metric $d$ that in addition
satisfies

- **(M3') Strong triangle inequality.** $d(x,z) \le \max\{d(x,y), d(y,z)\}$

for all $x, y, z \in X$, where the maximum is that of a two-element subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, which exists and is one of the two elements
([[def-max-min]], [[lem-finite-set-has-max]]). An **ultrametric space** is a pair
$(X,d)$ with $d$ an ultrametric.
