## Statement

For $A\subseteq X$ and $p\in X$, one has $p\in\overline A$ if and only if there is a net in $A$ converging to $p$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ and a point $p\in X$.

[L1] $p\in\overline A$ exactly when every neighbourhood of $p$ meets $A$ ([[thm-closure-characterisation-top]]).

[L2] Finite intersections of neighbourhoods of $p$ are neighbourhoods of $p$ ([[def-neighbourhood-top]]).

[L3] A net converges exactly when it is eventually in every neighbourhood ([[def-net-convergence-and-cluster-point]]).



## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 Suppose $p\in\overline A$. Let $E=\{(N,a):N\in\mathcal N(p),\ a\in N\cap A\}$, ordered by $(N,a)\preceq(M,b)$ when $M\subseteq N$, and put $x_{(N,a)}=a$. [L1, construct]

1.2 Conversely, if a net $x$ in $A$ converges to $p$, every neighbourhood $N$ of $p$ contains some eventual value $x_d\in A$, so $N\cap A\ne\varnothing$ and $p\in\overline A$. [L1, L3]

2.1 The index set is directed: for $(N,a),(M,b)$, the set $N\cap M$ is a neighbourhood and meets $A$; for $c\in(N\cap M)\cap A$, the pair $(N\cap M,c)$ is above both. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.2 Given a neighbourhood $N$ of $p$, choose $(N,a)\in E$. Every later pair has its second coordinate in a subset of $N$, so $x$ is eventually in $N$ and therefore converges to $p$. [step 1.1, L3]

3.1 Steps 1.1--2.1 construct the required net and step 1.2 proves the converse. [step 2.2, step 1.2, discharge-construct] ∎

## The dependencies it declares, quoted verbatim from disk

Each block below is the claim-bearing text of one declared dependency.
These are the only statements the item is entitled to use. If a step
needs more than the text below gives, that is the defect — quote the
dependency text and show exactly what it fails to supply.

### `def-net-convergence-and-cluster-point` — definition — Convergence and cluster points of a net in a topological space

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Let $x:D\to X$ be a net in a topological space $X$ and let $p\in X$.

- $x$ **converges to $p$**, written $x_d\to p$, if it is eventually in every neighbourhood of $p$ ([[def-neighbourhood-top]]).
- $p$ is a **cluster point** of $x$ if $x$ is frequently in every neighbourhood of $p$.

Convergence implies being a cluster point. If $x$ is eventually in a neighbourhood
$N$ after $d_0$, then for an arbitrary threshold $d$ choose a common upper bound
$e\ge d,d_0$; one has $x_e\in N$, so $x$ is frequently in $N$.

### `thm-closure-characterisation-top` — theorem — A point lies in the closure of $A$ iff every basic neighbourhood of it meets $A$; the closure is the smallest closed superset and equals $A$ together with its derived set

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, let $\mathcal{B}$ be a basis for
$\mathcal{T}$ ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]), let $A \subseteq X$ and let
$x \in X$. Closure, derived set and limit points are as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]. Then:

1. The following four conditions are equivalent.
   - (a) $x \in \overline{A}$;
   - (b) $N \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every neighbourhood $N$ of $x$
     ([[def-neighbourhood-top]]);
   - (c) $U \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every open $U$ with $x \in U$;
   - (d) $B \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every $B \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B$.
2. $\overline{A}$ is closed, contains $A$, and is contained in every closed
   $F \subseteq X$ with $A \subseteq F$; so it is the smallest closed superset of
   $A$, and $A$ is closed if and only if $A = \overline{A}$.
3. $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$.

Claim 2 is recorded here for reference and is discharged in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]], where it is what makes the definition of
$\overline{A}$ well posed; claims 1 and 3 are proved below. Claim 1 is the form in
which the closure is used everywhere afterwards, and clause (d) is what makes a
closure computable from a basis rather than from all open sets.

### `def-neighbourhood-top` — definition — Neighbourhood of a point and neighbourhood base, with this library's convention that a neighbourhood need not be open

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]) and let
$x \in X$.

A set $N \subseteq X$ is a **neighbourhood of $x$** if there is an open
$U \in \mathcal{T}$ with $x \in U \subseteq N$. The family of all neighbourhoods
of $x$ is written $\mathcal{N}(x)$ and called the **neighbourhood filter** at
$x$. A neighbourhood that is itself open is an **open neighbourhood**.

**Convention, and it is a live fork: in this library a neighbourhood need not be
open.** The competing convention, used by Munkres among others, defines a
neighbourhood of $x$ to be an *open* set containing $x$. Both are in current use;
this library follows the one above and writes "open neighbourhood" in full
whenever openness is wanted, so that no statement here depends on which
convention a reader brings.

A family $\mathcal{B}_x \subseteq \mathcal{N}(x)$ is a **neighbourhood base at
$x$** if every neighbourhood of $x$ contains a member of $\mathcal{B}_x$: for
every $N \in \mathcal{N}(x)$ there is $B \in \mathcal{B}_x$ with $B \subseteq N$.

**Four immediate consequences, established here because they are used
constantly.**

1. *$X$ is a neighbourhood of each of its points*, since $x \in X \subseteq X$
   and $X$ is open by (T1); so $\mathcal{N}(x) \ne \varnothing$ and every point
   has at least one neighbourhood base, namely $\mathcal{N}(x)$ itself.
2. *A superset of a neighbourhood of $x$ is a neighbourhood of $x$*: if
   $x \in U \subseteq N \subseteq M$ with $U$ open then $x \in U \subseteq M$.
3. *The intersection of two neighbourhoods of $x$ is a neighbourhood of $x$*: if
   $x \in U \subseteq N$ and $x \in V \subseteq M$ with $U, V$ open, then
   $U \cap V$ is open by (T3) and $x \in U \cap V \subseteq N \cap M$. By
   iteration the same holds for any intersection of finitely many
   neighbourhoods of $x$.
4. *A set is open exactly when it is a neighbourhood of each of its points.* If
   $U$ is open and $x \in U$ then $x \in U \subseteq U$. Conversely, if $N$ is a
   neighbourhood of each of its points, choose for each $x \in N$ an open $U_x$
   with $x \in U_x \subseteq N$; then $N = \bigcup_{x \in N} U_x$ is open by (T2).
   No choice principle is involved: $U_x$ may be taken to be the union of *all*
   open subsets of $N$ containing $x$, which is determined by $x$ and $N$, and is
   open by (T2).

**Basic sets give neighbourhood bases.** If $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for
$\mathcal{T}$ ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]) then
$\mathcal{B}_x := \{\, B \in \mathcal{B} : x \in B \,\}$ is a neighbourhood base
at $x$ consisting of open sets. Each such $B$ is open and contains $x$, hence is
a neighbourhood of $x$; and if $N \in \mathcal{N}(x)$, fix open $U$ with
$x \in U \subseteq N$ and then $B \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B \subseteq U$,
which gives $B \in \mathcal{B}_x$ with $B \subseteq N$. A member of
$\mathcal{B}_x$ is called a **basic neighbourhood** of $x$.
