## Statement

**False claim:** every $T_1$ space ([[def-t0-and-t1-spaces]]) is Hausdorff
([[def-hausdorff-space]]).

The refutation is the **cofinite topology** $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{cof}}$ on
$\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-standard-topologies]]), whose open sets are $\varnothing$
together with the complements of the finite subsets of $\mathbb{R}$. It is $T_1$,
because its closed sets are exactly $\mathbb{R}$ and the finite sets; and it is
not Hausdorff, because any two nonempty open sets meet, $\mathbb{R}$ being
infinite. The witness is worked further on the companion page, where the same
space is shown to fail regularity and normality as well.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The set $\mathbb{R}$ with the cofinite topology $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{cof}}$, and two points $x \ne y$ of $\mathbb{R}$.

[A1] A space is Hausdorff when any two distinct points have disjoint open neighbourhoods ([[def-hausdorff-space]], [[def-topological-space]]).

[L1] $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{cof}}$ consists of $\varnothing$ together with the sets whose complement is finite; a union of two finite sets is finite ([[def-standard-topologies]], facts (i) and (ii) of that item).

[L2] A topology is $T_1$ exactly when it contains the cofinite topology on the same set ([[thm-t1-iff-singletons-are-closed]], clause (d)).

[L3] $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable ([[thm-r-uncountable]]), and every finite set is at most countable ([[def-countable]]); so $\mathbb{R}$ is not finite.

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{cof}} \subseteq \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{cof}}$, so the cofinite topology on $\mathbb{R}$ is $T_1$. [L2]

1.2 $\mathbb{R}$ is not finite, since a finite set is at most countable and $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable. [L3]

1.3 Let $U, V \in \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{cof}}$ be nonempty and suppose $U \cap V = \varnothing$; then $\mathbb{R} = \mathbb{R} \setminus (U \cap V) = (\mathbb{R} \setminus U) \cup (\mathbb{R} \setminus V)$, a union of two finite sets, hence finite by [L1]. [L1, assume-hyp]

2.1 Step 1.3 contradicts step 1.2, so no two nonempty open sets of $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{cof}}$ are disjoint. [step 1.2, step 1.3]

3.1 Take $x \ne y$ in $\mathbb{R}$, for instance $x = 0$ and $y = 1$. Any open $U \ni x$ and open $V \ni y$ are nonempty, so $U \cap V \ne \varnothing$ by step 2.1, and $x$ and $y$ have no disjoint open neighbourhoods. [step 2.1]

4.1 By step 1.1 the space $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{cof}})$ is $T_1$, and by step 3.1 and [A1] it is not Hausdorff; so the claim is false. [step 1.1, step 3.1, A1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The failure is as large as it can be**, not a boundary case: in the cofinite topology on an infinite set *no* two nonempty open sets are disjoint, so the Hausdorff condition fails at every pair of distinct points at once.

- **What is true is the converse.** Every Hausdorff space is $T_1$ ([[lem-urysohn-sits-between-hausdorff-and-regular-plus-t1]]), so $T_1$ is strictly weaker, and this item is what makes "strictly" honest.

- **Any infinite set would do.** $\mathbb{R}$ is chosen because its infinitude is already a theorem here ([[thm-r-uncountable]]); nothing in the argument uses the order or the arithmetic of $\mathbb{R}$.

### `def-t0-and-t1-spaces` — definition — $T_0$ (Kolmogorov) and $T_1$ (Frechet) spaces

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]).

- $X$ is **$T_0$**, or a **Kolmogorov space**, when any two distinct points are
  *topologically distinguishable*: for all $x, y \in X$ with $x \ne y$ there is
  an open set containing exactly one of $x$ and $y$.
- $X$ is **$T_1$**, or a **Frechet space**, when each of any two distinct points
  has an open set containing it and missing the other: for all $x, y \in X$ with
  $x \ne y$ there are $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$ with

$$x \in U, \quad y \notin U, \qquad y \in V, \quad x \notin V .$$

Nothing is asserted about a pair of equal points, so a space with at most one
point satisfies both conditions vacuously.

Since an open set containing a point is an open neighbourhood of it
([[def-neighbourhood-top]]), both conditions may be read with "open
neighbourhood" in place of "open set"; and by the same equivalence recorded in
[[def-neighbourhood-top]] they may be read with arbitrary neighbourhoods, since
a neighbourhood of $x$ contains an open one and an open neighbourhood is a
neighbourhood.

**Every $T_1$ space is $T_0$, and this is discharged here** rather than left to
the reader, because it is the bottom arrow of the whole hierarchy on this page.
Let $x \ne y$ and take $U, V$ as in the $T_1$ condition. Then $U$ is an open set
containing $x$ and not $y$, so it contains exactly one of the two points, which
is the $T_0$ condition. Only the first half of the $T_1$ condition is used, so
the implication does not reverse formally, and it does not reverse in fact:
Sierpinski space is a witness, recorded on the companion page.

**The two conditions differ exactly in symmetry.** $T_0$ asks for *one* open set
that tells the pair apart, with no control over which of the two it contains;
$T_1$ asks for *both* separations at once. In Sierpinski space
$(\{a,b\}, \{\varnothing, \{b\}, \{a,b\}\})$ of [[def-standard-topologies]] the
open set $\{b\}$ contains $b$ and not $a$, so the space is $T_0$; but the only
open set containing $a$ is the whole space, which also contains $b$, so it is
not $T_1$.

**Neither condition is a property of a set alone.** Both are properties of the
pair $(X, \mathcal{T})$, and both are inherited upwards along the comparison
order of [[def-topological-space]]: if $\mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2$
and $(X,\mathcal{T}_1)$ is $T_0$, respectively $T_1$, then so is
$(X,\mathcal{T}_2)$, since the separating open sets of the coarser topology lie
in the finer one. In particular the discrete topology satisfies both, and the
indiscrete topology on a set with at least two points satisfies neither.

### `thm-t1-iff-singletons-are-closed` — theorem — A space is $T_1$ if and only if every singleton is closed, if and only if every finite subset is closed, if and only if its topology contains the cofinite topology

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Statement

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]) and let
$\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{cof}}$ be the cofinite topology on the set $X$
([[def-standard-topologies]]). The following four conditions are equivalent.

- **(a)** $X$ is $T_1$ ([[def-t0-and-t1-spaces]]).
- **(b)** $\{x\}$ is closed for every $x \in X$.
- **(c)** $F$ is closed for every finite $F \subseteq X$ ([[def-countable]]).
- **(d)** $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{cof}} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$, that is, the
  topology of $X$ is finer than the cofinite topology on the same set.

Condition (d) says that the cofinite topology is the **coarsest** $T_1$ topology
on any set: it is $T_1$ by the equivalence, and every $T_1$ topology on that set
contains it.

### `def-hausdorff-space` — definition — Hausdorff space: distinct points have disjoint open neighbourhoods; every metrizable space is Hausdorff and the indiscrete topology on two points is not

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ ([[def-topological-space]]) is
**Hausdorff** when any two distinct points are separated by disjoint open sets:
for all $x, y \in X$ with $x \ne y$ there are $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$ with

$$x \in U, \qquad y \in V, \qquad U \cap V = \varnothing .$$

Since an open set containing a point is an open neighbourhood of it
([[def-neighbourhood-top]]), the condition reads: distinct points have disjoint
open neighbourhoods. Nothing is asserted about points that are equal, and the
condition is vacuous for a space with at most one point, so every such space is
Hausdorff.

**Every metrizable space is Hausdorff.** This is not proved here, because it is
already discharged: [[def-metrizable-space]] records it among the two things
every metrizable space has, deriving it from
[[thm-metric-hausdorff-separation]], which separates $p \ne q$ in a metric space
by the disjoint open balls $B(p,r)$ and $B(q,r)$ with $r = d(p,q)/2 > 0$. In
particular $\mathbb{R}$ with its usual topology, every $\mathbb{R}^n$, and every
subspace of a metrizable space are Hausdorff.

**Not every space is Hausdorff.** The indiscrete topology
$\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{ind}} = \{\varnothing, X\}$ on a set $X = \{a,b\}$ with
$a \ne b$ ([[def-standard-topologies]]) is not: the only open set containing $a$
is $X$, the only one containing $b$ is $X$, and $X \cap X = X \ne \varnothing$.
This is the same two-point space that [[def-metrizable-space]] uses to exhibit a
topology induced by no metric, and the reason is the same one: failure of the
Hausdorff condition is an obstruction to metrizability.

**Being Hausdorff is a topological property** ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]).
If $h : X \to Z$ is a homeomorphism and $X$ is Hausdorff, then for $z \ne z'$ in
$Z$ the points $h^{-1}(z)$ and $h^{-1}(z')$ are distinct, so they have disjoint
open $U, V$; the images $h[U]$ and $h[V]$ are open, disjoint, and contain $z$ and
$z'$ respectively, a homeomorphism carrying the open sets of one space
bijectively onto those of the other. So no space homeomorphic to a Hausdorff
space fails the condition.

**Scope of this item.** Only the definition, the metrizable case and the
two-point failure are recorded here, because that is all this page uses. The
Hausdorff condition is one of a graded family of separation axioms; that family,
its ordering, and the questions of which of its members are hereditary or
preserved by products, are not available at this point in the reading order and
nothing here anticipates them. What this page does use is a single negative
result: a quotient of a Hausdorff space need not be Hausdorff, which is recorded
below as a false statement and witnessed on the companion page.

### `def-standard-topologies` — definition — The discrete, indiscrete, cofinite, cocountable, particular-point and Sierpinski topologies

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Throughout, a topology is as in [[def-topological-space]], and *finite*,
*at most countable* and *uncountable* are as in [[def-countable]], so that
"countable" always means "at most countable" and every finite set is countable.
Let $X$ be a set. The six families below are topologies on $X$; that each really
satisfies (T1), (T2) and (T3) is discharged in full after the list.

1. **Discrete topology.** $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{disc}} := \mathcal{P}(X)$: every
   subset is open, hence every subset is closed, hence every subset is clopen.
2. **Indiscrete topology.** $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{ind}} := \{\varnothing, X\}$.
   Its closed sets are again $\varnothing$ and $X$.
3. **Cofinite topology.**
   $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{cof}} := \{\varnothing\} \cup \{\, U \subseteq X : X \setminus U \text{ is finite} \,\}$.
   Its closed sets are $X$ together with the finite subsets of $X$.
4. **Cocountable topology.**
   $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{coc}} := \{\varnothing\} \cup \{\, U \subseteq X : X \setminus U \text{ is at most countable} \,\}$.
   Its closed sets are $X$ together with the at most countable subsets of $X$.
5. **Particular-point topology.** Fix $p \in X$ and put
   $\mathcal{T}_p := \{\varnothing\} \cup \{\, U \subseteq X : p \in U \,\}$: the
   open sets are $\varnothing$ and the sets containing $p$. Its closed sets are
   $X$ together with the sets **not** containing $p$.
6. **Sierpinski topology.** On a two-point set $S = \{a, b\}$ with $a \ne b$,
   $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{Sier}} := \{\varnothing, \{b\}, S\}$. The pair
   $(S, \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{Sier}})$ is **Sierpinski space**; $b$ is its open
   point and $a$ its closed point. This is exactly the particular-point topology
   of item 5 on a two-point set with particular point $b$, listed separately
   because it is quoted so often.

**Two elementary facts about finite sets are used below, and both are proved
here.**

*(i) A subset of a finite set is finite.* Let $F \approx n$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}$
([[def-equinumerous]], [[def-natural-numbers]]), witnessed by a bijection
$\varphi : F \to n$, and let $B \subseteq F$. Then $\varphi$ restricts to a
bijection of $B$ onto $\varphi[B] \subseteq n$
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]). Every element of the von Neumann natural
$n$ is a natural number strictly smaller than $n$
([[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]), so $\varphi[B]$ is a subset of $\mathbb{N}$
bounded above by $n$, hence finite by the sharper form of
[[lem-subset-of-countable]] ("a subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is finite if it is
bounded above"). Since $\approx$ is symmetric and transitive, $B$ is finite.

*(ii) A union of two finite sets is finite.* First, if $H$ is finite and $g$ is
any object then $H \cup \{g\}$ is finite: if $g \in H$ there is nothing to prove,
and otherwise a bijection $u : H \to k$ extends to a bijection
$H \cup \{g\} \to k \cup \{k\} = \sigma(k)$ by setting $u(g) := k$, which is
injective because $k \notin k$ ([[lem-nat-transitive-irreflexive]]). Now fix a
finite set $F$ and argue by induction ([[thm-induction-principle]]) on
$m \in \mathbb{N}$ over the statement "for every $G$ with $G \approx m$, the union
$F \cup G$ is finite". At $m = 0$ we have $G = \varnothing$ and $F \cup G = F$. At
$m = \sigma(j)$, a bijection $\psi : G \to \sigma(j)$ gives $g := \psi^{-1}(j)$
and $G' := G \setminus \{g\} \approx j$ (restrict $\psi$), so
$F \cup G = (F \cup G') \cup \{g\}$ is finite by the induction hypothesis and the
previous sentence.

**Discharge of the topology axioms.**

*Discrete.* Every subset of $X$ lies in $\mathcal{P}(X)$, so (T1), (T2) and (T3)
hold with nothing to check.

*Indiscrete.* (T1) is the definition. For (T2), a subfamily of
$\{\varnothing, X\}$ has union $\varnothing$ (if it is empty or $\{\varnothing\}$)
or $X$ (otherwise). For (T3), $\varnothing \cap A = \varnothing$ and
$X \cap X = X$.

*Cofinite.* (T1): $\varnothing$ is listed, and $X \setminus X = \varnothing$ is
finite. (T2): let $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{cof}}$. If every
member is $\varnothing$ the union is $\varnothing$. Otherwise fix
$U_0 \in \mathcal{S}$ with $U_0 \ne \varnothing$; then
$X \setminus \bigcup \mathcal{S} \subseteq X \setminus U_0$, which is finite, so
the left side is finite by (i). (T3): for nonempty $U, V$ with finite
complements, $X \setminus (U \cap V) = (X \setminus U) \cup (X \setminus V)$ is
finite by (ii); and if either of $U, V$ is empty so is $U \cap V$. The closed sets
are the complements of the open ones, that is $X = X \setminus \varnothing$
together with the finite sets.

*Cocountable.* Identical to the cofinite case with "at most countable" in place of
"finite": (i) is replaced by [[lem-subset-of-countable]] itself, and (ii) by the
statement that a union of two at most countable sets is at most countable, which
is the two-set instance of [[thm-countable-union-of-countable]] applied to the
family $A_0 := U, A_1 := V, A_k := \varnothing$ for $k \ge 2$.

*Particular point.* (T1): $\varnothing$ is listed and $p \in X$. (T2): a
subfamily whose members are all $\varnothing$ has union $\varnothing$; otherwise
some member contains $p$, hence so does the union. (T3): if $U$ and $V$ both
contain $p$ then so does $U \cap V$; and if either is $\varnothing$ then so is the
intersection.

*Sierpinski.* The special case $X = \{a,b\}$, $p = b$ of the previous paragraph:
the sets containing $b$ are $\{b\}$ and $S$, so
$\mathcal{T}_b = \{\varnothing, \{b\}, S\} = \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{Sier}}$.

### `def-countable` — definition — Finite, countably infinite, countable, uncountable

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Recall that a natural number is a von Neumann natural
([[def-natural-numbers]]): $0 = \varnothing$ and $\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$, so
that

$$n = \{\, m \in \mathbb{N} : m < n \,\} = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$$

is itself the set of its predecessors. Here $<$ is the order of
[[def-nat-order]], which is defined additively, so the displayed identity is a
theorem and not a convention: it is [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]], proved
immediately above. Let $A$ be a set, and let $\approx$ be equinumerosity
([[def-equinumerous]]).

- $A$ is **finite** if $A \approx n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
- $A$ is **countably infinite** if $A \approx \mathbb{N}$.
- $A$ is **at most countable** if it is finite or countably infinite.
- $A$ is **uncountable** if it is not at most countable.

### `thm-r-uncountable` — theorem — $\\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable (Cantor's nested intervals, 1874)

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $\mathbb{R}$ be a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).
Then $\mathbb{R}$ is **uncountable** ([[def-countable]]): there is no surjection
$\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, so $\mathbb{R}$ is neither finite nor countably
infinite.

The proof is Cantor's original argument of 1874, not the decimal diagonal.
Assuming a surjection $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, one builds nested closed
intervals $[a_n, b_n]$ with $a_n < b_n$ and $f(n) \notin [a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}]$, and
then $\sup\{a_n\}$ is a real number that $f$ misses. **The decimal diagonal is
deliberately avoided**: decimal expansions are infinite series, which this
library has not yet constructed, so a diagonal proof here would rest on machinery
that does not exist. The diagonal argument survives in its non-circular form, on
power sets, as Cantor's theorem earlier on this page; see the remarks below.

**The construction uses no choice, and that is what the thirds are for.** Given
$[a_n, b_n]$ of length $d$, its three closed thirds
$[a_n, a_n + d/3]$, $[a_n + d/3, a_n + 2d/3]$, $[a_n + 2d/3, b_n]$ cannot all
contain $f(n)$, because the first and the third are disjoint; the rule takes the
**first one in that fixed order** which does not contain $f(n)$. That is a
definition by cases, so the whole construction is a single application of the
recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) to one explicitly given function. A version
of the argument that says "pick a third avoiding $f(n)$" would be using dependent
choice, silently and unnecessarily.

### `def-topological-space` — definition — Topology on a set, open and closed sets, clopen sets, the closed-set axiomatisation, and the coarser/finer comparison

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $X$ be a set and write $\mathcal{P}(X)$ for its power set. A **topology** on
$X$ is a family $\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ such that

- **(T1)** $\varnothing \in \mathcal{T}$ and $X \in \mathcal{T}$;
- **(T2)** $\bigcup \mathcal{S} \in \mathcal{T}$ for every $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$;
- **(T3)** $U \cap V \in \mathcal{T}$ for all $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$.

A **topological space** is a pair $(X, \mathcal{T})$ consisting of a set $X$ and
a topology $\mathcal{T}$ on it; the elements of $X$ are its **points**. When only
one topology is in play we write $X$ for the pair; when several are, the topology
is always named.

The members of $\mathcal{T}$ are the **open** sets of $(X,\mathcal{T})$. A subset
$F \subseteq X$ is **closed** when its complement $X \setminus F$ is open, and
**clopen** when it is both open and closed. By (T1) both $\varnothing$ and $X$
are clopen. *Open and closed are not opposites*: a set may be neither, and it may
be both, so "not open" is never a synonym for "closed".

**Finite intersections, and the empty one.** Axiom (T3) is stated for two sets
because that is all that is ever needed: if $n \ge 1$ and
$U_1, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{T}$, then $U_1 \cap \dots \cap U_n \in \mathcal{T}$
follows by iterating (T3) $n-1$ times. The intersection of the **empty** family
of subsets of $X$ is $X$, since the condition "lies in every member of the empty
family" is vacuous; that case is covered by (T1) rather than by (T3), which is
one of the two reasons $X \in \mathcal{T}$ is demanded outright. The other is
that (T2) alone gives only $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$.

**The closed sets, and the dual axiomatisation.** Put
$\mathcal{C} := \{\, X \setminus U : U \in \mathcal{T} \,\}$, the family of closed
sets. Then

- **(C1)** $\varnothing \in \mathcal{C}$ and $X \in \mathcal{C}$;
- **(C2)** $\bigcap \mathcal{D} \in \mathcal{C}$ for every **nonempty**
  $\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$;
- **(C3)** $C \cup D \in \mathcal{C}$ for all $C, D \in \mathcal{C}$.

Conversely, if a family $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ satisfies (C1),
(C2) and (C3), then $\mathcal{T} := \{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{C} \,\}$
is a topology on $X$ whose closed sets are exactly the members of $\mathcal{C}$.
So a topology may be presented equally well by its open sets or by its closed
sets, and this library uses whichever is shorter.

*Both directions are one computation, and it is carried out here rather than
assumed.* The map $U \mapsto X \setminus U$ is an involution of
$\mathcal{P}(X)$, hence a bijection, and it carries the two De Morgan identities

$$X \setminus \bigcup_{i \in I} A_i = \bigcap_{i \in I} (X \setminus A_i) \quad (I \ne \varnothing), \qquad X \setminus \bigcap_{i \in I} A_i = \bigcup_{i \in I} (X \setminus A_i) \quad (I \ne \varnothing)$$

term by term into each other. Given (T1)–(T3): $\varnothing = X \setminus X$ and
$X = X \setminus \varnothing$ lie in $\mathcal{C}$, which is (C1); for nonempty
$\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$ the family
$\mathcal{S} = \{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{D} \,\}$ lies in $\mathcal{T}$
and $\bigcap \mathcal{D} = X \setminus \bigcup \mathcal{S}$ is closed by (T2),
which is (C2); and $C \cup D = X \setminus ((X \setminus C) \cap (X \setminus D))$
is closed by (T3), which is (C3). Given (C1)–(C3) the same three lines run
backwards, the empty-union case $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$ being supplied
by (C1) rather than by (C2); and $\{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{C} \,\}$ has
$\mathcal{C}$ as its family of complements because complementation is an
involution.

**Comparison of topologies.** If $\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ are
topologies on the same set $X$ and $\mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2$, then
$\mathcal{T}_1$ is **coarser** than $\mathcal{T}_2$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ is
**finer** than $\mathcal{T}_1$; the comparison is **strict** when the inclusion
is. Inclusion is a partial order on the set of topologies on $X$
([[def-partial-order]]), and it is not a total one: two topologies on the same
set may be incomparable.

### `lem-urysohn-sits-between-hausdorff-and-regular-plus-t1` — lemma — Every Urysohn space is Hausdorff, every Hausdorff space is $T_1$ and hence $T_0$, and every regular $T_1$ space is Urysohn

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]). Then:

1. If $X$ is Urysohn ([[def-urysohn-space]]) then $X$ is Hausdorff
   ([[def-hausdorff-space]]).
2. If $X$ is Hausdorff then $X$ is $T_1$, and hence $T_0$
   ([[def-t0-and-t1-spaces]]).
3. If $X$ is regular ([[def-regular-and-t3-spaces]]) and $T_1$ — that is, if $X$
   is $T_3$ — then $X$ is Urysohn.

Consequently $T_3$ implies $T_{2\frac12}$, which implies $T_2$, which implies
$T_1$, which implies $T_0$. Nothing here asserts that any of the four
implications reverses; two of the failures are recorded among this page's false
statements.

your findings in the block format the brief specifies, ending with the
