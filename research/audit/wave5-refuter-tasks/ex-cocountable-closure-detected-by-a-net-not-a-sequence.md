## Example

Give $\mathbb R$ the cocountable topology, let $A=[0,1]$, and let $p=2$. Then $p\in\overline A$, hence a net in $A$ converges to $p$, but no sequence in $A$ converges to $p$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The cocountable topology on $\mathbb R$, $A=[0,1]$, and $p=2$.

[L1] Nonempty cocountable opens have at most countable complements ([[def-standard-topologies]], [[def-countable]]).

[L2] $[0,1]$ is uncountable ([[cor-interval-uncountable]]).

[L3] A sequence converges only if it is eventually in every neighbourhood of its proposed limit ([[def-sequence-convergence-top]]).

[L4] A point lies in the closure of a subset exactly when some net in that subset converges to it ([[thm-closure-characterised-by-nets]]).


## Verification

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 Every neighbourhood $N$ of $2$ has at most countable complement, so it meets the uncountable set $A$. Hence $2\in\overline A$, and [L4] supplies a net in $A$ converging to $2$. [L1, L2, L4, construct]

1.2 Let $(a_n)$ be a sequence in $A$. Its range is at most countable and omits $2$, so $\mathbb R\setminus\{a_n:n\in\mathbb N\}$ is a neighbourhood of $2$ containing none of its terms. Thus $(a_n)$ does not converge to $2$. [L1, L3]

2.1 The net from step 1.1 detects the closure point, whereas no sequence in $A$ does. [step 1.1, step 1.2, discharge-construct] ∎

### `thm-closure-characterised-by-nets` — theorem — A point lies in the closure of a set if and only if a net in the set converges to it

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Statement

For $A\subseteq X$ and $p\in X$, one has $p\in\overline A$ if and only if there is a net in $A$ converging to $p$.

### `def-standard-topologies` — definition — The discrete, indiscrete, cofinite, cocountable, particular-point and Sierpinski topologies

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Throughout, a topology is as in [[def-topological-space]], and *finite*,
*at most countable* and *uncountable* are as in [[def-countable]], so that
"countable" always means "at most countable" and every finite set is countable.
Let $X$ be a set. The six families below are topologies on $X$; that each really
satisfies (T1), (T2) and (T3) is discharged in full after the list.

1. **Discrete topology.** $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{disc}} := \mathcal{P}(X)$: every
   subset is open, hence every subset is closed, hence every subset is clopen.
2. **Indiscrete topology.** $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{ind}} := \{\varnothing, X\}$.
   Its closed sets are again $\varnothing$ and $X$.
3. **Cofinite topology.**
   $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{cof}} := \{\varnothing\} \cup \{\, U \subseteq X : X \setminus U \text{ is finite} \,\}$.
   Its closed sets are $X$ together with the finite subsets of $X$.
4. **Cocountable topology.**
   $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{coc}} := \{\varnothing\} \cup \{\, U \subseteq X : X \setminus U \text{ is at most countable} \,\}$.
   Its closed sets are $X$ together with the at most countable subsets of $X$.
5. **Particular-point topology.** Fix $p \in X$ and put
   $\mathcal{T}_p := \{\varnothing\} \cup \{\, U \subseteq X : p \in U \,\}$: the
   open sets are $\varnothing$ and the sets containing $p$. Its closed sets are
   $X$ together with the sets **not** containing $p$.
6. **Sierpinski topology.** On a two-point set $S = \{a, b\}$ with $a \ne b$,
   $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{Sier}} := \{\varnothing, \{b\}, S\}$. The pair
   $(S, \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{Sier}})$ is **Sierpinski space**; $b$ is its open
   point and $a$ its closed point. This is exactly the particular-point topology
   of item 5 on a two-point set with particular point $b$, listed separately
   because it is quoted so often.

**Two elementary facts about finite sets are used below, and both are proved
here.**

*(i) A subset of a finite set is finite.* Let $F \approx n$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}$
([[def-equinumerous]], [[def-natural-numbers]]), witnessed by a bijection
$\varphi : F \to n$, and let $B \subseteq F$. Then $\varphi$ restricts to a
bijection of $B$ onto $\varphi[B] \subseteq n$
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]). Every element of the von Neumann natural
$n$ is a natural number strictly smaller than $n$
([[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]), so $\varphi[B]$ is a subset of $\mathbb{N}$
bounded above by $n$, hence finite by the sharper form of
[[lem-subset-of-countable]] ("a subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is finite if it is
bounded above"). Since $\approx$ is symmetric and transitive, $B$ is finite.

*(ii) A union of two finite sets is finite.* First, if $H$ is finite and $g$ is
any object then $H \cup \{g\}$ is finite: if $g \in H$ there is nothing to prove,
and otherwise a bijection $u : H \to k$ extends to a bijection
$H \cup \{g\} \to k \cup \{k\} = \sigma(k)$ by setting $u(g) := k$, which is
injective because $k \notin k$ ([[lem-nat-transitive-irreflexive]]). Now fix a
finite set $F$ and argue by induction ([[thm-induction-principle]]) on
$m \in \mathbb{N}$ over the statement "for every $G$ with $G \approx m$, the union
$F \cup G$ is finite". At $m = 0$ we have $G = \varnothing$ and $F \cup G = F$. At
$m = \sigma(j)$, a bijection $\psi : G \to \sigma(j)$ gives $g := \psi^{-1}(j)$
and $G' := G \setminus \{g\} \approx j$ (restrict $\psi$), so
$F \cup G = (F \cup G') \cup \{g\}$ is finite by the induction hypothesis and the
previous sentence.

**Discharge of the topology axioms.**

*Discrete.* Every subset of $X$ lies in $\mathcal{P}(X)$, so (T1), (T2) and (T3)
hold with nothing to check.

*Indiscrete.* (T1) is the definition. For (T2), a subfamily of
$\{\varnothing, X\}$ has union $\varnothing$ (if it is empty or $\{\varnothing\}$)
or $X$ (otherwise). For (T3), $\varnothing \cap A = \varnothing$ and
$X \cap X = X$.

*Cofinite.* (T1): $\varnothing$ is listed, and $X \setminus X = \varnothing$ is
finite. (T2): let $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{cof}}$. If every
member is $\varnothing$ the union is $\varnothing$. Otherwise fix
$U_0 \in \mathcal{S}$ with $U_0 \ne \varnothing$; then
$X \setminus \bigcup \mathcal{S} \subseteq X \setminus U_0$, which is finite, so
the left side is finite by (i). (T3): for nonempty $U, V$ with finite
complements, $X \setminus (U \cap V) = (X \setminus U) \cup (X \setminus V)$ is
finite by (ii); and if either of $U, V$ is empty so is $U \cap V$. The closed sets
are the complements of the open ones, that is $X = X \setminus \varnothing$
together with the finite sets.

*Cocountable.* Identical to the cofinite case with "at most countable" in place of
"finite": (i) is replaced by [[lem-subset-of-countable]] itself, and (ii) by the
statement that a union of two at most countable sets is at most countable, which
is the two-set instance of [[thm-countable-union-of-countable]] applied to the
family $A_0 := U, A_1 := V, A_k := \varnothing$ for $k \ge 2$.

*Particular point.* (T1): $\varnothing$ is listed and $p \in X$. (T2): a
subfamily whose members are all $\varnothing$ has union $\varnothing$; otherwise
some member contains $p$, hence so does the union. (T3): if $U$ and $V$ both
contain $p$ then so does $U \cap V$; and if either is $\varnothing$ then so is the
intersection.

*Sierpinski.* The special case $X = \{a,b\}$, $p = b$ of the previous paragraph:
the sets containing $b$ are $\{b\}$ and $S$, so
$\mathcal{T}_b = \{\varnothing, \{b\}, S\} = \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{Sier}}$.

### `def-sequence-convergence-top` — definition — Convergence and cluster points of a sequence in a topological space, sequential continuity, and the sequential closure

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]), with
neighbourhoods as in [[def-neighbourhood-top]].

A **sequence in $X$** is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to X$, written $(x_k)$ with
$x_k := x(k)$. As everywhere in this library $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
([[def-natural-numbers]]) and a sequence is indexed from $0$
([[def-sequence]]); an index range copied from a text that starts at $1$ must be
shifted before it is used here. The **range** of $(x_k)$ is
$\{\, x_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\}$. Following [[def-sequence]], a property of
indices holds **eventually** if it holds for all $k \ge K$ for some
$K \in \mathbb{N}$, and **frequently** if for every $K$ it holds for some
$k \ge K$; that vocabulary is used here for sequences in an arbitrary set.

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence in $X$ and let $p \in X$.

- $(x_k)$ **converges to $p$**, written $x_k \to p$, if for every neighbourhood
  $N$ of $p$ one has $x_k \in N$ eventually. The point $p$ is then called **a
  limit of $(x_k)$**.
- $p$ is a **cluster point** of $(x_k)$ if for every neighbourhood $N$ of $p$ one
  has $x_k \in N$ frequently.
- For $A \subseteq X$, the **sequential closure** of $A$ is
  $$\operatorname{seqcl}(A) := \{\, p \in X : x_k \to p \text{ for some sequence } (x_k) \text{ with } x_k \in A \text{ for all } k \,\} .$$
- A function $f : X \to Y$ into a topological space $Y$ is **sequentially
  continuous at $p$** if $x_k \to p$ in $X$ implies $f(x_k) \to f(p)$ in $Y$, and
  **sequentially continuous** if it is sequentially continuous at every point of
  $X$ ([[def-continuous-map-top]] for the ordinary notion).

**The notation $\lim_k x_k$ is not available at this generality, and the reason
is not fastidiousness.** In a general topological space a sequence may converge
to more than one point, so there is no function taking a convergent sequence to
"its" limit, and a symbol $\lim_k x_k$ would not denote. In the indiscrete
topology on a set with at least two points the only neighbourhood of any point is
$X$, so **every** sequence converges to **every** point; in the cofinite topology
on an infinite set every injective sequence converges to every point. Both
witnesses are on the companion page. Accordingly this library writes "$p$ is *a*
limit of $(x_k)$" and "$(x_k)$ converges to $p$", never "*the* limit" and never
$\lim_k x_k$, for a sequence in a space that has not been given a hypothesis
restoring uniqueness.

**Where the notation becomes legitimate again.** Uniqueness of limits is what
licenses the symbol, exactly as it does for sequences of reals
([[lem-limit-unique]]) and in a metric space ([[lem-metric-limits-unique]]): in a
metric space a sequence has at most one limit and $\lim_k x_k$ is unambiguous.
Every metrizable space therefore admits the notation, and so does every space in
which distinct points have disjoint neighbourhoods; where this page uses a
metrizable space, and only there, the usual notation is used without further
comment. The general reading of "$x_k \to p$" above never presupposes it.

**Convergence agrees with the metric notion on a metric topology.** For a metric
space the balls around $p$ are a neighbourhood base at $p$
([[lem-metric-ball-neighbourhood-base]]), so "eventually in every neighbourhood
of $p$" and "eventually in every ball around $p$" are the same condition, and the
latter is [[def-metric-convergence]]. The identification is carried out where
metrizable spaces are defined, later on this page.

### `def-countable` — definition — Finite, countably infinite, countable, uncountable

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Recall that a natural number is a von Neumann natural
([[def-natural-numbers]]): $0 = \varnothing$ and $\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$, so
that

$$n = \{\, m \in \mathbb{N} : m < n \,\} = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$$

is itself the set of its predecessors. Here $<$ is the order of
[[def-nat-order]], which is defined additively, so the displayed identity is a
theorem and not a convention: it is [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]], proved
immediately above. Let $A$ be a set, and let $\approx$ be equinumerosity
([[def-equinumerous]]).

- $A$ is **finite** if $A \approx n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
- $A$ is **countably infinite** if $A \approx \mathbb{N}$.
- $A$ is **at most countable** if it is finite or countably infinite.
- $A$ is **uncountable** if it is not at most countable.

### `cor-interval-uncountable` — corollary — Every nondegenerate interval of $\\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $\mathbb{R}$ be a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and
let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$. Then both

1. the closed interval $[a,b] = \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : a \le x \le b \,\}$, and
2. the open interval $(a,b) = \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : a < x < b \,\}$

are uncountable ([[def-countable]]).

**What this adds to [[thm-r-uncountable]], and what it does not inherit from it.**
That theorem states exactly one thing: $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable. Its statement
says nothing about any interval, so the present result cannot be read off it. Its
*proof*, on the other hand, is general in every part but its seed: the trisection
rule of its step 2.1 is constructed there for an arbitrary $(a,b) \in I$, and its
steps 4.1, 5.1 and 6.1, together with the interval reasoning of its step 7.1, use
nothing about the starting interval beyond the nesting and the strictness
$a_n < b_n$ that the rule delivers. Only three places are special to $\mathbb{R}$
and to $(0,1)$: the surjection of its step 1.1 is onto $\mathbb{R}$, the recursion
of its step 3.1 is seeded at $(0,(0,1))$, and the conclusion drawn in its step 7.1
is about $\mathbb{R}$. So the construction is re-run below, seeded
instead at the **middle third** of $(a,b)$, against a surjection onto $(a,b)$; the
remarks record why that seed and not $(a,b)$ itself.
