## Example
Assume countable choice. Successor ordinals and $0$ are isolated. If
$\alpha<\omega_1$ is a nonzero limit, enumerate the at most countable ordinal
$\alpha$ and take the successive finite suprema of that enumeration; the
result is a countable cofinal sequence, and the corresponding final intervals
$(\beta_n,\alpha]$ form a local base at $\alpha$. Thus $\omega_1$ is first
countable. The published ordinal theorem makes it countably compact.

Every at most countable subset $D\subseteq\omega_1$ is bounded by some
$\beta<\omega_1$, so the nonempty open tail above $\beta$ misses $D$; hence
$\omega_1$ is not separable. The open initial segments
$\{\,[0,\beta] : \beta<\omega_1\,\}$ cover $\omega_1$, but any at most countable
subfamily has bounded union and therefore fails to cover. Thus $\omega_1$ is
not Lindelöf.

## The dependencies it declares, quoted verbatim from disk

Each block below is the claim-bearing text of one declared dependency.
These are the only statements the item is entitled to use. If a step
needs more than the text below gives, that is the defect — quote the
dependency text and show exactly what it fails to supply.

### `def-first-countable-top` — definition — First countable space: a countable neighbourhood base at every point

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ ([[def-topological-space]]) is **first
countable** if every point of $X$ has an at most countable neighbourhood base:
for each $x \in X$ there is a family
$\mathcal{B}_x \subseteq \mathcal{N}(x)$ that is at most countable
([[def-countable]], [[def-equinumerous]]) and such that every neighbourhood of
$x$ contains a member of $\mathcal{B}_x$ ([[def-neighbourhood-top]]).

**"Countable" here means "at most countable"**, as everywhere in this library
([[def-countable]]), so a *finite* neighbourhood base is permitted. That is not a
degenerate case: in a discrete space the one-element family $\{\{x\}\}$ is a
neighbourhood base at $x$, so every discrete space is first countable, and in an
indiscrete space $\{X\}$ is a neighbourhood base at every point.

**The base may be taken to consist of open sets, and it may be taken
decreasing.** If $\mathcal{B}_x$ is an at most countable neighbourhood base at
$x$, then replacing each $N \in \mathcal{B}_x$ by an open $U_N$ with
$x \in U_N \subseteq N$ gives an at most countable neighbourhood base of open
sets. Making the base decreasing, that is arranging
$M_0 \supseteq M_1 \supseteq \dots$, requires enumerating it and forming the
running finite intersections; both operations are carried out inside the proof of
the theorem that uses them, the next item, where the enumeration and the
recursion are cited explicitly rather than assumed here.

**First countability is a topological property**
([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]): a homeomorphism $h : X \to Y$ carries a
neighbourhood base at $x$ to a neighbourhood base at $h(x)$, since
$N \mapsto h[N]$ is a bijection between the neighbourhood filters preserving
inclusion, and a bijection preserves at most countability
([[def-equinumerous]]).

### `def-separable-space` — definition — Separability: the existence of an at most countable dense subset

(statement provenance: literature-derived)

### Definition

A topological space $X$ is **separable** if some at most countable subset $D\subseteq X$ is dense in $X$ ([[def-dense-top]], [[def-countable]]). Equivalently, every nonempty open subset of $X$ meets $D$.

### `def-compactness-variants` — definition — Countably compact, Lindel\\\"of, sequentially compact, limit point compact and $\\sigma$-compact spaces, and relatively compact subsets

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]), with
open covers, subcovers, finiteness and compactness as in [[def-compact-space]],
and *finite*, *at most countable* and *uncountable* as in [[def-countable]].

- $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is **countably compact** when every open cover of $X$ that
  is at most countable has a finite subcover.
- $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is **Lindel&ouml;f** when every open cover of $X$ has an at
  most countable subcover.
- $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is **sequentially compact** when every sequence $(x_k)$ in
  $X$, that is every function $x : \mathbb{N} \to X$
  ([[def-sequence-convergence-top]]), has a subsequence $(x_{n_j})$ converging to
  a point of $X$, the index map $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ being strictly
  increasing ([[def-sequence]], [[lem-index-map-grows]]).
- $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is **limit point compact** when every infinite subset
  $A \subseteq X$ has a limit point in $X$, that is a point $p \in X$ every
  neighbourhood $N$ of which satisfies $N \cap (A \setminus \{p\}) \ne \varnothing$
  ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]). Here *infinite* means not finite in
  the sense of [[def-countable]].
- $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is **$\sigma$-compact** when there is an at most countable
  family $\mathcal{K}$ of compact subsets of $X$ with $X = \bigcup \mathcal{K}$.
- A subset $A \subseteq X$ is **relatively compact in $X$** when its closure
  $\overline{A}$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]) is a compact subset of
  $X$.

A subset $A \subseteq X$ is called countably compact, Lindel&ouml;f,
sequentially compact, limit point compact or $\sigma$-compact when the subspace
$(A, \mathcal{T}_A)$ is ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]), exactly as for
compactness. **Relative compactness is the exception and is deliberately not of
that form**: it is a statement about $A$ *inside* $X$, since $\overline{A}$ is
computed in $X$, and a set may be relatively compact in one space and not in
another that contains it. Every other notion on this list is intrinsic to the
subspace.

**The countable covers may be listed.** A nonempty at most countable family
$\mathcal{U}$ admits a surjection $\mathbb{N} \to \mathcal{U}$
([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]]), so countable compactness says: for
every sequence $(U_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of open sets with
$X = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} U_n$ there are finitely many indices whose sets
already cover $X$. That surjection is produced from the countability assumption
alone and no choice principle is involved; the empty family covers only the empty
space, which is compact anyway.

**Indexing starts at $0$.** A sequence here is a function on $\mathbb{N}$ and
$\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$ ([[def-sequence]]), so a subsequence is
$(x_{n_j})_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ with $n_0 < n_1 < \cdots$ and $n_j \ge j$
([[lem-index-map-grows]]). An index range taken from a text that starts at $1$
must be shifted before it is used here.

**Agreement with the metric definitions.** Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space carrying
its metric topology $\mathcal{T}_d$ ([[def-metric-topology]],
[[def-metrizable-space]]). Then the three notions that
[[def-metric-compactness-variants]] defines metrically are the three defined
above, read in $(X, \mathcal{T}_d)$:

- *Countably compact.* The open sets used there are the members of
  $\mathcal{T}_d$, so the at most countable open covers are the same families and
  the condition is the same condition, exactly as for compactness itself
  ([[thm-compactness-agrees-with-metric-compactness]]).
- *Sequentially compact.* Convergence of a sequence in the metric sense and in
  the sense of [[def-sequence-convergence-top]] agree on a metric topology,
  because the balls around a point are a neighbourhood base at it
  ([[def-metrizable-space]]); the subsequences quantified over are the same.
- *Limit point compact.* A point $p$ is a limit point of $A$ in the metric sense
  when every ball around $p$ meets $A \setminus \{p\}$, and in the sense above
  when every neighbourhood does; the same neighbourhood base makes the two
  conditions one ([[def-metrizable-space]],
  [[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

So no statement below about a metrizable space introduces a second notion, and
every theorem of the metric development about these three properties may be
quoted here once a metric inducing the topology is named. Lindel&ouml;fness,
$\sigma$-compactness and relative compactness have no metric counterpart in this
library and are defined here for the first time.

### `def-order-topology-on-an-ordinal` — definition — The order topology on an ordinal, with the half-open intervals $(\\alpha, \\beta]$ and the initial segments $[0, \\beta]$ as a basis

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $\gamma$ be an ordinal ([[def-ordinal]]). Since $\gamma$ is the set of
ordinals below it and $\xi < \eta$ means $\xi \in \eta$, the following two
families of subsets of $\gamma$ are defined for $\beta \in \gamma$ and
$\alpha \in \gamma$:

$$[0,\beta] \;:=\; \{\, \xi \in \gamma : \xi \le \beta \,\} \;=\; \beta^{+}, \qquad (\alpha,\beta] \;:=\; \{\, \xi \in \gamma : \alpha < \xi \le \beta \,\} \;=\; \beta^{+} \setminus \alpha^{+} .$$

Both identifications are immediate: $\beta^{+} = \beta \cup \{\beta\}$ is the set
of ordinals $\le \beta$, and it is a subset of $\gamma$ because $\gamma$ is
transitive and $\beta \in \gamma$ ([[def-ordinal]], [[lem-ordinal-basics]]).

Put

$$\mathcal{B}_\gamma \;:=\; \{\, [0,\beta] : \beta \in \gamma \,\} \;\cup\; \{\, (\alpha,\beta] : \alpha, \beta \in \gamma,\ \alpha < \beta \,\} .$$

**$\mathcal{B}_\gamma$ is a basis for a unique topology on $\gamma$**
([[thm-basis-criterion]], [[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]), and that topology is
the **order topology on $\gamma$**. The obligation is discharged here.

*(B1), covering.* If $\xi \in \gamma$ then $\xi \in [0,\xi] \in \mathcal{B}_\gamma$,
so $\bigcup \mathcal{B}_\gamma = \gamma$. For $\gamma = 0 = \varnothing$ the
family is empty and $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing = \gamma$, so (B1) holds
there too.

*(B2), intersections.* By trichotomy of the ordinals ([[lem-ordinal-trichotomy]])
any two ordinals have a maximum and a minimum, namely the larger and the smaller
of the two, and for $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \beta_1, \beta_2 \in \gamma$:

- $[0,\beta_1] \cap [0,\beta_2] = [0, \min\{\beta_1,\beta_2\}]$;
- $[0,\beta_1] \cap (\alpha_2,\beta_2] = (\alpha_2, \min\{\beta_1,\beta_2\}]$ when
  $\alpha_2 < \min\{\beta_1,\beta_2\}$, and $\varnothing$ otherwise;
- $(\alpha_1,\beta_1] \cap (\alpha_2,\beta_2] = (\max\{\alpha_1,\alpha_2\},\ \min\{\beta_1,\beta_2\}]$
  when $\max\{\alpha_1,\alpha_2\} < \min\{\beta_1,\beta_2\}$, and $\varnothing$
  otherwise.

In each case the intersection is either a member of $\mathcal{B}_\gamma$ or
empty, and in the empty case (B2) is vacuous, having no point to test. So (B2)
holds, and [[thm-basis-criterion]] supplies the topology and its uniqueness.

**This definition is for ordinals only, and it says so.** The general order
topology of a linearly ordered set takes the open intervals, together with the
initial and final rays, as a basis. For an ordinal that family is the wrong one:
a successor $\beta^{+}$ has an immediate predecessor, so the smallest open
interval around it is already $\{\beta^{+}\}$, but no *interval* of the form
$(\alpha,\eta)$ isolates $0$, and the initial segments must be supplied
separately. The family $\mathcal{B}_\gamma$ above is exactly the general order
basis for an ordinal, rewritten so that no case analysis is needed; nothing here
claims to define the order topology of an arbitrary linearly ordered set, and no
statement on this page is about such a set.

**Isolated and non-isolated points.** Every ordinal is $0$, a successor, or a
limit ([[def-limit-ordinal]]). If $\xi = 0$ then $\{\xi\} = [0,0]$ is basic open;
if $\xi = \alpha^{+}$ then $\{\xi\} = (\alpha, \xi]$ is basic open; so every
non-limit point of $\gamma$ is isolated. If $\xi$ is a limit ordinal then every
basic set containing $\xi$ contains some $(\alpha,\xi]$ with $\alpha < \xi$, and
$\alpha^{+} < \xi$ because $\xi$ is a limit, so $\alpha^{+}$ is a second point of
that basic set; hence a limit point of $\gamma$ is not isolated. In particular
$\omega$, the least limit ordinal ([[lem-omega-least-limit-ordinal]]), is the
unique non-isolated point of $\omega + 1$, and every ordinal $\gamma \le \omega$
carries the discrete topology ([[def-standard-topologies]]).

### `thm-countable-subsets-of-omega-one-are-bounded` — theorem — Assuming countable choice: every at most countable subset of $\\omega_1$ is bounded below $\\omega_1$, so no at most countable subset of $\\omega_1$ is cofinal in it, and a supremum of at most countably many at most countable ordinals is at most countable

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

**Assume the Axiom of Countable Choice $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$**
([[def-countable-choice]]). Let $\omega_1$ be the first uncountable ordinal
([[def-first-uncountable-ordinal]]). Then:

**(a) Boundedness.** Every at most countable ([[def-countable]]) subset
$A \subseteq \omega_1$ is bounded below $\omega_1$: the ordinal
$\sup A = \bigcup A$ lies in $\omega_1$ and satisfies $\alpha \le \sup A$ for
every $\alpha \in A$.

**(b) No small cofinal set.** No at most countable subset of $\omega_1$ is
cofinal in $\omega_1$ ([[def-cofinal-subset-of-an-ordinal]]).

**(c) Suprema stay countable.** If $A$ is an at most countable set of at most
countable ordinals, then $\sup A = \bigcup A$ is an at most countable ordinal.

**The hypothesis is not decoration.** $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ is spent at exactly
one step, step 1.2 below, and it is spent there only through
[[thm-countable-union-of-countable]], whose own statement carries the same
hypothesis. Everything else on this page, including the existence of $\omega_1$
and all of [[thm-omega-one-is-the-least-uncountable-ordinal]], is a theorem of
ZF. The ledger is the choice-ledger remark at the end of this page.

### `thm-ordinal-spaces-and-compactness` — theorem — Every successor ordinal is compact in its order topology and every limit ordinal is not; and, assuming countable choice, $\\omega_1$ is countably compact and sequentially compact while $\\omega_1 + 1$ is compact

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Every ordinal carries the order topology of the membership order on it
([[def-ordinal]], [[def-order-topology-on-a-linearly-ordered-set]]), with the
clopen basis $\mathcal{B}_\gamma$ of
[[lem-the-order-topology-on-an-ordinal]]. Then:

1. **Successors are compact.** For every ordinal $\delta$ the successor ordinal
   $\delta^{+}$ is compact ([[def-compact-space]]).
2. **Limits are not.** No limit ordinal ([[def-limit-ordinal]]) is compact.
3. **Assuming the Axiom of Countable Choice** ([[def-countable-choice]]): the
   first uncountable ordinal $\omega_1$ ([[def-first-uncountable-ordinal]]) is
   sequentially compact and countably compact ([[def-compactness-variants]]),
   and it is not compact; while $\omega_1 + 1$ is compact
   ([[def-ordinal-addition]]).

Claims 1 and 2 are theorems of ZF. Claim 3 spends countable choice twice, both
times through cited results that carry the hypothesis in their own statements:
[[thm-countable-subsets-of-omega-one-are-bounded]], which supplies the
boundedness of at most countable subsets of $\omega_1$, and claim 2 of
[[thm-compactness-variants-hierarchy]], which converts sequential compactness
into countable compactness; the extraction of a subsequence below selects
nothing, taking least elements throughout.
