## Statement

If $X$ is first countable and $x\in X$, then $x$ has a countable local base $(V_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ of open sets with $V_{n+1}\subseteq V_n$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A countable local base at $x$ ([[def-first-countable-top]]).

[L1] Each neighbourhood of $x$ contains an open neighbourhood of $x$ ([[def-neighbourhood-top]]).

[L2] Every nonempty at most countable set is a surjective image of $\mathbb N$ ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]], [[def-countable]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 A local base is nonempty, so enumerate it as $(B_n)$ by [L2], with repetitions allowed. Put $U_n=\operatorname{int}(B_n)$. Since $B_n$ is a neighbourhood of $x$, its interior is open, contains $x$, and is contained in $B_n$. This definition is canonical and uses no countable choice. [given, L1, L2, construct]

2.1 Put $V_n=U_0\cap\cdots\cap U_n$; each $V_n$ is open, contains $x$, and $V_{n+1}\subseteq V_n$. [step 1.1, construct]

3.1 Since $V_n\subseteq B_n$, every neighbourhood contains some $V_n$, so $(V_n)$ is the required decreasing local base. [step 2.1, discharge-construct] ∎

## The dependencies it declares, quoted verbatim from disk

Each block below is the claim-bearing text of one declared dependency.
These are the only statements the item is entitled to use. If a step
needs more than the text below gives, that is the defect — quote the
dependency text and show exactly what it fails to supply.

### `def-first-countable-top` — definition — First countable space: a countable neighbourhood base at every point

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ ([[def-topological-space]]) is **first
countable** if every point of $X$ has an at most countable neighbourhood base:
for each $x \in X$ there is a family
$\mathcal{B}_x \subseteq \mathcal{N}(x)$ that is at most countable
([[def-countable]], [[def-equinumerous]]) and such that every neighbourhood of
$x$ contains a member of $\mathcal{B}_x$ ([[def-neighbourhood-top]]).

**"Countable" here means "at most countable"**, as everywhere in this library
([[def-countable]]), so a *finite* neighbourhood base is permitted. That is not a
degenerate case: in a discrete space the one-element family $\{\{x\}\}$ is a
neighbourhood base at $x$, so every discrete space is first countable, and in an
indiscrete space $\{X\}$ is a neighbourhood base at every point.

**The base may be taken to consist of open sets, and it may be taken
decreasing.** If $\mathcal{B}_x$ is an at most countable neighbourhood base at
$x$, then replacing each $N \in \mathcal{B}_x$ by an open $U_N$ with
$x \in U_N \subseteq N$ gives an at most countable neighbourhood base of open
sets. Making the base decreasing, that is arranging
$M_0 \supseteq M_1 \supseteq \dots$, requires enumerating it and forming the
running finite intersections; both operations are carried out inside the proof of
the theorem that uses them, the next item, where the enumeration and the
recursion are cited explicitly rather than assumed here.

**First countability is a topological property**
([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]): a homeomorphism $h : X \to Y$ carries a
neighbourhood base at $x$ to a neighbourhood base at $h(x)$, since
$N \mapsto h[N]$ is a bijection between the neighbourhood filters preserving
inclusion, and a bijection preserves at most countability
([[def-equinumerous]]).

### `def-neighbourhood-top` — definition — Neighbourhood of a point and neighbourhood base, with this library's convention that a neighbourhood need not be open

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]) and let
$x \in X$.

A set $N \subseteq X$ is a **neighbourhood of $x$** if there is an open
$U \in \mathcal{T}$ with $x \in U \subseteq N$. The family of all neighbourhoods
of $x$ is written $\mathcal{N}(x)$ and called the **neighbourhood filter** at
$x$. A neighbourhood that is itself open is an **open neighbourhood**.

**Convention, and it is a live fork: in this library a neighbourhood need not be
open.** The competing convention, used by Munkres among others, defines a
neighbourhood of $x$ to be an *open* set containing $x$. Both are in current use;
this library follows the one above and writes "open neighbourhood" in full
whenever openness is wanted, so that no statement here depends on which
convention a reader brings.

A family $\mathcal{B}_x \subseteq \mathcal{N}(x)$ is a **neighbourhood base at
$x$** if every neighbourhood of $x$ contains a member of $\mathcal{B}_x$: for
every $N \in \mathcal{N}(x)$ there is $B \in \mathcal{B}_x$ with $B \subseteq N$.

**Four immediate consequences, established here because they are used
constantly.**

1. *$X$ is a neighbourhood of each of its points*, since $x \in X \subseteq X$
   and $X$ is open by (T1); so $\mathcal{N}(x) \ne \varnothing$ and every point
   has at least one neighbourhood base, namely $\mathcal{N}(x)$ itself.
2. *A superset of a neighbourhood of $x$ is a neighbourhood of $x$*: if
   $x \in U \subseteq N \subseteq M$ with $U$ open then $x \in U \subseteq M$.
3. *The intersection of two neighbourhoods of $x$ is a neighbourhood of $x$*: if
   $x \in U \subseteq N$ and $x \in V \subseteq M$ with $U, V$ open, then
   $U \cap V$ is open by (T3) and $x \in U \cap V \subseteq N \cap M$. By
   iteration the same holds for any intersection of finitely many
   neighbourhoods of $x$.
4. *A set is open exactly when it is a neighbourhood of each of its points.* If
   $U$ is open and $x \in U$ then $x \in U \subseteq U$. Conversely, if $N$ is a
   neighbourhood of each of its points, choose for each $x \in N$ an open $U_x$
   with $x \in U_x \subseteq N$; then $N = \bigcup_{x \in N} U_x$ is open by (T2).
   No choice principle is involved: $U_x$ may be taken to be the union of *all*
   open subsets of $N$ containing $x$, which is determined by $x$ and $N$, and is
   open by (T2).

**Basic sets give neighbourhood bases.** If $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for
$\mathcal{T}$ ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]) then
$\mathcal{B}_x := \{\, B \in \mathcal{B} : x \in B \,\}$ is a neighbourhood base
at $x$ consisting of open sets. Each such $B$ is open and contains $x$, hence is
a neighbourhood of $x$; and if $N \in \mathcal{N}(x)$, fix open $U$ with
$x \in U \subseteq N$ and then $B \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B \subseteq U$,
which gives $B \in \mathcal{B}_x$ with $B \subseteq N$. A member of
$\mathcal{B}_x$ is called a **basic neighbourhood** of $x$.

### `def-countable` — definition — Finite, countably infinite, countable, uncountable

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Definition

Recall that a natural number is a von Neumann natural
([[def-natural-numbers]]): $0 = \varnothing$ and $\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$, so
that

$$n = \{\, m \in \mathbb{N} : m < n \,\} = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$$

is itself the set of its predecessors. Here $<$ is the order of
[[def-nat-order]], which is defined additively, so the displayed identity is a
theorem and not a convention: it is [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]], proved
immediately above. Let $A$ be a set, and let $\approx$ be equinumerosity
([[def-equinumerous]]).

- $A$ is **finite** if $A \approx n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
- $A$ is **countably infinite** if $A \approx \mathbb{N}$.
- $A$ is **at most countable** if it is finite or countably infinite.
- $A$ is **uncountable** if it is not at most countable.

### `lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n` — lemma — A nonempty set is at most countable iff it is a surjective image of $\\mathbb{N}$

(statement provenance: ai-altered)

### Statement

Let $A$ be a nonempty set. Then $A$ is at most countable ([[def-countable]]) if
and only if there is a surjection $s : \mathbb{N} \to A$
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

Moreover, from any such surjection an injection $A \to \mathbb{N}$ is obtained
explicitly, without any choice, by

$$j(a) := \min\{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : s(k) = a \,\}.$$

This is the working form of countability used everywhere below: to prove a
nonempty set countable it suffices to list its elements, repetitions and all.

**No choice principle is used.** The backward direction is where an appeal to
choice would be natural ("for each $a$ pick some $k$ with $s(k) = a$") and it is
avoided outright, because $\min$ is canonical: every nonempty set of naturals has
a *least* element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]), so $j(a)$ is determined by
$a$ and $s$ alone.
