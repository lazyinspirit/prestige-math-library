You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as a
read-only adversarial proof-refuter for the published-page audit. You are
tool-less: you cannot open a file, run a command, browse, edit, or delegate.
Everything you may rely on is reproduced in the `This dispatch` section. Return
evidence only; Audit-Alpha alone adjudicates and edits.

## Triage — the standing rule (verbatim, binding on you)

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct
  citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

## Adversarial standard

Read the target's title, Statement/Definition/Example/Statement refuted, Facts &
Assumptions, every numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks.
Try to falsify the public claim and every load-bearing inference.

1. Compare every cited fact with the supplied source text before alleging that
   it is weak. Check domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, direction, conclusion,
   and whether the source licenses the exact use.
2. Check that the title and public statement assert no more than the proof
   establishes, and that every proof step uses only available premises.
3. Check both directions of biconditionals, uniqueness/existence claims,
   induction and limiting arguments, empty/zero/endpoint/degenerate cases,
   extended-real conventions, index shifts, and hidden division or choice.
4. Re-read Remarks as skeptically as a numbered step. A false mathematical
   remark is a defect even when the proof is sound.
5. When the target is marked `ai-generated`, actively search for a
   counterexample to its claim, witness, or refutation rather than merely
   checking prose consistency.
6. Treat a false public claim, logically invalid proof, missing necessary
   hypothesis, circularity, or materially inaccurate load-bearing citation as
   fatal. Do not inflate an expository omission or a gap closable within thirty
   seconds into a defect.

## Output format

Reply with exactly this structure and no preamble:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS

  location: [exact title, section, fact label, or numbered step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [the exact mathematical assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, missing hypothesis, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]

## Statement

Let $r \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $r^k$ be the integer power ([[def-integer-power]]),
so that $r^0 = 1$ for every $r$, including $r = 0$.

1. If $|r| < 1$ then the series $\sum r^k$ converges ([[def-series]]) and
   $$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} r^{k} \;=\; \frac{1}{1-r} .$$
2. If $|r| \ge 1$ then $\sum r^k$ diverges.

The series starts at $k = 0$ and its first term is $r^0 = 1$; in particular
$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} 2^{-k} = 2$, while the series starting at $k = 1$ sums to
$1$. Which starting index is meant has to be said, and it is said here.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real number $r$, the integer powers $r^k$ ([[def-integer-power]]), and the partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} r^k$ of $\sum r^k$ ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[L1] Factorisation of a difference of powers: for $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and natural $n \ge 1$, $b^n - a^n = (b-a)\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a^k b^{\,n-1-k}$ ([[lem-power-difference-factorisation]]).

[L2] For $|r| < 1$ the sequence $(r^k)$ is null, that is $r^k \to 0$ ([[lem-geometric-sequence-null]]).

[L3] Algebra of limits: sums, differences and quotients of convergent sequences converge to the corresponding combination, the quotient rule requiring a nonzero limit and nonzero denominators ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L4] Absolute value: $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$, $|x| \ge 0$, and $|x| = 0$ exactly when $x = 0$; also $|1| = 1$, since $1 > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L5] Powers and order: $a^0 = 1$ for every $a$; if $a \ge 1$ and $n \ge 1$ then $a^n \ge a \ge 1$; and $1^n = 1$ for every $n$ ([[lem-power-monotone]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L6] The principle of induction ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L7] If a series converges then its terms tend to $0$ ([[lem-nth-term-test]]).

[L8] Notation of [[def-finite-sum]]: $\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x_k$ is $\sum_{k<n} x_k$, and the empty sum $\sum_{k<0} x_k$ is $0$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Assume $|r| < 1$. [assume-case lt]

1.2 Assume instead $|r| \ge 1$. [assume-case ge]

1.3 For every natural $n \ge 1$, applying [L1] with $b = 1$ and $a = r$ gives $1 - r^n = (1-r)\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} r^k \cdot 1^{\,n-1-k} = (1-r)\,s_n$, using $1^m = 1$ and the notation of [L8]. [L1, L5, L8]

1.4 At $n = 0$ the identity $1 - r^n = (1-r)s_n$ also holds, both sides being $0$ because $r^0 = 1$ and $s_0$ is the empty sum. [L5, L8]

2.1 In the case $|r| < 1$ we have $r \ne 1$, since $|1| = 1$ and $|r| < 1$; hence $1 - r \ne 0$. [step 1.1, L4, algebra]

2.2 In the case $|r| \ge 1$, an induction gives $|r^k| = |r|^k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$: at $k = 0$ both sides are $1$, and if $|r^k| = |r|^k$ then $|r^{k+1}| = |r^k \cdot r| = |r^k|\,|r| = |r|^k |r| = |r|^{k+1}$. [step 1.2, L4, L5, L6]

2.3 In the case $|r| \ge 1$ we get $|r|^k \ge 1$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$: at $k = 0$ this reads $1 \ge 1$, and for $k \ge 1$ it is the comparison $|r|^k \ge |r| \ge 1$. [step 1.2, L5]

3.1 In the case $|r| < 1$, dividing by $1 - r \ne 0$ gives $s_n = (1 - r^n)/(1-r)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.1, step 1.3, step 1.4, algebra]

3.2 In the case $|r| \ge 1$, combining the two previous steps gives $|r^k - 0| = |r^k| = |r|^k \ge 1$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.2, step 2.3]

4.1 In the case $|r| < 1$ the sequence $(r^n)$ is null, so $1 - r^n \to 1$ and therefore $s_n \to 1/(1-r)$, the denominator being the nonzero constant $1-r$; hence $\sum r^k$ converges with sum $1/(1-r)$, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 3.1, step 2.1, L2, L3]

4.2 In the case $|r| \ge 1$ the sequence $(r^k)$ does not converge to $0$, since the rational tolerance $\varepsilon = 1$ admits no index $K$ with $|r^k - 0| < 1$ for all $k \ge K$; so by the term test $\sum r^k$ diverges, which is claim 2. [step 3.2, L7]

5.1 The two cases $|r| < 1$ and $|r| \ge 1$ exhaust the possibilities, since the order on $\mathbb{R}$ is total, so claims 1 and 2 together cover every real $r$. [step 4.1, step 4.2, cases-exhaustive] ∎

## Remarks

- **The divergence half needs no separate treatment of $r = 1$ and $r = -1$.** Both are covered by $|r| \ge 1$, and the single reason is the same in every case: the terms have absolute value at least $1$, so they cannot tend to $0$. For $r = 1$ the partial sums are $s_n = n$ and run to $+\infty$; for $r = -1$ they oscillate between $0$ and $1$. The theorem says only that neither converges, which is all that "diverges" means here ([[def-series]]).

- **Why the identity is proved at $n = 0$ separately.** [[lem-power-difference-factorisation]] requires $n \ge 1$, since its right-hand side is a sum over $k < n$ of a term involving $b^{\,n-1-k}$, and $n-1$ is not a natural number at $n = 0$. The identity is still true at $n = 0$, but by inspection of two empty objects rather than by that lemma, and step 1.4 says so rather than letting the reader assume the citation covers it.

The same construction with starting\nelement $(0, 1)$ and $f(n, p) = (\\sigma(n),\\, p \\cdot a_n)$, with the same\ninduction on the first coordinate and the same uniqueness argument, gives the\nunique $\\Pi : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ with\n\n$$\\Pi_0 = 1, \\qquad \\Pi_{\\sigma(n)} = \\Pi_n \\cdot a_n ,$$\n\nand we write $\\prod_{k < n} a_k := \\Pi_n$.\n\n**Notation.** For $m, n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ we abbreviate\n\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \\sum_{k < n+1} a_k, \\qquad \\prod_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \\prod_{k < n+1} a_k,$$\n\nand, for a general lower index $m$ with $m \\le n + 1$, writing $d = n + 1 - m$\nfor the number of terms,\n\n$$\\sum_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \\sum_{j < d} a_{m+j}, \\qquad \\prod_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \\prod_{j < d} a_{m+j} .$$\n\nWhen $m = n + 1$ we have $d = 0$ and the sum is **empty**, with value $0$, while\nthe empty product has value $1$.

## Definition

Throughout this page $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), in particular an ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]]) and a field ([[def-field]]), and $\mathbb{N}$ is the set
of natural numbers ([[def-natural-numbers]]) with successor $\sigma(n) = n + 1$
([[def-nat-addition]]).

Let $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a sequence of reals, written $a_k$ for
$a(k)$. **Finite sums and finite products of $a$ are defined by recursion on the
upper index**, which is legitimate because of the recursion theorem
([[thm-recursion]]). That theorem produces a function of one variable, so the
running index has to be carried along inside the value: applying it to the set
$A = \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$, the starting element $(0, 0)$ and the function
$f(n, s) = (\sigma(n),\, s + a_n)$ gives a unique
$g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$ with

$$g(0) = (0, 0), \qquad g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n)) \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Write $g(n) = \big(\pi_1(g(n)),\, \Sigma_n\big)$ for its two coordinates.

**The first coordinate is the index itself, and that is a small induction, not an
observation** ([[thm-induction-principle]]). Indeed $\pi_1(g(0)) = 0$; and if
$\pi_1(g(n)) = n$, then
$g(\sigma(n)) = f\big(\pi_1(g(n)), \Sigma_n\big) = \big(\sigma(\pi_1(g(n))),\, \Sigma_n + a_{\pi_1(g(n))}\big) = \big(\sigma(n),\, \Sigma_n + a_n\big)$,
so $\pi_1(g(\sigma(n))) = \sigma(n)$. By induction $\pi_1(g(n)) = n$ for every
$n \in \mathbb{N}$. Only now may the second coordinate of the two displayed
clauses be read off, and doing so gives

$$\Sigma_0 = 0, \qquad \Sigma_{\sigma(n)} = \Sigma_n + a_n .$$

$\Sigma$ is moreover the **unique** function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with those
two properties: if $\Sigma'$ also has them then $n \mapsto (n, \Sigma'_n)$ satisfies
the two clauses defining $g$, hence equals $g$ by the uniqueness clause of
[[thm-recursion]], so $\Sigma' = \Sigma$.

We write $\sum_{k < n} a_k := \Sigma_n$. The same construction with starting
element $(0, 1)$ and $f(n, p) = (\sigma(n),\, p \cdot a_n)$, with the same
induction on the first coordinate and the same uniqueness argument, gives the
unique $\Pi : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with

$$\Pi_0 = 1, \qquad \Pi_{\sigma(n)} = \Pi_n \cdot a_n ,$$

and we write $\prod_{k < n} a_k := \Pi_n$.

**Notation.** For $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ we abbreviate

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \sum_{k < n+1} a_k, \qquad \prod_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \prod_{k < n+1} a_k,$$

and, for a general lower index $m$ with $m \le n + 1$, writing $d = n + 1 - m$
for the number of terms,

$$\sum_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \sum_{j < d} a_{m+j}, \qquad \prod_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \prod_{j < d} a_{m+j} .$$

When $m = n + 1$ we have $d = 0$ and the sum is **empty**, with value $0$, while
the empty product has value $1$. In the same spirit $\sum_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ is
notation for the empty sum $\Sigma_0 = 0$ and $\prod_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ for the
empty product $\Pi_0 = 1$; the index $-1$ never occurs as an element of
$\mathbb{N}$ and is only a way of writing "no terms".

Only finitely many values of $a$ enter $\sum_{k<n} a_k$, so the notation
$\sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\prod_{k<n} a_k$ is also used for a list
$a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$ of reals given without reference to any extension of the
list to all of $\mathbb{N}$: extend the list by $a_k = 0$ (respectively
$a_k = 1$) for $k \ge n$ and apply the definition above.

## Remarks

- **Why recursion and not "$a_0 + a_1 + \cdots + a_{n-1}$".** The dots are not a
  definition: they presuppose that the displayed pattern determines a value for
  every $n$, which is exactly what the recursion theorem
  ([[thm-recursion]]) supplies, and its uniqueness clause is what makes
  $\sum_{k<n} a_k$ a single well-determined real rather than a family of choices.
  Associativity and commutativity of addition are *not* used in the definition;
  they are used in the laws proved from it ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).
- **Naturals and rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$ (a convention used on the whole
  page).** A natural number $n$ and a rational number $r$ are not literally
  elements of $\mathbb{R}$: they enter $\mathbb{R}$ through the canonical
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$, which is an injective,
  order-preserving field homomorphism ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), restricting on
  positive naturals to $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} = 1_\mathbb{R} + \cdots + 1_\mathbb{R}$
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). Following ordinary practice, and only where no
  confusion is possible, we write $n$ for $\iota(n)$ and $r$ for $\iota(r)$; so,
  for instance, $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k<n} a_k$ means
  $\iota(n)^{-1} \cdot \sum_{k<n} a_k$, which makes sense because
  $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$. Exponents are the one place where the
  identification is deliberately NOT made: in $a^n$ and $a^r$ the exponent stays
  a natural, an integer or a rational ([[def-integer-power]],
  [[def-rational-power]]), never a real.
- The two indexings are related by $\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k = \sum_{k < n+1} a_k$, so
  a statement proved for one is available for the other. Sums over $k < n$ are
  the primitive form here because $\Sigma_0$, the empty sum, is then the base
  case of every induction, and no index outside $\mathbb{N}$ is ever needed.

## Definition

Let $a \in \mathbb{R}$, where $\mathbb{R}$ is the ambient ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]).

**Natural exponents.** By the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) applied to
the set $\mathbb{R}$, the starting element $1$ and the function
$f(x) = x \cdot a$, there is a unique function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$,
written $n \mapsto a^n$, with

$$a^0 = 1, \qquad a^{n+1} = a^n \cdot a \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Thus $a^1 = a$, $a^2 = a \cdot a$, and so on. Note that this is defined for
**every** $a$, including $a = 0$.

**Negative exponents.** If $a \ne 0$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, set

$$a^{-n} := (a^n)^{-1}.$$

**Why that is legitimate.** The right-hand side presupposes that $a^n$ is
invertible, that is, that $a^n \ne 0$. This is a proof obligation and not an
observation, and it is discharged by claim 2 of [[lem-power-laws]]: for $a \ne 0$
in a field, $a^n \ne 0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, proved there by induction on
$n$ from the fact that a field has no zero divisors ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]).
That lemma is a statement *about* the operation introduced here, so it depends on
this definition and is recorded in this item's `justified_by` rather than in its
`deps` (SCHEMA §3). Given $a^n \ne 0$, the value $(a^n)^{-1}$ is a single
well-determined element, because multiplicative inverses in a field are unique
([[lem-of-inverse-unique]]).

**Integer exponents.** Every integer $m$ ([[def-integers]]) is either
$\iota(n)$ or $-\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$, where $\iota$ is the
embedding $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]],
[[def-int-operations]]). This too is a citation and not a slogan: the order on
$\mathbb{Z}$ is total ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), so $m \ge 0$ or $m < 0$; the
image of $\iota$ is exactly the set of nonnegative integers, and each of them is
$\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]); and if $m < 0$ then
$-m > 0$, by compatibility of the order with addition ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]),
so $-m = \iota(n)$ and $m = -\iota(n)$, with $n$ unique because $\iota$ is
injective. The two clauses above therefore define $a^m$ for every
$m \in \mathbb{Z}$ whenever $a \ne 0$, and for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$ for
arbitrary $a$. The clauses are consistent where they overlap: the only overlap is
$m = 0$, where $-\iota(0) = \iota(0)$ and $(a^0)^{-1} = 1^{-1} = 1 = a^0$.

## Remarks

- **The convention $0^0 = 1$ is adopted here**, and it is not a matter of taste
  but of agreement with the recursion above: $a^0 = 1$ is the starting value for
  every $a$, exactly as the empty product is $1$ ([[def-finite-sum]]). This is
  the convention that makes the empty product, the binomial theorem, and
  polynomial notation $\sum_k c_k x^k$ work at $x = 0$ without an exception. The
  competing convention "$0^0$ undefined" belongs to contexts where $x^y$ is
  studied as a function of two *real* variables and one wants continuity, which
  is unavailable and irrelevant here: the exponent in $a^m$ is an integer, never
  a real.
- $0^n = 0$ for every $n \ge 1$, since $0^{n} = 0^{n-1} \cdot 0 = 0$, a product
  with a zero factor ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]); and
  $0^{-n}$ is not defined for $n \ge 1$, since $0$ has no inverse.
- The exponent is an integer and stays an integer. Rational exponents are a
  separate construction resting on the existence of roots
  ([[thm-nth-roots-exist]], [[def-rational-power]]), and real exponents do not
  exist in this library yet ([[rem-real-exponents-deferred]]).
- The laws $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$ are
  proved, not assumed, in [[lem-power-laws]]; the order behaviour of $a \mapsto a^n$
  is [[lem-power-monotone]].

## Definition

A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals **converges** to $x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for
every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with
$|x_k - x| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$. It is **Cauchy** when for
every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with
$|x_k - x_l| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$.

## Remarks

- Quantifying over rational $\varepsilon$ loses nothing: below any real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ lies a positive rational ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).
- $|\cdot|$ is the absolute value of [[def-real-order]].

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-real-numbers]]) and
a **sequence of reals** is a function $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$
([[def-sequence]]), written $(a_k)$; recall that $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$.

**Partial sums.** Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals. Its **sequence of partial
sums** is

$$s_n \;:=\; \sum_{k < n} a_k \qquad (n \in \mathbb{N}),$$

the finite sum of [[def-finite-sum]]. In particular $s_0 = 0$, the empty sum, and
$s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ for every $n$, those being exactly the two recursion clauses
that define the finite sum. Note that $s_n$ is the sum of the $n$ terms
$a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$, so the index $n$ counts terms rather than naming the last
one.

**Convergence, the sum, divergence.** The **series** of $(a_k)$, written
$\sum a_k$, **converges** when the sequence $(s_n)$ of partial sums converges
([[def-real-limit]]), and then the **sum of the series** is

$$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k \;:=\; \lim_{n} s_n .$$

The series **diverges** when $(s_n)$ does not converge. A convergent sequence of
reals has exactly one limit ([[lem-limit-unique]]), so the displayed symbol names
a single real number and nothing further has to be checked for it to be
well defined.

**Series with a general starting index.** Let $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $a$ be a
function on $\{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : k \ge m \,\}$, which we call a **family from
$m$** and write $(a_k)_{k \ge m}$. The series

$$\sum_{k \ge m} a_k$$

is by definition the series of the sequence $b_j := a_{j + m}$,
$j \in \mathbb{N}$, which is a genuine sequence of reals; it converges exactly
when that series converges, and its sum is then written
$\sum_{k = m}^{\infty} a_k$. Its partial sums are

$$\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k \;=\; \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j} \qquad (n \ge m),$$

in the notation of [[def-finite-sum]], the value at $n = m$ being the empty sum
$0$. A sequence on $\mathbb{N}$ is the case $m = 0$, and the two readings of
$\sum a_k$ agree there, since $b_j = a_j$.

**This clause is not a convenience.** Sequences in this library are functions on
$\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$ ([[def-sequence]]), while many of the
classical series are built from expressions that are undefined at the index $0$:
$1/k$, $1/k^{p}$ and $|a_k|^{1/k}$ all require $k \ge 1$. Writing such a series as
$\sum_{k \ge 1} a_k$ names an honest object, whereas writing it as a sequence on
$\mathbb{N}$ would require a value at an index where the defining expression has
none. Every statement on this page says which starting index it uses.

**Tail series.** For $N \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$N$-th tail series** of
$\sum a_k$ is $\sum_{k \ge N} a_k$, that is the series of the $N$-th tail
$a^{(N)}$ of [[def-sequence]], whose terms are $a^{(N)}_j = a_{j+N}$. The
$0$-th tail series is the series itself.

## Remarks

- **"Diverges" here means "does not converge", and nothing more.** A divergent
  series may have partial sums that run away to $+\infty$, or to $-\infty$, or
  that oscillate without settling anywhere. The three behaviours are not
  distinguished by the word, and no statement on this page uses "diverges" to
  mean "the partial sums are unbounded" unless it says so.

- **The symbol $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k$ is defined only for a convergent
  series.** It denotes a real number, not a formal object, and it is illegitimate
  to write it down before convergence has been established. Where a proof needs
  to speak of the series without knowing whether it converges, it speaks of
  $(a_k)$ and of $(s_n)$.

- **Two indices, doing different work.** The index $k$ runs over the terms and is
  bound; the index $n$ runs over the partial sums and is the variable in which the
  limit is taken. Confusing them is the commonest slip in the subject, and it is
  the reason the definition above fixes $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ rather than
  $\sum_{k \le n} a_k$: with this choice the recursion $s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ is
  the one supplied by [[def-finite-sum]], with no shift anywhere.

## Statement

Let $r \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $r^k$ be the integer power ([[def-integer-power]]).

1. If $|r| < 1$ then $(r^k)$ is **null**, that is $r^k \to 0$
   ([[def-real-limit]]).
2. If $|r| > 1$ then $(|r|^k)$ **diverges to $+\infty$**
   ([[def-divergence-to-infinity]]).

Claim 2 is stated for $|r|^k$ and not for $r^k$ on purpose: for $r < -1$ the
terms $r^k$ alternate in sign and are unbounded, so they neither converge nor
diverge to $+\infty$; what is true of them is the statement about their absolute
values.

Both claims come from Bernoulli's inequality ([[lem-bernoulli-inequality]]) and
the Archimedean property. Nothing here needs the least-upper-bound property
except through [[thm-of-archimedean]] and [[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real $r$, with integer powers as in [[def-integer-power]]; for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the symbol $n$ also denotes the canonical natural $n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ where it occurs in an arithmetic expression.

[L1] Absolute value: $|x| \ge 0$; $|x| = 0$ exactly when $x = 0$; $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; and $|x| = x$ when $x \ge 0$, so in particular $|1| = 1$ because $1 > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]], [[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] Induction principle ([[thm-induction-principle]]), and the recursion clauses $a^0 = 1$, $a^{k+1} = a^k a$ defining integer powers ([[def-integer-power]]).

[L3] Bernoulli's inequality: $(1+x)^n \ge 1 + nx$ for $x \ge -1$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[lem-bernoulli-inequality]]).

[L4] Power laws: $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$, and $a^n \ne 0$ when $a \ne 0$ ([[lem-power-laws]]).

[L5] Powers and order: $a \ge 0$ gives $a^n \ge 0$ and $a > 0$ gives $a^n > 0$; $1^n = 1$ for every $n$ ([[lem-power-monotone]]).

[L6] Reciprocals: $a > 0$ gives $a^{-1} > 0$; $0 < a < b$ gives $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]); and $0 < t < 1$ exactly when $1/t > 1$ ([[prop-of-reciprocal-order]]).

[L7] Archimedean property: for every $x \in \mathbb{R}$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $x < n$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); and for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/N < \varepsilon$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]]).

[L8] Canonical naturals: $n > 0$ for $n \ge 1$, and $m \le n$ in $\mathbb{N}$ gives $m \le n$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L9] Multiplying inequalities of nonnegatives: $0 \le a \le b$ and $0 \le c \le d$ give $ac \le bd$ ([[prop-of-multiply-inequalities]]).

[L10] Trichotomy of the order on $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L11] Convergence to $0$ and divergence to $+\infty$ for a sequence of reals; a rational test value $\varepsilon > 0$ is in particular a real one ([[def-real-limit]], [[def-divergence-to-infinity]], [[def-sequence]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 First, $|r^k| = |r|^k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, by induction: at $k = 0$ both sides are $|1| = 1$, and if $|r^k| = |r|^k$ then $|r^{k+1}| = |r^k r| = |r^k|\,|r| = |r|^k |r| = |r|^{k+1}$. [given, L1, L2]

1.2 **Case zero.** Assume $r = 0$. [given, assume-case zero]

1.3 **Case small.** Assume $0 < |r| < 1$. [given, assume-case small]

1.4 **Case large.** Assume $|r| > 1$. [given, assume-case large]

2.1 In case zero, $r^k = 0$ for every $k \ge 1$: indeed $r^1 = r^0 r = 1 \cdot 0 = 0$, and if $r^k = 0$ then $r^{k+1} = r^k r = 0$, so induction gives the claim from $k = 1$ on. [step 1.2, L2]

2.2 In case small, put $s := 1/|r|$, which is defined since $|r| \ne 0$, and $h := s - 1$. Then $s > 1$ and $h > 0$. [step 1.3, L1, L6, choose]

2.3 In case large, put $h' := |r| - 1$, so $h' > 0$ and $|r| = 1 + h'$. [step 1.4, choose]

3.1 In case zero, for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ and every $k \ge 1$ we have $|r^k - 0| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$, so $r^k \to 0$ and claim 1 holds. [step 2.1, L1, L11]

3.2 In case small, $|r|^k s^k = (|r| s)^k = 1^k = 1$, so $|r|^k = 1/s^k$, and $s^k > 0$. [step 2.2, L4, L5]

3.3 In case small, Bernoulli applied to $h > 0 \ge -1$ gives $s^k = (1+h)^k \ge 1 + kh > kh > 0$ for every $k \ge 1$, using $1 > 0$ and $kh > 0$. [step 2.2, L3, L8, L9]

3.4 In case large, Bernoulli applied to $h' > 0 \ge -1$ gives $|r|^k = (1 + h')^k \ge 1 + k h'$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.3, L3]

3.5 In case large, let $M \in \mathbb{R}$ be arbitrary and use [L7] to fix a natural $n \ge 1$ with $M/h' < n$; then $M \le n h'$, since multiplying $M/h' \le n$ by $h' > 0$ preserves the inequality. [step 2.3, L7, L9, choose]

3.6 In case small, let $\varepsilon > 0$ be rational; then $\varepsilon h > 0$, so [L7] supplies a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/N < \varepsilon h$, whence $1/(Nh) \le \varepsilon$ on multiplying by $1/h > 0$. [step 2.2, L6, L7, L9, choose]

4.1 In case small, combining steps 3.2 and 3.3: $0 < kh < s^k$ gives $|r|^k = 1/s^k < 1/(kh)$ for every $k \ge 1$. [step 3.2, step 3.3, L6]

4.2 In case large, for every $k \ge n$ we have $k h' \ge n h' \ge M$, so $|r|^k \ge 1 + k h' \ge 1 + M > M$, the last step because $1 > 0$. [step 3.4, step 3.5, L1, L8, L9]

5.1 In case small, for every $k \ge N$ we have $kh \ge Nh > 0$, hence $1/(kh) \le 1/(Nh) \le \varepsilon$, and therefore $|r^k - 0| = |r^k| = |r|^k < 1/(kh) \le \varepsilon$. [step 1.1, step 4.1, step 3.6, L6, L8, L9]

5.2 In case large, an index $n$ has been produced for an arbitrary real $M$ with $|r|^k > M$ for all $k \ge n$, which is exactly divergence to $+\infty$: claim 2 holds. [step 4.2, L11]

6.1 In case small, the rational $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary and the index $N$ was produced from it, so $r^k \to 0$ and claim 1 holds. [step 5.1, L11]

7.1 The hypothesis $|r| < 1$ of claim 1 is exhausted by cases zero and small, since $|r| \ge 0$ with $|r| = 0$ exactly when $r = 0$, so trichotomy leaves only $0 < |r| < 1$; the hypothesis $|r| > 1$ of claim 2 is case large. Both claims are therefore established. [step 3.1, step 5.2, step 6.1, L1, L10, cases: zero small or large, cases-exhaustive] ∎

## Remarks

- **The two claims are not one claim in disguise.** For $|r| > 1$ the sequence
  $(r^k)$ itself has no limiting behaviour to record when $r$ is negative: its
  terms alternate in sign and grow, so it neither converges nor diverges to
  $+\infty$ nor to $-\infty$. Stating claim 2 for $|r|^k$ is what makes it true
  as written.

- **The boundary $|r| = 1$ is excluded and is genuinely different.** For $r = 1$
  the sequence is constant $1$; for $r = -1$ it is the alternating sequence
  ([[lem-alternating-sequence]]), which is bounded and divergent
  ([[fs-bounded-implies-convergent]]). So neither claim extends to $|r| = 1$, and
  the two cases at the boundary do not even agree with each other.

- **Where this is used.** Claim 1 supplies the null sequence $c^{k}$ that makes a
  contractive sequence Cauchy ([[thm-contractive-implies-cauchy]]) and the null
  sequence $(1/10)^n$ that identifies the limit of the decimal truncations of
  $\sqrt 2$ ([[cex-cauchy-rationals-no-rational-limit]]).

## Statement

Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals. If the series $\sum a_k$ converges
([[def-series]]) then the sequence $(a_k)$ converges ([[def-real-limit]]), with

$$\lim_{k} a_k \;=\; 0 .$$

Equivalently, in the contrapositive form in which the lemma is almost always
used: **if $(a_k)$ does not converge to $0$ then $\sum a_k$ diverges.**

The same statement holds for a series $\sum_{k \ge m} a_k$ with a general
starting index, with the conclusion that $(a_{j+m})_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges
to $0$: that series is by definition the series of the sequence
$b_j = a_{j+m}$ ([[def-series]]), so it is the statement above applied to $(b_j)$.

The converse is false; it is refuted by [[fs-nth-term-test-converse]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(a_k)$ of reals whose series converges, with partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[A1] $(s_n)$ converges to some real $S$ ([[def-series]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L1] The recursion clause of the finite sum: $s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[def-series]]).

[L2] Convergence depends only on the tail: if $(x_n)$ converges to $x$ then so does its $1$-st tail $(x_{n+1})_{n}$ ([[lem-limit-of-tail]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L3] Algebra of limits: if $x_n \to x$ and $y_n \to y$ then $x_n - y_n \to x - y$ ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The sequence $(s_{n+1})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is the $1$-st tail of $(s_n)$, and it converges to $S$. [A1, L2]

1.2 From the recursion clause, $a_n = s_{n+1} - s_n$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. [L1, algebra]

2.1 Hence $(a_n)$ is the difference of two sequences converging to $S$, so it converges to $S - S = 0$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, A1, L3]

3.1 That is the claim, and its contrapositive is the assertion that a series whose terms do not tend to $0$ diverges. [step 2.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **This is a necessary condition and never a sufficient one.** It rules a series out; it never rules one in. The harmonic series has terms tending to $0$ and diverges, which is exactly the content of [[fs-nth-term-test-converse]].

- **What the proof actually uses.** Only that the partial sums converge and that consecutive partial sums differ by a term. No sign hypothesis is placed on $(a_k)$, and none is available at this point on the page.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$, with
$|x|$ the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]). Then

$$|x| \ge 0; \quad |x| = 0 \iff x = 0; \quad -|x| \le x \le |x|; \quad |-x| = |x|; \quad |xy| = |x|\,|y|;$$

and, for every $c > 0$, one has $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and elements $x, y \in F$.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| = u$ if $u \ge 0$, and $|u| = -u$ if $u < 0$ ([[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Ordered-field order: trichotomy holds (for each $u$ exactly one of $u > 0$, $u = 0$, $u < 0$), $a < b$ means $b - a$ is positive, and sums and products of positives are positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Signs in products: $(-a)b = -(ab)$ and $(-a)(-b) = ab$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] Sign rules: a product of two elements of the same sign is positive, and a product of two elements of opposite sign is negative ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Case $x > 0$: by [L1] $|x| = x > 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; since $-x < 0$ we get $|-x| = -(-x) = x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -x < 0 < x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case pos, L1, L2, algebra]

1.2 Case $x = 0$: then $|x| = |0| = 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ holds with $|x| = 0$ and $x = 0$, while $|-x| = |0| = |x|$ and $-|x| = 0 \le 0 \le 0 = |x|$. [assume-case zero, L1]

1.3 Case $x < 0$: by [L1] $|x| = -x$, and [L2] gives $-x > 0$, so $|x| > 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; here $|-x| = -x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -(-x) = x \le x$ while $x < 0 < -x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case neg, L1, L2, algebra]

1.4 Case $x = 0$ or $y = 0$: then $xy = 0$, so $|xy| = 0$, and one of $|x|, |y|$ is $0$, whence $|x|\,|y| = 0 = |xy|$. [assume-case zerofactor, L1]

1.5 Case $x, y$ have the same sign (both positive or both negative): by [L4] $xy > 0$, so $|xy| = xy$, while $|x|\,|y| = xy$ by [L3] (for $x, y < 0$ this is $(-x)(-y) = xy$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case same, L1, L3, L4]

1.6 Case $x, y$ have opposite signs (one positive, one negative): by [L4] $xy < 0$, so $|xy| = -(xy)$, while $|x|\,|y| = -(xy)$ by [L3] (namely $x(-y)$ or $(-x)y$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case opposite, L1, L3, L4]

2.1 By trichotomy [L2] each $x$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.1-1.3, and in each we verified $|x| \ge 0$, that $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$, that $|-x| = |x|$, and that $-|x| \le x \le |x|$; hence all four hold for every $x$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, cases-exhaustive]

2.2 By trichotomy [L2] each pair $x, y$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.4-1.6, and in each $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$ for all $x, y$. [step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6, cases-exhaustive]

3.1 Let $c > 0$: if $|x| < c$ then $-c < -|x| \le x \le |x| < c$ by [step 2.1] and [L2], so $-c < x < c$; conversely if $-c < x < c$ then both $x < c$ and $-x < c$, and since $|x|$ equals $x$ or $-x$ by [L1], we get $|x| < c$, so $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$. [step 2.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Statement

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, with powers
as in [[def-integer-power]] and finite sums as in [[def-finite-sum]]. Then

$$b^n - a^n = (b - a)\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a^k b^{\,n-1-k}.$$

**Lipschitz estimate.** If $0 \le a \le b \le M$ then

$$0 \le b^n - a^n \le n M^{\,n-1} (b - a),$$

where $n$ denotes the canonical natural $\iota(n) \in \mathbb{R}$
([[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[lem-of-q-embeds]]). This estimate is the form in
which the factorisation is used, later on this page, to prove that $n$-th roots
exist.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Elements $a, b, M$ of $\mathbb{R}$ and a natural $n \ge 1$. Define $c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ by $c_k = a^k b^{\,n-k}$ for $k \le n$ and $c_k = a^n$ for $k > n$; only the values $c_0, \dots, c_n$ occur below.

[L1] Definition of powers ([[def-integer-power]]): $a^0 = 1$ and $a^{j+1} = a^j a$.

[L2] Laws of finite sums ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], themselves proved by induction, [[thm-induction-principle]]): telescoping $\sum_{k<n}(c_{k+1} - c_k) = c_n - c_0$; scaling $\sum_{k<n}\lambda d_k = \lambda \sum_{k<n} d_k$ and the constant sum $\sum_{k<n}\lambda = n\lambda$; and monotonicity, $d_k \le e_k$ for all $k < n$ implies $\sum_{k<n} d_k \le \sum_{k<n} e_k$.

[L3] Laws of integer exponents ([[lem-power-laws]]): $M^{k} M^{\,n-1-k} = M^{\,n-1}$ for $k \le n-1$.

[L4] Monotonicity of powers ([[lem-power-monotone]]): $0 \le x \le y$ implies $0 \le x^j \le y^j$.

[L5] Multiplying inequalities of nonnegatives: $0 \le x \le y$ and $0 \le u \le v$ imply $xu \le yv$. [[prop-of-multiply-inequalities]] states exactly this nonstrict form, alongside the strict one, and it is the only product-of-inequalities move used below. Two instances occur: in step 1.3 with the four nonnegatives $a^k \le M^k$ and $b^{\,n-1-k} \le M^{\,n-1-k}$, and in step 4.1 with $0 \le \sum_{k<n} a^k b^{\,n-1-k} \le nM^{\,n-1}$ and $0 \le b - a \le b - a$, which yields $\big(\sum_{k<n} a^k b^{\,n-1-k}\big)(b-a) \le nM^{\,n-1}(b-a)$. No instance with a possibly negative factor and no strict instance is needed, so the multiplicative order claims of [[lem-of-sign-rules]], which are strict and require a nonzero multiplier, are not what carries either move.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The consecutive differences of $c$ factor: for $k < n$, $c_{k+1} - c_k = a^{k+1} b^{\,n-k-1} - a^k b^{\,n-k} = a^k b^{\,n-1-k}\,a - a^k b^{\,n-1-k}\,b = a^k b^{\,n-1-k}(a - b)$, using $a^{k+1} = a^k a$ and $b^{\,n-k} = b^{\,n-1-k} b$. [L1, algebra]

1.2 The endpoints of $c$ are $c_0 = a^0 b^{\,n} = b^n$ and $c_n = a^n b^{\,0} = a^n$. [L1, algebra]

1.3 Now assume $0 \le a \le b \le M$; then for every $k < n$, $0 \le a^k \le M^k$ and $0 \le b^{\,n-1-k} \le M^{\,n-1-k}$, so $0 \le a^k b^{\,n-1-k} \le M^k M^{\,n-1-k} = M^{\,n-1}$. [L3, L4, L5]

1.4 Also $b - a \ge 0$ and $M^{\,n-1} \ge 0$, and $b^n - a^n \ge 0$ because $0 \le a \le b$ gives $a^n \le b^n$. [L4, L5]

2.1 Telescoping the differences: $\sum_{k<n}(c_{k+1} - c_k) = c_n - c_0 = a^n - b^n$. [step 1.2, L2]

2.2 Pulling the constant factor out of the same sum: $\sum_{k<n}(c_{k+1} - c_k) = \sum_{k<n} a^k b^{\,n-1-k}(a-b) = (a-b)\sum_{k<n} a^k b^{\,n-1-k}$. [step 1.1, L2]

2.3 Summing the bound of step 1.3 over $k < n$ and using monotonicity and the constant sum: $\sum_{k<n} a^k b^{\,n-1-k} \le \sum_{k<n} M^{\,n-1} = n M^{\,n-1}$. [step 1.3, L2]

3.1 Comparing the two evaluations gives $a^n - b^n = (a - b)\sum_{k<n} a^k b^{\,n-1-k}$, and multiplying both sides by $-1$ gives the stated factorisation $b^n - a^n = (b-a)\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a^k b^{\,n-1-k}$. [step 2.1, step 2.2, algebra]

4.1 Multiplying the inequality of step 2.3 by the nonnegative factor $b - a$ and substituting into the factorisation gives $b^n - a^n = (b-a)\sum_{k<n} a^k b^{\,n-1-k} \le n M^{\,n-1}(b-a)$; the multiplication is the instance of [L5] with $0 \le \sum_{k<n} a^k b^{\,n-1-k} \le nM^{\,n-1}$ and $0 \le b-a \le b-a$, the left-hand nonnegativity holding because every term is nonnegative by step 1.3 and finite sums are monotone. Together with $b^n - a^n \ge 0$ this is the Lipschitz estimate. [step 3.1, step 1.3, step 1.4, step 2.3, L2, L5] ∎

## Statement

Let $\mathbb{R}$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]), let
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $n \in \mathbb{N}$, with powers as in
[[def-integer-power]].

1. **Signs.** If $a \ge 0$ then $a^n \ge 0$, and if $a > 0$ then $a^n > 0$.
2. **Strict monotonicity in the base.** If $0 \le a < b$ and $n \ge 1$ then $a^n < b^n$. Consequently, for $a, b \ge 0$ and $n \ge 1$: $a < b \iff a^n < b^n$ and $a \le b \iff a^n \le b^n$, and $x \mapsto x^n$ is injective on $\{x \in \mathbb{R} : x \ge 0\}$.
3. **Comparison with the base.** If $a \ge 1$ and $n \ge 1$ then $a^n \ge a \ge 1$; if $a > 1$ and $n \ge 1$ then $a^n \ge a > 1$; and if $0 \le a \le 1$ then $a^n \le 1$.
4. **Monotonicity in the exponent.** If $a > 1$ then $a^m < a^n$ whenever $m < n$ in $\mathbb{N}$; if $a = 1$ then $a^n = 1$ for all $n$; and if $0 < a < 1$ then $a^m > a^n$ whenever $m < n$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $\mathbb{R}$, elements $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and naturals $m, n$.

[L1] Definition of powers ([[def-integer-power]]): $a^0 = 1$ and $a^{n+1} = a^n a$.

[L2] Induction principle ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L3] Sign and scaling rules: a product of positives is positive, and for $c > 0$, $x < y \iff cx < cy$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]); the positives are closed under addition and satisfy trichotomy ([[def-ordered-field]]); and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]], which is where that fact is proved: neither of the two items just named states it).

[L4] Multiplying inequalities of nonnegatives: if $0 \le x \le y$ and $0 \le u \le v$ then $xu \le yv$, and if $0 < x < y$ and $0 < u < v$ then $xu < yv$ ([[prop-of-multiply-inequalities]]).

[L5] Trichotomy and transitivity of the order: for $x, y$ exactly one of $x < y$, $x = y$, $y < x$ holds, and $<$ and $\le$ are transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L6] The order on the exponents: $m \le n$ holds exactly when $n = m + k$ for some natural $k$ ([[def-nat-order]]), and $m < n$ holds exactly when $m + 1 \le n$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]); combining the two, $m < n$ holds exactly when $n = m + d$ for some natural $d \ge 1$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 0$: $a^0 = 1 > 0$, so claim 1 holds; claim 2 is vacuous at $n = 0$; $a^0 = 1 \ge 1$ and $a^0 = 1 \le 1$, so claim 3 holds at $n = 0$ in the nonstrict readings. [base, L1, L3]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume, for all $a, b$: $a \ge 0 \Rightarrow a^n \ge 0$ and $a > 0 \Rightarrow a^n > 0$; and $0 \le a \le b \Rightarrow a^n \le b^n$, with $a^n < b^n$ when moreover $a < b$ and $n \ge 1$. [ih]

2.1 Signs at $n+1$: if $a \ge 0$ then $a^{n+1} = a^n a$ is a product of two nonnegatives, hence $\ge 0$, and if $a > 0$ it is a product of two positives, hence $> 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L3, L4]

3.1 Strict monotonicity at $n+1$, assuming $0 \le a < b$: then $b > 0$, and the hypothesis gives $0 \le a^n \le b^n$ with $b^n > 0$ by step 2.1; if $a = 0$ then $a^{n+1} = 0 < b^{n+1}$ since $b^{n+1} = b^n b > 0$; if $a > 0$ then $a^{n+1} = a^n a \le b^n a$ by multiplying $a^n \le b^n$ by $a > 0$, and $b^n a < b^n b$ by multiplying $a < b$ by $b^n > 0$, so $a^{n+1} < b^{n+1}$ by transitivity; and in either case $0 \le a \le b$ gives $a^{n+1} \le b^{n+1}$ by [L4]. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L1, L3, L4, L5]

4.1 By the induction principle, claims 1 and 2 hold for every $n$, in the form: $a \ge 0 \Rightarrow a^n \ge 0$; $a > 0 \Rightarrow a^n > 0$; and $0 \le a < b$ with $n \ge 1$ gives $a^n < b^n$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 3.1, L2]

5.1 The equivalences of claim 2 follow by trichotomy: for $a, b \ge 0$ and $n \ge 1$, if $a^n < b^n$ then neither $a = b$ (which would give $a^n = b^n$) nor $b < a$ (which would give $b^n < a^n$) is possible, so $a < b$; the $\le$ form is the negation of the $<$ form with $a$ and $b$ exchanged; and injectivity is the case $a^n = b^n$, where $a < b$ and $b < a$ are both excluded. [step 4.1, L5]

5.2 Claim 4: for $a > 1$ we have $a^{n+1} = a^n a > a^n \cdot 1 = a^n$, multiplying $1 < a$ by $a^n > 0$, so $a^n$ is strictly increasing in $n$, and hence $a^m < a^n$ whenever $m < n$: writing $n = m + d$ with $d \ge 1$ and inducting on $d$, the case $d = 1$ is that one-step inequality and the passage from $d$ to $d+1$ is $a^m < a^{m+d} < a^{m+d+1}$ by transitivity; for $a = 1$ an induction gives $1^n = 1$ for all $n$; and for $0 < a < 1$ we have $a^{n+1} = a^n a < a^n \cdot 1 = a^n$, so $a^n$ is strictly decreasing in $n$ and the same induction on the gap $d$ gives $a^m > a^n$ for $m < n$. [step 4.1, L1, L2, L3, L5, L6]

6.1 Claim 3: if $a \ge 1$ and $n \ge 1$ then applying step 4.1 to $1 \le a$ gives $1 = 1^n \le a^n$, and $a^n = a^{n-1} a \ge 1 \cdot a = a$ since $a^{n-1} \ge 1$ by the same argument and $a > 0$; if $a > 1$ the same computation gives $a^n \ge a > 1$; and if $0 \le a \le 1$ then $a^n \le 1^n = 1$. [step 4.1, step 5.1, L1, L3, L4]

7.1 All four claims are proved: signs and strict monotonicity in the base by the induction of steps 1.1 and 3.1, the order equivalences and injectivity by trichotomy, and the comparisons with the base and the behaviour in the exponent by steps 6.1 and 5.2. [step 4.1, step 5.1, step 6.1, step 5.2, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ be sequences of reals ([[def-sequence]]) converging to
$x$ and $y$ respectively ([[def-real-limit]]), and let $c \in \mathbb{R}$. Then

$$x_k + y_k \to x + y, \qquad c\,x_k \to c\,x, \qquad x_k - y_k \to x - y, \qquad x_k y_k \to x y,$$

and if in addition $y \ne 0$ and $y_k \ne 0$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, then

$$\frac{1}{y_k} \to \frac{1}{y} \qquad \text{and} \qquad \frac{x_k}{y_k} \to \frac{x}{y}.$$

The quotient case rests on an eventual lower bound for $|y_k|$, proved below
rather than assumed: $|y_k| > |y|/2$ for all sufficiently large $k$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $(x_k)$, $(y_k)$ of reals with $(x_k)$ converging to $x$ and $(y_k)$ converging to $y$, and a real $c$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]). For the last two claims we assume in addition $y \ne 0$ and $y_k \ne 0$ for every $k$.

[L1] Convergence, quantified over rational $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-real-limit]]).

[L2] Absolute value and the triangle inequality: $|uv| = |u|\,|v|$, $|u| \ge 0$, $|u| = 0$ if and only if $u = 0$, $|-u| = |u|$, and $|a + b| \le |a| + |b|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L3] Real versus rational $\varepsilon$: for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, by density ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) or by the Archimedean property ([[thm-of-archimedean]]) applied to $1/\eta$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]); consequently the convergence test of [[def-real-limit]] may equivalently be run with real $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-sequence]]).

[L4] Convergent sequences are bounded ([[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]]), and a constant sequence $(c)$ is bounded by $|c|$ ([[def-sequence]]).

[L5] A null sequence times a bounded sequence is null ([[lem-null-times-bounded]]).

[L6] Reverse triangle inequality: $\bigl||u| - |v|\bigr| \le |u - v|$, hence $|u| \ge |v| - |v - u|$ ([[cor-of-reverse-triangle]]).

[L7] Inverses and order: $a > 0$ implies $a^{-1} > 0$; $0 < a < b$ implies $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$; $(u^{-1})^{-1} = u$ for $u \ne 0$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-field]]).

[L8] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: adding a constant and adding inequalities preserve the order, multiplying a strict inequality by a positive factor preserves it, and $\le$ and $<$ compose transitively; trichotomy holds, and since $u \ge 0$ means $u > 0$ or $u = 0$, an element with $u \ge 0$ and $u \ne 0$ satisfies $u > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]). Moreover $2 = 1 + 1 > 0$ and $2$ is invertible: $0 < 1$ in any ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]) and the positives are closed under addition, so $2 > 0$ and in particular $2 \ne 0$ ([[def-ordered-field]]), whence $2^{-1}$ exists ([[def-field]]).

[L9] Rational arithmetic: $\varepsilon/2$ is a rational $> 0$ whenever $\varepsilon$ is, and $\varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$ ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]); the order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total, so finitely many thresholds admit a common index ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Reduction to null sequences: for any sequence $(z_k)$ of reals and any real $z$, the statements "$(z_k)$ converges to $z$" and "$(z_k - z)$ converges to $0$" are literally the same condition, because $|(z_k - z) - 0| = |z_k - z|$ for every $k$. [L1, L2]

1.2 Sum rule, in general form. Let $(u_k) \to u$ and $(v_k) \to v$ be any convergent sequences of reals and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be rational; take $K_1$ with $|u_k - u| < \varepsilon/2$ for $k \ge K_1$ and $K_2$ with $|v_k - v| < \varepsilon/2$ for $k \ge K_2$, and let $K$ be an index at least as large as both. For $k \ge K$, $|(u_k + v_k) - (u + v)| = |(u_k - u) + (v_k - v)| \le |u_k - u| + |v_k - v| < \varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$; hence $u_k + v_k \to u + v$, and in particular $x_k + y_k \to x + y$. [L1, L2, L8, L9, algebra]

1.3 Boundedness: every convergent sequence of reals is bounded, and every constant sequence $(d)$ is bounded by $|d|$. [L4]

1.4 Quotient preparation. Assume $y \ne 0$ and $y_k \ne 0$ for every $k$. Then $|y| > 0$ by [L2], so $|y|/2 > 0$; running the convergence test of $(y_k)$ with the real number $|y|/2$ as tolerance, which [L3] licenses, produces $K_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|y_k - y| < |y|/2$ for all $k \ge K_0$. [L1, L2, L3, L7, L8, choose]

2.1 Scalar rule, in general form. Let $(u_k) \to u$ and let $d \in \mathbb{R}$. By step 1.1 the sequence $(u_k - u)$ is null and by step 1.3 the constant sequence $(d)$ is bounded, so $(d(u_k - u)) = (d u_k - d u)$ is null by [L5]; by step 1.1 again, $d u_k \to d u$, and in particular $c x_k \to c x$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, L5, algebra]

2.2 Product rule, in general form. Let $(u_k) \to u$ and $(v_k) \to v$, and write $u_k v_k - u v = u_k(v_k - v) + v(u_k - u)$. By step 1.1 both $(v_k - v)$ and $(u_k - u)$ are null; by step 1.3 both $(u_k)$ and the constant sequence $(v)$ are bounded; so both $(u_k(v_k - v))$ and $(v(u_k - u))$ are null by [L5], and their sum is null by step 1.2 applied with both limits equal to $0$. By step 1.1, $u_k v_k \to u v$, and in particular $x_k y_k \to x y$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, L5, algebra]

2.3 Eventual lower bound. For every $k \ge K_0$, the reverse triangle inequality gives $|y_k| \ge |y| - |y - y_k| = |y| - |y_k - y| > |y| - |y|/2 = |y|/2 > 0$; so $|y_k| > |y|/2$ for all $k \ge K_0$, and in particular $|y_k| \ne 0$ there. [step 1.4, L2, L6, L8]

3.1 Difference rule. Applying step 2.1 to the sequence $(y_k)$ with $d = -1$ gives $-y_k \to -y$; the sum rule of step 1.2 applied to $(x_k)$ and $(-y_k)$ then gives $x_k - y_k = x_k + (-y_k) \to x + (-y) = x - y$. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L8, algebra]

3.2 Reciprocal estimate. For $k \ge K_0$ we have $y_k \ne 0$ and $|y_k| > |y|/2 > 0$, so [L7] applied to $0 < |y|/2 < |y_k|$ gives $0 < |y_k|^{-1} < 2/|y|$, and therefore $\left|\dfrac{1}{y_k} - \dfrac{1}{y}\right| = \dfrac{|y - y_k|}{|y_k|\,|y|} \le \dfrac{2}{|y|^2}\,|y_k - y|$. [step 2.3, L2, L7, L8, algebra]

4.1 Reciprocal rule. Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real and put $\eta := \varepsilon |y|^2/2$, a real $> 0$; by [L3] there is $K_1$ with $|y_k - y| < \eta$ for all $k \ge K_1$. For every $k$ at least as large as both $K_0$ and $K_1$, step 3.2 gives $\left|\dfrac{1}{y_k} - \dfrac{1}{y}\right| \le \dfrac{2}{|y|^2}|y_k - y| < \dfrac{2}{|y|^2}\,\eta = \varepsilon$; hence $1/y_k \to 1/y$. [step 3.2, L1, L3, L7, L8, L9, algebra]

5.1 Quotient rule. By step 4.1 the sequence $(1/y_k)$ converges to $1/y$, so the product rule of step 2.2 applied to $(x_k)$ and $(1/y_k)$ gives $x_k/y_k = x_k \cdot (1/y_k) \to x \cdot (1/y) = x/y$. [step 2.2, step 4.1, algebra]

6.1 All the claims are established: the sum rule in step 1.2, the scalar rule in step 2.1, the difference rule in step 3.1, the product rule in step 2.2, and the reciprocal and quotient rules in steps 4.1 and 5.1. [step 1.2, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, step 4.1, step 5.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The quotient case is where proofs usually cheat.** The estimate $|1/y_k - 1/y| = |y - y_k| / (|y_k||y|)$ is worthless until $|y_k|$ is known to stay away from $0$: without a lower bound the denominator can be arbitrarily small and the fraction arbitrarily large, even while $|y - y_k|$ shrinks. Step 2.3 supplies that bound, $|y_k| > |y|/2$ for $k \ge K_0$, and it is proved from the reverse triangle inequality, not assumed.

- The hypothesis $y_k \ne 0$ for every $k$ is only there so that $1/y_k$ is defined for every index. It is not needed for the limit: step 2.3 shows $|y_k| > |y|/2 > 0$ from $K_0$ on, so a sequence with $y \ne 0$ has at most finitely many zero terms, and by [[lem-limit-of-tail]] one may pass to the $K_0$-th tail and read the conclusion there.

- The hypothesis $y \ne 0$ cannot be dropped. With $x_k = 1$ and $y_k = 1/(k+1)$, both sequences converge: the first is constant ([[def-sequence]]) and the second is null ([[fs-limit-preserves-strict-inequality]]), so $y = 0$. Yet $x_k/y_k = k+1$, and no real $M$ bounds every $k+1$, by the Archimedean property ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); so the quotient sequence is unbounded, hence not convergent by [[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]].

- Nothing in the proof uses completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ beyond the Archimedean property invoked in [L3], so the same rules hold verbatim for sequences of rationals.

## Statement

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. If $0 \in S$ and $\sigma(n) \in S$ whenever $n \in S$, then $S = \mathbb{N}$. Equivalently (property form): if a property $P$ satisfies $P(0)$ and ($P(n) \Rightarrow P(\sigma(n))$) for all $n$, then $P(n)$ holds for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. This is the induction principle, the basis of proof by induction.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $\mathbb{N} = \omega$ is the smallest inductive set ([[def-inductive-set]], [[def-natural-numbers]], [[lem-omega-smallest-inductive]]); $0 = \varnothing$, $\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$.

[L1] $\omega$ is contained in every inductive set ([[lem-omega-smallest-inductive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Suppose $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ with $0 = \varnothing \in S$ and ($x \in S \Rightarrow \sigma(x) = x \cup \{x\} \in S$). [given]

2.1 Then $S$ contains $\varnothing$ and is closed under $x \mapsto x \cup \{x\}$, so $S$ is an inductive set. [step 1.1]

3.1 $\mathbb{N} = \omega \subseteq S$ because $\omega$ is a subset of every inductive set. [L1, step 2.1]

4.1 With $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ by hypothesis, $S = \mathbb{N}$. [step 3.1, given]

5.1 The property form is the set case with $S = \{n \in \mathbb{N} : P(n)\}$: $P(0)$ and $P(n) \Rightarrow P(\sigma(n))$ give $0 \in S$ and $\sigma$-closure, so $S = \mathbb{N}$, i.e. $P$ holds for all $n$; conversely the set form is the property form applied to $P(n) :\equiv n \in S$, so the two are equivalent. [step 4.1] ∎
