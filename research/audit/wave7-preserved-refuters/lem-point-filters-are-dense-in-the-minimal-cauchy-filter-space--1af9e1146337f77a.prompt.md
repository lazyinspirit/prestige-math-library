You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as a
read-only adversarial proof-refuter for the published-page audit. You are
tool-less: you cannot open a file, run a command, browse, edit, or delegate.
Everything you may rely on is reproduced in the `This dispatch` section. Return
evidence only; Audit-Alpha alone adjudicates and edits.

## Triage — the standing rule (verbatim, binding on you)

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct
  citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

## Adversarial standard

Read the target's title, Statement/Definition/Example/Statement refuted, Facts &
Assumptions, every numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks.
Try to falsify the public claim and every load-bearing inference.

1. Compare every cited fact with the supplied source text before alleging that
   it is weak. Check domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, direction, conclusion,
   and whether the source licenses the exact use.
2. Check that the title and public statement assert no more than the proof
   establishes, and that every proof step uses only available premises.
3. Check both directions of biconditionals, uniqueness/existence claims,
   induction and limiting arguments, empty/zero/endpoint/degenerate cases,
   extended-real conventions, index shifts, and hidden division or choice.
4. Re-read Remarks as skeptically as a numbered step. A false mathematical
   remark is a defect even when the proof is sound.
5. When the target is marked `ai-generated`, actively search for a
   counterexample to its claim, witness, or refutation rather than merely
   checking prose consistency.
6. Treat a false public claim, logically invalid proof, missing necessary
   hypothesis, circularity, or materially inaccurate load-bearing citation as
   fatal. Do not inflate an expository omission or a gap closable within thirty
   seconds into a defect.

## Output format

Reply with exactly this structure and no preamble:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

If `DEFECTS`, give one block per finding:

```text
FINDING 1
  location: [exact title, section, fact label, or numbered step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [the exact mathematical assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, missing hypothesis, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]
```

Then always end with:

```text
BOUNDARY: [specific boundary/counterexample checks and their disposition]
SOURCES:  [confirm every supplied cited item used by the target was inspected]
CHECKED:  [confirm the title, public claim, every numbered step, and Remarks were read]

## Statement

The map $\eta:X\to\widehat X$ sending $x$ to the minimal Cauchy filter associated to its principal filter is uniformly continuous and has dense image. For every $x\in X$, every member of $\eta(x)$ contains $x$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A uniform space $X$ and its minimal-Cauchy-filter space $\widehat X$.

[L1] Principal filters are Cauchy and have associated minimal Cauchy filters ([[lem-minimal-cauchy-filter-associated-to-a-cauchy-filter]]).

[L2] The standard relations are entourages on $\widehat X$ ([[lem-entourages-on-minimal-cauchy-filters-form-a-separated-uniformity]]).

[L3] Entourage balls describe the induced topology and density is closure equal to the whole space ([[thm-uniformity-induces-a-topology]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

[L4] Symmetric entourages with prescribed finite-composite control may be chosen inside any entourage ([[lem-symmetric-entourages-form-a-base]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 Define $\eta(x)$ to be the minimal filter associated to the principal filter $\mathcal P_x$ at $x$. Since $\eta(x)=m(\mathcal P_x)\subseteq\mathcal P_x$, every member of $\eta(x)$ contains $x$. [L1, construct]

1.2 Let $\widehat E[\mathcal F]$ be a basic neighbourhood. Choose a symmetric $D$ with $D^{\circ2}\subseteq E$, a $D$-small $A\in\mathcal F$, and $a\in A$. The point filter $\eta(a)$ contains $D[a]$, and $D[a]\times A\subseteq D^{\circ2}\subseteq E$, so $\eta(a)\in\widehat E[\mathcal F]$. Thus every basic neighbourhood meets $\eta[X]$. [L1, L2, L3, L4, choose]

2.1 Given a target basic entourage $\widehat E$, choose a symmetric $D$ with $D^{\circ3}\subseteq E$. If $(x,y)\in D$, then $D[x]\in\eta(x)$ and $D[y]\in\eta(y)$, while $D[x]\times D[y]\subseteq D^{\circ3}\subseteq E$. Hence $(\eta(x),\eta(y))\in\widehat E$, which proves uniform continuity. [step 1.1, L2, L4]

3.1 Thus every neighbourhood meets $\eta[X]$, so its closure is all of $\widehat X$ and the image is dense. [step 1.2, L3, discharge-construct] ∎

## Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]), let
$A \subseteq X$ and let $x \in X$. Neighbourhoods are as in
[[def-neighbourhood-top]], so a neighbourhood need not be open.

- The **interior** of $A$ is
  $\operatorname{int}(A) := \bigcup \{\, U \in \mathcal{T} : U \subseteq A \,\}$.
- The **closure** of $A$ is
  $\overline{A} := \bigcap \{\, F \subseteq X : F \text{ closed and } A \subseteq F \,\}$.
- The **exterior** of $A$ is $\operatorname{ext}(A) := \operatorname{int}(X \setminus A)$.
- The **boundary** of $A$ is $\partial A := \overline{A} \setminus \operatorname{int}(A)$.
- $x$ is a **limit point** (accumulation point) of $A$ if every neighbourhood $N$
  of $x$ satisfies $N \cap (A \setminus \{x\}) \ne \varnothing$. The set of limit
  points of $A$ is the **derived set** $A'$.
- $x$ is an **isolated point of $A$** if $x \in A$ and some neighbourhood $N$ of
  $x$ satisfies $N \cap A = \{x\}$.

**Both operators are well posed, and the two names are justified rather than
asserted.** The interior is a union of open sets, hence open by (T2), it is
contained in $A$, and it contains every open $U \subseteq A$: so
$\operatorname{int}(A)$ is *the largest open subset of $A$*. The family being
intersected in the definition of $\overline{A}$ is nonempty, since $X$ is closed
and contains $A$, so the intersection is a set; it is closed by (C2) of
[[def-topological-space]], it contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed
$F \supseteq A$: so $\overline{A}$ is *the smallest closed superset of $A$*. In
particular

$$\operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq A \subseteq \overline{A},$$

and $A$ is open if and only if $A = \operatorname{int}(A)$, and closed if and
only if $A = \overline{A}$, in each case because one inclusion is automatic and
the other says exactly that $A$ belongs to the family in question.

**Interior and closure are exchanged by complementation.** For every
$A \subseteq X$,

$$X \setminus \operatorname{int}(A) = \overline{X \setminus A}, \qquad X \setminus \overline{A} = \operatorname{int}(X \setminus A) = \operatorname{ext}(A).$$

Indeed $U \mapsto X \setminus U$ is a bijection between the open subsets of $A$
and the closed supersets of $X \setminus A$, and it turns unions into
intersections ([[def-topological-space]]); applying complementation to the first
identity gives the second. So $\operatorname{ext}(A) = X \setminus \overline{A}$,
and every statement about interiors has a mirror statement about closures.

**The pointwise description of the interior.** $x \in \operatorname{int}(A)$ if
and only if $A$ is a neighbourhood of $x$. If $x \in \operatorname{int}(A)$ then
$\operatorname{int}(A)$ is an open set with $x \in \operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq A$;
conversely a neighbourhood relation $x \in U \subseteq A$ with $U$ open puts $x$
in the union defining $\operatorname{int}(A)$. The corresponding description of
the closure is proved as the next item, because it is the statement that does the
work in every later proof.

**$X$ is the disjoint union of the three regions.** Since
$\operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq \overline{A}$, the three sets
$\operatorname{int}(A)$, $\partial A = \overline{A} \setminus \operatorname{int}(A)$
and $\operatorname{ext}(A) = X \setminus \overline{A}$ are pairwise disjoint and
their union is $X$. This is recorded again, with the identities for interior and
closure of unions and intersections, in the lemma two items below.

## Remarks

- **The boundary is symmetric in $A$ and its complement**:
  $\partial A = \overline{A} \cap \overline{X \setminus A}$, because
  $\overline{A} \setminus \operatorname{int}(A) = \overline{A} \cap (X \setminus \operatorname{int}(A)) = \overline{A} \cap \overline{X \setminus A}$
  by the complementation identity above. Hence $\partial A = \partial(X \setminus A)$,
  and $\partial A$ is closed, being an intersection of two closed sets.

- **A limit point of $A$ need not lie in $A$, and a point of $A$ need not be a
  limit point of $A$.** The points of $A$ that are not limit points of $A$ are
  exactly its isolated points, directly from the two definitions. The relation
  $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$ is a theorem, proved next, not a restatement.

- **These are the metric notions when the topology is a metric topology.** For a
  metric space the definitions of [[def-metric-interior-closure-boundary]] are
  stated with balls in place of neighbourhoods, and the balls around $x$ are a
  neighbourhood base at $x$; the identification is carried out where metrizable
  spaces are defined, later on this page, and it is what allows metric examples
  to be quoted here without reproof.

## Definition

For uniform spaces $(X,\mathcal U_X)$ and $(Y,\mathcal U_Y)$, a map $f:X\to Y$ is **uniformly continuous** if for every $V\in\mathcal U_Y$ there is $U\in\mathcal U_X$ such that $(x,x')\in U$ implies $(f(x),f(x'))\in V$. The controlling entourage $U$ is independent of the point $x$.

## Statement

On the set $\widehat X$ of minimal Cauchy filters, the relations $\widehat E$ declaring that two filters have $E$-close members form a separated uniformity.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Minimal Cauchy filters $\mathcal F,\mathcal G$ on $X$.

[L1] Every Cauchy filter has a unique associated minimal Cauchy filter, and every principal filter is Cauchy and therefore has an associated minimal Cauchy filter ([[lem-minimal-cauchy-filter-associated-to-a-cauchy-filter]]).

[L2] Symmetric entourages form a base and admit square roots ([[lem-symmetric-entourages-form-a-base]]).

[L3] The entourage axioms and separatedness are stated in [[def-uniform-space-by-entourages]] and [[def-separated-uniform-space]].

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 Because a uniformity is a proper filter on $X\times X$, its carrier $X$ is nonempty. Choose $x\in X$; then [L1] gives a minimal Cauchy filter associated to the principal filter at $x$, so $\widehat X$ is nonempty. For symmetric $E$, put $(\mathcal F,\mathcal G)\in\widehat E$ when some $A\in\mathcal F$ and $B\in\mathcal G$ satisfy $A\times B\subseteq E$. [L1, L3, construct, choose]

2.1 Every $\mathcal F$ is $\widehat E$-close to itself: choose an $E$-small member of the Cauchy filter and use it on both sides. Thus each $\widehat E$ contains the nonempty diagonal of $\widehat X$. The relation $\widehat E$ is symmetric. If $\widehat E$ and $\widehat D$ have respective witnesses $A\times B$ and $C\times K$, then $(A\cap C)\times(B\cap K)\subseteq E\cap D$, so finite intersections are refined by the corresponding hatted intersection. [step 1.1]

2.2 Choose a symmetric entourage $D$ with $D^{\circ2}\subseteq E$. If $\mathcal F\,\widehat D\,\mathcal G$ via $A\times B\subseteq D$ and $\mathcal G\,\widehat D\,\mathcal H$ via $C\times K\subseteq D$, choose $b\in B\cap C$. Then $aDbDk$ for every $a\in A,k\in K$, so $A\times K\subseteq D^{\circ2}\subseteq E$. Hence $\widehat D\circ\widehat D\subseteq\widehat E$. [step 1.1, L2, choose]

2.3 Steps 2.1 and 2.2 show that the upward closure of the relations $\widehat E$ is a uniformity. To prove separation, suppose $\mathcal F\,\widehat E\,\mathcal G$ for every entourage $E$. Given $A\in\mathcal F$, minimality gives $\mathcal F=m(\mathcal F)$ by [L1], so some $D[C]\subseteq A$ with $C\in\mathcal F$ and symmetric $D$. Choose an entourage $E\subseteq D$ and witnesses $P\in\mathcal F,Q\in\mathcal G$ with $P\times Q\subseteq E$. Pick $c\in C\cap P$. Then $Q\subseteq E[c]\subseteq D[C]\subseteq A$, so $A\in\mathcal G$. Thus $\mathcal F\subseteq\mathcal G$; symmetry gives equality. [step 1.1, L1, L2, choose]

3.1 Therefore the standard relations form the asserted separated uniformity. [step 2.3, L3, discharge-construct] ∎

## Statement

Every Cauchy filter $\mathcal F$ canonically determines a unique Cauchy filter $m(\mathcal F)\subseteq\mathcal F$ that has no strictly coarser Cauchy filter. For every $x\in X$, the principal filter $\mathcal P_x:=\{A\subseteq X:x\in A\}$ is Cauchy and therefore has an associated minimal Cauchy filter $m(\mathcal P_x)$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A Cauchy filter $\mathcal F$ on a uniform space.

[L1] Cauchyness supplies arbitrarily small members of $\mathcal F$ ([[def-cauchy-filter-in-a-uniform-space]]).

[L2] Filter bases generate the least filter containing them ([[def-filter-base]], [[lem-filter-base-generates]]).

[L3] Symmetric entourages form a base and may be chosen with prescribed finite-composite control ([[lem-symmetric-entourages-form-a-base]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 Let $\mathcal B$ consist of all $E[A]$ with $A\in\mathcal F$ and symmetric entourage $E$. Every such set contains the nonempty set $A$. Given $E[A],D[B]\in\mathcal B$, the symmetric entourage $E\cap D$ and the member $A\cap B\in\mathcal F$ give $$ (E\cap D)[A\cap B]\subseteq E[A]\cap D[B]. $$ Thus $\mathcal B$ is a proper downward-directed filter base. Let $m(\mathcal F)$ be the filter it generates. [L2, L3, construct]

2.1 Since $A\subseteq E[A]$, every member of $\mathcal B$ belongs to $\mathcal F$, so $m(\mathcal F)\subseteq\mathcal F$. To prove it Cauchy, let $U$ be an entourage and choose a symmetric $E$ with $E^{\circ3}\subseteq U$. Choose $A\in\mathcal F$ with $A\times A\subseteq E$. If $y,z\in E[A]$, take $a,b\in A$ with $aEy$ and $bEz$; symmetry gives $yEaEbEz$, so $(y,z)\in E^{\circ3}\subseteq U$. Hence $E[A]\in m(\mathcal F)$ is $U$-small. [L1, L3, step 1.1]

2.2 Let $\mathcal G\subseteq\mathcal F$ be Cauchy, and fix $E[A]\in\mathcal B$. Choose a symmetric $D$ with $D\subseteq E$, and a $D$-small $B\in\mathcal G$. Since $A,B\in\mathcal F$, choose $c\in A\cap B$. Then $B\subseteq D[c]\subseteq E[A]$, so $E[A]\in\mathcal G$. Thus every Cauchy filter coarser than $\mathcal F$ contains $m(\mathcal F)$. [L1, L3, step 1.1, choose]

3.1 If a Cauchy filter is coarser than $m(\mathcal F)$, step 2.2 places $m(\mathcal F)$ inside it, so equality holds; hence $m(\mathcal F)$ is minimal. Any minimal Cauchy filter coarser than $\mathcal F$ contains $m(\mathcal F)$ by step 2.2 and must equal it by minimality. This proves uniqueness. [step 2.1, step 2.2]

4.1 For $x\in X$, the set $\{x\}$ belongs to $\mathcal P_x$, and $\{x\}\times\{x\}\subseteq\Delta_X\subseteq E$ for every entourage $E$. Thus $\mathcal P_x$ is Cauchy by [L1], and step 3.1 supplies its associated minimal Cauchy filter. [L1, step 3.1, discharge-construct] ∎

## Statement

If $\mathcal U$ is a uniformity on $X$, then its symmetric entourages form a filter base: for every $E\in\mathcal U$ there is a symmetric $D\in\mathcal U$ with $D\subseteq E$. More generally, for every entourage $E$ and every integer $n\ge 1$, there is a symmetric entourage $D$ whose $n$-fold composite satisfies $D^{\circ n}\subseteq E$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A uniformity $\mathcal U$ on $X$, an entourage $E\in\mathcal U$, and an integer $n\ge 1$.

[A1] A uniformity is a filter whose members are closed under inverse and admit square roots ([[def-uniform-space-by-entourages]]).

[L1] A nonempty, proper family that refines every pair of its members is a filter base ([[def-filter-base]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Choose $R\in\mathcal U$ with $R\circ R\subseteq E$, and put $S:=R\cap R^{-1}$. [A1, choose]

1.2 Put $E_0:=E$. By finitely iterating the square-root axiom, choose entourages $E_1,\ldots,E_n$ such that $E_{k+1}\circ E_{k+1}\subseteq E_k$ for $0\le k<n$, and put $D:=E_n\cap E_n^{-1}$. [A1, choose]

2.1 The set $S$ is an entourage, since $R,R^{-1}\in\mathcal U$ and a filter is closed under intersections; also $S=S^{-1}$ and $S\subseteq R\circ R\subseteq E$, because every entourage contains the diagonal. [step 1.1, A1]

2.2 The entourage $D$ is symmetric and $D\subseteq E_n$. Induction on $k$ gives $D^{\circ 2^k}\subseteq E_{n-k}$ for $0\le k\le n$, hence $D^{\circ 2^n}\subseteq E$. Since every entourage contains the diagonal and $n\le 2^n$, one may insert diagonal factors to obtain $D^{\circ n}\subseteq D^{\circ 2^n}\subseteq E$. [step 1.2, A1, algebra]

3.1 Thus symmetric entourages refine every entourage; their intersections are symmetric entourages and none is empty because each contains the diagonal, so they form a filter base by [L1]. [step 2.1, L1]

4.1 Therefore symmetric entourages form a base and admit the asserted finite-composite control. [step 3.1, step 2.2] ∎

## Statement

For a uniformity $\mathcal U$ on $X$, call $O\subseteq X$ open when every $x\in O$ has an entourage $E$ with $E[x]\subseteq O$. These open sets form a topology on $X$. Its neighbourhood filter at $x$ has $\{E[x]:E\in\mathcal U\}$ as a base.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A uniform space $(X,\mathcal U)$.

[A1] Entourages contain the diagonal, are closed under finite intersection, and have symmetric square roots ([[def-uniform-space-by-entourages]], [[lem-symmetric-entourages-form-a-base]]).

[L1] A topology contains $\varnothing,X$, is closed under arbitrary unions, and under binary intersections ([[def-topological-space]]).

[L2] A neighbourhood base at $x$ refines every neighbourhood of $x$ ([[def-neighbourhood-top]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The sets $\varnothing$ and $X$ are open: the first has no points to test, and for $x\in X$ every entourage ball is contained in $X$. [A1]

1.2 An arbitrary union of open sets is open, because a point in the union lies in one member and retains that member's entourage ball. [A1]

1.3 If $x\in O\cap P$, choose entourage balls $E[x]\subseteq O$ and $F[x]\subseteq P$; then $(E\cap F)[x]\subseteq O\cap P$, so binary intersections are open. [A1]

2.1 By steps 1.1 to 1.3, the open sets form a topology by [L1]. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, L1]

3.1 Let $E$ be an entourage and define $$ O_E=\{y\in E[x]:F[y]\subseteq E[x]\text{ for some }F\in\mathcal U\}. $$ This set is open. Indeed, given $y\in O_E$, choose $F$ as displayed and then a symmetric $G$ with $G\circ G\subseteq F$. If $z\in G[y]$, symmetry gives $G[z]\subseteq(G\circ G)[y]\subseteq F[y]\subseteq E[x]$, so $z\in O_E$; hence $G[y]\subseteq O_E$. Now choose a symmetric $D$ with $D\circ D\subseteq E$. If $y\in D[x]$, then $D[y]\subseteq E[x]$, so $y\in O_E$. Thus $x\in D[x]\subseteq O_E\subseteq E[x]$, proving that $E[x]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$. [A1, step 2.1]

4.1 Conversely, if $N$ is a neighbourhood of $x$, it contains an open set $O$ with $x\in O$; the definition of the topology supplies an entourage $E$ with $E[x]\subseteq O\subseteq N$. Thus the entourage balls refine every neighbourhood, and by step 3.1 they are themselves neighbourhoods. They form a neighbourhood base by [L2]. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L2] ∎
