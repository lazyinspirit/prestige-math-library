You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as a
read-only adversarial proof-refuter for the published-page audit. You are
tool-less: you cannot open a file, run a command, browse, edit, or delegate.
Everything you may rely on is reproduced in the `This dispatch` section. Return
evidence only; Audit-Alpha alone adjudicates and edits.

## Triage — the standing rule (verbatim, binding on you)

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct
  citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

## Adversarial standard

Read the target's title, Statement/Definition/Example/Statement refuted, Facts &
Assumptions, every numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks.
Try to falsify the public claim and every load-bearing inference.

1. Compare every cited fact with the supplied source text before alleging that
   it is weak. Check domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, direction, conclusion,
   and whether the source licenses the exact use.
2. Check that the title and public statement assert no more than the proof
   establishes, and that every proof step uses only available premises.
3. Check both directions of biconditionals, uniqueness/existence claims,
   induction and limiting arguments, empty/zero/endpoint/degenerate cases,
   extended-real conventions, index shifts, and hidden division or choice.
4. Re-read Remarks as skeptically as a numbered step. A false mathematical
   remark is a defect even when the proof is sound.
5. When the target is marked `ai-generated`, actively search for a
   counterexample to its claim, witness, or refutation rather than merely
   checking prose consistency.
6. Treat a false public claim, logically invalid proof, missing necessary
   hypothesis, circularity, or materially inaccurate load-bearing citation as
   fatal. Do not inflate an expository omission or a gap closable within thirty
   seconds into a defect.

## Output format

Reply with exactly this structure and no preamble:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

If `DEFECTS`, give one block per finding:

```text
FINDING 1
  location: [exact title, section, fact label, or numbered step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [the exact mathematical assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, missing hypothesis, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]
```

Then always end with:

```text
BOUNDARY: [specific boundary/counterexample checks and their disposition]
SOURCES:  [confirm every supplied cited item used by the target was inspected]
CHECKED:  [confirm the title, public claim, every numbered step, and Remarks were read]
```

The statement of [[thm-completeness-equivalences]] attaches the Archimedean
property to two of its five clauses and not to the other three. This remark says
exactly why, clause by clause, and records what is proved on this page rather
than what is customary.

**The three that carry it.** Each of the following is proved here, with no
Archimedean hypothesis anywhere in sight:

- (LUB) implies the Archimedean property. This is claim 1 of
  [[lem-lub-implies-nested-intervals]], which is [[thm-of-archimedean]] applied
  to the field: a complete ordered field is Archimedean, because otherwise the
  canonical naturals would be a nonempty set $A$ bounded above, and then
  $\sup A - 1$, being smaller than $\sup A$, is not an upper bound of $A$, so
  some $n \cdot 1_F$ exceeds it and $(n+1)\cdot 1_F$ exceeds $\sup A$.
- (BW) implies the Archimedean property, by [[lem-bw-implies-archimedean]]. If
  the canonical naturals were bounded they would form a bounded sequence, and
  every subsequence of it has consecutive terms at distance at least $1$, so no
  subsequence converges.
- (MCT) implies the Archimedean property, by [[lem-mct-implies-archimedean]]. If
  the canonical naturals were bounded above they would be a nondecreasing
  bounded sequence, hence convergent, hence Cauchy, which the gap of $1$ between
  consecutive terms forbids.

**The two that do not.** Neither (NIP) nor (CC) implies the Archimedean
property, and one field refutes both: the formal Laurent series field
$K = \mathbb{R}((t^{-1}))$ is not Archimedean
([[lem-laurent-non-archimedean]]), has (CC) ([[thm-laurent-cauchy-complete]])
and has (NIP) in the shrinking form of [[def-completeness-properties]]
([[cor-laurent-nested-intervals]]). The consequences are the two false
statements of this page, [[fs-nested-intervals-implies-lub]] and
[[fs-cauchy-complete-implies-lub]]: without the Archimedean hypothesis neither
clause 2 nor clause 4 of the equivalence theorem implies clause 1.

**What distinguishes the two groups.** (LUB), (BW) and (MCT) each quantify over
an object that is assumed only to be *bounded*: a bounded set, a bounded
sequence, a nondecreasing sequence bounded above. In a non-Archimedean field the
canonical naturals are such an object, so each of the three can be tested
against them directly, and each fails on them at once. (NIP) and (CC) quantify
instead over data that are already forced together: nested intervals whose
lengths tend to $0$ in the field, and sequences whose terms get arbitrarily close
to each other in the field. In a non-Archimedean field that is a much stronger
hypothesis than it looks, because "arbitrarily close" now means below every
infinitesimal as well; so few sequences and few interval families qualify, and
the ones that do converge for reasons that have nothing to do with the naturals
being cofinal.

**Two corollaries worth stating plainly.**

- An Archimedean hypothesis is never needed alongside (LUB), (BW) or (MCT), and
  writing one there is not merely redundant but misleading, since it suggests
  the property is weaker than it is.
- The customary phrase "complete ordered field" is ambiguous in exactly one
  place, and that place is (CC). This library resolves it by reserving
  *complete* for the least-upper-bound property
  ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and always writing *Cauchy complete* for the
  other, as [[thm-laurent-cauchy-complete]] does. A text that says "the reals
  are the unique complete ordered field" and means (CC) is stating something
  false, and $K$ is the counterexample.

**A note on what is not claimed.** Nothing above says that (NIP) and (CC) are
equivalent to each other, or that either is equivalent to the Archimedean
property's negation, or that $K$ is the only witness. What is proved is the
implication pattern of [[thm-completeness-equivalences]] and the two failures
just named.

## Statement

Let $K = \mathbb{R}((t^{-1}))$ and let $(I_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ with
$I_n = [a_n, b_n]_K$ be a nested sequence of closed intervals in $K$ whose
lengths tend to $0$ in $K$, that is, for every $\varepsilon > 0$ in $K$ there is
$N$ with $b_n - a_n < \varepsilon$ for all $n \ge N$
([[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]]). Then

$$\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} I_n$$

contains exactly one element of $K$.

**The hypothesis that the lengths tend to $0$ may not be dropped**: this is the
nested interval property in its *shrinking* form only, and nothing on this page
establishes the unrestricted form for $K$. The remarks below record what happens
without the hypothesis.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A nested sequence $(I_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of closed intervals $I_n = [a_n,b_n]_K$ in $K$, so $a_n \le b_n$ and $I_{n+1} \subseteq I_n$ for every $n$, whose lengths tend to $0$ in $K$.

[L1] $[a,b]_K = \{x \in K : a \le x \le b\}$ for $a \le b$; a sequence $(x_n)$ in $K$ is Cauchy in $K$ when for every $\varepsilon > 0$ in $K$ there is $N$ with $|x_n - x_m| < \varepsilon$ for all $n,m \ge N$, and converges to $L$ when for every $\varepsilon > 0$ in $K$ there is $N$ with $|x_n - L| < \varepsilon$ for all $n \ge N$; the lengths $b_n - a_n$ tend to $0$ when for every $\varepsilon > 0$ in $K$ they are eventually $< \varepsilon$ ([[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Every Cauchy sequence in $K$ converges in $K$ ([[thm-laurent-cauchy-complete]]).

[L3] $K$ is an ordered field ([[thm-laurent-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]), so its order is total and transitive and $x < y$ means $0 < y - x$. Compatibility with addition is used below in its NONSTRICT form, $x \le y \Rightarrow x + z \le y + z$, whereas [[lem-of-add-order]] states the STRICT forms and only those ($x < y \Rightarrow x + z < y + z$, and $x < y$ with $z < w$ giving $x + z < y + w$); the nonstrict form is the first strict form together with the case $x = y$, where the two sides are equal, the order being total ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L4] $|z| \ge 0$, $|z| = 0$ only for $z = 0$, and $|z|$ equals $z$ or $-z$; so $|z| = z$ when $z \ge 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]]).

[L5] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total ([[thm-nat-linear-order]], [[def-nat-order]]) and induction is available ([[thm-induction-principle]], [[def-natural-numbers]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For each $n$, the endpoints $a_{n+1}$ and $b_{n+1}$ belong to $I_{n+1}$ because $a_{n+1} \le b_{n+1}$, and $I_{n+1} \subseteq I_n$, so both belong to $I_n$; by [L1] this says $a_n \le a_{n+1}$ and $b_{n+1} \le b_n$. Hence $a_n \le a_{n+1} \le b_{n+1} \le b_n$. [given, L1, L3]

1.2 The intersection contains at most one element. Suppose $x, y \in \bigcap_n I_n$ with $x \ne y$, so $|x - y| > 0$ by [L4]. For each $n$ both $x$ and $y$ lie in $[a_n,b_n]_K$, so $x - y \le b_n - a_n$ and $y - x \le b_n - a_n$ by [L1] and [L3], and since $|x-y|$ is one of $x-y$, $y-x$ by [L4] we get $|x - y| \le b_n - a_n$ for every $n$. Applying the shrinking hypothesis with $\varepsilon := |x-y|$ produces some $n$ with $b_n - a_n < |x-y|$, a contradiction. [given, L1, L3, L4]

2.1 Whenever $n \le m$ one has $a_n \le a_m \le b_m \le b_n$: this is [step 1.1] for $m = n+1$, it is trivial for $m = n$, and the general case follows by induction on $m$ using transitivity of the order. [step 1.1, L3, L5]

3.1 $(a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is Cauchy in $K$. Let $\varepsilon > 0$ in $K$ and take $N$ with $b_n - a_n < \varepsilon$ for all $n \ge N$. Let $n, m \ge N$; by [L5] we may assume $n \le m$, the other case being the same with the roles exchanged. By [step 2.1], $a_n \le a_m \le b_m \le b_n$, so $0 \le a_m - a_n \le b_n - a_n < \varepsilon$, and $|a_m - a_n| = a_m - a_n < \varepsilon$ by [L4]. [step 2.1, given, L1, L3, L4, L5]

4.1 By [L2] there is $L \in K$ with $a_n \to L$ in $K$. [step 3.1, L2]

5.1 $a_n \le L$ for every $n$. Otherwise $L < a_n$ for some $n$; put $\varepsilon := a_n - L > 0$ and use [step 4.1] to fix $N$ with $|a_m - L| < \varepsilon$ for all $m \ge N$. Pick $m$ with $m \ge N$ and $m \ge n$ ([L5]). By [step 2.1], $a_n \le a_m$, so $a_m - L \ge a_n - L = \varepsilon > 0$ and hence $|a_m - L| = a_m - L \ge \varepsilon$ by [L4], contradicting $|a_m - L| < \varepsilon$. [step 2.1, step 4.1, L1, L3, L4, L5]

5.2 $L \le b_n$ for every $n$. Otherwise $b_n < L$ for some $n$; put $\varepsilon := L - b_n > 0$ and fix $N$ with $|a_m - L| < \varepsilon$ for all $m \ge N$. Pick $m$ with $m \ge N$ and $m \ge n$. By [step 2.1], $a_m \le b_m \le b_n$, so $L - a_m \ge L - b_n = \varepsilon > 0$ and hence $|a_m - L| = L - a_m \ge \varepsilon$ by [L4], again a contradiction. [step 2.1, step 4.1, L1, L3, L4, L5]

6.1 By [step 5.1] and [step 5.2], $a_n \le L \le b_n$ for every $n$, so $L \in \bigcap_n I_n$ by [L1] and the intersection is nonempty; by [step 1.2] it has no second element. Hence $\bigcap_n I_n = \{L\}$. [step 5.1, step 5.2, step 1.2, L1] ∎

- **This is the shrinking form, and the restriction is real.** The unrestricted nested interval property — every nested sequence of nonempty closed intervals meets — is **false** in $K$, and [[cex-laurent-nested-intervals-empty]] exhibits a nested sequence with empty intersection. So the hypothesis here is not a convenience of the proof, and no item on this page may be cited for the unrestricted form.

- **A trap in the hypothesis: "lengths $2/n$" does not mean shrinking.** The condition is that the lengths tend to $0$ *in the order of $K$*, tested against every positive $\varepsilon \in K$, not merely against positive real constants. A nested sequence whose $n$-th length is the constant series $\iota(2/(n+1))$ does **not** satisfy it: since $\iota(c)$ takes the nonzero value $c$ at index $0$, clause 4 of [[lem-laurent-non-archimedean]] forbids $|\iota(c)| < t^{-1}$, so no such length ever gets below $\varepsilon = t^{-1}$. Real-indexed shrinking is strictly weaker than shrinking in $K$, and a proof that assumed the former would be proving a different theorem.

- **Where completeness enters.** Exactly once, at [step 4.1]. Everything before it is monotonicity bookkeeping valid in any ordered field, and everything after it uses only the order and the absolute value. That is why the corollary is a corollary of [[thm-laurent-cauchy-complete]] and not an independent argument about series.

## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]). For a natural number
$n \ge 1$, write $n \cdot 1_F := \underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$ for the
$n$-fold sum of the multiplicative identity, and $0 \cdot 1_F := 0$. These are
the **canonical natural numbers** of $F$.

$F$ is **Archimedean** if for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n$ with

$$x < n \cdot 1_F.$$

Equivalently, the canonical naturals $(n \cdot 1_F)_{n \ge 1}$ are **cofinal**:
no single element of $F$ is an upper bound for all of them.

## Remarks

- Equivalently (applying the definition to $1/\varepsilon$): for every
  $\varepsilon > 0$ in $F$ there is $n$ with $1/(n \cdot 1_F) < \varepsilon$, so
  the canonical fractions $1/n$ are arbitrarily small.
- That the canonical naturals are well-defined, positive, and strictly
  increasing is [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]. Every complete ordered field is
  Archimedean ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); an ordered field need not be
  ([[cex-ordered-field-not-archimedean]]).

## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq F$.

- $u \in F$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$; $S$ is
  **bounded above** if it has an upper bound.
- $u \in F$ is a **least upper bound** (or **supremum**, $\sup S$) of $S$ if $u$
  is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le u'$ for every upper bound $u'$ of $S$.

$F$ is a **complete ordered field** (equivalently, $F$ has the
**least-upper-bound property**, or is **Dedekind complete**) if every nonempty
$S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$.

## Remarks

- A least upper bound, if it exists, is unique (two least upper bounds are each
  $\le$ the other, so equal by antisymmetry of the order).
- Applying the property to $\{-s : s \in S\}$ yields the dual **greatest lower
  bound** (infimum) property, so the two are equivalent.
- The Dedekind-cut reals have this property by construction
  ([[thm-dedekind-complete]]); the Cauchy-sequence reals acquire it via
  [[cor-cauchy-reals-lub-complete]]. This definition is the target for the
  uniqueness theorem [[thm-uniqueness-complete-ordered-field]].

## Definition

Throughout, $F$ is an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) with its order and
its absolute value. Sequences in $F$, and the notions of convergence in $F$,
Cauchyness in $F$, boundedness, nondecreasing and nonincreasing, subsequence,
closed interval $[a,b]_F$, nesting, and lengths tending to $0$ in $F$, are the
ones fixed once and for all in [[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]]. They are
not restated here and they are never read in $\mathbb{R}$: every $\varepsilon$
below ranges over the positive elements of $F$ itself.

A sequence $(x_k)$ in $F$ is **bounded above** when there is $B \in F$ with
$x_k \le B$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, and a subset $S \subseteq F$ is bounded
above when there is $B \in F$ with $s \le B$ for every $s \in S$
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-upper-bound]]).

The following are five properties that $F$ may or may not have.

- **(LUB), the least-upper-bound property.** Every nonempty $S \subseteq F$ that
  is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$. This is exactly the condition
  that makes $F$ a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), and
  the two names are used interchangeably here.

- **(MCT), the monotone convergence property.** Every nondecreasing sequence in
  $F$ that is bounded above converges in $F$.

- **(NIP), the nested interval property.** For every nested sequence
  $(I_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of closed intervals $I_k = [a_k, b_k]_F$ of $F$
  whose lengths tend to $0$ in $F$, the intersection

  $$\bigcap_{k \in \mathbb{N}} I_k$$

  is nonempty.

- **(BW), the Bolzano-Weierstrass property.** Every bounded sequence in $F$ has
  a subsequence that converges in $F$.

- **(CC), Cauchy completeness.** Every Cauchy sequence in $F$ converges in $F$.

Alongside these we use the **Archimedean property (ARCH)** of
[[def-archimedean-field]]: for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n$
with $x < n \cdot 1_F$.

## Remarks

- **(NIP) is stated in the shrinking form because that is the form both
  satisfied by the formal Laurent series field and used by the bisection
  theorem.** The field $\mathbb{R}((t^{-1}))$ is Cauchy complete without having
  least upper bounds ([[thm-laurent-cauchy-complete]],
  [[cor-laurent-not-lub-complete]]), and it satisfies shrinking (NIP)
  ([[cor-laurent-nested-intervals]]). The same shrinking condition is exactly
  what the bisection argument of
  [[lem-nested-intervals-and-archimedean-imply-bw]] produces.

- **"Lengths tend to $0$" is read in $F$.** For a non-Archimedean $F$ this is
  strictly stronger than the same words read in $\mathbb{R}$ through some
  identification of the rational scalars, and the difference is not academic:
  the remarks of [[cor-laurent-nested-intervals]] exhibit intervals in
  $\mathbb{R}((t^{-1}))$ whose lengths are the real constants $2/(n+1)$, which
  tend to $0$ in the ordinary real sense and do not tend to $0$ in the order of
  that field.

- **Boundedness of a sequence is two-sided, boundedness above is not.**
  [[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]] calls $(x_k)$ bounded when
  $|x_k| \le M$ for every $k$, which is the hypothesis of (BW); (MCT) asks only
  for the one-sided bound $x_k \le B$, which for a nondecreasing sequence is the
  only side in question, since $x_0 \le x_k$ always.

- **(MCT) is stated for nondecreasing sequences only.** The nonincreasing case
  is not a separate assumption: if $(x_k)$ is nonincreasing and bounded below by
  $b$ then $(-x_k)$ is nondecreasing and bounded above by $-b$, and $x_k \to L$
  exactly when $-x_k \to -L$, because $|(-x_k) - (-L)| = |x_k - L|$. That
  reduction is used in the proof of [[lem-mct-implies-lub]].

- **Nothing here presumes that any of the five holds.** They are predicates on
  an ordered field, and the point of the page they open is that in the presence
  of (ARCH) they are all the same predicate ([[thm-completeness-equivalences]]),
  while without it two of them are strictly weaker
  ([[fs-nested-intervals-implies-lub]], [[fs-cauchy-complete-implies-lub]]).

- **(CC) is this library's third rendering of "Cauchy complete", and for $\mathbb{R}$ all three agree.** [[def-cauchy-in-metric]] and [[def-complete-metric-space]] read Cauchyness and completeness in a metric space, and the case $n = 1$ of [[thm-euclidean-space-complete]] proves $(\mathbb{R}, |x-y|)$ complete; [[def-real-limit]] reads both notions for real sequences, with $\varepsilon$ ranging over the positive rationals; the present definition reads them in an ordered field $F$. For $F = \mathbb{R}$ under the metric $d(x,y) = |x-y|$ of [[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]] the three unfold to the same quantified statement: below every positive real lies a positive rational ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), so the two ranges of $\varepsilon$ pick out the same Cauchy sequences and the same convergent ones. So "$\mathbb{R}$ satisfies (CC)" is a statement this library has already proved twice, as [[thm-cauchy-criterion-via-lub]] and as the case $n = 1$ of [[thm-euclidean-space-complete]]. The parallel stops at $\mathbb{R}$. The absolute value of an ordered field takes its values in $F$, while a metric is required to take its values in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-metric-space]]), so for a non-Archimedean $F$ the map $(x,y) \mapsto |x-y|$ is not a metric in this library's sense and the metric development says nothing about it. That is why [[lem-of-sequence-basics]] had to be proved from the order axioms alone, although its Cauchy clauses reappear for metric spaces as [[lem-metric-convergent-implies-cauchy]], [[lem-metric-cauchy-bounded]] and [[lem-metric-cauchy-with-convergent-subsequence]]. Neither development generalises the other; they meet exactly at $\mathbb{R}$.

## Statement

**False claim:** every ordered field in which every Cauchy sequence converges,
that is, every ordered field with (CC) as in [[def-completeness-properties]],
has the least-upper-bound property (LUB).

This is clause 4 of [[thm-completeness-equivalences]] with its Archimedean
hypothesis deleted. The witness is again the formal Laurent series field
$K = \mathbb{R}((t^{-1}))$: every Cauchy sequence in $K$ converges in $K$, and
$K$ has no least upper bound for the set of its own canonical naturals.

**This is the sharpest of the failures on this page**, because "complete" is the
word most often used loosely for both properties at once. In $\mathbb{R}$ they
coincide; in an ordered field they do not, and the difference is exactly the
Archimedean property.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The formal Laurent series field $K = \mathbb{R}((t^{-1}))$.

[L1] $K$ is an ordered field ([[thm-laurent-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Every sequence in $K$ that is Cauchy in $K$ converges in $K$ ([[thm-laurent-cauchy-complete]]); Cauchyness and convergence in an ordered field are as in [[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]], and that is exactly (CC) ([[def-completeness-properties]]).

[L3] $K$ is not a complete ordered field: the set $A = \{\, n \cdot 1_K : n \in \mathbb{N}\,\}$ is nonempty and bounded above by $t$ and has no least upper bound in $K$ ([[cor-laurent-not-lub-complete]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L4] $K$ is not Archimedean, since $n \cdot 1_K < t$ for every natural $n$ ([[lem-laurent-non-archimedean]], [[def-archimedean-field]]).

[L5] For an ordered field, the Archimedean property together with (CC) does imply (LUB) ([[thm-completeness-equivalences]], clause 4 implies clause 1).

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $K$ is an ordered field. [L1]

1.2 $K$ has (CC): every Cauchy sequence in $K$ converges in $K$. [L2]

1.3 $K$ does not have (LUB), the set of its canonical naturals being nonempty, bounded above and without a least upper bound. [L3]

2.1 So $K$ is an ordered field with (CC) and without (LUB), and the claim is false. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3]

3.1 What fails in $K$ is precisely the hypothesis that the claim deleted: $K$ is not Archimedean, and with that hypothesis restored the implication is true. [step 1.1, L4, L5] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the thresholds are read is what makes this possible.** Cauchyness in
  $K$ is tested against every positive element of $K$, including the
  infinitesimals ([[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]]), so the condition is
  much stronger in $K$ than the same words read with rational thresholds. It is
  strong enough that only sequences whose coefficients freeze can satisfy it,
  and those all converge. Meanwhile the canonical naturals, which are what (LUB)
  fails on, are not Cauchy at all, so (CC) never gets a chance to see them.

- **The three properties $K$ has and the three it lacks.** It has (CC) and (NIP)
  in the shrinking form ([[cor-laurent-nested-intervals]]) and it is an ordered
  field; it lacks (LUB), and hence also (BW) and (MCT), each of which would force
  it to be Archimedean ([[lem-bw-implies-archimedean]],
  [[lem-mct-implies-archimedean]]).

- **A reader who wants a single sentence:** Cauchy completeness says the field
  has no holes that a sequence can point at; the least-upper-bound property says
  it has no holes at all. In a non-Archimedean field a sequence indexed by
  $\mathbb{N}$ is too short to point at the holes.

## Statement

**False claim:** every ordered field with the nested interval property (NIP) of
[[def-completeness-properties]] has the least-upper-bound property (LUB).

This is clause 2 of [[thm-completeness-equivalences]] with its Archimedean
hypothesis deleted, and the deletion is exactly what makes it false. The witness
is the formal Laurent series field $K = \mathbb{R}((t^{-1}))$, which satisfies
(NIP) and has no least upper bound for the set of its own canonical naturals.

Note that the false claim is being refuted in the *shrinking* form of (NIP),
which is the weaker hypothesis and therefore makes the implication stronger.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The formal Laurent series field $K = \mathbb{R}((t^{-1}))$.

[L1] $K$ is an ordered field ([[thm-laurent-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Every nested sequence of closed intervals of $K$ whose lengths tend to $0$ in $K$ has exactly one point in its intersection ([[cor-laurent-nested-intervals]]); intervals, nesting and lengths tending to $0$ in an ordered field are as in [[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]], and (NIP) asks exactly that such an intersection be nonempty ([[def-completeness-properties]]).

[L3] $K$ is not a complete ordered field: the set $A = \{\, n \cdot 1_K : n \in \mathbb{N}\,\}$ is nonempty and bounded above by $t$ and has no least upper bound in $K$ ([[cor-laurent-not-lub-complete]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L4] $K$ is not Archimedean, since $n \cdot 1_K < t$ for every natural $n$ ([[lem-laurent-non-archimedean]], [[def-archimedean-field]]).

[L5] For an ordered field, the Archimedean property together with (NIP) does imply (LUB) ([[thm-completeness-equivalences]], clause 2 implies clause 1).

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $K$ is an ordered field. [L1]

1.2 $K$ has (NIP): any nested sequence of closed intervals of $K$ whose lengths tend to $0$ in $K$ has a point in its intersection, indeed exactly one. [L2]

1.3 $K$ does not have (LUB), the set of its canonical naturals being nonempty, bounded above and without a least upper bound. [L3]

2.1 So $K$ is an ordered field with (NIP) and without (LUB), and the claim is false. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3]

3.1 What fails in $K$ is precisely the hypothesis that the claim deleted: $K$ is not Archimedean, and with that hypothesis restored the implication is true. [step 1.1, L4, L5] ∎

## Remarks

- **The failure is not an accident of one field.** By [[lem-lub-implies-nested-intervals]] every field with (LUB) is Archimedean, so any witness at all must be non-Archimedean; and in a non-Archimedean field the shrinking hypothesis in (NIP) is a severe restriction, because a length that tends to $0$ in the order of the field must get below every infinitesimal. That is why checking shrinking (NIP) in $K$ is substantive, and why $K$ can satisfy (NIP) while failing (LUB) at all.

- **$\mathbb{R}(t)$ will not do as a witness**, although it is the library's other non-Archimedean ordered field ([[cex-ordered-field-not-archimedean]]). Nothing in this library establishes any nested interval property for it, and the page that built $K$ says why a new field was constructed rather than reusing that one.

- **The companion failure** is [[fs-cauchy-complete-implies-lub]], refuted by the same field. Together they are the exact content of the Archimedean hypotheses in clauses 2 and 4 of [[thm-completeness-equivalences]].

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field with the Bolzano-Weierstrass property (BW) of
[[def-completeness-properties]]. Then $F$ is Archimedean
([[def-archimedean-field]]).

Consequently (BW) needs no Archimedean hypothesis attached to it, in contrast
with the nested interval property and with Cauchy completeness, which do
([[fs-nested-intervals-implies-lub]], [[fs-cauchy-complete-implies-lub]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with (BW).

[L1] The property (BW): every bounded sequence in $F$ has a subsequence converging in $F$ ([[def-completeness-properties]]).

[L2] Sequences in an ordered field: a sequence is a function $\mathbb{N} \to F$; it is bounded when $|x_k| \le M$ for every $k$ and some $M \in F$; a subsequence is taken along a strictly increasing $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$; convergence and Cauchyness in $F$ are as fixed there ([[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Archimedean property: $F$ is Archimedean when for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$, where $0 \cdot 1_F = 0$ and $(n+1)\cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ ([[def-archimedean-field]]).

[L4] Canonical naturals: $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for $n \ge 1$, the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing on $\{1,2,3,\dots\}$, and $(m+n)\cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L5] Absolute value: $|u| = u$ whenever $u \ge 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L6] A sequence converging in $F$ is Cauchy in $F$ (clause 3 of [[lem-of-sequence-basics]]).

[L7] Order arithmetic: $0 < 1_F$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]); the order is total, so the failure of $x < y$ is $y \le x$; adding a constant preserves the order ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[def-ordered-field]]). Here [[lem-of-add-order]] states the STRICT forms and only those; the nonstrict forms used below are those together with the equality cases, which trichotomy settles, the order being total ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L8] Discreteness of $\mathbb{N}$: $m < p$ if and only if $m + 1 \le p$ ([[lem-nat-discrete]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose $F$ has (BW) and is not Archimedean; then there is $x \in F$ such that $x < n \cdot 1_F$ fails for every natural $n$, that is, $n \cdot 1_F \le x$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. [L3, L7, assume-contra]

1.2 Let $(y_k)$ be the sequence in $F$ given by $y_k := k \cdot 1_F$, so that $y_0 = 0$, $y_{k+1} = y_k + 1_F$, and $y_k \ge 0$ for every $k$. [L2, L3, L4]

2.1 $(y_k)$ is bounded: $|y_k| = y_k \le x$ for every $k$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L2, L5]

3.1 By (BW) there is a strictly increasing $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ and an $L \in F$ with $y_{n_j} \to L$ in $F$. [step 2.1, L1, L2]

4.1 The subsequence $(y_{n_j})$ is therefore Cauchy in $F$, so, $1_F$ being positive, there is $J \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|y_{n_j} - y_{n_i}| < 1_F$ for all $i, j \ge J$. [step 3.1, L2, L6, L7]

5.1 But $n_J < n_{J+1}$ gives $n_J + 1 \le n_{J+1}$ and hence $y_{n_{J+1}} \ge y_{n_J + 1} = y_{n_J} + 1_F$, so $y_{n_{J+1}} - y_{n_J} \ge 1_F > 0$ and $|y_{n_{J+1}} - y_{n_J}| \ge 1_F$, contradicting step 4.1. [step 1.2, step 4.1, L4, L5, L7, L8]

6.1 The assumption of step 1.1 is therefore untenable, and an ordered field with (BW) is Archimedean. [step 5.1, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **The witness sequence is the obstruction itself.** In a non-Archimedean field
  the canonical naturals are bounded, so they form a bounded sequence; and no
  subsequence of them can converge, because consecutive terms of any
  subsequence stay at distance at least $1_F$. That is the whole argument, and
  it shows that (BW) fails in every non-Archimedean ordered field, for instance
  in $\mathbb{R}(t)$ ([[cex-ordered-field-not-archimedean]]) and in
  $\mathbb{R}((t^{-1}))$ ([[lem-laurent-non-archimedean]]).

- Note which direction is being used: the sequence is bounded and has no
  convergent subsequence, so (BW) is contradicted. Nothing here says that
  $(y_k)$ fails to be Cauchy for some other reason; it is Cauchy along no
  subsequence at all.

## Statement

Let $K = \mathbb{R}((t^{-1}))$ be the ordered field of
[[thm-laurent-ordered-field]], and identify a natural number with its image in
$\mathbb{Z}$ when it is used as an index. Then:

1. $n \cdot 1_K < t$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$; consequently $K$ is **not**
   Archimedean ([[def-archimedean-field]]).
2. $0_K < t^{-(k+1)} < t^{-k}$ for every $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.
3. **(Countable cofinality.)** For every $\varepsilon \in K$ with
   $\varepsilon > 0_K$ there is $k \in \mathbb{N}$ with
   $0_K < t^{-k} < \varepsilon$; indeed every integer $k > v(\varepsilon)$
   works.
4. **(The monomials measure the valuation.)** For $h \in K$ and $k \in
   \mathbb{Z}$: if $h(j) = 0$ for every $j \le k$ then $|h| < t^{-k}$; and
   conversely, if $|h| < t^{-k}$ then $h(j) = 0$ for every $j < k$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $K$ with its valuation $v$, leading coefficient $\operatorname{lc}$, monomials $t^{-a}$ and constants $\iota(c)$.

[L1] For nonzero $h \in K$, $h(k) = 0$ for $k < v(h)$ and $h(v(h)) = \operatorname{lc}(h) \ne 0$; $t^{-a}$ is $1$ at index $a$ and $0$ elsewhere, so $t^{-a} \ne 0_K$ with $v(t^{-a}) = a$ and $\operatorname{lc}(t^{-a}) = 1$; and $t = t^{-(-1)}$ ([[def-formal-laurent-series]]).

[L2] $K$ is an ordered field in which $f < g$ holds exactly when $g - f \ne 0_K$ and $\operatorname{lc}(g-f) > 0$; for $f \ne 0_K$ one has $|f| \ne 0_K$, $v(|f|) = v(f)$ and $\operatorname{lc}(|f|) > 0$; and $n \cdot 1_K = \iota(n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}})$, which for $n \ge 1$ is nonzero with $v = 0$ ([[thm-laurent-ordered-field]], [[def-abs-value]]).

[L3] For nonzero $f, g \in K$: $-f \ne 0_K$ with $v(-f) = v(f)$; and if $v(f) < v(g)$ then $f + g \ne 0_K$ with $\operatorname{lc}(f+g) = \operatorname{lc}(f)$ ([[lem-laurent-valuation]]).

[L4] An ordered field $F$ is Archimedean when for every $x \in F$ there is a natural $n$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$; and in an ordered field exactly one of $x < y$, $x = y$, $y < x$ holds ([[def-archimedean-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] The order on $\mathbb{Z}$ is total, and every integer $\ge 0$ is the image of a unique natural number; so for every $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ there is a natural $k$ whose image exceeds $m$ ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]], [[def-int-order]], [[lem-nat-embeds-int]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For every $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ the monomial $t^{-k}$ is nonzero with $\operatorname{lc}(t^{-k}) = 1 > 0$, so $t^{-k} > 0_K$ by [L2]; and since $v(t^{-k}) = k < k+1 = v(-t^{-(k+1)})$ by [L1] and [L3], the difference $t^{-k} - t^{-(k+1)}$ is nonzero with leading coefficient $\operatorname{lc}(t^{-k}) = 1 > 0$, so $t^{-(k+1)} < t^{-k}$. [L1, L2, L3]

1.2 Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. If $n = 0$ then $t - n \cdot 1_K = t$, which is nonzero with $\operatorname{lc}(t) = 1 > 0$. If $n \ge 1$ then $n \cdot 1_K$ is nonzero with $v(n \cdot 1_K) = 0$, so $-(n\cdot 1_K)$ is nonzero with valuation $0$ by [L3], while $v(t) = -1 < 0$; hence $t - n\cdot 1_K$ is nonzero with leading coefficient $\operatorname{lc}(t) = 1 > 0$ by [L3]. In both cases $n \cdot 1_K < t$ by [L2]. [L1, L2, L3]

1.3 Conversely, let $h \in K$ and $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $|h| < t^{-k}$, and suppose $h \ne 0_K$ with $v(h) < k$. Then $v(|h|) = v(h) < k = v(t^{-k})$ and $\operatorname{lc}(|h|) > 0$ by [L2], so $|h| - t^{-k}$ is nonzero with leading coefficient $\operatorname{lc}(|h|) > 0$ by [L3], giving $t^{-k} < |h|$ and contradicting $|h| < t^{-k}$ by the trichotomy of [L4]. Hence $h = 0_K$ or $v(h) \ge k$, and in either case $h(j) = 0$ for every $j < k$ by [L1]. [L1, L2, L3, L4]

2.1 Let $h \in K$ and $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $h(j) = 0$ for every $j \le k$. If $h = 0_K$ then $|h| = 0_K < t^{-k}$ by [step 1.1]. Otherwise $h \ne 0_K$ with $v(h) > k$, so $|h| \ne 0_K$ with $v(|h|) = v(h) > k = v(t^{-k})$ by [L1] and [L2]; then $t^{-k} - |h|$ is nonzero with leading coefficient $\operatorname{lc}(t^{-k}) = 1 > 0$ by [L3], so $|h| < t^{-k}$ by [L2]. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L3]

2.2 Let $\varepsilon \in K$ with $\varepsilon > 0_K$, so $\varepsilon \ne 0_K$ and $\operatorname{lc}(\varepsilon) > 0$ by [L2]; put $m := v(\varepsilon)$ and use [L5] to fix a natural $k$ with $k > m$. Then $v(\varepsilon) = m < k = v(t^{-k}) = v(-t^{-k})$ by [L1] and [L3], so $\varepsilon - t^{-k}$ is nonzero with leading coefficient $\operatorname{lc}(\varepsilon) > 0$, that is $t^{-k} < \varepsilon$; and $t^{-k} > 0_K$ by [step 1.1]. The same computation applies to every integer $k > m$. [step 1.1, L1, L2, L3, L5]

2.3 By [step 1.2], $n \cdot 1_K < t$ for every natural $n$; by the trichotomy of [L4] no natural $n$ can then satisfy $t < n \cdot 1_K$, so the defining condition of [L4] fails at $x = t$ and $K$ is not Archimedean. [step 1.2, L4]

3.1 Clause 1 is [step 1.2] with [step 2.3], clause 2 is [step 1.1], clause 3 is [step 2.2], and clause 4 is [step 2.1] together with [step 1.3]. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 1.3, step 2.2, step 2.3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why clause 3 is the pivotal one.** The valuation takes its values in
  $\mathbb{Z}$, which has countable cofinality, and clause 3 is the translation
  of that fact into the order of $K$: a *countable* family, the monomials
  $t^{-k}$ with $k \in \mathbb{N}$, already gets below every positive element.
  This is what makes the sequential Cauchy condition in $K$ testable against
  countably many thresholds, and it is the reason a sequence indexed by
  $\mathbb{N}$ suffices to reach a limit in [[thm-laurent-cauchy-complete]].
  Nothing like it would hold if the exponents were allowed to range over a
  group of uncountable cofinality.

- **Non-Archimedean here is a statement about $t$, not about the constants.**
  The canonical naturals of $K$ are the constant series
  $n \cdot 1_K = \iota(n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}})$ (clause 3 of
  [[thm-laurent-ordered-field]]), all of valuation $0$, and what bounds them
  above is $t$, of valuation $-1$. The computation in step 1.2 uses nothing
  about $t$ beyond that: every *positive* element of negative valuation exceeds
  every canonical natural, because a strict inequality between valuations
  decides the comparison outright, whatever the coefficients are.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field with the least-upper-bound property (LUB) of
[[def-completeness-properties]]. Then:

1. $F$ is Archimedean ([[def-archimedean-field]]);
2. $F$ has the nested interval property (NIP).

The intersection point produced in claim 2 is the supremum of the left
endpoints, and the proof does not use the hypothesis that the lengths tend to
$0$: an ordered field with (LUB) satisfies the *unrestricted* nested interval
property, of which (NIP) as defined is a special case.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with the least-upper-bound property, and a nested sequence $(I_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of closed intervals $I_k = [a_k, b_k]_F$ of $F$, so that $a_k \le b_k$ for every $k$ and $I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k$ for every $k$.

[L1] Least upper bounds: every nonempty $S \subseteq F$ bounded above has a least upper bound $\sup S \in F$; a least upper bound is an upper bound and is $\le$ every upper bound ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-upper-bound]]).

[L2] Every complete ordered field is Archimedean ([[thm-of-archimedean]]).

[L3] The properties (LUB), (NIP) and the Archimedean property, as fixed in [[def-completeness-properties]] and [[def-archimedean-field]]; (LUB) for $F$ is by definition the statement that $F$ is a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L4] Closed intervals and nesting in $F$: $[a,b]_F = \{x \in F : a \le x \le b\}$ for $a \le b$, and $(I_k)$ is nested when $I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k$ for every $k$ ([[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]]).

[L5] The order of $F$ is total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L6] Induction principle on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]), and the order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total, so of any two indices one is the larger ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Having (LUB) is by definition being a complete ordered field, so $F$ is a complete ordered field. [L1, L3]

1.2 For every $k$: $a_{k+1}$ and $b_{k+1}$ lie in $I_{k+1}$, hence in $I_k$, so $a_k \le a_{k+1} \le b_{k+1} \le b_k$. [L4, L5]

2.1 $F$ is Archimedean, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, L2]

2.2 By induction on the difference of the indices, $a_j \le a_m$ and $b_m \le b_j$ whenever $j \le m$. [step 1.2, L5, L6]

3.1 For all $j, l \in \mathbb{N}$ one has $a_j \le b_l$: letting $m$ be the larger of $j$ and $l$, $a_j \le a_m \le b_m \le b_l$. [step 1.2, step 2.2, L5, L6]

4.1 The set $A := \{\, a_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\}$ is nonempty and is bounded above by $b_0$, so $c := \sup A$ exists in $F$. [step 3.1, L1]

5.1 For every $k$: $a_k \le c$ because $c$ is an upper bound of $A$; and $c \le b_k$ because $b_k$ is an upper bound of $A$ by step 3.1 while $c$ is the least such. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L1]

6.1 So $c \in [a_k, b_k]_F$ for every $k$, the intersection of the $I_k$ is nonempty, and $F$ has (NIP), which with step 2.1 gives both claims. [step 2.1, step 5.1, L3, L4] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the lengths would be used.** They are not used at all above. Their
  role is to force the intersection to be a *single* point: if the lengths tend
  to $0$ and $c, c'$ both lie in every $I_k$ then $|c - c'| \le b_k - a_k$ for
  every $k$, so $|c - c'|$ is below every positive element of $F$ and therefore
  $0$. Uniqueness is not part of (NIP) as defined in
  [[def-completeness-properties]] and is not needed anywhere on this page.

- **The converse of claim 1 fails, and that is the point of two items later on
  this page.** [[fs-nested-intervals-implies-lub]] shows that (NIP) does not
  imply (LUB), and [[fs-cauchy-complete-implies-lub]] shows the same for (CC);
  in both the witness is a non-Archimedean field, so neither carries the
  Archimedean property that (LUB) carries here.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field with the monotone convergence property (MCT) of
[[def-completeness-properties]]. Then $F$ is Archimedean
([[def-archimedean-field]]).

So (MCT), like (BW) and like (LUB), carries the Archimedean property on its own,
and the hypothesis attached to (CC) in
[[lem-cauchy-complete-and-archimedean-imply-mct]] need not be attached here.
This is what lets [[rem-where-the-archimedean-hypothesis-is-needed]] sort the
five properties into those that do and those that do not.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ with (MCT).

[L1] The property (MCT): every nondecreasing sequence in $F$ that is bounded above converges in $F$ ([[def-completeness-properties]]).

[L2] Sequences in an ordered field: a sequence is a function $\mathbb{N} \to F$; it is nondecreasing when $x_j \le x_k$ for all $j \le k$; convergence and Cauchyness in $F$ are as fixed there ([[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Archimedean property: $F$ is Archimedean when for every $x \in F$ there is a natural $n$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$, where $0 \cdot 1_F = 0$ and $(n+1)\cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ ([[def-archimedean-field]]).

[L4] Canonical naturals: $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ and $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing on $\{1,2,3,\dots\}$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L5] A sequence converging in $F$ is Cauchy in $F$ (clause 3 of [[lem-of-sequence-basics]]).

[L6] Order arithmetic: $0 < 1_F$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]); the order is total, so the failure of $x < y$ is $y \le x$; adding a constant preserves the order ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[def-ordered-field]]); and $|u| = u$ whenever $u \ge 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]). Here [[lem-of-add-order]] states the STRICT forms and only those; the nonstrict forms used below are those together with the equality cases, which trichotomy settles, the order being total ([[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose $F$ has (MCT) and is not Archimedean; then there is $x \in F$ with $n \cdot 1_F \le x$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. [L3, L6, assume-contra]

1.2 Let $(y_k)$ be the sequence $y_k := k \cdot 1_F$ in $F$, so $y_0 = 0$ and $y_{k+1} = y_k + 1_F$; it is nondecreasing, since $0 = y_0 < y_n$ for $n \ge 1$ and $j \mapsto j \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing on the positive naturals. [L2, L3, L4]

2.1 $(y_k)$ is bounded above by $x$, so (MCT) makes it converge in $F$ to some $L$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L1, L2]

3.1 Being convergent, $(y_k)$ is Cauchy in $F$, so, $1_F$ being positive, there is $N \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|y_k - y_l| < 1_F$ for all $k, l \ge N$. [step 2.1, L2, L5, L6]

4.1 But $y_{N+1} - y_N = 1_F > 0$, so $|y_{N+1} - y_N| = 1_F$, which is not $< 1_F$; this contradicts step 3.1. [step 1.2, step 3.1, L6]

5.1 The assumption of step 1.1 is therefore untenable, and an ordered field with (MCT) is Archimedean. [step 4.1, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why this item exists.** Without it, the natural reading of the equivalence
  theorem would attach an Archimedean hypothesis to (MCT) as well, and
  [[rem-where-the-archimedean-hypothesis-is-needed]] would answer its own
  question wrongly. With it the answer is clean: (LUB), (BW) and (MCT) each
  imply the Archimedean property, while (NIP) and (CC) do not
  ([[fs-nested-intervals-implies-lub]], [[fs-cauchy-complete-implies-lub]]).

- **The witness is the same sequence as in [[lem-bw-implies-archimedean]]**, the
  canonical naturals, but the two arguments use different failures of it. There
  the sequence is bounded and has no convergent subsequence; here it is
  nondecreasing and bounded above and has no limit. Neither argument implies the
  other, because neither (BW) nor (MCT) is assumed in the other's proof.

- The gap of exactly $1_F$ between consecutive terms is what does the work, and
  it is available in every ordered field: $1_F > 0$ by
  [[cor-of-one-positive]], and no smallness of $1_F$ relative to $x$ is
  possible, since the Cauchy condition is tested at the threshold $1_F$ itself.

Let $F$ be an ordered field, with the five properties (LUB), (MCT), (NIP), (BW),
(CC) and the Archimedean property (ARCH) as in
[[def-completeness-properties]] and [[def-archimedean-field]]. The following
five statements about $F$ are equivalent:

1. (LUB);
2. (ARCH) and (NIP);
3. (BW);
4. (ARCH) and (CC);
5. (MCT).

Moreover each of (LUB), (BW) and (MCT) implies (ARCH) on its own, so in
statements 1, 3 and 5 the Archimedean property is a consequence rather than a
hypothesis.

**The Archimedean hypothesis in statements 2 and 4 may not be dropped.** It is
not an artefact of the proof: the nested interval property without it does not
imply (LUB) ([[fs-nested-intervals-implies-lub]]), and neither does Cauchy
completeness without it ([[fs-cauchy-complete-implies-lub]]). Both are refuted
by the same witness, the formal Laurent series field
$\mathbb{R}((t^{-1}))$.

The equivalence is proved as a single cycle
$1 \Rightarrow 2 \Rightarrow 3 \Rightarrow 4 \Rightarrow 5 \Rightarrow 1$, each
arrow being one lemma of this page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$.

[L1] (LUB) implies (ARCH) and (NIP) ([[lem-lub-implies-nested-intervals]]).

[L2] (ARCH) together with (NIP) implies (BW) ([[lem-nested-intervals-and-archimedean-imply-bw]]).

[L3] (BW) implies (ARCH) ([[lem-bw-implies-archimedean]]).

[L4] (BW) implies (CC) ([[lem-bw-implies-cauchy-complete]]).

[L5] (ARCH) together with (CC) implies (MCT) ([[lem-cauchy-complete-and-archimedean-imply-mct]]).

[L6] (MCT) implies (ARCH) ([[lem-mct-implies-archimedean]]).

[L7] (ARCH) together with (MCT) implies (LUB) ([[lem-mct-implies-lub]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Statement 1 implies statement 2: (LUB) gives both (ARCH) and (NIP). [L1]

1.2 Statement 2 implies statement 3: (ARCH) with (NIP) gives (BW). [L2]

1.3 Statement 3 implies statement 4: (BW) gives (ARCH), and (BW) gives (CC), so it gives their conjunction. [L3, L4]

1.4 Statement 4 implies statement 5: (ARCH) with (CC) gives (MCT). [L5]

1.5 Statement 5 implies statement 1: (MCT) gives (ARCH) by [L6], and (ARCH) with (MCT) gives (LUB) by [L7]. [L6, L7]

2.1 Steps 1.1 to 1.5 form a cycle passing through all five statements, so for any two of them there is a chain of implications from the first to the second; the five are therefore equivalent. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, step 1.4, step 1.5]

2.2 Each of (LUB), (BW) and (MCT) implies (ARCH): the first by [L1], the second by [L3], the third by [L6]. [step 1.1, step 1.3, step 1.5, L1, L3, L6]

3.1 Both assertions of the statement are established, by steps 2.1 and 2.2. [step 2.1, step 2.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **What the cycle costs.** Seven lemmas suffice for the whole equivalence, because a single cycle through all five statements yields every implication between them, and the arrangement is chosen so that no lemma has to carry an Archimedean hypothesis it cannot discharge. Statement 3 is deliberately the hinge: (BW) is the one property that both implies (ARCH) and is implied by a nested interval argument, so the cycle can enter and leave it without an extra hypothesis.

- **Read as a statement about $\mathbb{R}$**, the theorem says that the five familiar theorems of a first analysis course are not five theorems but one, and that the least-upper-bound axiom could have been replaced by any of the other four (with (ARCH) alongside, where required). This library takes (LUB) as the axiom ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and proves the others from it on earlier pages; nothing here re-proves them for $\mathbb{R}$, and nothing here may be cited as a proof about $\mathbb{R}$ that is not already there.

- **The two failures are genuinely different from the three successes.** (NIP) and (CC) are both statements about sequences whose data are already close together, and neither of them ever produces a new element far away; that is why an infinitesimal layer can be added to a field without disturbing them, and why the naturals can stay bounded. (LUB), (BW) and (MCT) each quantify over an object that is only assumed *bounded*, so each of them can be tested against the canonical naturals themselves, and each fails at once when those are bounded. [[rem-where-the-archimedean-hypothesis-is-needed]] develops this.

## Statement

Every sequence $(f^{(n)})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $K = \mathbb{R}((t^{-1}))$ that
is Cauchy in $K$ ([[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]]) converges in $K$. That
is, the ordered field $K$ of [[thm-laurent-ordered-field]] is **sequentially
Cauchy complete**.

The limit is built coefficient by coefficient: at each index $j \in \mathbb{Z}$
the real numbers $f^{(n)}(j)$ are eventually constant in $n$, and $L(j)$ is that
eventual value.

## Scratch

The whole theorem turns on one structural fact about $K$, and it is worth
isolating before the proof: **the value group is $\mathbb{Z}$, so it has
countable cofinality.** Concretely, the countably many monomials $t^{-k}$,
$k \in \mathbb{N}$, get below every positive element of $K$
([[lem-laurent-non-archimedean]], clause 3). Two consequences drive everything.

First, the Cauchy condition, which quantifies over the uncountably many positive
$\varepsilon \in K$, is *equivalent* to its restriction to the countable family
$\varepsilon = t^{-(k+1)}$, and by clause 4 of the same lemma that restricted
condition says exactly: for each $k$ the coefficients at all indices $j \le k$
are eventually constant along the sequence.

Second, a sequence indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ is long enough to reach the limit.
For each of the countably many thresholds $t^{-k}$ there is an index $N_k$ past
which the sequence is that close, and $\sup$-free bookkeeping over $\mathbb{N}$
assembles the $N_k$ into a single limit. In a field whose value group had
uncountable cofinality this last step would fail, and a sequence would not
suffice.

The one genuinely non-formal point is that the assembled $L$ must have support
bounded below, so that it is an element of $K$ at all. That does not follow from
the eventual constancy at each index separately; it comes from the *single*
threshold $k = 0$, which already pins down every negative index at once.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(f^{(n)})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $K$ that is Cauchy in $K$.

[L1] $K$ consists of the functions $\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R}$ whose support is bounded below; $t^{-a}$ is $1$ at index $a$ and $0$ elsewhere ([[def-formal-laurent-series]]).

[L2] $K$ is an ordered field, so its order is transitive and total ([[thm-laurent-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-abs-value]]); and $(g - h)(j) = g(j) - h(j)$ for $g, h \in K$ ([[lem-laurent-series-ring]]).

[L3] In $K$: $0_K < t^{-(k+1)} < t^{-k}$ for every $k \in \mathbb{Z}$; for every $\varepsilon > 0$ in $K$ there is $k \in \mathbb{N}$ with $t^{-k} < \varepsilon$; if $h(j) = 0$ for every $j \le k$ then $|h| < t^{-k}$; and if $|h| < t^{-k}$ then $h(j) = 0$ for every $j < k$ ([[lem-laurent-non-archimedean]]).

[L4] $(x_n)$ is Cauchy in $K$ when for every $\varepsilon > 0$ in $K$ there is $N \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_n - x_m| < \varepsilon$ for all $n, m \ge N$; and $(x_n)$ converges to $L$ in $K$ when for every $\varepsilon > 0$ in $K$ there is $N$ with $|x_n - L| < \varepsilon$ for all $n \ge N$ ([[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]]).

[L5] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L6] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total ([[thm-nat-linear-order]], [[def-nat-order]]), induction is available ([[thm-induction-principle]], [[def-natural-numbers]]), and every integer $\ge 0$ is the image of a unique natural number, so a natural number may be used as an index in $\mathbb{Z}$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 For $k \in \mathbb{N}$ put $M_k := \{\, N \in \mathbb{N} : |f^{(n)} - f^{(m)}| < t^{-(k+1)} \text{ for all } n, m \ge N \,\}$. Since $t^{-(k+1)} > 0_K$ by [L3] and the sequence is Cauchy, $M_k \ne \varnothing$ by [L4]; let $N_k := \min M_k$, which exists by [L5]. [given, L3, L4, L5, construct]

2.1 For every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, all $n, m \ge N_k$ and every $j \le k$ one has $f^{(n)}(j) = f^{(m)}(j)$: by [step 1.1] $|f^{(n)} - f^{(m)}| < t^{-(k+1)}$, so [L3] gives $(f^{(n)} - f^{(m)})(j) = 0$ for every $j < k+1$, that is for every $j \le k$, and $(f^{(n)} - f^{(m)})(j) = f^{(n)}(j) - f^{(m)}(j)$ by [L2]. [step 1.1, L2, L3, L6]

2.2 $N_a \le N_b$ whenever $a \le b$ in $\mathbb{N}$: for consecutive indices, $t^{-(k+2)} < t^{-(k+1)}$ by [L3], so any $N$ witnessing membership in $M_{k+1}$ also witnesses membership in $M_k$ by transitivity of the order [L2]; hence $M_{k+1} \subseteq M_k$ and $N_k = \min M_k \le \min M_{k+1} = N_{k+1}$. The general case follows by induction on $b$ [L6]. [step 1.1, L2, L3, L6]

2.3 Define $\kappa : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{N}$ by $\kappa(j) := j$ for $j \ge 0$ and $\kappa(j) := 0$ for $j < 0$, so that $j \le \kappa(j)$ for every $j \in \mathbb{Z}$; then define $L : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R}$ by $L(j) := f^{(N_{\kappa(j)})}(j)$. [step 1.1, L6, construct]

3.1 For every $j \in \mathbb{Z}$ and every $n \ge N_{\kappa(j)}$ one has $f^{(n)}(j) = L(j)$: apply [step 2.1] with $k = \kappa(j)$, which is legitimate since $j \le \kappa(j)$, to the two indices $n$ and $N_{\kappa(j)}$, both of which are $\ge N_{\kappa(j)}$. [step 2.1, step 2.3, L6]

3.2 $L \in K$. The series $f^{(N_0)}$ lies in $K$, so by [L1] there is $m_0 \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $f^{(N_0)}(j) = 0$ for every $j < m_0$. If $j < m_0$ and $j < 0$ then $\kappa(j) = 0$, so $L(j) = f^{(N_0)}(j) = 0$; hence $L(j) = 0$ for every $j$ below both $m_0$ and $0$, the support of $L$ is bounded below, and $L \in K$. [step 2.3, L1]

4.1 For every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, every $n \ge N_k$ and every $j \le k$ one has $f^{(n)}(j) = L(j)$: if $j \ge 0$ then $\kappa(j) = j \le k$, and if $j < 0$ then $\kappa(j) = 0 \le k$, so in both cases $N_{\kappa(j)} \le N_k \le n$ by [step 2.2] and [step 3.1] applies. [step 2.2, step 3.1, L6]

5.1 $(f^{(n)})$ converges to $L$ in $K$. Let $\varepsilon > 0$ in $K$. By [L3] — this is the countable-cofinality step, and it is the only place where anything special about $K$ is used — there is $k \in \mathbb{N}$ with $t^{-k} < \varepsilon$. Put $N := N_k$. For every $n \ge N$, [step 4.1] and [L2] give $(f^{(n)} - L)(j) = f^{(n)}(j) - L(j) = 0$ for every $j \le k$, so $|f^{(n)} - L| < t^{-k}$ by [L3] and therefore $|f^{(n)} - L| < \varepsilon$ by transitivity [L2]. As $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary, this is convergence in the sense of [L4]. [step 3.2, step 4.1, L2, L3, L4]

6.1 The sequence $(f^{(n)})$ was an arbitrary Cauchy sequence in $K$, and [step 3.2] and [step 5.1] produce an element $L \in K$ to which it converges; so every Cauchy sequence in $K$ converges in $K$. [step 3.2, step 5.1, discharge-construct] ∎

## Remarks

- **What makes the argument work, in one sentence.** The value group of $K$ is $\mathbb{Z}$, whose cofinality is countable, so the continuum of thresholds $\varepsilon > 0$ in the Cauchy condition collapses to the countable family $t^{-k}$, $k \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[lem-laurent-non-archimedean]], clause 3), and a sequence indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ can meet all of them. A proof that skipped this step would be proving nothing: it is exactly the point at which the countability of the index set $\mathbb{N}$ is matched to the structure of the field.

- **Support-boundedness of the limit is a separate obligation, and it is discharged from a single threshold.** Knowing that each coefficient $f^{(n)}(j)$ is eventually constant gives a function $\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R}$ and nothing more; there is no reason *a priori* why its support should be bounded below. What supplies that is [step 3.2]: the threshold $k = 0$ freezes *all* indices $j \le 0$ simultaneously from the single stage $N_0$ onward, so $L$ agrees with the one series $f^{(N_0)}$ on the whole negative half-line and inherits its lower bound.

- **No choice is used.** The stage $N_k$ is not chosen: it is defined as the least element of $M_k$, which exists by the well-ordering principle ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]). This matters because the construction makes countably many selections, and a version of it that said "pick some $N_k$" would be an appeal to countable choice for no reason.

- **This is Cauchy completeness and nothing more.** $K$ is sequentially Cauchy complete and at the same time lacks the least-upper-bound property ([[cor-laurent-not-lub-complete]]); the two are not the same condition, and in a non-Archimedean field they come apart. Nor does this theorem give the unrestricted nested interval property: see [[cor-laurent-nested-intervals]] for what it does give, and [[cex-laurent-nested-intervals-empty]] for what it does not.

## Statement

Every complete ordered field $F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) is Archimedean:
for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$,
where $n \cdot 1_F$ is the canonical natural of the ordered field $F$
([[def-ordered-field]]). Equivalently, the canonical naturals are cofinal in $F$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $F$; write $A = \{\, n \cdot 1_F : n \ge 1 \,\}$ for the set of its canonical naturals.

[L1] Least-upper-bound property: every nonempty $S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound $\sup S \in F$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Each canonical natural satisfies $n \cdot 1_F > 0$, one has $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L3] $0 < 1_F$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $F$ is not Archimedean: there is some $x \in F$ with $n \cdot 1_F \le x$ for all $n \ge 1$, that is, $x$ is an upper bound of $A$. [assume-contra]

2.1 The set $A$ is nonempty, since $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F \in A$, and it is bounded above by $x$. [step 1.1, L2]

3.1 By the least-upper-bound property, $A$ has a least upper bound $s = \sup A \in F$. [step 2.1, L1]

4.1 Since $1_F > 0$, we have $s - 1_F < s$; as $s$ is the least upper bound, $s - 1_F$ is not an upper bound of $A$. [step 3.1, L3]

5.1 Hence there is some $m \ge 1$ with $m \cdot 1_F > s - 1_F$. [step 4.1]

6.1 Adding $1_F$ to both sides, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F > s$. [step 5.1, L2]

7.1 But $(m+1) \cdot 1_F \in A$, so $(m+1) \cdot 1_F \le s$ because $s$ is an upper bound of $A$, contradicting 6.1. [step 6.1, step 3.1, L2]

8.1 The assumption is therefore untenable, so $F$ is Archimedean. [step 7.1, discharge-contradiction] ∎
