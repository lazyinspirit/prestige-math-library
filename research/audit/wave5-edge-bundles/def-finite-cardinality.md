`items/def-finite-cardinality.md` — definition — The cardinality $\\lvert A\\rvert$ of a finite set

#### Definition

Throughout this page $\mathbb{N}$ is the set of von Neumann naturals
([[def-natural-numbers]]): $0 = \varnothing$, $\sigma(n) = n \cup \{n\}$, and
$n = \{\, m \in \mathbb{N} : m < n \,\}$ is itself the set of its predecessors,
the order being the additive order of [[def-nat-order]] identified with
membership in [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]. Write $A \approx B$ when a
bijection $A \to B$ exists ([[def-equinumerous]],
[[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]). A set $A$ is **finite** when
$A \approx n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-countable]]).

**Definition.** Let $A$ be a finite set. Then there is **exactly one**
$n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $A \approx n$, and we write

$$\lvert A\rvert := \text{that } n,$$

the **cardinality**, or number of elements, of $A$. The notation $\lvert A\rvert$
is defined for finite $A$ only, and its value is a natural number.

**Why exactly one, which is the whole content of the definition.** At least one
such $n$ exists: that is literally what "$A$ is finite" says. At most one exists:
if $A \approx n$ and $A \approx m$ with $n, m \in \mathbb{N}$, then $n \approx A$,
because the inverse of a bijection is a bijection, and hence $n \approx m$,
because a composition of bijections is a bijection
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]); and $n \approx m$ forces $n = m$ by
claim 3 of [[lem-pigeonhole]]. So $\lvert A\rvert$ names a single natural number
and not a family of choices.

**Four consequences, proved here because everything on this page uses them.**

**(a) $\lvert n\rvert = n$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$.** The identity map
$\mathrm{id}_n$ is a bijection $n \to n$, so $n \approx n$; thus $n$ is finite and
the unique natural equinumerous with it is $n$ itself.

**(b) $\lvert\varnothing\rvert = 0$, and a finite $A$ satisfies
$\lvert A\rvert = 0$ if and only if $A = \varnothing$.** Since $0 = \varnothing$,
part (a) gives $\lvert\varnothing\rvert = 0$. Conversely, if $\lvert A\rvert = 0$
then there is a bijection $f : A \to \varnothing$; were some $a \in A$, the value
$f(a)$ would be an element of $\varnothing$, and $\varnothing$ has none, so
$A = \varnothing$.

**(c) Transport along a bijection.** If $A$ is finite and $f : A \to B$ is a
bijection, then $B$ is finite and $\lvert B\rvert = \lvert A\rvert$. Indeed
$B \approx A$ through $f^{-1}$ and $A \approx \lvert A\rvert$, so
$B \approx \lvert A\rvert$ by transitivity.

**(d) Equality of cardinalities is equinumerosity.** For finite $A$ and $B$:
$\lvert A\rvert = \lvert B\rvert$ if and only if $A \approx B$. If the
cardinalities agree then $A \approx \lvert A\rvert = \lvert B\rvert \approx B$;
conversely $A \approx B$ gives $\lvert B\rvert = \lvert A\rvert$ by (c).
