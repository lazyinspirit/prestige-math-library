`items/lem-limit-unique.md` — lemma — A sequence has at most one limit

#### Statement

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]) and let $x, y \in
\mathbb{R}$. If $(x_k)$ converges to $x$ and $(x_k)$ converges to $y$
([[def-real-limit]]), then $x = y$. A sequence therefore has at most one limit,
and when a limit exists it may be denoted $\lim_{k} x_k$.
