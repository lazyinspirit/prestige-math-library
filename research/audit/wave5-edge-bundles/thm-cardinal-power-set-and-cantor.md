`items/thm-cardinal-power-set-and-cantor.md` — theorem — Assuming the Axiom of Choice, $2^{\\kappa} = \\lvert \\mathcal{P}(\\kappa) \\rvert$, and Cantor's theorem in cardinal form: $\\kappa < 2^{\\kappa}$

#### Statement

**Assume the Axiom of Choice** ([[def-axiom-of-choice]]), so that every set has a
cardinality ([[thm-well-ordering-theorem]],
[[lem-cardinality-of-a-well-orderable-set]]). Let $\kappa$ be a cardinal
([[def-cardinal]]) and read $2 = \{0,1\}$ as a cardinal. Then:

**(a)** $2^{\kappa} = \lvert \mathcal{P}(\kappa) \rvert$
([[def-cardinal-arithmetic]]), and more generally
$2^{\lvert A \rvert} = \lvert \mathcal{P}(A) \rvert$ for every set $A$;

**(b)** $\kappa < 2^{\kappa}$.

Clause (b) is [[thm-cantor-powerset]] transcribed into cardinal arithmetic. The
underlying combinatorial fact — that there is no surjection $A \to \mathcal{P}(A)$
— is a theorem of ZF and needs no choice at all; what the Axiom of Choice buys
here is only the right to write $\lvert \mathcal{P}(A) \rvert$ and $2^{\kappa}$
as cardinals in the first place.
