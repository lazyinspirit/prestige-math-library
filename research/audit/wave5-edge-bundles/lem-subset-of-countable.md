`items/lem-subset-of-countable.md` — lemma — Every subset of an at most countable set is at most countable

#### Statement

Let $A$ be at most countable ([[def-countable]]) and let $B \subseteq A$. Then
$B$ is at most countable.

The proof establishes the sharper statement about subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ from
which this follows: **a subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is finite if it is
bounded above, and countably infinite if it is not.**

**No choice principle is used.** This is the point of the lemma rather than a
footnote to it. The enumeration of an unbounded $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is built
by always taking the *least* element of $S$ above the previous one, and the least
element of a nonempty set of naturals is canonical
([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]): it is determined by $S$, not selected from it.
Replacing "least" by "some" would turn the construction into an appeal to
dependent choice.
