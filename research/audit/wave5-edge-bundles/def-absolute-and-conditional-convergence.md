`items/def-absolute-and-conditional-convergence.md` — definition — Absolutely convergent and conditionally convergent series, and the general starting index

#### Definition

Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals, with series $\sum a_k$ and partial sums
$s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ as in [[def-series]], and let $|x|$ be the absolute value
([[def-abs-value]]).

**Absolute convergence.** The series $\sum a_k$ **converges absolutely** when the
series $\sum |a_k|$ converges ([[def-series]]). Since $|a_k| \ge 0$ for every $k$
([[lem-of-abs-value]]), this is a statement about a series of nonnegative terms.

**Conditional convergence.** The series $\sum a_k$ **converges conditionally**
when it converges ([[def-series]], [[def-real-limit]]) and does *not* converge
absolutely.

So a convergent series is exactly one of the two: absolutely convergent or
conditionally convergent, according as $\sum |a_k|$ converges or not.

**One implication is already proved, and is not reproved anywhere on this page.**
[[lem-absolute-convergence-implies-convergence]] states that if $\sum |a_k|$
converges then $\sum a_k$ converges. That lemma was coined and proved on the
previous page of this track, where the root and ratio tests need it; this page
names it and builds on it. In particular an absolutely convergent series is a
convergent series, so the two words above really do partition the convergent
series, and "conditionally convergent" is not vacuous by accident: the alternating
harmonic series is a witness, and the witness is exhibited in
[[fs-convergent-implies-absolutely-convergent]].

**General starting index.** Let $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $(a_k)_{k \ge m}$ be a
family from $m$ ([[def-series]]). The series $\sum_{k \ge m} a_k$ **converges
absolutely** when $\sum_{k \ge m} |a_k|$ converges, and **converges
conditionally** when it converges and does not converge absolutely. By
[[def-series]] both statements are the corresponding statements for the shifted
sequence $j \mapsto a_{j+m}$, so nothing new is being defined and every result
below transfers to a general starting index in the same way, exactly as
[[lem-absolute-convergence-implies-convergence]] already records for the one
implication it proves.

Title: Assuming countable choice, a real family is summable as a finite-subset net if and only if it has at most countable support and its nonzero terms are absolutely summable; its sum is independent of the enumeration

- [L5] A real series is absolutely convergent exactly when the series of absolute values converges; sums over finite index sets are invariant under their enumerations ([[def-absolute-and-conditional-convergence]], [[def-sum-over-a-finite-index-set]]).
