`items/lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r.md` — lemma — Both $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Q}$ are dense in $\\mathbb{R}$, and every nonempty open subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable

#### Statement

Write $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the image of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$
under the canonical embedding $q \mapsto \hat q$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), the
set usually written $\mathbb{Q}$ once the identification is made, and put
$X := \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the irrationals. Then:

1. $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$, that is,
   $\overline{\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}} = \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]);
2. $X$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$;
3. every nonempty open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable
   ([[def-countable]]).

Claim 2 is not a symmetry of claim 1: the rationals are dense because they are
*constructed* to approximate, whereas the irrationals are dense because there are
too many points in any interval for a countable set to exhaust it, which is why
claim 3 is proved alongside and used for it.

Title: $\\mathbb{Q}^n$ is a countable dense subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$, and rational open boxes form a countable basis

- [L2] Every nonempty open subset of $\mathbb R$ contains a rational point ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]).
