`items/def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps.md` — definition — Homeomorphism, open map, closed map, embedding, and what it means for a property to be topological

#### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be topological spaces and let
$f : X \to Y$ be a function. Continuity is as in [[def-continuous-map-top]],
injections, surjections and bijections as in
[[def-injection-surjection-bijection]].

- $f$ is an **open map** if $f[U]$ is open in $Y$ for every open $U \subseteq X$.
- $f$ is a **closed map** if $f[F]$ is closed in $Y$ for every closed
  $F \subseteq X$.
- $f$ is a **homeomorphism** if $f$ is a continuous bijection whose inverse
  $f^{-1} : Y \to X$ is also continuous. The spaces are **homeomorphic**, written
  $X \cong Y$, when a homeomorphism $X \to Y$ exists.
- $f$ is an **embedding** if $f$ is injective and the corestriction
  $f_0 : X \to f[X]$, $f_0(x) = f(x)$, is a homeomorphism onto $f[X]$ carrying
  the subspace topology inherited from $Y$ ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]).

**The inverse in the third clause exists because $f$ is a bijection**, and it is
the unique two-sided inverse ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]); no choice
principle is involved. Continuity of $f^{-1}$ is a genuine additional demand: a
continuous bijection need not be a homeomorphism, and this page records that
failure as a false statement with a two-point witness.

**Open, closed and homeomorphism are three different conditions.** A
homeomorphism is continuous by definition, but an open map need not be continuous
and a closed map need not be continuous; and continuity implies neither openness
nor closedness. An open map need
not be closed and a closed map need not be open, and Sierpinski space
$S = \{a,b\}$ with open point $b$ ([[def-standard-topologies]]) witnesses both
failures at once: the constant map $S \to S$ with value $b$ is open, since the
image of every nonempty set is the open set $\{b\}$, and is not closed, since the
image of the closed set $\{a\}$ is $\{b\}$, whose complement $\{a\}$ is not open;
the constant map with value $a$ is closed and not open by the same computation
read the other way. What is true
is that for a **continuous bijection** the three notions collapse: it is a
homeomorphism exactly when it is open, exactly when it is closed. That is proved
in the next item and is not assumed here.

**Topological properties.** A **property of topological spaces** is a condition
$P$ that is either true or false of each space. $P$ is a **topological property**
(one is also said to be *preserved by homeomorphism*, or *invariant*) when
$X \cong Y$ implies that $P(X)$ and $P(Y)$ have the same truth value. Since
$\cong$ is an equivalence relation on spaces — the identity is a homeomorphism,
inverses and composites of homeomorphisms are homeomorphisms, all three verified
in the next item — a topological property is exactly one that is constant on each
$\cong$-class.

**What a homeomorphism transports.** If $h : X \to Y$ is a homeomorphism then
$U \mapsto h[U]$ is a bijection from $\mathcal{T}_X$ onto $\mathcal{T}_Y$, with
inverse $V \mapsto h^{-1}[V]$: both maps are well defined because $h$ and
$h^{-1}$ are continuous, and they are mutually inverse because $h$ is a
bijection. So a homeomorphism is an isomorphism of the structure "a set together
with a distinguished family of subsets", and every notion defined from the open
sets alone — closed, closure, interior, boundary, dense, convergence of
sequences, continuity of maps into and out of the space — is carried across by
it. Anything defined from extra data, such as a metric or an order, is not, and
that distinction is exactly what the phrase *topological property* is for.
