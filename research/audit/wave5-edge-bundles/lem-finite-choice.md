`items/lem-finite-choice.md` — lemma — Every natural-number-indexed list of nonempty sets has a choice function on its family of values

#### Statement

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $F$ be a function with domain $n$ all of whose
values are nonempty sets. Then the family of its values,
$\mathcal{F} = F[n] = \{\, F(i) : i \in n \,\}$, has a choice function
([[def-choice-function]]).

This is a theorem of ZF: its proof uses no form of the Axiom of Choice
([[def-axiom-of-choice]]).

What is proved below is exactly the displayed statement, by induction on $n$. The
natural number $n$ serves as the index set in the von Neumann sense,
$n = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]), so "$F$ has domain $n$"
says precisely that the members of $\mathcal{F}$ are listed as
$F(0), \dots, F(n-1)$. The listing need not be injective, and $\mathcal{F}$ is the
set of values, so repetitions are harmless and are not counted.

The displayed statement and its proof use only a natural-number-indexed
function. They do not identify an arbitrary finite family with a particular
enumeration.
