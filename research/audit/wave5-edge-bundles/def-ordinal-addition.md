`items/def-ordinal-addition.md` — definition — Ordinal addition $\\alpha + \\beta$

#### Definition

Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be ordinals ([[def-ordinal]]). The **sum**
$\alpha + \beta$ is defined by recursion on $\beta$, in the three cases of
[[def-limit-ordinal]]:

$$\alpha + 0 = \alpha, \qquad \alpha + \beta^{+} = (\alpha + \beta)^{+}, \qquad \alpha + \lambda = \bigcup\{\, \alpha + \beta : \beta \in \lambda \,\} \quad (\lambda \text{ a limit ordinal}).$$

That exactly one operation satisfies these three clauses, and that all its
values are ordinals, is [[cor-ordinal-addition-well-defined]], proved
immediately above. The union in the limit clause is the least upper bound of the
values already produced (claim (e) of [[lem-ordinal-basics]]), so it may be
written $\sup$ and the clause read as "at a limit, take the supremum".

**Notation.** We write $1 = 0^{+}$, $2 = 1^{+}$, and so on for the finite
ordinals, and $\sup$ for $\bigcup$ applied to a set of ordinals. The successor
operation is now a special case of addition:

$$\alpha + 1 = \alpha + 0^{+} = (\alpha + 0)^{+} = \alpha^{+},$$

so from here on $\alpha + 1$ and $\alpha^{+}$ denote the same ordinal, and both
notations are used, whichever reads better.

Title: Refuted, assuming countable choice: every Hausdorff space built from ordinal spaces is normal. The deleted Tychonoff plank $((\\omega_1 + 1) \\times (\\omega + 1)) \\setminus \\{(\\omega_1, \\omega)\\}$ is Hausdorff and not normal

- [L1] $\alpha + 1 = \alpha^{+}$; $\omega$ and $\omega_1$ are limit ordinals; $\omega_1$ is uncountable and every ordinal below it is at most countable ([[def-ordinal-addition]], [[lem-omega-least-limit-ordinal]], [[def-limit-ordinal]], [[thm-omega-one-is-the-least-uncountable-ordinal]], [[def-first-uncountable-ordinal]], [[def-countable]]).

### `ex-the-ordinal-spaces-omega-plus-one-and-omega-one` (published-backward, page separation-axioms-examples)

Title: $\\omega + 1$ as a convergent sequence together with its limit, and, assuming countable choice, $[0, \\omega_1)$, in which every sequence lies inside an at most countable initial segment

- ([[def-ordinal-addition]]), $\omega + 1 = \omega^{+} = \omega \cup \{\omega\}$,
- [A2] $\alpha + 1 = \alpha^{+}$, by the clauses of ordinal addition at $0$ and at a successor ([[def-ordinal-addition]]).
