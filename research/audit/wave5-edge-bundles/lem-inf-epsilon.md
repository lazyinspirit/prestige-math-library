`items/lem-inf-epsilon.md` — lemma — Epsilon characterisation of the infimum

#### Statement

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be nonempty and bounded below, and let $\ell$ be a
lower bound of $S$ ([[def-bounded-set]]). Then

$$\ell = \inf S \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \text{for every } \varepsilon > 0 \text{ there exists } s \in S \text{ with } s < \ell + \varepsilon.$$

In words: among the lower bounds of $S$, the infimum is exactly the one that
cannot be raised by any positive amount and still bound $S$ from below.

Title: A nondecreasing sequence bounded above converges to the supremum of its range, and a nonincreasing sequence bounded below to the infimum

- [L4] Epsilon characterisation of the infimum: if $\ell$ is a lower bound of a nonempty $T$, then $\ell = \inf T$ exactly when for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $t \in T$ with $t < \ell + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-inf-epsilon]]).
- out because it is no longer, and because it puts [[lem-inf-epsilon]] to work in

### `thm-uniform-limit-theorem` (published-backward, page function-space-topologies)

Title: A uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous, so $C(X,Y)$ is closed in $Y^{X}$ under the uniform metric

- [L6] If $\inf S = 0$ and $\eta > 0$ is real, then some $s \in S$ satisfies $s < \eta$ ([[lem-inf-epsilon]], [[def-infimum]]).
