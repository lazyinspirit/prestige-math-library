`items/thm-compact-subset-of-a-hausdorff-space-is-closed.md` — theorem — In a Hausdorff space a point and a disjoint compact set, and two disjoint compact sets, have disjoint open neighbourhoods; hence every compact subset is closed, and in a compact Hausdorff space the compact subsets are exactly the closed ones

#### Statement

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a Hausdorff topological space
([[def-hausdorff-space]], [[def-topological-space]]), with compact subsets as in
[[def-compact-space]]. Then:

1. **A point and a disjoint compact set are separated.** If $K \subseteq X$ is
   compact and $x \in X \setminus K$, there are $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$ with
   $$x \in U, \qquad K \subseteq V, \qquad U \cap V = \varnothing .$$
2. **Two disjoint compact sets are separated.** If $K, L \subseteq X$ are compact
   and $K \cap L = \varnothing$, there are $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$ with
   $$L \subseteq U, \qquad K \subseteq V, \qquad U \cap V = \varnothing .$$
3. **Compact implies closed.** Every compact subset of $X$ is closed in $X$.
4. **In a compact Hausdorff space the two classes coincide.** If in addition
   $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is compact, then a subset of $X$ is compact if and only if
   it is closed.

**The proof is written choice-free, and that is not a stylistic preference.** The
textbook argument says "for each $y \in K$ choose disjoint open $U_y, V_y$",
which is a selection over an arbitrary index set and therefore an appeal to the
full Axiom of Choice. What is done below instead is to take the family of **all**
open $V$ that admit some open $U \ni x$ disjoint from them — a family cut out by
a formula, with nothing selected — extract a finite subcover from it, and only
then make finitely many selections, which [[lem-finite-choice]] supplies as a
theorem of ZF.
