`items/def-isometry-and-metric-embedding.md` — definition — Isometry, isometric embedding, and the subspace metric on a subset

#### Definition

Let $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ be metric spaces ([[def-metric-space]]).

**Isometric embedding and isometry.** A function $f : X \to Y$ is an
**isometric embedding** if

$$d_Y\big(f(x), f(x')\big) = d_X(x,x') \qquad \text{for all } x, x' \in X ,$$

and an **isometry** if it is in addition bijective
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]). Two metric spaces are **isometric** if
some isometry between them exists.

**Subspace metric.** Let $A \subseteq X$ and let

$$d_A := d_X \restriction (A \times A)$$

be the restriction of $d_X$ to pairs from $A$. Then $d_A$ is a metric on $A$:
the three axioms (M1), (M2), (M3) of [[def-metric-space]] are conditions on
triples of points, and each holds for points of $A$ because it holds for points
of $X$. The pair $(A, d_A)$ is the **metric subspace** $A$ of $X$, and the
inclusion $A \to X$ is an isometric embedding by construction. The metric
topology of $d_A$ ([[def-metric-topology]]) is the **subspace topology** of $A$.

**Balls of a subspace are traces of balls of the ambient space.** For $a \in A$
and $r > 0$,

$$B_A(a,r) = B_X(a,r) \cap A ,$$

directly from the definitions: a point $z$ lies in the left side exactly when
$z \in A$ and $d_A(a,z) = d_X(a,z) < r$ ([[def-metric-ball]]). This is why the
ambient space is always written into the ball notation, and it is the source of
every apparent paradox about balls in subspaces.
