`items/def-dense-top.md` — definition — Dense, nowhere dense and codense subsets of a topological space, and the criterion by basic open sets

#### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, let $\mathcal{B}$ be a basis for
$\mathcal{T}$ ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]) and let $A \subseteq X$. Interior
and closure are as in [[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]].

- $A$ is **dense** in $X$ if $\overline{A} = X$.
- $A$ is **codense** in $X$ if $X \setminus A$ is dense.
- $A$ is **nowhere dense** in $X$ if $\operatorname{int}(\overline{A}) = \varnothing$.

**Three equivalent forms of density, and the one used in practice.** The
following are equivalent:

1. $\overline{A} = X$;
2. $U \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every nonempty open $U \subseteq X$;
3. $B \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every nonempty $B \in \mathcal{B}$.

*Proof.* (1) $\Rightarrow$ (2): if $U$ is open and nonempty, pick $x \in U$; then
$x \in \overline{A}$, so $U \cap A \ne \varnothing$ by clause (c) of
[[thm-closure-characterisation-top]]. (2) $\Rightarrow$ (3): a nonempty member of
$\mathcal{B}$ is a nonempty open set. (3) $\Rightarrow$ (1): let $x \in X$; every
$B \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B$ is nonempty and so meets $A$, hence
$x \in \overline{A}$ by clause (d) of [[thm-closure-characterisation-top]]. Form
3 is what makes density checkable: for the Sorgenfrey line it is a statement
about half-open intervals, and for a metric space a statement about balls.

**Codensity is emptiness of the interior.** $A$ is codense if and only if
$\operatorname{int}(A) = \varnothing$, because
$X \setminus \operatorname{int}(A) = \overline{X \setminus A}$
([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]), so $\overline{X \setminus A} = X$ holds
exactly when $\operatorname{int}(A) = \varnothing$.

**Nowhere dense implies codense, and the converse fails.** If
$\operatorname{int}(\overline{A}) = \varnothing$ then
$\operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq \operatorname{int}(\overline{A}) = \varnothing$
by monotonicity of the interior, so $A$ is codense. The two notions can differ
only on sets whose closure is larger than themselves, and there they sometimes
do: a dense set with empty interior, such as the rationals inside the real line,
is codense and is not nowhere dense, its closure being everything. They may also
agree on such a set: $(0,1)$ inside $\mathbb{R}$ has closure $[0,1]$ and is
neither codense nor nowhere dense. A *closed* set is nowhere dense
precisely when it is codense, since then $\overline{A} = A$.

### `def-separable-space` (published-backward, page countability-axioms-and-cardinal-functions)

Title: Separability: the existence of an at most countable dense subset

- A topological space $X$ is **separable** if some at most countable subset $D\subseteq X$ is dense in $X$ ([[def-dense-top]], [[def-countable]]). Equivalently, every nonempty open subset of $X$ meets $D$.

### `def-weight-density-and-character` (published-backward, page countability-axioms-and-cardinal-functions)

Title: Under choice, weight $w(X)$, density $d(X)$, local character $\\chi(x,X)$, and character $\\chi(X)$ as raw cardinal minima and a supremum

- Assume the Axiom of Choice ([[def-axiom-of-choice]]) and let $X$ be a topological space. The **weight** $w(X)$ is the least cardinality of a basis for $X$, and the **density** $d(X)$ is the least cardinality of a dense subset of $X$ ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]], [[def-dense-top]], [[def-cardinal]]).
