`items/thm-rationals-countable.md` — theorem — $\\mathbb{Q}$ is countably infinite

#### Statement

$\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-equinumerous]]): the rationals are
countably infinite ([[def-countable]]).

**No choice principle is used.** The one place where a reader expects a choice,
"pick a representative $a/b$ of each rational", is exactly where
[[lem-rat-positive-denominator]] applies: every rational *has* a representative
with positive denominator, so the map $(a,b) \mapsto [(a,b)]$ defined on
$\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ is already **surjective** onto $\mathbb{Q}$,
and countability follows from a surjection without ever selecting a
representative. The same device handles $\mathbb{Z}$, which is a surjective image
of $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ by construction ([[def-integers]]).
