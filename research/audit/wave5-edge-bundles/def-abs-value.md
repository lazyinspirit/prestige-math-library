`items/def-abs-value.md` — definition — Absolute value in an ordered field

#### Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]). The **absolute value** of
$x \in F$ is

$$|x| \;:=\; \begin{cases} x & \text{if } x \ge 0, \\ -x & \text{if } x < 0. \end{cases}$$

Title: FALSE: a pointwise convergent sequence of continuous functions converges uniformly on every compact set

- [L3] An affine map $t \mapsto ct + e$ of $\mathbb{R}$ is Lipschitz with constant $|c|$, hence uniformly continuous, hence continuous; and the restriction of a continuous map to a metric subspace is continuous ([[def-lipschitz-holder-contraction]], [[thm-metric-regularity-hierarchy]], [[def-metric-continuity]], [[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]], [[def-abs-value]]).
