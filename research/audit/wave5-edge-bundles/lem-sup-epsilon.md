`items/lem-sup-epsilon.md` — lemma — Epsilon characterisation of the supremum

#### Statement

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be nonempty and bounded above, and let $u$ be an
upper bound of $S$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]). Then

$$u = \sup S \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \text{for every } \varepsilon > 0 \text{ there exists } s \in S \text{ with } u - \varepsilon < s.$$

In words: among the upper bounds of $S$, the supremum is exactly the one that
cannot be lowered by any positive amount and still bound $S$.

Title: A nondecreasing sequence bounded above converges to the supremum of its range, and a nonincreasing sequence bounded below to the infimum

- [L3] Epsilon characterisation of the supremum: if $u$ is an upper bound of a nonempty $S$, then $u = \sup S$ exactly when for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $s \in S$ with $u - \varepsilon < s$ ([[lem-sup-epsilon]]).
- identification is what [[lem-sup-epsilon]] supplies and it is the useful part
