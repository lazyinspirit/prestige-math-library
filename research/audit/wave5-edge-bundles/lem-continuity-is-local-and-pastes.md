`items/lem-continuity-is-local-and-pastes.md` — lemma — Continuity may be checked on any open cover, and on any finite closed cover; composites of continuous maps are continuous

#### Statement

Let $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ be topological spaces, with subspaces carrying the subspace
topology ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]). Then:

1. **Composites.** If $f : X \to Y$ and $g : Y \to Z$ are continuous
   ([[def-continuous-map-top]]) then $g \circ f : X \to Z$ is continuous.
2. **Open cover.** Let $f : X \to Y$ be a function and let
   $\{\, U_i : i \in I \,\}$ be a family of open subsets of $X$ with
   $\bigcup_{i \in I} U_i = X$. If $f|_{U_i} : U_i \to Y$ is continuous for every
   $i \in I$, then $f$ is continuous.
3. **Finite closed cover.** Let $f : X \to Y$ be a function, let $n \ge 1$ and
   let $F_1, \dots, F_n$ be closed subsets of $X$ with
   $F_1 \cup \dots \cup F_n = X$. If $f|_{F_k} : F_k \to Y$ is continuous for
   every $k$, then $f$ is continuous.

The converses of claims 2 and 3 hold with no hypothesis on the cover at all:
every restriction of a continuous map to a subspace is continuous
([[def-subspace-topology-top]]). The finiteness in claim 3 is not removable; see
the remarks.
