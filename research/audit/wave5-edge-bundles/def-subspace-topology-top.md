`items/def-subspace-topology-top.md` — definition — Subspace topology: the traces of the open sets, its closed sets and its bases, the continuity of the inclusion, and the characteristic property of a map into a subspace

#### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]) and let
$S \subseteq X$. The **subspace topology** (also *relative topology*) on $S$ is

$$\mathcal{T}_S := \{\, U \cap S : U \in \mathcal{T} \,\},$$

the family of **traces** on $S$ of the open sets of $X$. The pair
$(S, \mathcal{T}_S)$ is a **subspace** of $X$. A subset of $S$ that lies in
$\mathcal{T}_S$ is said to be **open in $S$**, and *relatively open* where the
ambient space needs emphasis.

**$\mathcal{T}_S$ is a topology, and this is discharged here.** (T1):
$\varnothing = \varnothing \cap S$ and $S = X \cap S$ are traces. (T2): if
$\mathcal{S}' \subseteq \mathcal{T}_S$, choose for each member a set of
$\mathcal{T}$ tracing to it — no choice principle is needed, since
$U' := \bigcup \{\, U \in \mathcal{T} : U \cap S \subseteq W \,\}$ is a canonical
such set for $W \in \mathcal{T}_S$, being open by (T2) in $X$ and satisfying
$U' \cap S = W$ — and then
$\bigcup_i (U_i \cap S) = (\bigcup_i U_i) \cap S \in \mathcal{T}_S$ by (T2) in
$X$. (T3): $(U \cap S) \cap (V \cap S) = (U \cap V) \cap S \in \mathcal{T}_S$ by
(T3) in $X$.

**Closed sets of a subspace are the traces of the closed sets.** A set
$C \subseteq S$ is closed in $S$ if and only if $C = F \cap S$ for some closed
$F \subseteq X$. Indeed $S \setminus (U \cap S) = (X \setminus U) \cap S$ and
$S \setminus (F \cap S) = (X \setminus F) \cap S$, so complementation inside $S$
matches complementation inside $X$ under tracing.

**Bases and subbases trace as well.** If $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for
$\mathcal{T}$ ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]) then
$\mathcal{B}_S := \{\, B \cap S : B \in \mathcal{B} \,\}$ is a basis for
$\mathcal{T}_S$: its members are open in $S$, and for $W = U \cap S$ open in $S$
and $x \in W$ there is $B \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B \subseteq U$, whence
$x \in B \cap S \subseteq W$. The same computation with a subbasis $\mathcal{S}$
shows that $\{\, S_0 \cap S : S_0 \in \mathcal{S} \,\}$ is a subbasis for
$\mathcal{T}_S$, since tracing commutes with finite intersections and with
unions.

**The inclusion is continuous.** The inclusion map $\iota : S \to X$,
$\iota(s) = s$, satisfies $\iota^{-1}[U] = U \cap S$ for every $U \subseteq X$,
so preimages of open sets are open and $\iota$ is continuous
([[thm-continuity-characterisations-top]], clause (b)). Moreover
$\mathcal{T}_S$ is the **coarsest** topology on $S$ making $\iota$ continuous: any
topology on $S$ for which $\iota$ is continuous must contain every
$\iota^{-1}[U] = U \cap S$, hence contain $\mathcal{T}_S$.

**Characteristic property of a map into a subspace.** Let $(Z, \mathcal{T}_Z)$ be
a topological space and let $g : Z \to S$ be a function. Then

$$g \text{ is continuous as a map } Z \to (S,\mathcal{T}_S) \iff \iota \circ g \text{ is continuous as a map } Z \to (X,\mathcal{T}) .$$

*Proof.* For $U \in \mathcal{T}$ one has
$(\iota \circ g)^{-1}[U] = g^{-1}[\iota^{-1}[U]] = g^{-1}[U \cap S]$. If $g$ is
continuous then each $g^{-1}[U \cap S]$ is open, so $\iota \circ g$ is continuous;
conversely if $\iota \circ g$ is continuous then for any $W = U \cap S$ open in
$S$ the set $g^{-1}[W] = (\iota \circ g)^{-1}[U]$ is open, so $g$ is continuous.
Both directions use only clause (b) of [[thm-continuity-characterisations-top]].

**Restriction of a continuous map.** If $f : X \to Y$ is continuous and
$S \subseteq X$, then $f|_S : S \to Y$ is continuous, since
$(f|_S)^{-1}[V] = f^{-1}[V] \cap S$ is open in $S$ for every open $V \subseteq Y$
([[def-continuous-map-top]], [[thm-continuity-characterisations-top]]).

**When relative and ambient agree.** If $S$ is open in $X$ then a subset of $S$
is open in $S$ if and only if it is open in $X$: a trace $U \cap S$ is then an
intersection of two open sets of $X$, and conversely an open subset of $X$
contained in $S$ is its own trace. The same statement with "closed" throughout
holds when $S$ is closed in $X$. Both are used in the pasting lemma of the next
item, and both fail without the hypothesis: $S$ itself is always open and closed
in $S$, and need be neither in $X$.
