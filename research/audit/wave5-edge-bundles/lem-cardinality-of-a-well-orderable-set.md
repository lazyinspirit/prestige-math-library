`items/lem-cardinality-of-a-well-orderable-set.md` — lemma — A set equinumerous with some ordinal has a least such ordinal, that ordinal is a cardinal, and equinumerous sets get the same one; no choice principle is used

#### Statement

Call a set $X$ **well-orderable** when some relation well-orders it
([[def-well-order]]). Work in ZF, with no choice principle. Then:

**(a)** $X$ is well-orderable if and only if $X \approx \alpha$
([[def-equinumerous]]) for some ordinal $\alpha$ ([[def-ordinal]]).

**(b)** If $X$ is well-orderable there is a **least** ordinal equinumerous with
$X$. It is written $\lvert X \rvert$ and called the **cardinality** of $X$.

**(c)** $\lvert X \rvert$ is a cardinal ([[def-cardinal]]).

**(d)** If $X \approx Y$ and $X$ is well-orderable, then $Y$ is well-orderable
and $\lvert Y \rvert = \lvert X \rvert$.

**(e)** $\lvert \alpha \rvert \le \alpha$ for every ordinal $\alpha$, and
$\lvert \alpha \rvert = \alpha$ exactly when $\alpha$ is a cardinal.

Assuming the Axiom of Choice ([[def-axiom-of-choice]]) every set is
well-orderable ([[thm-well-ordering-theorem]]), so $\lvert X \rvert$ is then
defined for every set and is exactly the cardinality of [[def-cardinal]].

**Why this item exists.** [[def-cardinal]] introduces $\lvert X \rvert$ under the
hypothesis "Assume the Axiom of Choice", and it needs that hypothesis only to
know that $X$ carries a well-order at all. Everything below is about
well-orderable sets and is a theorem of ZF, which is what makes it possible to
state Hessenberg's theorem and Tarski's theorem, one of which is choice-free and
the other of which is precisely about the gap between ZF and ZFC.

Title: Under choice, $c(X)$ is a well-defined cardinal

- [L1] Under choice every family has a cardinality ([[thm-well-ordering-theorem]], [[lem-cardinality-of-a-well-orderable-set]]).

### `lem-character-is-well-defined` (published-backward, page countability-axioms-and-cardinal-functions)

Title: Under choice, $\\chi(x,X)$ and $\\chi(X)$ are well-defined cardinals

- [L1] Under choice every set can be well ordered and therefore has a cardinality ([[thm-well-ordering-theorem]], [[lem-cardinality-of-a-well-orderable-set]]).
