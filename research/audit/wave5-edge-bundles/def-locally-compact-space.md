#### Definition

A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ ([[def-topological-space]]) is **locally
compact** when

> every point of $X$ has a compact neighbourhood:

that is, for every $x \in X$ there is a neighbourhood $N$ of $x$
([[def-neighbourhood-top]]) that is a compact subset of $X$
([[def-compact-space]], [[def-subspace-topology-top]]).

**A neighbourhood need not be open here**, and that is what makes the condition
the weak one it is meant to be: $N$ is required only to contain some open set
containing $x$. Writing "compact **open** neighbourhood" instead would define a
strictly stronger property, satisfied by no space in which a point has no compact
open neighbourhood, $\mathbb{R}$ among them; and requiring the compact set merely
to *contain* $x$ would define a property so weak that every space with a
singleton has it, singletons being compact.

**Every compact space is locally compact**, since $X$ itself is a neighbourhood
of each of its points and is a compact subset of itself. The converse fails, and
$\mathbb{R}^n$ is the standard witness.

**What the condition says in a metric space.** Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space
carrying its metric topology ([[def-metric-topology]], [[def-metrizable-space]]),
with balls as in [[def-metric-ball]], and let $x \in X$. Then

> $x$ has a compact neighbourhood **if and only if** there are a real $r > 0$ and
> a compact $K \subseteq X$ with $B(x,r) \subseteq K$.

*Both directions are immediate and are discharged here.* If $N$ is a compact
neighbourhood of $x$, fix an open $U$ with $x \in U \subseteq N$; by
[[def-metric-topology]] there is $r > 0$ with $B(x,r) \subseteq U \subseteq N$, so
$K := N$ serves. Conversely, if $B(x,r) \subseteq K$ with $K$ compact, then $K$
contains the open set $B(x,r)$, which contains $x$, so $K$ is a neighbourhood of
$x$ and is compact. Compactness of a subset of $(X,d)$ means the same thing read
metrically and read topologically
([[thm-compactness-agrees-with-metric-compactness]]), so the criterion may be
applied with either development's theorems.

**$\mathbb{R}^n$ is locally compact for every $n \ge 1$.** Give $\mathbb{R}^n$
the product topology, which is the metric topology of the Euclidean metric $d_2$
([[lem-metrics-on-rn]], [[cor-heine-borel-in-the-product-topology]]). For
$p \in \mathbb{R}^n$ the set

$$Q_p \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R}^n : d_2(x,p) \le 1 \,\}$$

is closed, being the complement of the union of the open balls $B(y, d_2(y,p) - 1)$
over the points $y$ with $d_2(y,p) > 1$, and it is bounded
([[def-metric-bounded-diameter]]), lying inside $B(p, 2)$; so $Q_p$ is compact by
[[cor-heine-borel-in-the-product-topology]]. It contains the open ball $B(p,1)$,
which contains $p$, so it is a compact neighbourhood of $p$. The space
$\mathbb{R}^n$ is not compact, so local compactness is strictly weaker than
compactness.
