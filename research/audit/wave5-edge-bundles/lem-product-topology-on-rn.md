`items/lem-product-topology-on-rn.md` — lemma — For $n \\ge 1$ the product topology on $n$ copies of the usual topology of $\\mathbb{R}$ is the metric topology of $d_\\infty$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, and hence also of $d_1$ and $d_2$, so $\\mathbb{R}^n$ as a product and $\\mathbb{R}^n$ as a metric space are one space

#### Statement

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, and give $\mathbb{R}$ its usual topology,
the metric topology of $d_{\mathbb{R}}(s,t) = |s-t|$
([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]], [[def-metrizable-space]]). Let

$$\mathbb{R}^n \;=\; \prod_{k < n} \mathbb{R}$$

be the product of $n$ copies of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-product-topology]]). As a
**set** this is literally the $\mathbb{R}^n$ of [[lem-metrics-on-rn]], both being
the set of functions $n \to \mathbb{R}$; and $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_\infty$ are the
three metrics defined there. Then:

1. The product topology on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the metric topology of $d_\infty$
   ([[def-metric-topology]]). The key computation is that a $d_\infty$-ball is a
   box:
   $$B_{d_\infty}(x, r) \;=\; \prod_{k<n} (x_k - r,\ x_k + r) \qquad (r > 0),$$
   a product of bounded open intervals ([[def-interval]]).
2. $d_\infty \le d_1 \le n\, d_\infty$ and $d_\infty \le d_2 \le n\, d_\infty$
   pointwise, so $d_1$ and $d_2$ are each Lipschitz equivalent to $d_\infty$
   ([[def-equivalent-metrics]]); here $n$ denotes the canonical natural
   $n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$.
3. Consequently all three metrics induce the product topology
   ([[thm-metric-equivalence-hierarchy]]). So $\mathbb{R}^n$ carrying the product
   topology and $\mathbb{R}^n$ carrying the topology of any one of $d_1$, $d_2$,
   $d_\infty$ are **one topological space**, and it is metrizable
   ([[def-metrizable-space]]).

**Why $n \ge 1$.** The metric $d_\infty$ is a maximum over $n$ terms, which does
not exist for $n = 0$; [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] carries the same hypothesis, and it
is carried here for the same reason. For $n = 0$ the product is a one-point space
and there is nothing to compare.

- [L1] The product topology on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} = \prod_{k<2}\mathbb{R}$ is the metric topology of $d_\infty\big((x,z),(x',z')\big) = \max\{|x-x'|, |z-z'|\}$ ([[lem-product-topology-on-rn]], [[lem-metrics-on-rn]], [[def-product-topology]], [[def-metric-topology]], [[def-metrizable-space]], [[def-max-min]], [[lem-finite-set-has-max]]).

### `rem-euclidean-topology-dictionary` (published-backward, page the-topology-of-euclidean-space)

Title: The product, Euclidean-metric and norm topologies on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ agree, and for $n=1$ they agree with the real-line topology

- For $n \ge 1$, the product topology on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the metric topology of each of $d_1$, $d_2$, and $d_\infty$ ([[lem-product-topology-on-rn]]). Every norm on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is equivalent to the Euclidean norm, hence induces that same topology ([[thm-all-norms-on-rn-are-equivalent]]). Thus open, closed, compact, connected, and continuous below have one unambiguous Euclidean meaning.
