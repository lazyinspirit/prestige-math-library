#### Statement

In any ordered field $F$ with positive cone $P$, the multiplicative identity
satisfies $0 < 1$; that is, $1 \in P$.

### `cex-strictly-decreasing-gaps-no-limit` (published-backward, page monotone-sequences-and-cauchy-completeness-examples)

Title: $x_{k+1} = x_k + 1/x_k$ from $x_1 = 1$ has strictly decreasing consecutive gaps and diverges, so no uniform $c < 1$ exists

- [L2] Order and arithmetic: $1 > 0$, so $2 = 1 + 1 > 0$; sums of positives are positive; adding a constant preserves the order; a positive has a positive inverse, and $0 < a < b$ gives $0 < 1/b < 1/a$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

### `ex-babylonian-sqrt-two` (published-backward, page monotone-sequences-and-cauchy-completeness-examples)

Title: The Babylonian sequence $x_1 = 2$, $x_{k+1} = (x_k + 2/x_k)/2$ decreases to $\\sqrt{2}$

- [L5] Order and arithmetic: $1 > 0$, hence $2 = 1 + 1 > 0$ and $2 > 1$; sums of positives are positive; adding a constant preserves the order; a positive has a positive inverse, and a quotient of positives is positive ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

### `ex-contractive-sequence-fixed-point` (published-backward, page monotone-sequences-and-cauchy-completeness-examples)

Title: The sequence $x_{k+1} = (x_k + 1)/3$ is contractive with $c = 1/3$ and converges to $1/2$

- [L2] Order and arithmetic: $1 > 0$, so $3 = 1+1+1 > 1 > 0$; a positive has a positive inverse; and $0 < r < 1$ exactly when $1/r > 1$, so $0 < 1/3 < 1$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[prop-of-reciprocal-order]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

### `ex-recursive-sqrt-two-plus-x` (published-backward, page monotone-sequences-and-cauchy-completeness-examples)

Title: The sequence $x_1 = 1$, $x_{k+1} = \\sqrt{2 + x_k}$ increases to $2$

- [L4] Order and arithmetic: $1 > 0$, so $2 = 1 + 1 > 0$ and $4 = 2 \cdot 2$; adding a constant preserves the order, and inequalities may be added ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

### `lem-alternating-sequence` (published-backward, page monotone-sequences-and-cauchy-completeness)

Title: The even and odd index maps and the alternating sequence: strictly increasing $e, o$ with $\\mathbb{N}$ their disjoint union, and the unique $(s_k)$ with $s_0 = 1$, $s_{\\sigma(k)} = -s_k$, which satisfies $|s_k| = 1$, $s \\circ e \\equiv 1$ and $s \\circ o \\equiv -1$

- [L6] Order in $\mathbb{R}$: $0 < 1$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]), sums of positives are positive and adding a constant preserves the order ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]), so $1 - (-1) = 1 + 1 > 0$ and hence $-1 < 1$; in particular $1 \ne -1$.

### `lem-geometric-sequence-null` (published-backward, page monotone-sequences-and-cauchy-completeness)

Title: For $|r| < 1$ the sequence $r^k$ is null, and for $|r| > 1$ the sequence $|r|^k$ diverges to $+\\infty$

- [L1] Absolute value: $|x| \ge 0$; $|x| = 0$ exactly when $x = 0$; $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; and $|x| = x$ when $x \ge 0$, so in particular $|1| = 1$ because $1 > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]], [[cor-of-one-positive]]).
