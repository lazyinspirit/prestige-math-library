#### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]), let
$A \subseteq X$ and let $x \in X$. Neighbourhoods are as in
[[def-neighbourhood-top]], so a neighbourhood need not be open.

- The **interior** of $A$ is
  $\operatorname{int}(A) := \bigcup \{\, U \in \mathcal{T} : U \subseteq A \,\}$.
- The **closure** of $A$ is
  $\overline{A} := \bigcap \{\, F \subseteq X : F \text{ closed and } A \subseteq F \,\}$.
- The **exterior** of $A$ is $\operatorname{ext}(A) := \operatorname{int}(X \setminus A)$.
- The **boundary** of $A$ is $\partial A := \overline{A} \setminus \operatorname{int}(A)$.
- $x$ is a **limit point** (accumulation point) of $A$ if every neighbourhood $N$
  of $x$ satisfies $N \cap (A \setminus \{x\}) \ne \varnothing$. The set of limit
  points of $A$ is the **derived set** $A'$.
- $x$ is an **isolated point of $A$** if $x \in A$ and some neighbourhood $N$ of
  $x$ satisfies $N \cap A = \{x\}$.

**Both operators are well posed, and the two names are justified rather than
asserted.** The interior is a union of open sets, hence open by (T2), it is
contained in $A$, and it contains every open $U \subseteq A$: so
$\operatorname{int}(A)$ is *the largest open subset of $A$*. The family being
intersected in the definition of $\overline{A}$ is nonempty, since $X$ is closed
and contains $A$, so the intersection is a set; it is closed by (C2) of
[[def-topological-space]], it contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed
$F \supseteq A$: so $\overline{A}$ is *the smallest closed superset of $A$*. In
particular

$$\operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq A \subseteq \overline{A},$$

and $A$ is open if and only if $A = \operatorname{int}(A)$, and closed if and
only if $A = \overline{A}$, in each case because one inclusion is automatic and
the other says exactly that $A$ belongs to the family in question.

**Interior and closure are exchanged by complementation.** For every
$A \subseteq X$,

$$X \setminus \operatorname{int}(A) = \overline{X \setminus A}, \qquad X \setminus \overline{A} = \operatorname{int}(X \setminus A) = \operatorname{ext}(A).$$

Indeed $U \mapsto X \setminus U$ is a bijection between the open subsets of $A$
and the closed supersets of $X \setminus A$, and it turns unions into
intersections ([[def-topological-space]]); applying complementation to the first
identity gives the second. So $\operatorname{ext}(A) = X \setminus \overline{A}$,
and every statement about interiors has a mirror statement about closures.

**The pointwise description of the interior.** $x \in \operatorname{int}(A)$ if
and only if $A$ is a neighbourhood of $x$. If $x \in \operatorname{int}(A)$ then
$\operatorname{int}(A)$ is an open set with $x \in \operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq A$;
conversely a neighbourhood relation $x \in U \subseteq A$ with $U$ open puts $x$
in the union defining $\operatorname{int}(A)$. The corresponding description of
the closure is proved as the next item, because it is the statement that does the
work in every later proof.

**$X$ is the disjoint union of the three regions.** Since
$\operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq \overline{A}$, the three sets
$\operatorname{int}(A)$, $\partial A = \overline{A} \setminus \operatorname{int}(A)$
and $\operatorname{ext}(A) = X \setminus \overline{A}$ are pairwise disjoint and
their union is $X$. This is recorded again, with the identities for interior and
closure of unions and intersections, in the lemma two items below.
