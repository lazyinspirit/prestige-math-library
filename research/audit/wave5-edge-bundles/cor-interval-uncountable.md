`items/cor-interval-uncountable.md` — corollary — Every nondegenerate interval of $\\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable

#### Statement

Let $\mathbb{R}$ be a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and
let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$. Then both

1. the closed interval $[a,b] = \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : a \le x \le b \,\}$, and
2. the open interval $(a,b) = \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : a < x < b \,\}$

are uncountable ([[def-countable]]).

**What this adds to [[thm-r-uncountable]], and what it does not inherit from it.**
That theorem states exactly one thing: $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable. Its statement
says nothing about any interval, so the present result cannot be read off it. Its
*proof*, on the other hand, is general in every part but its seed: the trisection
rule of its step 2.1 is constructed there for an arbitrary $(a,b) \in I$, and its
steps 4.1, 5.1 and 6.1, together with the interval reasoning of its step 7.1, use
nothing about the starting interval beyond the nesting and the strictness
$a_n < b_n$ that the rule delivers. Only three places are special to $\mathbb{R}$
and to $(0,1)$: the surjection of its step 1.1 is onto $\mathbb{R}$, the recursion
of its step 3.1 is seeded at $(0,(0,1))$, and the conclusion drawn in its step 7.1
is about $\mathbb{R}$. So the construction is re-run below, seeded
instead at the **middle third** of $(a,b)$, against a surjection onto $(a,b)$; the
remarks record why that seed and not $(a,b)$ itself.

- [L5] Every nondegenerate open interval of $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable, $\mathbb{Q}$ is at most countable, and a subset of an at most countable set is at most countable ([[cor-interval-uncountable]], [[thm-rationals-countable]], [[lem-subset-of-countable]], [[def-countable]]).
