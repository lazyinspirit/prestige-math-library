`items/def-compact-space.md` — definition — Open cover, subcover, and compact topological space; a compact subset is a subspace that is compact in its own right

#### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]).

- An **open cover** of $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a family
  $\mathcal{U} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$ of open sets with $X = \bigcup \mathcal{U}$,
  where $\bigcup \mathcal{U} = \{\, x \in X : x \in U \text{ for some } U \in \mathcal{U} \,\}$.
- A **subcover** of $\mathcal{U}$ is a subfamily $\mathcal{V} \subseteq \mathcal{U}$
  that is itself an open cover.
- A family $\mathcal{V}$ of sets is **finite** when $\mathcal{V} = \varnothing$ or
  there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and sets $V_0, \dots, V_n$ with
  $\mathcal{V} = \{V_0, \dots, V_n\}$; repetitions in the list are allowed and
  harmless.
- $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is **compact** when every open cover of it has a finite
  subcover: for every open cover $\mathcal{U}$, either $X = \varnothing$ and the
  empty subfamily covers it, or there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
  $U_0, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{U}$ with
  $$X = U_0 \cup \dots \cup U_n .$$
- A subset $A \subseteq X$ is a **compact subset** of $X$ when the subspace
  $(A, \mathcal{T}_A)$ is a compact topological space, $\mathcal{T}_A$ being the
  subspace topology ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]).

**Compactness of a subset is defined intrinsically, and only intrinsically.**
The last clause speaks about the subspace $(A, \mathcal{T}_A)$ and its own open
sets, not about families of open subsets of the ambient $X$. The two readings do
agree, but that is a theorem and not a convention: it is
[[lem-compactness-of-a-subspace-is-ambient]], and no item of this library may use
the ambient reading without citing it. Taking the intrinsic reading makes
compactness a property of the topological space $(A, \mathcal{T}_A)$ alone.
Hence it is preserved when $A$ is embedded homeomorphically as a subspace, or
when another ambient space induces the same topology on $A$; it need not be
preserved if the induced topology changes. This is exactly the convention already fixed for
metric spaces by [[def-metric-compactness]], and the agreement of that
definition with this one is [[thm-compactness-agrees-with-metric-compactness]].

**The empty space is compact**, since the empty subfamily of any family covers
it; this is the reason the clause above is written with the two cases. Every
space listed as $\{x_0, \dots, x_n\}$ is compact too: given a cover, each $x_i$
lies in some member, and finitely many members named in this way already cover.
So every finite space is compact, whatever its topology, and in particular the
discrete topology on a finite set is compact while the discrete topology on an
infinite set is not ([[def-standard-topologies]]).

**The finiteness convention.** "Finite" above is the listing form. It agrees with
the definition of finiteness by equinumerosity with a natural number
([[def-countable]]), in both directions, and the agreement is the one already
discharged in [[def-metric-compactness]]: a nonempty set equinumerous with
$m \ge 1$ is listable, and a set listed as $\{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$ injects into
$\sigma(n)$ by sending $x$ to the least $i \le n$ with $a_i = x$. Neither
direction uses a choice principle; the second selects nothing, taking a least
index instead.

**Quasicompact is not used here.** Some authors, following Bourbaki, reserve
*compact* for a space that is both compact in the above sense and Hausdorff, and
call the open-cover condition alone *quasicompact*. This library follows the more
widely adopted convention: **compact** means the open-cover condition and nothing
more, and a Hausdorff hypothesis is always written out. The fork is recorded in
[[rem-compactness-conventions-and-choice-ledger]].
