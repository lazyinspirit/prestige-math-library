#### Definition

A set $\alpha$ is an **ordinal** when both of the following hold.

1. $\alpha$ is a **transitive set**: every element of $\alpha$ is also a subset
   of $\alpha$, that is $x \in \alpha \Rightarrow x \subseteq \alpha$.
2. The membership relation restricted to $\alpha$, namely
   $\{(x, y) \in \alpha \times \alpha : x \in y\}$, is a **strict well-order**
   of $\alpha$ ([[def-well-order]]): it is irreflexive, transitive as a
   relation, trichotomous on $\alpha$, and every nonempty subset of $\alpha$ has
   an $\in$-least element.

Ordinals are written with lowercase Greek letters, and for ordinals we set

$$\alpha < \beta :\iff \alpha \in \beta, \qquad \alpha \le \beta :\iff (\alpha \in \beta \text{ or } \alpha = \beta).$$

Write $0 := \emptyset$, which is an ordinal because both clauses hold vacuously,
and write $\alpha^{+} := \alpha \cup \{\alpha\}$ for the **successor** of
$\alpha$.

### `cex-the-deleted-tychonoff-plank-is-not-normal` (published-backward, page separation-axioms-examples)

Title: Refuted, assuming countable choice: every Hausdorff space built from ordinal spaces is normal. The deleted Tychonoff plank $((\\omega_1 + 1) \\times (\\omega + 1)) \\setminus \\{(\\omega_1, \\omega)\\}$ is Hausdorff and not normal

- [L2] For ordinals exactly one of $\xi < \eta$, $\xi = \eta$, $\eta < \xi$ holds, and every nonempty set of ordinals has a least element ([[lem-ordinal-trichotomy]], [[lem-ordinal-basics]], [[def-ordinal]]).

### `def-order-topology-on-an-ordinal` (published-backward, page separation-axioms)

Title: The order topology on an ordinal, with the half-open intervals $(\\alpha, \\beta]$ and the initial segments $[0, \\beta]$ as a basis

- Let $\gamma$ be an ordinal ([[def-ordinal]]). Since $\gamma$ is the set of
- transitive and $\beta \in \gamma$ ([[def-ordinal]], [[lem-ordinal-basics]]).

### `ex-the-ordinal-spaces-omega-plus-one-and-omega-one` (published-backward, page separation-axioms-examples)

Title: $\\omega + 1$ as a convergent sequence together with its limit, and, assuming countable choice, $[0, \\omega_1)$, in which every sequence lies inside an at most countable initial segment

- ([[def-ordinal]]). **Assuming the Axiom of Countable Choice**
- [L6] For ordinals exactly one of $\xi < \eta$, $\xi = \eta$, $\eta < \xi$ holds; $\alpha^{+}$ is an ordinal, and $\alpha^{+} = \{\, \xi : \xi \le \alpha \,\}$ ([[lem-ordinal-trichotomy]], [[lem-ordinal-basics]], [[def-ordinal]]).

### `lem-ordinal-order-topology-is-t3` (published-backward, page separation-axioms)

Title: Every ordinal with its order topology has a basis of clopen sets, and is $T_1$, Hausdorff and regular

- Let $\gamma$ be an ordinal ([[def-ordinal]]) with its order topology
- [L1] For ordinals exactly one of $\zeta < \eta$, $\zeta = \eta$, $\eta < \zeta$ holds, and $<$ is transitive; every element of an ordinal is an ordinal ([[lem-ordinal-trichotomy]], [[lem-ordinal-basics]], [[def-ordinal]]).
