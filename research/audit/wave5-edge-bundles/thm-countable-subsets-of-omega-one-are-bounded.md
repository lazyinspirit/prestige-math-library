`items/thm-countable-subsets-of-omega-one-are-bounded.md` — theorem — Assuming countable choice: every at most countable subset of $\\omega_1$ is bounded below $\\omega_1$, so no at most countable subset of $\\omega_1$ is cofinal in it, and a supremum of at most countably many at most countable ordinals is at most countable

#### Statement

**Assume the Axiom of Countable Choice $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$**
([[def-countable-choice]]). Let $\omega_1$ be the first uncountable ordinal
([[def-first-uncountable-ordinal]]). Then:

**(a) Boundedness.** Every at most countable ([[def-countable]]) subset
$A \subseteq \omega_1$ is bounded below $\omega_1$: the ordinal
$\sup A = \bigcup A$ lies in $\omega_1$ and satisfies $\alpha \le \sup A$ for
every $\alpha \in A$.

**(b) No small cofinal set.** No at most countable subset of $\omega_1$ is
cofinal in $\omega_1$ ([[def-cofinal-subset-of-an-ordinal]]).

**(c) Suprema stay countable.** If $A$ is an at most countable set of at most
countable ordinals, then $\sup A = \bigcup A$ is an at most countable ordinal.

**The hypothesis is not decoration.** $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$ is spent at exactly
one step, step 1.2 below, and it is spent there only through
[[thm-countable-union-of-countable]], whose own statement carries the same
hypothesis. Everything else on this page, including the existence of $\omega_1$
and all of [[thm-omega-one-is-the-least-uncountable-ordinal]], is a theorem of
ZF. The ledger is the choice-ledger remark at the end of this page.

Title: Refuted, assuming countable choice: every Hausdorff space built from ordinal spaces is normal. The deleted Tychonoff plank $((\\omega_1 + 1) \\times (\\omega + 1)) \\setminus \\{(\\omega_1, \\omega)\\}$ is Hausdorff and not normal

- is inherited from [[thm-countable-subsets-of-omega-one-are-bounded]], which is
- [L3] Assuming $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$, every at most countable subset of $\omega_1$ has an upper bound $\alpha \in \omega_1$, and no such subset is cofinal in $\omega_1$ ([[thm-countable-subsets-of-omega-one-are-bounded]], [[def-cofinal-subset-of-an-ordinal]], [[def-countable-choice]]).
- - **The ordinals $\alpha_n$ are defined, not chosen.** Taking the *least* $\alpha$ that works is what keeps the construction free of dependent choice; the only choice principle in the argument is the countable one inside [[thm-countable-subsets-of-omega-one-are-bounded]], and it is declared in the statement.

- **NO WIKILINK TO THE TARGET ANYWHERE IN THE BODY** — the dependency is declared in `deps` but never cited in a fact or step. Report whether that is a stale declaration or a use that lost its citation.

Title: $\\omega + 1$ as a convergent sequence together with its limit, and, assuming countable choice, $[0, \\omega_1)$, in which every sequence lies inside an at most countable initial segment

- [L4] Assuming $\mathrm{AC}_\omega$, every at most countable subset of $\omega_1$ is bounded below $\omega_1$: there is $\alpha \in \omega_1$ with $\xi \le \alpha$ for every $\xi$ in the subset ([[thm-countable-subsets-of-omega-one-are-bounded]], [[def-countable-choice]]).
- - **Clause 3 is where the countable choice enters and where it stays.** It is inherited from [[thm-countable-subsets-of-omega-one-are-bounded]] and from nothing else on this page; clauses 1, 2 and the $T_3$ property of both spaces are theorems of ZF ([[lem-ordinal-order-topology-is-t3]]).
