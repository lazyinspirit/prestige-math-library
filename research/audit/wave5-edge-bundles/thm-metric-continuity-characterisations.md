`items/thm-metric-continuity-characterisations.md` — theorem — For a map of metric spaces the following agree: $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuity everywhere, preimages of open sets are open, preimages of closed sets are closed, sequential continuity, and $f(\\overline{A}) \\subseteq \\overline{f(A)}$

#### Statement

Let $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ be metric spaces ([[def-metric-space]]) and let
$f : X \to Y$ be a function, with images and preimages written $f[\,\cdot\,]$
and $f^{-1}[\,\cdot\,]$ ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]). The following
five statements are equivalent.

- **(a)** $f$ is continuous at every point of $X$ in the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$
  sense ([[def-metric-continuity]]).
- **(b)** $f^{-1}[V]$ is open in $X$ for every open $V \subseteq Y$
  ([[def-metric-topology]]).
- **(c)** $f^{-1}[G]$ is closed in $X$ for every closed $G \subseteq Y$.
- **(d)** $f$ is **sequentially continuous**: whenever $x_k \to x$ in $(X,d_X)$,
  also $f(x_k) \to f(x)$ in $(Y,d_Y)$ ([[def-metric-convergence]]).
- **(e)** $f[\overline{A}] \subseteq \overline{f[A]}$ for every $A \subseteq X$
  ([[def-metric-interior-closure-boundary]]).

**Where choice is used.** Only the implication (d) $\Rightarrow$ (e) uses a
choice principle, and it uses it only through
[[thm-metric-sequential-closure]], whose forward direction spends the Axiom of
Countable Choice ([[def-countable-choice]]). The cycle
(a) $\Rightarrow$ (b) $\Rightarrow$ (c) $\Rightarrow$ (e) $\Rightarrow$ (a) and
the implication (a) $\Rightarrow$ (d) are choice free.

Title: In a metric space every closed set is a zero set and a $G_\\delta$, and the distance function separates a point from a closed set, so every metrizable space is Tychonoff and perfectly normal

- [L3] A map between metric spaces satisfying an inequality $|g(x) - g(y)| \le L\, d(x,y)$ with $L > 0$ is continuous in the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ sense, by $\delta := \varepsilon / L$, and is therefore continuous as a map of topological spaces ([[def-metric-continuity]], [[thm-metric-continuity-characterisations]], clause (b), [[def-metrizable-space]]).
