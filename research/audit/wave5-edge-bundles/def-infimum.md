`items/def-infimum.md` — definition — Greatest lower bound (infimum)

#### Definition

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $\ell \in \mathbb{R}$. Then $\ell$ is a
**greatest lower bound**, or **infimum**, of $S$ if both of the following hold:

- $\ell$ is a lower bound of $S$ ([[def-bounded-set]]), that is, $\ell \le s$ for
  every $s \in S$;
- $\ell' \le \ell$ for every lower bound $\ell'$ of $S$.

Written out in one line:

$$\ell \text{ is an infimum of } S \iff \big[(\forall s \in S)\, \ell \le s\big] \text{ and } \big[(\forall \ell' \in \mathbb{R})\, \big((\forall s \in S)\, \ell' \le s\big) \Rightarrow \ell' \le \ell\big].$$

An infimum, when it exists, is unique ([[lem-sup-unique]]), so we may write
$\inf S$ for it.

Title: Every nonempty closed subset $A$ of $\\mathbb{R}$ is the zero set of $x \\mapsto d(x, A)$ and the intersection of the open sets $\\{x : d(x,A) < 1/(n+1)\\}$, worked for $[0,1]$ and for $\\{0\\}$

- [A1] $d(x,A) = \inf\{\, |x-a| : a \in A \,\}$ exists for nonempty $A$, is a lower bound of that set, and is $\le |x-a|$ for every $a \in A$; and any real that is a lower bound of the set is $\le d(x,A)$ ([[def-metric-bounded-diameter]], [[def-infimum]]).

- [L4] For nonempty $A$ the closure is $\overline{A} = \{\, x : d(x,A) = 0 \,\}$, a closed set equals its closure and contains it, and $d(x,A) \ge 0$ with $d(x,A) \le d(x,a)$ for every $a \in A$; $d(x,A) = 0$ when $x \in A$ ([[thm-metric-closure-characterisation]], [[def-metric-bounded-diameter]], [[def-infimum]]).

- [L5] For nonempty $A \subseteq Y$ the distance $y \mapsto d(y,A)$ is defined, is $1$-Lipschitz and hence continuous, and satisfies $d(y,A) \le d(y,z)$ for every $z \in A$ ([[def-metric-bounded-diameter]], [[lem-distance-to-set-is-lipschitz]], [[thm-metric-regularity-hierarchy]], [[def-lipschitz-holder-contraction]], [[def-infimum]]).

Title: In a metric space any two separated sets have disjoint open neighbourhoods, so every metrizable space is completely normal

- [L1] For nonempty $S \subseteq X$ and $x \in X$ the distance $d(x,S) = \inf\{\, d(x,s) : s \in S \,\}$ exists in $\mathbb{R}$, is a lower bound of that set, and satisfies $d(x,S) \ge 0$ ([[def-metric-bounded-diameter]], [[def-infimum]], [[thm-infimum-property]], [[lem-metric-nonnegativity]]).
