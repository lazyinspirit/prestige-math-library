#### Statement

Let $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ be sequences of reals ([[def-sequence]]) converging to
$x$ and $y$ respectively ([[def-real-limit]]). If $x_k \le y_k$ eventually, that
is for all $k$ from some index on, then

$$\lim_{k} x_k \;\le\; \lim_{k} y_k .$$

In particular, if $x_k \ge 0$ eventually then $\lim_k x_k \ge 0$, and if
$a \le x_k \le b$ eventually then $a \le \lim_k x_k \le b$.

The conclusion is **not** strict, and cannot be made strict; see the remarks
below and the false statement at the end of this page.
