#### Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]), with open sets as in
[[def-metric-topology]] and balls as in [[def-metric-ball]].

- An **open cover** of $(X,d)$ is a family $\mathcal{U}$ of open subsets of $X$
  with $X = \bigcup \mathcal{U}$, where
  $\bigcup \mathcal{U} = \{\, x \in X : x \in U \text{ for some } U \in \mathcal{U} \,\}$.
- A **subcover** of $\mathcal{U}$ is a subfamily
  $\mathcal{V} \subseteq \mathcal{U}$ that is itself an open cover.
- A family $\mathcal{V}$ of sets is **finite** when $\mathcal{V} = \emptyset$ or
  there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and sets $V_0, \dots, V_n$ with
  $\mathcal{V} = \{V_0, \dots, V_n\}$; repetitions in the list are allowed and
  harmless.
- $(X,d)$ is **compact** when every open cover of it has a finite subcover: for
  every open cover $\mathcal{U}$, either $X = \emptyset$ and the empty subfamily
  covers it, or there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
  $U_0, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{U}$ with
  $$X = U_0 \cup \dots \cup U_n .$$
- A subset $A \subseteq X$ is a **compact subset** of $X$ when the metric
  subspace $(A, d_A)$ is a compact metric space, $d_A$ being the restriction of
  $d$ to $A \times A$ ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]).

**Compactness of a subset is defined intrinsically, and only intrinsically.**
The last clause speaks about the subspace $(A,d_A)$ and its own open sets, not
about families of open subsets of the ambient $X$. The two readings do agree,
but that is a theorem and not a convention: it is
[[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]], and no item of this library may use the
ambient reading without citing it. Taking the intrinsic reading as the
definition is what makes "compact" a property of the metric space $(A,d_A)$
alone, so that a set compact in one ambient space is compact in every other one
containing it isometrically.

**The empty space is compact**, since the empty subfamily of any family covers
it; this is the reason the clause above is written with the two cases. The
one-point space is compact too, and so is every space listed as
$\{x_0, \dots, x_n\}$: given a cover, each $x_i$ lies in some member, and
finitely many members chosen in this way already cover.

**The finiteness convention, and how it is used both ways.** "Finite" above is
the listing form, matching the finite lists of
[[def-finite-intersection-property]]. It agrees with the definition of
finiteness by equinumerosity with a natural number ([[def-countable]]), and
both directions of the agreement are available and are used below:

- A nonempty finite set $F$ in the sense of [[def-countable]] satisfies
  $F \approx m$ for some $m \ge 1$, and a bijection $m \to F$ is exactly a
  listing $F = \{a_0, \dots, a_{m-1}\}$.
- Conversely a set listed as $A = \{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$, that is the image of a
  function $a$ with domain $\sigma(n)$, is finite in the sense of
  [[def-countable]]: the map sending $x \in A$ to the least $i \le n$ with
  $a_i = x$ is an injection of $A$ into $\sigma(n)$, so $A$ is equinumerous with
  a subset of $\mathbb{N}$ bounded above, and such a subset is finite
  ([[lem-subset-of-countable]]).

Neither direction uses a choice principle: the second selects nothing, taking a
least index instead.
