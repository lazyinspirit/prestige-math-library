#### Definition

Let $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ be metric spaces ([[def-metric-space]]) and let
$f : X \to Y$ be a function.

$f$ is **uniformly continuous** if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a
real $\delta > 0$ such that

$$d_X(x,x') < \delta \;\Longrightarrow\; d_Y\big(f(x), f(x')\big) < \varepsilon \qquad \text{for all } x, x' \in X .$$

**The whole content is in the quantifier order.** Continuity at a point $a$
allows $\delta$ to depend on $\varepsilon$ *and on $a$*
([[def-metric-continuity]]); uniform continuity demands one $\delta$ that works
for every pair of points at once. Written with the quantifiers in order,
continuity on $X$ is
$\forall \varepsilon\, \forall a\, \exists \delta\, \forall x$ and uniform
continuity is $\forall \varepsilon\, \exists \delta\, \forall a\, \forall x$;
moving $\exists \delta$ to the left is the entire difference, and it is a
strictly stronger condition.

**Uniform continuity is a property of the triple $(d_X, d_Y, f)$.** Both metrics
are named, and neither may be replaced by a merely topologically equivalent one
without changing the notion.

**This definition was promised earlier and is now discharged.**
[[def-metric-continuity]] records that uniform continuity is not defined there,
and [[def-equivalent-metrics]] writes the condition out in full for the identity
maps of two metrics on one set rather than naming it. With the definition above,
*uniform equivalence* of $d$ and $d'$ says exactly that
$\mathrm{id} : (X,d) \to (X,d')$ and $\mathrm{id} : (X,d') \to (X,d)$ are both
uniformly continuous, which is how that condition is read from here on.
