You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as a
read-only adversarial proof-refuter for the published-page audit. You are
tool-less: you cannot open a file, run a command, browse, edit, or delegate.
Everything you may rely on is reproduced in the `This dispatch` section. Return
evidence only; Audit-Alpha alone adjudicates and edits.

## Triage — the standing rule (verbatim, binding on you)

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct
  citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

## Adversarial standard

Read the target's title, Statement/Definition/Example/Statement refuted, Facts &
Assumptions, every numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks.
Try to falsify the public claim and every load-bearing inference.

1. Compare every cited fact with the supplied source text before alleging that
   it is weak. Check domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, direction, conclusion,
   and whether the source licenses the exact use.
2. Check that the title and public statement assert no more than the proof
   establishes, and that every proof step uses only available premises.
3. Check both directions of biconditionals, uniqueness/existence claims,
   induction and limiting arguments, empty/zero/endpoint/degenerate cases,
   extended-real conventions, index shifts, and hidden division or choice.
4. Re-read Remarks as skeptically as a numbered step. A false mathematical
   remark is a defect even when the proof is sound.
5. When the target is marked `ai-generated`, actively search for a
   counterexample to its claim, witness, or refutation rather than merely
   checking prose consistency.
6. Treat a false public claim, logically invalid proof, missing necessary
   hypothesis, circularity, or materially inaccurate load-bearing citation as
   fatal. Do not inflate an expository omission or a gap closable within thirty
   seconds into a defect.

## Output format

Reply with exactly this structure and no preamble:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

If `DEFECTS`, give one block per finding:

```text
FINDING 1
  location: [exact title, section, fact label, or numbered step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [the exact mathematical assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, missing hypothesis, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]
```

Then always end with:

```text
BOUNDARY: [specific boundary/counterexample checks and their disposition]
SOURCES:  [confirm every supplied cited item used by the target was inspected]
CHECKED:  [confirm the title, public claim, every numbered step, and Remarks were read]

## Example

Take $b = 10$, so $\beta = \iota(10)$, and read a digit sequence $(d_j)$ as the
series $\sum_{j \ge 0}\iota(d_j)/\beta^{\,j+1}$ ([[thm-decimal-expansions]]).

**All nines.** The constant sequence $d_j = 9$ gives, by the geometric series,

$$\sum_{j\ge0}\frac{9}{10^{\,j+1}} \;=\; \frac{9}{10}\cdot\frac{1}{1 - 1/10} \;=\; 1 ,$$

which is the statement usually written $0.999\dots = 1$. Since $1 \notin [0,1)$
([[def-interval]]), this digit sequence is not the expansion of any point of
$[0,1)$ produced by [[thm-decimal-expansions]], and no uniqueness clause is
violated.

**Two expansions of one number.** For $x = 1/2$ the construction of
[[thm-decimal-expansions]] returns $d_0 = 5$ and $d_j = 0$ for $j \ge 1$: the
residue $r_0 = 1/2$ lies in $[5/10, 6/10)$, and $r_1 = 10\cdot\tfrac12 - 5 = 0$,
after which every digit is $0$. But the sequence $d'_0 = 4$, $d'_j = 9$ for
$j \ge 1$ has

$$\frac{4}{10} + \sum_{j\ge1}\frac{9}{10^{\,j+1}} \;=\; \frac{4}{10} + \frac{9}{100}\cdot\frac{1}{1-1/10} \;=\; \frac{4}{10} + \frac{1}{10} \;=\; \frac12 ,$$

which is $0.4999\dots = 0.5$. So two **different** digit sequences have the same
sum, and uniqueness in [[thm-decimal-expansions]] survives only because $(d'_j)$
is terminal, being eventually constantly $b - 1 = 9$.

**This is the whole of the nonuniqueness.** The uniqueness proof shows that two
distinct digit sequences with the same sum must differ by one at the first index
where they differ and then be all $b-1$ against all $0$. So excluding the terminal
sequences excludes exactly one member of each such pair, and nothing else.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The base $b = 10$ with $\beta = \iota(10)$, the digit sequences $d_j = 9$ for all $j$; $e_0 = 5$ with $e_j = 0$ for $j \ge 1$; and $d'_0 = 4$ with $d'_j = 9$ for $j \ge 1$.

[L1] Geometric series: for $|x| < 1$, $\sum_k x^{k}$ converges with sum $1/(1-x)$, the first term being $x^{0} = 1$ ([[thm-geometric-series]], [[def-series]]).

[L2] Powers and canonical naturals: $\beta^{0} = 1$, $\beta^{n+1} = \beta^{n}\beta$, $(uv)^{n} = u^{n}v^{n}$; $\iota$ is additive and multiplicative on positive naturals and strictly increasing ([[def-integer-power]], [[lem-power-laws]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L3] Linearity of convergent series, and a series converges if and only if each tail series does, the sum splitting as the initial partial sum plus the tail sum ([[lem-series-linearity]], [[lem-series-tail-invariance]], [[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L4] Base-$b$ expansions: for $b \ge 2$ every $x \in [0,1)$ has exactly one non-terminal digit sequence summing to $x$, the digits being produced by the residue recursion with $d(r)$ the unique digit with $\iota(d)/\beta \le r < \iota(d+1)/\beta$ ([[thm-decimal-expansions]], [[def-interval]], [[def-real-limit]]).

## Verification

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Since $\beta = \iota(10) \ge 2 > 1$, one has $0 < 1/\beta < 1$, so $\sum_k (1/\beta)^{k}$ converges with sum $1/(1 - 1/\beta) = \beta/(\beta-1) = 10/9$. [L1, L2]

1.2 For $x = 1/2$ the residue recursion gives $d_0 = 5$, since $\iota(5)/\beta = 1/2 \le 1/2 < 6/10 = \iota(6)/\beta$, and then $r_1 = \beta\cdot\tfrac12 - \iota(5) = 5 - 5 = 0$, whence $d_j = 0$ and $r_{j+1} = 0$ for every $j \ge 1$. This sequence is non-terminal and sums to $5/10 = 1/2$. [L2, L4]

2.1 Hence $\sum_{j\ge0} 9/\beta^{\,j+1} = (9/\beta)\sum_{j\ge0}(1/\beta)^{\,j} = (9/10)(10/9) = 1$, using linearity and $\beta^{\,j+1} = \beta\,\beta^{\,j}$. [step 1.1, L2, L3]

3.1 So the all-nines digit sequence has sum $1$, and $1 \notin [0,1)$; by [L4] it is therefore not the expansion of any $x \in [0,1)$, and it is terminal. [step 2.1, L4]

3.2 The sequence $(d'_j)$ with $d'_0 = 4$ and $d'_j = 9$ for $j \ge 1$ has sum $4/10 + \sum_{j\ge1}9/\beta^{\,j+1}$, and by step 2.1 with the first term removed, $\sum_{j\ge1}9/\beta^{\,j+1} = (1/\beta)\sum_{j\ge0}9/\beta^{\,j+1} = 1/10$; so its sum is $4/10 + 1/10 = 1/2$. [step 2.1, L2, L3]

4.1 Thus $(e_j)$ and $(d'_j)$ are different digit sequences with the same sum $1/2$, so a real number in $[0,1)$ can have two base-$10$ expansions. [step 1.2, step 3.2]

5.1 No uniqueness claim is contradicted: $(d'_j)$ is terminal, being constantly $9 = b-1$ from index $1$ on, and [L4] asserts uniqueness only among non-terminal sequences, of which $(e_j)$ is the one belonging to $1/2$. [step 1.2, step 4.1, L4] ∎

## Remarks

- **"$0.999\dots = 1$" is an identity between a series and a number, and nothing stranger.** The left side denotes the sum of $\sum_{j\ge0}9/10^{\,j+1}$, which step 2.1 computes to be $1$ by the geometric series. There is no approximation and no limiting process beyond the one already in [[def-series]].

- **Which of the two expansions the construction returns.** The residue recursion of [[thm-decimal-expansions]] always takes the largest digit $d$ with $\iota(d)/\beta \le r$, so it produces the expansion ending in zeros rather than the one ending in nines. That is why the constructed sequence is automatically non-terminal, as the theorem records.

- **The same pair exists in every base.** For $b = 2$ the two expansions of $1/2$ are $0.1000\dots$ and $0.0111\dots$; the argument above is the case $b = 10$ of a computation that uses only $\sum_{j\ge0}(b-1)/b^{\,j+1} = 1$.

## Definition

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]) with additive identity $0_F$ and
multiplicative identity $1_F$. Define
$\iota : \mathbb{N} \to F$ by recursion on $\mathbb{N}$
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[thm-recursion]]):

$$\iota(0) \;:=\; 0_F, \qquad \iota(n+1) \;:=\; \iota(n) + 1_F .$$

$\iota(n)$ is the **canonical natural** of $n$ in $F$. It is also written
$n \cdot 1_F$, and for $n \ge 1$ it is $1_F$ added to itself $n$ times.

**Why the notation is needed at all.** A natural number in this library is a von
Neumann natural, that is a set ([[def-natural-numbers]]), and a set is not an
element of $F$. So $1/n$, $n^{\alpha}$ and $x/n$ are not expressions of $F$ when
$n$ is a natural: what they mean is $1/\iota(n)$, $\iota(n)^{\alpha}$ and
$x/\iota(n)$. The map $\iota$ is what carries a counting number into the field,
and writing it is the whole reason a reader meets $1/\iota(k+1)$ where an
informal text would write $1/(k+1)$.

## Remarks

- **Where the index shift comes from.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
  ([[def-natural-numbers]]) and $\iota(0) = 0_F$, so $1/\iota(k)$ is undefined at
  $k = 0$. A family of reciprocals indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ is therefore written
  over $\iota(k+1)$, which is why the harmonic and telescoping families of this
  library run over $k+1$ rather than over $k$. This is bookkeeping, not a
  restriction: the values are the usual ones.

- **This definition records notation; the arithmetic is proved elsewhere.** That
  $\iota$ is strictly increasing and positive on $n \ge 1$, and that it carries
  sums to sums and products to products, is [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], stated
  for an ordered field. That lemma introduces the same element by the equivalent
  recursion $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, which
  agrees with the definition above because $\iota(1) = \iota(0) + 1_F = 1_F$.
  Nothing here is new mathematics; the definition exists so that the notation has
  a home a reader can look up.

- **The symbol $\iota$ is used in this library for other canonical maps, and this
  definition does not govern them.** It also denotes the canonical field
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to F$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), the isometric
  embedding of a metric space into a completion ([[def-metric-completion]]), and
  an inclusion map $\iota : S \to X$ of a subspace. Each of those is introduced
  where it is used and means something different from the map defined here. What
  the four share is only that each is the canonical map of its situation.

- **Fields, not just ordered fields.** The recursion needs no order, so the
  definition is stated for a field; every use in this library is in an ordered
  field, and the order is what makes $\iota$ injective
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). In a field of positive characteristic $\iota$
  is not injective, which is one reason the injectivity is a lemma rather than
  part of the definition.

## Definition

Throughout this page $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]), in particular an ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]]) and a field ([[def-field]]), and $\mathbb{N}$ is the set
of natural numbers ([[def-natural-numbers]]) with successor $\sigma(n) = n + 1$
([[def-nat-addition]]).

Let $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a sequence of reals, written $a_k$ for
$a(k)$. **Finite sums and finite products of $a$ are defined by recursion on the
upper index**, which is legitimate because of the recursion theorem
([[thm-recursion]]). That theorem produces a function of one variable, so the
running index has to be carried along inside the value: applying it to the set
$A = \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$, the starting element $(0, 0)$ and the function
$f(n, s) = (\sigma(n),\, s + a_n)$ gives a unique
$g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$ with

$$g(0) = (0, 0), \qquad g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n)) \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Write $g(n) = \big(\pi_1(g(n)),\, \Sigma_n\big)$ for its two coordinates.

**The first coordinate is the index itself, and that is a small induction, not an
observation** ([[thm-induction-principle]]). Indeed $\pi_1(g(0)) = 0$; and if
$\pi_1(g(n)) = n$, then
$g(\sigma(n)) = f\big(\pi_1(g(n)), \Sigma_n\big) = \big(\sigma(\pi_1(g(n))),\, \Sigma_n + a_{\pi_1(g(n))}\big) = \big(\sigma(n),\, \Sigma_n + a_n\big)$,
so $\pi_1(g(\sigma(n))) = \sigma(n)$. By induction $\pi_1(g(n)) = n$ for every
$n \in \mathbb{N}$. Only now may the second coordinate of the two displayed
clauses be read off, and doing so gives

$$\Sigma_0 = 0, \qquad \Sigma_{\sigma(n)} = \Sigma_n + a_n .$$

$\Sigma$ is moreover the **unique** function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with those
two properties: if $\Sigma'$ also has them then $n \mapsto (n, \Sigma'_n)$ satisfies
the two clauses defining $g$, hence equals $g$ by the uniqueness clause of
[[thm-recursion]], so $\Sigma' = \Sigma$.

We write $\sum_{k < n} a_k := \Sigma_n$. The same construction with starting
element $(0, 1)$ and $f(n, p) = (\sigma(n),\, p \cdot a_n)$, with the same
induction on the first coordinate and the same uniqueness argument, gives the
unique $\Pi : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with

$$\Pi_0 = 1, \qquad \Pi_{\sigma(n)} = \Pi_n \cdot a_n ,$$

and we write $\prod_{k < n} a_k := \Pi_n$.

**Notation.** For $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ we abbreviate

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \sum_{k < n+1} a_k, \qquad \prod_{k=0}^{n} a_k := \prod_{k < n+1} a_k,$$

and, for a general lower index $m$ with $m \le n + 1$, writing $d = n + 1 - m$
for the number of terms,

$$\sum_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \sum_{j < d} a_{m+j}, \qquad \prod_{k=m}^{n} a_k := \prod_{j < d} a_{m+j} .$$

When $m = n + 1$ we have $d = 0$ and the sum is **empty**, with value $0$, while
the empty product has value $1$. In the same spirit $\sum_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ is
notation for the empty sum $\Sigma_0 = 0$ and $\prod_{k=0}^{-1} a_k$ for the
empty product $\Pi_0 = 1$; the index $-1$ never occurs as an element of
$\mathbb{N}$ and is only a way of writing "no terms".

Only finitely many values of $a$ enter $\sum_{k<n} a_k$, so the notation
$\sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\prod_{k<n} a_k$ is also used for a list
$a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$ of reals given without reference to any extension of the
list to all of $\mathbb{N}$: extend the list by $a_k = 0$ (respectively
$a_k = 1$) for $k \ge n$ and apply the definition above.

## Remarks

- **Why recursion and not "$a_0 + a_1 + \cdots + a_{n-1}$".** The dots are not a
  definition: they presuppose that the displayed pattern determines a value for
  every $n$, which is exactly what the recursion theorem
  ([[thm-recursion]]) supplies, and its uniqueness clause is what makes
  $\sum_{k<n} a_k$ a single well-determined real rather than a family of choices.
  Associativity and commutativity of addition are *not* used in the definition;
  they are used in the laws proved from it ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).
- **Naturals and rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$ (a convention used on the whole
  page).** A natural number $n$ and a rational number $r$ are not literally
  elements of $\mathbb{R}$: they enter $\mathbb{R}$ through the canonical
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$, which is an injective,
  order-preserving field homomorphism ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), restricting on
  positive naturals to $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}} = 1_\mathbb{R} + \cdots + 1_\mathbb{R}$
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). Following ordinary practice, and only where no
  confusion is possible, we write $n$ for $\iota(n)$ and $r$ for $\iota(r)$; so,
  for instance, $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k<n} a_k$ means
  $\iota(n)^{-1} \cdot \sum_{k<n} a_k$, which makes sense because
  $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$. Exponents are the one place where the
  identification is deliberately NOT made: in $a^n$ and $a^r$ the exponent stays
  a natural, an integer or a rational ([[def-integer-power]],
  [[def-rational-power]]), never a real.
- The two indexings are related by $\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k = \sum_{k < n+1} a_k$, so
  a statement proved for one is available for the other. Sums over $k < n$ are
  the primitive form here because $\Sigma_0$, the empty sum, is then the base
  case of every induction, and no index outside $\mathbb{N}$ is ever needed.

## Definition

Let $a \in \mathbb{R}$, where $\mathbb{R}$ is the ambient ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]).

**Natural exponents.** By the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) applied to
the set $\mathbb{R}$, the starting element $1$ and the function
$f(x) = x \cdot a$, there is a unique function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$,
written $n \mapsto a^n$, with

$$a^0 = 1, \qquad a^{n+1} = a^n \cdot a \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Thus $a^1 = a$, $a^2 = a \cdot a$, and so on. Note that this is defined for
**every** $a$, including $a = 0$.

**Negative exponents.** If $a \ne 0$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, set

$$a^{-n} := (a^n)^{-1}.$$

**Why that is legitimate.** The right-hand side presupposes that $a^n$ is
invertible, that is, that $a^n \ne 0$. This is a proof obligation and not an
observation, and it is discharged by claim 2 of [[lem-power-laws]]: for $a \ne 0$
in a field, $a^n \ne 0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, proved there by induction on
$n$ from the fact that a field has no zero divisors ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]).
That lemma is a statement *about* the operation introduced here, so it depends on
this definition and is recorded in this item's `justified_by` rather than in its
`deps` (SCHEMA §3). Given $a^n \ne 0$, the value $(a^n)^{-1}$ is a single
well-determined element, because multiplicative inverses in a field are unique
([[lem-of-inverse-unique]]).

**Integer exponents.** Every integer $m$ ([[def-integers]]) is either
$\iota(n)$ or $-\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$, where $\iota$ is the
embedding $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]],
[[def-int-operations]]). This too is a citation and not a slogan: the order on
$\mathbb{Z}$ is total ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), so $m \ge 0$ or $m < 0$; the
image of $\iota$ is exactly the set of nonnegative integers, and each of them is
$\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]); and if $m < 0$ then
$-m > 0$, by compatibility of the order with addition ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]),
so $-m = \iota(n)$ and $m = -\iota(n)$, with $n$ unique because $\iota$ is
injective. The two clauses above therefore define $a^m$ for every
$m \in \mathbb{Z}$ whenever $a \ne 0$, and for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$ for
arbitrary $a$. The clauses are consistent where they overlap: the only overlap is
$m = 0$, where $-\iota(0) = \iota(0)$ and $(a^0)^{-1} = 1^{-1} = 1 = a^0$.

## Remarks

- **The convention $0^0 = 1$ is adopted here**, and it is not a matter of taste
  but of agreement with the recursion above: $a^0 = 1$ is the starting value for
  every $a$, exactly as the empty product is $1$ ([[def-finite-sum]]). This is
  the convention that makes the empty product, the binomial theorem, and
  polynomial notation $\sum_k c_k x^k$ work at $x = 0$ without an exception. The
  competing convention "$0^0$ undefined" belongs to contexts where $x^y$ is
  studied as a function of two *real* variables and one wants continuity, which
  is unavailable and irrelevant here: the exponent in $a^m$ is an integer, never
  a real.
- $0^n = 0$ for every $n \ge 1$, since $0^{n} = 0^{n-1} \cdot 0 = 0$, a product
  with a zero factor ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]); and
  $0^{-n}$ is not defined for $n \ge 1$, since $0$ has no inverse.
- The exponent is an integer and stays an integer. Rational exponents are a
  separate construction resting on the existence of roots
  ([[thm-nth-roots-exist]], [[def-rational-power]]), and real exponents do not
  exist in this library yet ([[rem-real-exponents-deferred]]).
- The laws $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$ are
  proved, not assumed, in [[lem-power-laws]]; the order behaviour of $a \mapsto a^n$
  is [[lem-power-monotone]].

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-real-numbers]]) and
a **sequence of reals** is a function $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$
([[def-sequence]]), written $(a_k)$; recall that $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$.

**Partial sums.** Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals. Its **sequence of partial
sums** is

$$s_n \;:=\; \sum_{k < n} a_k \qquad (n \in \mathbb{N}),$$

the finite sum of [[def-finite-sum]]. In particular $s_0 = 0$, the empty sum, and
$s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ for every $n$, those being exactly the two recursion clauses
that define the finite sum. Note that $s_n$ is the sum of the $n$ terms
$a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$, so the index $n$ counts terms rather than naming the last
one.

**Convergence, the sum, divergence.** The **series** of $(a_k)$, written
$\sum a_k$, **converges** when the sequence $(s_n)$ of partial sums converges
([[def-real-limit]]), and then the **sum of the series** is

$$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k \;:=\; \lim_{n} s_n .$$

The series **diverges** when $(s_n)$ does not converge. A convergent sequence of
reals has exactly one limit ([[lem-limit-unique]]), so the displayed symbol names
a single real number and nothing further has to be checked for it to be
well defined.

**Series with a general starting index.** Let $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $a$ be a
function on $\{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : k \ge m \,\}$, which we call a **family from
$m$** and write $(a_k)_{k \ge m}$. The series

$$\sum_{k \ge m} a_k$$

is by definition the series of the sequence $b_j := a_{j + m}$,
$j \in \mathbb{N}$, which is a genuine sequence of reals; it converges exactly
when that series converges, and its sum is then written
$\sum_{k = m}^{\infty} a_k$. Its partial sums are

$$\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k \;=\; \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j} \qquad (n \ge m),$$

in the notation of [[def-finite-sum]], the value at $n = m$ being the empty sum
$0$. A sequence on $\mathbb{N}$ is the case $m = 0$, and the two readings of
$\sum a_k$ agree there, since $b_j = a_j$.

**This clause is not a convenience.** Sequences in this library are functions on
$\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$ ([[def-sequence]]), while many of the
classical series are built from expressions that are undefined at the index $0$:
$1/k$, $1/k^{p}$ and $|a_k|^{1/k}$ all require $k \ge 1$. Writing such a series as
$\sum_{k \ge 1} a_k$ names an honest object, whereas writing it as a sequence on
$\mathbb{N}$ would require a value at an index where the defining expression has
none. Every statement on this page says which starting index it uses.

**Tail series.** For $N \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$N$-th tail series** of
$\sum a_k$ is $\sum_{k \ge N} a_k$, that is the series of the $N$-th tail
$a^{(N)}$ of [[def-sequence]], whose terms are $a^{(N)}_j = a_{j+N}$. The
$0$-th tail series is the series itself.

## Remarks

- **"Diverges" here means "does not converge", and nothing more.** A divergent
  series may have partial sums that run away to $+\infty$, or to $-\infty$, or
  that oscillate without settling anywhere. The three behaviours are not
  distinguished by the word, and no statement on this page uses "diverges" to
  mean "the partial sums are unbounded" unless it says so.

- **The symbol $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k$ is defined only for a convergent
  series.** It denotes a real number, not a formal object, and it is illegitimate
  to write it down before convergence has been established. Where a proof needs
  to speak of the series without knowing whether it converges, it speaks of
  $(a_k)$ and of $(s_n)$.

- **Two indices, doing different work.** The index $k$ runs over the terms and is
  bound; the index $n$ runs over the partial sums and is the variable in which the
  limit is taken. Confusing them is the commonest slip in the subject, and it is
  the reason the definition above fixes $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ rather than
  $\sum_{k \le n} a_k$: with this choice the recursion $s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ is
  the one supplied by [[def-finite-sum]], with no shift anywhere.

## Statement

Let $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be sequences of reals, let
$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, and let $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, with finite sums and
finite products as in [[def-finite-sum]]. Then:

1. **Additivity.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k$.
2. **Scaling.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k$; in particular $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} \lambda = n\lambda$, where $n$ denotes the canonical natural $\iota(n) \in \mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).
3. **Splitting.** If $m \le n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k$, and $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n} a_k = \Big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k\Big)$.
4. **Monotonicity.** If $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$ then $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$. In particular, if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, every single term satisfies $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$ for $j < n$, and $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ forces $a_k = 0$ for every $k < n$.
5. **Telescoping.** $\displaystyle\sum_{k<n}\big(c_{k+1} - c_k\big) = c_n - c_0$.
6. **Products.** $\displaystyle\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k) = \Big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\Big)\Big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\Big)$; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k \ge 0$, and if $a_k > 0$ for all $k < n$ then $\prod_{k<n} a_k > 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $a, b, c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\lambda$, and naturals $m, n$. Write $\Sigma_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $\Pi_n = \prod_{k<n} a_k$.

[L1] Recursion clauses ([[def-finite-sum]]): $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ and $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n$; $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1$ and $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) \cdot a_n$; and $\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k = \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j}$ for $m \le n$, likewise for products.

[L2] Field axioms: addition and multiplication are associative and commutative, $0$ and $1$ are the identities, $x - x = 0$, and multiplication distributes over addition ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]); and $0 \cdot x = 0$, which is not an axiom but a lemma ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]).

[L3] Induction principle: a property holding at $0$ and inherited by successors holds at every natural ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L4] Adding inequalities: $x \le y$ and $u \le v$ imply $x + u \le y + v$. [[lem-of-add-order]] states the STRICT forms and only those ($x < y \Rightarrow x + c < y + c$, and $x < y$ with $u < v$ giving $x + u < y + v$); the nonstrict form used throughout below is those two together with the cases $x = y$ and $u = v$, which are settled by trichotomy, the order being total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L5] The canonical embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a field homomorphism, so $\iota(0) = 0$ and $\iota(n+1) = \iota(n) + 1$, and $\iota(n) > 0$ for $n \ge 1$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L6] Sign rules: a product of two positives is positive ([[lem-of-sign-rules]], claim 1), and a product of two nonnegatives is nonnegative, since a factor equal to $0$ makes the product $0$ ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]) and otherwise both factors are positive; and $1 > 0$, which is proved in [[cor-of-one-positive]] and stated by none of the items named above.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 0$: every claim holds at $n = 0$, since both sides of claim 1 are $0 = 0 + 0$, both sides of claim 2 are $0 = \lambda \cdot 0$ and $0 = \iota(0)\lambda$, claim 4 reads $0 \le 0$ with no term to bound and the hypothesis $\sum_{k<0} a_k = 0$ giving nothing to prove, claim 5 reads $0 = c_0 - c_0$, and claim 6 reads $1 = 1 \cdot 1$ with $1 > 0$. [base, L1, L2, L5, L6]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for this $n$ and for all sequences $a, b, c$ and all $\lambda$. [ih]

1.3 Splitting, claim 3, by a separate induction on the number of trailing terms $d = n - m$ with $m$ fixed: for $d = 0$ the claim reads $\sum_{k<m} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + 0$ and $\prod_{k<m} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<m} a_k\big) \cdot 1$, which hold; and if $\sum_{k<m+d} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d} a_{m+j}$, then $\sum_{k<m+d+1} a_k = \sum_{k<m+d} a_k + a_{m+d} = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \big(\sum_{j<d} a_{m+j} + a_{m+d}\big) = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{j<d+1} a_{m+j}$ by associativity, and identically for products with $1$ in place of $0$ and multiplication in place of addition, so induction on $d$ gives claim 3 for every $m \le n$. [L1, L2, L3]

2.1 Additivity at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k\big) + (a_n + b_n) = \big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) + \big(\sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n\big) = \sum_{k<n+1} a_k + \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$, using the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of addition. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Scaling at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda a_k = \sum_{k<n} \lambda a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda \sum_{k<n} a_k + \lambda a_n = \lambda\big(\sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n\big) = \lambda \sum_{k<n+1} a_k$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and distributivity; taking $a_k = 1$ for all $k$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} \lambda = \sum_{k<n} \lambda + \lambda = \iota(n)\lambda + \lambda = (\iota(n) + 1)\lambda = \iota(n+1)\lambda$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L5]

2.3 Monotonicity at $n+1$: assume $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n+1$; then $a_k \le b_k$ for all $k < n$, so the hypothesis gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \le \sum_{k<n} b_k$, and adding the inequality $a_n \le b_n$ gives $\sum_{k<n+1} a_k = \sum_{k<n} a_k + a_n \le \sum_{k<n} b_k + b_n = \sum_{k<n+1} b_k$. [step 1.2, L1, L4]

2.4 Telescoping at $n+1$: $\sum_{k<n+1}(c_{k+1} - c_k) = \sum_{k<n}(c_{k+1} - c_k) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = (c_n - c_0) + (c_{n+1} - c_n) = c_{n+1} - c_0$, by the recursion clause, the hypothesis and the field identities. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.5 Products at $n+1$: $\prod_{k<n+1}(a_k b_k) = \big(\prod_{k<n}(a_k b_k)\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n} b_k\big)(a_n b_n) = \big(\prod_{k<n+1} a_k\big)\big(\prod_{k<n+1} b_k\big)$ by the recursion clause, the hypothesis, and commutativity with associativity of multiplication; and if every $a_k \ge 0$ for $k < n+1$ then $\prod_{k<n+1} a_k = \big(\prod_{k<n} a_k\big) a_n$ is a product of two nonnegatives, hence nonnegative, with the same argument giving positivity from positivity since $\prod_{k<0} a_k = 1 > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L6]

3.1 Consequences of monotonicity, completing claim 4: monotonicity itself holds at every $n$, by the induction principle applied to the base case of step 1.1 and the successor step 2.3, so it is available for an arbitrary $n$ in what follows; if $a_k \ge 0$ for all $k < n$ then comparing with the zero sequence gives $\sum_{k<n} a_k \ge \sum_{k<n} 0 = 0$; for $j < n$ splitting at $j$ and then at $j+1$ writes $\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<j} a_k + a_j + \sum_{k=j+1}^{n-1} a_k$ with the first and third summands $\ge 0$, so $a_j \le \sum_{k<n} a_k$; and if moreover $\sum_{k<n} a_k = 0$ then $0 \le a_j \le 0$ for every $j < n$, so $a_j = 0$. [step 1.1, step 2.3, step 1.3, L3, L4, L2]

4.1 By the induction principle claims 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hold for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and claim 3 was proved in step 1.3 with its consequences in step 3.1, so all six laws hold. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.4, step 2.5, step 1.3, step 3.1, L3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field, with field structure as in [[def-field]], and for
$n \ge 1$ let $n \cdot 1_F$ denote the canonical natural number
$\underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$, defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$
and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$. Then for every $n \ge 1$:

- $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$;
- the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$;
- $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ and $(mn) \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F)$ for all $m, n \ge 1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ whose canonical naturals are defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, with $0 \cdot 1_F = 0$.

[L1] $0 < 1_F$ in every ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] The order is compatible with addition and positives are closed under addition: $a < b$ implies $a + c < b + c$, and $a > 0$, $b > 0$ imply $a + b > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 1$: by definition $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, and $1_F > 0$. [L1, base]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: assume $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for some fixed $n \ge 1$. [ih]

1.3 By the recursion, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F - n \cdot 1_F = 1_F > 0$, so $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$. [given, L1]

1.4 Additive identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ by the recursion, and if $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ then $(m+n+1) \cdot 1_F = (m+n) \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + (n+1) \cdot 1_F$. [given, algebra]

2.1 Inductive step: $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ is a sum of two positives, by the hypothesis and $1_F > 0$, hence $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Iterating 1.3, for $m < n$ one has $m \cdot 1_F < n \cdot 1_F$, so $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing and therefore injective on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$. [step 1.3, L2]

2.3 Multiplicative identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m \cdot 1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(1 \cdot 1_F)$, and the step $(m(n+1)) \cdot 1_F = (mn + m) \cdot 1_F = (mn) \cdot 1_F + m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F) + (m \cdot 1_F)(1_F) = (m \cdot 1_F)((n+1) \cdot 1_F)$ uses 1.4 and distributivity. [step 1.4, algebra]

3.1 By induction on 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for every $n \ge 1$; with the strict increase 2.2 and the identities 1.4, 2.3, every claim holds. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 1.4, step 2.3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $a, b$ be elements of a field ([[def-field]]) and let integer powers be as in
[[def-integer-power]].

1. For all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$: $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$.
2. If $a \ne 0$ then $a^n \ne 0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and $a^{-m} = (a^m)^{-1}$ for every $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ ([[def-int-operations]]).
3. If $a \ne 0$ and $b \ne 0$ then all three identities of claim 1 hold for all $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Elements $a, b$ of a field $F$, naturals $m, n, p, q, k$ and integers ranged over by $m, n$ in claims 2 and 3.

[L1] Definition of powers ([[def-integer-power]]): $a^0 = 1$ and $a^{n+1} = a^n a$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$; and $a^{-n} := (a^n)^{-1}$ for $a \ne 0$ and $n \ge 1$, the two clauses agreeing at $n = 0$.

[L2] Induction principle ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L3] Field arithmetic: multiplication is associative and commutative with identity $1$, and every nonzero element has an inverse ([[def-field]]); inverses are unique ([[lem-of-inverse-unique]], which states uniqueness and nothing further), and HENCE, for $x, y \ne 0$, $(xy)^{-1} = x^{-1} y^{-1}$ and $(x^{-1})^{-1} = x$, since $(xy)(x^{-1}y^{-1}) = 1$ and $x^{-1}x = 1$ exhibit inverses that uniqueness then identifies.

[L4] A field has no zero divisors: $xy = 0$ implies $x = 0$ or $y = 0$ ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]).

[L5] $\mathbb{Z}$ is a commutative ring in which every element is $\iota(k)$ or $-\iota(k)$ for a unique natural $k$ ([[thm-int-comm-ring]], [[lem-nat-embeds-int]], [[def-int-operations]]); we write $k$ for $\iota(k)$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base cases at $n = 0$ for the addition law, the product law and nonvanishing: $a^{m+0} = a^m = a^m \cdot 1 = a^m a^0$ for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$; $(ab)^0 = 1 = 1 \cdot 1 = a^0 b^0$; and if $a \ne 0$ then $a^0 = 1 \ne 0$. [base, L1, L3]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$ for all $m \in \mathbb{N}$, $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$, and $a^n \ne 0$ whenever $a \ne 0$. The iterated-power law $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ is deliberately NOT carried in this hypothesis: its successor step needs the addition law at the exponent pair $(mn, m)$, whose second entry is not the current stage, so that law must be finished first and the iterated law proved afterwards. [ih]

1.3 For $a \ne 0$ and every integer $j$, $a^{-j} = (a^j)^{-1}$: for $j \ge 0$ this is the definition together with the agreement of the two clauses at $j = 0$, and for $j = -k$ with $k \ge 1$ it reads $a^{k} = (a^{-k})^{-1}$, which holds because $a^{-k} = (a^k)^{-1}$ and $(x^{-1})^{-1} = x$ at $x = a^{k}$. That last substitution needs $a^{k} \ne 0$, which is NOT free here and must not be read off the definition, since the definition of the negative clause is what is being justified; it is instead a self-contained induction on $k$, from $a^{0} = 1 \ne 0$ and the fact that $a^{k+1} = a^{k}a$ is a product of two nonzero elements of a field, hence nonzero. [L1, L2, L3, L4, L5]

2.1 Successor step for the addition law, the product law and nonvanishing: $a^{m+(n+1)} = a^{(m+n)+1} = a^{m+n} a = (a^m a^n) a = a^m (a^n a) = a^m a^{n+1}$ for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$; $(ab)^{n+1} = (ab)^n (ab) = (a^n b^n)(ab) = (a^n a)(b^n b) = a^{n+1} b^{n+1}$; and if $a \ne 0$ then $a^{n+1} = a^n a$ is a product of two nonzero elements, hence nonzero. [step 1.2, L1, L3, L4]

3.1 By the induction principle, for all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$: $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$, and $a^n \ne 0$ whenever $a \ne 0$. The addition law is thereby available at EVERY pair of natural exponents, which is exactly what the iterated-power law needs. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L2]

4.1 The iterated-power law for natural exponents, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$, by a second induction on $n$ with $m \in \mathbb{N}$ fixed: at $n = 0$ both sides are $1$, since $(a^m)^0 = 1 = a^0 = a^{m \cdot 0}$; and if $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ then $(a^m)^{n+1} = (a^m)^n a^m = a^{mn} a^m = a^{mn+m} = a^{m(n+1)}$, where the third equality is the addition law of step 3.1 at the pair $(mn, m)$, legitimate precisely because that law is by now proved for all pairs of naturals. This completes claim 1. [step 3.1, L1, L2, L3]

4.2 For $a \ne 0$ and every integer $j$, $a^{j+1} = a^j a$: for $j \ge 0$ this is the recursion clause, and for $j = -k$ with $k \ge 1$ we compute $a^{-k} a = (a^k)^{-1} a = (a^{k-1} a)^{-1} a = (a^{k-1})^{-1} a^{-1} a = (a^{k-1})^{-1} = a^{-(k-1)} = a^{-k+1}$. [step 3.1, step 1.3, L1, L3]

4.3 For $a, b \ne 0$ the product law holds for all integers $n$: for $n \ge 0$ it is step 3.1, and for $n = -k$ with $k \ge 1$ we get $(ab)^{-k} = ((ab)^k)^{-1} = (a^k b^k)^{-1} = (a^k)^{-1}(b^k)^{-1} = a^{-k} b^{-k}$. [step 3.1, step 1.3, L3, L5]

5.1 For $a \ne 0$, every integer $j$ and every natural $k$, $a^{j+k} = a^j a^k$, by induction on $k$: the case $k = 0$ is $a^j = a^j \cdot 1$, and if $a^{j+k} = a^j a^k$ then $a^{j+k+1} = a^{j+k} a = a^j a^k a = a^j a^{k+1}$ by step 4.2 applied to the integer $j+k$ and by the recursion clause. [step 4.2, L1, L2, L3]

6.1 For $a \ne 0$ the addition law holds for all integers $m, n$: writing $n = k$ or $n = -k$ with $k \in \mathbb{N}$, the case $n = k$ is step 5.1, while for $n = -k$ step 5.1 applied to the integer $m - k$ gives $a^m = a^{(m-k)+k} = a^{m-k} a^k$, hence $a^{m-k} = a^m (a^k)^{-1} = a^m a^{-k}$. [step 5.1, step 1.3, L3, L5]

7.1 For $a \ne 0$ the iterated-power law holds for all integers $m, n$: for $n \ge 0$ induction on $n$ gives $(a^m)^{n+1} = (a^m)^n a^m = a^{mn} a^m = a^{mn+m} = a^{m(n+1)}$, the third equality by the integer addition law of step 6.1 at the pair $(mn, m)$, with base $(a^m)^0 = 1 = a^0$; and for $n = -q$ with $q \ge 1$, $(a^m)^{-q} = ((a^m)^q)^{-1} = (a^{mq})^{-1} = a^{-mq} = a^{m(-q)}$, using that $a^m \ne 0$ by step 3.1 and step 1.3. [step 6.1, step 3.1, step 1.3, L2, L3, L5]

8.1 Claims 1, 2 and 3 are therefore established: the addition, product and iterated-power laws for natural exponents together with nonvanishing by steps 3.1 and 4.1, the identity $a^{-m} = (a^m)^{-1}$ by step 1.3, and the three integer-exponent laws by steps 6.1, 4.3 and 7.1. [step 3.1, step 4.1, step 1.3, step 6.1, step 4.3, step 7.1, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ be sequences of reals whose series converge
([[def-series]]), and let $c \in \mathbb{R}$. Then:

1. $\sum (a_k + b_k)$ converges, with
   $\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k + \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} b_k$;
2. $\sum c\,a_k$ converges, with
   $\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c\,a_k = c \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k$.

Moreover, for $c \ne 0$ and an arbitrary sequence $(a_k)$, whose series is not
assumed to converge:

3. $\sum c\,a_k$ converges **if and only if** $\sum a_k$ converges. Equivalently,
   $\sum a_k$ diverges if and only if $\sum c\,a_k$ diverges.

Claim 3 is the form used whenever a comparison is made against a constant
multiple of a known series.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $(a_k)$, $(b_k)$ of reals and $c \in \mathbb{R}$, with partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ and $t_n = \sum_{k<n} b_k$ ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[L1] Additivity and scaling of finite sums: $\sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) = \sum_{k<n} a_k + \sum_{k<n} b_k$ and $\sum_{k<n} c\,a_k = c \sum_{k<n} a_k$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L2] Algebra of limits: if $x_n \to x$ and $y_n \to y$ then $x_n + y_n \to x + y$ and $c\,x_n \to c\,x$ ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The partial sums of $\sum (a_k + b_k)$ are $\sum_{k<n}(a_k + b_k) = s_n + t_n$, and those of $\sum c\,a_k$ are $\sum_{k<n} c\,a_k = c\,s_n$. [given, L1]

1.2 Assume $\sum a_k$ and $\sum b_k$ converge, say $s_n \to S$ and $t_n \to T$. [given]

2.1 Then $s_n + t_n \to S + T$, so $\sum(a_k + b_k)$ converges with sum $S + T$, which is claim 1. [step 1.2, step 1.1, L2]

2.2 Likewise $c\,s_n \to c\,S$, so $\sum c\,a_k$ converges with sum $c\,S$, which is claim 2. [step 1.2, step 1.1, L2]

3.1 For claim 3, let $c \ne 0$ and let $(a_k)$ be arbitrary. If $\sum a_k$ converges then $\sum c\,a_k$ converges by claim 2. [step 2.2]

3.2 Conversely, if $\sum c\,a_k$ converges then applying claim 2 to the sequence $(c\,a_k)$ and the scalar $1/c$, which exists since $c \ne 0$, shows that $\sum (1/c)(c\,a_k) = \sum a_k$ converges. [step 2.2, algebra]

4.1 The two implications are claim 3, and its contrapositive form is the statement about divergence. [step 3.1, step 3.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **There is no product rule here, and there is no rule for $\sum a_k b_k$.** The proof works because a finite sum is additive and homogeneous, and neither property has an analogue for products. Multiplying series is a genuinely harder question, requiring absolute convergence, and it is not treated on this page.

- **Claim 3 needs $c \ne 0$ and nothing else.** In particular it does not need either series to converge, which is what makes it usable in the divergence direction: scaling a divergent series by a nonzero constant leaves it divergent.

## Statement

Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals with partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$, let
$N \in \mathbb{N}$, and let $t_j := \sum_{i<j} a_{N+i}$ be the partial sums of the
$N$-th tail series $\sum_{k \ge N} a_k$ ([[def-series]]). Then:

1. $t_j = s_{j+N} - s_N$ for every $j \in \mathbb{N}$;
2. $\sum a_k$ converges **if and only if** its $N$-th tail series converges, and
   in that case
   $$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k \;=\; s_N \;+\; \sum_{k=N}^{\infty} a_k ;$$
3. hence the following are equivalent: $\sum a_k$ converges; every tail series of
   $\sum a_k$ converges; some tail series of $\sum a_k$ converges.

In words: convergence of a series is a property of its terms from any index on,
and changing finitely many terms changes the sum but not the fact of convergence.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(a_k)$ of reals, a natural number $N$, the partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ and the partial sums $t_j = \sum_{i<j} a_{N+i}$ of the $N$-th tail series ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[L1] Splitting of finite sums: if $m \le n$ then $\sum_{k<n} a_k = \sum_{k<m} a_k + \sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]), and $\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k$ is by definition $\sum_{i<n-m} a_{m+i}$ ([[def-finite-sum]]).

[L2] Convergence depends only on the tail: a sequence $(x_n)$ converges to $x$ if and only if its $N$-th tail $(x_{j+N})_{j}$ converges to $x$ ([[lem-limit-of-tail]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L3] Algebra of limits: if $x_j \to x$ and $y_j \to y$ then $x_j + y_j \to x + y$ and $x_j - y_j \to x - y$ ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]]).

[L4] A constant sequence $y_j = c$ converges to $c$, immediately from the definition of a limit ([[def-real-limit]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Fix $j \in \mathbb{N}$ and put $n := j + N$, so that $N \le n$ and $n - N = j$. [given]

1.2 The family $(s_{j+N})_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ is the $N$-th tail of the sequence $(s_n)$ of partial sums. [given, L2]

2.1 Splitting the partial sum $s_n$ at $N$ gives $s_n = \sum_{k<N} a_k + \sum_{k=N}^{n-1} a_k = s_N + \sum_{i<j} a_{N+i} = s_N + t_j$. [step 1.1, L1]

2.2 Suppose $\sum a_k$ converges, say $s_n \to S$; then the $N$-th tail $(s_{j+N})_j$ converges to $S$. [given, step 1.2, L2]

3.1 Claim 1 follows: $t_j = s_{j+N} - s_N$ for every $j \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.1, algebra]

4.1 The constant sequence with value $s_N$ converges to $s_N$, so $t_j = s_{j+N} - s_N \to S - s_N$, and the $N$-th tail series converges with sum $S - s_N$. [step 2.2, step 3.1, L3, L4]

4.2 Conversely, suppose the $N$-th tail series converges, say $t_j \to T$; then $s_{j+N} = s_N + t_j \to s_N + T$ by the same two rules. [step 3.1, L3, L4]

5.1 So the $N$-th tail of $(s_n)$ converges to $s_N + T$, hence $(s_n)$ itself converges to $s_N + T$ and $\sum a_k$ converges. [step 4.2, step 1.2, L2]

6.1 Claim 2 follows: the two convergences are equivalent, and when they hold the sums are related by $S = s_N + T$, which is the displayed identity. [step 4.1, step 5.1, algebra]

7.1 Claim 3 follows as well: if $\sum a_k$ converges then by claim 2 every tail series converges; every tail series converging trivially gives some tail series converging, the family of tails being indexed by all of $\mathbb{N}$; and if some tail series, say the $N$-th, converges then by claim 2 again $\sum a_k$ converges. [step 6.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the hypothesis-free character comes from.** Nothing here assumes the terms have a sign or that any series converges: claim 1 is an identity between finite sums, valid always, and claims 2 and 3 are read off from it by two standard limit rules. That is why the lemma may be used to move between a series and its tails inside proofs that have not yet decided the convergence question.

- **The sum does change.** Only the fact of convergence is tail invariant. The identity in claim 2 is the exact bookkeeping: discarding the first $N$ terms lowers the sum by $s_N$, and no more.

Let $b \in \mathbb{N}$ with $b \ge 2$ and write $\beta := \iota(b)$ for the
canonical natural of $b$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-canonical-natural]]), so that
$\beta > 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]); powers $\beta^{\,n}$ are integer
powers ([[def-integer-power]]). Call a sequence $(d_j)$ of natural numbers a
**digit sequence in base $b$** when $d_j < b$ for every $j$, and say it is

with $d_j = b-1$ for every $j \ge J$. Then:

1. **Existence.** For every $x \in [0,1)$ ([[def-interval]]) there is a
   non-terminal digit sequence $(d_j)$ in base $b$ with
   $$\sum_{j \ge 0} \frac{\iota(d_j)}{\beta^{\,j+1}} \ \text{ convergent, of sum } \ x .$$
2. **Uniqueness.** If $(c_j)$ and $(c'_j)$ are non-terminal digit sequences in
   base $b$ whose series have the same sum, then $c_j = c'_j$ for every $j$.

So every real in $[0,1)$ has exactly one base-$b$ expansion once the terminal
sequences are excluded. The assignment $x \mapsto (d_j)$ is moreover a bijection
onto the non-terminal digit sequences: claim 2 makes it injective, and it is onto
because a non-terminal $(c_j)$ has $\iota(c_j) \le \beta - 1$ for every $j$ and
$\iota(c_j) < \beta - 1$ for infinitely many $j$, so its sum is strictly below the
sum $1$ of the all-$(b-1)$ series computed in step 8.1, hence lies in $[0,1)$ and
has $(c_j)$ as its expansion by claim 2. Excluding them is unavoidable: the terminal
sequences are exactly the ones producing a second expansion of a number that
already has one, as the companion examples page exhibits with
$0.999\dots = 1$ and $0.4999\dots = 0.5$.

**The construction uses no floor function.** The integer part of a real is not
available at this point in the reading order, so the digit at each stage is
produced by the finite case distinction "in which of the $b$ intervals
$[\,d/\beta,\ (d+1)/\beta\,)$ does the current residue lie", closed by the
well-ordering principle ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]), and the digits are
assembled by the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]).

**Indices run from $0$.** The digit $d_j$ carries the weight $\beta^{-(j+1)}$, so
that the first digit has weight $1/\beta$ and no denominator $\beta^{\,0} = 1$
ever occurs.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A natural number $b \ge 2$, $\beta = \iota(b)$, and a real $x \in [0,1)$.

[L1] The canonical natural: $\iota(0) = 0$, $\iota(n+1) = \iota(n) + 1$, $\iota$ is strictly increasing on $\mathbb{N}$, and $\iota(m+n) = \iota(m) + \iota(n)$ ([[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L2] Integer powers: $\beta^0 = 1$, $\beta^{n+1} = \beta^{\,n}\beta$, $(uv)^n = u^n v^n$, and $\beta^{\,n} > 0$ for $\beta > 0$ ([[def-integer-power]], [[lem-power-laws]]).

[L3] $[0,1) = \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : 0 \le y < 1 \,\}$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L4] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L5] The recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) and the principle of induction ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L6] Geometric series: for $|r| < 1$, $\sum r^k$ converges with sum $1/(1-r)$; and the terms of a convergent series tend to $0$ ([[thm-geometric-series]], [[lem-nth-term-test]]).

[L7] Order and inverses: $0 < u < v$ implies $0 < 1/v < 1/u$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

[L8] Finite sums: recursion, splitting, additivity, scaling and monotonicity; in particular every single term of a finite sum of nonnegative reals is at most that sum ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L9] Partial sums and sums of series; linearity of convergent series; and a series converges if and only if some tail series converges, the sum being the initial partial sum plus the tail sum ([[def-series]], [[lem-series-linearity]], [[lem-series-tail-invariance]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L10] For a series of nonnegative terms, every partial sum is at most the sum ([[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]]).

[L11] The squeeze theorem, the algebra of limits, and that limits preserve non-strict inequalities ([[thm-squeeze]], [[thm-algebra-of-limits]], [[lem-limit-preserves-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 $\beta = \iota(b) \ge \iota(2) = 1 + 1 > 1 > 0$, and an induction gives $\beta^{\,n} > 0$ for every $n$; also $0 < 1/\beta < 1$. [given, L1, L2, L5, L7]

1.2 For uniqueness, let $(c_j)$ and $(c'_j)$ be non-terminal digit sequences whose series have the same sum, and suppose they are not equal. By [L4] let $n$ be least with $c_n \ne c'_n$; interchanging the two sequences if necessary, assume $c_n < c'_n$, so $\iota(c'_n) - \iota(c_n) \ge 1$. [given, L1, L4, choose]

2.1 **The digit of a residue.** For every $r \in [0,1)$ there is exactly one natural $d < b$ with $\iota(d)/\beta \le r < \iota(d+1)/\beta$. For existence, the set $D := \{\, d \in \mathbb{N} : d \le b \text{ and } r < \iota(d)/\beta \,\}$ contains $b$, since $\iota(b)/\beta = 1 > r$; let $m := \min D$, which is not $0$ because $\iota(0)/\beta = 0 \le r$; put $d := m - 1$, so $d < b$, and minimality of $m$ says $d \notin D$, that is $\iota(d)/\beta \le r$, while $m \in D$ says $r < \iota(m)/\beta = \iota(d+1)/\beta$. For uniqueness, if $d < d'$ both worked then $r < \iota(d+1)/\beta \le \iota(d')/\beta \le r$, which the order forbids. Write $d(r)$ for this digit. [step 1.1, L1, L3, L4, construct]

2.2 Both series converge, by hypothesis, so by linearity $\sum_j \bigl(\iota(c'_j) - \iota(c_j)\bigr)/\beta^{\,j+1}$ converges with sum $0$; its first $n$ terms vanish, so by [L9] the tail from $n$ also has sum $0$, that is $0 = \bigl(\iota(c'_n)-\iota(c_n)\bigr)/\beta^{\,n+1} + \sum_{j > n}\bigl(\iota(c'_j)-\iota(c_j)\bigr)/\beta^{\,j+1}$. [given, step 1.2, L9]

3.1 **The residue map.** For $r \in [0,1)$ put $f(r) := \beta r - \iota(d(r))$. Multiplying $\iota(d(r))/\beta \le r < \iota(d(r)+1)/\beta = (\iota(d(r)) + 1)/\beta$ by $\beta > 0$ gives $\iota(d(r)) \le \beta r < \iota(d(r)) + 1$, so $0 \le f(r) < 1$; thus $f$ is a function from $[0,1)$ to $[0,1)$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L1, L3, construct]

3.2 Every difference satisfies $\iota(c'_j) - \iota(c_j) \ge -(\beta - 1)$, the digits lying in $\{0,\dots,b-1\}$, and $\sum_{j>n}(\beta-1)/\beta^{\,j+1} = \frac{\beta-1}{\beta^{\,n+2}}\cdot\frac{1}{1-1/\beta} = \frac{1}{\beta^{\,n+1}}$ by the geometric series; hence the tail in step 2.2 is at least $-1/\beta^{\,n+1}$. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L6, L11]

4.1 By the recursion theorem applied to the set $[0,1)$, the element $x$ and the function $f$, there is a unique sequence $(r_n)$ in $[0,1)$ with $r_0 = x$ and $r_{n+1} = f(r_n)$; put $d_j := d(r_j)$, a natural number $< b$, so $(d_j)$ is a digit sequence in base $b$. [step 3.1, L5, construct]

4.2 Write $A$ for the first summand and $B$ for the tail in step 2.2, so $A + B = 0$ while $A \ge 1/\beta^{\,n+1}$ by step 1.2 and $B \ge -1/\beta^{\,n+1}$ by step 3.2; since the two lower bounds sum to $0$, both must be attained, that is $A = 1/\beta^{\,n+1}$ and $B = -1/\beta^{\,n+1}$; in particular $\sum_{j>n}\bigl(\iota(c'_j)-\iota(c_j) + (\beta-1)\bigr)/\beta^{\,j+1} = 0$, a convergent series of nonnegative terms with sum $0$, so every term is $0$ and $\iota(c'_j) - \iota(c_j) = -(\beta-1)$ for every $j > n$. [step 1.2, step 2.2, step 3.2, L8, L9, L10]

5.1 An induction gives $x = \sum_{j<n} \iota(d_j)/\beta^{\,j+1} + r_n/\beta^{\,n}$ for every $n$: at $n = 0$ the sum is empty and $r_0/\beta^0 = x$; and from $r_n = (\iota(d_n) + r_{n+1})/\beta$, which is step 3.1 rearranged, one gets $r_n/\beta^{\,n} = \iota(d_n)/\beta^{\,n+1} + r_{n+1}/\beta^{\,n+1}$. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L2, L5, L8]

5.2 Since $0 \le r_n < 1$ and $\beta^{\,n} > 0$, we have $0 \le r_n/\beta^{\,n} \le 1/\beta^{\,n} = (1/\beta)^n$; as $0 < 1/\beta < 1$ the series $\sum (1/\beta)^k$ converges, so $(1/\beta)^n \to 0$, and the squeeze gives $r_n/\beta^{\,n} \to 0$. [step 1.1, step 4.1, L2, L6, L7, L11]

5.3 That forces $c_j = b-1$ and $c'_j = 0$ for every $j > n$, since the difference of two digits attains $-(\beta-1)$ only at those values; so $(c_j)$ is terminal, contrary to hypothesis. Hence the two digit sequences agree, which is claim 2. [step 1.2, step 4.2, L1]

6.1 By step 5.1 the partial sums of $\sum_j \iota(d_j)/\beta^{\,j+1}$ equal $x - r_n/\beta^{\,n}$, which converges to $x$; so the series converges with sum $x$. [step 5.1, step 5.2, L9, L11]

7.1 Applying step 5.1 and step 6.1 to the residue $r_J$ in place of $x$, whose recursion produces the digits $d_{J+i}$, gives $r_J = \sum_{i \ge 0} \iota(d_{J+i})/\beta^{\,i+1}$ for every $J$. [step 4.1, step 6.1, L5]

8.1 The constructed sequence is not terminal: if $d_j = b-1$ for every $j \ge J$, then by step 7.1 and the geometric series, $r_J = \sum_{i\ge0} (\beta-1)/\beta^{\,i+1} = \frac{\beta-1}{\beta}\cdot\frac{1}{1 - 1/\beta} = 1$, contradicting $r_J < 1$; here $\iota(b-1) = \beta - 1$ by [L1]. With step 6.1 this proves claim 1. [step 6.1, step 7.1, L1, L2, L6, L9]

9.1 Claim 1 is step 6.1 with step 8.1 and claim 2 is step 5.3, so every $x \in [0,1)$ has exactly one non-terminal base-$b$ expansion. [step 6.1, step 8.1, step 5.3, discharge-construct] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where each tool is used, and the floor function is not among them.** The well-ordering principle appears once, in step 2.1, to pick out the digit from the finitely many candidates $0, \dots, b$; the recursion theorem appears once, in step 4.1, to turn the one-step residue map into a sequence. Everything else is the geometric series and the ordering of $\mathbb{R}$. The usual formula $d_n = \lfloor \beta r_n \rfloor$ would need the integer part of a real, which is developed later in the reading order.

- **The exclusion of terminal sequences is exactly one equivalence class.** Step 4.2 shows that two distinct expansions of the same number must differ by one at the first place where they differ and then be all $b-1$ against all $0$. So each real in $(0,1)$ whose expansion terminates in zeros has exactly two expansions and every other real exactly one; forbidding the all-$(b-1)$ tails picks one from each pair.

- **The hypothesis $x < 1$ is not a restriction on the theorem so much as on the notation.** The all-$(b-1)$ sequence sums to $1$, as step 8.1 computes, and $1$ is not in $[0,1)$; a base-$b$ expansion of a general nonnegative real is an integer part together with an expansion of the fractional part, and the integer part is not available here.

## Statement

Let $r \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $r^k$ be the integer power ([[def-integer-power]]),
so that $r^0 = 1$ for every $r$, including $r = 0$.

1. If $|r| < 1$ then the series $\sum r^k$ converges ([[def-series]]) and
   $$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} r^{k} \;=\; \frac{1}{1-r} .$$
2. If $|r| \ge 1$ then $\sum r^k$ diverges.

The series starts at $k = 0$ and its first term is $r^0 = 1$; in particular
$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} 2^{-k} = 2$, while the series starting at $k = 1$ sums to
$1$. Which starting index is meant has to be said, and it is said here.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real number $r$, the integer powers $r^k$ ([[def-integer-power]]), and the partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k<n} r^k$ of $\sum r^k$ ([[def-series]], [[def-finite-sum]]).

[L1] Factorisation of a difference of powers: for $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and natural $n \ge 1$, $b^n - a^n = (b-a)\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a^k b^{\,n-1-k}$ ([[lem-power-difference-factorisation]]).

[L2] For $|r| < 1$ the sequence $(r^k)$ is null, that is $r^k \to 0$ ([[lem-geometric-sequence-null]]).

[L3] Algebra of limits: sums, differences and quotients of convergent sequences converge to the corresponding combination, the quotient rule requiring a nonzero limit and nonzero denominators ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L4] Absolute value: $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$, $|x| \ge 0$, and $|x| = 0$ exactly when $x = 0$; also $|1| = 1$, since $1 > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L5] Powers and order: $a^0 = 1$ for every $a$; if $a \ge 1$ and $n \ge 1$ then $a^n \ge a \ge 1$; and $1^n = 1$ for every $n$ ([[lem-power-monotone]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L6] The principle of induction ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L7] If a series converges then its terms tend to $0$ ([[lem-nth-term-test]]).

[L8] Notation of [[def-finite-sum]]: $\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x_k$ is $\sum_{k<n} x_k$, and the empty sum $\sum_{k<0} x_k$ is $0$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Assume $|r| < 1$. [assume-case lt]

1.2 Assume instead $|r| \ge 1$. [assume-case ge]

1.3 For every natural $n \ge 1$, applying [L1] with $b = 1$ and $a = r$ gives $1 - r^n = (1-r)\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} r^k \cdot 1^{\,n-1-k} = (1-r)\,s_n$, using $1^m = 1$ and the notation of [L8]. [L1, L5, L8]

1.4 At $n = 0$ the identity $1 - r^n = (1-r)s_n$ also holds, both sides being $0$ because $r^0 = 1$ and $s_0$ is the empty sum. [L5, L8]

2.1 In the case $|r| < 1$ we have $r \ne 1$, since $|1| = 1$ and $|r| < 1$; hence $1 - r \ne 0$. [step 1.1, L4, algebra]

2.2 In the case $|r| \ge 1$, an induction gives $|r^k| = |r|^k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$: at $k = 0$ both sides are $1$, and if $|r^k| = |r|^k$ then $|r^{k+1}| = |r^k \cdot r| = |r^k|\,|r| = |r|^k |r| = |r|^{k+1}$. [step 1.2, L4, L5, L6]

2.3 In the case $|r| \ge 1$ we get $|r|^k \ge 1$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$: at $k = 0$ this reads $1 \ge 1$, and for $k \ge 1$ it is the comparison $|r|^k \ge |r| \ge 1$. [step 1.2, L5]

3.1 In the case $|r| < 1$, dividing by $1 - r \ne 0$ gives $s_n = (1 - r^n)/(1-r)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.1, step 1.3, step 1.4, algebra]

3.2 In the case $|r| \ge 1$, combining the two previous steps gives $|r^k - 0| = |r^k| = |r|^k \ge 1$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.2, step 2.3]

4.1 In the case $|r| < 1$ the sequence $(r^n)$ is null, so $1 - r^n \to 1$ and therefore $s_n \to 1/(1-r)$, the denominator being the nonzero constant $1-r$; hence $\sum r^k$ converges with sum $1/(1-r)$, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 3.1, step 2.1, L2, L3]

4.2 In the case $|r| \ge 1$ the sequence $(r^k)$ does not converge to $0$, since the rational tolerance $\varepsilon = 1$ admits no index $K$ with $|r^k - 0| < 1$ for all $k \ge K$; so by the term test $\sum r^k$ diverges, which is claim 2. [step 3.2, L7]

5.1 The two cases $|r| < 1$ and $|r| \ge 1$ exhaust the possibilities, since the order on $\mathbb{R}$ is total, so claims 1 and 2 together cover every real $r$. [step 4.1, step 4.2, cases-exhaustive] ∎

## Remarks

- **The divergence half needs no separate treatment of $r = 1$ and $r = -1$.** Both are covered by $|r| \ge 1$, and the single reason is the same in every case: the terms have absolute value at least $1$, so they cannot tend to $0$. For $r = 1$ the partial sums are $s_n = n$ and run to $+\infty$; for $r = -1$ they oscillate between $0$ and $1$. The theorem says only that neither converges, which is all that "diverges" means here ([[def-series]]).

- **Why the identity is proved at $n = 0$ separately.** [[lem-power-difference-factorisation]] requires $n \ge 1$, since its right-hand side is a sum over $k < n$ of a term involving $b^{\,n-1-k}$, and $n-1$ is not a natural number at $n = 0$. The identity is still true at $n = 0$, but by inspection of two empty objects rather than by that lemma, and step 1.4 says so rather than letting the reader assume the citation covers it.
