You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as a
read-only adversarial proof-refuter for the published-page audit. You are
tool-less: you cannot open a file, run a command, browse, edit, or delegate.
Everything you may rely on is reproduced in the `This dispatch` section. Return
evidence only; Audit-Alpha alone adjudicates and edits.

## Triage — the standing rule (verbatim, binding on you)

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct
  citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

## Adversarial standard

Read the target's title, Statement/Definition/Example/Statement refuted, Facts &
Assumptions, every numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks.
Try to falsify the public claim and every load-bearing inference.

1. Compare every cited fact with the supplied source text before alleging that
   it is weak. Check domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, direction, conclusion,
   and whether the source licenses the exact use.
2. Check that the title and public statement assert no more than the proof
   establishes, and that every proof step uses only available premises.
3. Check both directions of biconditionals, uniqueness/existence claims,
   induction and limiting arguments, empty/zero/endpoint/degenerate cases,
   extended-real conventions, index shifts, and hidden division or choice.
4. Re-read Remarks as skeptically as a numbered step. A false mathematical
   remark is a defect even when the proof is sound.
5. When the target is marked `ai-generated`, actively search for a
   counterexample to its claim, witness, or refutation rather than merely
   checking prose consistency.
6. Treat a false public claim, logically invalid proof, missing necessary
   hypothesis, circularity, or materially inaccurate load-bearing citation as
   fatal. Do not inflate an expository omission or a gap closable within thirty
   seconds into a defect.

## Output format

Reply with exactly this structure and no preamble:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

If `DEFECTS`, give one block per finding:

```text

  location: [exact title, section, fact label, or numbered step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [the exact mathematical assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, missing hypothesis, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]

## Statement

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a \le b$, let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be
continuous on the closed bounded interval $[a,b]$ ([[def-interval]],
[[def-continuity-real]]), and let $y \in \mathbb{R}$ satisfy

$$f(a) \le y \le f(b) \qquad \text{or} \qquad f(b) \le y \le f(a) .$$

Then there is $c \in [a,b]$ with $f(c) = y$.

**The construction is canonical, so no choice principle is used.** The bisection
below tests the left half first and takes the right half only when the left one
has been ruled out, so the passage from one interval to the next is a *function*
of that interval, and [[thm-recursion]] applies with nothing selected. This is
the same discipline the library uses wherever a sequence is built one term at a
time.

**Completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ is what does the work.** The bisection produces a
nested sequence of closed bounded intervals whose lengths tend to $0$, and it is
[[thm-nested-interval-property]] — hence the least-upper-bound property — that
supplies the point. Over an ordered field that is not complete the theorem
fails; the witness for that, stated for an arbitrary ordered field and worked
over $\mathbb{Q}$, is
[[cex-evt-and-ivt-fail-over-a-non-complete-field]], which states its own
$\varepsilon$-$\delta$ continuity inline and is not an instance of this page's
definition.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a \le b$, a function $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ continuous on $[a,b]$, and a real $y$ with $f(a) \le y \le f(b)$ or $f(b) \le y \le f(a)$.

[L1] Scalar multiples of continuous functions are continuous, so $(-1)f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L2] Recursion: for a set $X$, an element $x_0 \in X$ and a function $F : X \to X$ there is a unique $g : \mathbb{N} \to X$ with $g(0) = x_0$ and $g(k+1) = F(g(k))$ for every $k$ ([[thm-recursion]]).

[L3] Nested intervals: if $I_k = [a_k,b_k]$ with $a_k \le b_k$ and $I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, then $\bigcap_{k} I_k$ is nonempty, and it is a single point exactly when the lengths $b_k - a_k$ tend to $0$ ([[thm-nested-interval-property]], [[def-interval]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L4] Null geometric sequences: $|r| < 1$ implies $r^{k} \to 0$; and a constant multiple of a null sequence is null, while a constant sequence converges to that constant ([[lem-geometric-sequence-null]], [[thm-algebra-of-limits]], [[def-integer-power]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L5] Powers: $(2^{-1})^{k} = (2^{k})^{-1}$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[lem-power-laws]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L6] Sequential criterion, the choice-free direction: if $f$ is continuous at $c$ and $x_k \in [a,b]$ with $x_k \to c$, then $f(x_k) \to f(c)$ ([[thm-sequential-criterion-for-continuity]], [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L7] Limits preserve non-strict inequalities ([[lem-limit-preserves-order]]).

[L8] Order and field arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: trichotomy and totality, so exactly one of $f(m) \ge y$ and $f(m) < y$ holds; halving and the ordered-field identities ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]); and $|t| \le s$ whenever $-s \le t \le s$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 **Reduction.** It is enough to prove the theorem under the hypothesis $f(a) \le y \le f(b)$. Indeed, in the remaining case $f(b) \le y \le f(a)$, put $h := (-1)f$ and $z := -y$; then $h$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ by [L1] and $h(a) = -f(a) \le -y = z \le -f(b) = h(b)$, so a point $c \in [a,b]$ with $h(c) = z$ is a point with $f(c) = y$. [L1, L8, suffices: assume f(a) le y le f(b)]

1.2 **The bisection map.** Assume $f(a) \le y \le f(b)$ and put $$X \;:=\; \bigl\{\, (u,v) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \ : \ a \le u \le v \le b,\ f(u) \le y \le f(v) \,\bigr\},$$ so $(a,b) \in X$. For $(u,v) \in X$ write $m := (u+v)/2$, which satisfies $a \le u \le m \le v \le b$ and so lies in $[a,b]$, and define $$F(u,v) \;:=\; \begin{cases} (u,\ m) & \text{if } f(m) \ge y,\\ (m,\ v) & \text{if } f(m) < y. \end{cases}$$ By trichotomy exactly one clause applies, so $F$ is a function on $X$; and $F(u,v) \in X$ in both clauses, since in the first $f(u) \le y \le f(m)$ and in the second $f(m) \le y \le f(v)$. **The left half is tested first and the right half is taken only when the left is excluded, so nothing is selected.** [L8, construct]

2.1 **The nested sequence.** By [L2] applied to $X$, the element $(a,b)$ and the map $F$, there is a unique $g : \mathbb{N} \to X$ with $g(0) = (a,b)$ and $g(k+1) = F(g(k))$. Write $g(k) = (a_k,b_k)$ and $I_k := [a_k,b_k]$. Then for every $k$: $a \le a_k \le b_k \le b$ and $f(a_k) \le y \le f(b_k)$, because $g(k) \in X$; and $I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k$, since in either clause of the definition of $F$ the new endpoints lie in $[a_k,b_k]$ and the new interval is $[a_k,m_k]$ or $[m_k,b_k]$ with $m_k = (a_k+b_k)/2$. [step 1.2, L2, L8]

3.1 **The lengths.** In both clauses the new length is $m_k - a_k = (b_k - a_k)/2$ or $b_k - m_k = (b_k - a_k)/2$, so $b_{k+1} - a_{k+1} = (b_k - a_k)/2$; with $b_0 - a_0 = b - a$ an induction on $k$ gives $b_k - a_k = (b-a)\,(2^{-1})^{k}$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, that is $(b-a)/2^{k}$ by [L5]. Since $|2^{-1}| < 1$, [L4] gives $(2^{-1})^{k} \to 0$ and hence $b_k - a_k \to 0$. [step 2.1, L4, L5, L8]

4.1 **The point.** By [L3] applied to the nested family $(I_k)$, whose lengths tend to $0$ by step 3.1, the intersection $\bigcap_k I_k$ is a single point; call it $c$. Then $c \in I_0 = [a,b]$ and $a_k \le c \le b_k$ for every $k$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, L3, construct]

5.1 **The endpoints converge to $c$.** Let a rational $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. By step 3.1 there is $K$ with $b_k - a_k < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$. For such $k$, from $a_k \le c \le b_k$ we get $-(b_k - a_k) \le a_k - c \le 0$ and $0 \le b_k - c \le b_k - a_k$, so $|a_k - c| \le b_k - a_k < \varepsilon$ and $|b_k - c| \le b_k - a_k < \varepsilon$ by [L8]. Hence $a_k \to c$ and $b_k \to c$. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L8]

6.1 **Passing to the limit.** The point $c$ lies in $[a,b]$, so $f$ is continuous at $c$, and [L6] applied to the two sequences of step 5.1 gives $f(a_k) \to f(c)$ and $f(b_k) \to f(c)$. [step 4.1, step 5.1, L6]

7.1 By step 2.1, $f(a_k) \le y$ for every $k$; the constant sequence with value $y$ converges to $y$ by [L4], so [L7] gives $f(c) \le y$. Likewise $y \le f(b_k)$ for every $k$ gives $y \le f(c)$. Hence $f(c) = y$. [step 2.1, step 6.1, L4, L7, L8]

8.1 A point $c \in [a,b]$ with $f(c) = y$ has therefore been constructed, under the reduction of step 1.1 and hence in both cases of the hypothesis. [step 1.1, step 4.1, step 7.1, discharge-construct: c is the unique point of the nested intersection] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the left half is tested first.** The bisection has to choose one of two halves at every stage, and if the rule were "choose a half in which the sign change persists" the construction would be a dependent choice, not a recursion. Testing $f(m) \ge y$ and taking the left half in that case makes the successor a function of its predecessor, so [[thm-recursion]] applies verbatim. The same device is used in [[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]] and in the bisection proof of Heine-Borel.

- **What the theorem does *not* say.** It does not say that $c$ is unique, and it does not say that the set of solutions is an interval; $f$ may take the value $y$ on a complicated set. It also does not say that a function with the intermediate value property is continuous — that converse is false, and the witness for it needs machinery that is not available at this point in the reading order.

- **Only the choice-free direction of the sequential criterion is used.** Step 6.1 turns a convergent sequence into a convergent image sequence, which is the implication proved in ZF ([[thm-sequential-criterion-for-continuity]]); the converse, which spends countable choice, is never invoked here.

## Statement refuted

**The notion of continuity used here is stated in full, and is not imported.**
Let $F$ be an ordered field, $D \subseteq F$ and $\varphi : D \to F$. Say
$\varphi$ is **continuous at** $c \in D$ when

$$\text{for every } \varepsilon > 0 \text{ in } F \text{ there is } \delta > 0 \text{ in } F \text{ with } |\varphi(x) - \varphi(c)| < \varepsilon \text{ whenever } x \in D \text{ and } |x - c| < \delta,$$

and **continuous on $D$** when it is continuous at every point of $D$. This is
the ordinary $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ condition, read entirely inside $F$. Nothing
below cites a definition of continuity from elsewhere in this library, because
there is none yet.

**Refuted claim:** over every ordered field $F$, a function
$\varphi : [a,b]_F \to F$ that is continuous on the closed interval $[a,b]_F$
([[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]]) is bounded there, attains a maximum
there, and takes every value between $\varphi(a)$ and $\varphi(b)$. In other
words, the extreme value theorem and the intermediate value theorem hold over an
arbitrary ordered field.

The witness is $F = \mathbb{Q}$ and $D = [0,2]_{\mathbb{Q}}$, with three
functions, one for each clause:

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2 - 2}, \qquad g(x) = -\,(x^2-2)^2, \qquad h(x) = x^2 - 2 .$$

All three are continuous on $D$ in the sense above. $f$ is unbounded; $g$ is
bounded and has no maximum; $h$ satisfies $h(0) = -2 < 0 < 2 = h(2)$ and never
takes the value $0$. What $\mathbb{Q}$ lacks is the least-upper-bound property
(LUB) of [[def-completeness-properties]], and each of the three clauses fails
because of that single omission.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The ordered field $\mathbb{Q}$; the set $D := [0,2]_{\mathbb{Q}} = \{x \in \mathbb{Q} : 0 \le x \le 2\}$; the functions $f, g, h$ above; and the map $T(x) := (2x+2)(x+2)^{-1}$.

[L1] $\mathbb{Q}$ is an ordered field ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]], [[def-rationals]], [[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) and is Archimedean ([[lem-rat-archimedean]]).

[L2] No rational squares to $2$ ([[fs-sqrt2-rational]]).

[L3] In a complete ordered field every element $\ge 0$ has a square root ([[thm-of-square-roots]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L4] Closed intervals $[a,b]_F$ of an ordered field ([[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]]); the properties (LUB) and the rest ([[def-completeness-properties]]).

[L5] Absolute value: $|uv| = |u||v|$, $|u| \ge 0$, $|u| = u$ for $u \ge 0$, and $|u| < c$ exactly when $-c < u < c$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]); $|u+v| \le |u|+|v|$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L6] Powers: $a^0 = 1$, $a^{n+1} = a^n a$ ([[def-integer-power]]); for $0 \le a < b$ and $n \ge 1$, $a^n < b^n$ ([[lem-power-monotone]]); $(1+x)^n \ge 1 + nx$ for $x \ge -1$ ([[lem-bernoulli-inequality]]).

[L7] Recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) and induction principle ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L8] Order arithmetic: a positive element is invertible with positive inverse and reciprocation reverses the order ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]); for $c > 0$, $a < b$ if and only if $ac < bc$ ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]); adding a constant preserves the order and inequalities add ([[lem-of-add-order]]); canonical naturals are positive ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]); the order is total and transitive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For every $x \in D$ one has $x^2 \ne 2$, so $x^2 - 2 \ne 0$ and $|x^2-2| > 0$; and $0 \le x \le 2$ gives $0 \le x^2 \le 4$, so $|x^2 - 2| \le 2$. Hence $f$, $g$ and $h$ are defined on all of $D$. [L2, L5, L6, L8]

1.2 $\mathbb{Q}$ is an ordered field that is not complete: a complete ordered field has a square root of $2$, and no rational squares to $2$. [L1, L2, L3, L4]

1.3 For $x \in D$ one has $x + 2 \ge 2 > 0$, so $T(x) = 2 - 2(x+2)^{-1}$ is defined, and $(x+2)^{-1}$ lies between $(4)^{-1}$ and $(2)^{-1}$, so $1 \le T(x) \le 3/2$ and $T(x) \in D$; moreover $T(x)^2 - 2 = 2(x^2-2)(x+2)^{-2}$ and $(x+2)^2 \ge 4$, so $|T(x)^2 - 2| \le |x^2-2|\,(2)^{-1}$. [L5, L6, L8]

1.4 For all $x, c \in D$: $|x^2 - c^2| = |x-c|\,|x+c| \le 4\,|x-c|$, since $0 \le x + c \le 4$. [L5, L8]

2.1 $h$ is continuous on $D$: given $\varepsilon > 0$ take $\delta := \varepsilon\,(4)^{-1}$, and $|x - c| < \delta$ gives $|h(x)-h(c)| = |x^2-c^2| \le 4|x-c| < \varepsilon$. [step 1.4, L5, L8]

2.2 $g$ is continuous on $D$: $|g(x)-g(c)| = |x^2-c^2|\cdot|(x^2-2)+(c^2-2)| \le 4|x-c| \cdot 4 = 16|x-c|$, using step 1.1 for the second factor, so $\delta := \varepsilon\,(16)^{-1}$ works. [step 1.1, step 1.4, L5, L8]

2.3 $f$ is continuous on $D$: fix $c \in D$ and put $A := |c^2-2| > 0$; for $x \in D$ with $|x-c| < A\,(8)^{-1}$ one gets $|x^2 - c^2| < A\,(2)^{-1}$ and hence $|x^2-2| \ge A - |x^2-c^2| > A\,(2)^{-1}$, so $|f(x)-f(c)| = |c^2-x^2|\big(|x^2-2|\,|c^2-2|\big)^{-1} < 8|x-c|\,A^{-2}$; taking $\delta$ to be the smaller of $A(8)^{-1}$ and $\varepsilon A^2 (8)^{-1}$ gives $|f(x)-f(c)| < \varepsilon$. [step 1.1, step 1.4, L5, L8]

2.4 By the recursion theorem applied to $D$, the element $1 \in D$ and the map $T$, there is a sequence $(x_n)$ in $D$ with $x_0 = 1$ and $x_{n+1} = T(x_n)$; and by induction $|x_n^2 - 2| \le (2^n)^{-1}$, the base case being $|1 - 2| = 1$ and the step being step 1.3. [step 1.3, L6, L7]

2.5 $g$ is bounded on $D$, with $-4 \le g(x) \le 0$, and has no maximum: for every $c \in D$ the point $T(c)$ lies in $D$ and satisfies $|T(c)^2-2| \le |c^2-2|(2)^{-1} < |c^2-2|$, so $(T(c)^2-2)^2 < (c^2-2)^2$ and $g(T(c)) > g(c)$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, L6, L8]

3.1 $f$ is unbounded on $D$: $|f(x_n)| = |x_n^2-2|^{-1} \ge 2^n$, and given any $M \in \mathbb{Q}$ the Archimedean property supplies $n$ with $M < n \cdot 1$, whence $2^n \ge 1 + n \cdot 1 > M$ by Bernoulli. [step 2.4, L1, L6, L8]

3.2 $h$ is continuous on $D$ with $h(0) = -2$ and $h(2) = 2$, so $0$ lies strictly between $h(0)$ and $h(2)$, and yet $h(x) = 0$ has no solution in $D$, since that would be a rational squaring to $2$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L2]

4.1 Over the ordered field $\mathbb{Q}$, on the closed interval $D = [0,2]_{\mathbb{Q}}$: $f$ is continuous and unbounded, $g$ is continuous and bounded with no maximum, and $h$ is continuous and omits a value strictly between its values at the endpoints. All three clauses of the claim are therefore false, and the field involved is exactly one failing (LUB). [step 1.2, step 2.2, step 2.3, step 2.5, step 3.1, step 3.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **One mechanism, three failures.** All three functions are built from $x^2 - 2$, whose zero is missing from $\mathbb{Q}$. The map $T$ is a contraction towards that missing zero: it halves $|x^2-2|$ at every step while staying inside $D$. So $|x^2-2|$ has infimum $0$ on $D$ and does not attain it, and the three failures are three ways of reading that one sentence.

- **Nothing here is peculiar to $\mathbb{Q}$.** The same construction runs in any ordered subfield of $\mathbb{R}$ that omits $\sqrt 2$, since every step above uses only the field operations, the order, and the absence of a square root of $2$. This item exhibits the cheapest witness; no claim is made here about ordered fields in general.

- **This item does not use, and does not need, a general theory of continuous functions.** The $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ condition is stated in the Statement refuted and every use of it above is a direct verification, so the item is self-contained and nothing here waits on a later page. That is deliberate and not a placeholder: the claim refuted here is a claim about an *arbitrary* ordered field, and it is refuted over $\mathbb{Q}$, so a definition of continuity written for real functions on subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ would not apply to it. This library has no notion of continuity over a general ordered field and needs none elsewhere, and inventing an id for one would put an unused definition on a page about completeness properties. The condition above is the ordinary one read inside $F$, and it specialises to the real-variable definition at $F = \mathbb{R}$.

- **What is true over $\mathbb{Q}$.** Continuity, sums and products of continuous functions, and composition all behave normally; what fails is every statement whose proof needs a supremum. That is the content of the page this one belongs to.

## Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq F$.

- $u \in F$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$; $S$ is
  **bounded above** if it has an upper bound.
- $u \in F$ is a **least upper bound** (or **supremum**, $\sup S$) of $S$ if $u$
  is an upper bound of $S$ and $u \le u'$ for every upper bound $u'$ of $S$.

$F$ is a **complete ordered field** (equivalently, $F$ has the
**least-upper-bound property**, or is **Dedekind complete**) if every nonempty
$S \subseteq F$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $F$.

## Remarks

- A least upper bound, if it exists, is unique (two least upper bounds are each
  $\le$ the other, so equal by antisymmetry of the order).
- Applying the property to $\{-s : s \in S\}$ yields the dual **greatest lower
  bound** (infimum) property, so the two are equivalent.
- The Dedekind-cut reals have this property by construction
  ([[thm-dedekind-complete]]); the Cauchy-sequence reals acquire it via
  [[cor-cauchy-reals-lub-complete]]. This definition is the target for the
  uniqueness theorem [[thm-uniqueness-complete-ordered-field]].

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field with its order and
absolute value ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]), and
neighbourhoods are those of [[def-neighbourhood-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Then
$f$ is **continuous at $c$** when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

with $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ ranging over the **positive reals**. In the
language of neighbourhoods: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ with

$$f\bigl(A \cap N_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \;\subseteq\; N_{\varepsilon}\bigl(f(c)\bigr).$$

$f$ is **continuous on $A$** when it is continuous at every point of $A$.

**The point $c$ is required to lie in $A$, and the condition is unpunctured.**
Both differ from [[def-function-limit]], and deliberately. There the quantifier
runs over $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, which removes $x = c$; here $x = c$ is allowed,
and at $x = c$ the implication reads $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$, which is
automatic. So allowing $x = c$ costs nothing, and it is what lets the definition
be stated at every point of $A$, including the points where no limit exists.

**Three clauses, and all three are part of the definition.**

1. **At a limit point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is a limit point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]). Then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if the
   limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) \;=\; f(c)$$
   ([[def-function-limit]]). Indeed, for a given $\varepsilon > 0$ a $\delta$
   witnessing continuity witnesses the limit condition, because the limit
   condition quantifies over a subset of the points continuity quantifies over;
   and conversely a $\delta$ witnessing $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$ witnesses
   continuity, because the one point it omits, $x = c$, satisfies
   $|f(c) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ anyway.

2. **At an isolated point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is an isolated point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so that $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ for some real
   $\eta > 0$. Then **every** $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$: take
   $\delta := \eta$, so that the only $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ is $c$
   itself, and $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$.

3. **On a set.** Continuity on $A$ is continuity at each point of $A$, and
   nothing more. It is not a condition relating $f$ to points outside $A$.

Every point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$,
and never both ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so clauses 1 and 2 between them describe
continuity at every point of $A$.

**This is not the raw $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula of
[[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]].** That item records what goes
wrong when the *punctured* formula of [[def-function-limit]] is written down at
an arbitrary point of the domain: at an isolated point it is satisfied
vacuously by every real $L$ at once, so it defines nothing, and this library
therefore leaves $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ **undefined** at an isolated point.
Continuity at an isolated point is a different matter: the formula above is not
vacuous — it is a genuine condition on $f(c)$, satisfied because $f(c)$ is the
only value being compared with itself — and it names a single, well-defined
property. The limit is undefined there; the continuity is defined, and is
automatic. Clause 1 is the only place where the two notions meet, and it is
stated only where the limit exists as a notion.

**Where the distinction disappears.** If $A$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), then every $c \in A$ has some
$N_{\eta}(c) \subseteq A$, and a punctured neighbourhood is never empty
([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), so every point of $A$ is a limit point of $A$ and
clause 1 covers the whole of $A$. The same holds when $A$ is a nondegenerate
interval ([[def-interval]]). Isolated points are what force clause 2 to exist at
all, and they occur as soon as $A$ is allowed to be an arbitrary subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, as in $A = \{0\} \cup [1,2]$.

## Remarks

- **Continuity is local.** If $\eta > 0$ and $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agrees with
  $f$ on $A \cap N_{\eta}(c)$, then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if $g$
  is: any $\delta$ may be replaced by $\min\{\delta, \eta\}$, after which the
  condition only ever evaluates the two functions where they agree. So
  continuity at $c$ sees only an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of $c$, exactly
  as the limit does ([[lem-limit-is-local]]).

- **Continuity passes to subsets of the domain.** If $B \subseteq A$ and
  $c \in B$, then continuity of $f$ at $c$ gives continuity of the restriction
  $f|_B$ at $c$, with the same $\delta$: the condition on $f|_B$ quantifies over
  fewer points. The converse fails, and the standard witness is the indicator of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ restricted to $\mathbb{Q}$, which is constant and hence
  continuous, while the indicator itself is continuous nowhere
  ([[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]]).

- **The radius is a real number.** As in [[def-neighbourhood-r]], $\varepsilon$
  and $\delta$ range over the positive reals here. Restricting either quantifier
  to the positive rationals defines the same relation, by the passage recorded
  in [[def-function-limit]]: below every positive real lies a positive rational
  ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and a real $\delta$ may be shrunk to a rational
  one below it.

- **The word *continuous* is used for two things in this library, and they
  agree.** [[def-metric-continuity]] defines continuity of a map between metric
  spaces, and $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ carries the metric $d(x,y) = |x-y|$. The
  two notions coincide, and that is proved, not assumed:
  [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]] is the dictionary, and it is stated on
  this page precisely so that no later item has to guess.

## Definition

Let $a \in \mathbb{R}$, where $\mathbb{R}$ is the ambient ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]).

**Natural exponents.** By the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) applied to
the set $\mathbb{R}$, the starting element $1$ and the function
$f(x) = x \cdot a$, there is a unique function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$,
written $n \mapsto a^n$, with

$$a^0 = 1, \qquad a^{n+1} = a^n \cdot a \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Thus $a^1 = a$, $a^2 = a \cdot a$, and so on. Note that this is defined for
**every** $a$, including $a = 0$.

**Negative exponents.** If $a \ne 0$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, set

$$a^{-n} := (a^n)^{-1}.$$

**Why that is legitimate.** The right-hand side presupposes that $a^n$ is
invertible, that is, that $a^n \ne 0$. This is a proof obligation and not an
observation, and it is discharged by claim 2 of [[lem-power-laws]]: for $a \ne 0$
in a field, $a^n \ne 0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, proved there by induction on
$n$ from the fact that a field has no zero divisors ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]).
That lemma is a statement *about* the operation introduced here, so it depends on
this definition and is recorded in this item's `justified_by` rather than in its
`deps` (SCHEMA §3). Given $a^n \ne 0$, the value $(a^n)^{-1}$ is a single
well-determined element, because multiplicative inverses in a field are unique
([[lem-of-inverse-unique]]).

**Integer exponents.** Every integer $m$ ([[def-integers]]) is either
$\iota(n)$ or $-\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$, where $\iota$ is the
embedding $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]],
[[def-int-operations]]). This too is a citation and not a slogan: the order on
$\mathbb{Z}$ is total ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), so $m \ge 0$ or $m < 0$; the
image of $\iota$ is exactly the set of nonnegative integers, and each of them is
$\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]); and if $m < 0$ then
$-m > 0$, by compatibility of the order with addition ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]),
so $-m = \iota(n)$ and $m = -\iota(n)$, with $n$ unique because $\iota$ is
injective. The two clauses above therefore define $a^m$ for every
$m \in \mathbb{Z}$ whenever $a \ne 0$, and for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$ for
arbitrary $a$. The clauses are consistent where they overlap: the only overlap is
$m = 0$, where $-\iota(0) = \iota(0)$ and $(a^0)^{-1} = 1^{-1} = 1 = a^0$.

## Remarks

- **The convention $0^0 = 1$ is adopted here**, and it is not a matter of taste
  but of agreement with the recursion above: $a^0 = 1$ is the starting value for
  every $a$, exactly as the empty product is $1$ ([[def-finite-sum]]). This is
  the convention that makes the empty product, the binomial theorem, and
  polynomial notation $\sum_k c_k x^k$ work at $x = 0$ without an exception. The
  competing convention "$0^0$ undefined" belongs to contexts where $x^y$ is
  studied as a function of two *real* variables and one wants continuity, which
  is unavailable and irrelevant here: the exponent in $a^m$ is an integer, never
  a real.
- $0^n = 0$ for every $n \ge 1$, since $0^{n} = 0^{n-1} \cdot 0 = 0$, a product
  with a zero factor ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]); and
  $0^{-n}$ is not defined for $n \ge 1$, since $0$ has no inverse.
- The exponent is an integer and stays an integer. Rational exponents are a
  separate construction resting on the existence of roots
  ([[thm-nth-roots-exist]], [[def-rational-power]]), and real exponents do not
  exist in this library yet ([[rem-real-exponents-deferred]]).
- The laws $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$ are
  proved, not assumed, in [[lem-power-laws]]; the order behaviour of $a \mapsto a^n$
  is [[lem-power-monotone]].

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ ([[def-field]]) together with a subset
$P \subseteq F$, the set of **positive** elements (the *positive cone*),
satisfying:

- **(O1) Trichotomy.** For each $x \in F$, exactly one of the following holds:
  $x \in P$, or $x = 0$, or $-x \in P$.
- **(O2) Closure.** If $x, y \in P$ then $x + y \in P$ and $x \cdot y \in P$.

We write $x > 0$ for $x \in P$ (read "$x$ is positive"), and define the order by

$$a < b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; b - a \in P, \qquad a \le b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; a < b \text{ or } a = b.$$

Thus $a > b$ means $b < a$, and $a \ge b$ means $b \le a$. An element $x$ with
$-x \in P$ (equivalently $x < 0$) is called **negative**.

## Remarks

- By trichotomy applied to $b - a$, for any $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$,
  $a = b$, $a > b$ holds; this makes $\le$ a total order.
- (O2) says the positives are closed under addition and multiplication: sums and
  products of positives are positive.
- The rationals ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and both constructions of the reals
  ([[thm-reals-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-dedekind-ordered-field]]) are ordered
  fields, so every fact proved here from (O1)-(O2) holds in each of them.

## Definition

A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals **converges** to $x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for
every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with
$|x_k - x| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$. It is **Cauchy** when for

$|x_k - x_l| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$.

## Remarks

- Quantifying over rational $\varepsilon$ loses nothing: below any real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ lies a positive rational ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).
- $|\cdot|$ is the absolute value of [[def-real-order]].

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]],
[[def-real-numbers]]) with its order and absolute value ([[def-real-order]]), and
$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers with its order ([[def-natural-numbers]],
[[def-nat-order]]).

A **sequence of reals** is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$. We write
$x_k$ for the value $x(k)$, call it the **$k$-th term**, and write $(x_k)$, or
$(x_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$, for the function itself. The **range** of $(x_k)$ is
the subset $\{\, x_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals and let $P$ be a property of indices.

- $(x_k)$ is **bounded** if there is $M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for
  every $k \in \mathbb{N}$; it is **unbounded** otherwise.
- $P$ holds **eventually** if there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $P(k)$ holds
  for every $k \ge K$.
- $P$ holds **frequently** if for every $K \in \mathbb{N}$ there is some
  $k \ge K$ for which $P(k)$ holds.
- For $K \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$K$-th tail** of $(x_k)$ is the sequence
  $x^{(K)}$ defined by $x^{(K)}_j := x_{j + K}$ for $j \in \mathbb{N}$; it is
  again a sequence of reals.
- A function $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is **strictly increasing** if
  $n_j < n_k$ whenever $j < k$. For such an $n$, the **subsequence** of $(x_k)$
  along $n$ is the composite $x \circ n$, written $(x_{n_k})_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$;
  it is again a sequence of reals.

**Convergence and Cauchyness are not defined here.** They are already fixed, for
sequences of reals, by the published [[def-real-limit]]: $(x_k)$ *converges* to
$x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is
$K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$, and $(x_k)$
is *Cauchy* when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$
with $|x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$. This page builds the
toolkit for those two notions and does not restate them. A sequence
**converges** if it converges to some real, and **diverges** if it does not.

## Remarks

- **Identification of $\mathbb{Q}$ with its image.** The map $q \mapsto \hat q$
  is an embedding of ordered fields ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and as is
  standard we write $q$ for $\hat q$, so that a rational may be compared with a
  real without further comment. [[def-real-limit]] is stated with the hat; every
  rational $\varepsilon$ occurring on this page is its image under this
  embedding.

- **Rational and real $\varepsilon$ agree.** [[def-real-limit]] tests convergence
  against every *rational* $\varepsilon > 0$, and its own remark records that
  this loses nothing. Spelled out: suppose that for every rational
  $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all
  $k \ge K$, and let $\eta > 0$ be an arbitrary *real*. Since $0 < \eta$,
  density of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) supplies a
  rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, and the index $K$
  belonging to that $\varepsilon$ satisfies $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon < \eta$ for
  all $k \ge K$. The converse implication is immediate, since every positive
  rational is a positive real. So the two formulations define the same relation,
  and the same two lines apply verbatim to the Cauchy condition and to any
  condition of the shape "for every $\varepsilon > 0$, eventually
  $\cdots < \varepsilon$". Proofs on this page therefore run the test with a real
  $\varepsilon$ wherever that is more convenient, and say so by citing this
  remark; nothing is smuggled in.

- **Constant sequences converge.** For $c \in \mathbb{R}$ the constant sequence
  $x_k := c$ converges to $c$, because $|x_k - c| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ for
  every $\varepsilon > 0$ and every $k$; it is bounded by $|c|$.

- **Eventually and frequently are dual.** $P$ holds frequently exactly when
  $\lnot P$ does not hold eventually, and $P$ holds eventually exactly when
  $\lnot P$ does not hold frequently. So the two quantifier patterns are
  negations of one another applied to the complementary property, and there is no
  third pattern hiding between them.

- **A sequence is not its range.** $(x_k)$ is a function, not a set, and the
  range does not determine the function: the sequence $x_0 = 0$, $x_k = 1$ for
  $k \ge 1$ and the sequence $y_0 = y_1 = 0$, $y_k = 1$ for $k \ge 2$ have the
  same range $\{0, 1\}$, yet they differ at $k = 1$, so they are different
  sequences. Order and repetition are part of the data and the range forgets
  both. Boundedness, on the other hand, depends only on the range.

- **Indexing.** Sequences here start at $k = 0$ because $\mathbb{N}$ contains
  $0$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]). Texts that index from $1$ describe the same
  objects up to a shift, and the shift changes nothing about convergence, by
  [[lem-limit-of-tail]].

## Statement

Let $r \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $r^k$ be the integer power ([[def-integer-power]]).

1. If $|r| < 1$ then $(r^k)$ is **null**, that is $r^k \to 0$
   ([[def-real-limit]]).
2. If $|r| > 1$ then $(|r|^k)$ **diverges to $+\infty$**
   ([[def-divergence-to-infinity]]).

Claim 2 is stated for $|r|^k$ and not for $r^k$ on purpose: for $r < -1$ the
terms $r^k$ alternate in sign and are unbounded, so they neither converge nor
diverge to $+\infty$; what is true of them is the statement about their absolute
values.

Both claims come from Bernoulli's inequality ([[lem-bernoulli-inequality]]) and
the Archimedean property. Nothing here needs the least-upper-bound property
except through [[thm-of-archimedean]] and [[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A real $r$, with integer powers as in [[def-integer-power]]; for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the symbol $n$ also denotes the canonical natural $n \cdot 1_{\mathbb{R}}$ where it occurs in an arithmetic expression.

[L1] Absolute value: $|x| \ge 0$; $|x| = 0$ exactly when $x = 0$; $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; and $|x| = x$ when $x \ge 0$, so in particular $|1| = 1$ because $1 > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]], [[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] Induction principle ([[thm-induction-principle]]), and the recursion clauses $a^0 = 1$, $a^{k+1} = a^k a$ defining integer powers ([[def-integer-power]]).

[L3] Bernoulli's inequality: $(1+x)^n \ge 1 + nx$ for $x \ge -1$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[lem-bernoulli-inequality]]).

[L4] Power laws: $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$, and $a^n \ne 0$ when $a \ne 0$ ([[lem-power-laws]]).

[L5] Powers and order: $a \ge 0$ gives $a^n \ge 0$ and $a > 0$ gives $a^n > 0$; $1^n = 1$ for every $n$ ([[lem-power-monotone]]).

[L6] Reciprocals: $a > 0$ gives $a^{-1} > 0$; $0 < a < b$ gives $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]); and $0 < t < 1$ exactly when $1/t > 1$ ([[prop-of-reciprocal-order]]).

[L7] Archimedean property: for every $x \in \mathbb{R}$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $x < n$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); and for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/N < \varepsilon$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]]).

[L8] Canonical naturals: $n > 0$ for $n \ge 1$, and $m \le n$ in $\mathbb{N}$ gives $m \le n$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L9] Multiplying inequalities of nonnegatives: $0 \le a \le b$ and $0 \le c \le d$ give $ac \le bd$ ([[prop-of-multiply-inequalities]]).

[L10] Trichotomy of the order on $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L11] Convergence to $0$ and divergence to $+\infty$ for a sequence of reals; a rational test value $\varepsilon > 0$ is in particular a real one ([[def-real-limit]], [[def-divergence-to-infinity]], [[def-sequence]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 First, $|r^k| = |r|^k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, by induction: at $k = 0$ both sides are $|1| = 1$, and if $|r^k| = |r|^k$ then $|r^{k+1}| = |r^k r| = |r^k|\,|r| = |r|^k |r| = |r|^{k+1}$. [given, L1, L2]

1.2 **Case zero.** Assume $r = 0$. [given, assume-case zero]

1.3 **Case small.** Assume $0 < |r| < 1$. [given, assume-case small]

1.4 **Case large.** Assume $|r| > 1$. [given, assume-case large]

2.1 In case zero, $r^k = 0$ for every $k \ge 1$: indeed $r^1 = r^0 r = 1 \cdot 0 = 0$, and if $r^k = 0$ then $r^{k+1} = r^k r = 0$, so induction gives the claim from $k = 1$ on. [step 1.2, L2]

2.2 In case small, put $s := 1/|r|$, which is defined since $|r| \ne 0$, and $h := s - 1$. Then $s > 1$ and $h > 0$. [step 1.3, L1, L6, choose]

2.3 In case large, put $h' := |r| - 1$, so $h' > 0$ and $|r| = 1 + h'$. [step 1.4, choose]

3.1 In case zero, for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ and every $k \ge 1$ we have $|r^k - 0| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$, so $r^k \to 0$ and claim 1 holds. [step 2.1, L1, L11]

3.2 In case small, $|r|^k s^k = (|r| s)^k = 1^k = 1$, so $|r|^k = 1/s^k$, and $s^k > 0$. [step 2.2, L4, L5]

3.3 In case small, Bernoulli applied to $h > 0 \ge -1$ gives $s^k = (1+h)^k \ge 1 + kh > kh > 0$ for every $k \ge 1$, using $1 > 0$ and $kh > 0$. [step 2.2, L3, L8, L9]

3.4 In case large, Bernoulli applied to $h' > 0 \ge -1$ gives $|r|^k = (1 + h')^k \ge 1 + k h'$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 2.3, L3]

3.5 In case large, let $M \in \mathbb{R}$ be arbitrary and use [L7] to fix a natural $n \ge 1$ with $M/h' < n$; then $M \le n h'$, since multiplying $M/h' \le n$ by $h' > 0$ preserves the inequality. [step 2.3, L7, L9, choose]

3.6 In case small, let $\varepsilon > 0$ be rational; then $\varepsilon h > 0$, so [L7] supplies a natural $N \ge 1$ with $1/N < \varepsilon h$, whence $1/(Nh) \le \varepsilon$ on multiplying by $1/h > 0$. [step 2.2, L6, L7, L9, choose]

4.1 In case small, combining steps 3.2 and 3.3: $0 < kh < s^k$ gives $|r|^k = 1/s^k < 1/(kh)$ for every $k \ge 1$. [step 3.2, step 3.3, L6]

4.2 In case large, for every $k \ge n$ we have $k h' \ge n h' \ge M$, so $|r|^k \ge 1 + k h' \ge 1 + M > M$, the last step because $1 > 0$. [step 3.4, step 3.5, L1, L8, L9]

5.1 In case small, for every $k \ge N$ we have $kh \ge Nh > 0$, hence $1/(kh) \le 1/(Nh) \le \varepsilon$, and therefore $|r^k - 0| = |r^k| = |r|^k < 1/(kh) \le \varepsilon$. [step 1.1, step 4.1, step 3.6, L6, L8, L9]

5.2 In case large, an index $n$ has been produced for an arbitrary real $M$ with $|r|^k > M$ for all $k \ge n$, which is exactly divergence to $+\infty$: claim 2 holds. [step 4.2, L11]

6.1 In case small, the rational $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary and the index $N$ was produced from it, so $r^k \to 0$ and claim 1 holds. [step 5.1, L11]

7.1 The hypothesis $|r| < 1$ of claim 1 is exhausted by cases zero and small, since $|r| \ge 0$ with $|r| = 0$ exactly when $r = 0$, so trichotomy leaves only $0 < |r| < 1$; the hypothesis $|r| > 1$ of claim 2 is case large. Both claims are therefore established. [step 3.1, step 5.2, step 6.1, L1, L10, cases: zero small or large, cases-exhaustive] ∎

## Remarks

- **The two claims are not one claim in disguise.** For $|r| > 1$ the sequence
  $(r^k)$ itself has no limiting behaviour to record when $r$ is negative: its
  terms alternate in sign and grow, so it neither converges nor diverges to
  $+\infty$ nor to $-\infty$. Stating claim 2 for $|r|^k$ is what makes it true
  as written.

- **The boundary $|r| = 1$ is excluded and is genuinely different.** For $r = 1$
  the sequence is constant $1$; for $r = -1$ it is the alternating sequence
  ([[lem-alternating-sequence]]), which is bounded and divergent
  ([[fs-bounded-implies-convergent]]). So neither claim extends to $|r| = 1$, and
  the two cases at the boundary do not even agree with each other.

- **Where this is used.** Claim 1 supplies the null sequence $c^{k}$ that makes a
  contractive sequence Cauchy ([[thm-contractive-implies-cauchy]]) and the null
  sequence $(1/10)^n$ that identifies the limit of the decimal truncations of
  $\sqrt 2$ ([[cex-cauchy-rationals-no-rational-limit]]).

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ be sequences of reals ([[def-sequence]]) converging to
$x$ and $y$ respectively ([[def-real-limit]]). If $x_k \le y_k$ eventually, that
is for all $k$ from some index on, then

$$\lim_{k} x_k \;\le\; \lim_{k} y_k .$$

In particular, if $x_k \ge 0$ eventually then $\lim_k x_k \ge 0$, and if
$a \le x_k \le b$ eventually then $a \le \lim_k x_k \le b$.

The conclusion is **not** strict, and cannot be made strict; see the remarks
below and the false statement at the end of this page.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $(x_k)$, $(y_k)$ of reals with $(x_k)$ converging to $x$, $(y_k)$ converging to $y$, and an index $K_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ with $x_k \le y_k$ for every $k \ge K_0$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]). Write $z_k := y_k - x_k$ and $z := y - x$.

[L1] Convergence, quantified over rational $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-real-limit]]).

[L2] Difference rule: $(z_k) = (y_k - x_k)$ converges to $y - x = z$ ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]]).

[L3] Small rationals: for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, by density ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) or by the Archimedean property ([[thm-of-archimedean]]) applied to $1/\eta$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

[L4] Absolute value: $|u| < c$ if and only if $-c < u < c$, for $c > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L5] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: adding a constant preserves $<$ and $\le$; $u \le v$ and $v < w$ give $u < w$; trichotomy, so exactly one of $z < 0$, $z = 0$, $z > 0$ holds and the negation of $z < 0$ is $z \ge 0$; $u \le v$ if and only if $v - u \ge 0$; and $u < u$ is impossible ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L6] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total, so any two indices admit a common upper bound ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

[L7] For $c \in \mathbb{R}$ the constant sequence $(c)$ converges to $c$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L8] A sequence of reals has at most one limit ([[lem-limit-unique]]), which is what licenses writing $\lim_k x_k$ and $\lim_k y_k$ for the limits named in the statement; without it those symbols would not denote.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 By [L2] the sequence $(z_k)$ converges to $z = y - x$, and by hypothesis $z_k = y_k - x_k \ge 0$ for every $k \ge K_0$. [given, L2, L5]

1.2 Suppose, for contradiction, that $z < 0$. [assume-contra]

2.1 Then $-z > 0$, so by [L3] we may choose a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < -z$. [step 1.2, L3, L5, choose]

3.1 Applying convergence of $(z_k)$ to this $\varepsilon$ gives $K_1 \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|z_k - z| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K_1$, hence $z_k - z < \varepsilon$ and so $z_k < z + \varepsilon$ for all such $k$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L1, L4, L5]

4.1 Fix an index $k$ with $k \ge K_0$ and $k \ge K_1$. Then $0 \le z_k < z + \varepsilon < z + (-z) = 0$, so $0 < 0$, which is impossible. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 3.1, L5, L6]

5.1 The assumption $z < 0$ is therefore untenable; by trichotomy $z \ge 0$, that is $y - x \ge 0$, that is $x \le y$; since $x$ and $y$ are the unique limits of $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ by [L8], that is exactly $\lim_k x_k \le \lim_k y_k$. Since $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ were an arbitrary pair satisfying the hypotheses, the conclusion applies to every such pair, and the two stated special cases are instances of it. Let $(w_k)$ be convergent. If $w_k \ge 0$ from some index on, apply the conclusion to the pair consisting of the constant sequence $0$, which converges to $0$ by [L7], and of $(w_k)$: it gives $0 \le \lim_k w_k$. If $a \le w_k \le b$ from some index on, apply it first to the constant sequence $a$ and $(w_k)$, then to $(w_k)$ and the constant sequence $b$: it gives $a \le \lim_k w_k$ and $\lim_k w_k \le b$. [step 4.1, L5, L7, L8, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- The two special cases are instances of the main claim, discharged in step 5.1 by taking one of the two sequences constant; that a constant sequence converges to its value ([[def-sequence]]) is the only extra ingredient they need.

- **The inequality does not become strict.** From $x_k < y_k$ for every $k$ one may conclude only $\lim x_k \le \lim y_k$; the witness $x_k = 0 < 1/(k+1) = y_k$ has equal limits ([[fs-limit-preserves-strict-inequality]]). Intuitively, the order relation $<$ is not preserved by passage to a limit because a strict gap may shrink to nothing, while $\le$ is preserved because it is closed under that shrinking.

- The proof routes through the single sequence $(z_k) = (y_k - x_k)$ and the difference rule of [[thm-algebra-of-limits]]. That is not an economy of writing only: it isolates the one thing being proved, namely that a sequence eventually $\ge 0$ cannot have a negative limit.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$, with
$|x|$ the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]). Then

$$|x| \ge 0; \quad |x| = 0 \iff x = 0; \quad -|x| \le x \le |x|; \quad |-x| = |x|; \quad |xy| = |x|\,|y|;$$

and, for every $c > 0$, one has $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and elements $x, y \in F$.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| = u$ if $u \ge 0$, and $|u| = -u$ if $u < 0$ ([[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Ordered-field order: trichotomy holds (for each $u$ exactly one of $u > 0$, $u = 0$, $u < 0$), $a < b$ means $b - a$ is positive, and sums and products of positives are positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Signs in products: $(-a)b = -(ab)$ and $(-a)(-b) = ab$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] Sign rules: a product of two elements of the same sign is positive, and a product of two elements of opposite sign is negative ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Case $x > 0$: by [L1] $|x| = x > 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; since $-x < 0$ we get $|-x| = -(-x) = x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -x < 0 < x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case pos, L1, L2, algebra]

1.2 Case $x = 0$: then $|x| = |0| = 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ holds with $|x| = 0$ and $x = 0$, while $|-x| = |0| = |x|$ and $-|x| = 0 \le 0 \le 0 = |x|$. [assume-case zero, L1]

1.3 Case $x < 0$: by [L1] $|x| = -x$, and [L2] gives $-x > 0$, so $|x| > 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; here $|-x| = -x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -(-x) = x \le x$ while $x < 0 < -x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case neg, L1, L2, algebra]

1.4 Case $x = 0$ or $y = 0$: then $xy = 0$, so $|xy| = 0$, and one of $|x|, |y|$ is $0$, whence $|x|\,|y| = 0 = |xy|$. [assume-case zerofactor, L1]

1.5 Case $x, y$ have the same sign (both positive or both negative): by [L4] $xy > 0$, so $|xy| = xy$, while $|x|\,|y| = xy$ by [L3] (for $x, y < 0$ this is $(-x)(-y) = xy$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case same, L1, L3, L4]

1.6 Case $x, y$ have opposite signs (one positive, one negative): by [L4] $xy < 0$, so $|xy| = -(xy)$, while $|x|\,|y| = -(xy)$ by [L3] (namely $x(-y)$ or $(-x)y$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case opposite, L1, L3, L4]

2.1 By trichotomy [L2] each $x$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.1-1.3, and in each we verified $|x| \ge 0$, that $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$, that $|-x| = |x|$, and that $-|x| \le x \le |x|$; hence all four hold for every $x$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, cases-exhaustive]

2.2 By trichotomy [L2] each pair $x, y$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.4-1.6, and in each $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$ for all $x, y$. [step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6, cases-exhaustive]

3.1 Let $c > 0$: if $|x| < c$ then $-c < -|x| \le x \le |x| < c$ by [step 2.1] and [L2], so $-c < x < c$; conversely if $-c < x < c$ then both $x < c$ and $-x < c$, and since $|x|$ equals $x$ or $-x$ by [L1], we get $|x| < c$, so $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$. [step 2.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Statement

Let $a, b$ be elements of a field ([[def-field]]) and let integer powers be as in
[[def-integer-power]].

1. For all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$: $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$.
2. If $a \ne 0$ then $a^n \ne 0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and $a^{-m} = (a^m)^{-1}$ for every $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ ([[def-int-operations]]).
3. If $a \ne 0$ and $b \ne 0$ then all three identities of claim 1 hold for all $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Elements $a, b$ of a field $F$, naturals $m, n, p, q, k$ and integers ranged over by $m, n$ in claims 2 and 3.

[L1] Definition of powers ([[def-integer-power]]): $a^0 = 1$ and $a^{n+1} = a^n a$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$; and $a^{-n} := (a^n)^{-1}$ for $a \ne 0$ and $n \ge 1$, the two clauses agreeing at $n = 0$.

[L2] Induction principle ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L3] Field arithmetic: multiplication is associative and commutative with identity $1$, and every nonzero element has an inverse ([[def-field]]); inverses are unique ([[lem-of-inverse-unique]], which states uniqueness and nothing further), and HENCE, for $x, y \ne 0$, $(xy)^{-1} = x^{-1} y^{-1}$ and $(x^{-1})^{-1} = x$, since $(xy)(x^{-1}y^{-1}) = 1$ and $x^{-1}x = 1$ exhibit inverses that uniqueness then identifies.

[L4] A field has no zero divisors: $xy = 0$ implies $x = 0$ or $y = 0$ ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]).

[L5] $\mathbb{Z}$ is a commutative ring in which every element is $\iota(k)$ or $-\iota(k)$ for a unique natural $k$ ([[thm-int-comm-ring]], [[lem-nat-embeds-int]], [[def-int-operations]]); we write $k$ for $\iota(k)$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base cases at $n = 0$ for the addition law, the product law and nonvanishing: $a^{m+0} = a^m = a^m \cdot 1 = a^m a^0$ for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$; $(ab)^0 = 1 = 1 \cdot 1 = a^0 b^0$; and if $a \ne 0$ then $a^0 = 1 \ne 0$. [base, L1, L3]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$ for all $m \in \mathbb{N}$, $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$, and $a^n \ne 0$ whenever $a \ne 0$. The iterated-power law $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ is deliberately NOT carried in this hypothesis: its successor step needs the addition law at the exponent pair $(mn, m)$, whose second entry is not the current stage, so that law must be finished first and the iterated law proved afterwards. [ih]

1.3 For $a \ne 0$ and every integer $j$, $a^{-j} = (a^j)^{-1}$: for $j \ge 0$ this is the definition together with the agreement of the two clauses at $j = 0$, and for $j = -k$ with $k \ge 1$ it reads $a^{k} = (a^{-k})^{-1}$, which holds because $a^{-k} = (a^k)^{-1}$ and $(x^{-1})^{-1} = x$ at $x = a^{k}$. That last substitution needs $a^{k} \ne 0$, which is NOT free here and must not be read off the definition, since the definition of the negative clause is what is being justified; it is instead a self-contained induction on $k$, from $a^{0} = 1 \ne 0$ and the fact that $a^{k+1} = a^{k}a$ is a product of two nonzero elements of a field, hence nonzero. [L1, L2, L3, L4, L5]

2.1 Successor step for the addition law, the product law and nonvanishing: $a^{m+(n+1)} = a^{(m+n)+1} = a^{m+n} a = (a^m a^n) a = a^m (a^n a) = a^m a^{n+1}$ for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$; $(ab)^{n+1} = (ab)^n (ab) = (a^n b^n)(ab) = (a^n a)(b^n b) = a^{n+1} b^{n+1}$; and if $a \ne 0$ then $a^{n+1} = a^n a$ is a product of two nonzero elements, hence nonzero. [step 1.2, L1, L3, L4]

3.1 By the induction principle, for all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$: $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$, and $a^n \ne 0$ whenever $a \ne 0$. The addition law is thereby available at EVERY pair of natural exponents, which is exactly what the iterated-power law needs. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L2]

4.1 The iterated-power law for natural exponents, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$, by a second induction on $n$ with $m \in \mathbb{N}$ fixed: at $n = 0$ both sides are $1$, since $(a^m)^0 = 1 = a^0 = a^{m \cdot 0}$; and if $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ then $(a^m)^{n+1} = (a^m)^n a^m = a^{mn} a^m = a^{mn+m} = a^{m(n+1)}$, where the third equality is the addition law of step 3.1 at the pair $(mn, m)$, legitimate precisely because that law is by now proved for all pairs of naturals. This completes claim 1. [step 3.1, L1, L2, L3]

4.2 For $a \ne 0$ and every integer $j$, $a^{j+1} = a^j a$: for $j \ge 0$ this is the recursion clause, and for $j = -k$ with $k \ge 1$ we compute $a^{-k} a = (a^k)^{-1} a = (a^{k-1} a)^{-1} a = (a^{k-1})^{-1} a^{-1} a = (a^{k-1})^{-1} = a^{-(k-1)} = a^{-k+1}$. [step 3.1, step 1.3, L1, L3]

4.3 For $a, b \ne 0$ the product law holds for all integers $n$: for $n \ge 0$ it is step 3.1, and for $n = -k$ with $k \ge 1$ we get $(ab)^{-k} = ((ab)^k)^{-1} = (a^k b^k)^{-1} = (a^k)^{-1}(b^k)^{-1} = a^{-k} b^{-k}$. [step 3.1, step 1.3, L3, L5]

5.1 For $a \ne 0$, every integer $j$ and every natural $k$, $a^{j+k} = a^j a^k$, by induction on $k$: the case $k = 0$ is $a^j = a^j \cdot 1$, and if $a^{j+k} = a^j a^k$ then $a^{j+k+1} = a^{j+k} a = a^j a^k a = a^j a^{k+1}$ by step 4.2 applied to the integer $j+k$ and by the recursion clause. [step 4.2, L1, L2, L3]

6.1 For $a \ne 0$ the addition law holds for all integers $m, n$: writing $n = k$ or $n = -k$ with $k \in \mathbb{N}$, the case $n = k$ is step 5.1, while for $n = -k$ step 5.1 applied to the integer $m - k$ gives $a^m = a^{(m-k)+k} = a^{m-k} a^k$, hence $a^{m-k} = a^m (a^k)^{-1} = a^m a^{-k}$. [step 5.1, step 1.3, L3, L5]

7.1 For $a \ne 0$ the iterated-power law holds for all integers $m, n$: for $n \ge 0$ induction on $n$ gives $(a^m)^{n+1} = (a^m)^n a^m = a^{mn} a^m = a^{mn+m} = a^{m(n+1)}$, the third equality by the integer addition law of step 6.1 at the pair $(mn, m)$, with base $(a^m)^0 = 1 = a^0$; and for $n = -q$ with $q \ge 1$, $(a^m)^{-q} = ((a^m)^q)^{-1} = (a^{mq})^{-1} = a^{-mq} = a^{m(-q)}$, using that $a^m \ne 0$ by step 3.1 and step 1.3. [step 6.1, step 3.1, step 1.3, L2, L3, L5]

8.1 Claims 1, 2 and 3 are therefore established: the addition, product and iterated-power laws for natural exponents together with nonvanishing by steps 3.1 and 4.1, the identity $a^{-m} = (a^m)^{-1}$ by step 1.3, and the three integer-exponent laws by steps 6.1, 4.3 and 7.1. [step 3.1, step 4.1, step 1.3, step 6.1, step 4.3, step 7.1, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$, let
$\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Suppose $f$ and $g$ are continuous at
$c$ ([[def-continuity-real]]). Then:

1. $f + g$, $\alpha f$ and $fg$ are continuous at $c$;
2. $|f|$, the function $x \mapsto |f(x)|$, is continuous at $c$;
3. $\max\{f,g\}$ and $\min\{f,g\}$, defined pointwise by
   $x \mapsto \max\{f(x), g(x)\}$ and $x \mapsto \min\{f(x), g(x)\}$
   ([[def-max-min]]), are continuous at $c$;
4. if $g(c) \ne 0$ then, writing $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$, the
   point $c$ lies in $A_0$ and the quotient
   $(f/g)|_{A_0} : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$, $x \mapsto f(x)/g(x)$, is continuous at
   $c$ as a function on $A_0$.

Moreover, with no hypothesis at all:

5. every constant function $A \to \mathbb{R}$ and the identity
   $\mathrm{id} : A \to \mathbb{R}$, $x \mapsto x$, are continuous on $A$; hence
   so is $x \mapsto x^{n}$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$
   ([[def-integer-power]]), and hence so is every **polynomial function**
   $x \mapsto a_0 + a_1 x + \dots + a_n x^{n}$ with real coefficients.

Consequently, if $f$ and $g$ are continuous **on** $A$ then so are $f+g$,
$\alpha f$, $fg$, $|f|$, $\max\{f,g\}$ and $\min\{f,g\}$, and
$(f/g)|_{A_0}$ is continuous on $A_0$.

**Claim 4 is stated on $A_0$ because $f/g$ is not defined where $g$ vanishes**,
and $g$ may well vanish at points of $A$ far from $c$. The hypothesis is
$g(c) \ne 0$, not "$g$ nowhere zero"; what it buys is that $c$ itself lies in
the smaller domain, which is what makes continuity there mean anything.

**Nothing here is proved through a sequence.** Claims 1 and 4 are read off from
[[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]], which is itself proved from $\varepsilon$
and $\delta$, and claims 2, 3 and 5 are proved directly below. So no choice
principle is used anywhere in this item.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, functions $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\alpha$, a point $c \in A$ at which $f$ and $g$ are continuous, and, for claim 4, the hypothesis $g(c) \ne 0$ together with $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$.

[L1] Continuity at $c$: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L2] A point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$, and never both; at an isolated point of its domain every function is continuous; at a limit point $c$ of $A$, continuity of $f$ at $c$ is exactly the statement that the limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and equals $f(c)$ ([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-function-limit]]).

[L3] Algebra of function limits at a limit point $c$ of $A$: if the limits of $f$ and $g$ at $c$ exist with values $L$ and $M$, then the limits of $f+g$, $\alpha f$ and $fg$ at $c$ exist with values $L+M$, $\alpha L$ and $LM$; and if $M \ne 0$ then $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$, and the limit of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$ exists and equals $L/M$ ([[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]]).

[L4] Sign preservation: if the limit of $g$ at a limit point $c$ of $A$ exists and is nonzero, then $c$ is a limit point of $A_0 = \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$ ([[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]]).

[L5] Reverse triangle inequality: $\bigl||u| - |v|\bigr| \le |u - v|$ ([[cor-of-reverse-triangle]]); and $|u| \ge 0$, $|u| = 0$ exactly when $u = 0$, $|uv| = |u||v|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L6] Maximum and minimum of a two-element set of reals exist ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]), and for all reals $u, v$ one has $\max\{u,v\} = \tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(u + v + |u-v|\bigr)$ and $\min\{u,v\} = \tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(u + v - |u-v|\bigr)$.

[L7] Ordered-field arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: trichotomy and totality of the order, the field identities, and $0 < 1$ so that $2 \ne 0$ and $t/2$ is defined ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]).

[L8] Integer powers: $a^{0} = 1$ and $a^{n+1} = a^{n} \cdot a$ ([[def-integer-power]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Justification of the identity in [L6].** Let $u, v \in \mathbb{R}$. By totality either $u \ge v$ or $v \ge u$. If $u \ge v$ then $u - v \ge 0$, so $|u-v| = u-v$ and $\tfrac{1}{2}(u+v+|u-v|) = \tfrac{1}{2}(2u) = u = \max\{u,v\}$, while $\tfrac{1}{2}(u+v-|u-v|) = v = \min\{u,v\}$. If $v \ge u$ the same computation with the roles exchanged applies, since $|u-v| = v-u$ there. [L5, L6, L7]

1.2 **The isolated case.** Suppose $c$ is an isolated point of $A$, say $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ with $\eta > 0$ real. Then every function on $A$ is continuous at $c$ by [L2], which gives claims 1, 2 and 3 at once. For claim 4, assume $g(c) \ne 0$; then $c \in A_0$, and $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A_0 \subseteq N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ with $c$ in the left-hand side, so $c$ is an isolated point of $A_0$ and every function on $A_0$, in particular $(f/g)|_{A_0}$, is continuous at $c$. [L2]

1.3 **Claim 2, at any point of $A$.** Let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given and let $\delta > 0$ be as in [L1] for $f$ and this $\varepsilon$. For $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ the reverse triangle inequality gives $\bigl||f(x)| - |f(c)|\bigr| \le |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$. So $|f|$ is continuous at $c$, and no case distinction was needed. [L1, L5]

1.4 **Claim 5, constants and the identity.** If $f$ is constant then $|f(x) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$ for every $x \in A$ and every real $\varepsilon > 0$, so any $\delta > 0$ serves. For the identity, given a real $\varepsilon > 0$ take $\delta := \varepsilon$: every $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ has $|\mathrm{id}(x) - \mathrm{id}(c)| = |x - c| < \varepsilon$. Both are continuous at every point of $A$. [L1, L5, L7]

1.5 **The limit-point case, claim 1.** Suppose $c$ is a limit point of $A$. By [L2] the limits of $f$ and of $g$ at $c$ exist and equal $f(c)$ and $g(c)$. By [L3] the limits of $f+g$, $\alpha f$ and $fg$ at $c$ exist and equal $f(c)+g(c)$, $\alpha f(c)$ and $f(c)g(c)$, which are exactly the values of those three functions at $c$; by [L2] again, each of them is continuous at $c$. [L2, L3]

1.6 **The limit-point case, claim 4.** Suppose $c$ is a limit point of $A$ and $g(c) \ne 0$. Then $c \in A_0$, and by [L4] the point $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$. By [L3] the limit of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$ exists and equals $f(c)/g(c)$, which is the value of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$; by [L2] applied on the domain $A_0$, that function is continuous at $c$. [L2, L3, L4]

2.1 **Claims 1 and 4 in general.** By [L2] the point $c$ is either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$; step 1.2 settles the first case and steps 1.5 and 1.6 the second. So claims 1 and 4 hold as stated. [step 1.2, step 1.5, step 1.6, L2]

3.1 **Claim 3.** By claim 1 the function $f - g = f + (-1)g$ is continuous at $c$, by step 1.3 so is $|f-g|$, and by claim 1 again so are $f + g + |f-g|$ and its scalar multiple by $1/2$. By step 1.1 that scalar multiple is the function $x \mapsto \max\{f(x), g(x)\}$, so the maximum is continuous at $c$; the same argument with $-|f-g|$ gives the minimum. [step 1.1, step 1.3, step 2.1, L6, L7]

3.2 **Claim 5, powers and polynomials.** The map $x \mapsto x^{0}$ is the constant $1$ and $x \mapsto x^{1}$ is the identity, both continuous on $A$ by step 1.4; and if $x \mapsto x^{n}$ is continuous on $A$ then so is $x \mapsto x^{n+1} = x^{n} \cdot x$, being a product of two functions continuous on $A$ by step 2.1. By induction on $n$, $x \mapsto x^{n}$ is continuous on $A$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. A polynomial function $a_0 + a_1x + \dots + a_nx^{n}$ is obtained from these by finitely many scalar multiplications and additions, each of which preserves continuity by step 2.1. [step 1.4, step 2.1, L8]

4.1 Claims 1 to 5 are proved, all of them at an arbitrary point $c$ of $A$ and therefore, applied at every point, on the whole of $A$; and no sequence and no choice principle was used. [step 1.3, step 2.1, step 3.1, step 3.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the two-case shape, and why it is not an inconvenience.** Continuity is defined at every point of the domain, including isolated points, where no limit exists ([[def-continuity-real]]). The algebra of limits therefore cannot be applied blindly; but at an isolated point every function is continuous, so the case is settled before it is opened. Claims 2 and 5 are proved directly from $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ and need no case distinction at all.

- **Absolute value, maximum and minimum are not in [[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]]**, and the reason is that they are not needed there. They are needed here: the extreme value theorem and the one-dimensional fixed point theorem both build auxiliary functions out of maxima, minima and differences, and [[thm-compactness-is-necessary-for-evt-and-uniform-continuity]] builds its witnesses out of $|x - x_0|$ and quotients.

- **The converse of claim 2 is false**: $|f|$ may be continuous while $f$ is continuous nowhere. The function equal to $1$ on $\mathbb{Q}$ and to $-1$ elsewhere has constant absolute value; that it is nowhere continuous follows from the argument of [[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]] applied verbatim, since that argument uses only that the two values are distinct.

## Statement

Let $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ be sequences of reals ([[def-sequence]]) converging to
$x$ and $y$ respectively ([[def-real-limit]]), and let $c \in \mathbb{R}$. Then

$$x_k + y_k \to x + y, \qquad c\,x_k \to c\,x, \qquad x_k - y_k \to x - y, \qquad x_k y_k \to x y,$$

and if in addition $y \ne 0$ and $y_k \ne 0$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, then

$$\frac{1}{y_k} \to \frac{1}{y} \qquad \text{and} \qquad \frac{x_k}{y_k} \to \frac{x}{y}.$$

The quotient case rests on an eventual lower bound for $|y_k|$, proved below
rather than assumed: $|y_k| > |y|/2$ for all sufficiently large $k$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Sequences $(x_k)$, $(y_k)$ of reals with $(x_k)$ converging to $x$ and $(y_k)$ converging to $y$, and a real $c$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]). For the last two claims we assume in addition $y \ne 0$ and $y_k \ne 0$ for every $k$.

[L1] Convergence, quantified over rational $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-real-limit]]).

[L2] Absolute value and the triangle inequality: $|uv| = |u|\,|v|$, $|u| \ge 0$, $|u| = 0$ if and only if $u = 0$, $|-u| = |u|$, and $|a + b| \le |a| + |b|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L3] Real versus rational $\varepsilon$: for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, by density ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) or by the Archimedean property ([[thm-of-archimedean]]) applied to $1/\eta$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]]); consequently the convergence test of [[def-real-limit]] may equivalently be run with real $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-sequence]]).

[L4] Convergent sequences are bounded ([[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]]), and a constant sequence $(c)$ is bounded by $|c|$ ([[def-sequence]]).

[L5] A null sequence times a bounded sequence is null ([[lem-null-times-bounded]]).

[L6] Reverse triangle inequality: $\bigl||u| - |v|\bigr| \le |u - v|$, hence $|u| \ge |v| - |v - u|$ ([[cor-of-reverse-triangle]]).

[L7] Inverses and order: $a > 0$ implies $a^{-1} > 0$; $0 < a < b$ implies $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$; $(u^{-1})^{-1} = u$ for $u \ne 0$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-field]]).

[L8] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: adding a constant and adding inequalities preserve the order, multiplying a strict inequality by a positive factor preserves it, and $\le$ and $<$ compose transitively; trichotomy holds, and since $u \ge 0$ means $u > 0$ or $u = 0$, an element with $u \ge 0$ and $u \ne 0$ satisfies $u > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]). Moreover $2 = 1 + 1 > 0$ and $2$ is invertible: $0 < 1$ in any ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]) and the positives are closed under addition, so $2 > 0$ and in particular $2 \ne 0$ ([[def-ordered-field]]), whence $2^{-1}$ exists ([[def-field]]).

[L9] Rational arithmetic: $\varepsilon/2$ is a rational $> 0$ whenever $\varepsilon$ is, and $\varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$ ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]); the order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total, so finitely many thresholds admit a common index ([[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Reduction to null sequences: for any sequence $(z_k)$ of reals and any real $z$, the statements "$(z_k)$ converges to $z$" and "$(z_k - z)$ converges to $0$" are literally the same condition, because $|(z_k - z) - 0| = |z_k - z|$ for every $k$. [L1, L2]

1.2 Sum rule, in general form. Let $(u_k) \to u$ and $(v_k) \to v$ be any convergent sequences of reals and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be rational; take $K_1$ with $|u_k - u| < \varepsilon/2$ for $k \ge K_1$ and $K_2$ with $|v_k - v| < \varepsilon/2$ for $k \ge K_2$, and let $K$ be an index at least as large as both. For $k \ge K$, $|(u_k + v_k) - (u + v)| = |(u_k - u) + (v_k - v)| \le |u_k - u| + |v_k - v| < \varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 = \varepsilon$; hence $u_k + v_k \to u + v$, and in particular $x_k + y_k \to x + y$. [L1, L2, L8, L9, algebra]

1.3 Boundedness: every convergent sequence of reals is bounded, and every constant sequence $(d)$ is bounded by $|d|$. [L4]

1.4 Quotient preparation. Assume $y \ne 0$ and $y_k \ne 0$ for every $k$. Then $|y| > 0$ by [L2], so $|y|/2 > 0$; running the convergence test of $(y_k)$ with the real number $|y|/2$ as tolerance, which [L3] licenses, produces $K_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|y_k - y| < |y|/2$ for all $k \ge K_0$. [L1, L2, L3, L7, L8, choose]

2.1 Scalar rule, in general form. Let $(u_k) \to u$ and let $d \in \mathbb{R}$. By step 1.1 the sequence $(u_k - u)$ is null and by step 1.3 the constant sequence $(d)$ is bounded, so $(d(u_k - u)) = (d u_k - d u)$ is null by [L5]; by step 1.1 again, $d u_k \to d u$, and in particular $c x_k \to c x$. [step 1.1, step 1.3, L5, algebra]

2.2 Product rule, in general form. Let $(u_k) \to u$ and $(v_k) \to v$, and write $u_k v_k - u v = u_k(v_k - v) + v(u_k - u)$. By step 1.1 both $(v_k - v)$ and $(u_k - u)$ are null; by step 1.3 both $(u_k)$ and the constant sequence $(v)$ are bounded; so both $(u_k(v_k - v))$ and $(v(u_k - u))$ are null by [L5], and their sum is null by step 1.2 applied with both limits equal to $0$. By step 1.1, $u_k v_k \to u v$, and in particular $x_k y_k \to x y$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, L5, algebra]

2.3 Eventual lower bound. For every $k \ge K_0$, the reverse triangle inequality gives $|y_k| \ge |y| - |y - y_k| = |y| - |y_k - y| > |y| - |y|/2 = |y|/2 > 0$; so $|y_k| > |y|/2$ for all $k \ge K_0$, and in particular $|y_k| \ne 0$ there. [step 1.4, L2, L6, L8]

3.1 Difference rule. Applying step 2.1 to the sequence $(y_k)$ with $d = -1$ gives $-y_k \to -y$; the sum rule of step 1.2 applied to $(x_k)$ and $(-y_k)$ then gives $x_k - y_k = x_k + (-y_k) \to x + (-y) = x - y$. [step 1.2, step 2.1, L8, algebra]

3.2 Reciprocal estimate. For $k \ge K_0$ we have $y_k \ne 0$ and $|y_k| > |y|/2 > 0$, so [L7] applied to $0 < |y|/2 < |y_k|$ gives $0 < |y_k|^{-1} < 2/|y|$, and therefore $\left|\dfrac{1}{y_k} - \dfrac{1}{y}\right| = \dfrac{|y - y_k|}{|y_k|\,|y|} \le \dfrac{2}{|y|^2}\,|y_k - y|$. [step 2.3, L2, L7, L8, algebra]

4.1 Reciprocal rule. Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real and put $\eta := \varepsilon |y|^2/2$, a real $> 0$; by [L3] there is $K_1$ with $|y_k - y| < \eta$ for all $k \ge K_1$. For every $k$ at least as large as both $K_0$ and $K_1$, step 3.2 gives $\left|\dfrac{1}{y_k} - \dfrac{1}{y}\right| \le \dfrac{2}{|y|^2}|y_k - y| < \dfrac{2}{|y|^2}\,\eta = \varepsilon$; hence $1/y_k \to 1/y$. [step 3.2, L1, L3, L7, L8, L9, algebra]

5.1 Quotient rule. By step 4.1 the sequence $(1/y_k)$ converges to $1/y$, so the product rule of step 2.2 applied to $(x_k)$ and $(1/y_k)$ gives $x_k/y_k = x_k \cdot (1/y_k) \to x \cdot (1/y) = x/y$. [step 2.2, step 4.1, algebra]

6.1 All the claims are established: the sum rule in step 1.2, the scalar rule in step 2.1, the difference rule in step 3.1, the product rule in step 2.2, and the reciprocal and quotient rules in steps 4.1 and 5.1. [step 1.2, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, step 4.1, step 5.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The quotient case is where proofs usually cheat.** The estimate $|1/y_k - 1/y| = |y - y_k| / (|y_k||y|)$ is worthless until $|y_k|$ is known to stay away from $0$: without a lower bound the denominator can be arbitrarily small and the fraction arbitrarily large, even while $|y - y_k|$ shrinks. Step 2.3 supplies that bound, $|y_k| > |y|/2$ for $k \ge K_0$, and it is proved from the reverse triangle inequality, not assumed.

- The hypothesis $y_k \ne 0$ for every $k$ is only there so that $1/y_k$ is defined for every index. It is not needed for the limit: step 2.3 shows $|y_k| > |y|/2 > 0$ from $K_0$ on, so a sequence with $y \ne 0$ has at most finitely many zero terms, and by [[lem-limit-of-tail]] one may pass to the $K_0$-th tail and read the conclusion there.

- The hypothesis $y \ne 0$ cannot be dropped. With $x_k = 1$ and $y_k = 1/(k+1)$, both sequences converge: the first is constant ([[def-sequence]]) and the second is null ([[fs-limit-preserves-strict-inequality]]), so $y = 0$. Yet $x_k/y_k = k+1$, and no real $M$ bounds every $k+1$, by the Archimedean property ([[thm-of-archimedean]]); so the quotient sequence is unbounded, hence not convergent by [[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]].

- Nothing in the proof uses completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ beyond the Archimedean property invoked in [L3], so the same rules hold verbatim for sequences of rationals.

## Statement

For each $k \in \mathbb{N}$ let $I_k = [a_k, b_k]$ be a closed bounded interval
with $a_k \le b_k$ ([[def-interval]]), and suppose the family is **nested**:

$$I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k \qquad (k \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Write $\ell_k = b_k - a_k \ge 0$ for the length of $I_k$. Then:

1. $\displaystyle\bigcap_{k \in \mathbb{N}} I_k$ is **nonempty**. More precisely,
   with $a = \sup\{a_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$ and
   $b = \inf\{b_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$, both of which exist, one has $a \le b$
   and $$\bigcap_{k \in \mathbb{N}} I_k = [a, b].$$
2. $\displaystyle\bigcap_{k \in \mathbb{N}} I_k$ is a **single point** if and only
   if $\ell_k \to 0$ ([[def-real-limit]]).

Every hypothesis is load bearing. Dropping closedness makes the intersection
empty; dropping boundedness does the same; and dropping nonemptiness of the
individual intervals is vacuously fatal.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Closed bounded intervals $I_k = [a_k, b_k]$ with $a_k \le b_k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and $I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k$ for every $k$; the sequences $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ of reals ([[def-sequence]]); their ranges $A = \{a_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$ and $B = \{b_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$, both nonempty; and $\ell_k = b_k - a_k$.

[L1] Closed bounded intervals: $[a,b] = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : a \le x \le b\}$; it is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, it is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$, it has two distinct elements $a$ and $b$ when $a < b$, and its length is $b - a$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L2] Least-upper-bound property and uniqueness: a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ bounded above has a unique supremum; the supremum is an upper bound and is $\le$ every upper bound ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L3] Greatest-lower-bound property and uniqueness: a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ bounded below has a unique infimum; the infimum is a lower bound and is $\ge$ every lower bound ([[thm-infimum-property]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).

[L4] Monotone sequences, and the fact that consecutive comparisons suffice: $x_k \le x_{k+1}$ for all $k$ makes $(x_k)$ nondecreasing, and $x_{k+1} \le x_k$ for all $k$ makes it nonincreasing ([[def-monotone-sequence]]).

[L5] Monotone convergence: a nondecreasing sequence whose range is bounded above converges to the supremum of its range, and a nonincreasing sequence whose range is bounded below converges to the infimum ([[thm-monotone-convergence]]).

[L6] Algebra of limits: if $u_k \to u$ and $v_k \to v$ then $u_k - v_k \to u - v$ ([[thm-algebra-of-limits]]).

[L7] A sequence of reals has at most one limit ([[lem-limit-unique]]).

[L8] Bounded above and bounded below, for a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-bounded-set]]).

[L9] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total and transitive, so any two indices $k, l$ admit an index $m$ with $k \le m$ and $l \le m$, namely the larger of the two ([[def-nat-order]], [[thm-nat-linear-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Nestedness read on the endpoints: since $a_{k+1} \le b_{k+1}$, both $a_{k+1}$ and $b_{k+1}$ lie in $I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k$, so $a_k \le a_{k+1}$ and $b_{k+1} \le b_k$ for every $k$. [given, L1]

2.1 Hence $(a_k)$ is nondecreasing and $(b_k)$ is nonincreasing. [step 1.1, L4]

3.1 For all indices $k$ and $l$: choosing $m$ with $k \le m$ and $l \le m$ gives $a_k \le a_m \le b_m \le b_l$, so $a_k \le b_l$. [step 2.1, given, L9]

4.1 Every $b_l$ is therefore an upper bound of $A$ and every $a_k$ a lower bound of $B$; both sets are nonempty, so $a := \sup A$ and $b := \inf B$ exist and are unique. [step 3.1, L2, L3, L8]

5.1 $a \le b$: each $b_l$ is an upper bound of $A$, so $a \le b_l$ for every $l$ by leastness of the supremum; thus $a$ is a lower bound of $B$, and $a \le b$ by greatestness of the infimum. [step 4.1, L2, L3]

5.2 By monotone convergence, $a_k \to a$ and $b_k \to b$. [step 2.1, step 4.1, L5]

5.3 The intersection is exactly $[a,b]$: a real $x$ lies in every $I_k$ exactly when $a_k \le x \le b_k$ for every $k$, that is exactly when $x$ is an upper bound of $A$ and a lower bound of $B$, and by leastness of $a$ and greatestness of $b$ that holds exactly when $a \le x \le b$. [step 4.1, L1, L2, L3]

6.1 $\ell_k = b_k - a_k \to b - a$ by the algebra of limits. [step 5.2, L6]

6.2 Since $a \le b$, the interval $[a,b]$ is nonempty, so the intersection is nonempty; together with step 5.3 this is claim 1. [step 5.1, step 5.3, L1]

7.1 If $\ell_k \to 0$ then $b - a = 0$ by uniqueness of limits, so $a = b$ and the intersection is $[a,a] = \{a\}$, a single point. [step 5.3, step 6.1, L1, L7]

7.2 Conversely, if the intersection is a single point then $a = b$: it equals $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, and $a < b$ would give the two distinct elements $a$ and $b$. Hence $b - a = 0$ and $\ell_k \to 0$ by step 6.1. [step 5.1, step 5.3, step 6.1, L1]

8.1 Claim 1 is step 6.2 and claim 2 is the pair of implications in steps 7.1 and 7.2, so a nested sequence of nonempty closed bounded intervals has nonempty intersection, equal to $[a,b]$, and that intersection is a single point exactly when the lengths tend to $0$. [step 6.2, step 7.1, step 7.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **No Archimedean input is needed.** The lengths are handled entirely by the
  algebra of limits and the uniqueness of limits: $\ell_k$ always converges, to
  $b - a$, and the two directions of claim 2 are then the two directions of
  "$b - a = 0$". A proof that instead argues "if $b - a > 0$ then some $\ell_k$
  is smaller" does need the Archimedean property
  ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]]), and it is avoidable, so it is avoided.

- **Nestedness gives more than it is usually stated to give.** The intersection
  is not merely nonempty; it is the closed interval $[a,b]$, and $a$ and $b$ are
  the limits of the endpoint sequences. The single-point case is exactly the case
  in which those two limits agree, and that is what makes the nested interval
  property usable as a *construction* of a real number, as in
  [[ex-nested-intervals-single-point]].

- **This is one of the standard equivalents of completeness.** Nested intervals
  together with the Archimedean property imply the least-upper-bound property, so
  the implication proved here is not reversible for free: it is half of an
  equivalence whose other half needs the Archimedean hypothesis separately.
  [[rem-completeness-routes]] records where this library stands on those routes.

- **The witnesses for the two deleted hypotheses** are
  [[cex-nested-open-intervals-empty]], which keeps boundedness and drops
  closedness, and [[cex-nested-unbounded-closed-empty]], which keeps closedness
  and drops boundedness. Neither is used above; each shows that the corresponding
  hypothesis cannot be removed.

## Statement

Let $P \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be nonempty and perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]).
Then $P$ is uncountable ([[def-countable]]).

**The selection is canonical, so that this proof spends no dependent choice.**
The textbook proof shrinks a neighbourhood at every stage by *choosing* a point
of $P$ and then a radius, a choice made infinitely often and each time depending
on the previous one: that is the axiom of dependent choice
([[def-dependent-choice]]), which is not available at this point in the reading
order; only the axiom of countable choice is, and it does not
licence a recursive selection. The construction below therefore fixes an
enumeration $e$ of the rationals once ([[thm-rationals-countable]],
[[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) and, at every stage, takes the interval with
**least-indexed rational endpoints** meeting the requirements. The requirements
are met by some rational-endpoint interval, which is what step 2.1 proves, and
the least such index is determined by [[thm-well-ordering-principle]], so the
whole recursion is a single application of [[thm-recursion]] to a total map and
no choice principle is used anywhere.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A nonempty perfect set $P \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Write $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the image of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ under $q \mapsto \hat q$. A pair $(p,q) \in \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \times \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is called **good** when $p < q$ and $(p,q) \cap P \ne \varnothing$, and $G$ denotes the set of good pairs.

[L1] $P$ is perfect: $P$ is closed and every $x \in P$ is a limit point of $P$, so every punctured neighbourhood of $x$ meets $P$ ([[def-perfect-set-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L2] $\overline{A}$ is the set of points every neighbourhood of which meets $A$, and $A$ is closed exactly when $A = \overline{A}$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L3] $N_\varepsilon(x) = (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon)$; $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$; $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) = N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\}$; and $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ with $0 < \delta \le \varepsilon - |y - x|$ gives $N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L4] Intervals: $(p,q)$ is an open set and $[p,q]$ is a closed bounded interval, nonempty when $p \le q$ ([[def-interval]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L5] A nonempty at most countable set admits a surjection from $\mathbb{N}$; uncountable means not at most countable ([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]], [[def-countable]]).

[L6] $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-rationals-countable]]); $q \mapsto \hat q$ is injective with image $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and strictly between any two reals lies an element of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]); a composition of bijections is a bijection ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]], [[def-equinumerous]]).

[L7] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L8] Recursion: for a set $Y$, an element $y_0 \in Y$ and a function $T : Y \to Y$ there is $h : \mathbb{N} \to Y$ with $h(0) = y_0$ and $h(\sigma(k)) = T(h(k))$ ([[thm-recursion]]).

[L9] Nested interval property: for nonempty closed bounded intervals $I_k = [a_k,b_k]$ with $I_{k+1} \subseteq I_k$, the intersection is nonempty, and it is a single point exactly when the lengths $b_k - a_k$ tend to $0$ ([[thm-nested-interval-property]]).

[L10] Reciprocal Archimedean property: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]]); canonical naturals are positive and increasing, and reciprocation of positives reverses the order ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

[L11] Every nonempty finite set of reals has a minimum, which is one of its members ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]); $0 < 1$, so $2 := 1+1 > 0$ and $0 < d \cdot 2^{-1} < d$ for $d > 0$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve inequalities ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

[L12] Convergence of a sequence of reals to $0$ is tested against rational $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-real-limit]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L13] Absolute value: $|z| \ge 0$, and $|y - x| \le b - a$ whenever $x, y \in [a,b]$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that the nonempty perfect set $P$ is at most countable; by [L5] fix a surjection $f : \mathbb{N} \to P$. [assume-contra, L5, choose]

1.2 By [L6] fix a bijection $\beta : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$ and put $e := \iota \circ \beta$ with $\iota(q) = \hat q$, a bijection from $\mathbb{N}$ onto $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$. [L6, choose]

1.3 Recall the terminology of the Given: a pair $(p,q)$ of elements of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is good when $p < q$ and $(p,q) \cap P \ne \varnothing$, and $G$ is the set of good pairs. [given, construct]

2.1 **Refinement claim.** For every good $(p,q)$, every $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and every real $\eta > 0$ there is a good $(p',q')$ with $[p',q'] \subseteq (p,q)$, $x \notin [p',q']$ and $q' - p' < \eta$. To see it, fix $y \in (p,q) \cap P$ and, $(p,q)$ being open, a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(y) \subseteq (p,q)$; since $y \in P$ is not isolated, [L1] gives $z \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(y) \cap P$, so $z \in P \cap (p,q)$ and $z \ne y$. At least one of $y, z$ differs from $x$; let $w$ be $y$ if $y \ne x$ and $z$ otherwise, so $w \in P \cap N_\varepsilon(y)$ and $w \ne x$. Put $\delta := \min\{\, \varepsilon - |w - y|,\ |w - x|,\ \eta \cdot 2^{-1} \,\}$, a positive real by [L11] since each entry is positive, and use [L6] to fix $p', q' \in \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ with $w - \delta < p' < w < q' < w + \delta$. Then $[p',q'] \subseteq N_\delta(w) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(y) \subseteq (p,q)$ by [L3], the pair $(p',q')$ is good because $w \in (p',q') \cap P$, the point $x$ lies outside $N_\delta(w)$ because $|x - w| \ge \delta$, and $q' - p' < 2\delta \le \eta$. [step 1.3, L1, L3, L4, L6, L11, choose]

3.1 **Successor rule.** For $(k,(p,q)) \in \mathbb{N} \times G$ let $m$ be the least natural for which some natural $n$ makes $(e(m),e(n))$ good with $[e(m),e(n)] \subseteq (p,q)$, $f(k) \notin [e(m),e(n)]$ and $e(n) - e(m) < 1/(k+1)$, and let $n$ be the least natural with those properties for that $m$; put $T(k,(p,q)) := (\sigma(k), (e(m),e(n)))$. The set of eligible $m$ is nonempty by step 2.1 applied with $x = f(k)$ and $\eta = 1/(k+1) > 0$, since $e$ is onto $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, so both minima exist by [L7] and $T : \mathbb{N} \times G \to \mathbb{N} \times G$ is a total function defined without any selection. [step 2.1, L6, L7, L10, construct]

4.1 **The recursion.** $P$ is nonempty, so fix $y_0 \in P$ and, by [L6], elements $p_0 < y_0 < q_0$ of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$; then $(p_0,q_0)$ is good. Apply [L8] with $Y = \mathbb{N} \times G$, seed $(0,(p_0,q_0))$ and map $T$ to get $h : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times G$ with $h(0) = (0,(p_0,q_0))$ and $h(\sigma(k)) = T(h(k))$; an induction on $k$ shows the first coordinate of $h(k)$ is $k$, so write $h(k) = (k,(p_k,q_k))$ with every $(p_k,q_k)$ good. [step 1.3, step 3.1, L6, L8, construct]

5.1 Writing $I_k := [p_k,q_k]$ and $\ell_k := q_k - p_k > 0$, the rule of step 3.1 gives, for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$: $I_{k+1} \subseteq (p_k,q_k) \subseteq I_k$, so the intervals are nested and nonempty; $f(k) \notin I_{k+1}$; $\ell_{k+1} < 1/(k+1)$; and $I_k \cap P \ne \varnothing$, because $(p_k,q_k) \cap P \ne \varnothing$. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L4]

6.1 For every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $k \ge 1$ with $\ell_k < \varepsilon$, and moreover $\ell_k \to 0$: by step 5.1 one has $\ell_j < 1/j$ for every $j \ge 1$, since $\ell_j = \ell_{(j-1)+1} < 1/((j-1)+1) = 1/j$; given $\varepsilon > 0$, [L10] supplies a natural $n \ge 1$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$, and then every $k \ge n$ satisfies $k \ge 1$ and $|\ell_k - 0| = \ell_k < 1/k \le 1/n < \varepsilon$ by [L10] and [L13], which is both assertions, the second by [L12] since a rational $\varepsilon > 0$ is in particular a real one. [step 5.1, L10, L12, L13]

7.1 By [L9] the nested family $(I_k)$ of nonempty closed bounded intervals has an intersection that is a single point, since its lengths tend to $0$ by step 6.1; write $\{x\}$ for it, so $x \in I_k$ for every $k$. [step 5.1, step 6.1, L9]

8.1 $x \in P$: let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real and use step 6.1 to fix $k \ge 1$ with $\ell_k < \varepsilon$; by step 5.1 there is $y \in I_k \cap P$, and $x \in I_k$ by step 7.1, so $|y - x| \le \ell_k < \varepsilon$ by [L13] and $y \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap P$. Every neighbourhood of $x$ therefore meets $P$, so $x \in \overline{P} = P$ by [L1] and [L2]. [step 5.1, step 6.1, step 7.1, L1, L2, L3, L13]

9.1 For every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ one has $x \in I_{k+1}$ by step 7.1 while $f(k) \notin I_{k+1}$ by step 5.1, so $x \ne f(k)$; thus the element $x$ of $P$ found in step 8.1 is not a value of $f$, contradicting the surjectivity of the $f$ fixed in step 1.1. The assumption is therefore untenable: a nonempty perfect subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is not at most countable, that is, it is uncountable. [step 1.1, step 5.1, step 7.1, step 8.1, L5, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Which hypothesis does what.** Closedness of $P$ is used exactly once, at the
  step that puts the limit point $x$ back into $P$; without it the construction
  still produces a point, but that point may lie outside $P$ and the
  contradiction evaporates. Having no isolated points is used exactly once, in
  the refinement claim, to produce a second point of $P$ inside a neighbourhood,
  which is what allows the excluded point $f(k)$ to be dodged. Nonemptiness is
  used to seed the recursion, and it cannot be dropped: $\varnothing$ is perfect
  and countable ([[def-perfect-set-r]]).

- **Why rational endpoints.** They are what make the construction canonical.
  The requirement "some good rational-endpoint interval inside $(p,q)$ misses
  $f(k)$ and is short" is a property of a pair of natural numbers, so it can be
  minimised by [[thm-well-ordering-principle]]; the same requirement stated for
  arbitrary real endpoints comes with no canonical least witness, and picking one
  would be a choice made afresh at every stage. This is the same device that
  keeps
  [[lem-subset-of-countable]] and [[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]] choice
  free, transplanted from subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ to intervals.

- **The shrinking condition is $\ell_{k+1} < 1/(k+1)$ and not $1/k$.** Sequences
  and recursions here are indexed from $0$ ([[def-sequence]]), so the bound
  available at stage $k$ has to be positive at $k = 0$; $1/k$ is undefined
  there. The consequence, $\ell_j < 1/j$ for $j \ge 1$, is what step 6.1 uses,
  and it says nothing about $\ell_0$, which is not needed.

- **The result is sharp in both directions.** A nondegenerate closed interval is
  perfect and uncountable ([[ex-closed-interval-is-perfect]]), and deleting the
  no-isolated-points clause loses the conclusion: a closed set with an isolated
  point need not be perfect
  ([[cex-closed-set-with-an-isolated-point-is-not-perfect]]) and may be
  countable, as $\{\, 1/k : k \ge 1 \,\} \cup \{0\}$ is
  ([[ex-reciprocals-with-zero-are-compact]]). Applied to a
  nondegenerate closed interval, which [[ex-closed-interval-is-perfect]] shows
  to be perfect, the theorem reproves the uncountability of intervals
  ([[cor-interval-uncountable]]) by a different route; the two proofs share
  nothing but the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$, which
  [[cor-interval-uncountable]] spends as a supremum and the argument above
  spends through [[thm-nested-interval-property]].

## Statement

Let $(N,0,\sigma)$ be a Peano system ([[def-peano-system]]), in particular the natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]). For any set $A$, any element $a \in A$, and any function $f : A \to A$, there is a unique function $g : N \to A$ such that $g(0) = a$ and $g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n))$ for all $n \in N$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** a Peano system $(N,0,\sigma)$, a set $A$, an element $a \in A$, and a function $f : A \to A$. Call a set $R \subseteq N \times A$ **closed** when $(0,a) \in R$ and, for all $n \in N$ and $x \in A$, $(n,x) \in R$ implies $(\sigma(n),f(x)) \in R$.

[L1] Induction holds in $N$: any $S \subseteq N$ with $0 \in S$ that is closed under $\sigma$ equals $N$ (axiom P3, [[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L2] In a Peano system $\sigma(n) \ne 0$ (P1) and $\sigma$ is injective (P2) ([[def-peano-system]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The set $N \times A$ is closed, so the collection of closed subsets of $N \times A$ is nonempty; let $g := \bigcap \{ R : R \subseteq N \times A \text{ closed} \}$, which is itself closed, since if every closed $R$ contains $(0,a)$ then so does $g$, and if $(n,x) \in g$ then $(n,x) \in R$ for each closed $R$, whence $(\sigma(n),f(x)) \in R$ for each such $R$, so $(\sigma(n),f(x)) \in g$. [given, construct]

2.1 Let $D = \{ n \in N : \exists x \in A,\ (n,x) \in g \}$; then $0 \in D$ since $(0,a) \in g$, and if $n \in D$ with $(n,x) \in g$ then $(\sigma(n),f(x)) \in g$ by closure, so $\sigma(n) \in D$; by induction $D = N$, hence $g$ relates every $n$ to at least one $x$. [L1, step 1.1]

2.2 Suppose $(0,b) \in g$ with $b \ne a$; then $g \setminus \{(0,b)\}$ still contains $(0,a)$ and is closed, since any generated pair $(\sigma(m),f(z))$ has $\sigma(m) \ne 0$ by P1 and so is never equal to $(0,b)$; this contradicts the minimality of $g$, so $a$ is the unique second coordinate paired with $0$. [L2, step 1.1]

3.1 Let $U = \{ n \in N : \text{there is exactly one } x \text{ with } (n,x) \in g \}$; then $0 \in U$ by step 2.2. [step 2.2]

4.1 Assume $n \in U$ with unique value $x$, so $(n,x) \in g$ and $(\sigma(n),f(x)) \in g$ by closure; if $(\sigma(n),c) \in g$ with $c \ne f(x)$, then $g \setminus \{(\sigma(n),c)\}$ contains $(0,a)$ because $\sigma(n) \ne 0$, and is closed, because a generated pair $(\sigma(m),f(z))$ with $(m,z) \in g \setminus \{(\sigma(n),c)\}$ can equal $(\sigma(n),c)$ only if $\sigma(m) = \sigma(n)$ and $f(z) = c$, but $\sigma(m) = \sigma(n)$ forces $m = n$ by injectivity, then $z = x$ by uniqueness at $n$, giving $f(z) = f(x) \ne c$, a contradiction; hence $g \setminus \{(\sigma(n),c)\}$ is closed and smaller than $g$, contradicting minimality, so $f(x)$ is the unique value at $\sigma(n)$ and $\sigma(n) \in U$. [L2, step 3.1, step 1.1]

5.1 By induction $U = N$, so together with the totality from step 2.1 the relation $g$ is a function $g : N \to A$; it satisfies $g(0) = a$, and closure with uniqueness gives $g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n))$ for all $n$. [L1, step 2.1, step 3.1, step 4.1]

6.1 If $h : N \to A$ also satisfies $h(0) = a$ and $h(\sigma(n)) = f(h(n))$, then the set $\{ n : g(n) = h(n) \}$ contains $0$ and is closed under $\sigma$, since $g(n) = h(n)$ implies $g(\sigma(n)) = f(g(n)) = f(h(n)) = h(\sigma(n))$, so by induction it equals $N$, that is $h = g$. [L1, step 5.1] ∎

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. The
following are equivalent.

1. $f$ is continuous at $c$ ([[def-continuity-real]]).
2. For **every** sequence $(x_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ with $x_k \in A$ for every
   $k$ and $x_k \to c$ ([[def-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]), the sequence
   $\bigl(f(x_k)\bigr)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges to $f(c)$.

**The sequences here are not required to avoid $c$**, which is the one
difference from [[thm-sequential-criterion-for-function-limits]] and is exactly
what makes the criterion available at an isolated point of $A$, where no limit
exists.

**The two directions do not cost the same.** The implication from 1 to 2 is
proved in ZF: the sequence is handed to the proof and nothing is selected. The
implication from 2 to 1 is obtained below from
[[thm-sequential-criterion-for-function-limits]], and therefore inherits the one
use of the axiom of countable choice ([[def-countable-choice]]) made in that
theorem's converse direction. What this library does and does not claim about
that cost is recorded once, in [[rem-heine-criterion-choice-cost]], and is not
restated here.

**Nothing else on this page is routed through this theorem.** The algebra of
continuous functions, composition, the intermediate value theorem, the extreme
value theorem and Heine-Cantor are all proved from $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$,
or from compactness, exactly as the previous page organised itself. The
choice-free direction 1 to 2 *is* used, in the intermediate value theorem and in
Heine-Cantor, and each of those two items says which direction it uses.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and a point $c \in A$.

[L1] Continuity at $c$: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L2] A point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$, and never both; $c$ is isolated in $A$ when $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ for some real $\eta > 0$ ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] At a limit point $c$ of $A$, $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if the limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and equals $f(c)$; at an isolated point of $A$ every function is continuous ([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-function-limit]]).

[L4] Heine criterion for limits: at a limit point $c$ of $A$, $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$ holds if and only if $f(x_k) \to L$ for every sequence $(x_k)$ with $x_k \in A$, $x_k \ne c$ for every $k$, and $x_k \to c$. The direction from the limit to sequences is a theorem of ZF; the converse uses the axiom of countable choice exactly once ([[thm-sequential-criterion-for-function-limits]], [[def-countable-choice]]).

[L5] Convergence of a real sequence: $x_k \to x$ when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$; below every positive real lies a positive rational, so the test may equally be run at every real $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-real-limit]], [[def-sequence]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L6] Absolute value: $|u| \ge 0$, and $|u| = 0$ exactly when $u = 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **The isolated case, both statements at once.** Suppose $c$ is an isolated point of $A$ and fix a real $\eta > 0$ with $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$. Then statement 1 holds by [L3]. Statement 2 also holds: if $x_k \in A$ for every $k$ and $x_k \to c$, then by [L5] there is $K$ with $|x_k - c| < \eta$ for all $k \ge K$, so $x_k \in N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ and hence $x_k = c$ and $f(x_k) = f(c)$ for all $k \ge K$; a sequence eventually equal to $f(c)$ converges to $f(c)$, since $|f(x_k) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$ for $k \ge K$. So 1 and 2 are both true, and in particular equivalent. [L2, L3, L5, L6]

1.2 **The limit-point case, from 1 to 2.** Suppose $c$ is a limit point of $A$ and that $f$ is continuous at $c$. Let $(x_k)$ satisfy $x_k \in A$ for every $k$ and $x_k \to c$, and let a rational $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. By [L1] fix a real $\delta > 0$ with $|f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ for every $x \in A$ satisfying $|x - c| < \delta$; by [L5] fix $K$ with $|x_k - c| < \delta$ for all $k \ge K$. Every such $k$ has $x_k \in A$ and $|x_k - c| < \delta$, hence $|f(x_k) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$. As the rational $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary, $f(x_k) \to f(c)$. Nothing was selected, so this is a theorem of ZF. [L1, L5]

1.3 **The limit-point case, from 2 to 1.** Suppose $c$ is a limit point of $A$ and that statement 2 holds. Every sequence $(x_k)$ with $x_k \in A$, $x_k \ne c$ for every $k$, and $x_k \to c$ is in particular a sequence in $A$ converging to $c$, so statement 2 gives $f(x_k) \to f(c)$. That is the right-hand side of [L4] with $L := f(c)$, so [L4] yields that the limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and equals $f(c)$, and [L3] turns that into continuity of $f$ at $c$. This is the direction that inherits the single use of countable choice made in [L4]. [L3, L4]

2.1 By [L2] the point $c$ is either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$. In the first case step 1.1 proves both statements outright; in the second, step 1.2 gives 1 implies 2 and step 1.3 gives 2 implies 1. So statements 1 and 2 are equivalent, with the first implication free of choice and the second inheriting exactly one application of countable choice. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, L2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the sequences are allowed to hit $c$.** [[thm-sequential-criterion-for-function-limits]] must exclude $c$, because [[def-function-limit]] says nothing about $f(c)$ and a sequence constantly equal to $c$ would test the wrong thing. Continuity does look at $f(c)$, so no exclusion is needed, and dropping it is what makes statement 2 meaningful at an isolated point, where the only sequences converging to $c$ are those eventually equal to $c$.

- **What the choice cost is, and what it is not.** The claim recorded here is that the proof *given above* of 2 implies 1 uses countable choice, through [[thm-sequential-criterion-for-function-limits]]. No claim is made that it is necessary; [[rem-heine-criterion-choice-cost]] states in full what this library does and does not assert, including Sierpiński's ZF theorem that a function continuous sequentially at *every* point of $\mathbb{R}$ is continuous, which shows the everywhere-statement and the pointwise statement behave differently.

- **The negative use is the common one.** To show that $f$ is *not* continuous at $c$ it suffices to exhibit one sequence in $A$ converging to $c$ whose image sequence does not converge to $f(c)$, and that uses only the choice-free direction. [[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]] on the companion page is proved without sequences at all, directly from density, which is cheaper still.
