You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as a
read-only adversarial proof-refuter for the published-page audit. You are
tool-less: you cannot open a file, run a command, browse, edit, or delegate.
Everything you may rely on is reproduced in the `This dispatch` section. Return
evidence only; Audit-Alpha alone adjudicates and edits.

## Triage — the standing rule (verbatim, binding on you)

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct
  citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

## Adversarial standard

Read the target's title, Statement/Definition/Example/Statement refuted, Facts &
Assumptions, every numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks.
Try to falsify the public claim and every load-bearing inference.

1. Compare every cited fact with the supplied source text before alleging that
   it is weak. Check domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, direction, conclusion,
   and whether the source licenses the exact use.
2. Check that the title and public statement assert no more than the proof
   establishes, and that every proof step uses only available premises.
3. Check both directions of biconditionals, uniqueness/existence claims,
   induction and limiting arguments, empty/zero/endpoint/degenerate cases,
   extended-real conventions, index shifts, and hidden division or choice.
4. Re-read Remarks as skeptically as a numbered step. A false mathematical
   remark is a defect even when the proof is sound.
5. When the target is marked `ai-generated`, actively search for a
   counterexample to its claim, witness, or refutation rather than merely
   checking prose consistency.
6. Treat a false public claim, logically invalid proof, missing necessary
   hypothesis, circularity, or materially inaccurate load-bearing citation as
   fatal. Do not inflate an expository omission or a gap closable within thirty
   seconds into a defect.

## Output format

Reply with exactly this structure and no preamble:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

If `DEFECTS`, give one block per finding:

```text
FINDING 1
  location: [exact title, section, fact label, or numbered step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [the exact mathematical assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, missing hypothesis, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]
```

Then always end with:

```text
BOUNDARY: [specific boundary/counterexample checks and their disposition]
SOURCES:  [confirm every supplied cited item used by the target was inspected]
CHECKED:  [confirm the title, public claim, every numbered step, and Remarks were read]

## Statement

Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals. The following are equivalent.

1. $\sum a_k$ converges absolutely
   ([[def-absolute-and-conditional-convergence]]).
2. $\sum a_k$ converges unconditionally
   ([[def-rearrangement-and-unconditional-convergence]]).
3. $\sum a_k$ converges and every rearrangement of it converges, with no
   requirement that the sums agree.

So over $\mathbb{R}$ there is nothing between absolute and conditional
convergence: a convergent series either may be reordered freely, sum and all, or
else has a rearrangement that fails to converge at all.

**This is a statement about $\mathbb{R}$, and nothing here says how much of it
survives elsewhere.** Whether the equivalence of 1 and 2 holds for series of
vectors is a question this library cannot pose at this point in the reading
order, since it has no notion of a convergent series of vectors; it is raised,
and left open, in [[rem-rearrangement-in-higher-dimensions]]. No claim about any
space other than $\mathbb{R}$ is made or used here.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(a_k)$ of reals.

[L1] An absolutely convergent series converges unconditionally: every rearrangement converges, to the same sum ([[thm-dirichlet-rearrangement]]).

[L2] If $\sum a_k$ converges conditionally then for every $\alpha \le \beta$ in the extended reals there is a rearrangement whose partial sums have those as limit inferior and limit superior; in particular there is one whose partial sums diverge to $+\infty$ ([[thm-riemann-series-theorem]]).

[L3] Unconditional convergence means: the series converges, and every rearrangement converges to the same sum ([[def-rearrangement-and-unconditional-convergence]]).

[L4] A series converges absolutely when $\sum |a_k|$ converges, and conditionally when it converges while $\sum |a_k|$ does not; a convergent series is exactly one of the two ([[def-absolute-and-conditional-convergence]]).

[L5] A sequence diverging to $+\infty$ does not converge: if $x_n \to +\infty$ and also $x_n \to L$, then eventually $x_n > L + 1$ and eventually $|x_n - L| < 1$, which are incompatible ([[def-divergence-to-infinity]], [[def-real-limit]], [[def-series]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Assume 1. Then by [L1] the series converges and every rearrangement converges to the same sum, which is 2. [L1, L3]

1.2 Assume 2. Then in particular the series converges and every rearrangement converges, which is 3. [L3]

1.3 Assume 3, and suppose $\sum a_k$ did not converge absolutely. Since it converges, it would then converge conditionally. [L4]

2.1 In that situation [L2] supplies a bijection $\sigma$ of $\mathbb{N}$ for which the partial sums of $\sum a_{\sigma(k)}$ diverge to $+\infty$, and such a series does not converge; this contradicts the assumption that every rearrangement converges. [step 1.3, L2, L5]

3.1 Hence under 3 the series converges absolutely, which is 1. [step 1.3, step 2.1, L4]

4.1 The implications 1 to 2, 2 to 3 and 3 to 1 close the cycle, so the three statements are equivalent. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Statement 3 is the reason the corollary is worth recording.** It says that merely *asking* every rearrangement to converge already forces absolute convergence, so the apparently weaker demand is not weaker at all. What makes that work is the strength of [[thm-riemann-series-theorem]]: it produces not only rearrangements with prescribed sums but rearrangements with no sum.

- **Two of the three implications are cheap.** The content is in 3 implies 1, and its only ingredient is the Riemann series theorem. The implication 1 implies 2 is [[thm-dirichlet-rearrangement]] verbatim, and 2 implies 3 is a weakening.

- **Where the dividing line sits.** By [[def-absolute-and-conditional-convergence]] a convergent series is absolutely or conditionally convergent and not both, so the corollary may be read as: the conditionally convergent series are exactly the convergent series that are not unconditionally convergent. The alternating harmonic series is the standard inhabitant of that class; see [[fs-rearrangement-preserves-the-sum]].

## Definition

Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals, with series $\sum a_k$ and partial sums
$s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ as in [[def-series]], and let $|x|$ be the absolute value
([[def-abs-value]]).

**Absolute convergence.** The series $\sum a_k$ **converges absolutely** when the
series $\sum |a_k|$ converges ([[def-series]]). Since $|a_k| \ge 0$ for every $k$
([[lem-of-abs-value]]), this is a statement about a series of nonnegative terms.

**Conditional convergence.** The series $\sum a_k$ **converges conditionally**
when it converges ([[def-series]], [[def-real-limit]]) and does *not* converge
absolutely.

So a convergent series is exactly one of the two: absolutely convergent or
conditionally convergent, according as $\sum |a_k|$ converges or not.

**One implication is already proved, and is not reproved anywhere on this page.**
[[lem-absolute-convergence-implies-convergence]] states that if $\sum |a_k|$
converges then $\sum a_k$ converges. That lemma was coined and proved on the
previous page of this track, where the root and ratio tests need it; this page
names it and builds on it. In particular an absolutely convergent series is a
convergent series, so the two words above really do partition the convergent
series, and "conditionally convergent" is not vacuous by accident: the alternating
harmonic series is a witness, and the witness is exhibited in
[[fs-convergent-implies-absolutely-convergent]].

**General starting index.** Let $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $(a_k)_{k \ge m}$ be a
family from $m$ ([[def-series]]). The series $\sum_{k \ge m} a_k$ **converges
absolutely** when $\sum_{k \ge m} |a_k|$ converges, and **converges
conditionally** when it converges and does not converge absolutely. By
[[def-series]] both statements are the corresponding statements for the shifted
sequence $j \mapsto a_{j+m}$, so nothing new is being defined and every result
below transfers to a general starting index in the same way, exactly as
[[lem-absolute-convergence-implies-convergence]] already records for the one
implication it proves.

## Remarks

- **Absolute convergence is a condition on the terms, not on the sum.** It says
  the series of absolute values converges, and it says nothing about the value of
  $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k$. The two sums are in general different, and no
  statement here identifies them.

- **Why the distinction earns a page.** Every result on this page separates the
  two classes. An absolutely convergent series may be reordered at will
  ([[thm-dirichlet-rearrangement]]) and multiplied by another
  ([[thm-mertens]]); a conditionally convergent one may be reordered to any sum
  whatever ([[thm-riemann-series-theorem]]). The difference is not one of degree.

- **A series of nonnegative terms converges absolutely if it converges at all**,
  since then $|a_k| = a_k$. So the distinction is invisible for the comparison,
  condensation, Raabe, Gauss and Kummer tests of the previous page, all of which
  assume terms of one sign. It is not invisible on that page as a whole: the root
  and ratio tests are stated for terms of arbitrary sign and reach convergence of
  $\sum a_k$ precisely through
  [[lem-absolute-convergence-implies-convergence]], which is where the word
  *absolutely convergent* is first used. What that page does not develop, and this
  one does, is everything that separates the two classes rather than the one
  implication those two tests need.

## Definition

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]), with $\mathbb{R}$ ordered
as in [[def-real-order]] and [[def-complete-ordered-field]].

- $(x_k)$ **diverges to $+\infty$**, written $x_k \to +\infty$, when for every
  $M \in \mathbb{R}$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x_k > M$ for all
  $k \ge K$.
- $(x_k)$ **diverges to $-\infty$**, written $x_k \to -\infty$, when for every
  $M \in \mathbb{R}$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x_k < M$ for all
  $k \ge K$.

Equivalently, in the language of [[def-sequence]]: $x_k \to +\infty$ when the
property $x_k > M$ holds eventually, for every real $M$.

## Remarks

- **This is divergence, not convergence.** The symbols $+\infty$ and $-\infty$
  are **not real numbers**: $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
  ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and contains no element larger than every
  element of itself. Nothing above claims that $(x_k)$ has a limit in the sense
  of [[def-real-limit]], and nothing above defines an object named $+\infty$.
  The whole phrase "$x_k \to +\infty$" is a single abbreviation for the
  displayed condition, exactly as "$(x_k)$ is Cauchy" is an abbreviation for a
  condition and not a claim that some object called a Cauchy value exists.

- **A sequence diverging to $+\infty$ really does diverge.** Suppose
  $x_k \to +\infty$. Given any real $M$, there is $K$ with $x_k > M$ for all
  $k \ge K$; in particular $x_K > M$, so no real $M$ satisfies $x_k \le M$ for
  all $k$. Since $x_k \le |x_k|$ always ([[lem-of-abs-value]]), a bound
  $|x_k| \le M$ valid for all $k$ would give $x_k \le M$ for all $k$, which has
  just been excluded, so no such $M$ exists either. Thus
  $(x_k)$ is unbounded, and an unbounded sequence cannot converge, since
  convergent sequences are bounded ([[lem-convergent-implies-bounded]]). The
  same argument applies to $-\infty$. So the two notions never overlap: a
  sequence that diverges to $\pm\infty$ has no limit whatever.

- **Consequently $\lim_k x_k$ is not written here.** Many texts write
  $\lim_k x_k = +\infty$. This library does not, for the reason recorded in
  [[rem-sup-conventions]] about $\sup S = +\infty$: writing an equation whose
  right-hand side is not an element of $\mathbb{R}$ silently moves the discussion
  into the extended real line, a structure that is not a field, and every
  subsequent algebraic step then needs its own justification. In particular none
  of the rules of [[thm-algebra-of-limits]] may be applied to a divergence to
  $\pm\infty$; the familiar slogans "$\infty + \infty = \infty$" and
  "$\infty \cdot \infty = \infty$" are separate statements about this definition
  and would need separate proofs.

- **Testing against naturals suffices.** Since $\mathbb{R}$ is Archimedean
  ([[thm-of-archimedean]]), every real $M$ is below some canonical natural $n$,
  so the condition "for every real $M$" may equivalently be read as "for every
  natural $n \ge 1$"; the two formulations of $x_k \to +\infty$ agree.

- **Divergence to $+\infty$ is much stronger than divergence.** A sequence
  alternating between $1$ and $-1$ diverges ([[fs-bounded-implies-convergent]])
  but goes to neither $+\infty$ nor $-\infty$, since it is bounded. Divergence
  is the negation of convergence; divergence to $+\infty$ is a positive
  statement about growth.

## Definition

A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals **converges** to $x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for
every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with
$|x_k - x| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$. It is **Cauchy** when for
every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with
$|x_k - x_l| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$.

## Remarks

- Quantifying over rational $\varepsilon$ loses nothing: below any real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ lies a positive rational ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).
- $|\cdot|$ is the absolute value of [[def-real-order]].

## Definition

Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]) and let
$\sigma : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ be a bijection
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

**Rearrangement.** The **rearrangement of $(a_k)$ along $\sigma$** is the
composite sequence $k \mapsto a_{\sigma(k)}$, again a function
$\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ and so again a sequence of reals. The
**rearrangement of the series $\sum a_k$ along $\sigma$** is the series
$\sum a_{\sigma(k)}$ of that sequence ([[def-series]]).

A rearrangement uses each term of the original sequence exactly once: injectivity
of $\sigma$ says no term is repeated, surjectivity says none is omitted. That is
the whole content of the word, and it is why the definition is stated with a
bijection rather than with an informal "reordering".

**Unconditional convergence.** The series $\sum a_k$ **converges
unconditionally** when it converges and, for **every** bijection
$\sigma : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$, the rearranged series $\sum a_{\sigma(k)}$
converges with

$$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_{\sigma(k)} \;=\; \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k .$$

## Remarks

- **Unconditional convergence implies convergence, by definition and also by
  instance.** The identity map is a bijection of $\mathbb{N}$ and the
  rearrangement along it is the original sequence, so the clause about all
  bijections already contains the clause about the series itself.

- **Rearranging twice is rearranging once.** If $\sigma$ and $\tau$ are bijections
  of $\mathbb{N}$ then so is $\sigma \circ \tau$, and the rearrangement of
  $(a_{\sigma(k)})$ along $\tau$ is $k \mapsto a_{\sigma(\tau(k))}$, the
  rearrangement of $(a_k)$ along $\sigma \circ \tau$. Likewise the inverse
  $\sigma^{-1}$ is a bijection, and rearranging along it undoes $\sigma$. Both
  facts are used in [[thm-dirichlet-rearrangement]].

- **A weaker-looking condition, which turns out to be the same one.** One could
  ask only that every rearrangement *converge*, without requiring the sums to
  agree. Over $\mathbb{R}$ that is not weaker:
  [[cor-unconditional-iff-absolute-in-r]] identifies both conditions with absolute
  convergence ([[def-absolute-and-conditional-convergence]]), because
  [[thm-riemann-series-theorem]] produces, for a series that converges but not
  absolutely, both a rearrangement with a different sum and a rearrangement that
  does not converge at all.

- **The definition says nothing about which series have the property.** That is
  the subject of the two theorems that follow, and the answer over $\mathbb{R}$ is
  exactly the absolutely convergent series.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-real-numbers]]) and
a **sequence of reals** is a function $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$
([[def-sequence]]), written $(a_k)$; recall that $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$.

**Partial sums.** Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals. Its **sequence of partial
sums** is

$$s_n \;:=\; \sum_{k < n} a_k \qquad (n \in \mathbb{N}),$$

the finite sum of [[def-finite-sum]]. In particular $s_0 = 0$, the empty sum, and
$s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ for every $n$, those being exactly the two recursion clauses
that define the finite sum. Note that $s_n$ is the sum of the $n$ terms
$a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$, so the index $n$ counts terms rather than naming the last
one.

**Convergence, the sum, divergence.** The **series** of $(a_k)$, written
$\sum a_k$, **converges** when the sequence $(s_n)$ of partial sums converges
([[def-real-limit]]), and then the **sum of the series** is

$$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k \;:=\; \lim_{n} s_n .$$

The series **diverges** when $(s_n)$ does not converge. A convergent sequence of
reals has exactly one limit ([[lem-limit-unique]]), so the displayed symbol names
a single real number and nothing further has to be checked for it to be
well defined.

**Series with a general starting index.** Let $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $a$ be a
function on $\{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : k \ge m \,\}$, which we call a **family from
$m$** and write $(a_k)_{k \ge m}$. The series

$$\sum_{k \ge m} a_k$$

is by definition the series of the sequence $b_j := a_{j + m}$,
$j \in \mathbb{N}$, which is a genuine sequence of reals; it converges exactly
when that series converges, and its sum is then written
$\sum_{k = m}^{\infty} a_k$. Its partial sums are

$$\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} a_k \;=\; \sum_{j < n-m} a_{m+j} \qquad (n \ge m),$$

in the notation of [[def-finite-sum]], the value at $n = m$ being the empty sum
$0$. A sequence on $\mathbb{N}$ is the case $m = 0$, and the two readings of
$\sum a_k$ agree there, since $b_j = a_j$.

**This clause is not a convenience.** Sequences in this library are functions on
$\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$ ([[def-sequence]]), while many of the
classical series are built from expressions that are undefined at the index $0$:
$1/k$, $1/k^{p}$ and $|a_k|^{1/k}$ all require $k \ge 1$. Writing such a series as
$\sum_{k \ge 1} a_k$ names an honest object, whereas writing it as a sequence on
$\mathbb{N}$ would require a value at an index where the defining expression has
none. Every statement on this page says which starting index it uses.

**Tail series.** For $N \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$N$-th tail series** of
$\sum a_k$ is $\sum_{k \ge N} a_k$, that is the series of the $N$-th tail
$a^{(N)}$ of [[def-sequence]], whose terms are $a^{(N)}_j = a_{j+N}$. The
$0$-th tail series is the series itself.

## Remarks

- **"Diverges" here means "does not converge", and nothing more.** A divergent
  series may have partial sums that run away to $+\infty$, or to $-\infty$, or
  that oscillate without settling anywhere. The three behaviours are not
  distinguished by the word, and no statement on this page uses "diverges" to
  mean "the partial sums are unbounded" unless it says so.

- **The symbol $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k$ is defined only for a convergent
  series.** It denotes a real number, not a formal object, and it is illegitimate
  to write it down before convergence has been established. Where a proof needs
  to speak of the series without knowing whether it converges, it speaks of
  $(a_k)$ and of $(s_n)$.

- **Two indices, doing different work.** The index $k$ runs over the terms and is
  bound; the index $n$ runs over the partial sums and is the variable in which the
  limit is taken. Confusing them is the commonest slip in the subject, and it is
  the reason the definition above fixes $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_k$ rather than
  $\sum_{k \le n} a_k$: with this choice the recursion $s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ is
  the one supplied by [[def-finite-sum]], with no shift anywhere.

## Statement

**False claim:** for every sequence $(a_k)$ of reals whose series converges
([[def-series]]) and every bijection $\sigma : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$, the
rearranged series $\sum a_{\sigma(k)}$
([[def-rearrangement-and-unconditional-convergence]]) converges, with the same
sum.

What is true is that hypothesis: the claim holds for **absolutely** convergent
series, and that is [[thm-dirichlet-rearrangement]]. Dropping "absolutely" makes
it false in both of its assertions at once, and the same witness refutes both.

Let $(\varepsilon_j)$ be the alternating sequence ([[lem-alternating-sequence]])
and put $a_j := \varepsilon_j/\iota(j+1)$, the alternating harmonic series. It
converges, by the alternating series test, and does not converge absolutely, its
series of absolute values being the harmonic series
([[thm-p-series-rational]]). So it converges conditionally, and
[[thm-riemann-series-theorem]] applies to it.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The alternating sequence $(\varepsilon_j)$, the sequence $b_j := 1/\iota(j+1)$, and $a_j := \varepsilon_j b_j$, whose series is the alternating harmonic series.

[A1] The refuted claim: for every convergent series of reals and every bijection of $\mathbb{N}$, the rearranged series converges with the same sum.

[L1] $|\varepsilon_j| = 1$ for every $j$ ([[lem-alternating-sequence]]).

[L2] The canonical naturals $\iota(n)$ are positive for $n \ge 1$ and strictly increasing; if $0 < u < v$ then $0 < 1/v < 1/u$; and for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $n \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(n) < \varepsilon$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]]).

[L3] The alternating series test ([[thm-alternating-series-test]], [[def-monotone-sequence]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L4] $\sum_{k\ge1} 1/k^{p}$ converges if and only if $p > 1$, with $\iota(k)^{1} = \iota(k)$; and $\sum_{k \ge 1} x_k$ is the series of $j \mapsto x_{j+1}$ ([[thm-p-series-rational]], [[def-rational-power]], [[thm-nth-roots-exist]], [[def-integer-power]], [[def-series]]).

[L5] Absolute value: $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L6] Absolute and conditional convergence ([[def-absolute-and-conditional-convergence]]).

[L7] The Riemann series theorem: a conditionally convergent series has, for every real $c$, a rearrangement converging to $c$, and one whose partial sums diverge to $+\infty$ ([[thm-riemann-series-theorem]], [[def-divergence-to-infinity]]).

[L8] An absolutely convergent series converges unconditionally ([[thm-dirichlet-rearrangement]]).

## Refutation

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The sequence $(b_j)$ is positive, nonincreasing and converges to $0$: positivity and monotonicity from $0 < \iota(j+1) < \iota(j+2)$, and convergence because, given a rational $\varepsilon > 0$, an $n \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(n) < \varepsilon$ satisfies $b_j \le 1/\iota(n) < \varepsilon$ for every $j \ge n$. [given, L2]

2.1 By the alternating series test $\sum a_j$ converges; write $S$ for its sum. [step 1.1, L3]

2.2 For every $j$, $|a_j| = |\varepsilon_j| b_j = 1/\iota(j+1)$, and $\sum_j 1/\iota(j+1)$ is the $p$-series $\sum_{k\ge1}1/k$ at $p = 1$, which diverges. [step 1.1, L1, L4, L5]

3.1 So $\sum a_j$ converges conditionally. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L6]

4.1 By the Riemann series theorem there is a bijection $\sigma$ of $\mathbb{N}$ with $\sum a_{\sigma(k)}$ convergent of sum $S + 1$, a number different from $S$. [step 3.1, L7]

4.2 By the same theorem there is a bijection $\tau$ of $\mathbb{N}$ for which the partial sums of $\sum a_{\tau(k)}$ diverge to $+\infty$, so that rearranged series does not converge at all. [step 3.1, L7]

5.1 The claim [A1] therefore fails twice over for the alternating harmonic series: once in its assertion that the sum is preserved, by step 4.1, and once in its assertion that the rearranged series converges, by step 4.2. [step 4.1, step 4.2, A1]

6.1 The claim is false. What is true is the same statement with "converges" strengthened to "converges absolutely" in the hypothesis. [step 5.1, A1, L8] ∎

## Remarks

- **Neither half of the claim survives.** It is often stated as though the only risk were a change of value; step 4.2 shows the rearranged series may fail to converge, and [[thm-riemann-series-theorem]] shows the partial sums may be made to oscillate between any two prescribed extended reals.

- **The hypothesis that repairs the claim is exactly the right one.** By [[cor-unconditional-iff-absolute-in-r]], absolute convergence is not merely sufficient for the conclusion but necessary: a convergent series all of whose rearrangements converge is absolutely convergent. So there is no intermediate hypothesis to look for.

- **What is fixed and what is not.** The terms of the series are fixed; only the order changes. That an infinite sum should depend on the order at all is the point of the example, and it is why [[def-series]] defines the sum as the limit of the partial sums of a *sequence*, not as a sum over a set of indices.

## Remark

Everything on this page is about series of **real numbers**, and the answer it
reaches is complete for that case. Write

$$\mathcal{S}(a) \;:=\; \Bigl\{\, s \in \mathbb{R} \ : \ \text{some rearrangement of } \sum a_k \text{ converges to } s \,\Bigr\}$$

for the **set of rearrangement sums** of a convergent series
([[def-rearrangement-and-unconditional-convergence]]). Then this page determines
$\mathcal{S}(a)$ exactly, in two cases and no others.

- If $\sum a_k$ converges absolutely, $\mathcal{S}(a)$ is the single point
  $\bigl\{\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k\bigr\}$: that is
  [[thm-dirichlet-rearrangement]].
- If $\sum a_k$ converges conditionally, $\mathcal{S}(a)$ is the whole of
  $\mathbb{R}$: that is [[thm-riemann-series-theorem]], and moreover
  rearrangements exist whose partial sums diverge to $+\infty$ or to $-\infty$ or
  oscillate between any prescribed pair of extended reals.

[[cor-unconditional-iff-absolute-in-r]] is the statement that these two cases are
distinguished by absolute convergence and by nothing else.

**The same question can be asked of a series of vectors**, once one has a space in
which a series of vectors has a sum: given a convergent series in $\mathbb{R}^d$,
what does its set of rearrangement sums look like? That question was raised by
Paul Lévy in 1905 and taken up by Ernst Steinitz in 1913, and later by Wacław
Sierpiński; the references below are to those papers, and they are given as the
origin of the question. **What the literature answers is not stated here in any
form, and nothing on this page or anywhere else in this library depends on it.**
Part of it is now proved, later in the reading order and marked as forward
material: [[thm-steinitz-polygonal-confinement]] and
[[thm-rearrangement-sums-lie-in-an-affine-subspace]] establish that the set of
rearrangement sums is nonempty and lies inside an affine subspace. The reverse
inclusion, which is what would turn that containment into the classical answer,
is still proved nowhere here.

The reason is a matter of reading order, not of difficulty or of interest. Stating
the theorem requires $\mathbb{R}^d$ as a normed space (a norm, convergence of
vector sequences, and a notion of a convergent series of vectors), and that
vocabulary is introduced later in the reading order than this page. Rather than
borrow it, or state a theorem whose terms are not yet defined, the obligation is
recorded where it can be discharged: on the page that builds $\mathbb{R}^d$ as a
normed space and afterwards. When that page is reached, the question raised here
is the one it will answer.

**What is safe to say now, and is worth saying.** The one-dimensional dichotomy
above is stark: a single point, or everything. Nothing in the proof of
[[thm-riemann-series-theorem]] survives verbatim in higher dimensions, because it
is built on the order of $\mathbb{R}$: the greedy rule "add positive terms until
the running sum exceeds the target, then negative ones until it falls below"
presupposes that the terms are signed and that the target can be approached from
two sides. In $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d \ge 2$ there is no such order, the terms
point in many directions, and the argument has no analogue. A reader who expects
the one-dimensional answer to generalise unchanged should treat that expectation
as unsupported until the later page settles it.

## Statement

Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals whose series converges absolutely
([[def-absolute-and-conditional-convergence]]), and let
$\sigma : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ be a bijection
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]). Then:

1. $\sum |a_{\sigma(k)}|$ converges, with
   $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} |a_{\sigma(k)}| = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} |a_k|$; that is,
   the rearranged series again converges absolutely;
2. $\sum a_{\sigma(k)}$ converges, with
   $$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_{\sigma(k)} \;=\; \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k .$$

Consequently an absolutely convergent series converges unconditionally
([[def-rearrangement-and-unconditional-convergence]]).

The engine of the proof is a single statement about series of **nonnegative**
terms: for those, the sum is the supremum of the partial sums
([[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]]), a quantity that cannot see the
order of the terms. The general case is reduced to that one through the positive
and negative parts ([[lem-positive-and-negative-parts]]), which is why no
manipulation of signed finite sums over shuffled index sets occurs anywhere below.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(a_k)$ of reals with $\sum |a_k|$ convergent, and a bijection $\sigma : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$.

[L1] Finite sums: $\sum_{k<0} x_k = 0$, $\sum_{k<n+1} x_k = \sum_{k<n} x_k + x_n$, and a finite sum may be split at any intermediate index ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L2] Monotonicity of finite sums: if $x_k \le y_k$ for all $k < n$ then $\sum_{k<n} x_k \le \sum_{k<n} y_k$; in particular a finite sum of nonnegative terms is nonnegative ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L3] For a series of nonnegative terms, convergence is equivalent to the range of the partial sums being bounded above, and then the sum is the supremum of that range; in particular every partial sum is at most the sum ([[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]], [[def-series]]).

[L4] Limits preserve non-strict inequalities holding eventually ([[lem-limit-preserves-order]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L5] The principle of induction on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L6] A bijection is injective and surjective; $f[S]$ and $f^{-1}[T]$ denote image and preimage ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L7] Positive and negative parts: $a_k^{+} = (|a_k| + a_k)/2$ and $a_k^{-} = (|a_k| - a_k)/2$ are nonnegative, $a_k = a_k^{+} - a_k^{-}$, $|a_k| = a_k^{+} + a_k^{-}$, and $\sum |a_k|$ converges if and only if both $\sum a_k^{+}$ and $\sum a_k^{-}$ converge ([[lem-positive-and-negative-parts]]).

[L8] Linearity of series ([[lem-series-linearity]]).

[L9] If $\sum |x_k|$ converges then $\sum x_k$ converges ([[lem-absolute-convergence-implies-convergence]]).

[L10] Unconditional convergence means every rearrangement converges to the same sum ([[def-rearrangement-and-unconditional-convergence]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Finite domination.** For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the following holds: for every sequence $(c_k)$ of nonnegative reals, every $Q \in \mathbb{N}$ and every injective map $\tau$ from $\{k : k < n\}$ into $\{k : k < Q\}$, one has $\sum_{k<n} c_{\tau(k)} \le \sum_{k<Q} c_k$. This is proved by induction on $n$, the sequence, $Q$ and $\tau$ being universally quantified inside the induction statement. At $n = 0$ the left side is the empty sum $0$ and the right side is nonnegative. Assume the statement at $n$, and let $\tau$ be injective from $\{k : k < n+1\}$ into $\{k : k < Q\}$; put $p := \tau(n)$, so $p < Q$, and let $(c'_k)$ agree with $(c_k)$ except that $c'_p := 0$, again a nonnegative sequence. The restriction of $\tau$ to $\{k : k < n\}$ is injective into $\{k : k < Q\}$ and never takes the value $p$, so $c'_{\tau(k)} = c_{\tau(k)}$ for $k < n$, and the induction hypothesis gives $\sum_{k<n} c_{\tau(k)} = \sum_{k<n} c'_{\tau(k)} \le \sum_{k<Q} c'_k$. Splitting the sum $\sum_{k<Q}$ at $p$ and at $p+1$ shows $\sum_{k<Q} c'_k = \sum_{k<Q} c_k - c_p$, so adding $c_p$ to both sides gives $\sum_{k<n+1} c_{\tau(k)} \le \sum_{k<Q} c_k$. [L1, L2, L5, L6]

1.2 **Bounding index.** For every injective $\rho : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ and every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there is $Q \in \mathbb{N}$ with $\rho(k) < Q$ for all $k < n$: at $n = 0$ take $Q = 0$, and if $Q$ works for $n$ then the greater of $Q$ and $\rho(n)+1$ works for $n+1$, the order on $\mathbb{N}$ being total. [L5, L6]

1.3 Since $\sigma$ is a bijection, for every $j \in \mathbb{N}$ there is exactly one $k$ with $\sigma(k) = j$; write $\sigma^{-1}(j)$ for that $k$. Then $\sigma^{-1}$ is a bijection of $\mathbb{N}$, with $\sigma(\sigma^{-1}(j)) = j$ for every $j$. [L6, choose]

1.4 By [L7] both $\sum a_k^{+}$ and $\sum a_k^{-}$ converge; write $U$ and $V$ for their sums. Since $a_k = a_k^{+} - a_k^{-}$, linearity gives $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k = U - V$. [given, L7, L8]

1.5 The positive and negative parts are defined pointwise from the value of the term, so the positive part of $a_{\sigma(k)}$ is $a_{\sigma(k)}^{+}$ and its negative part is $a_{\sigma(k)}^{-}$; both are nonnegative sequences in the index $k$. [L7]

2.1 **The nonnegative case, one inequality.** Let $(c_k)$ be a sequence of nonnegative reals with $\sum c_k$ convergent of sum $M$, and let $\rho$ be a bijection of $\mathbb{N}$. For each $n$ pick $Q$ as in step 1.2; then $\rho$ restricted to $\{k : k<n\}$ is injective into $\{k : k<Q\}$, so $\sum_{k<n} c_{\rho(k)} \le \sum_{k<Q} c_k \le M$ by step 1.1 and [L3]. The terms $c_{\rho(k)}$ are nonnegative, so the partial sums of $\sum c_{\rho(k)}$ are bounded above by $M$; hence that series converges, and since each partial sum is at most $M$ its sum is at most $M$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L2, L3, L4]

3.1 **The nonnegative case, equality.** With $(c_k)$, $M$ and $\rho$ as in step 2.1, write $M'$ for the sum of $\sum c_{\rho(k)}$, so $M' \le M$. The sequence $(c_{\rho(k)})_k$ is nonnegative with convergent series of sum $M'$, and its rearrangement along the bijection $\rho^{-1}$ is $j \mapsto c_{\rho(\rho^{-1}(j))} = c_j$; so step 2.1, applied to that sequence and that bijection, gives $M \le M'$. Hence $M' = M$. [step 1.3, step 2.1]

4.1 Applying step 3.1 to the nonnegative sequence $(|a_k|)$, whose series converges by hypothesis, and to $\sigma$: the series $\sum |a_{\sigma(k)}|$ converges with the same sum as $\sum |a_k|$, which is claim 1. [given, step 3.1]

4.2 Applying step 3.1 to $(a_k^{+})$ and to $(a_k^{-})$, each with the bijection $\sigma$: the series $\sum a_{\sigma(k)}^{+}$ and $\sum a_{\sigma(k)}^{-}$ converge, with sums $U$ and $V$ respectively. [step 3.1, step 1.4, step 1.5]

5.1 Since $a_{\sigma(k)} = a_{\sigma(k)}^{+} - a_{\sigma(k)}^{-}$ for every $k$, linearity gives that $\sum a_{\sigma(k)}$ converges with sum $U - V$, which by step 1.4 equals $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k$; this is claim 2. [step 1.4, step 1.5, step 4.2, L8]

6.1 The same conclusion is available from claim 1 alone: $\sum |a_{\sigma(k)}|$ converges, so $\sum a_{\sigma(k)}$ converges; step 5.1 is what identifies its sum. [step 4.1, L9]

7.1 Claims 1 and 2 hold for an arbitrary bijection $\sigma$, so $\sum a_k$ converges and every rearrangement of it converges to the same sum, that is, $\sum a_k$ converges unconditionally. [step 4.1, step 5.1, L9, L10] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the nonnegative case is the whole theorem.** For nonnegative terms the sum is the supremum of the set of partial sums ([[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]]), and step 2.1 shows that each partial sum of a rearrangement is bounded by the original sum, and conversely. No cancellation can occur, so nothing depends on the order. Everything genuinely signed in the theorem is handled by [[lem-positive-and-negative-parts]], which splits the series into two nonnegative ones.

- **What step 1.1 is, and why it is proved rather than assumed.** It says that a finite sum of nonnegative terms taken along an injective list of indices is at most the sum over an initial segment containing all those indices. This is the one piece of finite combinatorics the theorem needs, and it is not among the laws of [[lem-finite-sum-laws]], all of which compare sums term by term over the same index range. The proof zeroes out one term at a time, which is what keeps it inside those laws.

- **The hypothesis cannot be weakened.** [[thm-riemann-series-theorem]] shows that for a conditionally convergent series every real number, and $\pm\infty$ besides, is the sum of some rearrangement; and [[cor-unconditional-iff-absolute-in-r]] turns the two theorems together into an exact characterisation.

## Statement

Let $(a_k)$ be a sequence of reals whose series converges conditionally
([[def-absolute-and-conditional-convergence]]). Let $\alpha, \beta \in
\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-extended-reals]]) with $\alpha \le \beta$. Then
there is a bijection $\sigma : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]) such that the partial sums
$T_n = \sum_{k<n} a_{\sigma(k)}$ of the rearranged series
([[def-rearrangement-and-unconditional-convergence]]) satisfy

$$\liminf_{n} T_n = \alpha, \qquad \limsup_{n} T_n = \beta$$

([[def-limsup-liminf]]). In particular:

1. for every $c \in \mathbb{R}$, taking $\alpha = \beta = c$, there is a
   rearrangement of $\sum a_k$ that converges with sum $c$;
2. taking $\alpha = \beta = +\infty$, there is a rearrangement whose partial sums
   diverge to $+\infty$ ([[def-divergence-to-infinity]]), and taking
   $\alpha = \beta = -\infty$, one whose partial sums diverge to $-\infty$;
3. taking $\alpha < \beta$, there is a rearrangement whose partial sums oscillate,
   with limit inferior exactly $\alpha$ and limit superior exactly $\beta$.

So the sum of a conditionally convergent series is an artefact of the order in
which its terms are written, and every prescribed asymptotic behaviour is
attainable. Contrast [[thm-dirichlet-rearrangement]], where absolute convergence
makes the sum independent of the order.

**The construction.** Write $P := \{k : a_k \ge 0\}$ and $N := \{k : a_k < 0\}$,
which partition $\mathbb{N}$, and enumerate each increasingly as $(p_i)$ and
$(q_l)$. Fix real sequences $(u_j)$ and $(v_j)$ with $u_j \le v_j$ and
$u_j \le v_{j+1}$ for every $j$; these are the *targets*. The rearrangement is
produced one index at a time by a greedy rule: **while the running sum is at most
the current upper target, take the next unused nonnegative term; once it exceeds
that target, take negative terms until the running sum falls below the current
lower target; then move to the next pair of targets and repeat.** Both supplies
are inexhaustible, because for a conditionally convergent series both
$\sum a_k^{+}$ and $\sum a_k^{-}$ diverge to $+\infty$
([[lem-positive-and-negative-parts]]); and the overshoot at each turning point is
at most the term just used, which tends to $0$ because $a_k \to 0$
([[lem-nth-term-test]]). Those two facts are the whole theorem.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(a_k)$ of reals with $\sum a_k$ convergent and $\sum |a_k|$ divergent; the positive and negative parts $a_k^{+}$, $a_k^{-}$; the sets $P = \{k : a_k \ge 0\}$ and $N = \{k : a_k < 0\}$; and extended reals $\alpha \le \beta$.

[A1] $P$ and $N$ are disjoint with union $\mathbb{N}$, since the order on $\mathbb{R}$ is total; $a_k^{+} = a_k$ and $a_k^{-} = 0$ for $k \in P$, while $a_k^{+} = 0$ and $a_k^{-} = -a_k$ for $k \in N$ ([[lem-positive-and-negative-parts]]).

[L1] For a conditionally convergent series, the partial sums of $\sum a_k^{+}$ and of $\sum a_k^{-}$ both diverge to $+\infty$ ([[lem-positive-and-negative-parts]], [[def-divergence-to-infinity]]).

[L2] The terms of a convergent series tend to $0$ ([[lem-nth-term-test]]).

[L3] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L4] The recursion theorem: for a set $A$, an element $a \in A$ and a function $f : A \to A$ there is a unique $g : \mathbb{N} \to A$ with $g(0) = a$ and $g(n+1) = f(g(n))$ ([[thm-recursion]]).

[L5] The principle of induction on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]).

[L6] Finite sums: $\sum_{k<0} x_k = 0$, $\sum_{k<n+1}x_k = \sum_{k<n}x_k + x_n$, splitting at an intermediate index, and $\sum_{k<n} 0 = 0$ ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L7] Partial sums of a series and their recursion $s_{n+1} = s_n + a_n$ ([[def-series]]).

[L8] Limits preserve non-strict inequalities holding eventually ([[lem-limit-preserves-order]], [[def-real-limit]]).

[L9] A bijection is an injective surjection ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L10] $\limsup_n x_n = \inf\{\, \sup\{x_m : m \ge n\} : n \in \mathbb{N} \,\}$ and $\liminf_n x_n = \sup\{\, \inf\{x_m : m \ge n\} : n \in \mathbb{N}\,\}$, both taken in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[def-limsup-liminf]], [[def-extended-reals]]).

[L11] A sequence converges to a real $L$ exactly when its limit inferior and limit superior both equal $L$, and diverges to $\pm\infty$ exactly when both equal $\pm\infty$ ([[thm-convergence-iff-limsup-equals-liminf]], [[def-extended-limits]]).

[L12] For nonnegative terms, a series diverges exactly when the range of its partial sums is unbounded above, and then those partial sums diverge to $+\infty$ ([[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 Since $\sum a_k$ converges, $a_k \to 0$. [given, L2]

1.2 For every $K \in \mathbb{N}$ there is $k \ge K$ with $k \in P$: otherwise $a_k < 0$ for every $k \ge K$, so $a_k^{+} = 0$ for every $k \ge K$, so the partial sums of $\sum a_k^{+}$ are constant from $K$ on and hence bounded, contradicting [L1]. The same argument with $a_k^{-}$ shows that for every $K$ there is $k \ge K$ with $k \in N$. [A1, L1, L6, L12]

2.1 In particular $P$ and $N$ are nonempty, and for every $k$ the sets $\{m \in P : m > k\}$ and $\{m \in N : m > k\}$ are nonempty; so by [L3] each has a least element. [step 1.2, L3]

3.1 Define $p : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ by $p_0 := \min P$ and $p_{i+1} := \min\{m \in P : m > p_i\}$, and $q : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ by $q_0 := \min N$ and $q_{l+1} := \min\{m \in N : m > q_l\}$; both are legitimate applications of the recursion theorem, the "next element" operations being total functions $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ by step 2.1. Both $p$ and $q$ take values in $P$, respectively $N$, and are strictly increasing. [step 2.1, L3, L4, construct]

4.1 An induction gives $p_i \ge i$ and $q_l \ge l$ for every index, since $p_0 \ge 0$ and $p_{i+1} > p_i \ge i$ forces $p_{i+1} \ge i+1$. [step 3.1, L5]

4.2 An induction on $i$ gives $P \cap \{k : k < p_i\} = \{p_{i'} : i' < i\}$: at $i = 0$ both sides are empty because $p_0$ is the least element of $P$; and passing from $i$ to $i+1$ adds exactly $p_i$, since $p_{i+1}$ is the least element of $P$ strictly greater than $p_i$, so no element of $P$ lies strictly between them. The same holds for $q$ and $N$. [step 3.1, L5]

4.3 Fix real sequences $(u_j)$ and $(v_j)$ with $u_j \le v_j$ and $u_j \le v_{j+1}$ for every $j$. Put $A := \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R} \times \{0,1\}$, whose elements are written $(i, l, j, s, m)$, and define $\mathrm{out} : A \to \mathbb{N}$ and $f : A \to A$ by: if $m = 0$ and $s \le v_j$, then $\mathrm{out} := p_i$ and $f := (i+1, l, j, s + a_{p_i}, 0)$; if $m = 0$ and $s > v_j$, then $\mathrm{out} := q_l$ and $f := (i, l+1, j, s + a_{q_l}, 1)$; if $m = 1$ and $s \ge u_j$, then $\mathrm{out} := q_l$ and $f := (i, l+1, j, s + a_{q_l}, 1)$; if $m = 1$ and $s < u_j$, then $\mathrm{out} := p_i$ and $f := (i+1, l, j+1, s + a_{p_i}, 0)$. The four cases are exhaustive and mutually exclusive, the order on $\mathbb{R}$ being total, so $f$ and $\mathrm{out}$ are functions. [step 3.1, construct]

5.1 Every element of $P$ is some $p_i$, and every element of $N$ is some $q_l$: given $k \in P$, the set $\{i : p_i > k\}$ is nonempty by step 4.1, so it has a least element $i_0$; $i_0 \ne 0$ since $p_0 = \min P \le k$, and $p_{i_0 - 1} \le k < p_{i_0}$, so $k \in P \cap \{m : m < p_{i_0}\} = \{p_{i'} : i' < i_0\}$ by step 4.2. Together with step 3.1 this says that $p$ is a bijection onto $P$ and $q$ a bijection onto $N$; both are injective because they are strictly increasing. [step 3.1, step 4.1, step 4.2, L3, L9]

5.2 An induction on $i$ gives $\sum_{i' < i} a_{p_{i'}} = \sum_{k < p_i} a_k^{+}$: at $i = 0$ every $k < p_0$ lies in $N$, so $a_k^{+} = 0$ and both sides are $0$; and splitting $\sum_{k<p_{i+1}} a_k^{+}$ at $p_i$ and at $p_i + 1$ isolates the single term $a_{p_i}^{+} = a_{p_i}$, all remaining indices $k$ with $p_i < k < p_{i+1}$ lying in $N$ by step 4.2 and contributing $0$. The same argument gives $\sum_{l' < l} a_{q_{l'}} = -\sum_{k<q_l} a_k^{-}$. [A1, step 3.1, step 4.2, L5, L6]

5.3 By the recursion theorem let $g : \mathbb{N} \to A$ satisfy $g(0) = (0,0,0,0,0)$ and $g(n+1) = f(g(n))$, write $g(n) = (i_n, l_n, j_n, s_n, m_n)$, and define $\sigma(n) := \mathrm{out}(g(n))$. [step 4.3, L4, construct]

5.4 For general $\alpha \le \beta$ choose real sequences with $u_j \le v_j$ and $u_j \le v_{j+1}$ as follows: if $\alpha, \beta$ are real, $u_j := \alpha$ and $v_j := \beta$; if $\alpha = -\infty$ and $\beta$ is real, $u_j := \beta - (j+1)$ and $v_j := \beta$; if $\alpha$ is real and $\beta = +\infty$, $u_j := \alpha$ and $v_j := \alpha + (j+1)$; if $\alpha = \beta = +\infty$, $u_j := j$ and $v_j := j+1$; if $\alpha = \beta = -\infty$, $u_j := -(j+2)$ and $v_j := -(j+1)$; and if $\alpha = -\infty$, $\beta = +\infty$, $u_j := -(j+1)$ and $v_j := j+1$. In every case $(u_j)$ tends to $\alpha$ and $(v_j)$ to $\beta$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, and both conditions of step 4.3 hold. [step 4.3, L11, choose]

6.1 Hence $\sum_{i'<i} a_{p_{i'}} \to +\infty$ as $i \to \infty$ and $\sum_{l'<l} a_{q_{l'}} \to -\infty$ as $l \to \infty$: the left-hand sides are the values of the partial sums of $\sum a_k^{+}$, respectively of $-\sum a_k^{-}$, at the strictly increasing indices $p_i$, respectively $q_l$, and by step 4.1 those indices are at least $i$, respectively $l$. [step 4.1, step 5.2, L1]

6.2 An induction on $n$ gives $i_n + l_n = n$ and $s_n = \sum_{k<n} a_{\sigma(k)}$: both hold at $n = 0$, and each transition increases exactly one of $i, l$ by one and adds to $s$ exactly the term $a_{\sigma(n)}$ indexed by the emitted natural. So $s_n = T_n$, the $n$-th partial sum of the rearranged series. [step 4.3, step 5.3, L5, L7]

7.1 Consequently, for every $i_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ and every real $M$ there is $i > i_0$ with $\sum_{i'=i_0}^{i-1} a_{p_{i'}} > M$, and for every $l_0$ and every real $M$ there is $l > l_0$ with $\sum_{l' = l_0}^{l-1} a_{q_{l'}} < M$; this is step 6.1 together with splitting of finite sums, the omitted initial block being a fixed real. [step 6.1, L6]

7.2 An induction on $n$ gives that $\sigma(n) = p_{i_n}$ at every step that increments $i$, and $\sigma(n) = q_{l_n}$ at every step that increments $l$; since $(i_n)$ and $(l_n)$ are nondecreasing and increase by one exactly at those steps, distinct steps of the first kind carry distinct values of $i_n$ and distinct steps of the second kind distinct values of $l_n$. As $p$ and $q$ are injective with disjoint ranges $P$ and $N$, the map $\sigma$ is injective. [step 4.3, step 6.2, step 5.1, L5]

8.1 There are infinitely many steps of each kind: if from some step $n_0$ on no step increments $l$, then $m_n$ is eventually constantly $0$, because a step with $m = 1$ that does not increment $l$ sets $m$ to $0$ and a step with $m = 0$ that does not increment $l$ leaves $m$ at $0$; then $j_n$ is eventually constant, say $j$, and every subsequent step satisfies $s_n \le v_{j}$, while by step 7.1 the values $s_n$, which from $n_0$ on increase by the successive terms $a_{p_i}$, exceed $v_j$ for some $n$. Symmetrically, if from some step on no step increments $i$, then $m_n$ is eventually constantly $1$, $j_n$ is eventually constant $j$, every subsequent step satisfies $s_n \ge u_j$, and step 7.1 makes $s_n$ fall below $u_j$. [step 7.1, step 4.3, step 6.2, L5]

9.1 Hence $i_n \to \infty$ and $l_n \to \infty$, so every $p_i$ and every $q_l$ occurs as some $\sigma(n)$; since $P \cup N = \mathbb{N}$ and $p, q$ enumerate $P$ and $N$, the map $\sigma$ is surjective, and with step 7.2 it is a bijection of $\mathbb{N}$. [A1, step 5.1, step 7.2, step 8.1, L9]

9.2 Likewise $j_n \to \infty$: if $j_n$ were eventually constant $j$, then from some step on no round is completed, so no step has $m = 1$ and $s < u_j$; by the argument of step 8.1 the mode is then eventually constant, and either it is $0$ forever, whence $s_n \le v_j$ always while $s_n$ increases past $v_j$, or it is $1$ forever, whence $s_n \ge u_j$ always while $s_n$ falls below $u_j$. [step 7.1, step 4.3, step 8.1]

10.1 For each $j \ge 1$ let $\beta_j$ be the step at which the mode of round $j$ changes from $0$ to $1$, that is the unique $n$ with $j_n = j$, $m_n = 0$ and $s_n > v_j$, and let $\alpha_j$ be the step at which round $j$ is completed, the unique $n$ with $j_n = j$, $m_n = 1$ and $s_n < u_j$; both exist by step 8.1 and step 9.2, and $\alpha_{j-1} < \beta_j < \alpha_j$. [step 4.3, step 8.1, step 9.2, choose]

11.1 The step $\beta_j$ is preceded, within round $j$, either by a step that added a term $a_{p_i} \ge 0$ to a value $s \le v_j$, or by the completing step $\alpha_{j-1}$ of the previous round, which added a term $a_{p_i} \ge 0$ to a value $s < u_{j-1} \le v_j$. In both situations $v_j < T_{\beta_j} \le v_j + a_{p_i}$ for the index $i$ used at the immediately preceding step. [step 4.3, step 10.1]

11.2 Likewise the step $\alpha_j$ is preceded within round $j$ by a step that added a term $a_{q_l} < 0$ to a value $s \ge u_j$, that step being either an earlier descent step or the switch $\beta_j$ itself, at which $s > v_j \ge u_j$; so $u_j - |a_{q_l}| \le T_{\alpha_j} < u_j$ for the index $l$ used at that step. [step 4.3, step 10.1]

11.3 For $\alpha_{j-1} \le n \le \beta_j$ the partial sums increase, every step of the climb adding a term $a_{p_i} \ge 0$; for $\beta_j \le n \le \alpha_j$ they decrease, every step of the descent adding a term $a_{q_l} < 0$. Hence for every $n$ with $\alpha_{j-1} \le n \le \alpha_j$ one has $\min\{T_{\alpha_{j-1}}, T_{\alpha_j}\} \le T_n \le T_{\beta_j}$. [A1, step 4.3, step 10.1]

12.1 Put $\delta_j := \max\{a_{p_{i(j)}},\, |a_{q_{l(j)}}|\}$ for the two indices appearing in step 11.1 and step 11.2. As $j \to \infty$ those indices tend to infinity, by step 8.1 and step 9.2, so $p_{i(j)} \to \infty$ and $q_{l(j)} \to \infty$ by step 4.1, and $\delta_j \to 0$ by step 1.1. Thus $v_j < T_{\beta_j} \le v_j + \delta_j$ and $u_j - \delta_j \le T_{\alpha_j} < u_j$ for every $j \ge 1$. [step 1.1, step 4.1, step 8.1, step 9.2, step 11.1, step 11.2]

12.2 Fix $n$ and let $J$ be least with $\alpha_{J-1} \ge n$, which exists because the $\alpha_j$ are strictly increasing. By step 11.3 every $m \ge \alpha_{J-1}$ satisfies $T_m \le \sup\{T_{\beta_j} : j \ge J\}$, and only the finitely many indices $m$ with $n \le m < \alpha_{J-1}$ are unaccounted for; each of those lies in a round of index at most $J-1$ and so is at most $\max\{T_{\beta_j} : 1 \le j \le J-1\}$ together with $T_n$ itself. Hence $\sup\{T_m : m \ge n\}$ is finite or $+\infty$ according as $\sup\{T_{\beta_j} : j \ge J\}$ is, and taking the infimum over $n$, which drives $J$ to infinity, gives $\limsup_n T_n = \limsup_j T_{\beta_j}$. [step 10.1, step 11.3, L10]

13.1 Take $u_j = v_j = c$ for all $j$, which satisfies the two conditions of step 4.3. Then $c < T_{\beta_j} \le c + \delta_j$ and $c - \delta_j \le T_{\alpha_j} < c$, so by step 11.3 every $n$ with $\alpha_{j-1} \le n \le \alpha_j$ has $|T_n - c| \le \max\{\delta_{j-1}, \delta_j\}$. Given a real $\varepsilon > 0$, choose $J \ge 2$ with $\delta_j < \varepsilon$ for all $j \ge J-1$; then $|T_n - c| < \varepsilon$ for all $n \ge \alpha_{J-1}$, so $T_n \to c$ and the rearranged series converges with sum $c$. This is claim 1. [step 12.1, step 11.3, L8]

13.2 Take $v_j = j+1$ and $u_j = j$, which satisfy the two conditions. Then $T_{\alpha_j} \ge u_j - \delta_j = j - \delta_j$, so by step 11.3 every $n$ with $\alpha_{j-1} \le n \le \alpha_j$ has $T_n \ge \min\{j-1-\delta_{j-1},\, j - \delta_j\}$, a quantity that exceeds any prescribed real for all large $j$; hence $T_n \to +\infty$. Taking instead $v_j = -(j+1)$ and $u_j = -(j+2)$, which also satisfy the two conditions, gives $T_n \le T_{\beta_j} \le v_j + \delta_j = -(j+1) + \delta_j$ on the same ranges, hence $T_n \to -\infty$. This is claim 2. [step 12.1, step 11.3, L8]

13.3 By step 12.1 the subsequence $(T_{\beta_j})_{j \ge 1}$ tends to $\beta$ and $(T_{\alpha_j})_{j\ge1}$ tends to $\alpha$, in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$: when the target sequence is real-valued and convergent the two-sided bound of step 12.1 with $\delta_j \to 0$ gives it, and when the target sequence diverges the one-sided bound does. [step 12.1, step 5.4, L8, L11]

14.1 By step 13.3 and [L11], $\limsup_j T_{\beta_j} = \beta$; so $\limsup_n T_n = \beta$. The same argument applied to infima, with $\alpha_j$ in place of $\beta_j$ and the lower bound of step 11.3 in place of the upper one, gives $\liminf_n T_n = \liminf_j T_{\alpha_j} = \alpha$. [step 13.3, step 12.2, L10, L11]

15.1 The bijection $\sigma$ of step 5.3, built from the targets chosen in step 5.4, is therefore a rearrangement of $\sum a_k$ whose partial sums have limit inferior $\alpha$ and limit superior $\beta$; claims 1 and 2 are the special cases computed directly in step 13.1 and step 13.2, and claim 3 is the case $\alpha < \beta$. [step 9.1, step 13.1, step 13.2, step 14.1, discharge-construct] ∎

## Remarks

- **Only two properties of the series are used.** That both part series diverge to $+\infty$ ([[lem-positive-and-negative-parts]]), which is what keeps the two supplies inexhaustible, and that $a_k \to 0$ ([[lem-nth-term-test]]), which is what makes the overshoot at each turning point vanish. Both hold for every conditionally convergent series and neither holds for an absolutely convergent one, whose part series both converge.

- **Where the well-ordering principle is used, and where it is not.** It appears in step 2.1 and step 3.1, to define the increasing enumerations of $P$ and $N$, and in step 5.1. It does *not* appear in the greedy rule: "take terms until the running sum crosses the target" is implemented as a one-step recursion whose state carries the two counters, the round and the running sum, so no least crossing index is ever selected. No choice principle is used anywhere; every object is determined by the data.

- **Zero terms are not a special case.** They are collected into $P$, so a run of zeros is consumed during a climb without moving the running sum, and the climb still terminates because the tail sums of $\sum_i a_{p_i}$ are unbounded. Had $P$ been defined as $\{k : a_k > 0\}$, the zero-indexed terms would have had to be inserted separately for $\sigma$ to be surjective.

- **The oscillating case is genuinely more than the two divergences.** With $\alpha < \beta$ both finite, the partial sums visit every neighbourhood of $\alpha$ and of $\beta$ infinitely often and are eventually confined to a neighbourhood of $[\alpha, \beta]$; the subsequential limit set of $(T_n)$ is then the whole interval, though nothing on this page needs that refinement.
