You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as a
read-only adversarial proof-refuter for the published-page audit. You are
tool-less: you cannot open a file, run a command, browse, edit, or delegate.
Everything you may rely on is reproduced in the `This dispatch` section. Return
evidence only; Audit-Alpha alone adjudicates and edits.

## Triage — the standing rule (verbatim, binding on you)

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct
  citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

## Adversarial standard

Read the target's title, Statement/Definition/Example/Statement refuted, Facts &
Assumptions, every numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks.
Try to falsify the public claim and every load-bearing inference.

1. Compare every cited fact with the supplied source text before alleging that
   it is weak. Check domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, direction, conclusion,
   and whether the source licenses the exact use.
2. Check that the title and public statement assert no more than the proof
   establishes, and that every proof step uses only available premises.
3. Check both directions of biconditionals, uniqueness/existence claims,
   induction and limiting arguments, empty/zero/endpoint/degenerate cases,
   extended-real conventions, index shifts, and hidden division or choice.
4. Re-read Remarks as skeptically as a numbered step. A false mathematical
   remark is a defect even when the proof is sound.
5. When the target is marked `ai-generated`, actively search for a
   counterexample to its claim, witness, or refutation rather than merely
   checking prose consistency.
6. Treat a false public claim, logically invalid proof, missing necessary
   hypothesis, circularity, or materially inaccurate load-bearing citation as
   fatal. Do not inflate an expository omission or a gap closable within thirty
   seconds into a defect.

## Output format

Reply with exactly this structure and no preamble:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

If `DEFECTS`, give one block per finding:

```text
FINDING 1
  location: [exact title, section, fact label, or numbered step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [the exact mathematical assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, missing hypothesis, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]
```

Then always end with:

```text
BOUNDARY: [specific boundary/counterexample checks and their disposition]
SOURCES:  [confirm every supplied cited item used by the target was inspected]
CHECKED:  [confirm the title, public claim, every numbered step, and Remarks were read]
```

## Statement refuted

**Refuted claim:** if $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ are uniformly continuous on
$A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-uniform-continuity-real]]) then so is their
pointwise product $fg$.

The witness is the simplest possible one: $A := \mathbb{R}$ and
$f = g = \mathrm{id}$, the identity. The identity is uniformly continuous on
$\mathbb{R}$ — one may take $\delta := \varepsilon$ — and its product with
itself is $x \mapsto x^{2}$, which is not uniformly continuous on $\mathbb{R}$
([[cex-x-squared-is-not-uniformly-continuous-on-r]]).

**The contrast with continuity is the point.** Products *do* preserve
continuity, with no hypothesis at all
([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]]). The reason the proof there does not
transfer is visible in the estimate: bounding $|f(x)g(x) - f(x')g(x')|$ requires
a bound on the *values* of $f$ and $g$ near the two points, and for continuity
that bound is local, supplied afresh at each point, whereas uniform continuity
would need one bound valid on the whole domain. On an unbounded domain no such
bound need exist.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The domain $A := \mathbb{R}$, the identity $\mathrm{id} : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, $\mathrm{id}(x) = x$, and its square $x \mapsto x^{2}$ ([[def-integer-power]]).

[L1] Uniform continuity on $A$: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that all $x, x' \in A$ with $|x - x'| < \delta$ satisfy $|h(x) - h(x')| < \varepsilon$ ([[def-uniform-continuity-real]]).

[L2] $x \mapsto x^{2}$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R}$ and is **not** uniformly continuous on $\mathbb{R}$ ([[cex-x-squared-is-not-uniformly-continuous-on-r]], [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L3] The pointwise product of $\mathrm{id}$ with itself is $x \mapsto x \cdot x = x^{2}$, and products of continuous functions are continuous ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L4] Absolute value and order: $|u| \ge 0$ and $|u| = 0$ exactly when $u = 0$; the order is total ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 The identity is uniformly continuous on $\mathbb{R}$: given a real $\varepsilon > 0$, take $\delta := \varepsilon$; then all $x, x' \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x - x'| < \delta$ satisfy $|\mathrm{id}(x) - \mathrm{id}(x')| = |x - x'| < \varepsilon$. [L1, L4]

1.2 The pointwise product of the identity with itself is the function $x \mapsto x^{2}$. [L3]

1.3 By [L2] the function $x \mapsto x^{2}$ is not uniformly continuous on $\mathbb{R}$. [L2]

2.1 So $f := \mathrm{id}$ and $g := \mathrm{id}$ are uniformly continuous on $A = \mathbb{R}$ while $fg$ is not: the refuted claim is false. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the implication survives.** On a **bounded** domain the product of two uniformly continuous functions *is* uniformly continuous, because each factor is then bounded: a uniformly continuous function on a bounded set is bounded, and the estimate $|fg - f'g'| \le |f|\,|g - g'| + |g'|\,|f - f'|$ closes. Nothing on this page asserts that, and it is not used anywhere here; the witness above shows only that the unrestricted claim fails.

- **Sums and scalar multiples are safe.** If $f$ and $g$ are uniformly continuous on $A$ then so are $f + g$ and $\alpha f$, by the same $\varepsilon/2$ and $\varepsilon/|\alpha|$ arguments that work for continuity, with the $\delta$'s inherited uniformly. It is only the product, and the quotient, that need a bound on values.

- **A second witness on a bounded domain.** $x \mapsto 1/x$ is not uniformly continuous on $(0,1)$ ([[cex-one-over-x-is-not-uniformly-continuous-on-the-unit-interval]]) although the identity is; that failure is a quotient rather than a product, and it shows that boundedness of the domain does not rescue every algebraic operation.

## Statement refuted

**Refuted claim:** the function $f : (0,1) \to \mathbb{R}$, $f(x) := 1/x$, is
uniformly continuous on $(0,1)$ ([[def-uniform-continuity-real]],
[[def-interval]]).

$f$ is continuous on $(0,1)$ ([[def-continuity-real]]) and its domain is
bounded, so this is the sharpest simple instance of
[[fs-continuity-implies-uniform-continuity]]: neither continuity nor
boundedness of the domain implies uniform continuity, and what
[[thm-heine-cantor-r]] actually needs is compactness, which $(0,1)$ does not
have because it is not closed ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]]).

The refutation exhibits, for every $\delta > 0$, a pair of points of $(0,1)$
closer than $\delta$ whose $f$-values differ by exactly $1$. The pairs are

$$x_k := \frac{1}{k+2}, \qquad y_k := \frac{1}{k+3} \qquad (k \in \mathbb{N}),$$

and the shift by $2$ and $3$ is not cosmetic: $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$ here
([[def-sequence]] is $0$-indexed), so $1/k$ is undefined at $k = 0$ and
$1/(k+1)$ leaves $(0,1)$ at $k = 0$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The interval $A := (0,1)$ and the function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$, $f(x) := 1/x$. Naturals are identified with their canonical images in $\mathbb{R}$.

[L1] Uniform continuity on $A$ fails as soon as some real $\varepsilon_0 > 0$ admits, for every real $\delta > 0$, a pair $x, x' \in A$ with $|x - x'| < \delta$ and $|f(x) - f(x')| \ge \varepsilon_0$ ([[def-uniform-continuity-real]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Algebra of continuous functions: the identity is continuous on $A$, and the reciprocal of a continuous nowhere-vanishing function is continuous ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], [[def-continuity-real]]).

[L3] Archimedean property in reciprocal form: for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $m \ge 1$ with $1/m < \eta$; and $0 < s < t$ implies $0 < 1/t < 1/s$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

[L4] Ordered-field arithmetic: for $k \in \mathbb{N}$ one has $k + 3 > k + 2 \ge 2 > 1 > 0$, so $0 < 1/(k+3) < 1/(k+2) < 1$ and both lie in $(0,1)$; and $(k+2)(k+3) \ge k+2 > 0$ ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-interval]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L5] $(0,1)$ is bounded but not closed, hence not compact, so [[thm-heine-cantor-r]] does not apply to it ([[def-bounded-set]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]]).

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $f$ is continuous on $A = (0,1)$: the identity is continuous there by [L2] and satisfies $x > 0 \ne 0$ for every $x \in A$, so its reciprocal is continuous on $A$ by [L2]. [L2, L4]

1.2 For $k \in \mathbb{N}$ put $x_k := 1/(k+2)$ and $y_k := 1/(k+3)$. By [L4] both lie in $A$, and $f(x_k) = k+2$, $f(y_k) = k+3$. At the first index, $k = 0$, this reads $x_0 = 1/2$ and $y_0 = 1/3$, both in $(0,1)$. [L4]

2.1 The separation of the arguments is $|x_k - y_k| = \dfrac{1}{k+2} - \dfrac{1}{k+3} = \dfrac{1}{(k+2)(k+3)} \le \dfrac{1}{k+2}$, using $(k+2)(k+3) \ge k+2 > 0$ and [L3]; the separation of the values is $|f(x_k) - f(y_k)| = |(k+2) - (k+3)| = 1$. [step 1.2, L3, L4]

3.1 Put $\varepsilon_0 := 1 > 0$ and let a real $\delta > 0$ be given. By [L3] fix a natural $m \ge 1$ with $1/m < \delta$, and take $k := m$. Then $k + 2 > m > 0$, so $1/(k+2) < 1/m < \delta$ by [L3], and step 2.1 gives $|x_k - y_k| \le 1/(k+2) < \delta$ while $|f(x_k) - f(y_k)| = 1 \ge \varepsilon_0$. [step 2.1, L3, choose]

4.1 So no real $\delta > 0$ serves $\varepsilon_0 = 1$, and by [L1] the function $f$ is not uniformly continuous on $(0,1)$, although by step 1.1 it is continuous there: the refuted claim is false. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L1, L5] ∎

## Remarks

- **What this witnesses in the regularity hierarchy.** [[thm-metric-regularity-hierarchy]], transported to real functions by [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]], gives uniformly continuous $\Rightarrow$ continuous and asserts no converse. This item is the witness that the converse fails, and it is one of the two named in the remarks of [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]]; the other, [[ex-x-to-the-beta-separates-the-holder-classes]], separates the Hölder classes below it.

- **The failure is at the missing endpoint, and it is repaired by restoring it.** On $[a,1]$ with $0 < a < 1$ the same formula is uniformly continuous, by [[thm-heine-cantor-r]], since $[a,1]$ is closed and bounded. It is also repaired by an explicit estimate: on $[a,1]$ one has $|1/x - 1/x'| = |x - x'|/(xx') \le |x-x'|/a^{2}$, so $f$ is even Lipschitz there.

- **A second reading of the same fact.** By [[cor-continuous-extension-from-a-dense-subset-r]], a uniformly continuous function on $(0,1)$ would extend continuously to $[0,1]$ and hence be bounded there ([[cor-boundedness-theorem-r]]); $1/x$ is unbounded on $(0,1)$, so it cannot be uniformly continuous. That route is shorter but rests on more, and the computation above is the elementary one.

## Statement refuted

**Refuted claim:** the function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$,
$f(x) := x^{2}$ ([[def-integer-power]]), is uniformly continuous on
$\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-uniform-continuity-real]]).

$f$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-continuity-real]]) and $\mathbb{R}$ is
a **closed** subset of itself, so this is the complement of
[[cex-one-over-x-is-not-uniformly-continuous-on-the-unit-interval]]: there the
domain was bounded and not closed, here it is closed and not bounded, and
uniform continuity fails in both cases. Neither half of compactness suffices on
its own, and [[thm-heine-cantor-r]] needs both
([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]]).

The refutation exhibits, for every $\delta > 0$, a pair of reals closer than
$\delta$ whose squares differ by more than $2$. The pairs are

$$a_k := k+1, \qquad b_k := k + 1 + \frac{1}{k+1} \qquad (k \in \mathbb{N}),$$

and the shift by $1$ is not cosmetic: $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$ here
([[def-sequence]] is $0$-indexed), so the reciprocal $1/k$ would be undefined at
the first index.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, $f(x) := x^{2}$. Naturals are identified with their canonical images in $\mathbb{R}$.

[L1] Uniform continuity on $\mathbb{R}$ fails as soon as some real $\varepsilon_0 > 0$ admits, for every real $\delta > 0$, a pair $x, x' \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x - x'| < \delta$ and $|f(x) - f(x')| \ge \varepsilon_0$ ([[def-uniform-continuity-real]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Polynomial functions are continuous on $\mathbb{R}$; in particular so is $x \mapsto x^{2}$ ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]], [[def-continuity-real]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L3] Archimedean property in reciprocal form: for every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $m \ge 1$ with $1/m < \eta$; and $0 < s < t$ implies $0 < 1/t < 1/s$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[thm-of-archimedean]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]).

[L4] Ordered-field arithmetic: for $k \in \mathbb{N}$ one has $k + 1 \ge 1 > 0$, so $1/(k+1)$ is defined and positive; the identity $v^{2} - u^{2} = (v-u)(v+u)$; and $|u| \ge 0$ with $|u| = u$ for $u \ge 0$ ([[def-ordered-field]], [[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-integer-power]]).

[L5] $\mathbb{R}$ is closed in itself but not bounded, hence not compact, so [[thm-heine-cantor-r]] does not apply to it ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-bounded-set]], [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]]).

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $f$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R}$, being a polynomial function. [L2]

1.2 For $k \in \mathbb{N}$ put $a_k := k+1$ and $b_k := (k+1) + 1/(k+1)$, both defined because $k + 1 \ge 1 > 0$ by [L4]. At the first index, $k = 0$, this reads $a_0 = 1$ and $b_0 = 2$. [L4]

2.1 The separation of the arguments is $|a_k - b_k| = 1/(k+1)$. The separation of the values is, by [L4], $$|f(b_k) - f(a_k)| = |b_k - a_k|\,(b_k + a_k) = \frac{1}{k+1}\Bigl(2(k+1) + \frac{1}{k+1}\Bigr) = 2 + \frac{1}{(k+1)^{2}} > 2 .$$ [step 1.2, L4]

3.1 Put $\varepsilon_0 := 2 > 0$ and let a real $\delta > 0$ be given. By [L3] fix a natural $m \ge 1$ with $1/m < \delta$ and take $k := m$; then $k + 1 > m > 0$, so $|a_k - b_k| = 1/(k+1) < 1/m < \delta$ by [L3], while step 2.1 gives $|f(a_k) - f(b_k)| > 2 = \varepsilon_0$. [step 2.1, L3, choose]

4.1 So no real $\delta > 0$ serves $\varepsilon_0 = 2$, and by [L1] the function $f$ is not uniformly continuous on $\mathbb{R}$, although by step 1.1 it is continuous there: the refuted claim is false. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L1, L5] ∎

## Remarks

- **The mechanism is the growing slope, not a singularity.** The increment $b_k - a_k$ is chosen to be the reciprocal of the point, so the product $(b_k - a_k)(b_k + a_k)$ stays above $2$ however small the increment becomes. Nothing blows up: $f$ is a polynomial, bounded on every bounded set, and the failure is entirely about how far out one is allowed to look.

- **On every bounded interval it is uniformly continuous.** On $[-M,M]$ one has $|x^{2} - y^{2}| = |x-y|\,|x+y| \le 2M|x-y|$, so $f$ is Lipschitz there, hence uniformly continuous ([[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]], clause 6). That is also what [[thm-heine-cantor-r]] gives, since $[-M,M]$ is compact.

- **The consequence for products.** The identity is uniformly continuous on $\mathbb{R}$ and its square is not, so the product of two uniformly continuous functions need not be uniformly continuous; that is [[cex-product-of-uniformly-continuous-functions-need-not-be-uniformly-continuous]], which is this item read once more.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field with its order and
absolute value ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]), and
neighbourhoods are those of [[def-neighbourhood-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Then
$f$ is **continuous at $c$** when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

with $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ ranging over the **positive reals**. In the
language of neighbourhoods: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ with

$$f\bigl(A \cap N_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \;\subseteq\; N_{\varepsilon}\bigl(f(c)\bigr).$$

$f$ is **continuous on $A$** when it is continuous at every point of $A$.

**The point $c$ is required to lie in $A$, and the condition is unpunctured.**
Both differ from [[def-function-limit]], and deliberately. There the quantifier
runs over $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, which removes $x = c$; here $x = c$ is allowed,
and at $x = c$ the implication reads $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$, which is
automatic. So allowing $x = c$ costs nothing, and it is what lets the definition
be stated at every point of $A$, including the points where no limit exists.

**Three clauses, and all three are part of the definition.**

1. **At a limit point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is a limit point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]). Then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if the
   limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) \;=\; f(c)$$
   ([[def-function-limit]]). Indeed, for a given $\varepsilon > 0$ a $\delta$
   witnessing continuity witnesses the limit condition, because the limit
   condition quantifies over a subset of the points continuity quantifies over;
   and conversely a $\delta$ witnessing $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$ witnesses
   continuity, because the one point it omits, $x = c$, satisfies
   $|f(c) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ anyway.

2. **At an isolated point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is an isolated point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so that $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ for some real
   $\eta > 0$. Then **every** $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$: take
   $\delta := \eta$, so that the only $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ is $c$
   itself, and $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$.

3. **On a set.** Continuity on $A$ is continuity at each point of $A$, and
   nothing more. It is not a condition relating $f$ to points outside $A$.

Every point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$,
and never both ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so clauses 1 and 2 between them describe
continuity at every point of $A$.

**This is not the raw $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula of
[[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]].** That item records what goes
wrong when the *punctured* formula of [[def-function-limit]] is written down at
an arbitrary point of the domain: at an isolated point it is satisfied
vacuously by every real $L$ at once, so it defines nothing, and this library
therefore leaves $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ **undefined** at an isolated point.
Continuity at an isolated point is a different matter: the formula above is not
vacuous — it is a genuine condition on $f(c)$, satisfied because $f(c)$ is the
only value being compared with itself — and it names a single, well-defined
property. The limit is undefined there; the continuity is defined, and is
automatic. Clause 1 is the only place where the two notions meet, and it is
stated only where the limit exists as a notion.

**Where the distinction disappears.** If $A$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), then every $c \in A$ has some
$N_{\eta}(c) \subseteq A$, and a punctured neighbourhood is never empty
([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), so every point of $A$ is a limit point of $A$ and
clause 1 covers the whole of $A$. The same holds when $A$ is a nondegenerate
interval ([[def-interval]]). Isolated points are what force clause 2 to exist at
all, and they occur as soon as $A$ is allowed to be an arbitrary subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, as in $A = \{0\} \cup [1,2]$.

## Remarks

- **Continuity is local.** If $\eta > 0$ and $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agrees with
  $f$ on $A \cap N_{\eta}(c)$, then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if $g$
  is: any $\delta$ may be replaced by $\min\{\delta, \eta\}$, after which the
  condition only ever evaluates the two functions where they agree. So
  continuity at $c$ sees only an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of $c$, exactly
  as the limit does ([[lem-limit-is-local]]).

- **Continuity passes to subsets of the domain.** If $B \subseteq A$ and
  $c \in B$, then continuity of $f$ at $c$ gives continuity of the restriction
  $f|_B$ at $c$, with the same $\delta$: the condition on $f|_B$ quantifies over
  fewer points. The converse fails, and the standard witness is the indicator of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ restricted to $\mathbb{Q}$, which is constant and hence
  continuous, while the indicator itself is continuous nowhere
  ([[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]]).

- **The radius is a real number.** As in [[def-neighbourhood-r]], $\varepsilon$
  and $\delta$ range over the positive reals here. Restricting either quantifier
  to the positive rationals defines the same relation, by the passage recorded
  in [[def-function-limit]]: below every positive real lies a positive rational
  ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and a real $\delta$ may be shrunk to a rational
  one below it.

- **The word *continuous* is used for two things in this library, and they
  agree.** [[def-metric-continuity]] defines continuity of a map between metric
  spaces, and $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ carries the metric $d(x,y) = |x-y|$. The
  two notions coincide, and that is proved, not assumed:
  [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]] is the dictionary, and it is stated on
  this page precisely so that no later item has to guess.

## Definition

Let $a \in \mathbb{R}$, where $\mathbb{R}$ is the ambient ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]).

**Natural exponents.** By the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) applied to
the set $\mathbb{R}$, the starting element $1$ and the function
$f(x) = x \cdot a$, there is a unique function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$,
written $n \mapsto a^n$, with

$$a^0 = 1, \qquad a^{n+1} = a^n \cdot a \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Thus $a^1 = a$, $a^2 = a \cdot a$, and so on. Note that this is defined for
**every** $a$, including $a = 0$.

**Negative exponents.** If $a \ne 0$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, set

$$a^{-n} := (a^n)^{-1}.$$

**Why that is legitimate.** The right-hand side presupposes that $a^n$ is
invertible, that is, that $a^n \ne 0$. This is a proof obligation and not an
observation, and it is discharged by claim 2 of [[lem-power-laws]]: for $a \ne 0$
in a field, $a^n \ne 0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, proved there by induction on
$n$ from the fact that a field has no zero divisors ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]).
That lemma is a statement *about* the operation introduced here, so it depends on
this definition and is recorded in this item's `justified_by` rather than in its
`deps` (SCHEMA §3). Given $a^n \ne 0$, the value $(a^n)^{-1}$ is a single
well-determined element, because multiplicative inverses in a field are unique
([[lem-of-inverse-unique]]).

**Integer exponents.** Every integer $m$ ([[def-integers]]) is either
$\iota(n)$ or $-\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$, where $\iota$ is the
embedding $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]],
[[def-int-operations]]). This too is a citation and not a slogan: the order on
$\mathbb{Z}$ is total ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), so $m \ge 0$ or $m < 0$; the
image of $\iota$ is exactly the set of nonnegative integers, and each of them is
$\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]); and if $m < 0$ then
$-m > 0$, by compatibility of the order with addition ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]),
so $-m = \iota(n)$ and $m = -\iota(n)$, with $n$ unique because $\iota$ is
injective. The two clauses above therefore define $a^m$ for every
$m \in \mathbb{Z}$ whenever $a \ne 0$, and for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$ for
arbitrary $a$. The clauses are consistent where they overlap: the only overlap is
$m = 0$, where $-\iota(0) = \iota(0)$ and $(a^0)^{-1} = 1^{-1} = 1 = a^0$.

## Remarks

- **The convention $0^0 = 1$ is adopted here**, and it is not a matter of taste
  but of agreement with the recursion above: $a^0 = 1$ is the starting value for
  every $a$, exactly as the empty product is $1$ ([[def-finite-sum]]). This is
  the convention that makes the empty product, the binomial theorem, and
  polynomial notation $\sum_k c_k x^k$ work at $x = 0$ without an exception. The
  competing convention "$0^0$ undefined" belongs to contexts where $x^y$ is
  studied as a function of two *real* variables and one wants continuity, which
  is unavailable and irrelevant here: the exponent in $a^m$ is an integer, never
  a real.
- $0^n = 0$ for every $n \ge 1$, since $0^{n} = 0^{n-1} \cdot 0 = 0$, a product
  with a zero factor ([[lem-of-zero-mult]]); and
  $0^{-n}$ is not defined for $n \ge 1$, since $0$ has no inverse.
- The exponent is an integer and stays an integer. Rational exponents are a
  separate construction resting on the existence of roots
  ([[thm-nth-roots-exist]], [[def-rational-power]]), and real exponents do not
  exist in this library yet ([[rem-real-exponents-deferred]]).
- The laws $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$ are
  proved, not assumed, in [[lem-power-laws]]; the order behaviour of $a \mapsto a^n$
  is [[lem-power-monotone]].

## Definition

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ ([[def-field]]) together with a subset
$P \subseteq F$, the set of **positive** elements (the *positive cone*),
satisfying:

- **(O1) Trichotomy.** For each $x \in F$, exactly one of the following holds:
  $x \in P$, or $x = 0$, or $-x \in P$.
- **(O2) Closure.** If $x, y \in P$ then $x + y \in P$ and $x \cdot y \in P$.

We write $x > 0$ for $x \in P$ (read "$x$ is positive"), and define the order by

$$a < b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; b - a \in P, \qquad a \le b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; a < b \text{ or } a = b.$$

Thus $a > b$ means $b < a$, and $a \ge b$ means $b \le a$. An element $x$ with
$-x \in P$ (equivalently $x < 0$) is called **negative**.

## Remarks

- By trichotomy applied to $b - a$, for any $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$,
  $a = b$, $a > b$ holds; this makes $\le$ a total order.
- (O2) says the positives are closed under addition and multiplication: sums and
  products of positives are positive.
- The rationals ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and both constructions of the reals
  ([[thm-reals-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-dedekind-ordered-field]]) are ordered
  fields, so every fact proved here from (O1)-(O2) holds in each of them.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$. Then $f$ is
**uniformly continuous on $A$** when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x, x' \in A)\ \bigl[\ |x - x'| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - f(x')| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

with $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ ranging over the positive reals.

**The whole content is in the order of the quantifiers.** Written out,
continuity on $A$ ([[def-continuity-real]]) is

$$\forall \varepsilon\ \forall c \in A\ \exists \delta\ \forall x \in A ,$$

and uniform continuity is

$$\forall \varepsilon\ \exists \delta\ \forall x' \in A\ \forall x \in A .$$

Moving $\exists \delta$ to the left of the point quantifier is the entire
difference: for continuity the radius may shrink from point to point, for
uniform continuity one radius must serve the whole of $A$ at once. This is the
same distinction, for the same reason, that [[def-metric-uniform-continuity]]
draws for maps of metric spaces.

**Uniform continuity implies continuity.** Given $\varepsilon > 0$, take the
$\delta$ supplied by uniform continuity and, at a point $c \in A$, apply the
condition with $x' := c$: every $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ satisfies
$|f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$. So the same $\delta$ witnesses continuity at
every point of $A$ simultaneously. The converse fails, and the failure is not
marginal: [[fs-continuity-implies-uniform-continuity]] refutes it on this page,
and the companion page works two witnesses out in full.

**Uniform continuity is a property of the pair $(f, A)$, not of $f$ alone.** The
same formula may be uniformly continuous on one set and not on another:
$x \mapsto 1/x$ is uniformly continuous on $[1,\infty)$ and not on $(0,1)$, and
$x \mapsto x^{2}$ is uniformly continuous on every bounded interval and not on
$\mathbb{R}$. Restricting the domain therefore never destroys uniform
continuity, since the condition then quantifies over fewer pairs; enlarging it
may.

**The two points are unordered and may coincide.** Nothing above excludes
$x = x'$, at which the implication reads $|f(x) - f(x)| = 0 < \varepsilon$
([[lem-of-abs-value]]) and is automatic, and the condition is symmetric in the
two points because $|x - x'| = |x' - x|$.

## Remarks

- **A single $\delta$, and a picture.** For a uniformly continuous $f$ one may
  slide a rectangle of width $\delta$ and height $2\varepsilon$ along the graph
  and never have the graph leave it through the top or bottom. For a merely
  continuous $f$ the rectangle must be narrowed as one moves, and on
  $x \mapsto 1/x$ over $(0,1)$ it must be narrowed without limit.

- **Neighbourhood form.** The condition says
  $f\bigl(A \cap N_{\delta}(x')\bigr) \subseteq N_{\varepsilon}(f(x'))$ for
  every $x' \in A$, with one $\delta$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). That is
  continuity on $A$ with the radius independent of the centre.

- **On an interval this is the notion the extension theorem needs.** A
  uniformly continuous function on a set $D$ extends to one on the closure of
  $D$ ([[cor-continuous-extension-from-a-dense-subset-r]]); mere continuity does
  not suffice, since $x \mapsto 1/x$ on $(0,1)$ has no continuous extension to
  $[0,1]$ ([[def-interval]]).

- **The two standard witnesses, for orientation.** The converse fails in two
  independent ways, each worked out on the companion page:
  [[cex-one-over-x-is-not-uniformly-continuous-on-the-unit-interval]] on a
  bounded domain that is not closed, and
  [[cex-x-squared-is-not-uniformly-continuous-on-r]] on a closed domain that is
  not bounded. Both are named here for orientation only; nothing in this
  definition rests on them.

- **Lipschitz and Hölder conditions are stronger still, and are not redefined
  here.** They are [[def-lipschitz-holder-contraction]] instantiated at
  $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ with $d(x,y) = |x-y|$; the dictionary that makes that
  instantiation legitimate, and that transports the implications of
  [[thm-metric-regularity-hierarchy]] to real functions, is
  [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]], immediately below.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$, with
$|x|$ the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]). Then

$$|x| \ge 0; \quad |x| = 0 \iff x = 0; \quad -|x| \le x \le |x|; \quad |-x| = |x|; \quad |xy| = |x|\,|y|;$$

and, for every $c > 0$, one has $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and elements $x, y \in F$.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| = u$ if $u \ge 0$, and $|u| = -u$ if $u < 0$ ([[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Ordered-field order: trichotomy holds (for each $u$ exactly one of $u > 0$, $u = 0$, $u < 0$), $a < b$ means $b - a$ is positive, and sums and products of positives are positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Signs in products: $(-a)b = -(ab)$ and $(-a)(-b) = ab$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] Sign rules: a product of two elements of the same sign is positive, and a product of two elements of opposite sign is negative ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Case $x > 0$: by [L1] $|x| = x > 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; since $-x < 0$ we get $|-x| = -(-x) = x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -x < 0 < x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case pos, L1, L2, algebra]

1.2 Case $x = 0$: then $|x| = |0| = 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ holds with $|x| = 0$ and $x = 0$, while $|-x| = |0| = |x|$ and $-|x| = 0 \le 0 \le 0 = |x|$. [assume-case zero, L1]

1.3 Case $x < 0$: by [L1] $|x| = -x$, and [L2] gives $-x > 0$, so $|x| > 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; here $|-x| = -x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -(-x) = x \le x$ while $x < 0 < -x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case neg, L1, L2, algebra]

1.4 Case $x = 0$ or $y = 0$: then $xy = 0$, so $|xy| = 0$, and one of $|x|, |y|$ is $0$, whence $|x|\,|y| = 0 = |xy|$. [assume-case zerofactor, L1]

1.5 Case $x, y$ have the same sign (both positive or both negative): by [L4] $xy > 0$, so $|xy| = xy$, while $|x|\,|y| = xy$ by [L3] (for $x, y < 0$ this is $(-x)(-y) = xy$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case same, L1, L3, L4]

1.6 Case $x, y$ have opposite signs (one positive, one negative): by [L4] $xy < 0$, so $|xy| = -(xy)$, while $|x|\,|y| = -(xy)$ by [L3] (namely $x(-y)$ or $(-x)y$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case opposite, L1, L3, L4]

2.1 By trichotomy [L2] each $x$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.1-1.3, and in each we verified $|x| \ge 0$, that $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$, that $|-x| = |x|$, and that $-|x| \le x \le |x|$; hence all four hold for every $x$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, cases-exhaustive]

2.2 By trichotomy [L2] each pair $x, y$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.4-1.6, and in each $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$ for all $x, y$. [step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6, cases-exhaustive]

3.1 Let $c > 0$: if $|x| < c$ then $-c < -|x| \le x \le |x| < c$ by [step 2.1] and [L2], so $-c < x < c$; conversely if $-c < x < c$ then both $x < c$ and $-x < c$, and since $|x|$ equals $x$ or $-x$ by [L1], we get $|x| < c$, so $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$. [step 2.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$, let
$\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Suppose $f$ and $g$ are continuous at
$c$ ([[def-continuity-real]]). Then:

1. $f + g$, $\alpha f$ and $fg$ are continuous at $c$;
2. $|f|$, the function $x \mapsto |f(x)|$, is continuous at $c$;
3. $\max\{f,g\}$ and $\min\{f,g\}$, defined pointwise by
   $x \mapsto \max\{f(x), g(x)\}$ and $x \mapsto \min\{f(x), g(x)\}$
   ([[def-max-min]]), are continuous at $c$;
4. if $g(c) \ne 0$ then, writing $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$, the
   point $c$ lies in $A_0$ and the quotient
   $(f/g)|_{A_0} : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$, $x \mapsto f(x)/g(x)$, is continuous at
   $c$ as a function on $A_0$.

Moreover, with no hypothesis at all:

5. every constant function $A \to \mathbb{R}$ and the identity
   $\mathrm{id} : A \to \mathbb{R}$, $x \mapsto x$, are continuous on $A$; hence
   so is $x \mapsto x^{n}$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$
   ([[def-integer-power]]), and hence so is every **polynomial function**
   $x \mapsto a_0 + a_1 x + \dots + a_n x^{n}$ with real coefficients.

Consequently, if $f$ and $g$ are continuous **on** $A$ then so are $f+g$,
$\alpha f$, $fg$, $|f|$, $\max\{f,g\}$ and $\min\{f,g\}$, and
$(f/g)|_{A_0}$ is continuous on $A_0$.

**Claim 4 is stated on $A_0$ because $f/g$ is not defined where $g$ vanishes**,
and $g$ may well vanish at points of $A$ far from $c$. The hypothesis is
$g(c) \ne 0$, not "$g$ nowhere zero"; what it buys is that $c$ itself lies in
the smaller domain, which is what makes continuity there mean anything.

**Nothing here is proved through a sequence.** Claims 1 and 4 are read off from
[[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]], which is itself proved from $\varepsilon$
and $\delta$, and claims 2, 3 and 5 are proved directly below. So no choice
principle is used anywhere in this item.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, functions $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\alpha$, a point $c \in A$ at which $f$ and $g$ are continuous, and, for claim 4, the hypothesis $g(c) \ne 0$ together with $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$.

[L1] Continuity at $c$: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L2] A point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$, and never both; at an isolated point of its domain every function is continuous; at a limit point $c$ of $A$, continuity of $f$ at $c$ is exactly the statement that the limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and equals $f(c)$ ([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-function-limit]]).

[L3] Algebra of function limits at a limit point $c$ of $A$: if the limits of $f$ and $g$ at $c$ exist with values $L$ and $M$, then the limits of $f+g$, $\alpha f$ and $fg$ at $c$ exist with values $L+M$, $\alpha L$ and $LM$; and if $M \ne 0$ then $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$, and the limit of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$ exists and equals $L/M$ ([[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]]).

[L4] Sign preservation: if the limit of $g$ at a limit point $c$ of $A$ exists and is nonzero, then $c$ is a limit point of $A_0 = \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$ ([[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]]).

[L5] Reverse triangle inequality: $\bigl||u| - |v|\bigr| \le |u - v|$ ([[cor-of-reverse-triangle]]); and $|u| \ge 0$, $|u| = 0$ exactly when $u = 0$, $|uv| = |u||v|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L6] Maximum and minimum of a two-element set of reals exist ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]), and for all reals $u, v$ one has $\max\{u,v\} = \tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(u + v + |u-v|\bigr)$ and $\min\{u,v\} = \tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(u + v - |u-v|\bigr)$.

[L7] Ordered-field arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: trichotomy and totality of the order, the field identities, and $0 < 1$ so that $2 \ne 0$ and $t/2$ is defined ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]).

[L8] Integer powers: $a^{0} = 1$ and $a^{n+1} = a^{n} \cdot a$ ([[def-integer-power]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Justification of the identity in [L6].** Let $u, v \in \mathbb{R}$. By totality either $u \ge v$ or $v \ge u$. If $u \ge v$ then $u - v \ge 0$, so $|u-v| = u-v$ and $\tfrac{1}{2}(u+v+|u-v|) = \tfrac{1}{2}(2u) = u = \max\{u,v\}$, while $\tfrac{1}{2}(u+v-|u-v|) = v = \min\{u,v\}$. If $v \ge u$ the same computation with the roles exchanged applies, since $|u-v| = v-u$ there. [L5, L6, L7]

1.2 **The isolated case.** Suppose $c$ is an isolated point of $A$, say $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ with $\eta > 0$ real. Then every function on $A$ is continuous at $c$ by [L2], which gives claims 1, 2 and 3 at once. For claim 4, assume $g(c) \ne 0$; then $c \in A_0$, and $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A_0 \subseteq N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ with $c$ in the left-hand side, so $c$ is an isolated point of $A_0$ and every function on $A_0$, in particular $(f/g)|_{A_0}$, is continuous at $c$. [L2]

1.3 **Claim 2, at any point of $A$.** Let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given and let $\delta > 0$ be as in [L1] for $f$ and this $\varepsilon$. For $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ the reverse triangle inequality gives $\bigl||f(x)| - |f(c)|\bigr| \le |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$. So $|f|$ is continuous at $c$, and no case distinction was needed. [L1, L5]

1.4 **Claim 5, constants and the identity.** If $f$ is constant then $|f(x) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$ for every $x \in A$ and every real $\varepsilon > 0$, so any $\delta > 0$ serves. For the identity, given a real $\varepsilon > 0$ take $\delta := \varepsilon$: every $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ has $|\mathrm{id}(x) - \mathrm{id}(c)| = |x - c| < \varepsilon$. Both are continuous at every point of $A$. [L1, L5, L7]

1.5 **The limit-point case, claim 1.** Suppose $c$ is a limit point of $A$. By [L2] the limits of $f$ and of $g$ at $c$ exist and equal $f(c)$ and $g(c)$. By [L3] the limits of $f+g$, $\alpha f$ and $fg$ at $c$ exist and equal $f(c)+g(c)$, $\alpha f(c)$ and $f(c)g(c)$, which are exactly the values of those three functions at $c$; by [L2] again, each of them is continuous at $c$. [L2, L3]

1.6 **The limit-point case, claim 4.** Suppose $c$ is a limit point of $A$ and $g(c) \ne 0$. Then $c \in A_0$, and by [L4] the point $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$. By [L3] the limit of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$ exists and equals $f(c)/g(c)$, which is the value of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$; by [L2] applied on the domain $A_0$, that function is continuous at $c$. [L2, L3, L4]

2.1 **Claims 1 and 4 in general.** By [L2] the point $c$ is either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$; step 1.2 settles the first case and steps 1.5 and 1.6 the second. So claims 1 and 4 hold as stated. [step 1.2, step 1.5, step 1.6, L2]

3.1 **Claim 3.** By claim 1 the function $f - g = f + (-1)g$ is continuous at $c$, by step 1.3 so is $|f-g|$, and by claim 1 again so are $f + g + |f-g|$ and its scalar multiple by $1/2$. By step 1.1 that scalar multiple is the function $x \mapsto \max\{f(x), g(x)\}$, so the maximum is continuous at $c$; the same argument with $-|f-g|$ gives the minimum. [step 1.1, step 1.3, step 2.1, L6, L7]

3.2 **Claim 5, powers and polynomials.** The map $x \mapsto x^{0}$ is the constant $1$ and $x \mapsto x^{1}$ is the identity, both continuous on $A$ by step 1.4; and if $x \mapsto x^{n}$ is continuous on $A$ then so is $x \mapsto x^{n+1} = x^{n} \cdot x$, being a product of two functions continuous on $A$ by step 2.1. By induction on $n$, $x \mapsto x^{n}$ is continuous on $A$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. A polynomial function $a_0 + a_1x + \dots + a_nx^{n}$ is obtained from these by finitely many scalar multiplications and additions, each of which preserves continuity by step 2.1. [step 1.4, step 2.1, L8]

4.1 Claims 1 to 5 are proved, all of them at an arbitrary point $c$ of $A$ and therefore, applied at every point, on the whole of $A$; and no sequence and no choice principle was used. [step 1.3, step 2.1, step 3.1, step 3.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the two-case shape, and why it is not an inconvenience.** Continuity is defined at every point of the domain, including isolated points, where no limit exists ([[def-continuity-real]]). The algebra of limits therefore cannot be applied blindly; but at an isolated point every function is continuous, so the case is settled before it is opened. Claims 2 and 5 are proved directly from $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ and need no case distinction at all.

- **Absolute value, maximum and minimum are not in [[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]]**, and the reason is that they are not needed there. They are needed here: the extreme value theorem and the one-dimensional fixed point theorem both build auxiliary functions out of maxima, minima and differences, and [[thm-compactness-is-necessary-for-evt-and-uniform-continuity]] builds its witnesses out of $|x - x_0|$ and quotients.

- **The converse of claim 2 is false**: $|f|$ may be continuous while $f$ is continuous nowhere. The function equal to $1$ on $\mathbb{Q}$ and to $-1$ elsewhere has constant absolute value; that it is nowhere continuous follows from the argument of [[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]] applied verbatim, since that argument uses only that the two values are distinct.
