You are **DeepSeek V4 Pro** at the API's maximum reasoning setting, serving as a
read-only adversarial proof-refuter for the published-page audit. You are
tool-less: you cannot open a file, run a command, browse, edit, or delegate.
Everything you may rely on is reproduced in the `This dispatch` section. Return
evidence only; Audit-Alpha alone adjudicates and edits.

## Triage — the standing rule (verbatim, binding on you)

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct
  citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

## Adversarial standard

Read the target's title, Statement/Definition/Example/Statement refuted, Facts &
Assumptions, every numbered proof/refutation/verification step, and Remarks.
Try to falsify the public claim and every load-bearing inference.

1. Compare every cited fact with the supplied source text before alleging that
   it is weak. Check domain, quantifiers, hypotheses, direction, conclusion,
   and whether the source licenses the exact use.
2. Check that the title and public statement assert no more than the proof
   establishes, and that every proof step uses only available premises.
3. Check both directions of biconditionals, uniqueness/existence claims,
   induction and limiting arguments, empty/zero/endpoint/degenerate cases,
   extended-real conventions, index shifts, and hidden division or choice.
4. Re-read Remarks as skeptically as a numbered step. A false mathematical
   remark is a defect even when the proof is sound.
5. When the target is marked `ai-generated`, actively search for a
   counterexample to its claim, witness, or refutation rather than merely
   checking prose consistency.
6. Treat a false public claim, logically invalid proof, missing necessary
   hypothesis, circularity, or materially inaccurate load-bearing citation as
   fatal. Do not inflate an expository omission or a gap closable within thirty
   seconds into a defect.

## Output format

Reply with exactly this structure and no preamble:

```text
VERDICT: CLEAN | DEFECTS
```

If `DEFECTS`, give one block per finding:

```text
FINDING 1
  location: [exact title, section, fact label, or numbered step]
  severity: fatal | nonfatal
  claim:    [the exact mathematical assertion]
  evidence: [counterexample, missing hypothesis, invalid inference, or exact source mismatch]
```

Then always end with:

```text
BOUNDARY: [specific boundary/counterexample checks and their disposition]
SOURCES:  [confirm every supplied cited item used by the target was inspected]
CHECKED:  [confirm the title, public claim, every numbered step, and Remarks were read]

## Example

Let $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ be the indicator of the rationals
([[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]]) and put

$$h : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad h(x) := x \cdot \mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(x),$$

so $h(x) = x$ for rational $x$ and $h(x) = 0$ for irrational $x$. Then:

1. $h$ is **continuous at $0$** ([[def-continuity-real]]);
2. $h$ is **not continuous at any $c \ne 0$**.

So the set of points of continuity of a real function can be a single point.
Together with [[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]], where that set is empty,
this shows how little the set of continuity points is constrained by the mere
existence of the function.

**The point of the example.** Continuity at $c$ compares $h(x)$ with $h(c)$, and
the two branches of $h$ agree only where $x = 0$. Multiplying the indicator by
$x$ damps the jump: near $0$ both branches are small, so the discrepancy is at
most $|x|$; away from $0$ the discrepancy is at least $|c|/2$ on every
neighbourhood, because each branch is realised arbitrarily close to $c$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The canonical copy $\mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ of the rationals with complement $X := \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$, and $h : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ with $h(x) = x$ for $x \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $h(x) = 0$ for $x \in X$.

[L1] Continuity at $c$, in the form of [[def-continuity-real]]: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ with $|h(x) - h(c)| < \varepsilon$ whenever $|x - c| < \delta$; and it fails at $c$ as soon as some real $\varepsilon_0 > 0$ admits, for every real $\delta > 0$, a real $x$ with $|x-c| < \delta$ and $|h(x) - h(c)| \ge \varepsilon_0$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L2] Both $\mathbb{Q}$ and $X$ are dense in $\mathbb{R}$, so every $N_{\delta}(c)$ meets each of them ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]]).

[L3] $X$ is by definition the complement $\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$, so every real lies in exactly one of $\mathbb{Q}$ and $X$; hence $h$ is a well-defined function, and $|h(x)| \le |x|$ for every real $x$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]]).

[L4] Absolute value and order: $|u| \ge 0$ and $|u| > 0$ exactly when $u \ne 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]); the reverse triangle inequality $\bigl||u| - |v|\bigr| \le |u - v|$, hence $|u - v| \ge |u| - |v|$ ([[cor-of-reverse-triangle]]); and the minimum of a two-element set of reals exists and is one of the two ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Verification

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $h$ is well defined and satisfies $|h(x)| \le |x|$ for every real $x$: on $\mathbb{Q}$ one has $|h(x)| = |x|$ and on $X$ one has $|h(x)| = 0 \le |x|$. Also $0 \in \mathbb{Q}$, so $h(0) = 0$. [L3, L4]

1.2 **Claim 2, the setup.** Let $c \ne 0$ be real, put $\varepsilon_0 := |c|/2 > 0$ by [L4], and let a real $\delta > 0$ be given. Put $\delta' := \min\{\delta,\ |c|/2\} > 0$ by [L4]. [L4, choose]

2.1 **Claim 1.** Let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given and take $\delta := \varepsilon$. Every real $x$ with $|x - 0| < \delta$ satisfies $|h(x) - h(0)| = |h(x)| \le |x| < \varepsilon$ by step 1.1. So $h$ is continuous at $0$. [step 1.1, L1, L4]

2.2 By [L2] the neighbourhood $N_{\delta'}(c)$ meets $\mathbb{Q}$ and meets $X$: fix $p \in N_{\delta'}(c) \cap \mathbb{Q}$ and $z \in N_{\delta'}(c) \cap X$, so $|p - c| < \delta' \le \delta$ and $|z - c| < \delta' \le \delta$, with $h(p) = p$ and $h(z) = 0$. [step 1.2, L2, choose]

3.1 **The rational case.** Suppose $c \in \mathbb{Q}$, so $h(c) = c$. Take $x := z$: then $|x - c| < \delta$ and $|h(x) - h(c)| = |0 - c| = |c| \ge |c|/2 = \varepsilon_0$. [step 1.2, step 2.2, L3, L4]

3.2 **The irrational case.** Suppose $c \in X$, so $h(c) = 0$. Take $x := p$: then $|x - c| < \delta$, and $|p| \ge |c| - |p - c| > |c| - |c|/2 = |c|/2$ by [L4] and step 2.2, so $|h(x) - h(c)| = |p| > |c|/2 = \varepsilon_0$. [step 1.2, step 2.2, L3, L4]

4.1 By [L3] the two cases of steps 3.1 and 3.2 are exhaustive, so for every real $\delta > 0$ some $x$ with $|x-c| < \delta$ has $|h(x) - h(c)| \ge \varepsilon_0$; by [L1] the function $h$ is not continuous at $c$. Since $c \ne 0$ was arbitrary, claim 2 holds, and with step 2.1 the set of points of continuity of $h$ is exactly $\{0\}$. [step 2.1, step 3.1, step 3.2, L1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the damping factor does its work.** The estimate $|h(x)| \le |x|$ of step 1.1 is the whole of claim 1, and it is available only because the two branches of $h$ agree at $0$. Replacing $x$ by any function vanishing at $0$ and continuous there gives the same conclusion at $0$; replacing it by a nonzero constant gives [[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]] back.

- **The choice of $\delta' = \min\{\delta, |c|/2\}$ is what makes the irrational case work.** Without shrinking to $|c|/2$ the rational point $p$ near $c$ could be close to $0$, and then $|h(p) - h(c)| = |p|$ would be small; the shrinking keeps $p$ away from $0$ by at least $|c|/2$.

- **This example is choice free**, for the same reason as [[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]]: density is used only in the form "every neighbourhood meets the set", never to build a sequence.

## Statement refuted

**Refuted claim:** every function $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at
at least one point ([[def-continuity-real]]).

The witness is the **Dirichlet function**, the indicator of the rationals:
writing $\mathbb{Q}$ for the canonical copy of the rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$
([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]),

$$\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}} : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad \mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(x) := \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } x \in \mathbb{Q},\\ 0 & \text{if } x \notin \mathbb{Q}. \end{cases}$$

It is continuous at **no** point of $\mathbb{R}$. The mechanism is that both
$\mathbb{Q}$ and its complement are dense ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]),
so every neighbourhood of every real contains a point of each, and the two
values differ by $1$.

**The argument is choice free.** Density is used in the form "every
neighbourhood of every point meets the set", which is
[[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] applied to a closure equal to $\mathbb{R}$;
no sequence is built, so neither
[[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]] nor
[[thm-sequential-criterion-for-continuity]] is invoked, and the countable choice
those two spend is not spent here.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The canonical copy $\mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ of the rationals, its complement $X := \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$, and the function $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}} : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ taking the value $1$ on $\mathbb{Q}$ and $0$ on $X$.

[L1] Continuity at $c$: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ with $|\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(x) - \mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(c)| < \varepsilon$ for every real $x$ with $|x - c| < \delta$. So continuity at $c$ fails as soon as some real $\varepsilon_0 > 0$ admits, for every real $\delta > 0$, a real $x$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ and $|\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(x) - \mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(c)| \ge \varepsilon_0$ ([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L2] Both $\mathbb{Q}$ and $X$ are dense in $\mathbb{R}$, that is, each has closure $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]], [[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L3] A point lies in the closure of $S$ exactly when every neighbourhood $N_{\delta}$ of it meets $S$; so a set with closure $\mathbb{R}$ meets every $N_{\delta}(c)$, for every real $c$ and every real $\delta > 0$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L4] $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ is a well-defined function: $X$ is by definition the complement $\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$, so every real either lies in $\mathbb{Q}$ or does not, exclusively; and $|1 - 0| = |0 - 1| = 1$, with $1/2 > 0$ and $1/2 < 1$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Counterexample

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ is a well-defined function on $\mathbb{R}$ taking only the values $0$ and $1$, and $\mathbb{R}$ is the disjoint union of $\mathbb{Q}$ and $X$. [L4]

1.2 Let $c \in \mathbb{R}$ be arbitrary, put $\varepsilon_0 := 1/2 > 0$, and let a real $\delta > 0$ be given. [L4]

2.1 By [L2] and [L3] the neighbourhood $N_{\delta}(c)$ meets $\mathbb{Q}$ and it meets $X$: there are reals $p \in N_{\delta}(c) \cap \mathbb{Q}$ and $z \in N_{\delta}(c) \cap X$, so $|p - c| < \delta$ and $|z - c| < \delta$, with $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(p) = 1$ and $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(z) = 0$. [step 1.2, L2, L3, choose]

3.1 If $c \in \mathbb{Q}$ then $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(c) = 1$ and the point $x := z$ satisfies $|x - c| < \delta$ and $|\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(x) - \mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(c)| = |0 - 1| = 1 \ge \varepsilon_0$. If $c \notin \mathbb{Q}$ then $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(c) = 0$ and the point $x := p$ satisfies $|x - c| < \delta$ and $|\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(x) - \mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(c)| = |1 - 0| = 1 \ge \varepsilon_0$. By [L4] these two possibilities are exhaustive and exclusive. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L4]

4.1 So for the fixed $\varepsilon_0 = 1/2$ no real $\delta > 0$ serves at $c$, and by [L1] the function $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ is not continuous at $c$. As $c$ was an arbitrary real, it is continuous at no point of $\mathbb{R}$, and the refuted claim is false. [step 1.2, step 3.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why $\varepsilon_0 = 1/2$ and not $1$.** Any $\varepsilon_0 \le 1$ works, since the discrepancy produced is exactly $1$. Taking $1/2$ leaves the inequality strict and makes it visible that the failure is not a boundary effect.

- **Restricting the domain repairs it completely.** The restriction of $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ to $\mathbb{Q}$ is constantly $1$ and the restriction to the irrationals is constantly $0$; both are continuous. This is the standard warning that continuity is a property of the pair (function, domain), recorded in [[def-continuity-real]]: continuity passes to subsets of the domain, never up from them.

- **A near miss worth naming.** Multiplying by $x$ repairs continuity at exactly one point: $x \mapsto x\,\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(x)$ is continuous at $0$ and nowhere else, which is [[ex-x-times-dirichlet-is-continuous-exactly-at-zero]]. The same argument as above, applied to any function taking two distinct values densely, shows nowhere-continuity; in particular the function equal to $1$ on $\mathbb{Q}$ and $-1$ elsewhere is nowhere continuous while its absolute value is constant.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$. Then

$$\bigl| |x| - |y| \bigr| \le |x - y|.$$

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and elements $x, y \in F$.

[L1] Triangle inequality: $|a + b| \le |a| + |b|$ for all $a, b \in F$ ([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]).

[L2] For every $u \in F$, $|-u| = |u|$, and $|w|$ equals $w$ or $-w$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Applying [L1] with $a = x - y$ and $b = y$ gives $|x| = |(x - y) + y| \le |x - y| + |y|$, so $|x| - |y| \le |x - y|$. [L1]

1.2 Applying [L1] with $a = y - x$ and $b = x$, and using $|y - x| = |x - y|$ from [L2], gives $|y| \le |y - x| + |x| = |x - y| + |x|$, so $|y| - |x| \le |x - y|$. [L1, L2]

2.1 By [L2] the value $\bigl| |x| - |y| \bigr|$ equals $|x| - |y|$ or $-(|x| - |y|) = |y| - |x|$, and each of these is $\le |x - y|$ by steps 1.1 and 1.2, so $\bigl| |x| - |y| \bigr| \le |x - y|$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L2, algebra] ∎

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field with its order and
absolute value ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]), and
neighbourhoods are those of [[def-neighbourhood-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Then
$f$ is **continuous at $c$** when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

with $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ ranging over the **positive reals**. In the
language of neighbourhoods: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ with

$$f\bigl(A \cap N_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \;\subseteq\; N_{\varepsilon}\bigl(f(c)\bigr).$$

$f$ is **continuous on $A$** when it is continuous at every point of $A$.

**The point $c$ is required to lie in $A$, and the condition is unpunctured.**
Both differ from [[def-function-limit]], and deliberately. There the quantifier
runs over $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, which removes $x = c$; here $x = c$ is allowed,
and at $x = c$ the implication reads $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$, which is
automatic. So allowing $x = c$ costs nothing, and it is what lets the definition
be stated at every point of $A$, including the points where no limit exists.

**Three clauses, and all three are part of the definition.**

1. **At a limit point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is a limit point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]). Then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if the
   limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) \;=\; f(c)$$
   ([[def-function-limit]]). Indeed, for a given $\varepsilon > 0$ a $\delta$
   witnessing continuity witnesses the limit condition, because the limit
   condition quantifies over a subset of the points continuity quantifies over;
   and conversely a $\delta$ witnessing $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$ witnesses
   continuity, because the one point it omits, $x = c$, satisfies
   $|f(c) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ anyway.

2. **At an isolated point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is an isolated point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so that $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ for some real
   $\eta > 0$. Then **every** $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$: take
   $\delta := \eta$, so that the only $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ is $c$
   itself, and $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$.

3. **On a set.** Continuity on $A$ is continuity at each point of $A$, and
   nothing more. It is not a condition relating $f$ to points outside $A$.

Every point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$,
and never both ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so clauses 1 and 2 between them describe
continuity at every point of $A$.

**This is not the raw $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula of
[[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]].** That item records what goes
wrong when the *punctured* formula of [[def-function-limit]] is written down at
an arbitrary point of the domain: at an isolated point it is satisfied
vacuously by every real $L$ at once, so it defines nothing, and this library
therefore leaves $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ **undefined** at an isolated point.
Continuity at an isolated point is a different matter: the formula above is not
vacuous — it is a genuine condition on $f(c)$, satisfied because $f(c)$ is the
only value being compared with itself — and it names a single, well-defined
property. The limit is undefined there; the continuity is defined, and is
automatic. Clause 1 is the only place where the two notions meet, and it is
stated only where the limit exists as a notion.

**Where the distinction disappears.** If $A$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), then every $c \in A$ has some
$N_{\eta}(c) \subseteq A$, and a punctured neighbourhood is never empty
([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), so every point of $A$ is a limit point of $A$ and
clause 1 covers the whole of $A$. The same holds when $A$ is a nondegenerate
interval ([[def-interval]]). Isolated points are what force clause 2 to exist at
all, and they occur as soon as $A$ is allowed to be an arbitrary subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, as in $A = \{0\} \cup [1,2]$.

## Remarks

- **Continuity is local.** If $\eta > 0$ and $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agrees with
  $f$ on $A \cap N_{\eta}(c)$, then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if $g$
  is: any $\delta$ may be replaced by $\min\{\delta, \eta\}$, after which the
  condition only ever evaluates the two functions where they agree. So
  continuity at $c$ sees only an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of $c$, exactly
  as the limit does ([[lem-limit-is-local]]).

- **Continuity passes to subsets of the domain.** If $B \subseteq A$ and
  $c \in B$, then continuity of $f$ at $c$ gives continuity of the restriction
  $f|_B$ at $c$, with the same $\delta$: the condition on $f|_B$ quantifies over
  fewer points. The converse fails, and the standard witness is the indicator of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ restricted to $\mathbb{Q}$, which is constant and hence
  continuous, while the indicator itself is continuous nowhere
  ([[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]]).

- **The radius is a real number.** As in [[def-neighbourhood-r]], $\varepsilon$
  and $\delta$ range over the positive reals here. Restricting either quantifier
  to the positive rationals defines the same relation, by the passage recorded
  in [[def-function-limit]]: below every positive real lies a positive rational
  ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and a real $\delta$ may be shrunk to a rational
  one below it.

- **The word *continuous* is used for two things in this library, and they
  agree.** [[def-metric-continuity]] defines continuity of a map between metric
  spaces, and $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ carries the metric $d(x,y) = |x-y|$. The
  two notions coincide, and that is proved, not assumed:
  [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]] is the dictionary, and it is stated on
  this page precisely so that no later item has to guess.

## Definition

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $m \in \mathbb{R}$.

- $m$ is a **maximum** (or *greatest element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $s \le m$
  for every $s \in S$.
- $m$ is a **minimum** (or *least element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $m \le s$
  for every $s \in S$.

A set has at most one maximum: if $m_1$ and $m_2$ are both maxima then
$m_1 \in S$ gives $m_1 \le m_2$ and $m_2 \in S$ gives $m_2 \le m_1$, so
$m_1 = m_2$ by antisymmetry of the order, which is immediate from the trichotomy
axiom of an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).
The same argument applies to minima, so we may write $\max S$ and $\min S$.

## Remarks

- A maximum is precisely an upper bound of $S$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]])
  that happens to lie in $S$; a minimum is a lower bound of $S$
  ([[def-bounded-set]]) that lies in $S$. In particular a set with a maximum is
  bounded above and a set with a minimum is bounded below.
- The empty set has neither a maximum nor a minimum, because the requirement
  $m \in S$ cannot be met.
- The membership requirement $m \in S$ is exactly what separates a maximum from a
  supremum, and it is the theme of this page. A supremum is a bound on the set
  and is not asked to belong to it; a maximum is an element of the set. The two
  agree exactly when the supremum happens to be attained ([[lem-max-is-sup]]),
  and they genuinely differ in general ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has both a maximum and a minimum
  ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]), which is what licenses the notation
  $\max\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$. Infinite sets need not: the failure of attainment is
  an infinitary phenomenon.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]) and its absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]).

Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ with
$\varepsilon > 0$. The **$\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\},$$

and the **punctured $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \;=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}.$$

The two descriptions of $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ agree because $|y - x| = 0$ holds
exactly when $y = x$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**A neighbourhood is an open interval.** For every $x$ and every
$\varepsilon > 0$,

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;=\; (x - \varepsilon,\ x + \varepsilon),$$

the interval of [[def-interval]]. Indeed [[lem-of-abs-value]] gives, for
$\varepsilon > 0$, the equivalence $|y - x| < \varepsilon \iff -\varepsilon <
y - x < \varepsilon$, and adding $x$ throughout turns the right-hand side into
$x - \varepsilon < y < x + \varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**The centre lies in its own neighbourhoods.** $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, since
$|x - x| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**Punctured neighbourhoods are never empty.** The element
$y := x + \varepsilon/2$ satisfies $|y - x| = \varepsilon/2$, which is
$> 0$ and $< \varepsilon$, so $y \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$
([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

**Monotonicity in the radius.** If $0 < \delta \le \varepsilon$ then
$N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, because $|y - x| < \delta \le
\varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**Nesting at an interior point.** If $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and
$0 < \delta \le \varepsilon - |y - x|$, then

$$N_\delta(y) \;\subseteq\; N_\varepsilon(x).$$

Indeed for $z \in N_\delta(y)$ the triangle inequality
([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]) gives
$|z - x| = |(z - y) + (y - x)| \le |z - y| + |y - x| < \delta + |y - x| \le
\varepsilon$. Note that $\varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ precisely because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, so such a $\delta$ always exists.

## Remarks

- **The radius is a real number, not a rational.** Nothing on this page tests a
  condition against rational radii only. That convention belongs to
  [[def-real-limit]], where the quantifier is over rational $\varepsilon$ and
  the passage between the rational and the real form is the sanctioned remark of
  [[def-sequence]]. Here $\varepsilon$ ranges over the positive reals
  throughout, and every statement above is proved for an arbitrary positive
  real.

- **Why the punctured version is separated out.** A limit point of a set is a
  point every punctured neighbourhood of which meets the set
  ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and deleting the centre is exactly what stops a point
  of the set from qualifying automatically. The unpunctured condition defines
  the weaker notion of an adherent point, and the difference between the two is
  precisely an isolated point.

- **Nesting is the workhorse.** Almost every openness verification on this page
  has the shape "given $y$ in the set, shrink the radius by the distance
  already travelled", which is the nesting property above. It is recorded here
  once so that no later proof has to redo the triangle inequality in passing.

## Definition

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ ([[def-field]]) together with a subset
$P \subseteq F$, the set of **positive** elements (the *positive cone*),
satisfying:

- **(O1) Trichotomy.** For each $x \in F$, exactly one of the following holds:
  $x \in P$, or $x = 0$, or $-x \in P$.
- **(O2) Closure.** If $x, y \in P$ then $x + y \in P$ and $x \cdot y \in P$.

We write $x > 0$ for $x \in P$ (read "$x$ is positive"), and define the order by

$$a < b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; b - a \in P, \qquad a \le b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; a < b \text{ or } a = b.$$

Thus $a > b$ means $b < a$, and $a \ge b$ means $b \le a$. An element $x$ with
$-x \in P$ (equivalently $x < 0$) is called **negative**.

## Remarks

- By trichotomy applied to $b - a$, for any $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$,
  $a = b$, $a > b$ holds; this makes $\le$ a total order.
- (O2) says the positives are closed under addition and multiplication: sums and
  products of positives are positive.
- The rationals ([[thm-rat-ordered-field]]) and both constructions of the reals
  ([[thm-reals-ordered-field]], [[thm-reals-dedekind-ordered-field]]) are ordered
  fields, so every fact proved here from (O1)-(O2) holds in each of them.

## Statement

For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and all $a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n \in \mathbb{R}$, the
set $\{a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ has a maximum and a minimum ([[def-max-min]]).

What is proved below is exactly the displayed statement, by induction on $n$.

The usual reading, that *every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has a
maximum and a minimum*, follows once one identifies the nonempty finite subsets
of $\mathbb{R}$ with the sets listable as $\{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$. That
identification is recorded as a stipulation in the Given below, because this page
has no definition of finiteness to prove it against. **It is discharged, not
merely assumed**: [[lem-finite-subsets-listable]] proves that the two
descriptions of a nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ agree. That lemma is
recorded in `justified_by` rather than in `deps`, since it is about the sets this
lemma quantifies over and therefore depends on this one. This is what licenses
the notation
$\max\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ and $\min\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ for finite sets of
**real** numbers from this page onwards.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Real numbers $a_0, a_1, a_2, \dots$; for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write $F_n := \{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$, so that $F_{n+1} = F_n \cup \{a_{n+1}\}$. A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and finite exactly when it equals $F_n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and some choice of $a_0, \dots, a_n$.

[A1] $P(n)$ denotes the statement: for all $a_0, \dots, a_n \in \mathbb{R}$, the set $F_n$ has a maximum and a minimum.

[L1] Maximum and minimum: $m = \max X$ means $m \in X$ and $x \le m$ for all $x \in X$; $m = \min X$ means $m \in X$ and $m \le x$ for all $x \in X$; each is unique when it exists ([[def-max-min]]).

[L2] Induction principle: if $P(0)$ holds and $P(n)$ implies $P(n+1)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $P(n)$ holds for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, where $n + 1$ denotes the successor $\sigma(n)$ ([[thm-induction-principle]], [[def-nat-addition]]).

[L3] The order on $\mathbb{R}$ is reflexive, total and transitive: $a \le a$; for all $a, b$ exactly one of $a < b$, $a = b$, $b < a$ holds, so at least one of $a \le b$ and $b \le a$ holds; and $a \le b$ with $b \le c$ gives $a \le c$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case: $F_0 = \{a_0\}$, and $a_0 \in F_0$ with $a_0 \le a_0$ by reflexivity, so $a_0$ is both a maximum and a minimum of $F_0$; hence $P(0)$ holds. [base, A1, L1, L3]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and assume $P(n)$, that is, for all reals $a_0, \dots, a_n$ the set $F_n$ has a maximum and a minimum. [ih, A1]

2.1 Let $a_0, \dots, a_{n+1} \in \mathbb{R}$ be arbitrary; by the inductive hypothesis the set $F_n$ has a maximum $M$ and a minimum $m$, and $F_{n+1} = F_n \cup \{a_{n+1}\}$. [step 1.2, L1]

3.1 By totality at least one of $a_{n+1} \le M$ and $M \le a_{n+1}$ holds. If $a_{n+1} \le M$, then $M \in F_n \subseteq F_{n+1}$, every element of $F_n$ is $\le M$ because $M = \max F_n$, and $a_{n+1} \le M$ as well, so $M$ is a maximum of $F_{n+1}$. If $M \le a_{n+1}$, then $a_{n+1} \in F_{n+1}$, every $x \in F_n$ satisfies $x \le M \le a_{n+1}$ hence $x \le a_{n+1}$ by transitivity, and $a_{n+1} \le a_{n+1}$, so $a_{n+1}$ is a maximum of $F_{n+1}$. Either way $F_{n+1}$ has a maximum. [step 2.1, L1, L3]

3.2 Dually, at least one of $m \le a_{n+1}$ and $a_{n+1} \le m$ holds. If $m \le a_{n+1}$, then $m \in F_{n+1}$ and every element of $F_{n+1}$ is $\ge m$, so $m$ is a minimum of $F_{n+1}$. If $a_{n+1} \le m$, then $a_{n+1} \in F_{n+1}$ and every $x \in F_n$ satisfies $a_{n+1} \le m \le x$ hence $a_{n+1} \le x$ by transitivity, so $a_{n+1}$ is a minimum of $F_{n+1}$. Either way $F_{n+1}$ has a minimum. [step 2.1, L1, L3]

4.1 Since $a_0, \dots, a_{n+1}$ were arbitrary, $F_{n+1}$ has a maximum and a minimum for every such list, that is, $P(n)$ implies $P(n+1)$. [step 3.1, step 3.2, A1]

5.1 The base case and the inductive step give $P(n)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ by the induction principle; since a nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is exactly a set of the form $F_n$, every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has both a maximum and a minimum. [step 1.1, step 4.1, given, L2, discharge-induction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the stipulation is discharged.** Finiteness itself is defined later, in [[def-countable]], as equinumerosity with a von Neumann natural; with that definition in hand [[lem-finite-subsets-listable]] proves that a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and finite exactly when it is listable as $\{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$, which is the Given below. So nothing on this page rests on an assumption that is never paid for; it is paid for later, and the payment is recorded in `justified_by`.
- **Only the total order is used, never completeness.** The base case needs reflexivity, the inductive step needs totality and transitivity, and the induction itself runs over $\mathbb{N}$. The same induction works in any totally ordered field; what is recorded here is its specialisation to $\mathbb{R}$.
- Nonemptiness is essential: $\emptyset$ is finite and has no maximum ([[def-max-min]]). Finiteness is essential too: $\{x \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < x < 1\}$ is bounded and has no maximum ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Combined with claim 1 of [[lem-max-is-sup]], this says every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has a supremum, and that the supremum is attained, because it equals the maximum. The infimum half is *not* part of [[lem-max-is-sup]], which speaks only of maxima and suprema; it follows from the minimum proved here together with the reflection identity $\inf X = -\sup(-X)$ ([[lem-reflection]], [[thm-infimum-property]]).

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$, with
$|x|$ the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]). Then

$$|x| \ge 0; \quad |x| = 0 \iff x = 0; \quad -|x| \le x \le |x|; \quad |-x| = |x|; \quad |xy| = |x|\,|y|;$$

and, for every $c > 0$, one has $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and elements $x, y \in F$.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| = u$ if $u \ge 0$, and $|u| = -u$ if $u < 0$ ([[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Ordered-field order: trichotomy holds (for each $u$ exactly one of $u > 0$, $u = 0$, $u < 0$), $a < b$ means $b - a$ is positive, and sums and products of positives are positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Signs in products: $(-a)b = -(ab)$ and $(-a)(-b) = ab$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] Sign rules: a product of two elements of the same sign is positive, and a product of two elements of opposite sign is negative ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Case $x > 0$: by [L1] $|x| = x > 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; since $-x < 0$ we get $|-x| = -(-x) = x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -x < 0 < x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case pos, L1, L2, algebra]

1.2 Case $x = 0$: then $|x| = |0| = 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ holds with $|x| = 0$ and $x = 0$, while $|-x| = |0| = |x|$ and $-|x| = 0 \le 0 \le 0 = |x|$. [assume-case zero, L1]

1.3 Case $x < 0$: by [L1] $|x| = -x$, and [L2] gives $-x > 0$, so $|x| > 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; here $|-x| = -x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -(-x) = x \le x$ while $x < 0 < -x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case neg, L1, L2, algebra]

1.4 Case $x = 0$ or $y = 0$: then $xy = 0$, so $|xy| = 0$, and one of $|x|, |y|$ is $0$, whence $|x|\,|y| = 0 = |xy|$. [assume-case zerofactor, L1]

1.5 Case $x, y$ have the same sign (both positive or both negative): by [L4] $xy > 0$, so $|xy| = xy$, while $|x|\,|y| = xy$ by [L3] (for $x, y < 0$ this is $(-x)(-y) = xy$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case same, L1, L3, L4]

1.6 Case $x, y$ have opposite signs (one positive, one negative): by [L4] $xy < 0$, so $|xy| = -(xy)$, while $|x|\,|y| = -(xy)$ by [L3] (namely $x(-y)$ or $(-x)y$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case opposite, L1, L3, L4]

2.1 By trichotomy [L2] each $x$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.1-1.3, and in each we verified $|x| \ge 0$, that $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$, that $|-x| = |x|$, and that $-|x| \le x \le |x|$; hence all four hold for every $x$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, cases-exhaustive]

2.2 By trichotomy [L2] each pair $x, y$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.4-1.6, and in each $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$ for all $x, y$. [step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6, cases-exhaustive]

3.1 Let $c > 0$: if $|x| < c$ then $-c < -|x| \le x \le |x| < c$ by [step 2.1] and [L2], so $-c < x < c$; conversely if $-c < x < c$ then both $x < c$ and $-x < c$, and since $|x|$ equals $x$ or $-x$ by [L1], we get $|x| < c$, so $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$. [step 2.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Statement

Write $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the image of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$
under the canonical embedding $q \mapsto \hat q$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), the
set usually written $\mathbb{Q}$ once the identification is made, and put
$X := \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the irrationals. Then:

1. $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$, that is,
   $\overline{\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}} = \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]);
2. $X$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$;
3. every nonempty open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable
   ([[def-countable]]).

Claim 2 is not a symmetry of claim 1: the rationals are dense because they are
*constructed* to approximate, whereas the irrationals are dense because there are
too many points in any interval for a countable set to exhaust it, which is why
claim 3 is proved alongside and used for it.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The canonical embedding $q \mapsto \hat q$ of $\mathbb{Q}$ into $\mathbb{R}$, its image $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, and the complement $X = \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$.

[L1] $\overline{A}$ is the set of points every neighbourhood of which meets $A$; $A$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ when $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L2] $N_\varepsilon(x) = (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon)$ for real $\varepsilon > 0$, and $x - \varepsilon < x + \varepsilon$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L3] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L4] Strictly between any two reals lies an element of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, and $q \mapsto \hat q$ is injective ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).

[L5] $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-rationals-countable]]); an injection is a bijection onto its image, and $\approx$ is symmetric and transitive ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]], [[def-equinumerous]]).

[L6] Every subset of an at most countable set is at most countable, and uncountable means not at most countable ([[lem-subset-of-countable]], [[def-countable]]).

[L7] For $a < b$ the interval $(a,b)$ is uncountable ([[cor-interval-uncountable]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is dense: let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real; by [L2] one has $x - \varepsilon < x + \varepsilon$, so [L4] supplies $\hat q$ with $x - \varepsilon < \hat q < x + \varepsilon$, that is $\hat q \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$. Every real is therefore an adherent point of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and claim 1 follows from [L1]. [L1, L2, L4]

1.2 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is at most countable: the embedding is an injection of $\mathbb{Q}$ with image $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, hence a bijection onto it, so $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \approx \mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$. [L4, L5]

1.3 For all reals $a < b$ the interval $(a,b)$ is uncountable. [L7]

2.1 For all reals $a < b$ the interval $(a,b)$ contains an irrational: if it did not, then $(a,b) \subseteq \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, so $(a,b)$ would be a subset of an at most countable set by step 1.2 and hence at most countable by [L6], contradicting step 1.3. So some $z \in (a,b)$ lies in $X$. [step 1.2, step 1.3, L6]

2.2 Every nonempty open $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is uncountable: fix $x \in U$ and, by [L3], a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; by [L2] the set $N_\varepsilon(x)$ is the interval $(x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon)$ with $x - \varepsilon < x + \varepsilon$, hence uncountable by step 1.3. Were $U$ at most countable, its subset $N_\varepsilon(x)$ would be at most countable by [L6], which it is not; so $U$ is uncountable, which is claim 3. [step 1.3, L2, L3, L6, choose]

3.1 $X$ is dense: let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real; applying step 2.1 with $a = x - \varepsilon$ and $b = x + \varepsilon$ gives $z \in (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon) \cap X$, which is $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap X$ by [L2]. Every real is therefore an adherent point of $X$, so $\overline{X} = \mathbb{R}$ by [L1], which is claim 2. [step 2.1, L1, L2]

4.1 Claims 1, 2 and 3 are steps 1.1, 3.1 and 2.2, so both $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and its complement are dense in $\mathbb{R}$ and every nonempty open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable. [step 1.1, step 2.2, step 3.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Two dense sets can be disjoint.** $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and $X$ partition
  $\mathbb{R}$ and both are dense, so density says nothing about size: one of
  them is countable and the other is not
  ([[cor-irrationals-uncountable]]). What density does say is that neither has
  interior: a set whose complement is dense has empty interior, which is the
  computation carried out for $\mathbb{Q}$ in
  [[ex-closure-interior-boundary-of-q]].

- **Claim 3 is a statement about open sets, not about intervals.** It follows
  from the uncountability of intervals ([[cor-interval-uncountable]]) only
  because openness supplies an interval inside the set at each of its points.
  A nonempty set with empty interior can perfectly well be countable, as
  $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ shows.

- **An explicit irrational is not produced here.** Step 2.1 is a counting
  argument and exhibits nothing. The library does exhibit one separately,
  $\sqrt 2$ ([[thm-of-square-roots]], [[fs-sqrt2-rational]]), and an explicit
  irrational in a given interval $(a,b)$ can be built from it as
  $q_1 + (q_2 - q_1)/\sqrt 2$ for suitable rationals $q_1 < q_2$ in the
  interval; that route is longer and is not the one taken above.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with closure $\overline{A}$ as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]] and derived set $A'$ as in
[[def-limit-point-r]]. Write

$$E \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing \text{ for every real } \varepsilon > 0 \,\}$$

for the set of adherent points of $A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). Then:

1. $\overline{A} = E$.
2. $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$.
3. $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed superset of $A$: it is closed, it
   contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed $F$ with $A \subseteq F$.
4. $A$ is closed if and only if $A = \overline{A}$, if and only if
   $A' \subseteq A$.

Claim 3 is the content of the definition of $\overline{A}$ and is restated here
so that the four descriptions stand together; claims 1, 2 and 4 are the ones
that carry work.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, and the set $E$ of adherent points of $A$ as displayed in the Statement.

[L1] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; $F$ is closed when $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L2] $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$; $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) = N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$; and if $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ then $\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ and $N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] $\overline{A}$ is the intersection of the nonempty family of closed supersets of $A$; it is closed, it contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed superset of $A$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]).

[L4] $x$ is an adherent point of $A$ when every $N_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $A$, a limit point when every $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $A$, and $A'$ is the set of limit points ([[def-limit-point-r]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $A \subseteq E$: for $x \in A$ and any $\varepsilon > 0$ one has $x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$, so that intersection is nonempty. [L2, L4]

1.2 Let $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus E$; by the definition of $E$ there is a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$. [L4, choose]

1.3 Let $F$ be closed with $A \subseteq F$, and let $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus F$; since $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open there is a real $\eta > 0$ with $N_\eta(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus F$. [L1, choose]

2.1 For every $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ the radius $\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x|$ is positive and $N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, so $N_\delta(y) \cap A = \varnothing$ and $y \notin E$; hence $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$, and since $x$ was an arbitrary point of $\mathbb{R} \setminus E$ that set is open, that is, $E$ is closed. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L4]

2.2 From $N_\eta(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus F \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus A$ we get $N_\eta(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, so $x \notin E$; hence $\mathbb{R} \setminus F \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$, that is, $E \subseteq F$, for every closed $F \supseteq A$. [step 1.3, L4]

3.1 By steps 1.1 and 2.1 the set $E$ is a closed superset of $A$, so $\overline{A} \subseteq E$ by the leastness in [L3]; and $\overline{A}$ is itself a closed superset of $A$ by [L3], so step 2.2 applied to $F = \overline{A}$ gives $E \subseteq \overline{A}$. Hence $\overline{A} = E$, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, L3]

4.1 $E = A \cup A'$: if $x \in E$ and $x \notin A$ then for every $\varepsilon > 0$ some $a \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ exists, and $a \ne x$ because $x \notin A$, so $a \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ and $x \in A'$; conversely $A \subseteq E$ by step 1.1, and $A' \subseteq E$ because $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$. Combining with step 3.1 gives $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$, which is claim 2. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L2, L4]

5.1 Claim 4: if $A$ is closed then $A$ is a closed superset of itself, so $\overline{A} \subseteq A$ by [L3], while $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ by [L3], whence $A = \overline{A}$; conversely if $A = \overline{A}$ then $A$ is closed because $\overline{A}$ is. Finally $A = \overline{A}$ says $A = A \cup A'$ by step 4.1, and $A = A \cup A'$ holds exactly when $A' \subseteq A$. [step 4.1, L3]

6.1 Claim 3 is [L3] restated, and claims 1, 2 and 4 are steps 3.1, 4.1 and 5.1, so all four hold. [step 3.1, step 4.1, step 5.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Which claim does the work in practice.** Claim 1 is the one used almost
  everywhere below: to show a point lies in $\overline{A}$ one exhibits, for each
  $\varepsilon > 0$, a point of $A$ within $\varepsilon$ of it. Claim 2 is what
  separates the two ways a point can be adherent, by membership or by
  accumulation, and it is what makes the notion of an isolated point visible.

- **No special property of $\mathbb{R}$ is used.** The argument uses the
  definitions of open, closed, neighbourhood and closure, and the order enters
  only through the nesting property of neighbourhoods; neither the
  least-upper-bound property nor the Archimedean property appears at any step.
  The results of this page that do use them are flagged in
  [[rem-r-native-topology-scope]].

- **The sequential form is a separate theorem and costs more.** Replacing
  "every neighbourhood meets $A$" by "some sequence in $A$ converges to $x$" is
  [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]], and the passage from the
  first to the second spends the axiom of countable choice, since it selects one
  point of $A$ from each of infinitely many neighbourhoods. The characterisation
  proved above is choice free.
