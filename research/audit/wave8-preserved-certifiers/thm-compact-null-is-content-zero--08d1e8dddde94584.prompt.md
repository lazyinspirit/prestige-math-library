# Independent repair certifier brief — Wave 8, step A6

> **NO SHELL-PERMISSION PROMPTS (owner, 2026-07-30) — binding on every current

You are **GPT 5.6 Terra** at `xhigh` effort with a 1,000,000-token context
window. You are an independent, read-only certifier of one Audit-Beta repair.
You did not author it. Your Codex lane has a mechanically read-only shell: use
non-mutating commands such as `rg`, `sed`, and `git diff` to read the current
workspace and use web access where a source check is material. Do not edit,
delegate, escalate, or ask for a shell permission. Shell reads already allowed
inside the read-only sandbox require no owner approval.

## Triage — the standing rule (verbatim, binding on you)

- **Non-negotiable:** mathematical accuracy, logical validity, correct
  citation.
- **Explicitly acceptable, spend no effort:** minor citational quirks; logical
  gaps a competent reader closes **within 30 seconds**; other non-fatal quirks;
  imperfection at the level of the letter.

Read the assigned item's **current final text from disk**, not merely its task
summary. Read each dependency relevant to the repaired inference. Check the
title and public statement, every numbered step, Facts & Assumptions, Remarks,
dependency lists, provenance tags, and verification block. Where an exact
external source is material, use web access to check that source. Confirm that
stale pre-repair `verification.judge`/`verification.audited` evidence is absent
and that the stated repair fixes its named defect without introducing a new
one. A passing mechanical gate is supporting evidence, not a mathematical
substitute.

For a repaired page, read its complete current text and the current items it
summarizes, then check the repaired mathematical assertion and page/item
consistency. Pages do not carry item verification blocks.

Return exactly:

```text
ITEM: <id-or-page-path>
VERDICT: CERTIFIED | REFUSED | BLOCKED
CURRENT-TEXT: READ
MATHEMATICS: [concise evidence]
CITATIONS: [concise evidence]
METADATA: [provenance/dependencies/stale-verdict disposition, or n/a for a page]
FINDINGS: NONE | [fatal defect or concrete blocker]
```

Do not suggest optional polishing and do not write a verification stamp. Audit-
Alpha decides whether the independent reading licenses one.

## Statement

Let $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be compact ([[def-open-cover-r]]), equivalently
closed and bounded ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]]). Then

$$K \text{ has measure zero} \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad K \text{ has content zero}$$

([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

The implication from content zero to measure zero is
[[lem-content-zero-implies-null]] and needs no hypothesis on $K$. The other
direction is the one that uses compactness, and it uses it exactly as
[[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]] does: a countable cover is enlarged to
an open cover at an arbitrarily small cost in total length, and compactness
reduces the open cover to a finite one.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A compact set $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a real $\varepsilon > 0$. Throughout, $\theta := 2^{-1}$.

[L1] $A$ is null when for every real $\eta > 0$ there are sequences $(a_k)$, $(b_k)$ with $a_k \le b_k$, $A \subseteq \bigcup_k[a_k,b_k]$ and $\sum_{k<i}(b_k - a_k) \le \eta$ for every $i$; $A$ has content zero when the same holds with a finite list ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]).

[L2] A set of content zero is null ([[lem-content-zero-implies-null]]).

[L3] $[c,d]$ has length $d - c \ge 0$ for $c \le d$; $(c,d)$ is the open interval with the same endpoints and is contained in $[c,d]$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L4] Every open interval is an open set ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L5] $K$ is compact: from every family of open sets whose union contains $K$, either $K = \varnothing$ and the empty subfamily covers it, or there are $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and members $U_0, \dots, U_m$ of the family whose union contains $K$; compactness is equivalent to being closed and bounded ([[def-open-cover-r]], [[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]]).

[L6] Powers and the geometric series: $\theta^0 = 1$, $\theta^{k+1} = \theta^k\theta$, $\theta^k > 0$, and $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\theta^k = 2$ for $\theta = 2^{-1}$; a series of nonnegative terms has all its partial sums at most its sum ([[def-integer-power]], [[thm-geometric-series]], [[def-series]], [[thm-nonnegative-series-bounded-partial-sums]]).

[L7] Finite sums: additivity, scaling, splitting and monotonicity in the terms ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L8] Every finite list of naturals has an upper bound in $\mathbb{N}$, by induction on its length and the totality of the order of $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]], [[lem-nat-trichotomy]], [[def-nat-order]]).

[L9] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 > 0$, $4 > 0$, $8 > 0$ and $t \cdot 8^{-1} > 0$ for $t > 0$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve an inequality ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 One direction is immediate: if $K$ has content zero then $K$ is null by [L2], with no hypothesis on $K$ used. It remains to prove the converse for compact $K$. [L2, suffices: only the forward direction remains]

1.2 If $K = \varnothing$, then for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the single interval $[0,0]$ covers $K$ and has total length $0 \le \varepsilon$, so $K$ has content zero by [L1]. Hence suppose $K \ne \varnothing$ for the rest of the proof. [L1, cases]

2.1 Assume $K$ is null and let the real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. By [L1] applied with $\eta := \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} > 0$ fix sequences $(a_k)$, $(b_k)$ with $a_k \le b_k$, $K \subseteq \bigcup_k [a_k,b_k]$ and $\sum_{k<i}(b_k - a_k) \le \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$ for every $i \in \mathbb{N}$. [step 1.1, given, L1, L9, choose]

3.1 Put $\delta_k := \varepsilon \cdot 8^{-1} \cdot \theta^{k}$, a positive real by [L6] and [L9], and $J_k := (a_k - \delta_k,\ b_k + \delta_k)$, an open set by [L4] containing $[a_k,b_k]$ by [L3] and [L9]. Hence $\{\, J_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\}$ is a family of open sets whose union contains $K$, and the closed interval $[a_k - \delta_k,\ b_k + \delta_k]$ has length $(b_k - a_k) + 2\delta_k = (b_k - a_k) + \varepsilon \cdot 4^{-1} \cdot \theta^{k}$ by [L3] and [L9]. [step 2.1, L3, L4, L6, L9]

4.1 By [L5] there are $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and members $J_{k_0}, \dots, J_{k_m}$ of that family covering $K$, and by [L8] there is $N \in \mathbb{N}$ with $k_t \le N$ for every $t \le m$; then $K \subseteq \bigcup_{k \le N} J_k \subseteq \bigcup_{k \le N}[a_k - \delta_k,\ b_k + \delta_k]$ by [L3]. [step 1.2, step 3.1, L3, L5, L8, choose]

5.1 The total length of that finite list is $\sum_{k \le N}\big((b_k - a_k) + \varepsilon \cdot 4^{-1}\theta^{k}\big) = \sum_{k<N+1}(b_k - a_k) + \varepsilon \cdot 4^{-1}\sum_{k<N+1}\theta^{k} \le \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1} + \varepsilon \cdot 4^{-1} \cdot 2 = \varepsilon$, by [L7], step 2.1, [L6] and [L9]. [step 2.1, step 3.1, step 4.1, L6, L7, L9]

6.1 So for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the finite list of step 4.1 covers $K$ with total length at most $\varepsilon$, which by [L1] is exactly the statement that $K$ has content zero; together with step 1.1 the two notions coincide on compact sets. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 4.1, step 5.1, L1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Compactness, not boundedness, is what does the work.** $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$ is bounded and null and does not have content zero ([[cex-null-set-not-of-content-zero]]); it fails to be closed, and the finite subcover step is exactly what it cannot supply.

- **The theorem is what makes content zero usable at all.** Every set to which content zero is applied on this page is compact: the Cantor set ([[thm-cantor-set-properties]]) and the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set ([[def-fat-cantor-set]]) are both closed and bounded, so for them the two notions may be used interchangeably, and the finite form is the one that combines with [[lem-finite-interval-cover-total-length]].

- **The cost of opening up the cover is $\varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$, chosen in advance.** Splitting the budget in half before the enlargement, rather than after, is what keeps the final total at $\varepsilon$ exactly; the same bookkeeping appears in [[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]] and in [[thm-countable-union-of-null-is-null]].
