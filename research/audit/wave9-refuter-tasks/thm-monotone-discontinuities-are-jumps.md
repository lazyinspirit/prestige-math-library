## Statement

Let $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be order-convex ([[def-interval]]) and let
$f : I \to \mathbb{R}$ be nondecreasing ([[def-monotone-function]]). Write
$I^{-} = I \cap (-\infty,c)$ and $I^{+} = I \cap (c,\infty)$ for $c \in I$.

1. At every $c \in I$, each of the two one-sided limits that is well posed
   exists ([[def-one-sided-limits]]). Consequently $f$ has **no discontinuity of
   the second kind** ([[def-classification-of-discontinuities]]): every
   discontinuity of $f$ is of the first kind.
2. Call $c \in I$ an **interior point of $I$** when both $I^{-}$ and $I^{+}$ are
   nonempty. At such a point
   $$\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) \;\le\; f(c) \;\le\; \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x),$$
   and $f$ is continuous at $c$ ([[def-continuity-real]]) **if and only if**
   $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) = \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$.
3. Hence an interior point $c$ is a discontinuity of $f$ exactly when
   $$\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) \;<\; \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x),$$
   and every such discontinuity is a **jump**, of jump
   $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x) - \lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) > 0$.

The same three claims hold for a nonincreasing $f$, with the two one-sided
limits exchanged and all inequalities reversed, by applying the above to $-f$,
which is nondecreasing ([[def-monotone-function]]) and has exactly the same
points of continuity, since $|(-f)(x) - (-f)(c)| = |f(x) - f(c)|$.

**A point of $I$ that is not interior is an endpoint, and there are at most
two.** $I^{-} = \varnothing$ says that $c$ is a least element of $I$ and
$I^{+} = \varnothing$ that it is a greatest one, and a set has at most one of
each. Those two points are excluded from claims 2 and 3 only because a
comparison of two one-sided limits is not available there; claim 1 covers them.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An order-convex $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a nondecreasing $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$, and $c \in I$.

[L1] If $I^{-} \ne \varnothing$ then $c$ is a limit point of $I^{-}$ and $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) = \sup\{f(x) : x \in I, x < c\} \le f(c)$; if $I^{+} \ne \varnothing$ then $c$ is a limit point of $I^{+}$ and $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x) = \inf\{f(x) : x \in I, x > c\} \ge f(c)$ ([[thm-monotone-one-sided-limits-exist]]).

[L2] If $c$ is a limit point of both $I^{-}$ and $I^{+}$, then $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$ holds if and only if both one-sided limits at $c$ exist and equal $L$; in particular the two-sided limit exists exactly when the two one-sided limits exist and agree ([[thm-two-sided-limit-iff-both-one-sided]]).

[L3] At a limit point $c \in I$ of $I$, $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ exists and equals $f(c)$; at an isolated point of $I$ every function is continuous ([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-classification-of-discontinuities]]).

[L4] A discontinuity at a two-sided point is of the second kind when at least one one-sided limit fails to exist, of the first kind otherwise, and is a jump when the two one-sided limits exist and differ; at a one-sided point it is of the first kind when the one available one-sided limit exists ([[def-classification-of-discontinuities]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $c \in I$. If $I^{-} \ne \varnothing$ then $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x)$ exists, and if $I^{+} \ne \varnothing$ then $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$ exists; if one of the two sets is empty the corresponding symbol is not defined and there is nothing to prove for it. [L1]

2.1 Claim 1 follows: at every point of $I$ every well-posed one-sided limit of $f$ exists, so no discontinuity of $f$ can be of the second kind, and every discontinuity is therefore of the first kind. [step 1.1, L4]

2.2 Now let $c$ be an interior point of $I$, and write $L^{-} := \lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x)$ and $L^{+} := \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$, both of which exist by step 1.1. Then $L^{-} \le f(c) \le L^{+}$, which is the displayed inequality of claim 2. [step 1.1, L1]

3.1 Suppose $L^{-} = L^{+}$. Then $L^{-} \le f(c) \le L^{+} = L^{-}$ forces $L^{-} = f(c) = L^{+}$, so both one-sided limits equal $f(c)$; hence $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ exists and equals $f(c)$, and $f$ is continuous at $c$. [step 2.2, L2, L3]

3.2 Suppose conversely that $f$ is continuous at $c$. Since $c$ is a limit point of $I^{-}$ and hence of $I$, continuity gives $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$, and then both one-sided limits exist and equal $f(c)$; in particular $L^{-} = L^{+}$. [step 2.2, L1, L2, L3]

4.1 Claim 2 is proved by steps 3.1 and 3.2 together with step 2.2. [step 2.2, step 3.1, step 3.2]

5.1 Claim 3: at an interior point $c$, $f$ is discontinuous exactly when $L^{-} \ne L^{+}$, and since $L^{-} \le f(c) \le L^{+}$ the only way for them to differ is $L^{-} < L^{+}$. Both one-sided limits exist and differ, so the discontinuity is a jump, of jump $L^{+} - L^{-} > 0$. [step 2.2, step 4.1, L4] ∎

## Remarks

- **Nothing here counts the discontinuities.** Claim 3 says only what a discontinuity of a monotone function looks like at an interior point. That the set of them is at most countable is a further theorem, [[thm-froda]], and its proof is exactly the observation that the open intervals $(\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x), \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x))$ attached to distinct discontinuities are disjoint.

- **Why no interior discontinuity of a monotone function is removable.** Claim 2 rules them out at interior points: there $L^{-} = L^{+}$ already forces continuity, because the inequality $L^{-} \le f(c) \le L^{+}$ pins $f(c)$ between the two one-sided values. That inequality is special to monotone functions, and it is what makes *jump* the only kind of interior discontinuity available. At a point of $I$ that is not interior the inequality is one-sided too and the argument does not apply, so a monotone function may fail to be continuous at an endpoint of $I$ while having its one one-sided limit; that failure is a discontinuity of the first kind and it is not a jump, there being only one side to compare.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Then
$f$ is **discontinuous at $c$**, and $c$ is a **discontinuity of $f$**, when $f$
is not continuous at $c$ ([[def-continuity-real]]). As in
[[def-one-sided-limits]] write

$$A^{-} := A \cap (-\infty, c), \qquad A^{+} := A \cap (c, \infty)$$

([[def-interval]]), and recall that $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x)$ is defined only
when $c$ is a limit point of $A^{-}$, and $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$ only when
$c$ is a limit point of $A^{+}$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]).

**At an isolated point there is nothing to classify.** If $c$ is an isolated
point of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so that $A \cap N_{\rho}(c) = \{c\}$ for
some real $\rho > 0$, then $f$ is continuous at $c$: the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$
condition of [[def-continuity-real]] is satisfied by $\delta := \rho$, since the
only $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \rho$ is $c$ itself and $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0$. So
every discontinuity is a limit point of $A$, and the classification below covers
every case that occurs.

### Two-sided points

Suppose $c$ is a limit point of **both** $A^{-}$ and $A^{+}$, so that both
one-sided limits are well posed. Say that $c$ is a discontinuity

- **of the first kind** when both one-sided limits exist;
- **of the second kind**, also called **essential**, when at least one of the two
  one-sided limits fails to exist.

A discontinuity of the first kind is further

- **removable** when $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) = \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$; the
  common value is then different from $f(c)$, for otherwise
  [[thm-two-sided-limit-iff-both-one-sided]] would give
  $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$ and $f$ would be continuous at $c$
  ([[def-continuity-real]]);
- a **jump** when $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) \ne \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$; the
  difference $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x) - \lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x)$ is then called
  the **jump of $f$ at $c$**.

The three cases *removable*, *jump*, *essential* are mutually exclusive and
exhaust the two-sided discontinuities of $f$: either both one-sided limits
exist, and then they are equal or not, or one of them does not exist.

**Removable is a name for what can be repaired.** If $c$ is a removable
discontinuity with common one-sided value $L$, then the function agreeing with
$f$ off $c$ and taking the value $L$ at $c$ is continuous at $c$, again by
[[thm-two-sided-limit-iff-both-one-sided]] and [[def-continuity-real]]: changing
the single value $f(c)$ removes the discontinuity. No such repair is available at
a jump or at an essential discontinuity, since there the two-sided limit does not
exist at all and no choice of value at $c$ can create it.

### One-sided points

If $c$ is a limit point of exactly one of $A^{-}$ and $A^{+}$, only that side is
defined and only that side is used: $c$ is a discontinuity **of the first kind**
when the one-sided limit on the side in question exists, and **of the second
kind** otherwise. When it exists it is different from $f(c)$, since on such a
point the one-sided condition and the continuity condition are the same
condition; and there is no jump case, there being nothing to compare the value
with. The endpoints of an interval are the typical instance.

**On the two vocabularies.** *First kind* and *second kind* are Rudin's terms and
are recorded because the literature uses them; *removable*, *jump* and
*essential* are the names used in the rest of this library. They name the same
three cases and no third classification is introduced.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field with its order and
absolute value ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]), and
neighbourhoods are those of [[def-neighbourhood-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Then
$f$ is **continuous at $c$** when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

with $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ ranging over the **positive reals**. In the
language of neighbourhoods: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ with

$$f\bigl(A \cap N_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \;\subseteq\; N_{\varepsilon}\bigl(f(c)\bigr).$$

$f$ is **continuous on $A$** when it is continuous at every point of $A$.

**The point $c$ is required to lie in $A$, and the condition is unpunctured.**
Both differ from [[def-function-limit]], and deliberately. There the quantifier
runs over $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, which removes $x = c$; here $x = c$ is allowed,
and at $x = c$ the implication reads $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$, which is
automatic. So allowing $x = c$ costs nothing, and it is what lets the definition
be stated at every point of $A$, including the points where no limit exists.

**Three clauses, and all three are part of the definition.**

1. **At a limit point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is a limit point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]). Then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if the
   limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) \;=\; f(c)$$
   ([[def-function-limit]]). Indeed, for a given $\varepsilon > 0$ a $\delta$
   witnessing continuity witnesses the limit condition, because the limit
   condition quantifies over a subset of the points continuity quantifies over;
   and conversely a $\delta$ witnessing $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$ witnesses
   continuity, because the one point it omits, $x = c$, satisfies
   $|f(c) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ anyway.

2. **At an isolated point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is an isolated point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so that $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ for some real
   $\eta > 0$. Then **every** $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$: take
   $\delta := \eta$, so that the only $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ is $c$
   itself, and $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$.

3. **On a set.** Continuity on $A$ is continuity at each point of $A$, and
   nothing more. It is not a condition relating $f$ to points outside $A$.

Every point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$,
and never both ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so clauses 1 and 2 between them describe
continuity at every point of $A$.

**This is not the raw $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula of
[[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]].** That item records what goes
wrong when the *punctured* formula of [[def-function-limit]] is written down at
an arbitrary point of the domain: at an isolated point it is satisfied
vacuously by every real $L$ at once, so it defines nothing, and this library
therefore leaves $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ **undefined** at an isolated point.
Continuity at an isolated point is a different matter: the formula above is not
vacuous — it is a genuine condition on $f(c)$, satisfied because $f(c)$ is the
only value being compared with itself — and it names a single, well-defined
property. The limit is undefined there; the continuity is defined, and is
automatic. Clause 1 is the only place where the two notions meet, and it is
stated only where the limit exists as a notion.

**Where the distinction disappears.** If $A$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), then every $c \in A$ has some
$N_{\eta}(c) \subseteq A$, and a punctured neighbourhood is never empty
([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), so every point of $A$ is a limit point of $A$ and
clause 1 covers the whole of $A$. The same holds when $A$ is a nondegenerate
interval ([[def-interval]]). Isolated points are what force clause 2 to exist at
all, and they occur as soon as $A$ is allowed to be an arbitrary subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, as in $A = \{0\} \cup [1,2]$.

## Remarks

- **Continuity is local.** If $\eta > 0$ and $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agrees with
  $f$ on $A \cap N_{\eta}(c)$, then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if $g$
  is: any $\delta$ may be replaced by $\min\{\delta, \eta\}$, after which the
  condition only ever evaluates the two functions where they agree. So
  continuity at $c$ sees only an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of $c$, exactly
  as the limit does ([[lem-limit-is-local]]).

- **Continuity passes to subsets of the domain.** If $B \subseteq A$ and
  $c \in B$, then continuity of $f$ at $c$ gives continuity of the restriction
  $f|_B$ at $c$, with the same $\delta$: the condition on $f|_B$ quantifies over
  fewer points. The converse fails, and the standard witness is the indicator of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ restricted to $\mathbb{Q}$, which is constant and hence
  continuous, while the indicator itself is continuous nowhere
  ([[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]]).

- **The radius is a real number.** As in [[def-neighbourhood-r]], $\varepsilon$
  and $\delta$ range over the positive reals here. Restricting either quantifier
  to the positive rationals defines the same relation, by the passage recorded
  in [[def-function-limit]]: below every positive real lies a positive rational
  ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and a real $\delta$ may be shrunk to a rational
  one below it.

- **The word *continuous* is used for two things in this library, and they
  agree.** [[def-metric-continuity]] defines continuity of a map between metric
  spaces, and $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ carries the metric $d(x,y) = |x-y|$. The
  two notions coincide, and that is proved, not assumed:
  [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]] is the dictionary, and it is stated on
  this page precisely so that no later item has to guess.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]] and closure as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]].

- $x$ is an **adherent point** of $A$ when $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne
  \varnothing$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$.
- $x$ is a **limit point** (or *accumulation point*) of $A$ when
  $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every real
  $\varepsilon > 0$: every punctured neighbourhood of $x$ meets $A$.
- $x$ is an **isolated point** of $A$ when $x \in A$ and there is a real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$.
- The **derived set** of $A$ is
  $$A' \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \text{ is a limit point of } A \,\}.$$
- $A$ is **dense in $\mathbb{R}$** when $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$.

**A limit point is an adherent point**, since $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq
N_\varepsilon(x)$; and an element of $A$ is an adherent point of $A$, since
$x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). So the adherent
points of $A$ are exactly the points of $A \cup A'$, a statement proved as part
of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

**Limit point and isolated point are exact opposites inside $A$.** For
$x \in A$: $x$ is an isolated point of $A$ exactly when it is not a limit point
of $A$. Indeed $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$ says precisely that
$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, because $x$ itself always lies in
$N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ when $x \in A$; so the existence of an $\varepsilon$
witnessing isolation is the negation of the condition defining a limit point.
A point of $A$ is therefore either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$, and
never both.

**A limit point need not belong to the set, and a point of the set need not be a
limit point.** Both possibilities occur, and the two examples that matter later
are $0$, which is a limit point of $\{\, 1/k : k \ge 1 \,\}$ without belonging
to it, and $0$ again, which belongs to $\{0\} \cup [1,2]$ as an isolated point.

## Remarks

- **Terminology: *limit point* here is about a set, never about a sequence.**
  This library reserves *subsequential limit* for the sequential notion
  ([[def-subsequential-limit]]), and the two are genuinely different: the
  constant sequence $x_k = 0$ has $0$ as a subsequential limit, while its set of
  values $\{0\}$ has no limit point at all. The distinction is the one
  [[def-subsequential-limit]] records under "Terminology", and it is respected
  throughout this page.

- **Density is defined through the closure, not through intervals.** Saying
  $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$ is equivalent to saying that every nonempty open
  subset of $\mathbb{R}$ meets $A$, and also to saying that every neighbourhood
  of every real meets $A$; the equivalences follow from
  [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] and are used in that form in
  [[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]].

- **The derived set need not be comparable with the set.** It can be strictly
  larger, as for $\mathbb{Q}$: every punctured neighbourhood of any real
  contains a rational, since density supplies one strictly between $x$ and
  $x + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]), so the derived set of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is all of $\mathbb{R}$. It can be strictly smaller, as for
  $\{0\}$, whose derived set is empty; and it can be neither, as for
  $\{0\} \cup (1,2)$, whose derived set is $[1,2]$, a set containing points
  outside the original and omitting the point $0$ of it. A closed set satisfying
  $A \subseteq A'$ is called perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]).

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]). Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and let
$f : A \to \mathbb{R}$. Then $f$ is:

- **nondecreasing** when $f(x) \le f(y)$ for all $x, y \in A$ with $x \le y$;
- **increasing**, or *strictly increasing*, when $f(x) < f(y)$ for all
  $x, y \in A$ with $x < y$;
- **nonincreasing** when $f(x) \ge f(y)$ for all $x, y \in A$ with $x \le y$;
- **decreasing**, or *strictly decreasing*, when $f(x) > f(y)$ for all
  $x, y \in A$ with $x < y$;
- **monotone** when it is nondecreasing or nonincreasing;
- **strictly monotone** when it is increasing or decreasing.

The naming follows the convention of [[def-monotone-sequence]], which is the
convention of this library throughout: *increasing* is the strict notion and
*nondecreasing* the weak one.

**An increasing function is nondecreasing, and a decreasing function is
nonincreasing.** For $x \le y$ either $x < y$, and then $f(x) < f(y)$, hence
$f(x) \le f(y)$; or $x = y$, and then $f(x) = f(y)$. The same argument with the
inequalities reversed gives the second claim. So strictly monotone implies
monotone.

**A strictly monotone function is injective**
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]). Let $f$ be increasing and let
$x, y \in A$ with $x \ne y$. By trichotomy either $x < y$, and then
$f(x) < f(y)$, or $y < x$, and then $f(y) < f(x)$; in both cases
$f(x) \ne f(y)$. The decreasing case is the same argument. The converse fails,
and the failure is not exotic: a continuous injection on an interval *is*
strictly monotone ([[thm-continuous-injection-on-an-interval-is-strictly-monotone]]),
but on a domain that is not an interval it need not be.

**Negation exchanges the two directions.** For $g := -f$, that is
$g(x) := -f(x)$, the four conditions above are exchanged in pairs: $f$ is
nondecreasing exactly when $g$ is nonincreasing, and $f$ is increasing exactly
when $g$ is decreasing, because $u \le v$ holds exactly when $-v \le -u$
([[def-ordered-field]]). Several proofs below use this to reduce a nonincreasing
case to a nondecreasing one.

**Monotone on a set, not at a point.** All six conditions are conditions on the
whole of $A$; unlike continuity ([[def-continuity-real]]) there is no pointwise
version, and none is used in this library. The domain $A$ is an arbitrary subset
of $\mathbb{R}$; where a result needs $A$ to be an interval
([[def-interval]]) it says so, and the hypothesis is never decoration.

### The dictionary to monotone sequences

A sequence of reals is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$
([[def-sequence]]), and [[def-monotone-sequence]] calls it nondecreasing when
$x_j \le x_k$ for all $j \le k$, increasing when $x_j < x_k$ for all $j < k$,
and so on. Those are **the same four conditions as above**, read with the
ordered set $\mathbb{N}$ in place of the ordered subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$
and with the comparison of indices in place of the comparison of arguments. So
nothing new is introduced here for sequences, and the two vocabularies may be
used interchangeably: the words *nondecreasing*, *increasing*, *nonincreasing*,
*decreasing*, *monotone* and *strictly monotone* mean the corresponding
condition on the domain at hand.

One consequence is used repeatedly, and it has to be stated carefully because
composition does **not** simply preserve the four words. Let $(x_k)$ be a
**nondecreasing** sequence with $x_k \in A$ for every $k$, so that $j \le k$ gives
$x_j \le x_k$. Then:

- if $f$ is nondecreasing, $(f(x_k))$ is nondecreasing, since $f(x_j) \le f(x_k)$;
- if $f$ is nonincreasing, $(f(x_k))$ is **nonincreasing**, since
  $f(x_j) \ge f(x_k)$.

So along a nondecreasing sequence the composite inherits the direction of $f$;
and with $(x_k)$ increasing and $f$ increasing, $(f(x_k))$ is increasing, while
with $(x_k)$ increasing and $f$ decreasing, $(f(x_k))$ is decreasing.

**Along a nonincreasing sequence the direction is reversed, not inherited.** If
$(x_k)$ is nonincreasing and $f$ is nonincreasing, then $j \le k$ gives
$x_j \ge x_k$ and hence $f(x_j) \le f(x_k)$: the composite is **nondecreasing**.
The witness is $f(x) = -x$ on $A = \mathbb{R}$ with $x_k = -k$, where both $f$ and
$(x_k)$ are decreasing and $f(x_k) = k$ is increasing. Two order-reversing maps
compose to an order-preserving one, exactly as for the four words applied to
functions.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in
\mathbb{R}$. Put

$$A^{-} := A \cap (-\infty, c), \qquad A^{+} := A \cap (c, \infty)$$

([[def-interval]]), and write $f^{-} := f|_{A^{-}}$ and $f^{+} := f|_{A^{+}}$
for the restrictions of $f$ to those sets.

**Right limit.** Suppose $c$ is a limit point of $A^{+}$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]).
For $L \in \mathbb{R}$ we write

$$\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x) = L \quad :\Longleftrightarrow \quad \lim_{x \to c} f^{+}(x) = L$$

in the sense of [[def-function-limit]]. Written out: for every real
$\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that

$$|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon \qquad \text{for every } x \in A \text{ with } c < x < c + \delta .$$

**Left limit.** Suppose $c$ is a limit point of $A^{-}$. For $L \in \mathbb{R}$
we write $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) = L$ when $\lim_{x \to c} f^{-}(x) = L$; written
out, for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ with
$|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ for every $x \in A$ with $c - \delta < x < c$.

**The written-out forms agree with the definitions.** For $x \in A^{+}$ the two
conditions $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ and $c < x < c + \delta$ are the same: $x > c$
gives $x - c > 0$, so $|x - c| = x - c$ and $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ reads
$0 < x - c < \delta$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]). Symmetrically on the left, where
$x < c$ gives $|x - c| = c - x$.

**Well-posedness is inherited, not reproved.** A one-sided limit *is* a limit,
namely the limit of a restriction, so:

- **Uniqueness.** At most one $L$ can occur, by [[lem-function-limit-unique]]
  applied to $f^{+}$ on the domain $A^{+}$ (respectively to $f^{-}$ on
  $A^{-}$), which is legitimate exactly because $c$ was required to be a limit
  point of that set. This is what makes the notation $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$
  denote a single real.
- **Locality and restriction.** Both claims of [[lem-limit-is-local]] apply
  verbatim to $f^{+}$ and $f^{-}$.

**When the symbols are defined.** If $c$ is not a limit point of $A^{+}$ — for
instance if $A$ contains no point to the right of $c$, or only points bounded
away from $c$ on that side — then $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$ is **not defined**
here, for the reason given in [[def-function-limit]]: the
$\varepsilon$-$\delta$ condition would be satisfied vacuously by every real at
once. The same applies on the left.

## Remarks

- **Neither one-sided limit requires $c \in A$, and neither looks at $f(c)$.**
  Both properties are inherited from [[def-function-limit]], since $c \notin
  A^{-} \cup A^{+}$: the point $c$ belongs to neither $(-\infty, c)$ nor
  $(c, \infty)$.

- **The two one-sided limits and the two-sided limit.** When $c$ is a limit
  point of both $A^{-}$ and $A^{+}$, the two-sided limit exists exactly when
  both one-sided limits exist and agree, and then all three coincide:
  [[thm-two-sided-limit-iff-both-one-sided]]. When $c$ is a limit point of only
  one of the two sets, that one-sided limit and the two-sided limit are the same
  condition, again by claim 2 of [[lem-limit-is-local]] together with the
  observation that $A$ and that one side have the same points in a small enough
  punctured neighbourhood of $c$.

- **Notation.** Some texts write $f(c+)$ and $f(c-)$ for these values. This
  library writes only $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$ and $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x)$,
  because the shorter notation looks like an evaluation of $f$ and these
  quantities are not values of $f$: they are defined without reference to
  $f(c)$, which may not even exist.

## Statement

Let $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be order-convex ([[def-interval]]) and let
$f : I \to \mathbb{R}$ be monotone ([[def-monotone-function]]). Then the set

$$D \;:=\; \{\, c \in I : f \text{ is discontinuous at } c \,\}$$

([[def-classification-of-discontinuities]]) is **at most countable**
([[def-countable]]).

More precisely, the proof exhibits an injection $J : D \to \mathbb{N}$
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]) built from one fixed enumeration of the
rationals: at a discontinuity $c$ interior to $I$ the value $J(c)$ is read off
the **least index** of a rational lying in the gap
$\bigl(\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x),\ \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)\bigr)$, which is a
nonempty open interval by [[thm-monotone-discontinuities-are-jumps]]. The map
$J$ is therefore determined by $f$ and by the fixed enumeration, and **no choice
principle is used**: least indices are canonical by
[[thm-well-ordering-principle]], and nothing anywhere in the proof is selected
without being determined.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An order-convex $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a monotone $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$; and $\mathbb{Q}$ denotes the canonical copy of the rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$.

[A1] $I$ is order-convex: $x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$ imply $z \in I$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L1] A nondecreasing $f$ on an order-convex $I$ has, at every $c \in I$, each well-posed one-sided limit; and if both $I^{-} = I \cap (-\infty,c)$ and $I^{+} = I \cap (c,\infty)$ are nonempty then $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) = \sup\{f(x) : x \in I, x < c\}$ and $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x) = \inf\{f(x) : x \in I, x > c\}$ ([[thm-monotone-one-sided-limits-exist]]).

[L2] For a nondecreasing $f$ on an order-convex $I$ and a point $c$ with both $I^{-}$ and $I^{+}$ nonempty, $f$ is discontinuous at $c$ if and only if $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) < \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$ ([[thm-monotone-discontinuities-are-jumps]]).

[L3] $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-rationals-countable]]) and the map $q \mapsto \hat q$ embeds $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ injectively ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), so composing a bijection $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$ with that embedding gives a bijection $e : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ onto the canonical copy of the rationals inside $\mathbb{R}$; and strictly between any two distinct reals there lies a point of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]], [[def-equinumerous]], [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L4] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L5] Every subset of $\mathbb{N}$ is at most countable, and a set in bijection with an at most countable set is at most countable ([[lem-subset-of-countable]], [[def-countable]], [[def-equinumerous]], [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L6] $f$ is discontinuous at $c$ exactly when it is not continuous there, and $|(-f)(x) - (-f)(c)| = |f(x) - f(c)|$, so $f$ and $-f$ have exactly the same points of discontinuity ([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-monotone-function]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 It is enough to treat a nondecreasing $f$: if $f$ is nonincreasing then $-f$ is nondecreasing and has the same discontinuity set, so the conclusion for $-f$ is the conclusion for $f$. Assume from here on that $f$ is nondecreasing. [L6]

1.2 Fix once and for all a bijection $e : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$; everything below is defined in terms of $f$, $I$ and this one function. [L3, choose]

1.3 Call $c \in I$ **interior** when both $I^{-}$ and $I^{+}$ are nonempty, and write $D_{0}$ for the set of interior points of $I$ at which $f$ is discontinuous. A point of $I$ that is not interior has $I^{-} = \varnothing$, and is then a least element of $I$, or $I^{+} = \varnothing$, and is then a greatest element of $I$; a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has at most one least and at most one greatest element, so $D \setminus D_{0}$ has at most two elements. [A1]

2.1 For $c \in D_{0}$ put $L^{-}(c) := \lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x)$ and $L^{+}(c) := \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$, both of which exist, and note $L^{-}(c) < L^{+}(c)$. [step 1.3, L1, L2]

2.2 Let $c, c' \in D_{0}$ with $c < c'$. Take $t := e(k)$ for the least $k$ with $c < e(k) < c'$, which exists because a point of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ lies strictly between $c$ and $c'$; then $t \in I$, since $c, c' \in I$ and $I$ is order-convex. [step 1.3, A1, L3, L4]

3.1 For $c \in D_{0}$ the set $K(c) := \{\, k \in \mathbb{N} : L^{-}(c) < e(k) < L^{+}(c) \,\}$ is nonempty, since a point of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ lies strictly between the two distinct reals $L^{-}(c)$ and $L^{+}(c)$ and $e$ is onto $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$; so $j(c) := \min K(c)$ is a well-defined natural number, determined by $c$, $f$ and $e$ alone. [step 2.1, L3, L4]

3.2 With $c < t < c'$ as in step 2.2: $L^{+}(c) = \inf\{f(x) : x \in I, x > c\} \le f(t)$ because $t$ is one of the points in that set, and $f(t) \le \sup\{f(x) : x \in I, x < c'\} = L^{-}(c')$ for the same reason on the other side. Hence $L^{+}(c) \le L^{-}(c')$. [step 2.2, L1]

4.1 The two open intervals $(L^{-}(c), L^{+}(c))$ and $(L^{-}(c'), L^{+}(c'))$ are therefore disjoint, so no point of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ lies in both, so $e(j(c)) \ne e(j(c'))$ and hence $j(c) \ne j(c')$. Since $c < c'$ was an arbitrary pair of distinct elements of $D_{0}$, the map $j : D_{0} \to \mathbb{N}$ is injective. [step 3.1, step 3.2]

5.1 Define $J : D \to \mathbb{N}$ by $J(c) := 2\,j(c) + 1$ for $c \in D_{0}$; $J(c) := 0$ if $c \in D \setminus D_{0}$ is a least element of $I$; and $J(c) := 2$ if $c \in D \setminus D_{0}$ is a greatest element of $I$ and not a least one. Then $J$ is injective: it is injective on $D_{0}$ by step 4.1, it separates the at most two points of $D \setminus D_{0}$ from each other, and its values on $D_{0}$ are odd while its values off $D_{0}$ are even. [step 1.3, step 4.1, construct]

6.1 Consequently $J$ is a bijection from $D$ onto the subset $J[D] \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, which is at most countable; countability transfers along that bijection, so $D$ is at most countable. [step 5.1, L5] ∎

## Remarks

- **The bound is attained.** Froda's theorem gives no better bound than *at most countable*, and none is available: for every at most countable $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ there is a bounded nondecreasing function on $\mathbb{R}$ whose discontinuity set is exactly $E$ ([[thm-monotone-with-prescribed-discontinuity-set]]). Taking $E = \mathbb{Q}$ gives a nondecreasing function discontinuous at every rational and continuous at every irrational.

- **What the choice-freedom rests on.** Two canonical selections, and nothing else: one fixed bijection $e : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$, produced by [[thm-rationals-countable]], whose own proof spends no choice principle; and the least element of a nonempty set of naturals ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]). Replacing "least index" by "some index" would turn step 3.1 into an application of a choice principle over the possibly uncountable index set $D_{0}$.

- **Monotonicity is doing all the work, not continuity of anything.** The only property of $f$ used after step 1.1 is the inequality $L^{+}(c) \le L^{-}(c')$ of step 3.2, which says that the gaps opened by distinct discontinuities are laid out in the same order as the discontinuities themselves and therefore do not overlap. A function that is not monotone can be discontinuous everywhere ([[thm-dirichlet-and-thomae-continuity-sets]]).

## Statement

Let $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be order-convex ([[def-interval]]), let
$f : I \to \mathbb{R}$ be nondecreasing ([[def-monotone-function]]) and let
$c \in I$. Write

$$I^{-} := I \cap (-\infty, c), \qquad I^{+} := I \cap (c, \infty)$$

([[def-one-sided-limits]]).

1. **Left.** If $I^{-} \ne \varnothing$ then $c$ is a limit point of $I^{-}$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), the set $\{\, f(x) : x \in I^{-} \,\}$ is nonempty
   and bounded above by $f(c)$, and
   $$\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) \;=\; \sup\{\, f(x) : x \in I,\ x < c \,\} \;\le\; f(c) .$$
2. **Right.** If $I^{+} \ne \varnothing$ then $c$ is a limit point of $I^{+}$,
   the set $\{\, f(x) : x \in I^{+} \,\}$ is nonempty and bounded below by
   $f(c)$, and
   $$\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x) \;=\; \inf\{\, f(x) : x \in I,\ x > c \,\} \;\ge\; f(c) .$$
3. **Together.** If both $I^{-}$ and $I^{+}$ are nonempty then
   $$\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) \;\le\; f(c) \;\le\; \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x) .$$

In particular a nondecreasing function on an interval has, at every point of
that interval, every one-sided limit that is well posed at all: no hypothesis of
continuity, of boundedness, or of any other kind is needed.

**The nonincreasing case is not a separate theorem.** If $g : I \to \mathbb{R}$
is nonincreasing then $-g$ is nondecreasing ([[def-monotone-function]]), and a
real $L$ is the left limit of $-g$ at $c$ exactly when $-L$ is the left limit of
$g$ at $c$, since $|(-g)(x) - L| = |g(x) - (-L)|$; so claims 1 to 3 hold for $g$
with the suprema and infima exchanged and the inequalities reversed.

**Order-convexity of $I$ is what makes the limits well posed.** Without it the
symbol $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x)$ need not be defined even though $I^{-}$ is
nonempty: for $I = \{0\} \cup [1,2]$ and $c = 1$ the set $I^{-} = \{0\}$ is
nonempty but $1$ is not a limit point of it, and [[def-one-sided-limits]] leaves
the symbol undefined there for exactly that reason.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An order-convex $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a nondecreasing $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$, and $c \in I$.

[A1] $f(x) \le f(y)$ for all $x, y \in I$ with $x \le y$ ([[def-monotone-function]]).

[A2] $I$ is order-convex: $x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$ imply $z \in I$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L1] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound, and every nonempty subset bounded below has a greatest lower bound ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-bounded-set]], [[def-infimum]], [[thm-infimum-property]]).

[L2] For $S$ nonempty and bounded above with upper bound $u$: $u = \sup S$ if and only if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $s \in S$ with $u - \varepsilon < s$ ([[lem-sup-epsilon]]). Dually, for $S$ nonempty and bounded below with lower bound $\ell$: $\ell = \inf S$ if and only if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $s \in S$ with $s < \ell + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-inf-epsilon]]).

[L3] $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) = L$ means: $c$ is a limit point of $I^{-}$, and for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ with $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ for every $x \in I$ with $c - \delta < x < c$; dually on the right ([[def-one-sided-limits]], [[def-function-limit]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L4] $x$ is a limit point of a set $S$ when every punctured neighbourhood of $x$ meets $S$ ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]); a one-sided limit, being the limit of a restriction, is unique when it exists ([[lem-function-limit-unique]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Suppose $I^{-} \ne \varnothing$ and fix $a \in I$ with $a < c$; then $[a,c] \subseteq I$, since any $z$ with $a \le z \le c$ lies in $I$. [A2]

1.2 Claim 2 is the same argument on the other side, and is written out here rather than deduced. Suppose $I^{+} \ne \varnothing$ and fix $b \in I$ with $c < b$; then $[c,b] \subseteq I$, and for real $\delta > 0$ the point $\min\{b, c + \delta/2\}$ lies in $I^{+}$ within $\delta$ of $c$, so $c$ is a limit point of $I^{+}$. [A2, L4]

2.1 Every real $\delta > 0$ gives a point of $I^{-}$ within $\delta$ of $c$ and different from $c$: put $z := \max\{a, c - \delta/2\}$, so that $a \le z < c$ and $c - z \le \delta/2 < \delta$, and $z \in I$ by step 1.1. Hence $c$ is a limit point of $I^{-}$ and the symbol on the left of claim 1 is well posed. [step 1.1, L4]

2.2 The set $S^{-} := \{\, f(x) : x \in I,\ x < c \,\}$ is nonempty, since $f(a) \in S^{-}$, and $f(c)$ is an upper bound of it, since $x < c$ gives $f(x) \le f(c)$. So $L := \sup S^{-}$ exists and $L \le f(c)$, the latter because $f(c)$ is an upper bound and $L$ is the least one. [step 1.1, A1, L1]

2.3 The set $S^{+} := \{\, f(x) : x \in I,\ x > c \,\}$ is nonempty and bounded below by $f(c)$, so $M := \inf S^{+}$ exists and $M \ge f(c)$. [step 1.2, A1, L1]

3.1 Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real. By the epsilon characterisation of the supremum there is $x_0 \in I$ with $x_0 < c$ and $L - \varepsilon < f(x_0)$. [step 2.2, L2]

3.2 Given real $\varepsilon > 0$, the epsilon characterisation of the infimum gives $x_1 \in I$ with $x_1 > c$ and $f(x_1) < M + \varepsilon$; put $\delta := x_1 - c > 0$. For $x \in I$ with $c < x < c + \delta$ we have $c < x < x_1$, so $M \le f(x) \le f(x_1) < M + \varepsilon$ and hence $|f(x) - M| < \varepsilon$. [step 2.3, A1, L2]

4.1 Put $\delta := c - x_0 > 0$ and let $x \in I$ satisfy $c - \delta < x < c$. Then $x_0 < x < c$, so $f(x_0) \le f(x)$ by monotonicity and $f(x) \le L$ because $f(x) \in S^{-}$ and $L$ is an upper bound of $S^{-}$; hence $L - \varepsilon < f(x_0) \le f(x) \le L$ and therefore $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$. [step 2.2, step 3.1, A1]

4.2 Claim 2 is proved: $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x) = M = \inf S^{+} \ge f(c)$. [step 1.2, step 2.3, step 3.2, L3, L4]

5.1 Claim 1 is proved: $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary in step 3.1, so $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) = L = \sup S^{-} \le f(c)$, and this value is the only one the symbol can denote. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 4.1, L3, L4]

6.1 Claim 3 follows by combining the two inequalities of claims 1 and 2, both of which are then available. [step 5.1, step 4.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where completeness is spent.** Exactly once on each side, in the existence of $\sup S^{-}$ and of $\inf S^{+}$; the rest of the proof is the definition of a one-sided limit and the monotonicity hypothesis. Over an ordered field that is not complete the statement fails, because the supremum need not exist.

- **The two one-sided limits need not agree, and that is the point.** When both are defined they satisfy $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) \le f(c) \le \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x)$, and a strict inequality between the outer two is exactly a jump discontinuity; [[thm-monotone-discontinuities-are-jumps]] turns that observation into the classification of the discontinuities of a monotone function, and [[thm-froda]] counts them.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in
\mathbb{R}$ be a limit point of **both** $A^{-} = A \cap (-\infty, c)$ and
$A^{+} = A \cap (c, \infty)$ ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-interval]]), so that
both one-sided limits at $c$ are well posed ([[def-one-sided-limits]]). Then $c$
is a limit point of $A$, and for every $L \in \mathbb{R}$:

$$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) = L \ \text{ and } \ \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x) = L$$

([[def-function-limit]]). Consequently the limit of $f$ at $c$ **exists** if and
only if both one-sided limits exist and are equal, and in that case

$$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) \;=\; \lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) \;=\; \lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x) .$$

**The hypothesis on both sides is what makes the statement an equivalence.** If
$c$ is a limit point of only one of the two sets — as $1$ is for
$\{0\} \cup [1,2]$ — then the one-sided limit on that side and the two-sided
limit are the same condition, and the symbol on the other side is not defined at
all ([[def-one-sided-limits]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $c$ that is a limit point of both $A^{-} = A \cap (-\infty, c)$ and $A^{+} = A \cap (c, \infty)$, and a real $L$ ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-interval]], [[def-one-sided-limits]]).

[L1] The limit condition ([[def-function-limit]]): $\lim_{x \to c} h(x) = L$ means that for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x$ in the domain of $h$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|h(x) - L| < \varepsilon$.

[L2] Limit point: $c$ is a limit point of $S$ when for every real $\delta > 0$ there is $x \in S$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] Intervals: $A^{-} = \{\, x \in A : x < c \,\}$ and $A^{+} = \{\, x \in A : x > c \,\}$ ([[def-interval]]).

[L4] Absolute value and order: $|x - c| = 0$ exactly when $x = c$; the order is total, so every $x \ne c$ satisfies $x < c$ or $x > c$; and $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ is equivalent to $c - \delta < x < c$ for $x < c$ and to $c < x < c + \delta$ for $x > c$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]]). Of two positive reals the smaller is positive.

[L5] Restriction: if $B \subseteq A$ has $c$ as a limit point and $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$, then $\lim_{x \to c} f|_B(x) = L$ (claim 2 of [[lem-limit-is-local]]).

[L6] One-sided limits are by definition the limits of the restrictions $f|_{A^{-}}$ and $f|_{A^{+}}$ at $c$ ([[def-one-sided-limits]]).

[L7] At a limit point of its domain a function has at most one limit ([[lem-function-limit-unique]]); applied to $f|_{A^{-}}$ and to $f|_{A^{+}}$ it makes each one-sided limit a single real, and applied to $f$ it does the same for the two-sided limit.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $c$ is a limit point of $A$: it is one of $A^{+}$ by hypothesis, and $A^{+} \subseteq A$, so every point of $A^{+}$ found in a punctured neighbourhood of $c$ is a point of $A$ there. [L2, L3]

1.2 For $x \in A$ the condition $0 < |x - c|$ says exactly $x \ne c$, and then $x < c$ or $x > c$, that is $x \in A^{-}$ or $x \in A^{+}$; moreover for $x \in A^{-}$ the condition $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ reads $c - \delta < x < c$ and for $x \in A^{+}$ it reads $c < x < c + \delta$. [L3, L4]

2.1 Suppose $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$. Both $A^{-}$ and $A^{+}$ are subsets of $A$ having $c$ as a limit point, so [L5] gives $\lim_{x \to c} f|_{A^{-}}(x) = L$ and $\lim_{x \to c} f|_{A^{+}}(x) = L$, which by [L6] is exactly $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} f(x) = L$ and $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} f(x) = L$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L5, L6]

2.2 Suppose conversely that both one-sided limits equal $L$, and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary real. By [L6] and [L1] fix reals $\delta_1, \delta_2 > 0$ such that every $x \in A^{-}$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta_1$ and every $x \in A^{+}$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta_2$ satisfies $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$; let $\delta$ be the smaller of the two. Every $x \in A$ with $0 < |x - c| < \delta$ lies in $A^{-}$ or in $A^{+}$ by step 1.2, and in either case $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$. As $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary, $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$. [step 1.2, L1, L4, L6, choose]

3.1 The displayed equivalence is steps 2.1 and 2.2. For the consequence: if the limit of $f$ at $c$ exists, say with value $L$, then step 2.1 gives that both one-sided limits exist with the same value $L$, so they agree; and if both one-sided limits exist and are equal, to the common value $L$, then step 2.2 gives that the limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and equals $L$. Each of the three symbols denotes a single real by [L7], so the three are equal. [step 2.1, step 2.2, L7] ∎

## Remarks

- **The two directions are not symmetric in difficulty.** From the two-sided limit to the one-sided ones is pure restriction, [[lem-limit-is-local]]; the converse has to glue two estimates, and the gluing is legitimate precisely because every point of $A$ other than $c$ lies strictly on one side of $c$, which is the totality of the order.

- **The typical failure** is a function whose two one-sided limits exist and differ: the sign function at $0$, on the companion page. Then the two-sided limit cannot exist, since by step 2.1 it would force both one-sided values to equal it.

- **A function may also have no two-sided limit for a different reason**, namely that a one-sided limit fails to exist rather than that the two disagree. The theorem covers that case too, since its right-hand side asserts the existence of both one-sided values, so its failure on one side alone already blocks the two-sided limit. The companion page exhibits both patterns.
