## Statement

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$ and let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be of
Baire class one ([[def-baire-class-one]]). Write

$$D \;:=\; \{\, x \in [a,b] : f \text{ is discontinuous at } x \,\}, \qquad C := [a,b] \setminus D$$

([[def-continuity-real]]). Then:

1. for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the set
   $D_\varepsilon := \{\, x \in [a,b] : \omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon \,\}$
   ([[def-oscillation]]) is a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}$ containing **no**
   nondegenerate closed interval, hence nowhere dense
   ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]]);
2. $D$ is meager, being the union of the sequence
   $(D_{1/\iota(n+1)})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of nowhere dense sets;
3. $C$ is dense in $[a,b]$: for every $x \in [a,b]$ and every real $\rho > 0$
   the set $[a,b] \cap N_\rho(x)$ contains a point of $C$;
4. $C = [a,b] \cap V$ for a $G_\delta$ subset $V \subseteq \mathbb{R}$
   ([[def-f-sigma-g-delta]]).

**On the phrase "dense $G_\delta$".** Claims 3 and 4 together are what the
classical statement calls a *dense $G_\delta$ subset of $[a,b]$*: the continuity
set is dense in $[a,b]$ and it is the trace on $[a,b]$ of a $G_\delta$ subset of
$\mathbb{R}$. It is not claimed that $C$ is $G_\delta$ as a subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, nor that it is dense in $\mathbb{R}$; neither is true in general,
since $C \subseteq [a,b]$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$, a function $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ of Baire class one, and a sequence $(f_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of continuous functions on $[a,b]$ converging pointwise to $f$.

[L1] $f$ of Baire class one on $[a,b]$ means: there are continuous $f_k : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ with $f_k(x) \to f(x)$ for every $x \in [a,b]$ ([[def-baire-class-one]], [[def-continuity-real]], [[def-real-limit]], [[def-sequence]]).

[L2] $\omega_f(S) = \sup\{|f(x)-f(y)| : x,y \in S\}$; $\omega_f(x) = \inf\{\omega_f([a,b] \cap N_\delta(x)) : \delta > 0\}$; $\omega_f$ is monotone under inclusion and $\omega_f(x) \ge 0$ ([[def-oscillation]]).

[L4] For every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a closed $G \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ with $\{x \in [a,b] : \omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon\} = [a,b] \cap G$ ([[lem-oscillation-superlevel-sets-are-closed]]).

[L5] If $a < b$, $(F_n)$ are closed and $[a,b] \subseteq \bigcup_n F_n$, then some $F_n \cap [a,b]$ contains a nondegenerate closed interval ([[lem-baire-category-in-a-closed-interval]]).

[L6] $[a,b]$ and every $[c,d]$ with $c \le d$ are closed; an intersection of a nonempty family of closed sets is closed; a set is closed exactly when its complement is open ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], claim 3, [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L7] For a continuous $h$ on $[a,b]$ and a closed $F \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, the preimage $\{x \in [a,b] : h(x) \in F\}$ is $G \cap [a,b]$ for some closed $G$ ([[thm-continuity-preimage-characterisation]]); differences and absolute values of continuous functions are continuous ([[thm-algebra-of-continuous-functions]]).

[L8] A closed set with empty interior is nowhere dense, and a union of a sequence of nowhere dense sets is meager ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]]).

[L9] The set of continuity points of $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is $A \cap V$ for a $G_\delta$ set $V \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, and the discontinuity set is $\{x \in A : \omega_f(x) > 0\} = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \{x \in A : \omega_f(x) \ge 1/\iota(n+1)\}$ ([[thm-discontinuity-set-is-f-sigma]], claims 1 and 2, [[def-f-sigma-g-delta]]).

[L10] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $m \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(m) < \eta$; $\iota$ is positive on the naturals $\ge 1$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L11] $|u - w| \le |u - v| + |v - w|$, $|u| \ge 0$, and a real that is $\le \eta$ for every real $\eta > 0$ and $\ge 0$ is $0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L12] $\max$ and $\min$ of two reals exist; $N_\rho(x) = (x-\rho, x+\rho)$; a point interior to a set has a neighbourhood inside it ([[def-max-min]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Refinement claim.** Let $[c,d] \subseteq [a,b]$ with $c < d$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$ be real. For $N \in \mathbb{N}$ put $E_{N} := \{\, x \in [c,d] : |f_{n}(x) - f_{m}(x)| \le \varepsilon/4 \ \text{for all } n, m \ge N \,\}$. [L1, construct]

1.2 Claim 1. Fix a real $\varepsilon > 0$ and let $D_{\varepsilon} := \{x \in [a,b] : \omega_{f}(x) \ge \varepsilon\}$. It is closed in $\mathbb{R}$, being $[a,b] \cap G$ with $G$ closed and $[a,b]$ closed. [L4, L6]

1.3 Claim 4. The set of continuity points of $f$ on the domain $[a,b]$ is $[a,b] \cap V$ for a $G_\delta$ subset $V \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. [L9]

1.4 Claim 3. Let $x \in [a,b]$ and let $\rho > 0$ be real. The set $[a,b] \cap N_{\rho}(x)$ contains a nondegenerate closed interval $[c,d]$ with $c < d$, because $a < b$: taking $c := \max\{a,\ x - \rho/2\}$ and $d := \min\{b,\ x + \rho/2\}$ gives $[c,d] \subseteq [a,b] \cap N_{\rho}(x)$ and $c < d$: if $x = a$ then $c = a$ and $d = \min\{b, a + \rho/2\} > a$; if $x = b$ then $d = b$ and $c = \max\{a, b - \rho/2\} < b$; and if $a < x < b$ then $c < x < d$. [L12]

2.1 Each $E_{N}$ is closed: for fixed $n, m$ the set $\{x \in [c,d] : |f_{n}(x) - f_{m}(x)| \le \varepsilon/4\}$ is the preimage under the continuous function $|f_{n} - f_{m}|$ of the closed set $\{y : y \le \varepsilon/4\}$, hence of the form $G \cap [c,d]$ with $G$ closed, hence closed since $[c,d]$ is; and $E_{N}$ is the intersection of that nonempty family of closed sets over the pairs $n, m \ge N$. [step 1.1, L6, L7]

2.2 $[c,d] = \bigcup_{N \in \mathbb{N}} E_{N}$: for $x \in [c,d]$ the sequence $(f_{k}(x))$ converges to $f(x)$, so there is $N$ with $|f_{k}(x) - f(x)| < \varepsilon/8$ for all $k \ge N$, and then $|f_{n}(x) - f_{m}(x)| \le |f_{n}(x) - f(x)| + |f(x) - f_{m}(x)| < \varepsilon/4$ for all $n, m \ge N$. [step 1.1, L1, L11]

3.1 By the interval form of Baire category applied to $[c,d]$ and the sequence $(E_{N})$, there are $N \in \mathbb{N}$ and reals $u' < v'$ with $[u',v'] \subseteq E_{N} \cap [c,d] = E_{N}$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, L5]

4.1 For every $x \in [u',v']$ one has $|f_{N}(x) - f(x)| \le \varepsilon/4$. Indeed, let $\eta > 0$ be real; since $f_{m}(x) \to f(x)$ there is $m \ge N$ with $|f_{m}(x) - f(x)| < \eta$, and then $|f_{N}(x) - f(x)| \le |f_{N}(x) - f_{m}(x)| + |f_{m}(x) - f(x)| < \varepsilon/4 + \eta$; as $\eta > 0$ was arbitrary this gives $|f_{N}(x) - f(x)| \le \varepsilon/4$. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L1, L11]

4.2 Put $x_{0} := (u'+v')/2$, so $u' < x_{0} < v'$. Since $f_{N}$ is continuous at $x_{0}$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ with $|f_{N}(x) - f_{N}(x_{0})| < \varepsilon/4$ for every $x \in [a,b]$ with $|x - x_{0}| < \delta$. Put $u := \max\{u',\ x_{0} - \delta/2\}$ and $v := \min\{v',\ x_{0} + \delta/2\}$, so that $u < x_{0} < v$ and $[u,v] \subseteq [u',v']$ with $|x - x_{0}| < \delta$ for every $x \in [u,v]$. [step 3.1, L1, L12]

5.1 For $x, y \in [u,v]$: $|f(x) - f(y)| \le |f(x) - f_{N}(x)| + |f_{N}(x) - f_{N}(x_{0})| + |f_{N}(x_{0}) - f_{N}(y)| + |f_{N}(y) - f(y)| \le \varepsilon/4 + \varepsilon/4 + \varepsilon/4 + \varepsilon/4 = \varepsilon$. Hence $\omega_{f}([u,v]) \le \varepsilon$, $\varepsilon$ being an upper bound of the set whose supremum that is. [step 4.1, step 4.2, L2, L11]

6.1 **The refinement claim is proved:** for every $[c,d] \subseteq [a,b]$ with $c < d$ and every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there are $u < v$ with $[u,v] \subseteq [c,d]$ and $\omega_{f}([u,v]) \le \varepsilon$. Moreover every $x$ with $u < x < v$ satisfies $\omega_{f}(x) \le \varepsilon$, since $[a,b] \cap N_{\rho}(x) \subseteq [u,v]$ for $\rho := \min\{x-u,\ v-x\} > 0$ and $\omega_{f}$ is monotone under inclusion. [step 4.2, step 5.1, L2, L12]

7.1 $D_{\varepsilon}$ contains no nondegenerate closed interval. Were $[c,d] \subseteq D_{\varepsilon}$ with $c < d$, the refinement claim applied to $[c,d]$ and to the positive real $\varepsilon/2$ would give $u < v$ with $[u,v] \subseteq [c,d]$ and $\omega_{f}(x) \le \varepsilon/2 < \varepsilon$ for every $x$ with $u < x < v$; such an $x$ lies in $[c,d] \subseteq D_{\varepsilon}$ and so satisfies $\omega_{f}(x) \ge \varepsilon$, which is impossible. [step 6.1, step 1.2]

8.1 Hence $D_{\varepsilon}$ is nowhere dense: it is closed, so it equals its own closure, and its interior is empty, since an interior point would have a neighbourhood $N_{\rho}(x) \subseteq D_{\varepsilon}$ and then $[x - \rho/2,\ x + \rho/2]$ would be a nondegenerate closed interval inside $D_{\varepsilon}$. [step 1.2, step 7.1, L8, L12]

9.1 Claim 2. $D = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} D_{1/\iota(n+1)}$, and each $D_{1/\iota(n+1)}$ is nowhere dense by step 8.1, so $D$ is a union of a sequence of nowhere dense sets, that is, meager. [step 8.1, L8, L9, L10]

10.1 Suppose $[c,d] \subseteq D$ with $c < d$ as in step 1.4. Then $[c,d]$ is covered by the sequence $(D_{1/\iota(n+1)})$ of closed sets, so by the interval form of Baire category some $D_{1/\iota(n+1)} \cap [c,d]$ contains a nondegenerate closed interval, contradicting step 7.1. So $[c,d] \not\subseteq D$, and any point of $[c,d] \setminus D$ is a point of $C$ inside $[a,b] \cap N_{\rho}(x)$. [step 7.1, step 9.1, step 1.4, L5, L6]

11.1 Claims 1, 2, 3 and 4 are therefore proved: claim 1 by steps 1.2, 7.1 and 8.1, claim 2 by step 9.1, claim 3 by steps 1.4 and 10.1, and claim 4 by step 1.3. [step 8.1, step 9.1, step 1.3, step 10.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the hypothesis of Baire class one is used.** The hypothesis enters through the approximating sequence fixed in step 1.1. Pointwise convergence is used in steps 2.2 and 4.1, and continuity of the approximants is used in steps 2.1 and 4.2. These facts establish the refinement claim in step 6.1. From step 7.1 onward the proof uses only that claim, oscillation, and category.

- **The conclusion is sharp in the sense that "meager" cannot be improved to "at most countable".** The theorem constrains the discontinuity set by category, not by cardinality. Nothing above bounds the size of $D$; a meager set can be uncountable, the Cantor set being one ([[thm-cantor-set-properties]]), so the theorem leaves open how large a discontinuity set a Baire class one function may have. What it does exclude outright is a Baire class one function on $[0,1]$ that is nowhere continuous, and the companion page spends exactly that on the Dirichlet function.

- **The dense set is not claimed to be uncountable, and no measure statement is made.** Meagerness is a statement about category alone ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]]); nothing above bears on the measure of $D$, and the two notions of smallness are independent, as [[cor-q-is-meager-and-not-g-delta]] and the fat Cantor set already record.

## Statement

Let $F$ be a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and let
$\varepsilon \in F$ with $\varepsilon > 0$. Then there is a natural number
$n \ge 1$ such that

$$\frac{1}{n \cdot 1_F} < \varepsilon ,$$

where $n \cdot 1_F$ is the canonical natural of $F$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]]) and
$1/(n \cdot 1_F)$ is its multiplicative inverse ([[def-field]]). As is standard
we abbreviate $n \cdot 1_F$ to $n$ and write the conclusion $1/n < \varepsilon$.

This is the **reciprocal form** of the Archimedean property.
[[thm-of-archimedean]] on its own delivers only the assertion that the canonical
naturals are cofinal, $x < n \cdot 1_F$; the form actually used in analysis, that
the reciprocals of the naturals get below every positive bound, is the statement
above, and it is recorded separately so that no proof has to reconstruct the
inversion step in passing.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A complete ordered field $F$ and an element $\varepsilon \in F$ with $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] Archimedean property: for every $x \in F$ there is a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $x < n \cdot 1_F$ ([[thm-of-archimedean]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

[L2] Inverses and order: if $a > 0$ then $a^{-1} > 0$, and if $0 < a < b$ then $0 < b^{-1} < a^{-1}$ ([[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Field arithmetic: an element $a$ with $a > 0$ is nonzero by trichotomy, hence has a multiplicative inverse $a^{-1}$, and $(a^{-1})^{-1} = a$ ([[def-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Since $\varepsilon > 0$, trichotomy gives $\varepsilon \ne 0$, so $\varepsilon^{-1}$ exists, and $\varepsilon^{-1} > 0$. [given, L2, L3]

2.1 Apply [L1] to $x = \varepsilon^{-1}$: fix a natural number $n \ge 1$ with $\varepsilon^{-1} < n \cdot 1_F$. [step 1.1, L1, choose]

3.1 Chaining the two displayed inequalities gives $0 < \varepsilon^{-1} < n \cdot 1_F$; in particular $n \cdot 1_F > 0$, so $n \cdot 1_F \ne 0$ and $1/(n \cdot 1_F)$ is defined. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L3]

4.1 Apply the second claim of [L2] with $a = \varepsilon^{-1}$ and $b = n \cdot 1_F$: $0 < (n \cdot 1_F)^{-1} < (\varepsilon^{-1})^{-1}$. [step 3.1, L2]

5.1 By [L3], $(\varepsilon^{-1})^{-1} = \varepsilon$, so the natural number $n \ge 1$ fixed in step 2.1 satisfies $1/(n \cdot 1_F) < \varepsilon$, which is the assertion. [step 4.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Monotonicity gives the eventual form for free.** If $m \ge n \ge 1$ then
  $m \cdot 1_F \ge n \cdot 1_F > 0$, because $k \mapsto k \cdot 1_F$ is strictly
  increasing on the naturals $\ge 1$ ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]), and so
  $1/(m \cdot 1_F) \le 1/(n \cdot 1_F) < \varepsilon$ by [[lem-of-inverse-positive]]
  again. So the corollary yields not merely one index but a threshold: every
  $m \ge n$ satisfies $1/m < \varepsilon$. That one extra line is what a
  convergence proof needs, and it is left to the caller rather than folded into
  the statement, because the caller usually has a threshold of its own to combine
  it with.

- **Completeness is used only through [[thm-of-archimedean]].** Nothing here
  needs the least-upper-bound property directly. The corollary therefore holds
  verbatim in any Archimedean ordered field, in particular in $\mathbb{Q}$, and
  it fails in a non-Archimedean ordered field, where an infinitesimal
  $\varepsilon > 0$ is below every $1/n$ by construction.

- The equivalence is exact: the reciprocal form implies the cofinal form back
  again, since given $x > 0$ one applies it to $\varepsilon = 1/x$. The two are
  the same property written on the two sides of the inversion, and only the
  direction proved above is used in this library.

## Statement

Write $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the image of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$
under the canonical embedding $q \mapsto \hat q$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), the
set usually written $\mathbb{Q}$ once the identification is made, and put
$X := \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for the irrationals. Then:

1. $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is an $F_\sigma$ set ([[def-f-sigma-g-delta]]) and is
   meager ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]]);
2. $X$ is a $G_\delta$ set and is residual;
3. $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is **not** a $G_\delta$ set, and $X$ is **not** an
   $F_\sigma$ set.

Claims 1 and 2 are bookkeeping. Claim 3 is the substance and is exactly where
[[thm-baire-category-r]] is spent: no argument from the algebra of open and
closed sets alone can reach it, since $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and $X$ are
interchanged by complementation while $F_\sigma$ and $G_\delta$ are, so any such
argument would prove the same thing about both sets and about neither.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The complete ordered field $\mathbb{R}$, the set $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ of rationals and its complement $X = \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$.

[L1] $\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-rationals-countable]], [[def-equinumerous]]), $q \mapsto \hat q$ is injective with image $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and a composition of bijections is a bijection ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]).

[L2] $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]); a set is dense when its closure is $\mathbb{R}$, equivalently when every $N_\varepsilon(x)$ meets it ([[def-limit-point-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]); the closure operator is monotone, so a superset of a dense set is dense ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]).

[L3] $U$ is open when every point of it has a neighbourhood inside it, and $F$ is closed when $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open; $N_\varepsilon(x) = (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon)$ and $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L4] A closed set is nowhere dense exactly when its interior is empty; a meager set is a union of a sequence of nowhere dense sets; residual means the complement is meager ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]]).

[L5] $A$ is $F_\sigma$ when it is the union of a sequence of closed sets and $G_\delta$ when it is the intersection of a sequence of open sets; $A$ is $F_\sigma$ if and only if $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ is $G_\delta$ ([[def-f-sigma-g-delta]]).

[L6] A countable intersection of dense open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ is dense ([[thm-baire-category-r]]).

[L7] There is a bijection $J : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-n-cross-n-countable]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 For $c \in \mathbb{R}$ the singleton $\{c\}$ is closed and nowhere dense: its complement is open, since $x \ne c$ gives $N_{|x-c|}(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus \{c\}$ by [L3]; and its interior is empty, since for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ the point $c + \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}$ lies in $N_\varepsilon(c)$ and differs from $c$, so no neighbourhood is contained in $\{c\}$, whence $\{c\}$ is a closed set with empty interior and [L4] applies. [L3, L4]

1.2 By [L1] fix a bijection $\beta : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$ and put $e := \iota \circ \beta$ with $\iota(q) = \hat q$, a bijection from $\mathbb{N}$ onto $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$. [L1, choose]

2.1 $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \{e(n)\}$, since $e$ is onto $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$; the sets $\{e(n)\}$ are closed and nowhere dense by step 1.1, so $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is $F_\sigma$ by [L5] and meager by [L4]. This is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L4, L5]

3.1 Put $W_n := \mathbb{R} \setminus \{e(n)\}$, an open set by step 1.1 and [L3]. A real $x$ lies in $\bigcap_n W_n$ exactly when $x \ne e(n)$ for every $n$, that is, exactly when $x \notin \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, so $X = \bigcap_n W_n$ and $X$ is $G_\delta$ by [L5]; and $\mathbb{R} \setminus X = \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is meager by step 2.1, so $X$ is residual by [L4]. This is claim 2. Each $W_n$ is also dense, since every $N_\varepsilon(x)$ contains two distinct points and so meets $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{e(n)\}$, by [L2] and [L3]. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.1, L2, L3, L4, L5]

4.1 Suppose, for contradiction, that $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is $G_\delta$, and by [L5] fix a sequence $(V_n)$ of open sets with $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} = \bigcap_n V_n$. Each $V_n$ contains $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, which is dense by [L2], so each $V_n$ is dense by [L2]; and each $W_n$ of step 3.1 is open and dense. [assume-contra, step 3.1, L2, L5, choose]

5.1 By [L7] fix a bijection $J : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ and define a sequence $(D_j)$ by $D_{J(m,n)} := V_n$ when $m = 0$ and $D_{J(m,n)} := W_n$ when $m \ne 0$; this is total because $J$ is a bijection, and every $D_j$ is open and dense by step 4.1. Moreover $\bigcap_j D_j = \big(\bigcap_n V_n\big) \cap \big(\bigcap_n W_n\big) = \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}} \cap X = \varnothing$, since every $V_n$ and every $W_n$ occurs among the $D_j$ and every $D_j$ is one of them. [step 3.1, step 4.1, L7]

6.1 By [L6] the set $\bigcap_j D_j$ is dense, hence nonempty by [L2] and [L3], contradicting step 5.1. The assumption of step 4.1 is therefore untenable: $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is not $G_\delta$; and $X$ is not $F_\sigma$, since $\mathbb{R} \setminus X = \mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ would then be $G_\delta$ by [L5]. This is claim 3. [step 4.1, step 5.1, L2, L3, L5, L6, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Where the two halves of the argument part company.** Claim 1 is a listing argument: step 1.2 lists $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$, and step 1.1 shows that each real singleton is nowhere dense; claim 3 uses the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ through [[thm-nested-interval-property]], inside [[thm-baire-category-r]]. Indeed $\mathbb{Q}$ is a $G_\delta$ subset of itself, being the whole space, so no argument that ignores the ambient completeness can possibly give claim 3.

- **The irrationals are also uncountable** ([[cor-irrationals-uncountable]]), by a different and much cheaper argument that needs only the countability of $\mathbb{Q}$ and the uncountability of $\mathbb{R}$. Uncountability and being residual are independent properties: $\mathbb{Q}$ is meager and countable, the Cantor set is meager and uncountable ([[thm-cantor-set-properties]]), and $X$ is residual and uncountable.

- **The named witness for claim 3** is [[cex-irrationals-are-not-f-sigma]], and the false statement it refutes is [[fs-q-is-g-delta]]; the refutation is carried out here.

- **Meagre and measure zero are not the same smallness.** $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is both, but the two notions diverge as soon as one leaves the countable case: [[cex-meager-set-of-full-measure]] writes $\mathbb{R}$ as a meager set together with a set of measure zero, and the set of measure zero there is residual. So being residual, which is what claim 2 gives for $X$, carries no information at all about size in measure.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. A **sequence of functions on $A$** is a function
assigning to each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a function $f_n : A \to \mathbb{R}$; it is
written $(f_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$. As everywhere in this library $\mathbb{N}$
contains $0$, so the first term is $f_0$ ([[def-sequence]]).

**Pointwise convergence.** $(f_n)$ **converges pointwise on $A$** to
$f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ when, for every $x \in A$, the sequence of reals
$(f_n(x))_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges to $f(x)$ ([[def-real-limit]]); written
out, for every $x \in A$ and every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is
$N \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|f_n(x) - f(x)| < \varepsilon$ for every $n \ge N$.

**The limit function is unique.** A sequence of reals has at most one limit
([[lem-limit-unique]]), so if $(f_n)$ converges pointwise to $f$ and to $g$ then
$f(x) = g(x)$ for every $x \in A$, hence $f = g$. We may therefore speak of
*the* pointwise limit and write $f = \lim_n f_n$ pointwise.

**The index $N$ is allowed to depend on $x$, and that is the whole content of the
word *pointwise*.** No uniformity over $A$ is asserted anywhere below.

### Baire class one

$f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is of **Baire class one on $A$** when there is a sequence
$(f_n)$ of functions $A \to \mathbb{R}$, each continuous on $A$
([[def-continuity-real]]), converging pointwise on $A$ to $f$.

**Every continuous function is of Baire class one**, by the constant sequence
$f_n := f$, which converges pointwise to $f$ because a constant sequence of
reals converges to its value.

**The class is strictly larger than the continuous functions**, and it is
strictly smaller than the class of all functions. The first is visible already
on $A = [0,1]$ ([[def-interval]]): the indicator of a single point is of Baire
class one and is not continuous. The second is
[[thm-baire-one-continuity-points]], which shows that a Baire class one function
on a closed bounded interval has a dense set of continuity points, and the
companion page uses it to exhibit a function that is not of Baire class one.

**On the higher classes.** The pointwise limits of sequences of Baire class one
functions form what is classically called Baire class two, and the construction
iterates. No definition of the higher classes is given here and none is used;
where the phrase is needed below it is stated as "a pointwise limit of a
sequence of Baire class one functions", which is a condition already expressible
with the words above.

## Definition

Let $F$ be a field ([[def-field]]) with additive identity $0_F$ and
multiplicative identity $1_F$. Define
$\iota : \mathbb{N} \to F$ by recursion on $\mathbb{N}$
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[thm-recursion]]):

$$\iota(0) \;:=\; 0_F, \qquad \iota(n+1) \;:=\; \iota(n) + 1_F .$$

$\iota(n)$ is the **canonical natural** of $n$ in $F$. It is also written
$n \cdot 1_F$, and for $n \ge 1$ it is $1_F$ added to itself $n$ times.

**Why the notation is needed at all.** A natural number in this library is a von
Neumann natural, that is a set ([[def-natural-numbers]]), and a set is not an
element of $F$. So $1/n$, $n^{\alpha}$ and $x/n$ are not expressions of $F$ when
$n$ is a natural: what they mean is $1/\iota(n)$, $\iota(n)^{\alpha}$ and
$x/\iota(n)$. The map $\iota$ is what carries a counting number into the field,
and writing it is the whole reason a reader meets $1/\iota(k+1)$ where an
informal text would write $1/(k+1)$.

## Remarks

- **Where the index shift comes from.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
  ([[def-natural-numbers]]) and $\iota(0) = 0_F$, so $1/\iota(k)$ is undefined at
  $k = 0$. A family of reciprocals indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ is therefore written
  over $\iota(k+1)$, which is why the harmonic and telescoping families of this
  library run over $k+1$ rather than over $k$. This is bookkeeping, not a
  restriction: the values are the usual ones.

- **This definition records notation; the arithmetic is proved elsewhere.** That
  $\iota$ is strictly increasing and positive on $n \ge 1$, and that it carries
  sums to sums and products to products, is [[lem-of-naturals-positive]], stated
  for an ordered field. That lemma introduces the same element by the equivalent
  recursion $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, which
  agrees with the definition above because $\iota(1) = \iota(0) + 1_F = 1_F$.
  Nothing here is new mathematics; the definition exists so that the notation has
  a home a reader can look up.

- **The symbol $\iota$ is used in this library for other canonical maps, and this
  definition does not govern them.** It also denotes the canonical field
  embedding $\iota : \mathbb{Q} \to F$ ([[lem-of-q-embeds]]), the isometric
  embedding of a metric space into a completion ([[def-metric-completion]]), and
  an inclusion map $\iota : S \to X$ of a subspace. Each of those is introduced
  where it is used and means something different from the map defined here. What
  the four share is only that each is the canonical map of its situation.

- **Fields, not just ordered fields.** The recursion needs no order, so the
  definition is stated for a field; every use in this library is in an ordered
  field, and the order is what makes $\iota$ injective
  ([[lem-of-naturals-positive]]). In a field of positive characteristic $\iota$
  is not injective, which is one reason the injectivity is a lemma rather than
  part of the definition.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field with its order and
absolute value ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]), and
neighbourhoods are those of [[def-neighbourhood-r]].

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Then
$f$ is **continuous at $c$** when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

with $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ ranging over the **positive reals**. In the
language of neighbourhoods: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ with

$$f\bigl(A \cap N_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \;\subseteq\; N_{\varepsilon}\bigl(f(c)\bigr).$$

$f$ is **continuous on $A$** when it is continuous at every point of $A$.

**The point $c$ is required to lie in $A$, and the condition is unpunctured.**
Both differ from [[def-function-limit]], and deliberately. There the quantifier
runs over $0 < |x - c| < \delta$, which removes $x = c$; here $x = c$ is allowed,
and at $x = c$ the implication reads $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$, which is
automatic. So allowing $x = c$ costs nothing, and it is what lets the definition
be stated at every point of $A$, including the points where no limit exists.

**Three clauses, and all three are part of the definition.**

1. **At a limit point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is a limit point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]). Then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if the
   limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and
   $$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) \;=\; f(c)$$
   ([[def-function-limit]]). Indeed, for a given $\varepsilon > 0$ a $\delta$
   witnessing continuity witnesses the limit condition, because the limit
   condition quantifies over a subset of the points continuity quantifies over;
   and conversely a $\delta$ witnessing $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$ witnesses
   continuity, because the one point it omits, $x = c$, satisfies
   $|f(c) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ anyway.

2. **At an isolated point.** Suppose $c \in A$ is an isolated point of $A$
   ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so that $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ for some real
   $\eta > 0$. Then **every** $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$: take
   $\delta := \eta$, so that the only $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ is $c$
   itself, and $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$.

3. **On a set.** Continuity on $A$ is continuity at each point of $A$, and
   nothing more. It is not a condition relating $f$ to points outside $A$.

Every point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$,
and never both ([[def-limit-point-r]]), so clauses 1 and 2 between them describe
continuity at every point of $A$.

**This is not the raw $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ formula of
[[fs-limit-unique-at-every-point-of-the-domain]].** That item records what goes
wrong when the *punctured* formula of [[def-function-limit]] is written down at
an arbitrary point of the domain: at an isolated point it is satisfied
vacuously by every real $L$ at once, so it defines nothing, and this library
therefore leaves $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ **undefined** at an isolated point.
Continuity at an isolated point is a different matter: the formula above is not
vacuous — it is a genuine condition on $f(c)$, satisfied because $f(c)$ is the
only value being compared with itself — and it names a single, well-defined
property. The limit is undefined there; the continuity is defined, and is
automatic. Clause 1 is the only place where the two notions meet, and it is
stated only where the limit exists as a notion.

**Where the distinction disappears.** If $A$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), then every $c \in A$ has some
$N_{\eta}(c) \subseteq A$, and a punctured neighbourhood is never empty
([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), so every point of $A$ is a limit point of $A$ and
clause 1 covers the whole of $A$. The same holds when $A$ is a nondegenerate
interval ([[def-interval]]). Isolated points are what force clause 2 to exist at
all, and they occur as soon as $A$ is allowed to be an arbitrary subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, as in $A = \{0\} \cup [1,2]$.

## Remarks

- **Continuity is local.** If $\eta > 0$ and $g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ agrees with
  $f$ on $A \cap N_{\eta}(c)$, then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if $g$
  is: any $\delta$ may be replaced by $\min\{\delta, \eta\}$, after which the
  condition only ever evaluates the two functions where they agree. So
  continuity at $c$ sees only an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of $c$, exactly
  as the limit does ([[lem-limit-is-local]]).

- **Continuity passes to subsets of the domain.** If $B \subseteq A$ and
  $c \in B$, then continuity of $f$ at $c$ gives continuity of the restriction
  $f|_B$ at $c$, with the same $\delta$: the condition on $f|_B$ quantifies over
  fewer points. The converse fails, and the standard witness is the indicator of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ restricted to $\mathbb{Q}$, which is constant and hence
  continuous, while the indicator itself is continuous nowhere
  ([[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]]).

- **The radius is a real number.** As in [[def-neighbourhood-r]], $\varepsilon$
  and $\delta$ range over the positive reals here. Restricting either quantifier
  to the positive rationals defines the same relation, by the passage recorded
  in [[def-function-limit]]: below every positive real lies a positive rational
  ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and a real $\delta$ may be shrunk to a rational
  one below it.

- **The word *continuous* is used for two things in this library, and they
  agree.** [[def-metric-continuity]] defines continuity of a map between metric
  spaces, and $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ carries the metric $d(x,y) = |x-y|$. The
  two notions coincide, and that is proved, not assumed:
  [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]] is the dictionary, and it is stated on
  this page precisely so that no later item has to guess.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with open and closed sets as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

- $A$ is an **$F_\sigma$ set** when there is a sequence $(F_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$
  of closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ with
  $$A \;=\; \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} F_n .$$
- $A$ is a **$G_\delta$ set** when there is a sequence $(V_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$
  of open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ with
  $$A \;=\; \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} V_n .$$

The letters are the traditional ones: $F$ for *fermé* with $\sigma$ for *somme*,
$G$ for *Gebiet* with $\delta$ for *Durchschnitt*.

**The two classes are exchanged by complementation.** $A$ is $F_\sigma$ if and
only if $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ is $G_\delta$. If $A = \bigcup_n F_n$ with each
$F_n$ closed, then $\mathbb{R} \setminus A = \bigcap_n (\mathbb{R} \setminus F_n)$
by De Morgan, and each $\mathbb{R} \setminus F_n$ is open by the definition of
closedness ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]); the converse is the same computation
read backwards, using that the complement of an open set is closed, which is
again [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

**Every closed set is $F_\sigma$ and every open set is $G_\delta$**, by the
constant sequence $F_n := A$, respectively $V_n := A$. As with
[[def-nowhere-dense-meager]], an at most countable family ([[def-countable]]) may
always be presented as a sequence: a finite list $F_0, \dots, F_m$ of closed sets
is extended by $F_n := F_m$ for $n > m$, and a finite list of open sets likewise,
so nothing is lost by indexing over $\mathbb{N}$.

## Remarks

- **The classes are genuinely larger than the closed and the open sets.**
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is $F_\sigma$ and is neither open nor closed, and the irrationals
  are $G_\delta$ and neither open nor closed; both computations are in
  [[cor-q-is-meager-and-not-g-delta]]. That $\mathbb{Q}$ is not also $G_\delta$
  is the first genuinely hard fact about these classes and needs the Baire
  category theorem ([[thm-baire-category-r]]).

- **Why the algebra of open sets is not enough.** [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]
  gives that a *finite* intersection of open sets is open and a *finite* union of
  closed sets is closed. The definitions above are exactly what one gets by
  relaxing "finite" to "countable" once, and the point of the whole notion is
  that the relaxation is proper: a countable intersection of open sets need not
  be open, which is [[cex-intersection-of-shrinking-intervals-not-open]].

- **Nothing here is a measure-theoretic notion.** $F_\sigma$ and $G_\delta$ are
  defined from the topology of $\mathbb{R}$ alone and are used on this page to
  say precisely how far $\mathbb{Q}$ and its complement sit from being closed or
  open. They cut across [[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]] completely:
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is $F_\sigma$ and has measure zero
  ([[lem-countable-sets-are-null]]), while the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set is
  closed, hence $F_\sigma$, and does not
  ([[thm-fat-cantor-set-has-positive-measure]]).

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with open and closed sets as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

- The **interior** of $A$ is the union of all open subsets of $A$:
  $$A^{\circ} \;:=\; \bigcup \{\, U \subseteq \mathbb{R} : U \text{ open and } U \subseteq A \,\}.$$
- The **closure** of $A$ is the intersection of all closed supersets of $A$:
  $$\overline{A} \;:=\; \bigcap \{\, F \subseteq \mathbb{R} : F \text{ closed and } A \subseteq F \,\}.$$
- The **boundary** of $A$ is $\partial A := \overline{A} \setminus A^{\circ}$.
- The **exterior** of $A$ is $\operatorname{ext} A := (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)^{\circ}$.

**Both operators are well defined and deliver what their names claim.** The
family whose union defines $A^{\circ}$ always contains $\varnothing$, and the
family whose intersection defines $\overline{A}$ always contains $\mathbb{R}$,
so the second family is nonempty and both expressions denote subsets of
$\mathbb{R}$ without appeal to any convention about empty unions or
intersections. Moreover:

- $A^{\circ}$ is **open**, being a union of open sets
  ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], claim 1), and $A^{\circ} \subseteq A$, since
  every set in the family is a subset of $A$. It is therefore the **largest**
  open subset of $A$: any open $U \subseteq A$ is a member of the family and so
  $U \subseteq A^{\circ}$.
- $\overline{A}$ is **closed**, being an intersection of a nonempty family of
  closed sets ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], claim 3), and $A \subseteq
  \overline{A}$, since every set in the family contains $A$. It is therefore the
  **smallest** closed superset of $A$: any closed $F \supseteq A$ is a member of
  the family and so $\overline{A} \subseteq F$.

**Pointwise description of the interior.** For $x \in \mathbb{R}$,

$$x \in A^{\circ} \iff \text{there is } \varepsilon > 0 \text{ with } N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A .$$

If $x \in A^{\circ}$ then, $A^{\circ}$ being open and containing $x$, there is
$\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A^{\circ} \subseteq A$.
Conversely if $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A$ then $N_\varepsilon(x)$ is an open
subset of $A$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) containing $x$, hence
$x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq A^{\circ}$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

The corresponding pointwise description of the closure is not a definitional
matter and is proved separately, as [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

## Remarks

- **The four sets partition nothing by themselves, but three of them do.** For
  every $A$ the three sets $A^{\circ}$, $\partial A$ and $\operatorname{ext} A$
  are pairwise disjoint with union $\mathbb{R}$. This is not proved here and is
  not used on this page; what is used is only the definitions above and the
  characterisations of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

- **Interior and closure are dual.** Complementation exchanges the two families
  above, since $U$ is open exactly when $\mathbb{R} \setminus U$ is closed, so
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus A^{\circ} = \overline{\mathbb{R} \setminus A}$ and
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A} = (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)^{\circ} =
  \operatorname{ext} A$. The second identity is the reason the exterior is
  usually described as "the complement of the closure".

- **$A$ is open exactly when $A = A^{\circ}$, and closed exactly when
  $A = \overline{A}$.** For the first: $A^{\circ} \subseteq A$ always, and
  $A \subseteq A^{\circ}$ holds exactly when $A$ is one of the open subsets of
  $A$, that is, exactly when $A$ is open. The closure half is the same argument
  read the other way, and it is recorded as a claim of
  [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] because the rest of that theorem needs it.

- **Boundary points may or may not belong to the set.** $\partial (0,1) =
  \partial [0,1] = \{0,1\}$, and the two boundary points lie outside the first
  set and inside the second; the boundary sees only the way the set meets its
  complement, not which side the edge is assigned to.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]).

A subset $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **order-convex** when

$$x, y \in I \text{ and } x \le z \le y \;\Longrightarrow\; z \in I .$$

The **intervals** of $\mathbb{R}$ are the sets of the following nine forms, where
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:

| | bounded forms | | one-sided and full forms |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(a,b)$ | $\{x : a < x < b\}$ | $(a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a < x\}$ |
| $[a,b]$ | $\{x : a \le x \le b\}$ | $[a,\infty)$ | $\{x : a \le x\}$ |
| $[a,b)$ | $\{x : a \le x < b\}$ | $(-\infty,b)$ | $\{x : x < b\}$ |
| $(a,b]$ | $\{x : a < x \le b\}$ | $(-\infty,b]$ | $\{x : x \le b\}$ |
| | | $(-\infty,\infty)$ | $\mathbb{R}$ |

An interval is **open** when both of its written endpoints are excluded, that is
for the forms $(a,b)$, $(a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$; it is
**closed** when both written endpoints are included, that is for $[a,b]$,
$[a,\infty)$, $(-\infty,b]$ and $(-\infty,\infty)$. The forms $[a,b)$ and
$(a,b]$ are **half-open**.

**The symbols $\pm\infty$ are notation and not elements of $\mathbb{R}$.** They
mark which side carries no endpoint condition at all; the five forms in the right
column are defined by the displayed conditions on $x$ alone, and no arithmetic is
ever performed with $\infty$. This is the same refusal to extend $\mathbb{R}$
silently that [[rem-sup-conventions]] records for suprema.

**Every one of the nine forms is order-convex.** Each is defined by a conjunction
of at most two conditions, each of the shape $a < x$, $a \le x$, $x < b$ or
$x \le b$, and each such condition is inherited by an intermediate point: if
$a < x$ and $x \le z$ then $a < z$, and if $z \le y$ and $y < b$ then $z < b$,
by transitivity of the order ([[def-ordered-field]]). Applying this to whichever
one or two conditions define the form in question gives $z \in I$ whenever
$x, y \in I$ and $x \le z \le y$.

**Bounded intervals.** An interval is **bounded** ([[def-bounded-set]]) exactly
when it is of one of the four forms in the left column: for those, $a$ is a lower
bound and $b$ an upper bound. The other five forms are unbounded, on the side or
sides written with $\infty$; the verification is in the remarks below.

**Nondegeneracy.** An interval is **degenerate** when it has at most one element,
and **nondegenerate** when it has at least two. For the four bounded forms with
endpoints $a$ and $b$:

- $[a,b]$ is nonempty exactly when $a \le b$, and it is nondegenerate exactly
  when $a < b$. It is the singleton $\{a\}$ when $a = b$.
- $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are nonempty exactly when $a < b$, and then each
  is nondegenerate.

The only assertion here that is not immediate from the defining conditions is
that $a < b$ makes $(a,b)$ nonempty with at least two points. It holds because
$a < (a+b)/2 < b$, which follows from $a < b$ by adding $a$, respectively $b$, to
both sides and halving ([[def-ordered-field]]); repeating the halving inside
$(a, (a+b)/2)$ produces a second point.

**Closed bounded intervals.** These are the sets $[a,b]$ with $a \le b$, which is
exactly the condition making them nonempty. They are the intervals the nested
interval property is stated for, and the phrase *closed bounded interval* always
carries the hypothesis $a \le b$ in this library.

**Length.** The **length** of a bounded interval presented by its endpoints
$a \le b$ is

$$\ell = b - a \;\ge\; 0 .$$

Length is attached to the presentation by endpoints and is not recovered from the
set: $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are all empty when $a = b$, and so is
$(c,c)$ for any other $c$, while each of these presentations has length $0$, so
nothing inconsistent arises; but the endpoints are named explicitly at every
point where a length is used in this library, and never inferred from the set.
Unbounded intervals are assigned no length.

## Remarks

- **Why the five unbounded forms really are unbounded.** Take $[a,\infty)$ and
  suppose $u \in \mathbb{R}$ were an upper bound of it. The element
  $x = a + |u - a| + 1$ satisfies $x \ge a$, so $x \in [a,\infty)$, and
  $x \ge a + (u - a) + 1 = u + 1 > u$, since $|t| \ge t$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]])
  and $1 > 0$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]). That contradicts $x \le u$. The same
  computation with $a$ replaced by any element of $(a,\infty)$ handles the open
  form, and reflecting through the origin handles $(-\infty,b)$ and
  $(-\infty,b]$; $\mathbb{R}$ itself is unbounded on both sides for the same
  reason. Note that this uses no Archimedean property: it is the failure of a
  *single* bound, not the cofinality of the naturals.

- **The converse classification is not asserted here.** It is true that every
  order-convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is empty or one of the nine forms, and the
  proof runs through suprema and infima, but nothing in this library needs it and
  it is not proved anywhere here. What is used is only the direction proved
  above: each of the nine forms is order-convex.

- **Degenerate intervals are kept, not excluded.** $[a,a] = \{a\}$ and
  $(a,a) = \emptyset$ are intervals under this definition. Excluding them would
  force a nonemptiness hypothesis into every statement that produces an interval,
  and the nested interval property is a good illustration: its conclusion is that
  the intersection is nonempty, and in the equality case the intersection is the
  degenerate interval $[a,a]$, which is exactly the single point.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]] and closure as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]].

- $x$ is an **adherent point** of $A$ when $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne
  \varnothing$ for every real $\varepsilon > 0$.
- $x$ is a **limit point** (or *accumulation point*) of $A$ when
  $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing$ for every real
  $\varepsilon > 0$: every punctured neighbourhood of $x$ meets $A$.
- $x$ is an **isolated point** of $A$ when $x \in A$ and there is a real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$.
- The **derived set** of $A$ is
  $$A' \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \text{ is a limit point of } A \,\}.$$
- $A$ is **dense in $\mathbb{R}$** when $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$.

**A limit point is an adherent point**, since $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq
N_\varepsilon(x)$; and an element of $A$ is an adherent point of $A$, since
$x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). So the adherent
points of $A$ are exactly the points of $A \cup A'$, a statement proved as part
of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]].

**Limit point and isolated point are exact opposites inside $A$.** For
$x \in A$: $x$ is an isolated point of $A$ exactly when it is not a limit point
of $A$. Indeed $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \{x\}$ says precisely that
$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, because $x$ itself always lies in
$N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ when $x \in A$; so the existence of an $\varepsilon$
witnessing isolation is the negation of the condition defining a limit point.
A point of $A$ is therefore either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$, and
never both.

**A limit point need not belong to the set, and a point of the set need not be a
limit point.** Both possibilities occur, and the two examples that matter later
are $0$, which is a limit point of $\{\, 1/k : k \ge 1 \,\}$ without belonging
to it, and $0$ again, which belongs to $\{0\} \cup [1,2]$ as an isolated point.

## Remarks

- **Terminology: *limit point* here is about a set, never about a sequence.**
  This library reserves *subsequential limit* for the sequential notion
  ([[def-subsequential-limit]]), and the two are genuinely different: the
  constant sequence $x_k = 0$ has $0$ as a subsequential limit, while its set of
  values $\{0\}$ has no limit point at all. The distinction is the one
  [[def-subsequential-limit]] records under "Terminology", and it is respected
  throughout this page.

- **Density is defined through the closure, not through intervals.** Saying
  $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}$ is equivalent to saying that every nonempty open
  subset of $\mathbb{R}$ meets $A$, and also to saying that every neighbourhood
  of every real meets $A$; the equivalences follow from
  [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] and are used in that form in
  [[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]].

- **The derived set need not be comparable with the set.** It can be strictly
  larger, as for $\mathbb{Q}$: every punctured neighbourhood of any real
  contains a rational, since density supplies one strictly between $x$ and
  $x + \varepsilon$ ([[lem-q-and-irrationals-dense-r]]), so the derived set of
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is all of $\mathbb{R}$. It can be strictly smaller, as for
  $\{0\}$, whose derived set is empty; and it can be neither, as for
  $\{0\} \cup (1,2)$, whose derived set is $[1,2]$, a set containing points
  outside the original and omitting the point $0$ of it. A closed set satisfying
  $A \subseteq A'$ is called perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]).

## Definition

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $m \in \mathbb{R}$.

- $m$ is a **maximum** (or *greatest element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $s \le m$
  for every $s \in S$.
- $m$ is a **minimum** (or *least element*) of $S$ if $m \in S$ and $m \le s$
  for every $s \in S$.

A set has at most one maximum: if $m_1$ and $m_2$ are both maxima then
$m_1 \in S$ gives $m_1 \le m_2$ and $m_2 \in S$ gives $m_2 \le m_1$, so
$m_1 = m_2$ by antisymmetry of the order, which is immediate from the trichotomy
axiom of an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).
The same argument applies to minima, so we may write $\max S$ and $\min S$.

## Remarks

- A maximum is precisely an upper bound of $S$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]])
  that happens to lie in $S$; a minimum is a lower bound of $S$
  ([[def-bounded-set]]) that lies in $S$. In particular a set with a maximum is
  bounded above and a set with a minimum is bounded below.
- The empty set has neither a maximum nor a minimum, because the requirement
  $m \in S$ cannot be met.
- The membership requirement $m \in S$ is exactly what separates a maximum from a
  supremum, and it is the theme of this page. A supremum is a bound on the set
  and is not asked to belong to it; a maximum is an element of the set. The two
  agree exactly when the supremum happens to be attained ([[lem-max-is-sup]]),
  and they genuinely differ in general ([[fs-sup-belongs-to-set]]).
- Every nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has both a maximum and a minimum
  ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]), which is what licenses the notation
  $\max\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$. Infinite sets need not: the failure of attainment is
  an infinitary phenomenon.

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) with its order
([[def-real-order]]) and its absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]).

Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ with
$\varepsilon > 0$. The **$\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\},$$

and the **punctured $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$** is

$$N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \;:=\; N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \;=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}.$$

The two descriptions of $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ agree because $|y - x| = 0$ holds
exactly when $y = x$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**A neighbourhood is an open interval.** For every $x$ and every
$\varepsilon > 0$,

$$N_\varepsilon(x) \;=\; (x - \varepsilon,\ x + \varepsilon),$$

the interval of [[def-interval]]. Indeed [[lem-of-abs-value]] gives, for
$\varepsilon > 0$, the equivalence $|y - x| < \varepsilon \iff -\varepsilon <
y - x < \varepsilon$, and adding $x$ throughout turns the right-hand side into
$x - \varepsilon < y < x + \varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**The centre lies in its own neighbourhoods.** $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, since
$|x - x| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

**Punctured neighbourhoods are never empty.** The element
$y := x + \varepsilon/2$ satisfies $|y - x| = \varepsilon/2$, which is
$> 0$ and $< \varepsilon$, so $y \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$
([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

**Monotonicity in the radius.** If $0 < \delta \le \varepsilon$ then
$N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, because $|y - x| < \delta \le
\varepsilon$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

**Nesting at an interior point.** If $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and
$0 < \delta \le \varepsilon - |y - x|$, then

$$N_\delta(y) \;\subseteq\; N_\varepsilon(x).$$

Indeed for $z \in N_\delta(y)$ the triangle inequality
([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]]) gives
$|z - x| = |(z - y) + (y - x)| \le |z - y| + |y - x| < \delta + |y - x| \le
\varepsilon$. Note that $\varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ precisely because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$, so such a $\delta$ always exists.

## Remarks

- **The radius is a real number, not a rational.** Nothing on this page tests a
  condition against rational radii only. That convention belongs to
  [[def-real-limit]], where the quantifier is over rational $\varepsilon$ and
  the passage between the rational and the real form is the sanctioned remark of
  [[def-sequence]]. Here $\varepsilon$ ranges over the positive reals
  throughout, and every statement above is proved for an arbitrary positive
  real.

- **Why the punctured version is separated out.** A limit point of a set is a
  point every punctured neighbourhood of which meets the set
  ([[def-limit-point-r]]), and deleting the centre is exactly what stops a point
  of the set from qualifying automatically. The unpunctured condition defines
  the weaker notion of an adherent point, and the difference between the two is
  precisely an isolated point.

- **Nesting is the workhorse.** Almost every openness verification on this page
  has the shape "given $y$ in the set, shrink the radius by the distance
  already travelled", which is the nesting property above. It is recorded here
  once so that no later proof has to redo the triangle inequality in passing.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with interior $A^{\circ}$ and closure
$\overline{A}$ as in [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]].

- $A$ is **nowhere dense** when the interior of its closure is empty:
  $$\big(\overline{A}\big)^{\circ} \;=\; \varnothing .$$
- $A$ is **meager**, or **of the first category**, when there is a sequence
  $(A_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of nowhere dense subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ with
  $$A \;=\; \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n .$$
- $A$ is **of the second category** when it is not meager.
- $A$ is **residual** (also *comeager*) when $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ is meager.

**Why a sequence, and why that is the same as "an at most countable union".**
Sequences here are indexed by $\mathbb{N}$, which contains $0$. A finite family
$A_0, \dots, A_m$ of nowhere dense sets is turned into a sequence by setting
$A_n := \varnothing$ for $n > m$, and $\varnothing$ is nowhere dense because
$\overline{\varnothing} = \varnothing$ has empty interior; the empty family is
handled the same way and gives $A = \varnothing$. So "a union of an at most
countable family of nowhere dense sets" ([[def-countable]]) and the displayed
condition define the same class, and the sequence form is used below because it
carries an explicit index and needs no case split.

**Nowhere dense means exactly that the complement of the closure is dense.**
For $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$,

$$\big(\overline{A}\big)^{\circ} = \varnothing \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A} \text{ is dense in } \mathbb{R} .$$

Indeed, by the pointwise description of the interior
([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]), $(\overline{A})^{\circ} = \varnothing$
says that no $x \in \mathbb{R}$ admits a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with
$N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq \overline{A}$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]), that is,
that every $N_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $\mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A}$. By
claim 1 of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]] that says precisely that every
$x \in \mathbb{R}$ is adherent to $\mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A}$, that is,
$\overline{\mathbb{R} \setminus \overline{A}} = \mathbb{R}$, which is density
([[def-limit-point-r]]).

**A closed set is nowhere dense exactly when its interior is empty**, since a
closed set equals its own closure (claim 4 of [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]],
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]). This is the form in which nowhere density is
verified nearly every time below. (The phrase *almost everywhere* is avoided
throughout this pair: it is a measure-theoretic term, and the only measure notion
defined here is measure zero.)

**Both classes are closed downwards.** If $B \subseteq A$ then
$\overline{B} \subseteq \overline{A}$ and hence
$(\overline{B})^{\circ} \subseteq (\overline{A})^{\circ}$
([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]]), so a subset of a nowhere dense set is
nowhere dense. If $B \subseteq A = \bigcup_n A_n$ with each $A_n$ nowhere dense,
then $B = \bigcup_n (A_n \cap B)$ and each $A_n \cap B$ is nowhere dense by the
previous sentence, so a subset of a meager set is meager.

**A union of two meager sets is meager.** Let $M = \bigcup_n A_n$ and
$M' = \bigcup_n B_n$ with all $A_n$ and all $B_n$ nowhere dense; fixing one
witnessing sequence for $M$ and one for $M'$ is two instantiations of an
existential statement, not a choice principle. Let
$J : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ be a bijection
([[thm-n-cross-n-countable]]) and define a sequence $(C_j)_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ by

$$C_{J(m,n)} \;:=\; \begin{cases} A_n & m = 0, \\ B_n & m \ne 0. \end{cases}$$

This is a total definition because $J$ is a bijection, every $C_j$ is nowhere
dense, and $\bigcup_j C_j = M \cup M'$, since $A_n = C_{J(0,n)}$ and
$B_n = C_{J(1,n)}$ and every $C_j$ is one of the $A_n$ or one of the $B_n$.

## Remarks

- **The countably infinite version of the last observation is a different
  statement.** To show that $\bigcup_i M_i$ is meager for a sequence $(M_i)$ of
  meager sets one must select a witnessing sequence of nowhere dense sets for
  every $i$ at once, which is an application of countable choice
  ([[def-countable-choice]]); the two-set case above avoids it because two
  selections are two instantiations. Nothing on this page uses the countably
  infinite version, and every meager set met below is presented together with an
  explicit witnessing sequence.

- **Nowhere dense is strictly stronger than having empty interior.**
  $\mathbb{Q}$ has empty interior, since no neighbourhood consists of rationals
  alone, yet $\overline{\mathbb{Q}} = \mathbb{R}$ has interior $\mathbb{R}$, so
  $\mathbb{Q}$ is not nowhere dense. It is nevertheless meager, being a union of
  singletons; that computation is [[cor-q-is-meager-and-not-g-delta]].

- **First category, second category and residual are not a trichotomy.** A set
  is meager or of the second category, and those two are exhaustive and
  exclusive by definition. Residual is a separate condition on the complement: a
  residual set is of the second category once $\mathbb{R}$ is known not to be
  meager in itself ([[thm-baire-category-r]]), but before that theorem nothing
  rules out a set that is both meager and residual.

- **Category is a notion of topological smallness, and it is independent of
  smallness in the sense of measure.** Neither of the two implications between
  "nowhere dense" and "measure zero" ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]])
  holds, and $\mathbb{R}$ itself splits into a meager set and a set of measure
  zero; the three items settling this are
  [[fs-nowhere-dense-implies-measure-zero]],
  [[fs-measure-zero-implies-nowhere-dense]] and
  [[cex-meager-set-of-full-measure]].

## Definition

Let $U, F \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with neighbourhoods as in
[[def-neighbourhood-r]].

- $U$ is **open** when for every $x \in U$ there is a real $\varepsilon > 0$
  with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$.
- $F$ is **closed** when its complement $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open.
- A set is **clopen** when it is both open and closed.

The whole of the topology of $\mathbb{R}$ developed on this page rests on this
one definition: closedness is *defined* as openness of the complement, and every
other description of a closed set on this page is a theorem
([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]]).

**$\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen.** The condition defining openness
quantifies over the elements of the set, so it holds vacuously for
$\varnothing$; and for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ one has $N_1(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$,
so $\mathbb{R}$ is open. Since each of the two is the complement of the other,
each is also closed.

**Every neighbourhood is open.** Let $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ and put
$\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x|$, which is $> 0$ because
$y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$. The nesting property of [[def-neighbourhood-r]] gives
$N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$. So every point of $N_\varepsilon(x)$
has a neighbourhood inside it.

**The four open forms of [[def-interval]] are open sets.** Let $a, b \in
\mathbb{R}$.

- $(a,b)$: for $x$ with $a < x < b$, both $x - a > 0$ and $b - x > 0$, so
  $\delta := \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ is a positive real (the minimum of a
  two-element set of reals exists, [[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).
  If $|y - x| < \delta$ then $y > x - \delta \ge x - (x - a) = a$ and
  $y < x + \delta \le x + (b - x) = b$, so $y \in (a,b)$; hence
  $N_\delta(x) \subseteq (a,b)$.
- $(a,\infty)$: for $x > a$ take $\delta := x - a > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y > x - \delta = a$.
- $(-\infty,b)$: for $x < b$ take $\delta := b - x > 0$; then $|y - x| < \delta$
  gives $y < x + \delta = b$.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: already treated above.

**The four closed forms of [[def-interval]] are closed sets.** In each case the
complement is shown open directly.

- $[a,b]$: if $x \notin [a,b]$ then $x < a$ or $x > b$ by trichotomy
  ([[def-ordered-field]]). If $x < a$, take $\delta := a - x > 0$; every
  $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has $y < x + \delta = a$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. If
  $x > b$, take $\delta := x - b > 0$; every $y \in N_\delta(x)$ has
  $y > x - \delta = b$, hence $y \notin [a,b]$. So
  $\mathbb{R} \setminus [a,b]$ is open.
- $[a,\infty)$: its complement is $(-\infty,a)$, which is open by the previous
  paragraph.
- $(-\infty,b]$: its complement is $(b,\infty)$, which is open.
- $(-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$: its complement is $\varnothing$, which is
  open.

## Remarks

- **Open and closed are not opposites, and not exhaustive.** A set may be
  neither: the half-open interval $[0,1)$ is neither open nor closed
  ([[fs-every-set-is-open-or-closed]]). A set may be both: $\varnothing$ and
  $\mathbb{R}$ are clopen. The words are inherited from the interval terminology
  of [[def-interval]], and the agreement between the two usages is exactly the
  two lists verified above: an interval called open there is an open set here,
  and an interval called closed there is a closed set here.

- **A clopen set is a disconnection waiting to happen.** If $A$ is clopen and
  both $A$ and $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ are nonempty, then each of the two is
  its own closure, so the two are separated in the sense of
  [[def-connected-r]] and $\mathbb{R} = A \cup (\mathbb{R} \setminus A)$ is a
  disconnection. Since $\mathbb{R}$ is order-convex it is connected
  ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]]), so no such $A$ exists:
  $\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are the only clopen subsets of $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The half-open forms are the ones the two lists omit**, and deliberately so:
  $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ with $a < b$ are neither open nor closed as subsets of
  $\mathbb{R}$.

- **The radius depends on the point.** Openness asks for *some* $\varepsilon$
  at each point, and that $\varepsilon$ may shrink to nothing as the point
  approaches the edge of the set, as the computation for $(a,b)$ shows: there
  $\delta = \min\{x - a,\ b - x\}$ tends to $0$ as $x$ tends to either endpoint.
  Asking instead for a single $\varepsilon$ that works simultaneously at every
  point of the set is a strictly stronger condition, and it is not what is
  defined here; nothing on this page uses it.

## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$. All suprema and
infima below are taken in the extended real line
$\overline{\mathbb{R}} = \mathbb{R} \cup \{-\infty, +\infty\}$
([[def-extended-reals]]), where **every** subset has a least upper bound and a
greatest lower bound ([[lem-extended-reals-complete]]); no boundedness
hypothesis on $f$ is therefore needed anywhere, and none is imposed.

**Oscillation on a set.** For $S \subseteq A$ put

$$\omega_f(S) \;:=\; \sup\{\, |f(x) - f(y)| \;:\; x, y \in S \,\} \;\in\; \overline{\mathbb{R}} .$$

**Oscillation at a point.** For $c \in A$ put

$$\omega_f(c) \;:=\; \inf\{\, \omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c)) \;:\; \delta \in \mathbb{R},\ \delta > 0 \,\} \;\in\; \overline{\mathbb{R}},$$

where $N_\delta(c) = (c - \delta, c + \delta)$ is the $\delta$-neighbourhood of
$c$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

The two uses of the symbol $\omega_f$ are distinguished by their argument: a
subset of $A$ in the first, a point of $A$ in the second. Where confusion is
possible the first is written $\omega_f(S)$ with $S$ named as a set.

### Both values are well posed; point oscillation and nonempty-set oscillation are nonnegative

**The set in the first display is nonempty whenever $S$ is**, since $x = y \in S$
gives the value $|f(x) - f(x)| = 0$; so $\omega_f(S) \ge 0$ for nonempty $S$,
and $\omega_f(S) = \sup \varnothing = -\infty$ for $S = \varnothing$
([[lem-extended-reals-complete]]). Only nonempty $S$ occurs below.

**The set in the second display is nonempty**, since some real $\delta > 0$
exists, and each of its members is $\ge 0$: for $c \in A$ the set
$A \cap N_\delta(c)$ contains $c$ itself, because $|c - c| = 0 < \delta$, so it
is nonempty and $\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c)) \ge 0$
([[lem-of-abs-value]]). Hence $0$ is a lower bound of that set and

$$0 \;\le\; \omega_f(c) \;\le\; \omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c)) \qquad \text{for every real } \delta > 0,$$

the second inequality because $\omega_f(c)$ is a lower bound of the set of which
$\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c))$ is a member. In particular $\omega_f(c)$ is never
$-\infty$.

### Monotonicity, and the case of a bounded $f$

**$\omega_f$ is monotone under inclusion.** If $S \subseteq T \subseteq A$ then
every value $|f(x) - f(y)|$ with $x, y \in S$ is also a value with $x, y \in T$,
so the first set of values is contained in the second and
$\omega_f(S) \le \omega_f(T)$: a supremum of a subset is at most the supremum of
the set. Consequently $\delta \mapsto \omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c))$ is
nondecreasing in $\delta$, since $\delta \le \delta'$ gives
$N_\delta(c) \subseteq N_{\delta'}(c)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

**When $f$ is bounded, nonempty-set and point oscillations are real.** Suppose
there is a real $M$ with $|f(x)| \le M$ for every $x \in A$
([[def-bounded-set]]). Then for $x, y \in A$,

$$|f(x) - f(y)| \;\le\; |f(x)| + |f(y)| \;\le\; 2M$$

([[lem-of-triangle-inequality]], [[lem-of-abs-value]]), so $\omega_f(S) \le 2M$
for every $S \subseteq A$. If
$S$ is nonempty, $\omega_f(S)$ is a real number in $[0,2M]$, and every point
oscillation is also a real number in $[0,2M]$: the supremum of a nonempty
subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$ is the real
supremum ([[lem-extended-reals-complete]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]],
[[def-infimum]]). The convention $\omega_f(\varnothing)=-\infty$ remains the
single empty-set exception. Apart from that exception, an infinite extended
value can occur only when $f$ is unbounded.

**The notation.** The letter is $\omega$ throughout this library, never
"$\operatorname{osc}$", and the function is always in the subscript.

A sequence $(x_k)$ of reals **converges** to $x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for
every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with
$|x_k - x| < \hat\varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$. It is **Cauchy** when for

## Remarks

- Quantifying over rational $\varepsilon$ loses nothing: below any real
  $\varepsilon > 0$ lies a positive rational ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]).
- $|\cdot|$ is the absolute value of [[def-real-order]].

## Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]],
[[def-real-numbers]]) with its order and absolute value ([[def-real-order]]), and
$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers with its order ([[def-natural-numbers]],
[[def-nat-order]]).

A **sequence of reals** is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$. We write
$x_k$ for the value $x(k)$, call it the **$k$-th term**, and write $(x_k)$, or
$(x_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$, for the function itself. The **range** of $(x_k)$ is
the subset $\{\, x_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals and let $P$ be a property of indices.

- $(x_k)$ is **bounded** if there is $M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for
  every $k \in \mathbb{N}$; it is **unbounded** otherwise.
- $P$ holds **eventually** if there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $P(k)$ holds
  for every $k \ge K$.
- $P$ holds **frequently** if for every $K \in \mathbb{N}$ there is some
  $k \ge K$ for which $P(k)$ holds.
- For $K \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$K$-th tail** of $(x_k)$ is the sequence
  $x^{(K)}$ defined by $x^{(K)}_j := x_{j + K}$ for $j \in \mathbb{N}$; it is
  again a sequence of reals.
- A function $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is **strictly increasing** if
  $n_j < n_k$ whenever $j < k$. For such an $n$, the **subsequence** of $(x_k)$
  along $n$ is the composite $x \circ n$, written $(x_{n_k})_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$;
  it is again a sequence of reals.

**Convergence and Cauchyness are not defined here.** They are already fixed, for
sequences of reals, by the published [[def-real-limit]]: $(x_k)$ *converges* to
$x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is
$K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$, and $(x_k)$
is *Cauchy* when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$
with $|x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$. This page builds the
toolkit for those two notions and does not restate them. A sequence
**converges** if it converges to some real, and **diverges** if it does not.

## Remarks

- **Identification of $\mathbb{Q}$ with its image.** The map $q \mapsto \hat q$
  is an embedding of ordered fields ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), and as is
  standard we write $q$ for $\hat q$, so that a rational may be compared with a
  real without further comment. [[def-real-limit]] is stated with the hat; every
  rational $\varepsilon$ occurring on this page is its image under this
  embedding.

- **Rational and real $\varepsilon$ agree.** [[def-real-limit]] tests convergence
  against every *rational* $\varepsilon > 0$, and its own remark records that
  this loses nothing. Spelled out: suppose that for every rational
  $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all
  $k \ge K$, and let $\eta > 0$ be an arbitrary *real*. Since $0 < \eta$,
  density of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]) supplies a
  rational $\varepsilon$ with $0 < \varepsilon < \eta$, and the index $K$
  belonging to that $\varepsilon$ satisfies $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon < \eta$ for
  all $k \ge K$. The converse implication is immediate, since every positive
  rational is a positive real. So the two formulations define the same relation,
  and the same two lines apply verbatim to the Cauchy condition and to any
  condition of the shape "for every $\varepsilon > 0$, eventually
  $\cdots < \varepsilon$". Proofs on this page therefore run the test with a real
  $\varepsilon$ wherever that is more convenient, and say so by citing this
  remark; nothing is smuggled in.

- **Constant sequences converge.** For $c \in \mathbb{R}$ the constant sequence
  $x_k := c$ converges to $c$, because $|x_k - c| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon$ for
  every $\varepsilon > 0$ and every $k$; it is bounded by $|c|$.

- **Eventually and frequently are dual.** $P$ holds frequently exactly when
  $\lnot P$ does not hold eventually, and $P$ holds eventually exactly when
  $\lnot P$ does not hold frequently. So the two quantifier patterns are
  negations of one another applied to the complementary property, and there is no
  third pattern hiding between them.

- **A sequence is not its range.** $(x_k)$ is a function, not a set, and the
  range does not determine the function: the sequence $x_0 = 0$, $x_k = 1$ for
  $k \ge 1$ and the sequence $y_0 = y_1 = 0$, $y_k = 1$ for $k \ge 2$ have the
  same range $\{0, 1\}$, yet they differ at $k = 1$, so they are different
  sequences. Order and repetition are part of the data and the range forgets
  both. Boundedness, on the other hand, depends only on the range.

- **Indexing.** Sequences here start at $k = 0$ because $\mathbb{N}$ contains
  $0$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]). Texts that index from $1$ describe the same
  objects up to a shift, and the shift changes nothing about convergence, by
  [[lem-limit-of-tail]].

## Statement

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$ and let $(F_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a
sequence of closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) with

$$[a,b] \;\subseteq\; \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} F_n$$

([[def-interval]]). Then there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and reals $u < v$ with

$$[u,v] \;\subseteq\; F_n \cap [a,b].$$

**No choice principle is used.** The only category input is
[[thm-baire-category-r]], whose own proof selects nothing: it fixes one
enumeration of the rationals and takes least indices. Nothing further is chosen
below, the argument being a direct application of that theorem to the
complements of the $F_n$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** Reals $a < b$ and a sequence $(F_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ with $[a,b] \subseteq \bigcup_{n} F_n$.

[L1] A countable intersection of dense open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-baire-category-r]]); *dense* means that the closure is $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]).

[L2] $\overline{S} = \mathbb{R}$ if and only if $N_\varepsilon(y) \cap S \ne \varnothing$ for every real $y$ and every real $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[thm-closure-characterisations-r]], claim 1, [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] An intersection of two closed sets is closed, and the complement of a closed set is open ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]], claim 3, [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L4] $[a,b]$ is closed: its complement $\{x : x < a\} \cup \{x : x > b\}$ is open, since $x < a$ gives $N_{a-x}(x) \subseteq \{z : z < a\}$ and $x > b$ gives $N_{x-b}(x) \subseteq \{z : z > b\}$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L5] $N_\varepsilon(y) = (y - \varepsilon, y + \varepsilon)$, and for $a < b$ the midpoint $y := (a+b)/2$ and radius $\varepsilon := (b-a)/2 > 0$ give $N_\varepsilon(y) = (a,b) \subseteq [a,b]$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-interval]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** contradiction.

1.1 Put $G_n := F_n \cap [a,b]$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Each $G_n$ is closed, being an intersection of two closed sets, and $[a,b] = \bigcup_{n} G_n$, since $[a,b]$ is contained in the union of the $F_n$ and each $G_n$ is contained in $[a,b]$. [L3, L4]

1.2 Suppose, for contradiction, that no $G_n$ contains a nondegenerate closed interval, that is, that there are no $n$ and no reals $u < v$ with $[u,v] \subseteq G_n$. [assume-contra]

2.1 Each $V_n := \mathbb{R} \setminus G_n$ is open, and it is dense. Openness is the complement of a closed set. For density, let $y$ be real and $\varepsilon > 0$ real; if $N_\varepsilon(y) \cap V_n$ were empty then $N_\varepsilon(y) \subseteq G_n$, and then $[y - \varepsilon/2,\ y + \varepsilon/2]$ would be a nondegenerate closed interval inside $G_n$, contrary to step 1.2. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L2, L3, L5]

3.1 By the Baire category theorem the intersection $\bigcap_{n} V_n$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$, so it meets the neighbourhood $N_{(b-a)/2}\bigl((a+b)/2\bigr) = (a,b)$: there is $x \in (a,b)$ with $x \notin G_n$ for every $n$. [step 2.1, L1, L2, L5]

4.1 But $x \in (a,b) \subseteq [a,b] = \bigcup_{n} G_n$, so $x \in G_n$ for some $n$, contradicting step 3.1. The assumption of step 1.2 is therefore false, and some $G_n = F_n \cap [a,b]$ contains a nondegenerate closed interval $[u,v]$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 3.1, discharge-contradiction] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the statement is about $[a,b]$ and not about $\mathbb{R}$.**
  [[thm-baire-category-r]] says that $\mathbb{R}$ is not a countable union of
  nowhere dense sets. What is needed for Baire's theorem on functions of the
  first class ([[thm-baire-one-continuity-points]]) is the same statement
  *localised* to a closed bounded interval, and the localisation is not formal:
  a closed set may be nowhere dense in $\mathbb{R}$ and yet fill an interval, so
  the conclusion has to be stated as "contains a nondegenerate closed
  subinterval" rather than "has nonempty interior in $\mathbb{R}$". The two are
  in fact the same condition here, which is what step 2.1 uses.

- **The hypothesis $a < b$ is not decoration.** For $a = b$ the set $[a,b]$ is a
  single point, it is covered by the constant sequence $F_n = \{a\}$, and no
  $F_n$ contains a nondegenerate closed interval; the conclusion fails, and the
  proof breaks at step 3.1, where $(a,b)$ is empty.

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$, with
$|x|$ the absolute value ([[def-abs-value]]). Then

$$|x| \ge 0; \quad |x| = 0 \iff x = 0; \quad -|x| \le x \le |x|; \quad |-x| = |x|; \quad |xy| = |x|\,|y|;$$

and, for every $c > 0$, one has $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and elements $x, y \in F$.

[L1] Absolute value: $|u| = u$ if $u \ge 0$, and $|u| = -u$ if $u < 0$ ([[def-abs-value]]).

[L2] Ordered-field order: trichotomy holds (for each $u$ exactly one of $u > 0$, $u = 0$, $u < 0$), $a < b$ means $b - a$ is positive, and sums and products of positives are positive ([[def-ordered-field]]).

[L3] Signs in products: $(-a)b = -(ab)$ and $(-a)(-b) = ab$ ([[lem-of-mult-neg]]).

[L4] Sign rules: a product of two elements of the same sign is positive, and a product of two elements of opposite sign is negative ([[lem-of-sign-rules]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** cases.

1.1 Case $x > 0$: by [L1] $|x| = x > 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; since $-x < 0$ we get $|-x| = -(-x) = x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -x < 0 < x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case pos, L1, L2, algebra]

1.2 Case $x = 0$: then $|x| = |0| = 0$, so $|x| \ge 0$ holds with $|x| = 0$ and $x = 0$, while $|-x| = |0| = |x|$ and $-|x| = 0 \le 0 \le 0 = |x|$. [assume-case zero, L1]

1.3 Case $x < 0$: by [L1] $|x| = -x$, and [L2] gives $-x > 0$, so $|x| > 0$ and $|x| \ne 0$; here $|-x| = -x = |x|$ by [L1], and $-|x| = -(-x) = x \le x$ while $x < 0 < -x = |x|$, so $-|x| \le x \le |x|$. [assume-case neg, L1, L2, algebra]

1.4 Case $x = 0$ or $y = 0$: then $xy = 0$, so $|xy| = 0$, and one of $|x|, |y|$ is $0$, whence $|x|\,|y| = 0 = |xy|$. [assume-case zerofactor, L1]

1.5 Case $x, y$ have the same sign (both positive or both negative): by [L4] $xy > 0$, so $|xy| = xy$, while $|x|\,|y| = xy$ by [L3] (for $x, y < 0$ this is $(-x)(-y) = xy$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case same, L1, L3, L4]

1.6 Case $x, y$ have opposite signs (one positive, one negative): by [L4] $xy < 0$, so $|xy| = -(xy)$, while $|x|\,|y| = -(xy)$ by [L3] (namely $x(-y)$ or $(-x)y$), hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. [assume-case opposite, L1, L3, L4]

2.1 By trichotomy [L2] each $x$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.1-1.3, and in each we verified $|x| \ge 0$, that $|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$, that $|-x| = |x|$, and that $-|x| \le x \le |x|$; hence all four hold for every $x$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, cases-exhaustive]

2.2 By trichotomy [L2] each pair $x, y$ lies in exactly one of the cases 1.4-1.6, and in each $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; hence $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$ for all $x, y$. [step 1.4, step 1.5, step 1.6, cases-exhaustive]

3.1 Let $c > 0$: if $|x| < c$ then $-c < -|x| \le x \le |x| < c$ by [step 2.1] and [L2], so $-c < x < c$; conversely if $-c < x < c$ then both $x < c$ and $-x < c$, and since $|x|$ equals $x$ or $-x$ by [L1], we get $|x| < c$, so $|x| < c \iff -c < x < c$. [step 2.1, L1, L2] ∎

## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field, with field structure as in [[def-field]], and for
$n \ge 1$ let $n \cdot 1_F$ denote the canonical natural number
$\underbrace{1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_{n}$, defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$
and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$. Then for every $n \ge 1$:

- $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$;
- the map $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing, hence injective, on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$;
- $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ and $(mn) \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F)$ for all $m, n \ge 1$.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ whose canonical naturals are defined recursively by $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$ and $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$, with $0 \cdot 1_F = 0$.

[L1] $0 < 1_F$ in every ordered field ([[cor-of-one-positive]]).

[L2] The order is compatible with addition and positives are closed under addition: $a < b$ implies $a + c < b + c$, and $a > 0$, $b > 0$ imply $a + b > 0$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** induction.

1.1 Base case $n = 1$: by definition $1 \cdot 1_F = 1_F$, and $1_F > 0$. [L1, base]

1.2 Inductive hypothesis: assume $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for some fixed $n \ge 1$. [ih]

1.3 By the recursion, $(n+1) \cdot 1_F - n \cdot 1_F = 1_F > 0$, so $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > n \cdot 1_F$. [given, L1]

1.4 Additive identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m+1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ by the recursion, and if $(m+n) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F$ then $(m+n+1) \cdot 1_F = (m+n) \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + n \cdot 1_F + 1_F = m \cdot 1_F + (n+1) \cdot 1_F$. [given, algebra]

2.1 Inductive step: $(n+1) \cdot 1_F = n \cdot 1_F + 1_F$ is a sum of two positives, by the hypothesis and $1_F > 0$, hence $(n+1) \cdot 1_F > 0$. [step 1.2, L1, L2]

2.2 Iterating 1.3, for $m < n$ one has $m \cdot 1_F < n \cdot 1_F$, so $n \mapsto n \cdot 1_F$ is strictly increasing and therefore injective on $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$. [step 1.3, L2]

2.3 Multiplicative identity: fix $m$ and induct on $n$; at $n = 1$, $(m \cdot 1) \cdot 1_F = m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(1 \cdot 1_F)$, and the step $(m(n+1)) \cdot 1_F = (mn + m) \cdot 1_F = (mn) \cdot 1_F + m \cdot 1_F = (m \cdot 1_F)(n \cdot 1_F) + (m \cdot 1_F)(1_F) = (m \cdot 1_F)((n+1) \cdot 1_F)$ uses 1.4 and distributivity. [step 1.4, algebra]

3.1 By induction on 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, $n \cdot 1_F > 0$ for every $n \ge 1$; with the strict increase 2.2 and the identities 1.4, 2.3, every claim holds. [step 2.1, step 2.2, step 1.4, step 2.3, discharge-induction] ∎

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let
$\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\varepsilon > 0$. Put

$$E_\varepsilon \;:=\; \{\, x \in A : \omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon \,\}$$

([[def-oscillation]]). Then there is a **closed** $G \subseteq \mathbb{R}$
([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]) with

$$E_\varepsilon \;=\; A \cap G .$$

In particular, if $A = \mathbb{R}$ then $E_\varepsilon$ is itself a closed
subset of $\mathbb{R}$.

**The set $G$ is produced explicitly and does not depend on any choice**: it is
the complement of

$$U \;:=\; \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : \omega_f(A \cap N_\rho(y)) < \varepsilon \ \text{ for some real } \rho > 0 \,\},$$

which the proof shows to be open. Note that $y$ ranges over all of $\mathbb{R}$
here and not only over $A$; the expression $\omega_f(A \cap N_\rho(y))$ is the
oscillation of $f$ on a subset of $A$ and makes sense for every real $y$, taking
the value $\sup \varnothing = -\infty$ when $A \cap N_\rho(y) = \varnothing$
([[def-oscillation]], [[lem-extended-reals-complete]]).

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$, and a real $\varepsilon > 0$.

[L1] $\omega_f(S) = \sup\{|f(x) - f(y)| : x, y \in S\}$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, and $\omega_f(S) \le \omega_f(T)$ whenever $S \subseteq T \subseteq A$; for $c \in A$, $\omega_f(c) = \inf\{\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(c)) : \delta > 0\}$ ([[def-oscillation]], [[def-extended-reals]]).

[L2] In $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ every subset has a greatest lower bound; an infimum is $\ge$ an extended real $\ell$ exactly when $\ell$ bounds the set from below, and the infimum is $\le$ every member of the set ([[lem-extended-reals-complete]]).

[L3] $N_\delta(x) = \{y : |y - x| < \delta\}$; if $|y - x| < \rho/2$ then $N_{\rho/2}(y) \subseteq N_\rho(x)$, since $|z - y| < \rho/2$ gives $|z - x| \le |z - y| + |y - x| < \rho$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L4] $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is open when every point of $U$ has a neighbourhood contained in $U$, and $G \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is closed exactly when $\mathbb{R} \setminus G$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Define $U := \{\, y \in \mathbb{R} : \omega_f(A \cap N_\rho(y)) < \varepsilon$ for some real $\rho > 0 \,\}$ and $G := \mathbb{R} \setminus U$. [construct]

2.1 $U$ is open. Let $y \in U$ with witness $\rho > 0$, and let $z \in N_{\rho/2}(y)$. Then $N_{\rho/2}(z) \subseteq N_\rho(y)$, hence $A \cap N_{\rho/2}(z) \subseteq A \cap N_\rho(y)$, hence $\omega_f(A \cap N_{\rho/2}(z)) \le \omega_f(A \cap N_\rho(y)) < \varepsilon$, so $z \in U$ with witness $\rho/2$. Thus $N_{\rho/2}(y) \subseteq U$. [step 1.1, L1, L3, L4]

2.2 Let $x \in A$ with $x \notin U$. Then $\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(x)) \ge \varepsilon$ for every real $\delta > 0$, so $\varepsilon$ is a lower bound of the set whose infimum is $\omega_f(x)$, and therefore $\omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon$, that is $x \in E_\varepsilon$. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

2.3 Let $x \in E_\varepsilon$, so $x \in A$ and $\omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon$. For every real $\delta > 0$ the value $\omega_f(A \cap N_\delta(x))$ is at least the infimum $\omega_f(x)$, hence at least $\varepsilon$; so no $\rho$ witnesses membership of $x$ in $U$, that is $x \notin U$. [step 1.1, L1, L2]

3.1 $G$ is closed, being the complement of the open set $U$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, L4]

4.1 Steps 2.2 and 2.3 together say that for $x \in A$ one has $x \in E_\varepsilon$ if and only if $x \in G$; hence $E_\varepsilon = A \cap G$ with $G$ closed. [step 3.1, step 2.2, step 2.3]

5.1 If $A = \mathbb{R}$ then $E_\varepsilon = \mathbb{R} \cap G = G$ is closed in $\mathbb{R}$. [step 4.1, L4] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the strict inequality is on the open side.** The set $U$ is defined by a
  strict inequality and an existential quantifier over $\rho$, which is what
  makes it open; its complement is then closed, and the superlevel set
  $\{\omega_f \ge \varepsilon\}$ is what remains of it inside $A$. Defining
  $E_\varepsilon$ with a strict inequality instead, as
  $\{\omega_f > \varepsilon\}$, would not give a closed set in general, and the
  exhaustion of [[thm-discontinuity-set-is-f-sigma]] is arranged so that only the
  non-strict form is ever needed.

- **The relative form is the honest one.** For general $A$ the set
  $E_\varepsilon$ is a subset of $A$ and there is no reason for it to be closed
  in $\mathbb{R}$: taking $A = (0,1)$ and $f$ the restriction of a function with
  oscillation $\ge \varepsilon$ everywhere gives $E_\varepsilon = (0,1)$, which
  is not closed. What is always true is the displayed identity
  $E_\varepsilon = A \cap G$, and that is what the theorems downstream use.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$, let
$\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in A$. Suppose $f$ and $g$ are continuous at
$c$ ([[def-continuity-real]]). Then:

1. $f + g$, $\alpha f$ and $fg$ are continuous at $c$;
2. $|f|$, the function $x \mapsto |f(x)|$, is continuous at $c$;
3. $\max\{f,g\}$ and $\min\{f,g\}$, defined pointwise by
   $x \mapsto \max\{f(x), g(x)\}$ and $x \mapsto \min\{f(x), g(x)\}$
   ([[def-max-min]]), are continuous at $c$;
4. if $g(c) \ne 0$ then, writing $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$, the
   point $c$ lies in $A_0$ and the quotient
   $(f/g)|_{A_0} : A_0 \to \mathbb{R}$, $x \mapsto f(x)/g(x)$, is continuous at
   $c$ as a function on $A_0$.

Moreover, with no hypothesis at all:

5. every constant function $A \to \mathbb{R}$ and the identity
   $\mathrm{id} : A \to \mathbb{R}$, $x \mapsto x$, are continuous on $A$; hence
   so is $x \mapsto x^{n}$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$
   ([[def-integer-power]]), and hence so is every **polynomial function**
   $x \mapsto a_0 + a_1 x + \dots + a_n x^{n}$ with real coefficients.

Consequently, if $f$ and $g$ are continuous **on** $A$ then so are $f+g$,
$\alpha f$, $fg$, $|f|$, $\max\{f,g\}$ and $\min\{f,g\}$, and
$(f/g)|_{A_0}$ is continuous on $A_0$.

**Claim 4 is stated on $A_0$ because $f/g$ is not defined where $g$ vanishes**,
and $g$ may well vanish at points of $A$ far from $c$. The hypothesis is
$g(c) \ne 0$, not "$g$ nowhere zero"; what it buys is that $c$ itself lies in
the smaller domain, which is what makes continuity there mean anything.

**Nothing here is proved through a sequence.** Claims 1 and 4 are read off from
[[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]], which is itself proved from $\varepsilon$
and $\delta$, and claims 2, 3 and 5 are proved directly below. So no choice
principle is used anywhere in this item.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, functions $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$, a real $\alpha$, a point $c \in A$ at which $f$ and $g$ are continuous, and, for claim 4, the hypothesis $g(c) \ne 0$ together with $A_0 := \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$.

[L1] Continuity at $c$: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that every $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ satisfies $|f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ ([[def-continuity-real]]).

[L2] A point of $A$ is either a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point of $A$, and never both; at an isolated point of its domain every function is continuous; at a limit point $c$ of $A$, continuity of $f$ at $c$ is exactly the statement that the limit of $f$ at $c$ exists and equals $f(c)$ ([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-limit-point-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]], [[def-function-limit]]).

[L3] Algebra of function limits at a limit point $c$ of $A$: if the limits of $f$ and $g$ at $c$ exist with values $L$ and $M$, then the limits of $f+g$, $\alpha f$ and $fg$ at $c$ exist with values $L+M$, $\alpha L$ and $LM$; and if $M \ne 0$ then $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$, and the limit of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$ exists and equals $L/M$ ([[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]]).

[L4] Sign preservation: if the limit of $g$ at a limit point $c$ of $A$ exists and is nonzero, then $c$ is a limit point of $A_0 = \{\, x \in A : g(x) \ne 0 \,\}$ ([[lem-sign-preservation-near-a-limit]]).

[L5] Reverse triangle inequality: $\bigl||u| - |v|\bigr| \le |u - v|$ ([[cor-of-reverse-triangle]]); and $|u| \ge 0$, $|u| = 0$ exactly when $u = 0$, $|uv| = |u||v|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L6] Maximum and minimum of a two-element set of reals exist ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]), and for all reals $u, v$ one has $\max\{u,v\} = \tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(u + v + |u-v|\bigr)$ and $\min\{u,v\} = \tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(u + v - |u-v|\bigr)$.

[L7] Ordered-field arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: trichotomy and totality of the order, the field identities, and $0 < 1$ so that $2 \ne 0$ and $t/2$ is defined ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]).

[L8] Integer powers: $a^{0} = 1$ and $a^{n+1} = a^{n} \cdot a$ ([[def-integer-power]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **Justification of the identity in [L6].** Let $u, v \in \mathbb{R}$. By totality either $u \ge v$ or $v \ge u$. If $u \ge v$ then $u - v \ge 0$, so $|u-v| = u-v$ and $\tfrac{1}{2}(u+v+|u-v|) = \tfrac{1}{2}(2u) = u = \max\{u,v\}$, while $\tfrac{1}{2}(u+v-|u-v|) = v = \min\{u,v\}$. If $v \ge u$ the same computation with the roles exchanged applies, since $|u-v| = v-u$ there. [L5, L6, L7]

1.2 **The isolated case.** Suppose $c$ is an isolated point of $A$, say $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ with $\eta > 0$ real. Then every function on $A$ is continuous at $c$ by [L2], which gives claims 1, 2 and 3 at once. For claim 4, assume $g(c) \ne 0$; then $c \in A_0$, and $N_{\eta}(c) \cap A_0 \subseteq N_{\eta}(c) \cap A = \{c\}$ with $c$ in the left-hand side, so $c$ is an isolated point of $A_0$ and every function on $A_0$, in particular $(f/g)|_{A_0}$, is continuous at $c$. [L2]

1.3 **Claim 2, at any point of $A$.** Let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given and let $\delta > 0$ be as in [L1] for $f$ and this $\varepsilon$. For $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ the reverse triangle inequality gives $\bigl||f(x)| - |f(c)|\bigr| \le |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$. So $|f|$ is continuous at $c$, and no case distinction was needed. [L1, L5]

1.4 **Claim 5, constants and the identity.** If $f$ is constant then $|f(x) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$ for every $x \in A$ and every real $\varepsilon > 0$, so any $\delta > 0$ serves. For the identity, given a real $\varepsilon > 0$ take $\delta := \varepsilon$: every $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ has $|\mathrm{id}(x) - \mathrm{id}(c)| = |x - c| < \varepsilon$. Both are continuous at every point of $A$. [L1, L5, L7]

1.5 **The limit-point case, claim 1.** Suppose $c$ is a limit point of $A$. By [L2] the limits of $f$ and of $g$ at $c$ exist and equal $f(c)$ and $g(c)$. By [L3] the limits of $f+g$, $\alpha f$ and $fg$ at $c$ exist and equal $f(c)+g(c)$, $\alpha f(c)$ and $f(c)g(c)$, which are exactly the values of those three functions at $c$; by [L2] again, each of them is continuous at $c$. [L2, L3]

1.6 **The limit-point case, claim 4.** Suppose $c$ is a limit point of $A$ and $g(c) \ne 0$. Then $c \in A_0$, and by [L4] the point $c$ is a limit point of $A_0$. By [L3] the limit of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$ exists and equals $f(c)/g(c)$, which is the value of $(f/g)|_{A_0}$ at $c$; by [L2] applied on the domain $A_0$, that function is continuous at $c$. [L2, L3, L4]

2.1 **Claims 1 and 4 in general.** By [L2] the point $c$ is either isolated in $A$ or a limit point of $A$; step 1.2 settles the first case and steps 1.5 and 1.6 the second. So claims 1 and 4 hold as stated. [step 1.2, step 1.5, step 1.6, L2]

3.1 **Claim 3.** By claim 1 the function $f - g = f + (-1)g$ is continuous at $c$, by step 1.3 so is $|f-g|$, and by claim 1 again so are $f + g + |f-g|$ and its scalar multiple by $1/2$. By step 1.1 that scalar multiple is the function $x \mapsto \max\{f(x), g(x)\}$, so the maximum is continuous at $c$; the same argument with $-|f-g|$ gives the minimum. [step 1.1, step 1.3, step 2.1, L6, L7]

3.2 **Claim 5, powers and polynomials.** The map $x \mapsto x^{0}$ is the constant $1$ and $x \mapsto x^{1}$ is the identity, both continuous on $A$ by step 1.4; and if $x \mapsto x^{n}$ is continuous on $A$ then so is $x \mapsto x^{n+1} = x^{n} \cdot x$, being a product of two functions continuous on $A$ by step 2.1. By induction on $n$, $x \mapsto x^{n}$ is continuous on $A$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. A polynomial function $a_0 + a_1x + \dots + a_nx^{n}$ is obtained from these by finitely many scalar multiplications and additions, each of which preserves continuity by step 2.1. [step 1.4, step 2.1, L8]

4.1 Claims 1 to 5 are proved, all of them at an arbitrary point $c$ of $A$ and therefore, applied at every point, on the whole of $A$; and no sequence and no choice principle was used. [step 1.3, step 2.1, step 3.1, step 3.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the two-case shape, and why it is not an inconvenience.** Continuity is defined at every point of the domain, including isolated points, where no limit exists ([[def-continuity-real]]). The algebra of limits therefore cannot be applied blindly; but at an isolated point every function is continuous, so the case is settled before it is opened. Claims 2 and 5 are proved directly from $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ and need no case distinction at all.

- **Absolute value, maximum and minimum are not in [[thm-algebra-of-function-limits]]**, and the reason is that they are not needed there. They are needed here: the extreme value theorem and the one-dimensional fixed point theorem both build auxiliary functions out of maxima, minima and differences, and [[thm-compactness-is-necessary-for-evt-and-uniform-continuity]] builds its witnesses out of $|x - x_0|$ and quotients.

- **The converse of claim 2 is false**: $|f|$ may be continuous while $f$ is continuous nowhere. The function equal to $1$ on $\mathbb{Q}$ and to $-1$ elsewhere has constant absolute value; that it is nowhere continuous follows from the argument of [[cex-dirichlet-is-nowhere-continuous]] applied verbatim, since that argument uses only that the two values are distinct.

## Statement

Let $C$ be the Cantor set ([[def-cantor-set]]). Then:

1. $C$ is closed and bounded, hence compact
   ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]]);
2. $C$ has content zero, and therefore measure zero
   ([[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]);
3. $C$ is perfect ([[def-perfect-set-r]]);
4. $C$ is uncountable ([[def-countable]]);
5. $C$ contains no interval with two distinct endpoints, and is nowhere dense
   ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]]);
6. every nonempty connected subset of $C$ ([[def-connected-r]]) is a single
   point.

Claim 6 is what the phrase "totally disconnected" names elsewhere; that phrase
is **not** used here, because no definition of total disconnectedness exists at
this point in the reading order. What is proved is exactly the displayed
statement, and it is obtained from claim 5 through
[[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]].

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** The sets $C_n$ and $C$ of [[def-cantor-set]], and the map $\Phi$ and the set $D$ of $\{0,2\}$-valued sequences of [[thm-cantor-set-ternary-description]].

[L1] $C_0 = [0,1]$, $C_{n+1} = \tfrac13 C_n \cup (\tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C_n)$, $C = \bigcap_n C_n \subseteq C_m$ for every $m$, every $C_n \subseteq [0,1]$, $0 \in C$, and $3^{-n} = (3^{-1})^n$ ([[def-cantor-set]], [[def-interval]], [[def-integer-power]], [[lem-power-laws]]).

[L2] $\Phi$ is a bijection from $D$ onto $C$, $\Phi(a) = \sum_{k \ge 0} a_k 3^{-k-1}$, and convergent series add and scale termwise ([[thm-cantor-set-ternary-description]], [[lem-series-linearity]], [[def-series]]).

[L3] $[c,d]$ is a closed set and a bounded interval, $(c,d)$ is open, $N_\varepsilon(x) = (x-\varepsilon, x+\varepsilon)$, and every open set contains a neighbourhood of each of its points ([[def-interval]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L4] Finite unions of closed sets are closed, and an intersection of a nonempty family of closed sets is closed ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]).

[L5] A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is compact exactly when it is closed and bounded ([[thm-heine-borel-characterisation-r]], [[def-open-cover-r]]).

[L6] Content zero and measure zero as in [[def-measure-zero-and-content-zero]]; a set of content zero is null ([[lem-content-zero-implies-null]]); no null set contains an interval $[u,v]$ with $u < v$ ([[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]]).

[L7] $P$ is perfect when it is closed and no point of it is isolated in it ([[def-perfect-set-r]], [[def-limit-point-r]]); every nonempty perfect subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable ([[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]], [[def-countable]]).

[L8] A set is nowhere dense exactly when the interior of its closure is empty, and a closed set equals its closure ([[def-nowhere-dense-meager]], [[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-closure-characterisations-r]]).

[L9] A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is connected exactly when it is order-convex ([[thm-connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals]], [[def-connected-r]], [[def-interval]]).

[L10] $|r|^k \to 0$ for $|r| < 1$ ([[lem-geometric-sequence-null]]); convergence to $0$ is tested against rational $\varepsilon > 0$ ([[def-real-limit]]); $|z| \ge 0$, $|z| = z$ for $z \ge 0$, and $|uv| = |u||v|$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L11] Induction on $\mathbb{N}$ ([[thm-induction-principle]]); finite sums split, scale and are monotone in their terms ([[def-finite-sum]], [[lem-finite-sum-laws]]).

[L12] Ordered-field arithmetic: $0 < 1$, so $2 > 0$, $3 > 0$, $3^{-1} > 0$ and $0 < 2 \cdot 3^{-1} < 1$; adding a constant and multiplying by a positive preserve an inequality; the order is total and transitive ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-sign-rules]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]). These order-arithmetic facts are stated by their sources for the strict order only; the nonstrict forms used below follow by adjoining the equality case, in which the two sides coincide.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **$C$ is compact, claim 1.** First, for $\lambda \ne 0$ and $c \in \mathbb{R}$ the set $\lambda S + c := \{\lambda s + c : s \in S\}$ is closed whenever $S$ is: if $x \notin \lambda S + c$ then $(x - c)\lambda^{-1} \notin S$, so by [L3] there is a real $\eta > 0$ with $N_\eta((x-c)\lambda^{-1}) \cap S = \varnothing$, and every $z$ with $|z - x| < |\lambda|\eta$ satisfies $|(z-c)\lambda^{-1} - (x-c)\lambda^{-1}| = |z-x| \cdot |\lambda|^{-1} < \eta$ by [L10] and [L12], hence $(z-c)\lambda^{-1} \notin S$ and $z \notin \lambda S + c$. Now every $C_n$ is closed, by induction on $n$ ([L11]): $C_0 = [0,1]$ is closed by [L3], and $C_{n+1}$ is the union of the two closed sets $\tfrac13 C_n$ and $\tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C_n$, hence closed by [L4]. So $C = \bigcap_n C_n$ is closed by [L4], and $C \subseteq [0,1]$ is bounded by [L1] and [L3]; by [L5] it is compact. [L1, L3, L4, L5, L10, L11, L12]

1.2 **$C$ has content zero and measure zero, claim 2.** By induction on $n$ ([L11]) the following holds for every $n$: there are $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and reals $u_0 \le v_0, \dots, u_m \le v_m$ with $C_n \subseteq \bigcup_{j \le m}[u_j,v_j]$ and $\sum_{j \le m}(v_j - u_j) = (2 \cdot 3^{-1})^{n}$. At $n = 0$ take the single interval $[0,1]$, of total length $1 = (2 \cdot 3^{-1})^0$ by [L1]. Given such a list at $n$, define $2m + 2$ intervals by $[u_j 3^{-1},\, v_j 3^{-1}]$ for $j \le m$ and $[2 \cdot 3^{-1} + u_{j-m-1}3^{-1},\, 2 \cdot 3^{-1} + v_{j-m-1}3^{-1}]$ for $m < j \le 2m+1$; they cover $\tfrac13 C_n$ and $\tfrac23 + \tfrac13 C_n$ respectively, hence cover $C_{n+1}$, and their total length is $3^{-1}(2 \cdot 3^{-1})^{n} + 3^{-1}(2 \cdot 3^{-1})^{n} = (2 \cdot 3^{-1})^{n+1}$ by [L11] and [L12]. Since $0 < 2 \cdot 3^{-1} < 1$ by [L12], [L10] gives, for every real $\varepsilon > 0$, an $n$ with $(2 \cdot 3^{-1})^{n} \le \varepsilon$; as $C \subseteq C_n$ by [L1], the corresponding finite list covers $C$ with total length at most $\varepsilon$. So $C$ has content zero by [L6], and hence measure zero by [L6]. [L1, L6, L10, L11, L12]

2.1 **$C$ is perfect, claim 3.** $C$ is closed by step 1.1. Let $x \in C$ and let the real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. By [L2] write $x = \Phi(a)$ with $a \in D$. By [L10] and [L12] fix $k \in \mathbb{N}$ with $2 \cdot 3^{-k-1} < \varepsilon$, and define $b \in D$ by $b_j := a_j$ for $j \ne k$ and $b_k := 2 - a_k$, so $b_k \in \{0,2\}$ and $b \ne a$. Then $\Phi(b) \in C$ and $\Phi(b) \ne \Phi(a)$ by [L2], while $\Phi(b) - \Phi(a) = \sum_{j \ge 0}(b_j - a_j)3^{-j-1} = (b_k - a_k)3^{-k-1}$ by [L2], all other terms being $0$, so $|\Phi(b) - x| = 2 \cdot 3^{-k-1} < \varepsilon$ by [L10]. Thus $N_\varepsilon(x)$ contains a point of $C$ other than $x$, for every $\varepsilon$, so $x$ is not isolated in $C$; by [L7] $C$ is perfect. [step 1.1, L2, L7, L10, L12]

2.2 **$C$ contains no nondegenerate interval and is nowhere dense, claim 5.** By step 1.2 the set $C$ is null, so by [L6] it contains no $[u,v]$ with $u < v$; in particular it contains no interval of any of the four bounded forms with distinct endpoints, since such an interval contains a closed one with distinct endpoints by [L6] and [L12]. Its interior is therefore empty: if $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq C$ for some real $\varepsilon > 0$, then $[x - \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1},\, x + \varepsilon \cdot 2^{-1}] \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq C$ by [L3] and [L12], an interval with distinct endpoints. Since $C$ is closed by step 1.1, it equals its closure, so [L8] gives that $C$ is nowhere dense. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L3, L6, L8, L12]

3.1 **$C$ is uncountable, claim 4.** $C$ is nonempty, since $0 \in C$ by [L1], and perfect by step 2.1, so [L7] applies. [step 2.1, L1, L7]

3.2 **Connected subsets, claim 6.** Let $E \subseteq C$ be connected and nonempty. By [L9] $E$ is order-convex, so if $u, v \in E$ with $u < v$ then $[u,v] \subseteq E \subseteq C$, contradicting step 2.2. Hence no two distinct elements of $E$ exist, and $E$, being nonempty, is a single point. [step 2.2, L9, L12]

4.1 Claims 1 to 6 are steps 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 3.1, 2.2 and 3.2 respectively, so all six hold. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, step 3.2] ∎

## Remarks

- **Two independent proofs of uncountability.** The route above is [[thm-perfect-set-uncountable-r]] applied to a nonempty perfect set. The other is claim 3 of [[thm-cantor-set-ternary-description]]: $C$ is in bijection with $\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$, which is in bijection with the power set of $\mathbb{N}$, uncountable by [[thm-cantor-powerset]]. The two arguments share nothing, and the second is the one that makes the *size* of $C$ evident: $C$ is in bijection with the power set of $\mathbb{N}$, while having content zero. **It is deliberately not said here that $C$ has as many points as $\mathbb{R}$.** That would require a bijection between $\mathbb{R}$ and the power set of $\mathbb{N}$, and no such bijection is constructed anywhere at this point in the reading order; the two uncountability results available here are separate facts, one proved by the diagonal argument on power sets and one by nested intervals.

- **Claim 2 and claim 4 together are the point of the whole construction.** A set of measure zero may be uncountable, so nullity is not a cardinality condition; and a nowhere dense set need not be null, so it is not a category condition either ([[fs-nowhere-dense-implies-measure-zero]], [[thm-fat-cantor-set-has-positive-measure]]).

- **Why claim 5 is proved through measure and not by inspection.** The intervals making up $C_n$ have length $3^{-n}$, and one can see directly that a long interval cannot fit inside $C$. Doing that rigorously means keeping track of the $2^n$ component intervals of $C_n$ and their gaps; going through [[lem-nondegenerate-interval-is-not-null]] uses the estimate already made in step 1.2 and needs no such bookkeeping.

- **Every point of $C$ is a limit of other points of $C$, and the witnesses are explicit**: change one ternary digit far out, as step 2.1 does. This is also what shows $C$ has no isolated points without any appeal to the structure of its complement.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with closure $\overline{A}$ as in
[[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]] and derived set $A'$ as in
[[def-limit-point-r]]. Write

$$E \;:=\; \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A \ne \varnothing \text{ for every real } \varepsilon > 0 \,\}$$

for the set of adherent points of $A$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]). Then:

1. $\overline{A} = E$.
2. $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$.
3. $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed superset of $A$: it is closed, it
   contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed $F$ with $A \subseteq F$.
4. $A$ is closed if and only if $A = \overline{A}$, if and only if
   $A' \subseteq A$.

Claim 3 is the content of the definition of $\overline{A}$ and is restated here
so that the four descriptions stand together; claims 1, 2 and 4 are the ones
that carry work.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, and the set $E$ of adherent points of $A$ as displayed in the Statement.

[L1] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; $F$ is closed when $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L2] $x \in N_\varepsilon(x)$; $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) = N_\varepsilon(x) \setminus \{x\} \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$; and if $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ then $\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x| > 0$ and $N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] $\overline{A}$ is the intersection of the nonempty family of closed supersets of $A$; it is closed, it contains $A$, and it is contained in every closed superset of $A$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-r]], [[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]).

[L4] $x$ is an adherent point of $A$ when every $N_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $A$, a limit point when every $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x)$ meets $A$, and $A'$ is the set of limit points ([[def-limit-point-r]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 $A \subseteq E$: for $x \in A$ and any $\varepsilon > 0$ one has $x \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$, so that intersection is nonempty. [L2, L4]

1.2 Let $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus E$; by the definition of $E$ there is a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A = \varnothing$. [L4, choose]

1.3 Let $F$ be closed with $A \subseteq F$, and let $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus F$; since $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open there is a real $\eta > 0$ with $N_\eta(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus F$. [L1, choose]

2.1 For every $y \in N_\varepsilon(x)$ the radius $\delta := \varepsilon - |y - x|$ is positive and $N_\delta(y) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$, so $N_\delta(y) \cap A = \varnothing$ and $y \notin E$; hence $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$, and since $x$ was an arbitrary point of $\mathbb{R} \setminus E$ that set is open, that is, $E$ is closed. [step 1.2, L1, L2, L4]

2.2 From $N_\eta(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus F \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus A$ we get $N_\eta(x) \cap A = \varnothing$, so $x \notin E$; hence $\mathbb{R} \setminus F \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$, that is, $E \subseteq F$, for every closed $F \supseteq A$. [step 1.3, L4]

3.1 By steps 1.1 and 2.1 the set $E$ is a closed superset of $A$, so $\overline{A} \subseteq E$ by the leastness in [L3]; and $\overline{A}$ is itself a closed superset of $A$ by [L3], so step 2.2 applied to $F = \overline{A}$ gives $E \subseteq \overline{A}$. Hence $\overline{A} = E$, which is claim 1. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, L3]

4.1 $E = A \cup A'$: if $x \in E$ and $x \notin A$ then for every $\varepsilon > 0$ some $a \in N_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ exists, and $a \ne x$ because $x \notin A$, so $a \in N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \cap A$ and $x \in A'$; conversely $A \subseteq E$ by step 1.1, and $A' \subseteq E$ because $N^{*}_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$. Combining with step 3.1 gives $\overline{A} = A \cup A'$, which is claim 2. [step 1.1, step 3.1, L2, L4]

5.1 Claim 4: if $A$ is closed then $A$ is a closed superset of itself, so $\overline{A} \subseteq A$ by [L3], while $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ by [L3], whence $A = \overline{A}$; conversely if $A = \overline{A}$ then $A$ is closed because $\overline{A}$ is. Finally $A = \overline{A}$ says $A = A \cup A'$ by step 4.1, and $A = A \cup A'$ holds exactly when $A' \subseteq A$. [step 4.1, L3]

6.1 Claim 3 is [L3] restated, and claims 1, 2 and 4 are steps 3.1, 4.1 and 5.1, so all four hold. [step 3.1, step 4.1, step 5.1, L3] ∎

## Remarks

- **Which claim does the work in practice.** Claim 1 is the one used almost
  everywhere below: to show a point lies in $\overline{A}$ one exhibits, for each
  $\varepsilon > 0$, a point of $A$ within $\varepsilon$ of it. Claim 2 is what
  separates the two ways a point can be adherent, by membership or by
  accumulation, and it is what makes the notion of an isolated point visible.

- **No special property of $\mathbb{R}$ is used.** The argument uses the
  definitions of open, closed, neighbourhood and closure, and the order enters
  only through the nesting property of neighbourhoods; neither the
  least-upper-bound property nor the Archimedean property appears at any step.
  The results of this page that do use them are flagged in
  [[rem-r-native-topology-scope]].

- **The sequential form is a separate theorem and costs more.** Replacing
  "every neighbourhood meets $A$" by "some sequence in $A$ converges to $x$" is
  [[lem-sequential-characterisation-of-closure-r]], and the passage from the
  first to the second spends the axiom of countable choice, since it selects one
  point of $A$ from each of infinitely many neighbourhoods. The characterisation
  proved above is choice free.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$. Call a set
$S \subseteq A$ **relatively open in $A$** when $S = U \cap A$ for some open
$U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, and **relatively closed in $A$** when $S = G \cap A$
for some closed $G \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]). For
$V \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ write $f^{-1}(V) := \{\, x \in A : f(x) \in V \,\}$.
Then the following are equivalent.

1. $f$ is continuous on $A$ ([[def-continuity-real]]).
2. $f^{-1}(V)$ is relatively open in $A$ for every open $V \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.
3. $f^{-1}(F)$ is relatively closed in $A$ for every closed $F \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

**"Relatively open" is defined here inline, and on purpose.** At this point in
the reading order this library has no subspace-topology item for $\mathbb{R}$,
and the metric one ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]) may not be reached
before [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]] has said that the two vocabularies
agree, which is later on this page. The phrase above is therefore an
abbreviation for the displayed condition and nothing more.

**The preimage is taken inside $A$.** $f^{-1}(V)$ is a subset of $A$, never of
$\mathbb{R}$, so claim 2 does **not** say that preimages of open sets are open.
They are open only when $A$ is itself open: then $U \cap A$ is an intersection
of two open sets, hence open ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]). For $A = [0,1]$ and
$f$ the identity, $f^{-1}\bigl((-1,1/2)\bigr) = [0,1/2)$ is not open, and it is
the trace on $A$ of the open set $(-1,1/2)$.

**No choice principle is used.** The open set witnessing claim 2 is not selected
point by point; it is *constructed* as a single union over a family cut out by a
property, which is the device the proof below makes explicit.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$; for $V \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, $f^{-1}(V) = \{\, x \in A : f(x) \in V \,\}$.

[L1] Continuity of $f$ at $c \in A$: for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ with $|f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$ for every $x \in A$ satisfying $|x - c| < \delta$; equivalently $f\bigl(A \cap N_{\delta}(c)\bigr) \subseteq N_{\varepsilon}(f(c))$ ([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L2] Open sets of $\mathbb{R}$: $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ has some $N_{\varepsilon}(x) \subseteq U$; every neighbourhood $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ is itself open; a set is closed exactly when its complement is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]], [[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] An arbitrary union of open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ is open ([[thm-open-set-algebra-r]]).

[L4] Set algebra: for $V \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ one has $f^{-1}(\mathbb{R} \setminus V) = A \setminus f^{-1}(V)$; and for $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, $A \setminus (U \cap A) = (\mathbb{R} \setminus U) \cap A$.

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 **From 1 to 2: the canonical witness.** Assume $f$ is continuous on $A$ and let $V \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be open. Define $$U \;:=\; \bigcup \bigl\{\, N_{\delta}(x) \ : \ x \in f^{-1}(V),\ \delta \in \mathbb{R},\ \delta > 0,\ f\bigl(A \cap N_{\delta}(x)\bigr) \subseteq V \,\bigr\}.$$ The family being united is cut out by a property of the pair $(x,\delta)$, so it is a set and nothing is selected from it. Each of its members is open by [L2], so $U$ is open by [L3]. [L2, L3]

1.2 **$f^{-1}(V) \subseteq U \cap A$.** Let $x \in f^{-1}(V)$, so $x \in A$ and $f(x) \in V$. Since $V$ is open, [L2] gives a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_{\varepsilon}(f(x)) \subseteq V$, and continuity at $x$ gives, by [L1], a real $\delta > 0$ with $f\bigl(A \cap N_{\delta}(x)\bigr) \subseteq N_{\varepsilon}(f(x)) \subseteq V$. So this pair $(x,\delta)$ contributes $N_{\delta}(x)$ to the union, and $x \in N_{\delta}(x)$ by [L2]. Hence $x \in U$, and $x \in A$. [L1, L2]

1.3 **From 2 to 1.** Assume claim 2, let $c \in A$ and let a real $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. The set $V := N_{\varepsilon}(f(c))$ is open by [L2], so $f^{-1}(V) = U \cap A$ for some open $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Since $|f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \varepsilon$ we have $c \in f^{-1}(V)$, hence $c \in U$, and [L2] gives a real $\delta > 0$ with $N_{\delta}(c) \subseteq U$. Every $x \in A$ with $|x - c| < \delta$ then lies in $U \cap A = f^{-1}(V)$, so $f(x) \in N_{\varepsilon}(f(c))$, that is $|f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$. As $c$ and $\varepsilon$ were arbitrary, $f$ is continuous on $A$. [L1, L2]

2.1 **$U \cap A \subseteq f^{-1}(V)$.** Let $y \in U \cap A$. Then $y \in N_{\delta}(x)$ for some pair $(x,\delta)$ occurring in the union, so $y \in A \cap N_{\delta}(x)$ and therefore $f(y) \in V$ by the defining property of that pair. Hence $y \in f^{-1}(V)$. [step 1.1]

3.1 **Claim 2 holds.** By steps 1.2 and 2.1, $f^{-1}(V) = U \cap A$ with $U$ open, so $f^{-1}(V)$ is relatively open in $A$; and $V$ was an arbitrary open subset of $\mathbb{R}$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.1]

4.1 **2 and 3 are equivalent.** Let $F \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be closed and put $V := \mathbb{R} \setminus F$, which is open by [L2]. If claim 2 holds then $f^{-1}(V) = U \cap A$ with $U$ open, and by [L4] $$f^{-1}(F) = A \setminus f^{-1}(V) = A \setminus (U \cap A) = (\mathbb{R} \setminus U) \cap A ,$$ with $\mathbb{R} \setminus U$ closed by [L2]; so $f^{-1}(F)$ is relatively closed. The converse runs the same computation in the other direction, starting from an open $V$, putting $F := \mathbb{R} \setminus V$ and using $f^{-1}(V) = A \setminus f^{-1}(F)$. [step 3.1, L2, L4]

5.1 Statements 1, 2 and 3 are therefore equivalent, and the passage from 1 to 2 selected nothing. [step 3.1, step 1.3, step 4.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Why the union, and not a choice of $\delta$ at each point.** The textbook proof says "for each $x \in f^{-1}(V)$ pick $\delta_x$", which is a choice function on a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that may be uncountable. Nothing in this library licenses that. Uniting *all* admissible balls avoids the issue completely: the family is defined by a property, membership of $x$ in $U$ needs only the existence of one admissible $\delta$ for that single $x$, and the reverse inclusion needs only the defining property of whichever pair happens to catch $y$.

- **The dual form is not "preimages of closed sets are closed".** As with claim 2, the preimage lives in $A$, and it is relatively closed. The image direction fails outright: a continuous function may carry a closed set to a set that is not closed, which is [[fs-continuous-image-of-a-closed-set-is-closed]].

- **This is the statement that survives when $\mathbb{R}$ is replaced by a metric space or a topological space.** The metric version at this point in the reading order is [[def-metric-topology]] together with [[def-metric-continuity]], and the agreement of the two vocabularies for $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is [[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]], later on this page.

## Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$. Write

$$D \;:=\; \{\, x \in A : f \text{ is discontinuous at } x \,\}, \qquad C \;:=\; A \setminus D$$

([[def-continuity-real]], [[def-classification-of-discontinuities]]). Then:

1. **Pointwise exhaustion.** $D = \{\, x \in A : \omega_f(x) > 0 \,\}$
   ([[def-oscillation]]), and $D$ is the union of the increasing sequence of
   superlevel sets
   $$D \;=\; \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \{\, x \in A : \omega_f(x) \ge 1/\iota(n+1) \,\}$$
   ([[def-canonical-natural]]), whose thresholds are $1, 1/2, 1/3, \dots$.
2. **Descriptive form.** There is an $F_\sigma$ set $F \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and
   a $G_\delta$ set $V \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ ([[def-f-sigma-g-delta]]) with
   $$D \;=\; A \cap F, \qquad C \;=\; A \cap V, \qquad V = \mathbb{R} \setminus F ,$$
   and $F$ may be taken to be $\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} G_n$ with each $G_n$ a
   closed subset of $\mathbb{R}$ cutting down on $A$ to the $n$-th set of
   claim 1 ([[lem-oscillation-superlevel-sets-are-closed]]).

In particular, when $A = \mathbb{R}$ the discontinuity set $D$ is an $F_\sigma$
subset of $\mathbb{R}$ and the continuity set $C$ is a $G_\delta$ subset, and
claim 1 reads $D = \bigcup_{n} \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : \omega_f(x) \ge 1/\iota(n+1) \,\}$.

**Claim 1 is stated separately because it is what is cited downstream.** The
exhaustion of $D$ by the superlevel sets $\{\omega_f \ge 1/\iota(n+1)\}$ is used
directly wherever a property has to be established one threshold at a time —
[[thm-baire-one-continuity-points]] shows each superlevel set nowhere dense and
concludes that $D$ is meager — and that use needs the identity itself, not only
the descriptive conclusion of claim 2.

**The statement is relative on purpose.** For a general domain $A$ the sets $D$
and $C$ are subsets of $A$, and neither is $F_\sigma$ or $G_\delta$ in
$\mathbb{R}$ in general; what the proof produces are two subsets of $\mathbb{R}$
that cut down to them. The absolute form is stated only for $A = \mathbb{R}$,
which is the case [[thm-continuity-set-realisation]] and
[[cor-no-function-is-continuous-exactly-on-q]] use.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$.

[L1] $f$ is continuous at $c \in A$ if and only if $\omega_f(c) = 0$; and $\omega_f(c) \ge 0$ for every $c \in A$ ([[thm-continuity-iff-oscillation-zero]], [[def-oscillation]], [[def-extended-reals]]).

[L2] For every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a closed $G \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ with $\{x \in A : \omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon\} = A \cap G$ ([[lem-oscillation-superlevel-sets-are-closed]]).

[L3] For every real $\eta > 0$ there is a natural $m \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(m) < \eta$, where $\iota(m)$ is the canonical natural of $m$ in $\mathbb{R}$; and $\iota$ is strictly increasing and positive on the naturals $\ge 1$ ([[cor-archimedean-reciprocal]], [[def-canonical-natural]], [[lem-of-naturals-positive]]).

[L4] A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is $F_\sigma$ when it is the union of a sequence of closed sets and $G_\delta$ when it is the intersection of a sequence of open sets; $S$ is $F_\sigma$ if and only if $\mathbb{R} \setminus S$ is $G_\delta$ ([[def-f-sigma-g-delta]], [[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ put $\varepsilon_n := 1/\iota(n+1)$, a positive real since $n + 1 \ge 1$, and let $G_n \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be closed with $\{x \in A : \omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon_n\} = A \cap G_n$. [L2, L3, construct]

1.2 $D = \{\, x \in A : \omega_f(x) > 0 \,\}$: a point $x \in A$ is a discontinuity exactly when $\omega_f(x) \ne 0$, and $\omega_f(x) \ge 0$ always, so exactly when $\omega_f(x) > 0$. [L1]

2.1 $D \subseteq \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} (A \cap G_n)$. Let $x \in D$, so $\omega_f(x) > 0$. If $\omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon_0 = 1$ then $x \in A \cap G_0$. Otherwise $0 < \omega_f(x) < 1$, so $\omega_f(x)$ is a positive real, and there is a natural $m \ge 1$ with $1/\iota(m) < \omega_f(x)$; writing $m = n + 1$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}$ gives $\omega_f(x) > \varepsilon_n$, hence $x \in A \cap G_n$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L3]

2.2 Conversely $\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} (A \cap G_n) \subseteq D$: if $x \in A \cap G_n$ then $\omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon_n > 0$, so $x \in D$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, L3]

3.1 Put $F := \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} G_n$, an $F_\sigma$ subset of $\mathbb{R}$ since each $G_n$ is closed and the family is indexed by $\mathbb{N}$. Then $A \cap F = \bigcup_{n} (A \cap G_n) = D$. [step 1.1, step 2.1, step 2.2, L4]

3.2 Claim 1 is proved: $D = \{x \in A : \omega_f(x) > 0\}$ by step 1.2, and $D = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \{x \in A : \omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon_n\}$ by steps 2.1 and 2.2, since $A \cap G_n$ is by step 1.1 exactly the set $\{x \in A : \omega_f(x) \ge \varepsilon_n\}$ with $\varepsilon_n = 1/\iota(n+1)$. The union is increasing, since $n \le m$ gives $\iota(n+1) \le \iota(m+1)$ and hence $\varepsilon_m \le \varepsilon_n$. [step 1.1, step 1.2, step 2.1, step 2.2, L3]

4.1 Put $V := \mathbb{R} \setminus F$, a $G_\delta$ subset of $\mathbb{R}$. Then $A \cap V = A \setminus (A \cap F) = A \setminus D = C$. [step 3.1, L4]

5.1 Claim 2 is proved by steps 3.1 and 4.1; and for $A = \mathbb{R}$ the two identities read $D = F$ and $C = V$, so $D$ is $F_\sigma$ and $C$ is $G_\delta$ outright. [step 3.1, step 3.2, step 4.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **The exhaustion is indexed from $0$ and the thresholds are $1/\iota(n+1)$.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$, so the sequence of thresholds is $1, 1/2, 1/3, \dots$ and never $1/\iota(0)$, which is not defined. Writing the union as $\bigcup_{n \ge 1} \{\omega_f \ge 1/\iota(n)\}$ names the same family; the form above is used because a sequence in this library is a function on $\mathbb{N}$.

- **The converse holds and is proved separately.** Every $G_\delta$ subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is the continuity set of some function $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-continuity-set-realisation]]), so the two classes coincide exactly. What the present theorem contributes is the direction that constrains: no function can have a continuity set that fails to be $G_\delta$, and [[cor-no-function-is-continuous-exactly-on-q]] spends that on $\mathbb{Q}$.

## Statement

Let open and closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ be as in
[[def-open-and-closed-in-r]].

1. **Arbitrary unions of open sets are open.** If $\mathcal{U}$ is any family of
   open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, then $\bigcup \mathcal{U}$ is open.
2. **Finite intersections of open sets are open.** If $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
   $U_0, \dots, U_n$ are open, then $U_0 \cap \dots \cap U_n$ is open.
3. **Arbitrary intersections of closed sets are closed.** If $\mathcal{F}$ is a
   nonempty family of closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, then
   $\bigcap \mathcal{F}$ is closed.
4. **Finite unions of closed sets are closed.** If $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
   $F_0, \dots, F_n$ are closed, then $F_0 \cup \dots \cup F_n$ is closed.

The word *finite* in claims 2 and 4 is not decoration: an arbitrary
intersection of open sets need not be open, and dually an arbitrary union
of closed sets need not be closed; the remarks below say where that is settled.
Claim 3 asks $\mathcal{F}$ to be nonempty
only so that $\bigcap \mathcal{F}$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ without appeal to
a convention about the empty intersection.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A family $\mathcal{U}$ of open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, with $\bigcup \mathcal{U} = \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \in U \text{ for some } U \in \mathcal{U} \,\}$; a natural number $n$ and open sets $U_0, \dots, U_n$; a nonempty family $\mathcal{F}$ of closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, with $\bigcap \mathcal{F} = \{\, x \in \mathbb{R} : x \in F \text{ for every } F \in \mathcal{F} \,\}$; and closed sets $F_0, \dots, F_n$.

[A1] De Morgan's laws in the ambient set theory: for a nonempty family $\mathcal{G}$ of subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{R} \setminus \bigcap \mathcal{G} = \bigcup \{\, \mathbb{R} \setminus G : G \in \mathcal{G} \,\}$, and $\mathbb{R} \setminus (G_0 \cup \dots \cup G_n) = (\mathbb{R} \setminus G_0) \cap \dots \cap (\mathbb{R} \setminus G_n)$. Also $\mathbb{R} \setminus (\mathbb{R} \setminus G) = G$.

[L1] $U$ is open when every $x \in U$ admits a real $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$; $F$ is closed when $\mathbb{R} \setminus F$ is open ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]).

[L2] $N_\varepsilon(x) = \{\, y : |y - x| < \varepsilon \,\}$, and $0 < \delta \le \varepsilon$ gives $N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x)$ ([[def-neighbourhood-r]]).

[L3] Every nonempty finite set of reals has a minimum, so $\min\{\varepsilon, \eta\}$ is defined and equals one of the two entries, and is $\le$ both ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Let $x \in \bigcup \mathcal{U}$. Then $x \in U$ for some $U \in \mathcal{U}$, and $U$ is open, so there is $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{U}$; as $x$ was arbitrary, $\bigcup \mathcal{U}$ is open, which is claim 1. [given, L1, choose]

1.2 Now let $U$ and $V$ be open and let $x \in U \cap V$; fix $\varepsilon > 0$ with $N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$ and $\eta > 0$ with $N_\eta(x) \subseteq V$. [given, L1, choose]

2.1 Put $\delta := \min\{\varepsilon, \eta\}$, which is one of $\varepsilon, \eta$ and hence $> 0$, and satisfies $\delta \le \varepsilon$ and $\delta \le \eta$; then $N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$ and $N_\delta(x) \subseteq N_\eta(x) \subseteq V$, so $N_\delta(x) \subseteq U \cap V$, and as $x$ was arbitrary $U \cap V$ is open. [step 1.2, L2, L3]

2.2 The family $\{\, \mathbb{R} \setminus F : F \in \mathcal{F} \,\}$ consists of open sets by [L1], so its union is open by step 1.1; that union is $\mathbb{R} \setminus \bigcap \mathcal{F}$ by [A1], so $\bigcap \mathcal{F}$ is closed, which is claim 3. [step 1.1, A1, L1]

3.1 Claim 2 now follows by induction on $n$: for $n = 0$ the intersection is $U_0$, which is open by hypothesis; and if $W := U_0 \cap \dots \cap U_n$ is open then $U_0 \cap \dots \cap U_{n+1} = W \cap U_{n+1}$ is an intersection of two open sets, hence open by step 2.1. [step 2.1, given]

4.1 Each $\mathbb{R} \setminus F_i$ is open by [L1], so $(\mathbb{R} \setminus F_0) \cap \dots \cap (\mathbb{R} \setminus F_n)$ is open by step 3.1; that set is $\mathbb{R} \setminus (F_0 \cup \dots \cup F_n)$ by [A1], so $F_0 \cup \dots \cup F_n$ is closed, which is claim 4. [step 3.1, A1, L1]

5.1 Claims 1, 2, 3 and 4 are steps 1.1, 3.1, 2.2 and 4.1 respectively, so arbitrary unions and finite intersections of open sets are open, and arbitrary intersections and finite unions of closed sets are closed. [step 1.1, step 2.2, step 3.1, step 4.1] ∎

## Remarks

- **Completeness plays no part.** Nothing above uses the least-upper-bound
  property, or even the Archimedean property: the only facts about $\mathbb{R}$
  the proof touches are the definition of a neighbourhood, its monotonicity in
  the radius, and the comparison of two positive radii. What needs completeness
  is not the algebra of open sets but the theorems about compactness that come
  later.

- **Why finiteness cannot be dropped in claim 2.** The minimum taken in step 2.1
  is a minimum of finitely many positive radii, and it is positive precisely
  because it is one of them ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]]). An infinite family of
  positive radii has an infimum that may be $0$, and then no positive $\delta$
  survives. That is exactly what happens for the shrinking intervals of
  [[fs-arbitrary-intersection-of-open-is-open]], whose named witness is
  [[cex-intersection-of-shrinking-intervals-not-open]].

- **The four claims are a rewriting of two.** Claims 3 and 4 are claims 1 and 2
  read through complementation, and closedness is *defined* by complementation
  ([[def-open-and-closed-in-r]]), so no separate argument about closed sets is
  possible or needed.
