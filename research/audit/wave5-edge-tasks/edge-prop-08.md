# Citation-precision audit — do these citing items state their target correctly?

You are reading a **published legacy corpus** of this library. Below are one or
more TARGET items, each quoted as it actually stands on disk, followed by every
place in this audit wave that cites it.

**The one question for every citing line:** does the citing text state the
target's own proposition — same domain, same quantifiers, same hypotheses, same
direction, same strength — or does it state something the target does not
actually give? A fact that quietly drops a hypothesis, flips an implication,
promotes an implication to a biconditional, or widens a domain is a **FATAL**
defect of the incorrect-dependency-citation class. It is this library's single
most common confirmed defect, and it is only visible by reading the two texts
against each other, which is what this file lets you do.

Do NOT report: a concise but faithful shortening (that is the required house
style); a paraphrase that preserves content; wording you would have chosen
differently; missing URLs; prose style. A citing line reading as a shortened
but faithful version of the target is CORRECT and must not be flagged.

Where a citing line says a dependency is declared but never cited in the body,
say whether that looks like a stale declaration or a use that lost its citation
— that one is NONFATAL either way.

For every finding use the block format from the brief, and finish with the
`N fatal, M nonfatal` line. If every citation is faithful, say so plainly and
name the targets you checked.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `thm-rationals-countable`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/thm-rationals-countable.md` — theorem — $\\mathbb{Q}$ is countably infinite

#### Statement

$\mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{N}$ ([[def-equinumerous]]): the rationals are
countably infinite ([[def-countable]]).

**No choice principle is used.** The one place where a reader expects a choice,
"pick a representative $a/b$ of each rational", is exactly where
[[lem-rat-positive-denominator]] applies: every rational *has* a representative
with positive denominator, so the map $(a,b) \mapsto [(a,b)]$ defined on
$\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ is already **surjective** onto $\mathbb{Q}$,
and countability follows from a surjection without ever selecting a
representative. The same device handles $\mathbb{Z}$, which is a surjective image
of $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ by construction ([[def-integers]]).

- [L2] Order and arithmetic: $1 > 0$, so $2 = 1 + 1 > 0$; sums of positives are positive; adding a constant preserves the order; a positive has a positive inverse, and $0 < a < b$ gives $0 < 1/b < 1/a$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[lem-of-inverse-positive]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

- [L6] Order in $\mathbb{R}$: $0 < 1$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]), sums of positives are positive and adding a constant preserves the order ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]), so $1 - (-1) = 1 + 1 > 0$ and hence $-1 < 1$; in particular $1 \ne -1$.

### `lem-geometric-sequence-null` (published-backward, page monotone-sequences-and-cauchy-completeness)

Title: For $|r| < 1$ the sequence $r^k$ is null, and for $|r| > 1$ the sequence $|r|^k$ diverges to $+\\infty$

- [L1] Absolute value: $|x| \ge 0$; $|x| = 0$ exactly when $x = 0$; $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$; and $|x| = x$ when $x \ge 0$, so in particular $|1| = 1$ because $1 > 0$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]], [[def-abs-value]], [[cor-of-one-positive]]).

#### Statement

Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be ordinals ([[def-ordinal]]). Then:

**(a)** every element of $\alpha$ is an ordinal;

**(b)** $\alpha \notin \alpha$;

**(c)** $\alpha^{+} = \alpha \cup \{\alpha\}$ is an ordinal;

**(d)** if $A$ is a **nonempty** set of ordinals then $\bigcap A$ is an ordinal;

**(e)** if $A$ is any set of ordinals then $\bigcup A$ is an ordinal;

**(f)** $\alpha \subseteq \beta$ if and only if $\alpha \in \beta$ or
$\alpha = \beta$;

**(g)** any two ordinals are comparable under inclusion: $\alpha \subseteq \beta$
or $\beta \subseteq \alpha$.

Everything here is a theorem of ZF and uses no choice principle.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `thm-product-universal-property`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/thm-product-universal-property.md` — theorem — A map into a product is continuous iff each of its components is; the projections are continuous and open; and each projection is surjective when every factor is nonempty, which for an infinite index set uses the Axiom of Choice

#### Statement

Let $(X_i, \mathcal{T}_i)_{i \in I}$ be topological spaces and let
$P := \prod_{i \in I} X_i$ carry the product topology, with projections $\pi_j$
([[def-product-topology]]). Then:

1. **The projections are continuous**, and the product topology is the coarsest
   topology on $P$ making all of them continuous.
2. **Characteristic property.** For every space $Z$ and every function
   $h : Z \to P$,
   $$h \text{ is continuous } \iff \pi_i \circ h \text{ is continuous for every } i \in I .$$
   The functions $\pi_i \circ h$ are the **components** of $h$, and every family
   of functions $h_i : Z \to X_i$ arises from exactly one $h$, namely
   $h(z)(i) := h_i(z)$.
3. **The projections are open maps** ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]), for
   the product topology and for the box topology alike. They need not be closed;
   that failure is recorded on this page as a false statement.
4. **Surjectivity.** If every $X_i$ is nonempty then every $\pi_j$ is surjective.
   For $I$ a natural number this is a theorem of ZF ([[lem-finite-choice]]); for
   an arbitrary $I$ it is the Axiom of Choice ([[def-axiom-of-choice]]), and this
   is the only place in the item where a choice principle is used.
