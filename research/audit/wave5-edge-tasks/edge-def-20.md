# Citation-precision audit — do these citing items state their target correctly?

You are reading a **published legacy corpus** of this library. Below are one or
more TARGET items, each quoted as it actually stands on disk, followed by every
place in this audit wave that cites it.

**The one question for every citing line:** does the citing text state the
target's own proposition — same domain, same quantifiers, same hypotheses, same
direction, same strength — or does it state something the target does not
actually give? A fact that quietly drops a hypothesis, flips an implication,
promotes an implication to a biconditional, or widens a domain is a **FATAL**
defect of the incorrect-dependency-citation class. It is this library's single
most common confirmed defect, and it is only visible by reading the two texts
against each other, which is what this file lets you do.

Do NOT report: a concise but faithful shortening (that is the required house
style); a paraphrase that preserves content; wording you would have chosen
differently; missing URLs; prose style. A citing line reading as a shortened
but faithful version of the target is CORRECT and must not be flagged.

Where a citing line says a dependency is declared but never cited in the body,
say whether that looks like a stale declaration or a use that lost its citation
— that one is NONFATAL either way.

For every finding use the block format from the brief, and finish with the
`N fatal, M nonfatal` line. If every citation is faithful, say so plainly and
name the targets you checked.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `def-linear-combination-and-span`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/def-linear-combination-and-span.md` — definition — Linear combination of a finite list, and the span $\\operatorname{span}(S)$ as the smallest linear subspace containing $S$

#### Definition

Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $F$ ([[def-vector-space]]).

### Finite sums of vectors

By axiom (V1) the triple $(V, +, 0_V)$ is an abelian group ([[def-group]]), hence
in particular a commutative monoid ([[def-semigroup-and-monoid]]). So the finite
products of [[def-monoid-finite-product]] are available in it, and we write them
**additively**: for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and a finite list $u : n \to V$, that is a
function on the von Neumann natural $n = \{0, \dots, n-1\}$
([[def-natural-numbers]], [[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]),

$$\sum_{i<n} u_i \;:=\; \prod_{i<n} u_i \quad \text{computed in } (V,+,0_V),$$

so that $\sum_{i<0} u_i = 0_V$ and $\sum_{i<\sigma(n)} u_i = \bigl(\sum_{i<n} u_i\bigr) + u_n$,
and the value depends only on $u_0, \dots, u_{n-1}$.

### Linear combinations

A **linear combination in $V$** is a vector of the form

$$\sum_{i<n} \lambda_i v_i$$

where $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $\lambda : n \to F$ is a finite list of scalars and
$v : n \to V$ is a finite list of vectors; the sum is the finite sum just
described, of the list $i \mapsto \lambda_i v_i$. For $S \subseteq V$, a vector
$w \in V$ is a **linear combination of elements of $S$** when there are
$n \in \mathbb{N}$, $\lambda : n \to F$ and $v : n \to S$ with
$w = \sum_{i<n} \lambda_i v_i$.

**The empty case is a real case.** $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
([[def-natural-numbers]]), and at $n = 0$ the sum is the empty sum, which is
$0_V$. So $0_V$ is a linear combination of elements of every subset of $V$,
including $S = \varnothing$. The lists are indexed from $0$, so a linear
combination of length $n$ is $\lambda_0 v_0 + \dots + \lambda_{n-1}v_{n-1}$; no
statement here is restricted to $n \ge 1$.

### The span

Let $S \subseteq V$. The set of linear subspaces of $V$ containing $S$ is
nonempty, since $V$ itself is one, so its intersection is a linear subspace of
$V$ by [[lem-intersection-of-linear-subspaces]]. That intersection is the **span
of $S$**,

$$\operatorname{span}(S) \;:=\; \bigcap \{\, W \;:\; W \text{ is a linear subspace of } V \text{ and } S \subseteq W \,\} .$$

It contains $S$, being an intersection of sets each of which contains $S$, and it
is contained in every linear subspace of $V$ that contains $S$. So it is the
**smallest** linear subspace of $V$ containing $S$, and those two properties
determine it uniquely: if $W$ and $W'$ both contain $S$ and are each contained in
every linear subspace containing $S$, then each is contained in the other. This
is what licenses the definite article.

A subset $S \subseteq V$ **spans** $V$, or is a **spanning set** of $V$, when
$\operatorname{span}(S) = V$.

Title: For $n\\ge2$, the punctured space $\\mathbb{R}^n\\setminus\\{0\\}$ is polygonally connected

- [L1] The standard unit vectors form a basis of $\mathbb R^n$, so a one-dimensional span is a proper subspace when $n\ge2$ ([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]], [[def-linear-combination-and-span]]).
- [L2] A vector outside $\operatorname{span}\{x\}$ cannot lie on a segment from $x$ to $0$, except at no point; the corresponding statement holds for $y$, by the vector-space axioms ([[def-linear-combination-and-span]], [[def-norm-and-normed-space]]).

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `def-vector-valued-functions-limits-and-continuity`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/def-vector-valued-functions-limits-and-continuity.md` — definition — Vector-valued functions $f : A \\to \\mathbb{R}^m$, their limits and continuity, with the dictionary to the metric notions

#### Definition

Throughout, $m \in \mathbb{N}$ with $m \ge 1$, and $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ carries the
Euclidean norm $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ of [[def-euclidean-inner-product]] and
[[def-p-norms-on-rn]], whose induced metric is the published $d_2$
([[lem-p-norms-are-norms-and-induce-the-published-metrics]],
[[lem-metrics-on-rn]]). A function into $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ is called
**vector-valued**.

### Continuity

Let $(X, d_X)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]), let $A \subseteq X$
carry the restricted metric $d_A$ ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]), let
$f : A \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$ and let $a \in A$. Then $f$ is **continuous at $a$**
when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ d_X(x,a) < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ \lVert f(x) - f(a)\rVert_2 < \varepsilon\ \bigr],$$

with $\varepsilon, \delta$ ranging over the positive reals, and **continuous on
$A$** when it is continuous at every point of $A$.

**This is not a new notion, and that is the point of writing it down.** Since
$\lVert f(x)-f(a)\rVert_2 = d_2\bigl(f(x),f(a)\bigr)$ and $d_A$ is the
restriction of $d_X$, the displayed condition is **verbatim** the condition of
[[def-metric-continuity]] for the map of metric spaces
$f : (A,d_A) \to (\mathbb{R}^{m}, d_2)$. So every theorem about continuous maps
of metric spaces applies to vector-valued functions with no translation, and
this library has exactly one notion of continuity here. The same move was made
once before, between the $\mathbb{R}$-native and the metric notions, in
[[lem-real-and-metric-notions-agree]]; this item is that move one dimension up in
the codomain.

The two cases used below are $X = \mathbb{R}$ with $d_{\mathbb{R}}(s,t) = |s-t|$
([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]) and $X = \mathbb{R}^{n}$ with $d_2$, for
$n \ge 1$.

### Limits, for a real domain

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$, let $c$ be a limit
point of $A$ ([[def-limit-point-r]]) and let $L \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$. We say
$f(x)$ **tends to $L$ as $x$ tends to $c$**, and write
$\lim_{x\to c} f(x) = L$, when

$$(\forall \varepsilon > 0)\ (\exists \delta > 0)\ (\forall x \in A)\ \bigl[\ 0 < |x - c| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ \lVert f(x) - L\rVert_2 < \varepsilon\ \bigr].$$

This is the condition of [[def-function-limit]] with the absolute value in the
codomain replaced by $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$; as there, the puncture $0 < |x-c|$ is
what makes $c$ a point the function need not be defined at, and the hypothesis
that $c$ is a limit point of $A$ is what stops the condition from being satisfied
vacuously.

**The notation denotes: at most one $L$ satisfies the condition.** Suppose $L$
and $L'$ both do and $L \ne L'$. Then $\varepsilon := \lVert L-L'\rVert_2 / 2 > 0$
by (N1) for $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]). Take $\delta$
and $\delta'$ for this $\varepsilon$ and put $\eta := \min\{\delta,\delta'\} > 0$.
Since $c$ is a limit point of $A$ there is $x \in A$ with $0 < |x-c| < \eta$
([[def-limit-point-r]]), and then

$$\lVert L - L'\rVert_2 \;\le\; \lVert L - f(x)\rVert_2 + \lVert f(x) - L'\rVert_2 \;<\; \varepsilon + \varepsilon \;=\; \lVert L-L'\rVert_2$$

by (N3) and (N2), which trichotomy forbids. So $L = L'$.

### Components

For $i < m$ define the $i$-th **coordinate projection**
$\pi_i : \mathbb{R}^{m} \to \mathbb{R}$ by $\pi_i(y) := y_i = y(i)$, and for
$f : A \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$ the $i$-th **component** $f_i := \pi_i \circ f$, a
real-valued function on $A$.

**Each $\pi_i$ is $1$-Lipschitz** ([[def-lipschitz-holder-contraction]]): for
$y, z \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$,

$$\bigl|\pi_i(y) - \pi_i(z)\bigr| \;=\; |y_i - z_i| \;\le\; \lVert y - z\rVert_2 \;=\; d_2(y,z),$$

the middle inequality being $|w_i| \le \lVert w\rVert_2$ at $w := y-z$
([[lem-every-norm-on-rn-is-continuous-for-the-euclidean-metric]] clause 3, or
directly because $w_i^{2}$ is one term of the sum $\sum_{k<m}w_k^{2}$). Written
in coordinates, $f(x)$ is the vector whose $i$-th coordinate is $f_i(x)$, and
$f(x) = \sum_{i<m} f_i(x)\,e_i$ in the standard basis
([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]]).

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps.md` — definition — Homeomorphism, open map, closed map, embedding, and what it means for a property to be topological

#### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be topological spaces and let
$f : X \to Y$ be a function. Continuity is as in [[def-continuous-map-top]],
injections, surjections and bijections as in
[[def-injection-surjection-bijection]].

- $f$ is an **open map** if $f[U]$ is open in $Y$ for every open $U \subseteq X$.
- $f$ is a **closed map** if $f[F]$ is closed in $Y$ for every closed
  $F \subseteq X$.
- $f$ is a **homeomorphism** if $f$ is a continuous bijection whose inverse
  $f^{-1} : Y \to X$ is also continuous. The spaces are **homeomorphic**, written
  $X \cong Y$, when a homeomorphism $X \to Y$ exists.
- $f$ is an **embedding** if $f$ is injective and the corestriction
  $f_0 : X \to f[X]$, $f_0(x) = f(x)$, is a homeomorphism onto $f[X]$ carrying
  the subspace topology inherited from $Y$ ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]).

**The inverse in the third clause exists because $f$ is a bijection**, and it is
the unique two-sided inverse ([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]); no choice
principle is involved. Continuity of $f^{-1}$ is a genuine additional demand: a
continuous bijection need not be a homeomorphism, and this page records that
failure as a false statement with a two-point witness.

**Open, closed and homeomorphism are three different conditions.** A
homeomorphism is continuous by definition, but an open map need not be continuous
and a closed map need not be continuous; and continuity implies neither openness
nor closedness. An open map need
not be closed and a closed map need not be open, and Sierpinski space
$S = \{a,b\}$ with open point $b$ ([[def-standard-topologies]]) witnesses both
failures at once: the constant map $S \to S$ with value $b$ is open, since the
image of every nonempty set is the open set $\{b\}$, and is not closed, since the
image of the closed set $\{a\}$ is $\{b\}$, whose complement $\{a\}$ is not open;
the constant map with value $a$ is closed and not open by the same computation
read the other way. What is true
is that for a **continuous bijection** the three notions collapse: it is a
homeomorphism exactly when it is open, exactly when it is closed. That is proved
in the next item and is not assumed here.

**Topological properties.** A **property of topological spaces** is a condition
$P$ that is either true or false of each space. $P$ is a **topological property**
(one is also said to be *preserved by homeomorphism*, or *invariant*) when
$X \cong Y$ implies that $P(X)$ and $P(Y)$ have the same truth value. Since
$\cong$ is an equivalence relation on spaces — the identity is a homeomorphism,
inverses and composites of homeomorphisms are homeomorphisms, all three verified
in the next item — a topological property is exactly one that is constant on each
$\cong$-class.

**What a homeomorphism transports.** If $h : X \to Y$ is a homeomorphism then
$U \mapsto h[U]$ is a bijection from $\mathcal{T}_X$ onto $\mathcal{T}_Y$, with
inverse $V \mapsto h^{-1}[V]$: both maps are well defined because $h$ and
$h^{-1}$ are continuous, and they are mutually inverse because $h$ is a
bijection. So a homeomorphism is an isomorphism of the structure "a set together
with a distinguished family of subsets", and every notion defined from the open
sets alone — closed, closure, interior, boundary, dense, convergence of
sequences, continuity of maps into and out of the space — is carried across by
it. Anything defined from extra data, such as a metric or an order, is not, and
that distinction is exactly what the phrase *topological property* is for.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `def-euclidean-inner-product`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/def-euclidean-inner-product.md` — definition — The Euclidean inner product $\\langle x,y\\rangle = \\sum_{k<n} x_k y_k$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$

#### Definition

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. A natural number is a von Neumann natural, that is a set,
and $n = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]],
[[lem-nat-order-is-membership]]), so

$$\mathbb{R}^{n} \;=\; \{\, x \;:\; x \text{ is a function } n \to \mathbb{R} \,\}$$

is the function space of [[def-function-space]] at $F = \mathbb{R}$ and $X = n$,
a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ under the pointwise operations
([[def-vector-space]]). We write $x_k := x(k)$ for $k < n$, and two elements of
$\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are equal exactly when they agree at every $k < n$. This is the
same set that [[lem-metrics-on-rn]] calls $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.

The **Euclidean inner product** of $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the real number

$$\langle x, y\rangle \;:=\; \sum_{k<n} x_k\,y_k ,$$

the finite sum of [[def-finite-sum]] applied to the list $k \mapsto x_k y_k$
(extended by $0$ beyond $n$, as every finite list in this library is). The
**Euclidean norm** of $x$ is

$$\lVert x\rVert_2 \;:=\; \sqrt{\langle x, x\rangle},$$

which is defined because $\langle x,x\rangle = \sum_{k<n} x_k^{2} \ge 0$ (a sum
of nonnegative terms, [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 4 and
[[lem-of-square-positive]], the case $x_k = 0$ giving $x_k^2 = 0$ by
[[def-integer-power]]) and every nonnegative real has a unique nonnegative square
root ([[thm-of-square-roots]]).

### Both are defined for every $n$, including $n = 0$

At $n = 0$ the set $\mathbb{R}^{0}$ has exactly one element, the empty function,
and it is the zero vector space ([[lem-standard-basis-of-f-n]] clause 5); the sum
above is the empty sum, so $\langle x,y\rangle = 0$ and $\lVert x\rVert_2 = 0$.
**This is the first place on this page where the two index regimes diverge, and
the divergence is deliberate.** The published metrics $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_\infty$ of
[[lem-metrics-on-rn]] are defined only for $n \ge 1$, because $d_\infty$ would
otherwise be a maximum over the empty index set; the algebra above needs no such
restriction. The boundary in this page runs between the algebra and the metric,
not where a reader would guess, and [[rem-rn-conventions-and-scope]] lists
exactly which items inherit $n \ge 1$.

### The algebra of the inner product

For all $x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$:

1. **Symmetry.** $\langle x,y\rangle = \langle y,x\rangle$, since $x_ky_k = y_kx_k$
   termwise.
2. **Additivity in the first argument.**
   $\langle x + y, z\rangle = \langle x,z\rangle + \langle y,z\rangle$: the list
   $k \mapsto (x_k+y_k)z_k$ is the termwise sum of $k \mapsto x_kz_k$ and
   $k \mapsto y_kz_k$, so [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 1 applies.
3. **Homogeneity in the first argument.**
   $\langle \lambda x, y\rangle = \lambda\langle x,y\rangle$, by
   [[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 2.
4. **Bilinearity.** Clauses 2 and 3 together with symmetry give the same two laws
   in the second argument.
5. **Positive definiteness.** $\langle x,x\rangle \ge 0$, and
   $\langle x,x\rangle = 0$ if and only if $x = 0$. Indeed a vanishing sum of
   nonnegative terms has every term $0$ ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]] clause 4), so
   $x_k^{2} = 0$ for every $k < n$, and a nonzero real has a positive square
   ([[lem-of-square-positive]]), whence $x_k = 0$ for every $k < n$ and $x = 0$.
6. **Agreement with the published Euclidean metric.** For $n \ge 1$ and
   $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$,
   $\lVert x - y\rVert_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{k<n}(x_k-y_k)^{2}} = d_2(x,y)$, the two
   sides being the same expression ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]]). In particular
   $\lVert x\rVert_2 = d_2(x, 0)$.

That $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ is a norm in the sense of [[def-norm-and-normed-space]]
is proved in [[thm-cauchy-schwarz-and-the-euclidean-norm]], where the triangle
inequality is obtained from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality; it is not assumed
here.
