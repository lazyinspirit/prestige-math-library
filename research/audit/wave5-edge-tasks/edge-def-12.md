# Citation-precision audit — do these citing items state their target correctly?

You are reading a **published legacy corpus** of this library. Below are one or
more TARGET items, each quoted as it actually stands on disk, followed by every
place in this audit wave that cites it.

**The one question for every citing line:** does the citing text state the
target's own proposition — same domain, same quantifiers, same hypotheses, same
direction, same strength — or does it state something the target does not
actually give? A fact that quietly drops a hypothesis, flips an implication,
promotes an implication to a biconditional, or widens a domain is a **FATAL**
defect of the incorrect-dependency-citation class. It is this library's single
most common confirmed defect, and it is only visible by reading the two texts
against each other, which is what this file lets you do.

Do NOT report: a concise but faithful shortening (that is the required house
style); a paraphrase that preserves content; wording you would have chosen
differently; missing URLs; prose style. A citing line reading as a shortened
but faithful version of the target is CORRECT and must not be flagged.

Where a citing line says a dependency is declared but never cited in the body,
say whether that looks like a stale declaration or a use that lost its citation
— that one is NONFATAL either way.

For every finding use the block format from the brief, and finish with the
`N fatal, M nonfatal` line. If every citation is faithful, say so plainly and
name the targets you checked.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `def-ordinal`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/def-ordinal.md` — definition — Ordinal (von Neumann)

#### Definition

A set $\alpha$ is an **ordinal** when both of the following hold.

1. $\alpha$ is a **transitive set**: every element of $\alpha$ is also a subset
   of $\alpha$, that is $x \in \alpha \Rightarrow x \subseteq \alpha$.
2. The membership relation restricted to $\alpha$, namely
   $\{(x, y) \in \alpha \times \alpha : x \in y\}$, is a **strict well-order**
   of $\alpha$ ([[def-well-order]]): it is irreflexive, transitive as a
   relation, trichotomous on $\alpha$, and every nonempty subset of $\alpha$ has
   an $\in$-least element.

Ordinals are written with lowercase Greek letters, and for ordinals we set

$$\alpha < \beta :\iff \alpha \in \beta, \qquad \alpha \le \beta :\iff (\alpha \in \beta \text{ or } \alpha = \beta).$$

Write $0 := \emptyset$, which is an ordinal because both clauses hold vacuously,
and write $\alpha^{+} := \alpha \cup \{\alpha\}$ for the **successor** of
$\alpha$.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `def-filter`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/def-filter.md` — definition — Filter on a set

#### Definition

Let $X$ be a set. A family $\mathcal{F} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ of subsets of
$X$ is a **filter on $X$** when it satisfies:

- **(F1)** *nontriviality*: $X \in \mathcal{F}$;
- **(F2)** *properness*: $\emptyset \notin \mathcal{F}$;
- **(F3)** *closure under pairwise intersection*: if $A, B \in \mathcal{F}$ then
  $A \cap B \in \mathcal{F}$;
- **(F4)** *upward closure in $X$*: if $A \in \mathcal{F}$ and
  $A \subseteq B \subseteq X$ then $B \in \mathcal{F}$.

The set of all filters on $X$ is written $\mathrm{Filt}(X)$. It is a subset of
$\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(X))$, hence a set, and it is ordered by inclusion:
$\mathcal{F} \subseteq \mathcal{G}$ is read "$\mathcal{G}$ is **finer** than
$\mathcal{F}$", and $\mathcal{F}$ is **coarser** than $\mathcal{G}$.

**Convention: filters are proper.** Condition (F2) is part of the definition
throughout this library, so "filter" always means "proper filter". The competing
convention drops (F2), calls the resulting objects filters, and says **proper
filter** for one that omits $\emptyset$. The two conventions differ by exactly one
object, since (F4) forces any family satisfying (F1), (F3) and (F4) that contains
$\emptyset$ to be all of $\mathcal{P}(X)$: if $\emptyset \in \mathcal{F}$ then
$\emptyset \subseteq B \subseteq X$ gives $B \in \mathcal{F}$ for every
$B \subseteq X$. That single extra object is the **improper filter**
$\mathcal{P}(X)$. This library follows the more widely adopted convention, in
which the improper filter is not a filter; a reader arriving from the other
convention should read every unqualified "filter" below as "proper filter".

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `def-hereditary-property`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/def-hereditary-property.md` — definition — Hereditary, open-hereditary and closed-hereditary properties of topological spaces

#### Definition

A **property of topological spaces** is a condition $P$ that is either true or
false of each space, as in [[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]; a **topological
property** is one whose truth value is the same for homeomorphic spaces. Every
subset of a space is regarded as a space by giving it the subspace topology
([[def-subspace-topology-top]]).

Let $P$ be a property of topological spaces. Then $P$ is

- **hereditary** if, whenever a space $X$ has $P$, every subspace of $X$ has $P$;
- **open-hereditary** if, whenever $X$ has $P$, every subspace $S \subseteq X$
  with $S$ open in $X$ has $P$;
- **closed-hereditary** if, whenever $X$ has $P$, every subspace $S \subseteq X$
  with $S$ closed in $X$ has $P$.

A hereditary property is both open-hereditary and closed-hereditary, since the
condition on $S$ is only a restriction of the range of subspaces quantified over.
Neither of the two weaker notions implies the other, and neither implies
heredity.

**The definition is stable under the route by which a subspace is reached.** If
$S \subseteq T \subseteq X$ then the topology $S$ inherits from the subspace $T$
is the topology $S$ inherits from $X$, transitivity being discharged in
[[def-subspace-topology-top]]. So "every subspace of $X$" is unambiguous, and a
hereditary property automatically passes from $X$ to a subspace of a subspace,
with no separate induction.

**Heredity is a statement about a property, not about a space.** It quantifies
over all spaces having $P$ and all their subspaces, so a single space whose
subspaces all inherit $P$ says nothing; and a single space that **has** $P$ and
has one subspace lacking $P$ refutes heredity outright. A space that lacks $P$
refutes nothing, however its subspaces behave. That asymmetry is why the failures are
recorded here as counterexamples and the successes as theorems.

**Only topological properties are worth asking about.** Taking $S = X$ shows that
a hereditary property holds of $X$ itself, and the subspace topology on $X$ is
$\mathcal{T}$ ([[def-subspace-topology-top]], with $U \cap X = U$), so the
definition is not vacuous at the top. But a condition that is not invariant under
homeomorphism can be hereditary for uninteresting reasons, since a subspace is
only determined up to the identification of its topology
([[def-topological-space]]); every property named hereditary in this library is
a topological property, and it is said so where it is proved.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `def-injection-surjection-bijection`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/def-injection-surjection-bijection.md` — definition — Injection, surjection, bijection

#### Definition

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets and let $f : A \to B$ be a function.

- $f$ is **injective** (one-to-one) if $f(x) = f(y)$ implies $x = y$, for all
  $x, y \in A$.
- $f$ is **surjective** (onto) if for every $b \in B$ there is some $x \in A$
  with $f(x) = b$; equivalently, the image $f[A] := \{ f(x) : x \in A \}$ equals
  $B$.
- $f$ is **bijective** if it is both injective and surjective.

For $S \subseteq A$ we write $f[S] = \{ f(x) : x \in S \}$ for the image of $S$,
and for $T \subseteq B$ we write $f^{-1}[T] = \{ x \in A : f(x) \in T \}$ for the
preimage of $T$.
