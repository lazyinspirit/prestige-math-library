# Citation-precision audit — do these citing items state their target correctly?

You are reading a **published legacy corpus** of this library. Below are one or
more TARGET items, each quoted as it actually stands on disk, followed by every
place in this audit wave that cites it.

**The one question for every citing line:** does the citing text state the
target's own proposition — same domain, same quantifiers, same hypotheses, same
direction, same strength — or does it state something the target does not
actually give? A fact that quietly drops a hypothesis, flips an implication,
promotes an implication to a biconditional, or widens a domain is a **FATAL**
defect of the incorrect-dependency-citation class. It is this library's single
most common confirmed defect, and it is only visible by reading the two texts
against each other, which is what this file lets you do.

Do NOT report: a concise but faithful shortening (that is the required house
style); a paraphrase that preserves content; wording you would have chosen
differently; missing URLs; prose style. A citing line reading as a shortened
but faithful version of the target is CORRECT and must not be flagged.

Where a citing line says a dependency is declared but never cited in the body,
say whether that looks like a stale declaration or a use that lost its citation
— that one is NONFATAL either way.

For every finding use the block format from the brief, and finish with the
`N fatal, M nonfatal` line. If every citation is faithful, say so plainly and
name the targets you checked.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `def-metric-ball`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/def-metric-ball.md` — definition — Open ball, closed ball and sphere in a metric space

#### Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]), let $x \in X$ and let
$r \in \mathbb{R}$ with $r > 0$ ([[def-real-order]]). Define

$$B(x,r) := \{\, y \in X : d(x,y) < r \,\}, \qquad \bar B(x,r) := \{\, y \in X : d(x,y) \le r \,\}, \qquad S(x,r) := \{\, y \in X : d(x,y) = r \,\}.$$

$B(x,r)$ is the **open ball**, $\bar B(x,r)$ the **closed ball** and $S(x,r)$ the
**sphere** of **centre** $x$ and **radius** $r$. The radius is always a strictly
positive real; a ball of radius $0$ or of negative radius is never written in
this library.

**Immediate consequences of the definitions.** For every $x \in X$ and $r > 0$:

- $x \in B(x,r)$, because $d(x,x) = 0 < r$ (axiom (M1) of [[def-metric-space]]);
  in particular open and closed balls are nonempty.
- $B(x,r) \subseteq \bar B(x,r)$ and $S(x,r) \subseteq \bar B(x,r)$, and
  $\bar B(x,r)$ is the disjoint union of $B(x,r)$ and $S(x,r)$, by trichotomy of
  the order of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]):
  each $y$ satisfies exactly one of $d(x,y) < r$, $d(x,y) = r$, $d(x,y) > r$.
- If $0 < s \le r$ then $B(x,s) \subseteq B(x,r)$ and
  $\bar B(x,s) \subseteq \bar B(x,r)$, by transitivity of the order.
- Nonnegativity of the metric ([[lem-metric-nonnegativity]]) is what forces the
  radius convention, and it forces it for the **open** ball only: if $r \le 0$
  then $B(x,r) = \{y : d(x,y) < r\}$ is empty, because $d(x,y) \ge 0 \ge r$
  for every $y$. The other two sets behave differently at $r = 0$, and the
  convention $r > 0$ excludes them for uniformity rather than for emptiness:
  $\bar B(x,0) = S(x,0) = \{x\}$, since $d(x,y) \le 0$ together with
  $d(x,y) \ge 0$ gives $d(x,y) = 0$ and hence $y = x$ by (M1). For $r < 0$ all
  three sets are empty.

**A sphere may be empty, and so the three sets are not on a par.** For $r > 0$
the open and closed balls always contain $x$, but nothing in the definition
produces a point at distance exactly $r$ from $x$. If a metric takes only the
values $0$ and $1$, as the discrete metric on the companion page does, then
$S(x,2) = \emptyset$ while $B(x,2) = \bar B(x,2)$ is the whole space. So
nonemptiness of a sphere is never available by convention: where it is used, it
is proved.

**The ambient space is part of the notation.** $B(x,r)$ depends on $(X,d)$ and
not on $x$ and $r$ alone. When more than one space or more than one metric is in
play we write $B_X(x,r)$, or $B_d(x,r)$, and likewise for $\bar B$ and $S$. This
matters as soon as subspaces appear ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]): a
ball of a subspace is the trace on it of a ball of the ambient space, and the two
are different sets.

- These are respectively the **Euclidean closed ball** and **Euclidean sphere** with centre $c$ and radius $r$. They carry the subspace topology inherited from $\mathbb{R}^n$ ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]).

- [L1] $I$ is a nonempty compact metric space: it is bounded, lying in $B(0,2)$, and closed in $\mathbb{R}$, so it is a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ ([[thm-heine-borel-rn]], claim 3, [[def-metric-compactness]], [[def-metric-topology]], [[def-metric-ball]], [[def-interval]]).

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `def-metric-space`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/def-metric-space.md` — definition — Metric space: $d(x,y) = 0$ iff $x = y$, symmetry, and the triangle inequality; pseudometric and ultrametric

#### Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]) constructed in this
library ([[def-real-numbers]]) and carrying its order ([[def-real-order]]).

Let $X$ be a set. A **metric** on $X$ is a function
$d : X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $x, y, z \in X$:

- **(M1) Separation.** $d(x,y) = 0$ if and only if $x = y$.
- **(M2) Symmetry.** $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$.
- **(M3) Triangle inequality.** $d(x,z) \le d(x,y) + d(y,z)$.

A **metric space** is a pair $(X,d)$ consisting of a set $X$ and a metric $d$ on
it. The elements of $X$ are its **points** and $d(x,y)$ is the **distance** from
$x$ to $y$. When only one metric is in play we write $X$ for $(X,d)$; when
several are, the metric is always named.

**The values of a metric are real numbers.** The codomain is $\mathbb{R}$, so
$d(x,y)$ is an honest element of the complete ordered field and every
inequality above is an inequality there. No infinite value is permitted;
[[rem-metric-axiom-conventions]] records why extended metrics are not treated in
this library.

**Nonnegativity is deliberately absent from the axiom list.** Many texts add a
fourth axiom $d(x,y) \ge 0$. It is redundant: (M1), (M2) and (M3) already force
it, as [[lem-metric-nonnegativity]] proves. Nothing below assumes it before that
lemma is available.

**Pseudometric.** A **pseudometric** on $X$ is a function
$p : X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying (M2), (M3) and the weakening

- **(M1') Reflexivity.** $p(x,x) = 0$ for every $x \in X$

of (M1). A pseudometric may therefore assign distance $0$ to two distinct
points. Every metric is a pseudometric, and a pseudometric is a metric exactly
when $p(x,y) = 0$ forces $x = y$.

**Ultrametric.** An **ultrametric** on $X$ is a metric $d$ that in addition
satisfies

- **(M3') Strong triangle inequality.** $d(x,z) \le \max\{d(x,y), d(y,z)\}$

for all $x, y, z \in X$, where the maximum is that of a two-element subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, which exists and is one of the two elements
([[def-max-min]], [[lem-finite-set-has-max]]). An **ultrametric space** is a pair
$(X,d)$ with $d$ an ultrametric.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `def-sequence`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/def-sequence.md` — definition — Sequences of reals: bounded, eventually, frequently, tails, subsequences

#### Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]],
[[def-real-numbers]]) with its order and absolute value ([[def-real-order]]), and
$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers with its order ([[def-natural-numbers]],
[[def-nat-order]]).

A **sequence of reals** is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$. We write
$x_k$ for the value $x(k)$, call it the **$k$-th term**, and write $(x_k)$, or
$(x_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$, for the function itself. The **range** of $(x_k)$ is
the subset $\{\, x_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals and let $P$ be a property of indices.

- $(x_k)$ is **bounded** if there is $M \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|x_k| \le M$ for
  every $k \in \mathbb{N}$; it is **unbounded** otherwise.
- $P$ holds **eventually** if there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $P(k)$ holds
  for every $k \ge K$.
- $P$ holds **frequently** if for every $K \in \mathbb{N}$ there is some
  $k \ge K$ for which $P(k)$ holds.
- For $K \in \mathbb{N}$, the **$K$-th tail** of $(x_k)$ is the sequence
  $x^{(K)}$ defined by $x^{(K)}_j := x_{j + K}$ for $j \in \mathbb{N}$; it is
  again a sequence of reals.
- A function $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is **strictly increasing** if
  $n_j < n_k$ whenever $j < k$. For such an $n$, the **subsequence** of $(x_k)$
  along $n$ is the composite $x \circ n$, written $(x_{n_k})_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$;
  it is again a sequence of reals.

**Convergence and Cauchyness are not defined here.** They are already fixed, for
sequences of reals, by the published [[def-real-limit]]: $(x_k)$ *converges* to
$x \in \mathbb{R}$ when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is
$K \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_k - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $k \ge K$, and $(x_k)$
is *Cauchy* when for every rational $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \in \mathbb{N}$
with $|x_k - x_l| < \varepsilon$ for all $k, l \ge K$. This page builds the
toolkit for those two notions and does not restate them. A sequence
**converges** if it converges to some real, and **diverges** if it does not.

`items/def-continuous-map-top.md` — definition — Continuity of a map of topological spaces at a point and globally

#### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be topological spaces
([[def-topological-space]]), let $f : X \to Y$ be a function and let $x \in X$.
Neighbourhoods are as in [[def-neighbourhood-top]].

$f$ is **continuous at $x$** if for every neighbourhood $V$ of $f(x)$ in $Y$ the
preimage $f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ in $X$.

$f$ is **continuous** if it is continuous at every point of $X$.

**The same condition with open sets only.** $f$ is continuous at $x$ if and only
if for every open $V \subseteq Y$ with $f(x) \in V$ there is an open
$U \subseteq X$ with $x \in U$ and $f[U] \subseteq V$. Indeed, if $f$ is
continuous at $x$ and $V$ is such an open set, then $V$ is a neighbourhood of
$f(x)$, so $f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ and contains an open $U \ni x$,
which satisfies $f[U] \subseteq V$. Conversely, given the displayed condition and
a neighbourhood $V$ of $f(x)$, fix open $V_0$ with $f(x) \in V_0 \subseteq V$ and
then open $U \ni x$ with $f[U] \subseteq V_0$; then $x \in U \subseteq f^{-1}[V_0] \subseteq f^{-1}[V]$,
so $f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$. Both forms are used below and are the
same statement written twice.

**Preimage, not image.** $f^{-1}[V] = \{\, x \in X : f(x) \in V \,\}$
is the preimage in the sense of [[def-injection-surjection-bijection]] and is
defined for every function, invertible or not; no inverse function is being
asserted to exist. Continuity is a condition on preimages throughout, and the
corresponding conditions on images define the *open* and *closed* maps of a later
item, which are different notions.
