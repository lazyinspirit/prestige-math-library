# Citation-precision audit — do these citing items state their target correctly?

You are reading a **published legacy corpus** of this library. Below are one or
more TARGET items, each quoted as it actually stands on disk, followed by every
place in this audit wave that cites it.

**The one question for every citing line:** does the citing text state the
target's own proposition — same domain, same quantifiers, same hypotheses, same
direction, same strength — or does it state something the target does not
actually give? A fact that quietly drops a hypothesis, flips an implication,
promotes an implication to a biconditional, or widens a domain is a **FATAL**
defect of the incorrect-dependency-citation class. It is this library's single
most common confirmed defect, and it is only visible by reading the two texts
against each other, which is what this file lets you do.

Do NOT report: a concise but faithful shortening (that is the required house
style); a paraphrase that preserves content; wording you would have chosen
differently; missing URLs; prose style. A citing line reading as a shortened
but faithful version of the target is CORRECT and must not be flagged.

Where a citing line says a dependency is declared but never cited in the body,
say whether that looks like a stale declaration or a use that lost its citation
— that one is NONFATAL either way.

For every finding use the block format from the brief, and finish with the
`N fatal, M nonfatal` line. If every citation is faithful, say so plainly and
name the targets you checked.

`items/def-topological-space.md` — definition — Topology on a set, open and closed sets, clopen sets, the closed-set axiomatisation, and the coarser/finer comparison

#### Definition

Let $X$ be a set and write $\mathcal{P}(X)$ for its power set. A **topology** on
$X$ is a family $\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ such that

- **(T1)** $\varnothing \in \mathcal{T}$ and $X \in \mathcal{T}$;
- **(T2)** $\bigcup \mathcal{S} \in \mathcal{T}$ for every $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$;
- **(T3)** $U \cap V \in \mathcal{T}$ for all $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$.

A **topological space** is a pair $(X, \mathcal{T})$ consisting of a set $X$ and
a topology $\mathcal{T}$ on it; the elements of $X$ are its **points**. When only
one topology is in play we write $X$ for the pair; when several are, the topology
is always named.

The members of $\mathcal{T}$ are the **open** sets of $(X,\mathcal{T})$. A subset
$F \subseteq X$ is **closed** when its complement $X \setminus F$ is open, and
**clopen** when it is both open and closed. By (T1) both $\varnothing$ and $X$
are clopen. *Open and closed are not opposites*: a set may be neither, and it may
be both, so "not open" is never a synonym for "closed".

**Finite intersections, and the empty one.** Axiom (T3) is stated for two sets
because that is all that is ever needed: if $n \ge 1$ and
$U_1, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{T}$, then $U_1 \cap \dots \cap U_n \in \mathcal{T}$
follows by iterating (T3) $n-1$ times. The intersection of the **empty** family
of subsets of $X$ is $X$, since the condition "lies in every member of the empty
family" is vacuous; that case is covered by (T1) rather than by (T3), which is
one of the two reasons $X \in \mathcal{T}$ is demanded outright. The other is
that (T2) alone gives only $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$.

**The closed sets, and the dual axiomatisation.** Put
$\mathcal{C} := \{\, X \setminus U : U \in \mathcal{T} \,\}$, the family of closed
sets. Then

- **(C1)** $\varnothing \in \mathcal{C}$ and $X \in \mathcal{C}$;
- **(C2)** $\bigcap \mathcal{D} \in \mathcal{C}$ for every **nonempty**
  $\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$;
- **(C3)** $C \cup D \in \mathcal{C}$ for all $C, D \in \mathcal{C}$.

Conversely, if a family $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ satisfies (C1),
(C2) and (C3), then $\mathcal{T} := \{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{C} \,\}$
is a topology on $X$ whose closed sets are exactly the members of $\mathcal{C}$.
So a topology may be presented equally well by its open sets or by its closed
sets, and this library uses whichever is shorter.

*Both directions are one computation, and it is carried out here rather than
assumed.* The map $U \mapsto X \setminus U$ is an involution of
$\mathcal{P}(X)$, hence a bijection, and it carries the two De Morgan identities

$$X \setminus \bigcup_{i \in I} A_i = \bigcap_{i \in I} (X \setminus A_i) \quad (I \ne \varnothing), \qquad X \setminus \bigcap_{i \in I} A_i = \bigcup_{i \in I} (X \setminus A_i) \quad (I \ne \varnothing)$$

term by term into each other. Given (T1)–(T3): $\varnothing = X \setminus X$ and
$X = X \setminus \varnothing$ lie in $\mathcal{C}$, which is (C1); for nonempty
$\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$ the family
$\mathcal{S} = \{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{D} \,\}$ lies in $\mathcal{T}$
and $\bigcap \mathcal{D} = X \setminus \bigcup \mathcal{S}$ is closed by (T2),
which is (C2); and $C \cup D = X \setminus ((X \setminus C) \cap (X \setminus D))$
is closed by (T3), which is (C3). Given (C1)–(C3) the same three lines run
backwards, the empty-union case $\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$ being supplied
by (C1) rather than by (C2); and $\{\, X \setminus C : C \in \mathcal{C} \,\}$ has
$\mathcal{C}$ as its family of complements because complementation is an
involution.

**Comparison of topologies.** If $\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ are
topologies on the same set $X$ and $\mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2$, then
$\mathcal{T}_1$ is **coarser** than $\mathcal{T}_2$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ is
**finer** than $\mathcal{T}_1$; the comparison is **strict** when the inclusion
is. Inclusion is a partial order on the set of topologies on $X$
([[def-partial-order]]), and it is not a total one: two topologies on the same
set may be incomparable.

`items/def-metrizable-space.md` — definition — Metrizable space: a topological space whose topology is induced by some metric; metrizability is topological, the metric is not

#### Definition

A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ ([[def-topological-space]]) is
**metrizable** if there is a metric $d$ on $X$ ([[def-metric-space]]) whose
metric topology is $\mathcal{T}$, that is $\mathcal{T} = \mathcal{T}_d$
([[def-metric-topology]]). Such a $d$ is said to **induce** or **metrise**
$\mathcal{T}$.

**The definition presupposes that $\mathcal{T}_d$ is a topology in the sense of
[[def-topological-space]], and it is.** By [[def-metric-topology]] both
$\varnothing$ and $X$ are open in $(X,d)$, which is (T1), and by
[[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]] the family $\mathcal{T}_d$ is closed under
arbitrary unions, which is (T2), and under intersections of $n \ge 1$ members,
which contains (T3). So every metric space is a topological space, and the
metric-space development of this library is a special case of the present one.

**The standard local notions in the two developments agree after translating
their neighbourhood conventions.** Let $d$ be a metric on $X$ and give $X$ the
topology $\mathcal{T}_d$.

- *Neighbourhoods and balls.* [[def-metric-topology]] uses "neighbourhood" for
  an open set containing $x$, whereas [[def-neighbourhood-top]] also allows a
  non-open superset of such a set. Thus the two collections are not literally
  equal, but the open metric neighbourhoods are cofinal in the broader
  neighbourhood filter. The balls $B(x,r)$, $r > 0$ ([[def-metric-ball]]), are
  open ([[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]]) and form a neighbourhood base at $x$:
  any neighbourhood $N$ contains an open $U \ni x$, hence a ball around $x$ by
  [[def-metric-topology]]. The balls of radius $1/n$ alone already suffice
  ([[lem-metric-ball-neighbourhood-base]]).
- *Interior, closure, boundary.* [[def-metric-interior-closure-boundary]] defines
  them by the same conditions with balls in place of neighbourhoods, and the
  previous bullet makes the two conditions equivalent; the metric closure is the
  smallest closed superset ([[thm-metric-closure-characterisation]]), which is the
  definition used here ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]). So the two
  closures, the two interiors and the two boundaries are the same three
  operations.
- *Convergence.* $x_k \to p$ in the sense of [[def-sequence-convergence-top]] is
  "eventually in every neighbourhood of $p$", and by the first bullet this is
  "eventually in every ball around $p$", which is [[def-metric-convergence]].
- *Continuity.* $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ continuity at $a$
  ([[def-metric-continuity]]) says that every ball around $f(a)$ has a ball
  around $a$ mapped into it, which by the first bullet is continuity at $a$ in
  the sense of [[def-continuous-map-top]].

- *Subspaces.* For $A \subseteq X$ the subspace topology
  $\{\, U \cap A : U \in \mathcal{T}_d \,\}$ of [[def-subspace-topology-top]] is
  exactly the metric topology of the subspace metric $d_A$
  ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]), so the two uses of the phrase
  *subspace topology* in this library name one thing. Indeed
  $B_A(a,r) = B_X(a,r) \cap A$: a trace $U \cap A$ is $d_A$-open, since each of
  its points $a$ has $B_X(a,r) \subseteq U$ and hence $B_A(a,r) \subseteq U \cap A$;
  and a $d_A$-open $W$ is the trace of
  $U := \bigcup \{\, B_X(a,r) : a \in W,\ r > 0,\ B_X(a,r) \cap A \subseteq W \,\}$,
  which is $d_X$-open, satisfies $U \cap A = W$, and involves no choice principle,
  the union being taken over a set of pairs rather than over a selection.

Consequently the metric-space notions of interior, closure, boundary, density,
convergence, continuity and subspace agree with the topological notions here,
and statements about them transfer once a metric is named. For neighbourhoods
the transfer uses the explicit convention change above: a metric-page
neighbourhood is an open topological neighbourhood, while every topological
neighbourhood contains one.

**Metrizability is a topological property; the metric is not part of it.** If
$h : X \to Y$ is a homeomorphism ([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]) and $d$
metrises $X$, then $d'(y_1,y_2) := d(h^{-1}(y_1), h^{-1}(y_2))$ is a metric on
$Y$ — the three axioms transfer along the bijection $h^{-1}$ — and
$h[B_d(x,r)] = B_{d'}(h(x), r)$, so $h$ carries a basis of $\mathcal{T}_d$ to a
basis of $\mathcal{T}_{d'}$ and $\mathcal{T}_{d'} = h[\mathcal{T}_d] = \mathcal{T}_Y$.
Hence $Y$ is metrizable. The metric itself, however, is **not** determined by the
topology: two metrics on one set may induce the same topology without agreeing,
which is exactly topological equivalence ([[def-equivalent-metrics]]), and
properties of a metric that are not properties of its topology, boundedness among
them, are therefore not properties of a metrizable space.

**Two things every metrizable space has.** It is **Hausdorff**: distinct points
have disjoint open neighbourhoods, by [[thm-metric-hausdorff-separation]] applied
to any metric inducing the topology. And it is **first countable**
([[def-first-countable-top]]), by [[lem-metric-ball-neighbourhood-base]]. Either
failure is therefore an obstruction to metrizability, and this page uses the
first of them to exhibit a topology induced by no metric.

**Sequential limits in a metrizable space are unique, so the notation
$\lim_k x_k$ is available there.** In a metric space a sequence has at most one
limit ([[lem-metric-limits-unique]]), and by the agreement of convergence above
that uniqueness is a statement about the topology alone; so within a metrizable
space, and only there, this page writes $\lim_k x_k$ in the ordinary way. In a
general space the symbol is unavailable ([[def-sequence-convergence-top]]).

**The usual topology of $\mathbb{R}$.** The absolute value makes $\mathbb{R}$ a
metric space under $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) = |x-y|$, its open balls are the bounded
open intervals, and the resulting metric topology is what claim 3 of
[[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]] names the **usual topology** of $\mathbb{R}$.
That is the topology meant by the phrase throughout these two pages, and
$\mathbb{R}$ carrying it is metrizable by definition. Every statement about it on
these two pages is proved from the metric $d_{\mathbb{R}}$ and the bridge above,
and no example re-derives any of it.

`items/def-metric-topology.md` — definition — The metric topology: a set is open when every one of its points has a ball around it inside the set; closed means open complement

#### Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]).

A subset $U \subseteq X$ is **open in $(X,d)$** if for every $x \in U$ there is a
real $r > 0$ with $B(x,r) \subseteq U$ ([[def-metric-ball]]). A subset
$F \subseteq X$ is **closed in $(X,d)$** if its complement $X \setminus F$ is
open.

The collection

$$\mathcal{T}_d := \{\, U \subseteq X : U \text{ is open in } (X,d) \,\}$$

of all open subsets is the **metric topology** of $d$ on $X$. A subset of $X$
that is both open and closed is called **clopen**.

**Two sets are open for trivial reasons.** $\emptyset$ is open, because the
defining condition quantifies over no points; and $X$ is open, because
$B(x,r) \subseteq X$ for every $x$ and every $r > 0$. Consequently $X$ and
$\emptyset$ are also closed, and both are clopen.

**A neighbourhood of a point $x$** is any open set containing $x$. The condition
above therefore reads: $U$ is open exactly when every point of $U$ has a ball
around it inside $U$, and it is the balls alone that have to be tested.

**The metric, not the set, determines $\mathcal{T}_d$.** Two metrics on the same
set may have different metric topologies, and two different metrics may have the
same one; the systematic comparison is [[def-equivalent-metrics]].

Title: The sequence $x_1 = 1$, $x_{k+1} = \\sqrt{2 + x_k}$ increases to $2$

- [L4] Order and arithmetic: $1 > 0$, so $2 = 1 + 1 > 0$ and $4 = 2 \cdot 2$; adding a constant preserves the order, and inequalities may be added ([[cor-of-one-positive]], [[lem-of-add-order]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

Title: The even and odd index maps and the alternating sequence: strictly increasing $e, o$ with $\\mathbb{N}$ their disjoint union, and the unique $(s_k)$ with $s_0 = 1$, $s_{\\sigma(k)} = -s_k$, which satisfies $|s_k| = 1$, $s \\circ e \\equiv 1$ and $s \\circ o \\equiv -1$

- [L6] Order in $\mathbb{R}$: $0 < 1$ ([[cor-of-one-positive]]), sums of positives are positive and adding a constant preserves the order ([[lem-of-add-order]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]), so $1 - (-1) = 1 + 1 > 0$ and hence $-1 < 1$; in particular $1 \ne -1$.

### `lem-cauchy-sequence-bounded` (published-backward, page monotone-sequences-and-cauchy-completeness)

Title: Every Cauchy sequence of reals is bounded

- [L4] Order arithmetic in $\mathbb{R}$: translation invariance, $a < b \Rightarrow a + c < b + c$ ([[lem-of-add-order]]); and the mixed transitivity $a \le b < c \Rightarrow a < c$, immediate from the reading of $a \le b$ as "$a < b$ or $a = b$" together with transitivity of $<$ ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

### `lem-peak-monotone-subsequence` (published-backward, page monotone-sequences-and-cauchy-completeness)

Title: Every real sequence has a monotone subsequence (the peak / rising-sun lemma)

- [L8] Trichotomy in $\mathbb{R}$: for reals $s, t$ exactly one of $s < t$, $s = t$, $s > t$ holds, so the failure of $x_m \le x_n$ is $x_m > x_n$, and $x_n > x_n$ is impossible ([[def-real-order]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]]).

- [L3] Order arithmetic: inequalities may be added and a constant added to both sides, in the strict form of [[lem-of-add-order]] and, with the case of equality settled by totality of the order, in the nonstrict form; and $a \le 0$ together with $a \ge 0$ gives $a = 0$ ([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-complete-ordered-field]]).

- [L2] Least-upper-bound property and uniqueness: a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ bounded above has a unique supremum; the supremum is an upper bound and is $\le$ every upper bound ([[def-complete-ordered-field]], [[lem-sup-unique]]).
