# Citation-precision audit — do these citing items state their target correctly?

You are reading a **published legacy corpus** of this library. Below are one or
more TARGET items, each quoted as it actually stands on disk, followed by every
place in this audit wave that cites it.

**The one question for every citing line:** does the citing text state the
target's own proposition — same domain, same quantifiers, same hypotheses, same
direction, same strength — or does it state something the target does not
actually give? A fact that quietly drops a hypothesis, flips an implication,
promotes an implication to a biconditional, or widens a domain is a **FATAL**
defect of the incorrect-dependency-citation class. It is this library's single
most common confirmed defect, and it is only visible by reading the two texts
against each other, which is what this file lets you do.

Do NOT report: a concise but faithful shortening (that is the required house
style); a paraphrase that preserves content; wording you would have chosen
differently; missing URLs; prose style. A citing line reading as a shortened
but faithful version of the target is CORRECT and must not be flagged.

Where a citing line says a dependency is declared but never cited in the body,
say whether that looks like a stale declaration or a use that lost its citation
— that one is NONFATAL either way.

For every finding use the block format from the brief, and finish with the
`N fatal, M nonfatal` line. If every citation is faithful, say so plainly and
name the targets you checked.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `lem-index-map-grows`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/lem-index-map-grows.md` — lemma — A strictly increasing index map satisfies $n_k \\ge k$

#### Statement

Let $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ be a function, written $k \mapsto n_k$, and
recall that $n$ is **strictly increasing** when $n_j < n_k$ whenever $j < k$
([[def-sequence]], [[def-nat-order]]).

1. **Consecutive comparisons suffice.** If $n_i < n_{\sigma(i)}$ for every
   $i \in \mathbb{N}$, then $n$ is strictly increasing.
2. **Growth.** If $n$ is strictly increasing then $n_k \ge k$ for every
   $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

Claim 1 is what one checks in practice when exhibiting a subsequence; claim 2 is
what every later subsequence argument uses.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `thm-of-square-roots`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/thm-of-square-roots.md` — theorem — Square roots exist: a unique $\\sqrt{a} \\ge 0$ with $(\\sqrt{a})^2 = a$; the positives are $\\{x^2 : x \\neq 0\\}$

#### Statement

Let $F$ be a complete ordered field ([[def-complete-ordered-field]]). Then every
$a \in F$ with $a \ge 0$ has a **unique** $s \in F$ with $s \ge 0$ and $s^2 = a$;
we write $s = \sqrt{a}$. Consequently the positive elements of $F$ are exactly the
nonzero squares: $x > 0$ if and only if $x = y^2$ for some $y \neq 0$.

### `cex-cauchy-rationals-no-rational-limit` (published-backward, page monotone-sequences-and-cauchy-completeness-examples)

Title: The truncated decimal approximations of $\\sqrt{2}$ form a Cauchy sequence of rationals with no rational limit

- **Given:** For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the rational $s_n = k_n/10^n$, where $k_n$ is the largest natural with $k_n^2 \le 2 \cdot 10^{2n}$, together with the properties established for it in [[fs-rationals-complete]]; and the real $\sqrt 2$ ([[thm-of-square-roots]]). Rationals are identified with their images in $\mathbb{R}$ under the embedding $q \mapsto \hat q$ ([[lem-rat-embeds-dense]]), so $(s_n)$ is also a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]).
- [L3] Square roots: $\sqrt 2 \ge 0$ is the unique nonnegative real with $(\sqrt 2)^2 = 2$ ([[thm-of-square-roots]], [[def-integer-power]]).

Title: The Babylonian sequence $x_1 = 2$, $x_{k+1} = (x_k + 2/x_k)/2$ decreases to $\\sqrt{2}$

- [L2] Square roots: every $a \ge 0$ has a unique $s \ge 0$ with $s^2 = a$; in particular $(\sqrt 2)^2 = 2$ ([[thm-of-square-roots]], [[def-integer-power]]).
