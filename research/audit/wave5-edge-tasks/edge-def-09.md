# Citation-precision audit — do these citing items state their target correctly?

You are reading a **published legacy corpus** of this library. Below are one or
more TARGET items, each quoted as it actually stands on disk, followed by every
place in this audit wave that cites it.

**The one question for every citing line:** does the citing text state the
target's own proposition — same domain, same quantifiers, same hypotheses, same
direction, same strength — or does it state something the target does not
actually give? A fact that quietly drops a hypothesis, flips an implication,
promotes an implication to a biconditional, or widens a domain is a **FATAL**
defect of the incorrect-dependency-citation class. It is this library's single
most common confirmed defect, and it is only visible by reading the two texts
against each other, which is what this file lets you do.

Do NOT report: a concise but faithful shortening (that is the required house
style); a paraphrase that preserves content; wording you would have chosen
differently; missing URLs; prose style. A citing line reading as a shortened
but faithful version of the target is CORRECT and must not be flagged.

Where a citing line says a dependency is declared but never cited in the body,
say whether that looks like a stale declaration or a use that lost its citation
— that one is NONFATAL either way.

For every finding use the block format from the brief, and finish with the
`N fatal, M nonfatal` line. If every citation is faithful, say so plainly and
name the targets you checked.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `def-lipschitz-holder-contraction`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/def-lipschitz-holder-contraction.md` — definition — Lipschitz map, $\\alpha$-Hölder map for rational $0 < \\alpha \\le 1$, and contraction

#### Definition

Let $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ be metric spaces ([[def-metric-space]]) and let
$f : X \to Y$ be a function. Recall that a metric takes nonnegative real values
([[lem-metric-nonnegativity]]).

- $f$ is **Lipschitz** with **constant** $L$, where $L \in \mathbb{R}$ and
  $L \ge 0$, if
  $$d_Y\big(f(x), f(x')\big) \;\le\; L \, d_X(x,x') \qquad \text{for all } x, x' \in X .$$
  $f$ is *Lipschitz* if it is Lipschitz with some such constant.
- Let $\alpha \in \mathbb{Q}$ with $0 < \alpha \le 1$ ([[def-rat-order]]). $f$ is
  **$\alpha$-Hölder** with **constant** $C$, where $C \in \mathbb{R}$ and
  $C \ge 0$, if
  $$d_Y\big(f(x), f(x')\big) \;\le\; C \, d_X(x,x')^{\alpha} \qquad \text{for all } x, x' \in X ,$$
  the power being the rational power of a nonnegative base
  ([[def-rational-power]]). $f$ is *$\alpha$-Hölder* if it is so with some such
  constant, and *Hölder* if it is $\alpha$-Hölder for some rational
  $\alpha \in (0,1]$.
- $f$ is a **contraction** with constant $q$ if it is Lipschitz with constant $q$
  and $0 \le q < 1$. The number $q$ is then called a **contraction constant** for
  $f$.

**The power $d_X(x,x')^{\alpha}$ is defined at every pair, including $x = x'$.**
The base $d_X(x,x')$ is a nonnegative real, and [[def-rational-power]] defines
$a^{\alpha}$ for every $a > 0$ and, by its supplementary clause, sets
$0^{\alpha} = 0$ for every rational $\alpha > 0$. Since $\alpha > 0$ is required
here, the displayed inequality at $x = x'$ reads $0 \le C \cdot 0$, which holds;
so no separate clause and no restriction to $x \ne x'$ is needed. Note that this
does not by itself explain the strict inequality $\alpha>0$: if one extended the
formula to $\alpha=0$ using the convention $0^0=1$ of [[def-integer-power]], the
equal-point inequality would still be the automatic $0\le C$. Globally, however,
that extension would reduce to the bounded-diameter condition
$d_Y(f(x),f(x'))\le C$, outside the standard Hölder range adopted here.

**Why the exponent is a rational and why it is at most $1$.** This library has no
real exponents ([[def-rational-power]]), so $\alpha$ ranges over the rationals;
that is a limitation of the ambient toolkit and not of the notion. The upper
bound $\alpha \le 1$ is the standard convention, and it is where the notion is
useful: the classical theory reserves the name for $\alpha \in (0,1]$, and
nothing in this library uses an exponent outside that range. No claim is made
here about what an exponent $\alpha > 1$ would do.

**Constants are not unique and are not part of the data.** If $f$ is Lipschitz
with constant $L$ it is Lipschitz with every constant $L' \ge L$, and likewise
for Hölder constants; the adjectives above are existential statements. A
*contraction*, by contrast, requires a constant strictly below $1$, and that is a
real restriction: exhibiting the constant is part of exhibiting a contraction, and
a map that shrinks every distance without admitting one uniform constant is not a
contraction here.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `def-integer-power`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/def-integer-power.md` — definition — Integer powers $a^m$

#### Definition

Let $a \in \mathbb{R}$, where $\mathbb{R}$ is the ambient ordered field
([[def-ordered-field]], [[def-field]]).

**Natural exponents.** By the recursion theorem ([[thm-recursion]]) applied to
the set $\mathbb{R}$, the starting element $1$ and the function
$f(x) = x \cdot a$, there is a unique function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$,
written $n \mapsto a^n$, with

$$a^0 = 1, \qquad a^{n+1} = a^n \cdot a \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}).$$

Thus $a^1 = a$, $a^2 = a \cdot a$, and so on. Note that this is defined for
**every** $a$, including $a = 0$.

**Negative exponents.** If $a \ne 0$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$, set

$$a^{-n} := (a^n)^{-1}.$$

**Why that is legitimate.** The right-hand side presupposes that $a^n$ is
invertible, that is, that $a^n \ne 0$. This is a proof obligation and not an
observation, and it is discharged by claim 2 of [[lem-power-laws]]: for $a \ne 0$
in a field, $a^n \ne 0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, proved there by induction on
$n$ from the fact that a field has no zero divisors ([[lem-of-no-zero-divisors]]).
That lemma is a statement *about* the operation introduced here, so it depends on
this definition and is recorded in this item's `justified_by` rather than in its
`deps` (SCHEMA §3). Given $a^n \ne 0$, the value $(a^n)^{-1}$ is a single
well-determined element, because multiplicative inverses in a field are unique
([[lem-of-inverse-unique]]).

**Integer exponents.** Every integer $m$ ([[def-integers]]) is either
$\iota(n)$ or $-\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$, where $\iota$ is the
embedding $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]],
[[def-int-operations]]). This too is a citation and not a slogan: the order on
$\mathbb{Z}$ is total ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]), so $m \ge 0$ or $m < 0$; the
image of $\iota$ is exactly the set of nonnegative integers, and each of them is
$\iota(n)$ for a unique natural $n$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]); and if $m < 0$ then
$-m > 0$, by compatibility of the order with addition ([[thm-int-ordered-ring]]),
so $-m = \iota(n)$ and $m = -\iota(n)$, with $n$ unique because $\iota$ is
injective. The two clauses above therefore define $a^m$ for every
$m \in \mathbb{Z}$ whenever $a \ne 0$, and for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$ for
arbitrary $a$. The clauses are consistent where they overlap: the only overlap is
$m = 0$, where $-\iota(0) = \iota(0)$ and $(a^0)^{-1} = 1^{-1} = 1 = a^0$.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `def-cardinal`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/def-cardinal.md` — definition — Cardinal (initial ordinal) and cardinality

#### Definition

Write $X \approx Y$, and say $X$ and $Y$ are **equinumerous**, when there is a
bijection $X \to Y$.

An ordinal $\kappa$ ([[def-ordinal]]) is a **cardinal**, equivalently an
**initial ordinal**, when

$$\text{no } \alpha \in \kappa \text{ satisfies } \alpha \approx \kappa,$$

that is, $\kappa$ is not equinumerous with any strictly smaller ordinal.

**Cardinality, under the Axiom of Choice.** Assume the Axiom of Choice
([[def-axiom-of-choice]]) and let $X$ be a set. Then $X$ carries a well-order
([[thm-well-ordering-theorem]]), which has an order type $\alpha$
([[thm-mostowski-collapse]]) and in particular $\alpha \approx X$. Now
$\alpha^{+} = \alpha \cup \{\alpha\}$ is an ordinal ([[lem-ordinal-basics]],
claim (c)) whose elements are ordinals (claim (a)) and which contains $\alpha$,
so $C = \{\xi \in \alpha^{+} : \xi \approx X\}$ is a nonempty set of ordinals and
has an $\in$-least element $\kappa$ ([[lem-ordinal-trichotomy]]). This $\kappa$ is the
**cardinality** of $X$, written $|X|$; it is a cardinal, because
$\beta \in \kappa$ with $\beta \approx \kappa \approx X$ would lie in
$\alpha^{+}$ and contradict the minimality of $\kappa$.

**Well-definedness: $\kappa$ does not depend on the well-order or on $\alpha$.**
The recipe above instantiates a well-order of $X$ and an order type $\alpha$ for
it, and $X$ will in general carry many well-orders with many different order
types, so the value $\kappa$ has to be shown independent of both. It is, because
$\kappa$ is in fact the least ordinal equinumerous with $X$ **outright**, a
description in which neither the well-order nor $\alpha$ appears. Let $\beta$ be
any ordinal with $\beta \approx X$. By trichotomy for ordinals
([[lem-ordinal-trichotomy]]) exactly one of $\beta \in \alpha^{+}$,
$\beta = \alpha^{+}$, $\alpha^{+} \in \beta$ holds. In the first case
$\beta \in C$, so $\kappa \subseteq \beta$ by minimality of $\kappa$. In the
other two cases claim (f) of [[lem-ordinal-basics]] gives
$\alpha^{+} \subseteq \beta$, and $\alpha \in \alpha^{+}$ because
$\alpha^{+} = \alpha \cup \{\alpha\}$, so $\alpha \in \beta$ and hence
$\alpha \subseteq \beta$ by claim (f) again; and $\alpha \in C$, so
$\kappa \subseteq \alpha$ by minimality, whence $\kappa \subseteq \beta$. In every case
$\kappa \subseteq \beta$, that is $\kappa \le \beta$. So $\kappa$ is the least
element of the collection of **all** ordinals equinumerous with $X$, and any two
runs of the recipe, from any two well-orders of $X$, return the same $\kappa$.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `def-norm-and-normed-space`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/def-norm-and-normed-space.md` — definition — A norm on a real vector space, the induced metric, and the dictionary with the metric axioms

#### Definition

Throughout this page $\mathbb{R}$ is the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) constructed in this library, in particular a
field, so that "vector space" below always means vector space over $\mathbb{R}$
([[def-vector-space]]).

Let $V$ be a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$, with zero vector $0_V$. A **norm on
$V$** is a function $N : V \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $u, v \in V$ and all
$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$:

- **(N1) Separation.** $N(v) = 0$ if and only if $v = 0_V$.
- **(N2) Absolute homogeneity.** $N(\lambda v) = |\lambda|\,N(v)$, the absolute
  value being that of [[def-abs-value]].
- **(N3) Triangle inequality.** $N(u + v) \le N(u) + N(v)$.

A **normed space** is a pair $(V, N)$ consisting of a vector space $V$ over
$\mathbb{R}$ and a norm $N$ on it. When only one norm is in play we write
$\lVert v\rVert$ for $N(v)$; when several are, the norm is always named.

**The values of a norm are real numbers.** The codomain is $\mathbb{R}$, so
$N(v)$ is an honest element of the complete ordered field and no infinite value
is permitted. This is the same convention [[rem-metric-axiom-conventions]]
records for metrics.

### Nonnegativity is a theorem, not an axiom

Many texts add a fourth condition $N(v) \ge 0$. It is redundant. Applying (N2)
with $\lambda = -1$ gives $N(-v) = |-1|\,N(v) = N(v)$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]],
[[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]] for $(-1)v = -v$), and then (N3)
with $u = v$ and $-v$ gives

$$0 \;=\; N(0_V) \;=\; N\bigl(v + (-v)\bigr) \;\le\; N(v) + N(-v) \;=\; N(v) + N(v),$$

where $N(0_V) = 0$ is (N1). So $N(v) + N(v) \ge 0$, and if $N(v) < 0$ then
$N(v) + N(v) < 0$ by addition of inequalities, which trichotomy forbids
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]). Hence $N(v) \ge 0$ for every $v \in V$.

**Consequently the verification of a candidate norm has three things to check and
not four**, exactly as the verification of a candidate metric has three and not
four ([[def-metric-space]], [[lem-metric-nonnegativity]]). No item in this
library assumes nonnegativity of a norm before the argument above.

### The induced metric

Let $N$ be a norm on $V$ and define

$$d_N(u,v) \;:=\; N(u - v) \qquad (u, v \in V),$$

where $u - v = u + (-v)$ ([[def-vector-space]]). **Then $d_N$ is a metric on
$V$** ([[def-metric-space]]), and the three axioms are the three conditions
above, in order:

- **(M1)** $d_N(u,v) = 0$ means $N(u-v) = 0$, which by (N1) says $u - v = 0_V$,
  that is $u = v$; and conversely $d_N(v,v) = N(0_V) = 0$.
- **(M2)** $d_N(v,u) = N(v-u) = N\bigl((-1)(u-v)\bigr) = |-1|\,N(u-v) = d_N(u,v)$,
  by (N2), [[lem-of-abs-value]] and $(-1)w = -w$
  ([[lem-vector-space-elementary-consequences]]).
- **(M3)** $d_N(u,w) = N\bigl((u-v) + (v-w)\bigr) \le N(u-v) + N(v-w) = d_N(u,v) + d_N(v,w)$,
  by (N3).

A normed space is therefore a metric space, and every notion defined for metric
spaces — open set ([[def-metric-topology]]), convergence, Cauchyness,
continuity, compactness — is available in it with no further definition. **This
library never introduces a second notion of any of them for normed spaces.**

### Two properties an arbitrary metric need not have

The metric $d_N$ satisfies, for all $u, v, w \in V$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$:

- **translation invariance**, $d_N(u + w, v + w) = N\bigl((u+w)-(v+w)\bigr) = N(u-v) = d_N(u,v)$;
- **absolute homogeneity**, $d_N(\lambda u, \lambda v) = N\bigl(\lambda(u-v)\bigr) = |\lambda|\,d_N(u,v)$, by (N2).

**Not every metric on a vector space arises from a norm**, and homogeneity is
what fails. The published bounded remetrisation [[lem-bounded-remetrisation]]
replaces a metric $d$ by $d' = \min\{d, 1\}$, a metric with the same topology
whose values never exceed $1$; on a vector space $V$ containing a vector $v$ with
$d(v, 0_V) > 0$ this $d'$ cannot be $d_M$ for any norm $M$, since absolute
homogeneity would force $d'(\lambda v, 0_V) = |\lambda|\,d'(v, 0_V)$, which is
unbounded in $\lambda$, while $d'$ is bounded by $1$. So the passage from norms
to metrics is not reversible, and a statement about a metric on a vector space is
strictly weaker than the corresponding statement about a norm.

Title: Every connected component of an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is open and polygonally connected

- [L1] A Euclidean ball is path-connected, hence connected: the norm triangle inequality keeps every straight segment in the ball, the segment is continuous, and every path-connected space is connected ([[def-metric-ball]], [[def-norm-and-normed-space]], [[lem-euclidean-polygonal-paths-are-continuous]], [[thm-path-connected-implies-connected]]).

Title: $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is polygonally connected, connected, locally path-connected and locally connected

- [L4] The norm triangle inequality keeps a segment joining two points of an open ball inside that ball ([[def-norm-and-normed-space]]).

Title: Euclidean spheres and closed balls as subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^n$

- Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$. Give $\mathbb{R}^n$ its Euclidean norm $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ and its induced Euclidean metric $d_2$ ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]], [[def-norm-and-normed-space]]). For $c \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $r>0$, put

### `ex-open-euclidean-ball-is-polygonally-connected` (published-backward, page the-topology-of-euclidean-space-examples)

Title: The straight segment between two points of an open Euclidean ball stays in the ball

- So the segment from $x$ to $y$ stays in the ball. By [[lem-euclidean-polygonal-paths-are-continuous]] it is a polygonal path, and $B_2(c,r)$ is polygonally connected in the sense of [[def-polygonal-path-and-polygonal-connectedness]]. The norm and ball conventions are those of [[def-norm-and-normed-space]] and [[def-metric-ball]].

Title: FALSE: every connected subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is polygonally connected

- [L3] If distinct unit vectors $u,v$ are joined by a segment, its midpoint has squared Euclidean norm $\lVert(u+v)/2\rVert_2^2=1-\lVert u-v\rVert_2^2/4<1$ ([[def-euclidean-inner-product]], [[def-norm-and-normed-space]]).

Title: For $n\\ge2$, the punctured space $\\mathbb{R}^n\\setminus\\{0\\}$ is polygonally connected

- [L2] A vector outside $\operatorname{span}\{x\}$ cannot lie on a segment from $x$ to $0$, except at no point; the corresponding statement holds for $y$, by the vector-space axioms ([[def-linear-combination-and-span]], [[def-norm-and-normed-space]]).
