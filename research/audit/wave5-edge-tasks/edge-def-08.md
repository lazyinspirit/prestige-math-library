# Citation-precision audit — do these citing items state their target correctly?

You are reading a **published legacy corpus** of this library. Below are one or
more TARGET items, each quoted as it actually stands on disk, followed by every
place in this audit wave that cites it.

**The one question for every citing line:** does the citing text state the
target's own proposition — same domain, same quantifiers, same hypotheses, same
direction, same strength — or does it state something the target does not
actually give? A fact that quietly drops a hypothesis, flips an implication,
promotes an implication to a biconditional, or widens a domain is a **FATAL**
defect of the incorrect-dependency-citation class. It is this library's single
most common confirmed defect, and it is only visible by reading the two texts
against each other, which is what this file lets you do.

Do NOT report: a concise but faithful shortening (that is the required house
style); a paraphrase that preserves content; wording you would have chosen
differently; missing URLs; prose style. A citing line reading as a shortened
but faithful version of the target is CORRECT and must not be flagged.

Where a citing line says a dependency is declared but never cited in the body,
say whether that looks like a stale declaration or a use that lost its citation
— that one is NONFATAL either way.

For every finding use the block format from the brief, and finish with the
`N fatal, M nonfatal` line. If every citation is faithful, say so plainly and
name the targets you checked.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `def-axiom-of-choice`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/def-axiom-of-choice.md` — definition — The Axiom of Choice

#### Definition

The **Axiom of Choice** (AC) is the following statement.

> Every family of nonempty sets has a choice function
> ([[def-choice-function]]).

Written out: for every set $\mathcal{F}$ all of whose members are nonempty,
there exists a function $g$ with domain $\mathcal{F}$ satisfying $g(S) \in S$ for
all $S \in \mathcal{F}$.

An equivalent formulation, immediate from the definition of the Cartesian
product, is that a product of nonempty sets is nonempty: if $X_i \ne \emptyset$
for every $i \in I$, then $\prod_{i \in I} X_i \ne \emptyset$.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `def-compactness-variants`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/def-compactness-variants.md` — definition — Countably compact, Lindel\\\"of, sequentially compact, limit point compact and $\\sigma$-compact spaces, and relatively compact subsets

#### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]), with
open covers, subcovers, finiteness and compactness as in [[def-compact-space]],
and *finite*, *at most countable* and *uncountable* as in [[def-countable]].

- $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is **countably compact** when every open cover of $X$ that
  is at most countable has a finite subcover.
- $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is **Lindel&ouml;f** when every open cover of $X$ has an at
  most countable subcover.
- $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is **sequentially compact** when every sequence $(x_k)$ in
  $X$, that is every function $x : \mathbb{N} \to X$
  ([[def-sequence-convergence-top]]), has a subsequence $(x_{n_j})$ converging to
  a point of $X$, the index map $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ being strictly
  increasing ([[def-sequence]], [[lem-index-map-grows]]).
- $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is **limit point compact** when every infinite subset
  $A \subseteq X$ has a limit point in $X$, that is a point $p \in X$ every
  neighbourhood $N$ of which satisfies $N \cap (A \setminus \{p\}) \ne \varnothing$
  ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]). Here *infinite* means not finite in
  the sense of [[def-countable]].
- $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is **$\sigma$-compact** when there is an at most countable
  family $\mathcal{K}$ of compact subsets of $X$ with $X = \bigcup \mathcal{K}$.
- A subset $A \subseteq X$ is **relatively compact in $X$** when its closure
  $\overline{A}$ ([[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]) is a compact subset of
  $X$.

A subset $A \subseteq X$ is called countably compact, Lindel&ouml;f,
sequentially compact, limit point compact or $\sigma$-compact when the subspace
$(A, \mathcal{T}_A)$ is ([[def-subspace-topology-top]]), exactly as for
compactness. **Relative compactness is the exception and is deliberately not of
that form**: it is a statement about $A$ *inside* $X$, since $\overline{A}$ is
computed in $X$, and a set may be relatively compact in one space and not in
another that contains it. Every other notion on this list is intrinsic to the
subspace.

**The countable covers may be listed.** A nonempty at most countable family
$\mathcal{U}$ admits a surjection $\mathbb{N} \to \mathcal{U}$
([[lem-countable-iff-surjection-from-n]]), so countable compactness says: for
every sequence $(U_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of open sets with
$X = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} U_n$ there are finitely many indices whose sets
already cover $X$. That surjection is produced from the countability assumption
alone and no choice principle is involved; the empty family covers only the empty
space, which is compact anyway.

**Indexing starts at $0$.** A sequence here is a function on $\mathbb{N}$ and
$\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$ ([[def-sequence]]), so a subsequence is
$(x_{n_j})_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ with $n_0 < n_1 < \cdots$ and $n_j \ge j$
([[lem-index-map-grows]]). An index range taken from a text that starts at $1$
must be shifted before it is used here.

**Agreement with the metric definitions.** Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space carrying
its metric topology $\mathcal{T}_d$ ([[def-metric-topology]],
[[def-metrizable-space]]). Then the three notions that
[[def-metric-compactness-variants]] defines metrically are the three defined
above, read in $(X, \mathcal{T}_d)$:

- *Countably compact.* The open sets used there are the members of
  $\mathcal{T}_d$, so the at most countable open covers are the same families and
  the condition is the same condition, exactly as for compactness itself
  ([[thm-compactness-agrees-with-metric-compactness]]).
- *Sequentially compact.* Convergence of a sequence in the metric sense and in
  the sense of [[def-sequence-convergence-top]] agree on a metric topology,
  because the balls around a point are a neighbourhood base at it
  ([[def-metrizable-space]]); the subsequences quantified over are the same.
- *Limit point compact.* A point $p$ is a limit point of $A$ in the metric sense
  when every ball around $p$ meets $A \setminus \{p\}$, and in the sense above
  when every neighbourhood does; the same neighbourhood base makes the two
  conditions one ([[def-metrizable-space]],
  [[def-interior-closure-boundary-top]]).

So no statement below about a metrizable space introduces a second notion, and
every theorem of the metric development about these three properties may be
quoted here once a metric inducing the topology is named. Lindel&ouml;fness,
$\sigma$-compactness and relative compactness have no metric counterpart in this
library and are defined here for the first time.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `def-sequence-convergence-top`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/def-sequence-convergence-top.md` — definition — Convergence and cluster points of a sequence in a topological space, sequential continuity, and the sequential closure

#### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]), with
neighbourhoods as in [[def-neighbourhood-top]].

A **sequence in $X$** is a function $x : \mathbb{N} \to X$, written $(x_k)$ with
$x_k := x(k)$. As everywhere in this library $\mathbb{N}$ contains $0$
([[def-natural-numbers]]) and a sequence is indexed from $0$
([[def-sequence]]); an index range copied from a text that starts at $1$ must be
shifted before it is used here. The **range** of $(x_k)$ is
$\{\, x_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \,\}$. Following [[def-sequence]], a property of
indices holds **eventually** if it holds for all $k \ge K$ for some
$K \in \mathbb{N}$, and **frequently** if for every $K$ it holds for some
$k \ge K$; that vocabulary is used here for sequences in an arbitrary set.

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence in $X$ and let $p \in X$.

- $(x_k)$ **converges to $p$**, written $x_k \to p$, if for every neighbourhood
  $N$ of $p$ one has $x_k \in N$ eventually. The point $p$ is then called **a
  limit of $(x_k)$**.
- $p$ is a **cluster point** of $(x_k)$ if for every neighbourhood $N$ of $p$ one
  has $x_k \in N$ frequently.
- For $A \subseteq X$, the **sequential closure** of $A$ is
  $$\operatorname{seqcl}(A) := \{\, p \in X : x_k \to p \text{ for some sequence } (x_k) \text{ with } x_k \in A \text{ for all } k \,\} .$$
- A function $f : X \to Y$ into a topological space $Y$ is **sequentially
  continuous at $p$** if $x_k \to p$ in $X$ implies $f(x_k) \to f(p)$ in $Y$, and
  **sequentially continuous** if it is sequentially continuous at every point of
  $X$ ([[def-continuous-map-top]] for the ordinary notion).

**The notation $\lim_k x_k$ is not available at this generality, and the reason
is not fastidiousness.** In a general topological space a sequence may converge
to more than one point, so there is no function taking a convergent sequence to
"its" limit, and a symbol $\lim_k x_k$ would not denote. In the indiscrete
topology on a set with at least two points the only neighbourhood of any point is
$X$, so **every** sequence converges to **every** point; in the cofinite topology
on an infinite set every injective sequence converges to every point. Both
witnesses are on the companion page. Accordingly this library writes "$p$ is *a*
limit of $(x_k)$" and "$(x_k)$ converges to $p$", never "*the* limit" and never
$\lim_k x_k$, for a sequence in a space that has not been given a hypothesis
restoring uniqueness.

**Where the notation becomes legitimate again.** Uniqueness of limits is what
licenses the symbol, exactly as it does for sequences of reals
([[lem-limit-unique]]) and in a metric space ([[lem-metric-limits-unique]]): in a
metric space a sequence has at most one limit and $\lim_k x_k$ is unambiguous.
Every metrizable space therefore admits the notation, and so does every space in
which distinct points have disjoint neighbourhoods; where this page uses a
metrizable space, and only there, the usual notation is used without further
comment. The general reading of "$x_k \to p$" above never presupposes it.

**Convergence agrees with the metric notion on a metric topology.** For a metric
space the balls around $p$ are a neighbourhood base at $p$
([[lem-metric-ball-neighbourhood-base]]), so "eventually in every neighbourhood
of $p$" and "eventually in every ball around $p$" are the same condition, and the
latter is [[def-metric-convergence]]. The identification is carried out where
metrizable spaces are defined, later on this page.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `def-first-countable-top`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/def-first-countable-top.md` — definition — First countable space: a countable neighbourhood base at every point

#### Definition

A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ ([[def-topological-space]]) is **first
countable** if every point of $X$ has an at most countable neighbourhood base:
for each $x \in X$ there is a family
$\mathcal{B}_x \subseteq \mathcal{N}(x)$ that is at most countable
([[def-countable]], [[def-equinumerous]]) and such that every neighbourhood of
$x$ contains a member of $\mathcal{B}_x$ ([[def-neighbourhood-top]]).

**"Countable" here means "at most countable"**, as everywhere in this library
([[def-countable]]), so a *finite* neighbourhood base is permitted. That is not a
degenerate case: in a discrete space the one-element family $\{\{x\}\}$ is a
neighbourhood base at $x$, so every discrete space is first countable, and in an
indiscrete space $\{X\}$ is a neighbourhood base at every point.

**The base may be taken to consist of open sets, and it may be taken
decreasing.** If $\mathcal{B}_x$ is an at most countable neighbourhood base at
$x$, then replacing each $N \in \mathcal{B}_x$ by an open $U_N$ with
$x \in U_N \subseteq N$ gives an at most countable neighbourhood base of open
sets. Making the base decreasing, that is arranging
$M_0 \supseteq M_1 \supseteq \dots$, requires enumerating it and forming the
running finite intersections; both operations are carried out inside the proof of
the theorem that uses them, the next item, where the enumeration and the
recursion are cited explicitly rather than assumed here.

**First countability is a topological property**
([[def-homeomorphism-and-open-maps]]): a homeomorphism $h : X \to Y$ carries a
neighbourhood base at $x$ to a neighbourhood base at $h(x)$, since
$N \mapsto h[N]$ is a bijection between the neighbourhood filters preserving
inclusion, and a bijection preserves at most countability
([[def-equinumerous]]).

### `fs-first-countable-spaces-are-second-countable` (published-backward, page countability-axioms-and-cardinal-functions)

Title: Refuted: every first countable space is second countable

- [L2] A space is first countable when every point has an at most countable local base, and second countable when it has an at most countable global basis ([[def-first-countable-top]], [[def-second-countable-space]]).

### `fs-the-compact-open-topology-is-always-metrizable` (published-backward, page function-space-topologies)

Title: FALSE: the compact-open topology on $C(X,Y)$ is metrizable for every metric $X$ and $Y$

- [L5] A metrizable space is first countable ([[def-metrizable-space]], [[def-first-countable-top]]).

### `lem-countable-local-bases-can-be-open-and-decreasing` (published-backward, page countability-axioms-and-cardinal-functions)

Title: A countable local base can be chosen open and decreasing

- **Given:** A countable local base at $x$ ([[def-first-countable-top]]).

### `thm-countable-products-of-first-countable-spaces` (published-backward, page countability-axioms-and-cardinal-functions)

Title: Assuming countable choice, a countable product of first countable spaces is first countable

- [F1] Basic neighbourhoods in the product topology restrict only finitely many coordinates ([[def-product-topology]], [[def-first-countable-top]]).

### `thm-second-countable-implies-first-countable` (published-backward, page countability-axioms-and-cardinal-functions)
