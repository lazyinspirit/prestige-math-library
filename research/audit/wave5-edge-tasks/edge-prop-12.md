# Citation-precision audit — do these citing items state their target correctly?

You are reading a **published legacy corpus** of this library. Below are one or
more TARGET items, each quoted as it actually stands on disk, followed by every
place in this audit wave that cites it.

**The one question for every citing line:** does the citing text state the
target's own proposition — same domain, same quantifiers, same hypotheses, same
direction, same strength — or does it state something the target does not
actually give? A fact that quietly drops a hypothesis, flips an implication,
promotes an implication to a biconditional, or widens a domain is a **FATAL**
defect of the incorrect-dependency-citation class. It is this library's single
most common confirmed defect, and it is only visible by reading the two texts
against each other, which is what this file lets you do.

Do NOT report: a concise but faithful shortening (that is the required house
style); a paraphrase that preserves content; wording you would have chosen
differently; missing URLs; prose style. A citing line reading as a shortened
but faithful version of the target is CORRECT and must not be flagged.

Where a citing line says a dependency is declared but never cited in the body,
say whether that looks like a stale declaration or a use that lost its citation
— that one is NONFATAL either way.

For every finding use the block format from the brief, and finish with the
`N fatal, M nonfatal` line. If every citation is faithful, say so plainly and
name the targets you checked.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `lem-power-laws`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/lem-power-laws.md` — lemma — Laws of integer exponents

#### Statement

Let $a, b$ be elements of a field ([[def-field]]) and let integer powers be as in
[[def-integer-power]].

1. For all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$: $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ and $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$.
2. If $a \ne 0$ then $a^n \ne 0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and $a^{-m} = (a^m)^{-1}$ for every $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ ([[def-int-operations]]).
3. If $a \ne 0$ and $b \ne 0$ then all three identities of claim 1 hold for all $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `lem-limit-of-tail`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/lem-limit-of-tail.md` — lemma — Convergence depends only on the tail

#### Statement

Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence of reals ([[def-sequence]]), let $x \in \mathbb{R}$,
and for $K \in \mathbb{N}$ let $x^{(K)}$ denote the $K$-th tail, $x^{(K)}_j =
x_{j+K}$. The following are equivalent ([[def-real-limit]]):

1. $(x_k)$ converges to $x$;
2. every tail $x^{(K)}$ converges to $x$;
3. some tail $x^{(K)}$ converges to $x$.

The same three statements with "converges to $x$" replaced by "is Cauchy" are
likewise equivalent. Consequently, if two sequences agree from some index on,
then either both converge to $x$ or neither does, and either both are Cauchy or
neither is.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `lem-metrics-on-rn`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/lem-metrics-on-rn.md` — lemma — $\\mathbb{R}^n$ as the set of functions $n \\to \\mathbb{R}$, and $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_\\infty$ are metrics on it

#### Statement

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$. A von Neumann natural is the set of its
predecessors, $n = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ ([[def-natural-numbers]]), so it can be
used directly as an index set. Define

$$\mathbb{R}^n := \{\, x : x \text{ is a function } n \to \mathbb{R} \,\},$$

and write $x_k$ for $x(k)$, $k < n$. Two elements of $\mathbb{R}^n$ are equal
exactly when they agree at every $k < n$, functions being equal when they have
the same values. For $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ put

$$d_1(x,y) := \sum_{k<n} |x_k - y_k|, \qquad d_2(x,y) := \sqrt{\ \sum_{k<n} (x_k - y_k)^2\ }, \qquad d_\infty(x,y) := \max\{\, |x_k - y_k| : k < n \,\}.$$

All three are well defined: the finite sums are those of [[def-finite-sum]]; the
sum of squares is nonnegative ([[lem-finite-sum-laws]], [[lem-of-square-positive]])
so it has a unique nonnegative square root ([[thm-of-square-roots]]); and
$\{|x_k - y_k| : k < n\}$ is a nonempty finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$, because
$n \ge 1$, so it has a maximum ([[lem-finite-set-has-max]], [[def-max-min]]).

**Then $d_1$, $d_2$ and $d_\infty$ are metrics on $\mathbb{R}^n$**
([[def-metric-space]]).

**Why $n \ge 1$.** For $n = 0$ the set $\mathbb{R}^0$ has exactly one element,
the empty function, and $d_1$ and $d_2$ are the empty sum $0$ and its root; but
$d_\infty$ would be the maximum of the empty set, which does not exist. The
hypothesis $n \ge 1$ is therefore not decoration, and it is carried by every
statement about $d_\infty$ in this library.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `thm-path-connected-implies-connected`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/thm-path-connected-implies-connected.md` — theorem — Every path-connected space is connected, and every path component lies inside a component

#### Statement

Let $X$ be a topological space, with subsets carrying the subspace topology
([[def-subspace-topology-top]]). Then:

1. **The unit interval is connected.** $I = [0,1]$ is a connected subset of
   $\mathbb{R}$, hence a connected space.
2. **Path-connected implies connected.** If $X$ is path-connected
   ([[def-path-connected]]) then $X$ is connected ([[def-connected-space]]). The
   same holds for a subset: a path-connected subset of $X$ is a connected subset
   of $X$.
3. **Path components refine components.** For every $x \in X$,
   $$P(x) \;\subseteq\; C(x),$$
   the path component inside the component
   ([[def-connected-component-and-quasicomponent]]). So every component is a
   union of path components.

**No converse is claimed.** Claim 2 is one-directional and claim 3 is an
inclusion; the question of when a connected space is path-connected is not
settled here.

**No choice principle is used.** The proof takes the union over the **set of all**
paths issuing from a fixed point rather than selecting one path per endpoint,
which is what an appeal to the Axiom of Choice would be. The point at which the
temptation arises is flagged in the remarks.
