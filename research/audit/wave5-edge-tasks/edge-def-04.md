# Citation-precision audit — do these citing items state their target correctly?

You are reading a **published legacy corpus** of this library. Below are one or
more TARGET items, each quoted as it actually stands on disk, followed by every
place in this audit wave that cites it.

**The one question for every citing line:** does the citing text state the
target's own proposition — same domain, same quantifiers, same hypotheses, same
direction, same strength — or does it state something the target does not
actually give? A fact that quietly drops a hypothesis, flips an implication,
promotes an implication to a biconditional, or widens a domain is a **FATAL**
defect of the incorrect-dependency-citation class. It is this library's single
most common confirmed defect, and it is only visible by reading the two texts
against each other, which is what this file lets you do.

Do NOT report: a concise but faithful shortening (that is the required house
style); a paraphrase that preserves content; wording you would have chosen
differently; missing URLs; prose style. A citing line reading as a shortened
but faithful version of the target is CORRECT and must not be flagged.

Where a citing line says a dependency is declared but never cited in the body,
say whether that looks like a stale declaration or a use that lost its citation
— that one is NONFATAL either way.

For every finding use the block format from the brief, and finish with the
`N fatal, M nonfatal` line. If every citation is faithful, say so plainly and
name the targets you checked.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `def-ordered-field`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/def-ordered-field.md` — definition — Ordered field

#### Definition

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ ([[def-field]]) together with a subset
$P \subseteq F$, the set of **positive** elements (the *positive cone*),
satisfying:

- **(O1) Trichotomy.** For each $x \in F$, exactly one of the following holds:
  $x \in P$, or $x = 0$, or $-x \in P$.
- **(O2) Closure.** If $x, y \in P$ then $x + y \in P$ and $x \cdot y \in P$.

We write $x > 0$ for $x \in P$ (read "$x$ is positive"), and define the order by

$$a < b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; b - a \in P, \qquad a \le b \;:\Longleftrightarrow\; a < b \text{ or } a = b.$$

Thus $a > b$ means $b < a$, and $a \ge b$ means $b \le a$. An element $x$ with
$-x \in P$ (equivalently $x < 0$) is called **negative**.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `def-neighbourhood-top`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/def-neighbourhood-top.md` — definition — Neighbourhood of a point and neighbourhood base, with this library's convention that a neighbourhood need not be open

#### Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space ([[def-topological-space]]) and let
$x \in X$.

A set $N \subseteq X$ is a **neighbourhood of $x$** if there is an open
$U \in \mathcal{T}$ with $x \in U \subseteq N$. The family of all neighbourhoods
of $x$ is written $\mathcal{N}(x)$ and called the **neighbourhood filter** at
$x$. A neighbourhood that is itself open is an **open neighbourhood**.

**Convention, and it is a live fork: in this library a neighbourhood need not be
open.** The competing convention, used by Munkres among others, defines a
neighbourhood of $x$ to be an *open* set containing $x$. Both are in current use;
this library follows the one above and writes "open neighbourhood" in full
whenever openness is wanted, so that no statement here depends on which
convention a reader brings.

A family $\mathcal{B}_x \subseteq \mathcal{N}(x)$ is a **neighbourhood base at
$x$** if every neighbourhood of $x$ contains a member of $\mathcal{B}_x$: for
every $N \in \mathcal{N}(x)$ there is $B \in \mathcal{B}_x$ with $B \subseteq N$.

**Four immediate consequences, established here because they are used
constantly.**

1. *$X$ is a neighbourhood of each of its points*, since $x \in X \subseteq X$
   and $X$ is open by (T1); so $\mathcal{N}(x) \ne \varnothing$ and every point
   has at least one neighbourhood base, namely $\mathcal{N}(x)$ itself.
2. *A superset of a neighbourhood of $x$ is a neighbourhood of $x$*: if
   $x \in U \subseteq N \subseteq M$ with $U$ open then $x \in U \subseteq M$.
3. *The intersection of two neighbourhoods of $x$ is a neighbourhood of $x$*: if
   $x \in U \subseteq N$ and $x \in V \subseteq M$ with $U, V$ open, then
   $U \cap V$ is open by (T3) and $x \in U \cap V \subseteq N \cap M$. By
   iteration the same holds for any intersection of finitely many
   neighbourhoods of $x$.
4. *A set is open exactly when it is a neighbourhood of each of its points.* If
   $U$ is open and $x \in U$ then $x \in U \subseteq U$. Conversely, if $N$ is a
   neighbourhood of each of its points, choose for each $x \in N$ an open $U_x$
   with $x \in U_x \subseteq N$; then $N = \bigcup_{x \in N} U_x$ is open by (T2).
   No choice principle is involved: $U_x$ may be taken to be the union of *all*
   open subsets of $N$ containing $x$, which is determined by $x$ and $N$, and is
   open by (T2).

**Basic sets give neighbourhood bases.** If $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for
$\mathcal{T}$ ([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]) then
$\mathcal{B}_x := \{\, B \in \mathcal{B} : x \in B \,\}$ is a neighbourhood base
at $x$ consisting of open sets. Each such $B$ is open and contains $x$, hence is
a neighbourhood of $x$; and if $N \in \mathcal{N}(x)$, fix open $U$ with
$x \in U \subseteq N$ and then $B \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B \subseteq U$,
which gives $B \in \mathcal{B}_x$ with $B \subseteq N$. A member of
$\mathcal{B}_x$ is called a **basic neighbourhood** of $x$.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `def-product-topology`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/def-product-topology.md` — definition — The product set $\\prod_{i \\in I} X_i$ of functions choosing a point in each factor, the projections, the box topology, and the product topology as the initial topology of the projections; the empty product is a one-point space

#### Definition

**The product set.** Let $I$ be a set and let $X_i$ be a set for each $i \in I$.
The **product** is

$$\prod_{i \in I} X_i \;:=\; \Big\{\, x : x \text{ is a function with domain } I \text{ and } x(i) \in X_i \text{ for every } i \in I \,\Big\},$$

and we write $x_i := x(i)$, the $i$-th **coordinate** of $x$. Two elements of the
product are equal exactly when they agree at every index, functions being equal
when they have the same domain and the same values. For $j \in I$ the $j$-th
**projection** is

$$\pi_j : \prod_{i \in I} X_i \to X_j, \qquad \pi_j(x) := x_j .$$

**Notation for a finite product.** For $I = n$ a natural number, which is the set
$\{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ of its predecessors, an element of $\prod_{k<n} X_k$ is a
function on $n$ and we write it $(x_0, \dots, x_{n-1})$. In particular $I = 2$
gives the **binary product**, written $X \times Y$ for $\prod_{i<2} X_i$ with
$X_0 = X$ and $X_1 = Y$, whose elements are written $(u,v)$ for the function
$0 \mapsto u$, $1 \mapsto v$. This is the only meaning the symbol $X \times Y$
carries on this page.

**Two facts about when the product is nonempty, stated because they are used and
because they cost something.** If some $X_{i_0}$ is empty then the product is
empty, since no function can take a value in $X_{i_0}$. Conversely, suppose every
$X_i$ is nonempty.

- For $I = n$ a natural number, the product is nonempty, and this is a theorem of
  ZF: [[lem-finite-choice]] applied to the function $i \mapsto X_i$ on $n$
  supplies a choice function $g$ for the family of values, and
  $x(i) := g(X_i)$ defines a member of $\prod_{k<n} X_k$.
- For an arbitrary $I$ the assertion "$\prod_{i \in I} X_i \ne \varnothing$
  whenever every $X_i$ is nonempty" **is** the Axiom of Choice: it is the
  formulation recorded in [[def-axiom-of-choice]], and the choice function of
  [[def-choice-function]] is exactly a point of the product of a family by
  itself. Every use of it below is flagged at the step that spends it.

**The box topology.** Now let each $X_i$ carry a topology $\mathcal{T}_i$
([[def-topological-space]]). Put

$$\mathcal{R} \;:=\; \Big\{\, \prod_{i \in I} U_i \;:\; U_i \in \mathcal{T}_i \text{ for every } i \in I \,\Big\},$$

the family of **boxes**. $\mathcal{R}$ is a basis for a topology
([[thm-basis-criterion]]): it contains $\prod_i X_i$, so it covers the product,
and it is closed under binary intersections, since

$$\Big(\prod_i U_i\Big) \cap \Big(\prod_i V_i\Big) = \prod_i (U_i \cap V_i)$$

and each $U_i \cap V_i$ is open by (T3). The topology it generates is the **box
topology** $\mathcal{T}^{\square}$, and $\mathcal{R}$ is a basis for it
([[def-topology-basis-subbasis]]).

**The product topology.** The **product topology** $\mathcal{T}^{\Pi}$ on
$\prod_i X_i$ is the initial topology of the family of projections
$(\pi_i)_{i \in I}$ ([[def-initial-and-final-topology]]): the topology generated
by the subbasis

$$\mathcal{G} \;:=\; \{\, \pi_i^{-1}[U] : i \in I,\ U \in \mathcal{T}_i \,\}, \qquad \pi_i^{-1}[U] = \prod_{j \in I} W_j \ \text{ with } W_i = U \text{ and } W_j = X_j \text{ for } j \ne i .$$

By [[thm-basis-criterion]] the finite intersections of members of $\mathcal{G}$
form a basis for $\mathcal{T}^{\Pi}$, and those finite intersections are exactly
the boxes with all but finitely many factors unrestricted:

$$\mathcal{R}^{\Pi} \;=\; \Big\{\, \prod_{i \in I} U_i \;:\; U_i \in \mathcal{T}_i \text{ for every } i, \text{ and } U_i = X_i \text{ for all but finitely many } i \,\Big\}.$$

Indeed the intersection of $\pi_{i_1}^{-1}[U_1], \dots, \pi_{i_n}^{-1}[U_n]$ is
the box whose factor at $i$ is the intersection of those $U_m$ with $i_m = i$ and
is $X_i$ when no $i_m$ equals $i$; and the intersection of no members is the
whole product, the box with every factor $X_i$. Conversely a box with
$U_i = X_i$ off a finite set is such an intersection. Members of
$\mathcal{R}^{\Pi}$ are called **basic product-open** sets, and members of
$\mathcal{R}$ **boxes**. So $\mathcal{R}^{\Pi} \subseteq \mathcal{R}$, with
equality when $I$ is a natural number.

**The empty product.** For $I = \varnothing$ there is exactly one function with
domain $\varnothing$, the empty function, so $\prod_{i \in \varnothing} X_i$ is a
one-point set. A one-point set carries exactly one topology, namely
$\{\varnothing, \{\varnothing\}\}$, since a topology must contain the empty set
and the whole set and there is nothing else to contain
([[def-topological-space]]); so the box topology and the product topology agree
there, and both equal the discrete topology and the indiscrete topology
([[def-standard-topologies]]), which coincide on a one-point set. There are no
projections to speak of, and the initial topology of the empty family is indeed
the indiscrete one ([[def-initial-and-final-topology]]).

**Convention.** Unless the box topology is named explicitly, $\prod_i X_i$ always
carries the product topology in this library. That is not a matter of taste: the
product topology is the one with the characteristic property of the next item,
and the box topology has no such property.

`items/def-metric-compactness.md` — definition — Open cover, subcover, compact metric space, and compact subset of a metric space

#### Definition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space ([[def-metric-space]]), with open sets as in
[[def-metric-topology]] and balls as in [[def-metric-ball]].

- An **open cover** of $(X,d)$ is a family $\mathcal{U}$ of open subsets of $X$
  with $X = \bigcup \mathcal{U}$, where
  $\bigcup \mathcal{U} = \{\, x \in X : x \in U \text{ for some } U \in \mathcal{U} \,\}$.
- A **subcover** of $\mathcal{U}$ is a subfamily
  $\mathcal{V} \subseteq \mathcal{U}$ that is itself an open cover.
- A family $\mathcal{V}$ of sets is **finite** when $\mathcal{V} = \emptyset$ or
  there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and sets $V_0, \dots, V_n$ with
  $\mathcal{V} = \{V_0, \dots, V_n\}$; repetitions in the list are allowed and
  harmless.
- $(X,d)$ is **compact** when every open cover of it has a finite subcover: for
  every open cover $\mathcal{U}$, either $X = \emptyset$ and the empty subfamily
  covers it, or there are $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
  $U_0, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{U}$ with
  $$X = U_0 \cup \dots \cup U_n .$$
- A subset $A \subseteq X$ is a **compact subset** of $X$ when the metric
  subspace $(A, d_A)$ is a compact metric space, $d_A$ being the restriction of
  $d$ to $A \times A$ ([[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]).

**Compactness of a subset is defined intrinsically, and only intrinsically.**
The last clause speaks about the subspace $(A,d_A)$ and its own open sets, not
about families of open subsets of the ambient $X$. The two readings do agree,
but that is a theorem and not a convention: it is
[[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]], and no item of this library may use the
ambient reading without citing it. Taking the intrinsic reading as the
definition is what makes "compact" a property of the metric space $(A,d_A)$
alone, so that a set compact in one ambient space is compact in every other one
containing it isometrically.

**The empty space is compact**, since the empty subfamily of any family covers
it; this is the reason the clause above is written with the two cases. The
one-point space is compact too, and so is every space listed as
$\{x_0, \dots, x_n\}$: given a cover, each $x_i$ lies in some member, and
finitely many members chosen in this way already cover.

**The finiteness convention, and how it is used both ways.** "Finite" above is
the listing form, matching the finite lists of
[[def-finite-intersection-property]]. It agrees with the definition of
finiteness by equinumerosity with a natural number ([[def-countable]]), and
both directions of the agreement are available and are used below:

- A nonempty finite set $F$ in the sense of [[def-countable]] satisfies
  $F \approx m$ for some $m \ge 1$, and a bijection $m \to F$ is exactly a
  listing $F = \{a_0, \dots, a_{m-1}\}$.
- Conversely a set listed as $A = \{a_0, \dots, a_n\}$, that is the image of a
  function $a$ with domain $\sigma(n)$, is finite in the sense of
  [[def-countable]]: the map sending $x \in A$ to the least $i \le n$ with
  $a_i = x$ is an injection of $A$ into $\sigma(n)$, so $A$ is equinumerous with
  a subset of $\mathbb{N}$ bounded above, and such a subset is finite
  ([[lem-subset-of-countable]]).

Neither direction uses a choice principle: the second selects nothing, taking a
least index instead.

Title: Tube lemma: if $K$ is a compact subset of a metric space $X$, $Z$ is a topological space and $N$ is open in $X \\times Z$ with $K \\times \\{z_0\\} \\subseteq N$, then $K \\times W \\subseteq N$ for some open $W \\ni z_0$

Title: For a metric domain and a metric target the compact-open topology on $C(X,Y)$ is the topology of compact convergence

- [L7] $\bar B(a,r)$ is closed and $B(a,r)$ is open in $(X,d_X)$; relative openness in a subspace is tracing, so a closed subset of $X$ traces to a closed subset of any metric subspace, and a closed subset of a compact metric space is compact ([[thm-metric-open-set-algebra]], [[def-metric-topology]], [[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]], [[lem-closed-subset-of-a-compact-space-is-compact]], [[def-metric-ball]], [[def-metric-compactness]]).

### `thm-comparison-of-the-three-function-space-topologies` (published-backward, page function-space-topologies)

Title: On $C(X,Y)$ with $X$ and $Y$ metric, uniform convergence is finer than compact convergence, which is finer than pointwise convergence

- [L5] A one-point subset of a metric space is compact, the one-point metric space being compact ([[def-metric-compactness]], [[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]], [[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]]).

### `thm-dini` (published-backward, page function-space-topologies)

Title: Dini's theorem: on a compact metric space a nondecreasing sequence of continuous real functions converging pointwise to a continuous limit converges uniformly

- Let $(X,d)$ be a compact metric space ([[def-metric-compactness]]), let
- [L6] $X$ is a compact subset of itself, so every family $(U_i)_{i \in I}$ of open subsets of $X$ with $X = \bigcup_i U_i$ has $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and indices $i_0, \dots, i_n \in I$ with $X = U_{i_0} \cup \dots \cup U_{i_n}$, unless $X = \varnothing$ ([[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]], claim 3, [[def-metric-compactness]]).

Title: If $X$ is a locally compact metric space then the evaluation map is continuous for the compact-open topology

- [L4] Local compactness at $x$ gives a real $r_0 > 0$ such that $\bar B(x,r)$ is compact for every real $r$ with $0 < r < r_0$ ([[lem-compact-closed-balls-in-a-locally-compact-metric-space]], [[def-locally-compact-metric-space]], [[def-metric-compactness]]).

### `thm-exponential-correspondence-is-continuous` (published-backward, page function-space-topologies)

Title: If $f : X \\times Z \\to Y$ is continuous then its transpose $F : Z \\to C(X,Y)$, $F(z)(x) = f(x,z)$, is continuous for the compact-open topology, with no hypothesis on $X$ beyond being metric

- [L6] The sets $S(K,V) = \{\, g \in C(X,Y) : g[K] \subseteq V \,\}$, for compact $K \subseteq X$ and open $V \subseteq Y$, are a subbasis for the compact-open topology on $C(X,Y)$ ([[def-compact-open-topology]], [[def-metric-compactness]], [[lem-compactness-is-intrinsic]]).
