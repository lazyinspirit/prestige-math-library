# Citation-precision audit — do these citing items state their target correctly?

You are reading a **published legacy corpus** of this library. Below are one or
more TARGET items, each quoted as it actually stands on disk, followed by every
place in this audit wave that cites it.

**The one question for every citing line:** does the citing text state the
target's own proposition — same domain, same quantifiers, same hypotheses, same
direction, same strength — or does it state something the target does not
actually give? A fact that quietly drops a hypothesis, flips an implication,
promotes an implication to a biconditional, or widens a domain is a **FATAL**
defect of the incorrect-dependency-citation class. It is this library's single
most common confirmed defect, and it is only visible by reading the two texts
against each other, which is what this file lets you do.

Do NOT report: a concise but faithful shortening (that is the required house
style); a paraphrase that preserves content; wording you would have chosen
differently; missing URLs; prose style. A citing line reading as a shortened
but faithful version of the target is CORRECT and must not be flagged.

Where a citing line says a dependency is declared but never cited in the body,
say whether that looks like a stale declaration or a use that lost its citation
— that one is NONFATAL either way.

For every finding use the block format from the brief, and finish with the
`N fatal, M nonfatal` line. If every citation is faithful, say so plainly and
name the targets you checked.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `thm-euclidean-space-complete`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/thm-euclidean-space-complete.md` — theorem — $\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n \\ge 1$ with the Euclidean metric are complete, componentwise from the Cauchy criterion in $\\mathbb{R}$

#### Statement

1. $(\mathbb{R}, d_{\mathbb{R}})$ with the usual metric $d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y) = |x-y|$
   ([[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]) is a complete metric space
   ([[def-complete-metric-space]]).
2. Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \ge 1$ and let $d_2$ be the Euclidean metric on
   $\mathbb{R}^n$ ([[lem-metrics-on-rn]]). Then $(\mathbb{R}^n, d_2)$ is complete.

**The hypothesis $n \ge 1$ is inherited and is not decoration.**
[[lem-metrics-on-rn]] defines $\mathbb{R}^n$ and its three metrics only for
$n \ge 1$, because at $n = 0$ the metric $d_\infty$ would be a maximum over the
empty index set. Every statement about $\mathbb{R}^n$ in this library carries the
hypothesis, and this one does too.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `lem-nat-trichotomy`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/lem-nat-trichotomy.md` — lemma — Trichotomy of the order on $\\mathbb{N}$

#### Statement

For all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ exactly one of $m < n$, $m = n$, $m > n$ holds. In particular the order ([[def-nat-order]]) is total.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `thm-compact-subset-of-a-hausdorff-space-is-closed`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/thm-compact-subset-of-a-hausdorff-space-is-closed.md` — theorem — In a Hausdorff space a point and a disjoint compact set, and two disjoint compact sets, have disjoint open neighbourhoods; hence every compact subset is closed, and in a compact Hausdorff space the compact subsets are exactly the closed ones

#### Statement

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a Hausdorff topological space
([[def-hausdorff-space]], [[def-topological-space]]), with compact subsets as in
[[def-compact-space]]. Then:

1. **A point and a disjoint compact set are separated.** If $K \subseteq X$ is
   compact and $x \in X \setminus K$, there are $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$ with
   $$x \in U, \qquad K \subseteq V, \qquad U \cap V = \varnothing .$$
2. **Two disjoint compact sets are separated.** If $K, L \subseteq X$ are compact
   and $K \cap L = \varnothing$, there are $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$ with
   $$L \subseteq U, \qquad K \subseteq V, \qquad U \cap V = \varnothing .$$
3. **Compact implies closed.** Every compact subset of $X$ is closed in $X$.
4. **In a compact Hausdorff space the two classes coincide.** If in addition
   $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is compact, then a subset of $X$ is compact if and only if
   it is closed.

**The proof is written choice-free, and that is not a stylistic preference.** The
textbook argument says "for each $y \in K$ choose disjoint open $U_y, V_y$",
which is a selection over an arbitrary index set and therefore an appeal to the
full Axiom of Choice. What is done below instead is to take the family of **all**
open $V$ that admit some open $U \ni x$ disjoint from them — a family cut out by
a formula, with nothing selected — extract a finite subcover from it, and only
then make finitely many selections, which [[lem-finite-choice]] supplies as a
theorem of ZF.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `fs-every-regular-space-is-normal`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/fs-every-regular-space-is-normal.md` — false-statement — Assuming countable choice, refuted: every regular space is normal

#### Statement

Assuming the Axiom of Countable Choice, every regular space is normal.

## The 1 citing use(s), quoted verbatim from the citing items

### `ex-sierpinski-space-is-t0-normal-and-not-regular` (forward, page separation-axioms-examples)

Title: Sierpinski space is $T_0$ and normal but neither $T_1$ nor regular: normality without $T_1$ implies nothing

- - **Normality without $T_1$ does not imply regularity.** This space is normal and not regular. Other combinations occur too: the indiscrete two-point space is regular and normal but not $T_0$, and the cofinite topology on an infinite set is $T_1$ and neither regular nor normal, both worked on this page. This page leaves the converse open; it is refuted later by [[fs-every-regular-space-is-normal]]. Only with $T_1$ does normality imply regularity ([[def-normal-and-t4-spaces]]).
