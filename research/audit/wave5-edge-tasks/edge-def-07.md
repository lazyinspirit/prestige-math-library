# Citation-precision audit — do these citing items state their target correctly?

You are reading a **published legacy corpus** of this library. Below are one or
more TARGET items, each quoted as it actually stands on disk, followed by every
place in this audit wave that cites it.

**The one question for every citing line:** does the citing text state the
target's own proposition — same domain, same quantifiers, same hypotheses, same
direction, same strength — or does it state something the target does not
actually give? A fact that quietly drops a hypothesis, flips an implication,
promotes an implication to a biconditional, or widens a domain is a **FATAL**
defect of the incorrect-dependency-citation class. It is this library's single
most common confirmed defect, and it is only visible by reading the two texts
against each other, which is what this file lets you do.

Do NOT report: a concise but faithful shortening (that is the required house
style); a paraphrase that preserves content; wording you would have chosen
differently; missing URLs; prose style. A citing line reading as a shortened
but faithful version of the target is CORRECT and must not be flagged.

Where a citing line says a dependency is declared but never cited in the body,
say whether that looks like a stale declaration or a use that lost its citation
— that one is NONFATAL either way.

For every finding use the block format from the brief, and finish with the
`N fatal, M nonfatal` line. If every citation is faithful, say so plainly and
name the targets you checked.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `def-bounded-set`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/def-bounded-set.md` — definition — Lower bound, bounded below, bounded set

#### Definition

Throughout, $\mathbb{R}$ denotes the complete ordered field
([[def-complete-ordered-field]]) and $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a subset of it.

The notions **upper bound** and **bounded above** are already fixed by
[[def-complete-ordered-field]] and are only recalled here, never redefined:
$u \in \mathbb{R}$ is an *upper bound* of $S$ if $s \le u$ for all $s \in S$, and
$S$ is *bounded above* if it has at least one upper bound. The dual notions are:

- $\ell \in \mathbb{R}$ is a **lower bound** of $S$ if $\ell \le s$ for all $s \in S$.
- $S$ is **bounded below** if it has at least one lower bound.
- $S$ is **bounded** if it is both bounded above and bounded below, that is, if
  there are $\ell, u \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\ell \le s \le u$ for every $s \in S$.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `def-isometry-and-metric-embedding`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/def-isometry-and-metric-embedding.md` — definition — Isometry, isometric embedding, and the subspace metric on a subset

#### Definition

Let $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ be metric spaces ([[def-metric-space]]).

**Isometric embedding and isometry.** A function $f : X \to Y$ is an
**isometric embedding** if

$$d_Y\big(f(x), f(x')\big) = d_X(x,x') \qquad \text{for all } x, x' \in X ,$$

and an **isometry** if it is in addition bijective
([[def-injection-surjection-bijection]]). Two metric spaces are **isometric** if
some isometry between them exists.

**Subspace metric.** Let $A \subseteq X$ and let

$$d_A := d_X \restriction (A \times A)$$

be the restriction of $d_X$ to pairs from $A$. Then $d_A$ is a metric on $A$:
the three axioms (M1), (M2), (M3) of [[def-metric-space]] are conditions on
triples of points, and each holds for points of $A$ because it holds for points
of $X$. The pair $(A, d_A)$ is the **metric subspace** $A$ of $X$, and the
inclusion $A \to X$ is an isometric embedding by construction. The metric
topology of $d_A$ ([[def-metric-topology]]) is the **subspace topology** of $A$.

**Balls of a subspace are traces of balls of the ambient space.** For $a \in A$
and $r > 0$,

$$B_A(a,r) = B_X(a,r) \cap A ,$$

directly from the definitions: a point $z$ lies in the left side exactly when
$z \in A$ and $d_A(a,z) = d_X(a,z) < r$ ([[def-metric-ball]]). This is why the
ambient space is always written into the ball notation, and it is the source of
every apparent paradox about balls in subspaces.

# Citation-precision audit — everything that cites `def-metric-continuity`

## The target, as it actually stands on disk

`items/def-metric-continuity.md` — definition — Continuity of a map between metric spaces, at a point and globally, in the $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ form

#### Definition

Let $(X, d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$ be metric spaces ([[def-metric-space]]), let
$f : X \to Y$ be a function and let $a \in X$.

$f$ is **continuous at $a$** if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real
$\delta > 0$ such that

$$d_X(x,a) < \delta \;\Longrightarrow\; d_Y\big(f(x), f(a)\big) < \varepsilon \qquad \text{for all } x \in X .$$

$f$ is **continuous** (globally, or on $X$) if it is continuous at every point of
$X$.

**The same condition in balls.** Since $d_X(x,a) < \delta$ says $x \in B_X(a,\delta)$
and $d_Y(f(x),f(a)) < \varepsilon$ says $f(x) \in B_Y(f(a),\varepsilon)$
([[def-metric-ball]]), continuity at $a$ reads: for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there
is $\delta > 0$ with

$$f\big[B_X(a,\delta)\big] \subseteq B_Y\big(f(a), \varepsilon\big).$$

Both forms are used below and are the same statement written twice.

**Both metrics matter, and both are named.** Continuity is a property of the
triple $(d_X, d_Y, f)$, not of $f$ alone. When several metrics on the same
underlying sets are in play, as in [[def-equivalent-metrics]], the metrics are
always written out.

**Quantifier order.** The $\delta$ is allowed to depend on $\varepsilon$ **and on
the point $a$**. Requiring one $\delta$ to work at every point simultaneously is
a strictly stronger condition, uniform continuity; it is defined on a later page
of this library, and at this point in the reading order it is written out in full
where needed ([[def-equivalent-metrics]]).

Title: For a metric domain and a metric target the compact-open topology on $C(X,Y)$ is the topology of compact convergence

- [L6] A continuous real-valued function on a nonempty compact metric space attains a least and a greatest value, and the restriction of a continuous map to a metric subspace is continuous ([[thm-extreme-value-metric]], [[def-metric-continuity]], [[def-isometry-and-metric-embedding]], [[lem-real-line-is-a-metric-space]]).

Title: In a metric space every closed set is a zero set and a $G_\\delta$, and the distance function separates a point from a closed set, so every metrizable space is Tychonoff and perfectly normal

- [L3] A map between metric spaces satisfying an inequality $|g(x) - g(y)| \le L\, d(x,y)$ with $L > 0$ is continuous in the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ sense, by $\delta := \varepsilon / L$, and is therefore continuous as a map of topological spaces ([[def-metric-continuity]], [[thm-metric-continuity-characterisations]], clause (b), [[def-metrizable-space]]).

#### Definition

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]). The **absolute value** of
$x \in F$ is

$$|x| \;:=\; \begin{cases} x & \text{if } x \ge 0, \\ -x & \text{if } x < 0. \end{cases}$$
