## Statement

Let $F$ be an ordered field ([[def-ordered-field]]) and let $x, y \in F$. Then

$$|x + y| \le |x| + |y|.$$

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** An ordered field $F$ and elements $x, y \in F$.

[L1] For every $u \in F$, $-|u| \le u \le |u|$, and $|u|$ equals $u$ or $-u$ ([[lem-of-abs-value]]).

[L2] Order compatible with addition: if $a \le b$ and $c \le d$, then $a + c \le b + d$. [[lem-of-add-order]] states the STRICT forms and only those ($a < b \Rightarrow a + c < b + c$, and $a < b$ with $c < d$ giving $a + c < b + d$); the nonstrict form used here is those two together with the cases $a = b$ and $c = d$, settled by trichotomy, the order being total ([[def-ordered-field]]). Explicitly: if $a < b$ and $c < d$ the second strict form applies; if $a < b$ and $c = d$ the first gives $a + c < b + c = b + d$; if $a = b$ and $c < d$ the first gives $a + c < a + d = b + d$; and if $a = b$ and $c = d$ the two sides are equal.

[L3] Field and order arithmetic: $-(a + b) = -a + (-b)$, and $a \le b \iff -b \le -a$ ([[def-ordered-field]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 By [L1], $-|x| \le x \le |x|$ and $-|y| \le y \le |y|$. [L1]

2.1 Adding the two chains of [step 1.1] with [L2] and using $-(|x| + |y|) = -|x| + (-|y|)$ from [L3] gives $-(|x| + |y|) \le x + y \le |x| + |y|$. [step 1.1, L2, L3]

3.1 By [L1] the value $|x + y|$ equals $x + y$ or $-(x + y)$; both $x + y \le |x| + |y|$ and $-(x + y) \le |x| + |y|$ hold by [step 2.1] and [L3] (the latter from $-(|x| + |y|) \le x + y$), so $|x + y| \le |x| + |y|$. [step 2.1, L1, L3] ∎
