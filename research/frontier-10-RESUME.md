# `frontier-10` — run record

Started 2026-08-11. Branch `feat/coverage-harvest-and-frontier-10`, baseline
`2b6e537`. Run under `LEVELS.md` steps 0 to 10.

## The owner's request

> Start building all non-topology A/B pairs, as well as adding orbit stabilizer
> theorem and its consequences and examples to "group actions" A/B pair.

Preceded by a diagnosis the owner asked to be carried forward:

> I am not confident with how Beta agents are instructed to fetch sufficient
> amount of knowledge from the open web. We need textbooks, lecture notes, and
> other rich sources of knowledge, not just wikipedia. Keep this in mind.

Amended mid-run, twice:

> Instruct Beta agents to build all prerequisite definitions and theorems if a
> theorem requires them. Do not take the lazy approach and drop an important
> result; build all necessary machinery. If an A page gets too large (over 60
> items), split it into two or more A pages.

> Make sure this is enforced for all future sessions as well.

## Mechanism changes made BEFORE dispatch (both committed)

`a0614cf` — the omission gate. `tools/coverage-checklist.mjs`, required at steps
2 and 6. Per A page: ≥2 independent treatments, ≥1 textbook/monograph/full note
set, per source the exact range read plus that source's own section and
named-result headings, per heading a disposition. `ARCHITECTURE.md` §3.11b.
Also gave the `beta` and `reader` dispatch lanes `web: true`.

`ed4fb82` — build the machinery; split at 60. `validate-plan.mjs --max-items`
default 100 → 60 and `size` moved from WARN to ERROR.

**Diagnosis behind them, for anyone re-reading this later.** The thin pages were
not caused by bad sources. frontier-9's batch notes cite Sharifi (UCLA), Brosnan
(UMD), Judson, Axler, Diestel. The defect was that a Beta could cite a source
without harvesting it: Brosnan's note titled *Orbits and stabilizers* was logged
as covering "orbit structure" and the orbit–stabiliser theorem never reached the
scaffold. frontier-9 shipped 83 items across 20 pages — about 4 per page.
frontier-9's dispatch transcripts were not retained, so whether its Betas
actually fetched or asserted from memory could not be established either way.

## Scope — 12 pair-units

Eleven new non-topology pairs, from the 15 buildable today (`LEVELS.md` §Step 0
frontier rule, computed from disk). The four topology pairs
(`complete-metrizability-and-baire`, `ascoli-arzela`, `stone-weierstrass-general`,
`covering-spaces-and-lifting`) are **deliberately excluded** by the owner's
"non-topology" scope and remain buildable for a later run.

Two scope readings recorded rather than escalated:
`plane-graphs-euler-and-the-five-colour-theorem` is IN — its category is
`combinatorics` and it is graph theory, notwithstanding the planar-topology
subject matter. `categories-functors-and-natural-transformations` is IN — its
category is `category-theory`.

## Batches — 8, all seam-free

**Zero cross-batch dependency edges.** None of the eleven A pages requires
another, so they are provably mutually independent and any grouping is seam-free
at page level. Grouping is therefore by *shared prerequisite* (one Beta reads one
dependency set twice) and by downstream co-unblocking, not by seam burial.

| batch | A pages | why grouped |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | symmetric-groups-and-the-sign-homomorphism (44), matrices-and-the-matrix-of-a-linear-map (78) | jointly the two blockers of `determinants-of-matrices-over-a-commutative-ring` (82) |
| 2 | the-structure-of-finite-abelian-groups (40), free-products-and-amalgamation (62) | group theory, both level 17 |
| 3 | polynomial-rings-and-roots (52) | solo — ring theory, feeds 4 pending pages |
| 4 | bounded-variation-and-riemann-stieltjes (163), improper-integrals (165) | identical single prerequisite |
| 5 | fubini-and-change-of-variables (237) | solo |
| 6 | ramsey-theory (217), plane-graphs-euler-and-the-five-colour-theorem (357) | both from `graph-colouring` |
| 7 | categories-functors-and-natural-transformations (359) | solo — 8 prerequisites across four subjects |
| 8 | group-actions-and-cayleys-theorem (42) | **ENRICHMENT of a published pair** |

Three solo batches are deliberate, not leftovers. The cap is *at most* two pairs
per Beta, not exactly two, and the owner's complaint is about depth: a Beta
holding one meaty topic can harvest it further than one holding two.

## Batch 8 — the enrichment

`group-actions-and-cayleys-theorem` is `status: published` with **6 items** and
`examples: []`. It has `def-orbit-and-stabilizer`, `lem-stabilizer-is-a-subgroup`
and `thm-orbits-partition-the-set` but **not the orbit–stabiliser theorem
itself**, and no class equation, Cauchy's theorem, Burnside/Cauchy–Frobenius, or
p-group fixed-point results. The B page has no items at all.

Follows the `freegroups-1` precedent (its D4): both pages are published, and
`depcheck` raises `draft-on-published-page` when a published page lists a
non-published item. So **every new item is authored `status: draft`**, and the
additions to the two pages' `items:`/`examples:` lists are **staged** in
`research/frontier-10-published-amendments.md` and applied only in the single
publishing commit, together with the status flips.

Its manifest lists **only ids the batch mints**; the 7 already-published ids are
recorded under `enrichment_of_published` as context. Listing them as batch items
is what `content-policy.mjs` rejects with `batch-item-already-exists` — that was
the first step-0 failure of this run.

## Mid-run owner instructions (2026-08-11), all landed before step 3

- **`\iota` gone from the free-groups pair**, with rejudge/restamp explicitly
  waived. 12 items, commit `cce8d63`. Full record and the one non-cosmetic spot:
  `research/frontier-10-notation-change.md`.
- **Alpha reviews scaffold breadth and depth at the end of step 3**, standing for
  all future sessions. Alpha now spawns at step 3, not step 4. Commit `fa4448b`;
  `briefs/alpha.md` §"Stage 0", `LEVELS.md` §"Step 3".
  **This binds the current run** — step 3 is not complete until
  `research/frontier-10-alpha-step3-scaffold-review.md` exists and every pair is
  `sufficient`.

## State — step 3, second repair round

- **Steps 0, 1, 2 CLEAR.** Step 0 passes over all 9 batches: **579 scoped items,
  0 errors**.
- **Run is 14 A/B pairs** (12 original + batch 9's 2, spliced at step 3 per D1).
  579 newly minted ids; 586 items in the spec after splice, the extra 7 being the
  published items the group-actions enrichment appends to.
- **Alpha Stage-0 review + re-check both done**, in
  `research/frontier-10-alpha-step3-scaffold-review.md` (59 KB). First pass:
  5 sufficient / 7 insufficient. Re-check: **7 resolved**, 3 sent back
  (batch 8 R2; batch 9 R3, R4), 1 routed to the orchestrator (R1).
- **F1 closed and independently verified.** Zero forward references to the
  re-homed items anywhere in the run — checked across every batch manifest, not
  just the ones Alpha named. Alpha additionally verified from disk that the moved
  items have no forward wikilinks, no falsified positional prose, that the source
  page's summary survives the move, and that no published consumer loses closure.
- **R1 (orchestrator, done).** The re-home puts two items on
  `rings-subrings-and-integral-domains` (46) whose own dependencies live on
  `finite-counting-and-binomial-coefficients` (20), which that page does not
  require — `undeclared-prereq` once applied. No batch owns the edge; it is a
  consequence of the move. Taught to `research/frontier-10-splice.mjs`.
- **Step 4 is scripted and dry-run clean**: `research/frontier-10-splice.mjs`,
  `--apply` to write, backup taken automatically. Two bugs it caught before they
  shipped: replacing rather than appending would have **deleted the 6 published
  items** from the group-actions page, and `EXTRA_REQUIRES` silently dropped any
  edge on a page no batch manifest contains (exactly R1's case).
- **RUNNING**: batch 8 repair 2 (R2), batch 9 repair 2 (R3, R4).

## Exact next action

Await batch 8 and batch 9 repair round 2, then **Alpha re-checks those three
pairs only**. When all read `resolved`:

```
node research/frontier-10-splice.mjs --apply
node tools/gates.mjs --step 4 --run frontier-10
```

Then step 5: dispatch 9 authoring Betas on
`research/frontier-10-brief-authoring.md`, one per batch, `--var i=<batch>`.

The re-home's page-list edits — removing the two ids from
`incidence-algebras-and-mobius-inversion`, adding them to
`rings-subrings-and-integral-domains`, **plus R1's `requires` edge** — stay
staged for the publishing commit per ARCHITECTURE §3.11a.
`research/frontier-10-published-amendments.md` still does not exist and must be
written before publish; it carries both the re-home edits and batch 8's
enrichment additions.

## Open risks

- The coverage gate is new and has never run against a real Beta's output. Its
  four paths were verified against fixtures only.
- The 60-item ceiling is now a hard error and the build-the-machinery rule pushes
  pages toward it. Expect split proposals at step 2; those are Step-3
  orchestrator decisions and need `plan-spec.json` order insertions at step 4.
- `run-wave.test.mjs` has 2 pre-existing failures at baseline `2b6e537`
  (A10 owner-pause exit code). Untouched by this run; audit driver, not build.
