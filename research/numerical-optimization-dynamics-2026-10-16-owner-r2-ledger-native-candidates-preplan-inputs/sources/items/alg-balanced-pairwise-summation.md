## Definition

Input real floating-point x_1,...,x_n, n>=1. Set d=ceil(log_2 n), append 2^d-n exact zero leaves, and round the sum at each internal node of the balanced tree. An unmatched leaf may be copied. If a rounded node fails the operationwise range rule, return range-failure and its tree index; otherwise return the root s-hat. This finite tree terminates after 2^d-1 additions; accuracy is asserted only on success.

## Facts & Assumptions
**Given:** a finite input of the stated type and the operationwise arithmetic model.

[F1] [[def-operationwise-real-complex-floating-point-model-with-sqrt-and-fma]]: each successful elementary operation returns a finite value, and an invalid or out-of-range operation returns a failure status.

## Proof

1.1 Every loop index ranges over the finite input length or matrix dimensions; any branch test in the definition is a comparison of already supplied finite values. [given, choose]

2.1 At each operation the model [F1] either returns a finite next value or the defined failure status, and every loop has its stated finite bound. Thus execution terminates with the specified output or first failure. [step 1.1, F1, algebra] ∎
