## Statement

Every sequence $(f^{(n)})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $K = \mathbb{R}((t^{-1}))$ that
is Cauchy in $K$ ([[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]]) converges in $K$. That
is, the ordered field $K$ of [[thm-laurent-ordered-field]] is **sequentially
Cauchy complete**.

The limit is built coefficient by coefficient: at each index $j \in \mathbb{Z}$
the real numbers $f^{(n)}(j)$ are eventually constant in $n$, and $L(j)$ is that
eventual value.

## Scratch

The whole theorem turns on one structural fact about $K$, and it is worth
isolating before the proof: **the value group is $\mathbb{Z}$, so it has
countable cofinality.** Concretely, the countably many monomials $t^{-k}$,
$k \in \mathbb{N}$, get below every positive element of $K$
([[lem-laurent-non-archimedean]], clause 3). Two consequences drive everything.

First, the Cauchy condition, which quantifies over the uncountably many positive
$\varepsilon \in K$, is *equivalent* to its restriction to the countable family
$\varepsilon = t^{-(k+1)}$, and by clause 4 of the same lemma that restricted
condition says exactly: for each $k$ the coefficients at all indices $j \le k$
are eventually constant along the sequence.

Second, a sequence indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ is long enough to reach the limit.
For each of the countably many thresholds $t^{-k}$ there is an index $N_k$ past
which the sequence is that close, and $\sup$-free bookkeeping over $\mathbb{N}$
assembles the $N_k$ into a single limit. In a field whose value group had
uncountable cofinality this last step would fail, and a sequence would not
suffice.

The one genuinely non-formal point is that the assembled $L$ must have support
bounded below, so that it is an element of $K$ at all. That does not follow from
the eventual constancy at each index separately; it comes from the *single*
threshold $k = 0$, which already pins down every negative index at once.

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** A sequence $(f^{(n)})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $K$ that is Cauchy in $K$.

[L1] $K$ consists of the functions $\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R}$ whose support is bounded below; $t^{-a}$ is $1$ at index $a$ and $0$ elsewhere ([[def-formal-laurent-series]]).

[L2] $K$ is an ordered field, so its order is transitive and total ([[thm-laurent-ordered-field]], [[def-ordered-field]], [[def-abs-value]]); and $(g - h)(j) = g(j) - h(j)$ for $g, h \in K$ ([[lem-laurent-series-ring]]).

[L3] In $K$: $0_K < t^{-(k+1)} < t^{-k}$ for every $k \in \mathbb{Z}$; for every $\varepsilon > 0$ in $K$ there is $k \in \mathbb{N}$ with $t^{-k} < \varepsilon$; if $h(j) = 0$ for every $j \le k$ then $|h| < t^{-k}$; and if $|h| < t^{-k}$ then $h(j) = 0$ for every $j < k$ ([[lem-laurent-non-archimedean]]).

[L4] $(x_n)$ is Cauchy in $K$ when for every $\varepsilon > 0$ in $K$ there is $N \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|x_n - x_m| < \varepsilon$ for all $n, m \ge N$; and $(x_n)$ converges to $L$ in $K$ when for every $\varepsilon > 0$ in $K$ there is $N$ with $|x_n - L| < \varepsilon$ for all $n \ge N$ ([[def-sequences-in-an-ordered-field]]).

[L5] Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]).

[L6] The order on $\mathbb{N}$ is total ([[thm-nat-linear-order]], [[def-nat-order]]), induction is available ([[thm-induction-principle]], [[def-natural-numbers]]), and every integer $\ge 0$ is the image of a unique natural number, so a natural number may be used as an index in $\mathbb{Z}$ ([[lem-nat-embeds-int]]).

## Proof

**Proof technique:** constructive.

1.1 For $k \in \mathbb{N}$ put $M_k := \{\, N \in \mathbb{N} : |f^{(n)} - f^{(m)}| < t^{-(k+1)} \text{ for all } n, m \ge N \,\}$. Since $t^{-(k+1)} > 0_K$ by [L3] and the sequence is Cauchy, $M_k \ne \varnothing$ by [L4]; let $N_k := \min M_k$, which exists by [L5]. [given, L3, L4, L5, construct]

2.1 For every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, all $n, m \ge N_k$ and every $j \le k$ one has $f^{(n)}(j) = f^{(m)}(j)$: by [step 1.1] $|f^{(n)} - f^{(m)}| < t^{-(k+1)}$, so [L3] gives $(f^{(n)} - f^{(m)})(j) = 0$ for every $j < k+1$, that is for every $j \le k$, and $(f^{(n)} - f^{(m)})(j) = f^{(n)}(j) - f^{(m)}(j)$ by [L2]. [step 1.1, L2, L3, L6]

2.2 $N_a \le N_b$ whenever $a \le b$ in $\mathbb{N}$: for consecutive indices, $t^{-(k+2)} < t^{-(k+1)}$ by [L3], so any $N$ witnessing membership in $M_{k+1}$ also witnesses membership in $M_k$ by transitivity of the order [L2]; hence $M_{k+1} \subseteq M_k$ and $N_k = \min M_k \le \min M_{k+1} = N_{k+1}$. The general case follows by induction on $b$ [L6]. [step 1.1, L2, L3, L6]

2.3 Define $\kappa : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{N}$ by $\kappa(j) := j$ for $j \ge 0$ and $\kappa(j) := 0$ for $j < 0$, so that $j \le \kappa(j)$ for every $j \in \mathbb{Z}$; then define $L : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R}$ by $L(j) := f^{(N_{\kappa(j)})}(j)$. [step 1.1, L6, construct]

3.1 For every $j \in \mathbb{Z}$ and every $n \ge N_{\kappa(j)}$ one has $f^{(n)}(j) = L(j)$: apply [step 2.1] with $k = \kappa(j)$, which is legitimate since $j \le \kappa(j)$, to the two indices $n$ and $N_{\kappa(j)}$, both of which are $\ge N_{\kappa(j)}$. [step 2.1, step 2.3, L6]

3.2 $L \in K$. The series $f^{(N_0)}$ lies in $K$, so by [L1] there is $m_0 \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $f^{(N_0)}(j) = 0$ for every $j < m_0$. If $j < m_0$ and $j < 0$ then $\kappa(j) = 0$, so $L(j) = f^{(N_0)}(j) = 0$; hence $L(j) = 0$ for every $j$ below both $m_0$ and $0$, the support of $L$ is bounded below, and $L \in K$. [step 2.3, L1]

4.1 For every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, every $n \ge N_k$ and every $j \le k$ one has $f^{(n)}(j) = L(j)$: if $j \ge 0$ then $\kappa(j) = j \le k$, and if $j < 0$ then $\kappa(j) = 0 \le k$, so in both cases $N_{\kappa(j)} \le N_k \le n$ by [step 2.2] and [step 3.1] applies. [step 2.2, step 3.1, L6]

5.1 $(f^{(n)})$ converges to $L$ in $K$. Let $\varepsilon > 0$ in $K$. By [L3] — this is the countable-cofinality step, and it is the only place where anything special about $K$ is used — there is $k \in \mathbb{N}$ with $t^{-k} < \varepsilon$. Put $N := N_k$. For every $n \ge N$, [step 4.1] and [L2] give $(f^{(n)} - L)(j) = f^{(n)}(j) - L(j) = 0$ for every $j \le k$, so $|f^{(n)} - L| < t^{-k}$ by [L3] and therefore $|f^{(n)} - L| < \varepsilon$ by transitivity [L2]. As $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary, this is convergence in the sense of [L4]. [step 3.2, step 4.1, L2, L3, L4]

6.1 The sequence $(f^{(n)})$ was an arbitrary Cauchy sequence in $K$, and [step 3.2] and [step 5.1] produce an element $L \in K$ to which it converges; so every Cauchy sequence in $K$ converges in $K$. [step 3.2, step 5.1, discharge-construct] ∎

## Remarks

- **What makes the argument work, in one sentence.** The value group of $K$ is $\mathbb{Z}$, whose cofinality is countable, so the continuum of thresholds $\varepsilon > 0$ in the Cauchy condition collapses to the countable family $t^{-k}$, $k \in \mathbb{N}$ ([[lem-laurent-non-archimedean]], clause 3), and a sequence indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ can meet all of them. A proof that skipped this step would be proving nothing: it is exactly the point at which the countability of the index set $\mathbb{N}$ is matched to the structure of the field.

- **Support-boundedness of the limit is a separate obligation, and it is discharged from a single threshold.** Knowing that each coefficient $f^{(n)}(j)$ is eventually constant gives a function $\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R}$ and nothing more; there is no reason *a priori* why its support should be bounded below. What supplies that is [step 3.2]: the threshold $k = 0$ freezes *all* indices $j \le 0$ simultaneously from the single stage $N_0$ onward, so $L$ agrees with the one series $f^{(N_0)}$ on the whole negative half-line and inherits its lower bound.

- **No choice is used.** The stage $N_k$ is not chosen: it is defined as the least element of $M_k$, which exists by the well-ordering principle ([[thm-well-ordering-principle]]). This matters because the construction makes countably many selections, and a version of it that said "pick some $N_k$" would be an appeal to countable choice for no reason.

- **This is Cauchy completeness and nothing more.** $K$ is sequentially Cauchy complete and at the same time lacks the least-upper-bound property ([[cor-laurent-not-lub-complete]]); the two are not the same condition, and in a non-Archimedean field they come apart. Nor does this theorem give the unrestricted nested interval property: see [[cor-laurent-nested-intervals]] for what it does give, and [[cex-laurent-nested-intervals-empty]] for what it does not.
