# Beta FIX brief for run `frontier-12` (step 3 → 4)

> **NO PERMISSION PROMPTS OF ANY KIND (owner, 2026-07-30; broadened 2026-08-11)
> — binding on you.** The owner's wording: *"Do not ask and do not let any agents
> ask for shell command permissions, edit permissions, web search permissions,
> git permissions, or any permissions whatsoever."* It binds a **compound command
> as a whole — no segment of an `&&` chain may raise a prompt either.** Use
> command forms already allowed inside the workspace sandbox, choose
> non-escalated forms, and pass `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` on every Bash
> call where your runtime exposes it. Web search is part of your job and you never
> ask before searching. If an indispensable operation has no escalation-free form,
> **record a blocker in your notes** — that is the escape hatch, not a prompt.

You already scaffolded this batch on run `frontier-12`. The orchestrator has
settled the step-3 decisions and one of them changes your batch. This dispatch is
that change and **nothing else**.

**Read first:** `research/frontier-12-step3-decisions.md` — the full decision
record, including the reasoning behind the change to your batch. Then
`CLAUDE.md`, `SCHEMA.md` and `briefs/beta-scaffold.md` remain your standing
contract, and your own
`research/frontier-12-batch-5.{pages.json,notes.md,coverage.json,proof-contracts.json}`
are still your only writable outputs.

## Rules for a fix round

1. **Change only what the dispatch names.** Everything else in your scaffold was
   accepted. Do not re-litigate a decline the orchestrator did not raise, and do
   not take the opportunity to restructure a page that was not challenged.
2. **Keep all four artifacts consistent.** A change to `pages.json` that does not
   reach `coverage.json` and `proof-contracts.json` will fail the step-4 gates,
   and a coverage entry whose disposition still says `deferred` for a result you
   have now scaffolded is a false record.
3. **Item ids you already scaffolded stay stable** unless the dispatch explicitly
   reassigns them. Downstream artifacts already reference them.
4. **Leave the gates green:**
   ```
   node tools/coverage-checklist.mjs research/frontier-12-batch-5.coverage.json
   node tools/validate-plan.mjs research/plan-spec.json
   ```
   Do **not** run `tools/gates.mjs`; it fails `EPERM` in this sandbox. You may not
   edit `plan-spec.json` — the orchestrator has already made the page-level edits
   your dispatch depends on, so read it, never write it.
5. **Report** what changed, item by item, and anything you could not do.

# This dispatch

## Batch 5 fix round 2 — Alpha stage-0 findings

**Read `research/frontier-12-alpha-step3-scaffold-review.md` first**, in full.
Alpha opened your sources and checked the harvest against them; every finding
below is backed by source text it actually read. This dispatch is that work and
nothing else — everything Alpha marked `sufficient` stays as scaffolded.

### Your work

The mathematics is not challenged. `finite-probability-and-the-probabilistic-method`
(221) is `sufficient`, and your split was applied correctly with the seam
verified independently.

**§4.5 — `finite-probability-spaces-and-random-variables` (220.2) is
`insufficient` on SOURCING.** Alpha found that **14 of its 37 A items** — Bayes,
total probability, the chain rule, product spaces, the binomial distribution,
Cauchy–Schwarz among them — appear in **no source's contents at all**. The reason
is structural, and it is partly a consequence of the split I ordered:
Matoušek–Vondrák §1.1 opens *"In no way is it intended to serve as a substitute
for a course in probability theory."* All three of your sources treat elementary
probability as a **preface** to the probabilistic method, so the split minted a
page whose subject none of them actually develops.

That is a real defect and the harvest rule is not satisfied by three sources that
skip the subject. Alpha recommends **Grinstead & Snell, *Introduction to
Probability*** (open access) and verified usable chapter ranges — read §4.5 for
them. Add it as a genuine independent treatment for 220.2, harvest the relevant
chapters properly, and give every one of the 14 unsourced items a real row.

Add a second independent treatment for 220.2 if Grinstead & Snell alone does not
cover the range; the rule is at least two independent treatments **per page**,
and after the split 220.2 must satisfy it on its own.

### Standing rules for this round

- Change only what is listed. Do not re-litigate an accepted decline or
  restructure a page that was not challenged.
- Keep all four artifacts consistent — `pages.json`, `coverage.json`,
  `proof-contracts.json`, `notes.md`. A new item with no coverage row, or a
  coverage row still saying `deferred` for something you now scaffold, is a
  false record and fails step 4.
- Item ids already scaffolded stay stable.
- `plan-spec.json` is READ-ONLY to you. The orchestrator has already made every
  page-level edit this dispatch depends on.
- Leave green:
  `node tools/coverage-checklist.mjs research/frontier-12-batch-5.coverage.json`
  and `node tools/validate-plan.mjs research/plan-spec.json`.
  Do **not** run `tools/gates.mjs` (EPERM in this sandbox).
- Report what changed item by item, and anything you could not do.
