# Step 8 adjudication — group **h**, run `frontier-31a`

You are the group Alpha for batches **4**, **15**: 2 A/B pair(s), 4 page(s), 43 item(s), 0 open rejection(s) over 0 item(s).

This is a fresh adjudication context. The durable digest below carries the
findings from the rejection-blind whole-group reading at step 7 without
replaying that reader's transcript. Nothing from step 3, step 6, or another
group is assumed.
Everything below is
derived from disk by `tools/step8-scope.mjs`; no line of it is a judgement
about mathematics.

## What you recorded at step 7

`research/frontier-31a-alpha-h-step8-context.json` is what a group Alpha for this group wrote during step 7,
while the judges were still sweeping and no verdict existed. It records the
conventions your pages fix, which items the rest lean on, which published
dependencies were actually opened, and what already looked thin.

**Its `concerns` list is evidence, not decoration.** Each entry was found with
nobody suggesting where to look. A judge rejection landing at the same place is
two independent readings agreeing and should be very hard to call a
`false_positive`; a rejection landing nowhere near any of them is not thereby
wrong, but it is the case to read most carefully against the text.

It is notes, not authority. Where it and the item files disagree, the files win.

## Read scope, write scope

**Read the entire assigned group and anything it cites.** `items/` holds every published item and
every item this run has built, and your sandbox is the repository root. Open
anything a rejection touches — a published dependency, another group's page,
a definition three levels down. Adjudicating a citation objection without
opening the cited item is exactly what the refuter rule forbids.

**You may write only inside your own group.** A `confirmed_fatal` licenses a
repair to an item in the batches listed above. If a rejection's real defect
lies in an item owned by another group, do not repair it: record the finding
in `research/frontier-31a-step8-cross-group.jsonl` as
`{from_group, item, owning_group, finding, severity, source_rejection:{id,model,context_sha256}}`
and adjudicate your own rejection on what is true. The source tuple is
provenance only; it cannot license a repair to the target. The gate routes a
stable alert to the owning group, and a finding nobody answers fails the stage.

## Your seams

**No dependency edge crosses your group boundary.** Every `requires` your
pages declare points inside your own batches or at published content. A
cross-group finding is therefore unexpected here; if you record one, say
what made you look.

## Step-7 reader warnings

3 warning(s) a Step-7 reader recorded in items you own.
They were read-only and could not repair or adjudicate them. You own these decisions.

- **s8a-35bd272d56c5d8470dbbb80f · `thm-borel-probability-measures-on-polish-spaces-are-inner-regular`** (from group h, gap-a-reader-closes) — Proof 2.1 says that, after replacing each nonempty closed-ball cover member by a point of K_0 and “doubling the radius,” it obtains a finite net. If y and the selected centre p both lie in a closed ball of radius delta, the triangle inequality gives d(y,p)<=2 delta, whereas a net uses an open ball and requires a strict bound. Choosing the original scale strictly below the requested net radius, or using a larger radius, closes this, but the written inference is not valid as stated.
- **s8a-9bc2614340836ba932fd9836 · `thm-kolmogorov-extension-for-standard-borel-coordinate-spaces`** (from group h, gap-a-reader-closes) — Proof 2.1 invokes successive convergent-subsequence extraction and a diagonal limit from the compact finite-coordinate bases, but its cited facts establish only finite products being standard Borel and inner regularity. It does not state or cite the needed compact-metric sequential compactness/diagonal argument, nor explicitly transport those compact bases to compatible Polish product presentations. This is the central compactness step in the asserted continuity-at-empty-set proof.
- **s8a-7ee11d610f1a1f5ac356d7f1 · `ex-a-large-y-part-in-a-structural-comb-partition`** (from group h, gap-a-reader-closes) — Verification 1.1 says [F1] yields a clique or stable set of size at least (16/2)^(1/2)=sqrt(8). But [F1] cites the large-Y lemma whose stated conclusion is only at least w^(c/2), which here is 2. The stronger sqrt(8) bound appears in that lemma's proof, not its Statement, and this example supplies no separate Erdős–Hajnal fact from which to derive it.

Append one owning-group disposition per warning to `research/frontier-31a-step8-alert-decisions.jsonl`.
A Step-7 reader warning may be adjudicated `confirmed_fatal` and repaired with exact
pre/post guard hashes. A later Step-8 cross-group alert still requires a real targeted
judge rejection; never reuse its source rejection as target evidence.

## Your rejections

**None open at render time.** That is a real outcome, not an error: Terra
may have passed every item you own. Verify it against
`research/frontier-31a-judge.jsonl` yourself before reporting nothing to do —
a rejection recorded after this file was rendered is still yours.

# Step 8 — targeted repair-integrity review, `frontier-31a`

The generated repair envelope above is authoritative. It supplies every failed
gate with full output, the exact live ids and rejection tuples, and each id's
run or published scope. Take only its `assigned_items` and `live_tuples`; rerun
the focused gate where it supports item scope.

Complete a repair already licensed by an exact `confirmed_fatal` adjudication,
or correct a documentary contract/manifest/impact/verification record that must
match the current proof. Do not edit a nonfatal or false-positive item, broaden
the scope, run a judge sweep, or run a workflow transition.

Preserve append-only ledgers and return the gate, ids, licensing rows, changed
files, targeted checks, and blocker. This task applies before `8-rejudge`; a
frozen-cutover dispatch uses the Step-8 close task instead.
