# Step 8 — exact closure recovery, run `frontier-18`

You are a **group Alpha**. The step-8 judge-closure gate found current rejection
rows that the preceding adjudication did not cover. This is a narrow recovery
dispatch, not a second audit.

Your group is named in the context above. If you are reading this file
standalone, open `research/frontier-18-step8-scope.json` and find the group whose
batches you were dispatched against before anything else — every scope rule below
is relative to it.

## Exact scope

Read `research/frontier-18-judge-closure.json`. Its `unadjudicated_rows` array names
each `(id, model, context_sha256)` rejection with no exact Alpha outcome.
Recompute that join against `research/frontier-18-judge.jsonl` and
`research/frontier-18-judge-adjudications.jsonl`; exclude null, capacity, transport
and already-adjudicated rows.

**The receipt is level-wide and you are not.** Step 8 is partitioned: keep only
the rows whose `id` belongs to your group, using `by_item` in
`research/frontier-18-step8-scope.json`. A row belonging to another group is that
group's to answer and the engine dispatches it there — taking it yourself
produces two adjudications of one rejection, which is the state the partition
exists to prevent. A row belonging to **no** group is different and you must not
drop it silently: adjudicate it if you can decide it honestly, and say so
explicitly in your report either way.

For a legacy receipt without `unadjudicated_rows`, use its `unadjudicated` ids
only to reconstruct the missing exact keys from those two ledgers. Do not widen
the scope to other rejections. Preserve the existing step-8 reports and every
existing adjudication as durable prior work — including other groups' — and do
not redo, replace or reinterpret them.

## Fatal-only adjudication

For every exact missing row in your scope:

1. Read the frozen verdict, current item, and every cited target needed to
   decide it. You may read the entire library; you may write only inside your
   own batches.
2. **Append** exactly one row to
   `research/frontier-18-judge-adjudications.jsonl` with
   `{id, model, context_sha256, item_sha256, outcome, defect_type?}`. The file is
   shared with the other groups and is append-only: never rewrite it, and never
   remove a row another group wrote.
3. Compute `item_sha256` from the pre-edit item using the step-8 guard/touchlog
   normalization, which excludes the entire `verification:` block. Do not copy
   the differently normalized hash from the judge ledger.
4. A `confirmed_nonfatal` or `false_positive` outcome licenses no mutation.
5. Only `confirmed_fatal` licenses a coherent repair. Apply that repair, append
   its defect-ledger row in the same act, and update only the established
   contract, manifest, plan, impact and rejudge artifacts the repair makes
   stale. Never broaden the rejudge set to an unchanged page-mate.
6. If the real defect lies in another group's item, record it in
   `research/frontier-18-step8-cross-group.jsonl` as
   `{from_group, item, owning_group, model, context_sha256, finding}` and
   adjudicate your own row on what is true. Do not repair it.

Run the step-8 guard from the `pre-step8` baseline and recompute judge closure
with pending rejudge allowed. **Both are level-wide and will report other
groups' open work as well as yours** — that is expected while the other
recoveries are still running, and it is not yours to close. Your part is complete
when no row in *your* scope is unadjudicated and no fatal of yours is open;
materially repaired ids may remain in `needs_rejudge` for the engine-owned
rejudge stage.

## Output

`research/frontier-18-alpha-step8-closure-recovery-<label>.md`, where `<label>` is
your group. **The label is not optional.** Four groups can be recovering at once,
and a shared filename means the last writer destroys the others' findings —
which is exactly how eleven fatal findings were lost once when reader-7 wrote
over reader-1's report.

List every exact row you took, its evidence and outcome, every licensed repair,
the resulting rejudge targets, any cross-group finding you raised, any row you
found belonging to no group, and the gate results. Do not append this recovery
onto a stale or earlier step-8 report.

No permission prompts of any kind.
