## Statement

For all real $x,y$,
$$\exp(x+y)=\exp(x)\exp(y).$$

## Facts & Assumptions

**Given:** $x,y\in\mathbb R$.

[L1] For fixed $x,y$, the auxiliary power series $\sum_{n\ge0}x^nz^n/\iota(n!)$ and $\sum_{n\ge0}y^nz^n/\iota(n!)$ have infinite radius by [[lem-exponential-series-has-infinite-radius]]. Inside their common radius, their product is the Cauchy product of their coefficients ([[lem-cauchy-product-of-real-power-series]]).

[L2] The binomial theorem says $(x+y)^n=\sum_{k=0}^n\iota\binom nk x^ky^{n-k}$ ([[thm-binomial-theorem]], [[def-binomial-coefficient]]).

[L3] For $k\le n$, $\iota\binom nk=\iota(n!)/(\iota(k!)\iota((n-k)!))$ ([[thm-binomial-closed-formula]]). Therefore $1/(\iota(k!)\iota((n-k)!))=\iota\binom nk/\iota(n!)$, with all naturals read in $\mathbb R$ through [[def-canonical-natural]].

## Proof

**Proof technique:** direct.

1.1 Apply [L1] at the auxiliary value $z=1$. The coefficient of degree $n$ in the resulting Cauchy product for $\exp(x)\exp(y)$ is $\sum_{k=0}^n x^ky^{n-k}/(\iota(k!)\iota((n-k)!))$.   [L1, given]

2.1 Apply [L3] and [L2] to identify this finite sum with $(x+y)^n/\iota(n!)$.  [step 1.1, L2, L3, algebra]

3.1 Summing over $n$ gives the exponential series at $x+y$, hence the formula.  [step 2.1, L1] ∎
