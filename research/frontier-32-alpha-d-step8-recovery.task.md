# Step 8 adjudication — group **d**, run `frontier-32`

You are the group Alpha for batches **7**, **16**, **17**: 4 A/B pair(s), 8 page(s), 97 item(s), 0 open rejection(s) over 0 item(s).

This is a fresh adjudication context. The durable digest below carries the
findings from the rejection-blind whole-group reading at step 7 without
replaying that reader's transcript. Nothing from step 3, step 6, or another
group is assumed.
Everything below is
derived from disk by `tools/step8-scope.mjs`; no line of it is a judgement
about mathematics.

## What you recorded at step 7

`research/frontier-32-alpha-d-step8-context.json` is what a group Alpha for this group wrote during step 7,
while the judges were still sweeping and no verdict existed. It records the
conventions your pages fix, which items the rest lean on, which published
dependencies were actually opened, and what already looked thin.

**Its `concerns` list is evidence, not decoration.** Each entry was found with
nobody suggesting where to look. A judge rejection landing at the same place is
two independent readings agreeing and should be very hard to call a
`false_positive`; a rejection landing nowhere near any of them is not thereby
wrong, but it is the case to read most carefully against the text.

It is notes, not authority. Where it and the item files disagree, the files win.

## Read scope, write scope

**Read the entire assigned group and anything it cites.** `items/` holds every published item and
every item this run has built, and your sandbox is the repository root. Open
anything a rejection touches — a published dependency, another group's page,
a definition three levels down. Adjudicating a citation objection without
opening the cited item is exactly what the refuter rule forbids.

**You may write only inside your own group.** A `confirmed_fatal` licenses a
repair to an item in the batches listed above. If a rejection's real defect
lies in an item owned by another group, do not repair it: record the finding
in `research/frontier-32-step8-cross-group.jsonl` as
`{from_group, item, owning_group, finding, severity, source_rejection:{id,model,context_sha256}}`
and adjudicate your own rejection on what is true. The source tuple is
provenance only; it cannot license a repair to the target. The gate routes a
stable alert to the owning group, and a finding nobody answers fails the stage.

## Your seams

**No dependency edge crosses your group boundary.** Every `requires` your
pages declare points inside your own batches or at published content. A
cross-group finding is therefore unexpected here; if you record one, say
what made you look.

## Step-7 reader warnings

1 warning(s) a Step-7 reader recorded in items you own.
They were read-only and could not repair or adjudicate them. You own these decisions.

- **s8a-3719497e29b7e7a6567f56d2 · `thm-prime-support-of-the-different-is-ramification`** (from group d, would-be-fatal) — The stated iff is false under the page's own convention that a rational prime is ramified if some prime above it has e>1. From p|N(D_K) one obtains that some P over p divides D_K, not that every P over p does. Mixed factorisation occurs: for K=Q(θ), θ a root of x^3-x^2-3x+1 (discriminant 148), modulo 37 the polynomial is (x-4)^2(x-30). Thus 37 ramifies, but the prime attached to x-30 has e=1 and does not divide the different. The correct local condition is that P divides D_K iff P itself ramifies.

Append one owning-group disposition per warning to `research/frontier-32-step8-alert-decisions.jsonl`.
A Step-7 reader warning may be adjudicated `confirmed_fatal` and repaired with exact
pre/post guard hashes. A later Step-8 cross-group alert still requires a real targeted
judge rejection; never reuse its source rejection as target evidence.

## Your rejections

**None open at render time.** That is a real outcome, not an error: Terra
may have passed every item you own. Verify it against
`research/frontier-32-judge.jsonl` yourself before reporting nothing to do —
a rejection recorded after this file was rendered is still yours.

# Step 8 — exact closure recovery, `frontier-32`

Read `research/frontier-32-judge-closure.json`,
`research/frontier-32-judge.jsonl`,
`research/frontier-32-judge-adjudications.jsonl`, and the generated `by_item`
ownership map in `research/frontier-32-step8-scope.json`. Take only current
unadjudicated `(id, model, context_sha256)` rows owned by this group; leave
other groups' rows untouched. A row owned by no group is a reported blocker,
not a row to discard.

Append one exact adjudication outcome per owned row. Only
`confirmed_fatal` licenses its coherent repair and matching ledger row; update
only records made stale by that repair. Send a concrete other-group finding to
`research/frontier-32-step8-cross-group.jsonl`, never repair that item.

Every `confirmed_fatal` row must also set `defect_type` to exactly one of
`logic`, `dependency_citation`, or `other`. Do not use a descriptive
defect-ledger subclass in that field.

Write `research/frontier-32-alpha-step8-closure-recovery-<group>.md` with the rows
handled, outcomes, licensed repairs, rejudge targets, cross-group alerts, and
blockers. Preserve shared append-only ledgers.
